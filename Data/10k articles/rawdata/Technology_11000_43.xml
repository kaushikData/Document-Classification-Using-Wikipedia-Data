'''AOMedia Video 1''' ('''AV1''') is an [[open format|open]], [[royalty-free]] [[video coding format]] designed for video transmissions over the Internet. It is being developed by the [[Alliance for Open Media]] (AOMedia), a consortium of firms from the semiconductor industry, [[video on demand]] providers, and web browser developers, founded in 2015. The AV1 bitstream specification includes a reference [[video codec]].

AV1 is meant to succeed its predecessor [[VP9]] and compete with [[High Efficiency Video Coding|HEVC]]/H.265 from the [[Moving Picture Experts Group]].&lt;ref name="VP9 successor"/&gt; It is the primary contender for standardization by the video standard working group [[NetVC]] of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).&lt;ref name="blend"/&gt; The group has put together a list of criteria to be met by the new video standard.&lt;ref name="netvc"/&gt;

AV1 is intended to be able to be used together with the audio format [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] in a future version of the [[WebM]] container format for [[HTML5 video|HTML5 web video]] and [[WebRTC]].&lt;ref name="codec wars"/&gt;

==History==
The first official announcement of the project came with the press release on the formation of the Alliance on 1 September 2015.&lt;ref name="AOMPR2015September" /&gt;
The increased usage of its predecessor VP9 is attributed to confidence in the Alliance and development of AV1 as well as the pricey and complicated licensing situation of HEVC ([[High Efficiency Video Coding]]).&lt;ref name="tb_lca" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tb_lca_slides" /&gt;

The roots of the project precede the Alliance, however.
Individual contributors started experimental technology platforms years before: Xiph's/Mozilla's [[Daala]] already published code in 2010, VP10 was announced on 12 September 2014,&lt;ref name="CNETVP10September2014" /&gt; and Cisco's [[Thor (video codec)|Thor]] was published on 11 August 2015.
The first version 0.1.0 of the AV1 reference codec was published on 7 April 2016.

Soft [[feature freeze]] was at the end of October 2017, but a few significant features were decided to continue developing beyond this. The [[bitstream format]] was projected to be frozen in January 2018;&lt;ref name="jai-stswe2017"/&gt; however, this was delayed due to unresolved critical bugs as well as last changes to transformations, syntax, the prediction of motion vectors, and the completion of legal analysis.&lt;ref name="FOSDEM2018"/&gt; The Alliance announced the release of the AV1 bitstream specification on 28 March 2018, along with a reference, software-based encoder and decoder.&lt;ref name=final_release_announcement&gt;{{cite press release|title=The Alliance for Open Media Kickstarts Video Innovation Era with “AV1” Release|url=https://aomedia.org/the-alliance-for-open-media-kickstarts-video-innovation-era-with-av1-release/|date=28 March 2018|location=Wakefield, Mass|author=Alliance for Open Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shilov|first1=Anton|title=Alliance for Open Media Releases Royalty-Free AV1 1.0 Codec Spec|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/12601/alliance-for-open-media-releases-royaltyfree-av1-10-codec-spec|website=AnandTech|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June 2018, a validated version 1.0.0 of the specification was released.&lt;ref name="AV1Specification"&gt;{{cite web|title=AV1 Bitstream and Decoding Process Specification|url=https://aomedia.org/av1-bitstream-and-decoding-process-specification/|website=Alliance for Open Media|accessdate=26 June 2018|quote=This version 1.0.0 of the AV1 Bitstream Specification corresponds to the Git tag v1.0.0 in the AOMediaCodec/av1-spec project.

Martin Smole from AOM member Bitmovin says that the computational efficiency of the reference encoder is the greatest remaining challenge after the bitstream format freeze.&lt;ref name="encoder speed"/&gt; While still working on the format, the encoder was not targeted for productive use and didn't receive any speed optimizations. Therefore, it works orders of magnitude slower than e.g. existing HEVC encoders, and development is planned to shift its focus towards maturing the reference encoder after the freeze.

==Purpose==
AV1 aims to be a video format for the web that is both [[state of the art]] and [[royalty free]].&lt;ref name="daede-demuxed2017"/&gt; The mission of the Alliance for Open Media is the same as that of the [[WebM]] project.&lt;ref name="frost-sme2017"/&gt;

To fulfill the goal of being royalty free, the development process is such that no feature is adopted before it has been independently double checked that it does not infringe on patents of competing companies.&lt;ref name="frost-sme2017"/&gt;
This contrasts with its main competitor [[HEVC]], for which a review of the intellectual property rights ([[Intellectual property rights|IPR]] review) was not part of the standardization process.&lt;ref name="tb_lca"/&gt; The latter reviewing practice is stipulated in the [[Open standard#ITU-T definition|ITU-T's definition of an open standard]].

The possible existence of yet unknown patents has been a recurring concern in the field of royalty-free multimedia formats; the concern has been raised regarding AV1,&lt;ref name="ip remains"/&gt; and previously VP9,&lt;ref name="comes of age"/&gt; Theora&lt;ref name="patents and standards"/&gt; and IVC.&lt;ref name="ivc"/&gt; The problem of unforeseen patents is not unique to royalty-free formats, but it uniquely threatens their ''status'' as royalty-free. In contrast, IPR avoidance has not traditionally been a priority in MPEG's business model for royalty-bearing formats (although the MPEG chairman argues it has to change).&lt;ref name="crisis"/&gt;

Under patent rules adopted from the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), technology contributors license their AV1-connected patents to anyone, anywhere, anytime based on reciprocity, i.e. as long as the user does not engage in patent litigation.&lt;ref name="patent license"/&gt; As a defensive condition, anyone engaging in patent litigation loses the right to the patents of ''all'' patent holders.&lt;ref name="tb_lca"/&gt;

The performance goals include "a step up from VP9 and HEVC" in efficiency for a low increase in [[analysis of algorithms|complexity]].&lt;ref name="frost-sme2017"/&gt; NETVC's efficiency goal is 25% improvement over HEVC.&lt;ref name="netvc"/&gt; The primary complexity concern is for software decoding, since hardware support will take time to reach users.&lt;ref name="frost-sme2017"/&gt; However, for [[WebRTC]], live encoding performance is also relevant, which is Cisco's agenda: [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] is a manufacturer of [[videoconferencing]] equipment, and their Thor contributions aim at "reasonable compression at only moderate complexity".&lt;ref name="integrating-thor"/&gt;

Feature wise, it is specifically designed for [[real-time application]]s (especially WebRTC) and higher resolutions (wider color [[gamut]]s, higher [[frame rate]]s, [[ultra-high-definition television|UHD]]) than typical usage scenarios of the current generation (H.264) of video formats where it is expected to achieve its biggest efficiency gains. It is therefore planned to support the color space from [[Rec. 2020|ITU-R Recommendation BT.2020]] and up to 12 bits of [[color depth|precision]] per color component.&lt;ref name="streamingmedia-111497" /&gt; AV1 is primarily intended for [[Lossy compression|lossy encoding]], although [[lossless compression]] is supported as well.&lt;ref name="lossless" /&gt;

AV1-based containers have also been proposed as a replacement for [[JPEG]], similar to [[Better Portable Graphics]] and [[High Efficiency Image File Format]] which wrap HEVC.&lt;ref name="vsJPEG"/&gt;

==Technology==
{{See also|VP9#Technology}}
AV1 is a traditional block-based [[frequency transform]] format featuring new techniques, several of which were developed in experimental formats that have been testing technology for a next-generation format after HEVC and VP9.&lt;ref name="bitformat"/&gt; Based on Google's experimental VP9 evolution project ''VP10'',&lt;ref name="basis" /&gt; AV1 incorporates additional techniques developed in Xiph's/Mozilla's [[Daala]] and Cisco's [[Thor (video codec)|Thor]].

The Alliance published a [[reference implementation]] written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[assembly language]] (&lt;code&gt;aomenc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;aomdec&lt;/code&gt;) as [[free software]] under the terms of the [[BSD 2-Clause License]].&lt;ref name="license" /&gt;  Development happens in public and is open for contributions, regardless of AOM membership.

There is another open source encoder, namely ''rav1e'', which – unlike aomenc – aims to be the simplest and fastest conforming encoder at the expense of efficiency.&lt;ref name="rav1e" /&gt;

The development process is such that coding tools are added to the reference codebase as ''experiments'', controlled by flags that enable or disable them at build time, for review by other group members as well as specialized teams that help with and ensure hardware friendliness and compliance with intellectual property rights (TAPAS). Once the feature gains some support in the community, the experiment can be enabled by default, and ultimately have its flag removed when all of the reviews are passed.&lt;ref name="streamingmedia-august-update"/&gt; Experiment names are lowercased in the ''configure'' script and uppercased in [[conditional compilation]] flags.&lt;ref name="merge-dist"/&gt;

===Data transformation===
To transform the error remaining after prediction to the frequency domain, AV1 uses square and 2:1/1:2 rectangular [[Discrete cosine transform|DCT]]s, as well as an asymmetric [[Discrete sine transform|DST]]&lt;ref&gt;Jingning Han, Ankur Saxena, Vinay Melkote, and Kenneth Rose, [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1341/44251f0b164a1c2b1e36c06665cfe17f4aa5.pdf Jointly Optimized Spatial Prediction and Block Transform for Video and Image Coding], IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; for blocks where the top and/or left edge is expected to have lower error thanks to prediction from nearby pixels.

It can combine two one-dimensional transforms in order to use different transforms for the horizontal and the vertical dimension (&lt;code&gt;ext_tx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name="instate-ext-tx"/&gt;).&lt;ref name="ittiam-ibc"/&gt;

===Partitioning===
[[File:AV1 coding unit partitioning.svg|thumb|T-shaped partitioning|upright=0.6]]
Prediction can happen for bigger units (≤128×128), and they can be subpartitioned in more ways. "T-shaped" partitioning schemes for coding units are introduced, a feature developed for VP10, as well as horizontal or vertical splits into four stripes of 4:1 aspect ratio. Two separate predictions can now be used on spatially different parts of a block using a smooth, oblique transition line (''wedge-partitioned prediction'').&lt;ref name="VP10_1_year_in_presentation"/&gt; This enables more accurate separation of objects without the traditional staircase lines along the boundaries of square blocks.

More encoder parallelism is possible thanks to configurable prediction dependency between tile rows.&lt;ref name="ittiam_decodes_av1_jargon" /&gt;

===Prediction===
AV1 performs internal processing in higher precision (10 or 12 bits per sample), which leads to compression improvement due to smaller rounding errors in reference imagery.

Predictions can be combined in more advanced ways (than a uniform average) in a block (''compound prediction''), including smooth and sharp transition gradients in different directions (''wedge-partitioned prediction'') as well as implicit masks that are based on the difference between the two predictors. This allows combination of either two inter predictions or an inter and an intra prediction to be used in the same block.&lt;ref name="VP10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VP10_1_year_in_presentation" /&gt;

A frame can reference 6 instead of 3 of the 8 available frame buffers for temporal (inter) prediction.
[[File:Bergensbanen 1280x720.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=184|Warped motion as seen from the front of a train.]]
The  ''Warped Motion'' (&lt;code&gt;warped_motion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name="instate-warped-motion"/&gt;)&lt;ref name="ittiam-ibc"/&gt; and  ''Global Motion'' (&lt;code&gt;global_motion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name="instate-global-motion"/&gt;) tools in AV1 aim to reduce redundant information in [[motion vector]]s by recognizing patterns arising from camera motion.&lt;ref name="ittiam_decodes_av1_jargon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ittiam-ibc"/&gt; They implement ideas that were tried to be exploited in preceding formats like e.g. MPEG-4 ASP, albeit with a novel approach that works in three dimensions. There can be a set of warping parameters for a whole frame offered in the bitstream, or blocks can use a set of implicit local parameters that get computed based on surrounding blocks.

For intra prediction, there are 56 (instead of 8) angles for directional prediction and weighted filters for per-pixel extrapolation. The "TrueMotion" predictor got replaced with a [[Paeth filter|Paeth]] predictor which looks at the difference from the known pixel in the above left corner to the pixel directly above and directly left of the new one and then chooses the one that lies in direction of the smaller gradient as predictor. A palette predictor is available for blocks with very few colors like in some computer screen content. Correlations between the luminosity and the color information can now be exploited with a predictor for chroma blocks that is based on samples from the luma plane (&lt;code&gt;cfl&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;ref name="ittiam-ibc"/&gt; In order to reduce discontinuities along borders of inter-predicted blocks, predictors can be overlapped and blended with those of neighbouring blocks (''overlapped block motion compensation'').
&lt;ref name="SPIE'17 pred"/&gt;

===Quantization===
AV1 has new optimized quantization matrices.&lt;ref name="enab-aom-qm"/&gt;

===Filters===
For the in-loop filtering step, the integration of Thor's constrained low-pass filter and Daala's directional deringing filter has been fruitful: The combined ''Constrained Directional Enhancement Filter'' (&lt;code&gt;cdef&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name="instate-cdef"/&gt;) exceeds the results of using the original filters separately or together.&lt;ref name="cdef"/&gt;&lt;ref name="netvc99"/&gt;
It is an edge-directed conditional replacement filter that smoothes blocks with configurable (signaled) strength roughly along the direction of the dominant edge to eliminate [[ringing artifacts]].

There is also the ''loop restoration filter'' (&lt;code&gt;loop_restoration&lt;/code&gt;) to remove blur artifacts due to block processing.&lt;ref name="ittiam-ibc"/&gt;

''Film grain synthesis'' (&lt;code&gt;film_grain&lt;/code&gt;) improves coding of noisy signals using a parametric video coding approach.
Due to the randomness inherent to film grain noise, this signal component is traditionally either very expensive to code or prone to get damaged or lost, possibly leaving serious coding artefacts as residue. This tool circumvents these problems using analysis and synthesis, replacing parts of the signal with a visually similar synthetic texture, based solely on subjective visual impression instead of objective similarity. It removes the grain component from the signal, analyzes its non-random characteristics, and instead transmits only descriptive parameters to the decoder, which adds back a synthetic, pseudorandom noise signal that's shaped after the original component.

===Entropy coding===
Daala's entropy coder (&lt;code&gt;daala_ec&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name="instate-daala-ec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="daala_ec"/&gt;), a non-binary [[arithmetic coding|arithmetic coder]], was selected for replacing VP9's binary entropy coder. The use of ''non-binary'' arithmetic coding helps evade patents, but also adds bit-level parallelism to an otherwise serial process, reducing clock rate demands on hardware implementations.&lt;ref name="tb_lca_slides"/&gt; This is to say that the effectiveness of modern binary arithmetic coding like [[CABAC]] is being approached using a greater alphabet than binary, hence greater speed, as in [[Huffman code]] (but not as simple and fast as Huffman code).
AV1 also gained the ability to adapt the symbol probabilities in the arithmetic coder per coded symbol instead of per frame (&lt;code&gt;ec_adapt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name="instate-ec-adapt"/&gt;).&lt;ref name="ittiam-ibc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tb_lca"/&gt;

===Notable abandoned features===
''Daala Transforms'' were the major innovation behind the daala codec.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/daala/demo1.shtml|title=next generation video: Introducing Daala|website=people.xiph.org|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; They implement "lapped" discrete cosine and sine transforms that its authors describe as "better in every way" than the &lt;code&gt;txmg&lt;/code&gt; set of transforms that prevailed in AV1.&lt;ref name="daala-tx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="daala_tx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="daala_tx_update"/&gt;&lt;ref name="daala_tx_eval"/&gt;&lt;ref name="daala_tx_info"/&gt; Both the &lt;code&gt;txmg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;daala_tx&lt;/code&gt; experiments have merged high and low bitdepth code paths (unlike VP9), but &lt;code&gt;daala_tx&lt;/code&gt; achieved full embedding of smaller transforms within larger, as well as using fewer multiplies, which could have further reduced the cost of hardware implementations. The Daala transforms were kept as optional in the experimental codebase until late January 2018, but changing hardware blocks at a late stage was a general concern for delaying hardware availability.&lt;ref name="smw2017-future-of-video-codecs"/&gt;

The encoding complexity of Daala's [[Perceptual Vector Quantization]] was too much within the already complex framework of AV1.&lt;ref name="tb_lca_slides"/&gt; The ''Rate Distortion'' &lt;code&gt;dist_8x8&lt;/code&gt; heuristic aims to speed up the encoder by a sizable factor, PVQ or not,&lt;ref name="tb_lca_slides"/&gt; but PVQ was ultimately dropped.

[[Asymmetric Numeral Systems|ANS]] was the other non-binary arithmetic coder, developed in parallel with Daala's entropy coder. Of the two, Daala EC was the more hardware friendly, but ANS was the fastest to decode in software.&lt;ref name="tb_lca"/&gt;

==Quality and efficiency==
A first comparison from the beginning of June 2016&lt;ref name="golem20160609" /&gt; found AV1 roughly on par with HEVC, as did one using code from late January 2017.&lt;ref name="elecard_comparison" /&gt;

In April 2017, using the 8 enabled experimental features at the time (of 77 total), [[Bitmovin]] was able to demonstrate favorable [[Video quality|objective metrics]], as well as visual results, compared to HEVC on the ''[[Sintel]]'' and ''[[Tears of Steel]]'' animated films.&lt;ref name="bitmovin_moves_in" /&gt; A follow-up comparison by [[Jan Ozer]] of ''[[Streaming Media Magazine]]'' confirmed this, and concluded that "AV1 is at least as good as HEVC now".&lt;ref name="ozer_compares_hevc" /&gt;

Ozer noted that his and Bitmovin's results contradicted a comparison by [[Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications]] from late 2016&lt;ref name="comparison_by_hhi" /&gt; that had found AV1 38.4% less efficient than HEVC, underperforming even H.264/AVC, and justified this discrepancy by having used encoding parameters endorsed by each encoder vendor, as well as having more features in the newer AV1 encoder.

Tests from Netflix showed that, based on measurements with [[Peak signal-to-noise ratio|PSNR]] and [[Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion|VMAF]] at 720p, AV1 could be about 25% more efficient than VP9 (libvpx), at the expense of a 4–10 fold increase in encoding complexity.&lt;ref name="Netflix"/&gt; Similar conclusions with respect to quality were drawn from a test conducted by [[Moscow State University]] researchers, where VP9 was found to require 31% and HEVC 22% more bitrate than AV1 for the same level of quality.&lt;ref name="MSU2017-1"/&gt; The researchers found that the used AV1 encoder was operating at a speed “2500–3500 times lower than competitors”, while admitting that it has not been optimized yet.&lt;ref name="MSU2017-2"/&gt;

In a comparison of AV1 against H.264 (x264) and VP9 (libvpx), Facebook showed about 45–50% bitrate savings over H.264 and about 40% over VP9 when using a constant quality encoding mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.facebook.com/posts/253852078523394/av1-beats-x264-and-libvpx-vp9-in-practical-use-case/|title=AV1 beats x264 and libvpx-vp9 in practical use case|website=Facebook Code|language=en|access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AOMedia provides a list of test results [https://aomedia.org/news/av1-test-results/ on their website].

==Profiles and levels==

=== Profiles ===
AV1 defines three profiles for decoders which are '''Main''', '''High''', and '''Professional'''. The Main profile allows for a bit depth of 8- or 10-bits per sample with 4:0:0 (greyscale) and 4:2:0 [[Chroma subsampling|chroma sampling]]. The High profile allows for a bit depth of 8- or 10-bits per sample with 4:4:4 chroma sampling. The Professional profile allows for a bit depth of 12-bits per sample with 4:0:0, 4:2:0, and 4:4:4 chroma sampling, and 8, 10 or 12 bits per sample with 4:2:2 chroma sampling.&lt;ref name="AV1Specification"/&gt;

== Adoption ==
Like its predecessor VP9, AV1 can be used inside WebM container files alongside the Opus audio format. These formats are well supported among web browsers, with the exception of [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (only has Opus support) and the discontinued Internet Explorer (prior to Edge) (see VP9 in [[HTML5 video support|HTML5 video]]).

From November 2017 onwards, nightly builds of the [[Firefox]] web browser contained preliminary support for AV1.&lt;ref name="FFnightly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFnightly-2"/&gt; Upon its release on 9 February 2018, version 3.0.0 of the [[VLC media player]] shipped with an experimental AV1 decoder.&lt;ref name="VLC3Release"/&gt; Firefox 64 is planned for first official release. It is available in Firefox 63 and Google Chrome 70, but it is deactivated in standard configuration of Firefox 63. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ghacks.net/2018/09/13/how-to-enable-av1-support-on-youtube/&lt;/ref&gt;

It is expected that Alliance members have interest in adopting the format, in respective ways, once the bitstream is frozen.&lt;ref name="streamingmedia-111497"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bitmovin_moves_in"/&gt; The member companies represent several industries, including browser vendors ([[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Google]], [[Mozilla]], [[Microsoft]]), content distributors (Apple, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Facebook]], Google, [[Hulu]], [[Netflix]]) and hardware designers ([[AMD]], Apple, [[Arm Holdings|Arm]], [[Broadcom]], [[Intel]], [[Nvidia]]).&lt;ref name="tb_lca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tb_lca_slides"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Apple"/&gt;
Video streaming service [[YouTube]] declared intent to transition to the new format as fast as possible, starting with highest resolutions within six months after the finalization of the bitstream format.&lt;ref name="streamingmedia-111497"/&gt;
Netflix "expects to be an early adopter of AV1".&lt;ref name="frost-sme2017"/&gt;

According to Mukund Srinivasan, chief business officer of AOM member [[Ittiam Systems|Ittiam]], early hardware support will be dominated by software running on non-CPU hardware (such as [[General-purpose computing on graphics processing units|GPGPU]], [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] or [[shader]] programs, as is the case with some [[VP9#Hardware implementations|VP9 hardware implementations]]), as fixed-function hardware will take 12–18 months after bitstream freeze until chips are available, plus 6 months for products based on those chips to hit the market.&lt;ref name="streamingmedia-august-update"/&gt; The bitstream was finally frozen on 28 March 2018, meaning chips could be available sometime between March and August 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ozer |first=Jan |url=http://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/News/Online-Video-News/AV1-Is-Finally-Here-but-Intellectual-Property-Questions-Remain-124134.aspx |title=AV1 Is Finally Here, but Intellectual Property Questions Remain |work=Streaming Media Magazine |date=28 March 2018 |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the above forecast, products based on chips could then be on the market at the end of 2019 or the beginning of 2020.

Mozilla researchers Nathan Egge and Michael Bebenita claimed in an interview in April 2018 that the web browser Mozilla Firefox would have AV1 support enabled by default by the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ozer |first=Jan |url=http://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/NAB-2018-Mozilla-Talks-Daala-Firefox-and-AV1-124396.aspx?CategoryID=422 |title=NAB 2018: Mozilla Talks Daala, Firefox, and AV1 |work=Streaming Media Magazine |date=16 April 2018 |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AV1 support has been added to the [[ISOBMFF|MP4 container]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdn.rawgit.com/AOMediaCodec/av1-isobmff/v1.0.0/index.html|title=AV1 Codec ISO Media File Format Binding|website=cdn.rawgit.com|language=en|access-date=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[YouTube]] released a beta launch playlist of AV1 videos at high bit-rates to test decoder performance and show their commitment to AV1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyqf6gJt7KuHBmeVzZteZUlNUQAVLwrZS|title=AV1 Beta Launch Playlist - YouTube|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So we have an extensive IP diligence process which involves diligence on both the contributor level – so when Google proposes a tool, we are doing our in-house IP diligence, using our in-house patent assets and outside advisors – that is then forwarded to the group, and is then ''again'' reviewed by an outside counsel that is engaged by the alliance.

[[File:McIntosh MC2505.jpg|thumb|A 100 watt stereo audio amplifier used in home component audio systems in the 1970s.]]
 
[[File:Amplification2.svg|thumb|''Amplification'' means  increasing the [[amplitude]] (voltage or current) of a time-varying signal by a given factor, as shown here. The graph shows the input &lt;math&gt;v_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; ''&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;(blue)&lt;/span&gt;'' and output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_o(t)&lt;/math&gt; ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(red)&lt;/span&gt;'' of an ideal linear amplifier with an arbitrary signal applied as input.   
In this example the amplifier has a ''[[gain (electronics)|voltage gain]]'' of 3; that is at any instant &lt;math&gt;v_o = 3v_i\,&lt;/math&gt;]]

An '''amplifier''', '''electronic amplifier''' or (informally) '''amp''' is an electronic device that can increase the [[Power (physics)|power]] of a [[Signal (information theory)|signal]] (a time-varying [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]]). It is a [[two-port network|two-port]] electronic circuit that uses electric power from a [[power supply]] to increase the [[amplitude]] of a signal applied to its input terminals, producing a proportionally greater amplitude signal at its output.  The amount of amplification provided by an amplifier is measured by its [[gain (electronics)|gain]]: the ratio of output voltage, current, or power to input.  An amplifier is a circuit that has a [[power gain]] greater than one.&lt;ref name="Crecraft"&gt;{{cite book| last1  = Crecraft| first1 = David| last2  = Gorham| first2 = David| title  = Electronics, 2nd Ed.| publisher = CRC Press| date   = 2003| location = | pages  = 168| language = | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=Yq66DDW4f8IC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=amplifier+power| doi    = | id     = | isbn   = 0748770364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agarwal"&gt;{{cite book | last1  = Agarwal| first1 = Anant  | last2  = Lang  | first2 = Jeffrey | title  = Foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits| publisher = Morgan Kaufmann| date   = 2005| location = | pages  = 331| language = | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=lGgP7FDEv3AC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;dq=amplifier+power| doi    = | id     = | isbn   = 008050681X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glisson"&gt;{{cite book | last1  = Glisson | first1 = Tildon H. | title  = Introduction to Circuit Analysis and Design | publisher = Springer Science and Business Media | date   = 2011 | location = | pages 197  = | language = | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=7nNjaH9B0_0C&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=amplifier+power | doi    = | id  = | isbn   = 9048194431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An amplifier can either be a separate piece of equipment or an [[electrical circuit]] contained within another device. Amplification is fundamental to modern electronics, and amplifiers are widely used in almost all electronic equipment. Amplifiers can be categorized in different ways. One is by the [[frequency]] of the electronic signal being amplified. For example, [[audio amplifier]]s amplify signals in the [[Sound|audio]] (sound) range of less than 20&amp;nbsp;kHz, RF amplifiers amplify frequencies in the [[radio frequency]] range between 20&amp;nbsp;kHz and 300&amp;nbsp;GHz, and servo amplifiers and instrumentation amplifiers may work with very low frequencies down to direct current.   Amplifiers can also be categorized by their physical placement in the [[signal chain]]; a [[preamplifier]] may precede other signal processing stages, for example.&lt;ref name="Patronis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Patronis |first=Gene |chapter=Amplifiers |editor=Glen Ballou |title=Handbook for Sound Engineers: The New Audio Cyclopedia |year=1987 |publisher=Howard W. Sams &amp; Co. |isbn=0-672-21983-2 |page=493}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first practical electrical device which could amplify was the [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]], invented in 1906 by [[Lee De Forest]], which led to the first amplifiers around 1912.  Today most amplifiers use [[transistor]]s.

== History ==
The first practical device that could amplify was the [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]], invented in 1906 by [[Lee De Forest]], which led to the first amplifiers around 1912.  Vacuum tubes were used in almost all amplifiers until the 1960s–1970s when the [[transistor]], invented in 1947, replaced them.  Today, most amplifiers use transistors, but vacuum tubes continue to be used in some applications.
[[File:First Audion amplifier 1914.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|De Forest's prototype audio amplifier of 1914. The [[Audion]] (triode) vacuum tube had a voltage gain of about 5, providing a total gain of approximately 125 for this three-stage amplifier.]]

The development of audio communication technology in form of the [[telephone]], first patented in 1876, created the need to increase the amplitude of electrical signals to extend the transmission of signals over increasingly long distances. In [[telegraphy]], this problem had been solved with intermediate devices at stations that replenished the dissipated energy by operating a signal recorder and transmitter back-to-back, forming a [[relay]], so that a local energy source at each intermediate station powered the next leg of transmission.
For duplex transmission, i.e. sending and receiving in both directions, bi-directional relay repeaters were developed starting with the work of [[C. F. Varley]] for telegraphic transmission. Duplex transmission was essential for telephony and the problem was not satisfactorily solved until 1904, when H. E. Shreeve of the [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] improved existing attempts at constructing a [[Repeater#Telephone repeater|telephone repeater]] consisting of back-to-back [[carbon microphone|carbon-granule transmitter]] and electrodynamic receiver pairs.&lt;ref name="gherardi"&gt;Gherardi B., Jewett F.B., ''Telephone Repeaters'', Transactions of the AIEE 38(11), 1 Oct 1919, p.1298&lt;/ref&gt; The Shreeve repeater was first tested on a line between Boston and Amesbury, MA, and more refined devices remained in service for some time.  After the turn of the century it was found that negative resistance [[mercury lamp]]s could amplify, and were also tried in repeaters, with little success.&lt;ref name="Sungook"&gt;{{cite book

For 50 years virtually all consumer electronic devices used vacuum tubes.    Early tube amplifiers often had [[positive feedback]] ([[regenerative circuit|regeneration]]), which could increase gain but also make the amplifier unstable and prone to oscillation.  Much of the mathematical theory of amplifiers was developed at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] during the 1920s to 1940s.  Distortion levels in early amplifiers were high, usually around 5%, until 1934, when [[Harold Black]] developed [[Negative feedback amplifier|negative feedback]]; this allowed the distortion levels to be greatly reduced, at the cost of lower gain.  Other advances in the theory of amplification were made by [[Harry Nyquist]] and [[Hendrik Wade Bode]].&lt;ref name="Bode"&gt;{{cite journal

The vacuum tube was virtually the only amplifying device, other than specialized power devices such as the [[magnetic amplifier]] and [[amplidyne]], for 40 years.  Power control circuitry used magnetic amplifiers until the latter half of the twentieth century when power semiconductor devices became more economical, with higher operating speeds. The old Shreeve electroacoustic carbon repeaters were used in adjustable amplifiers in telephone subscriber sets for the hearing impaired until the transistor provided smaller and higher quality amplifiers in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;AT&amp;T, Bell System Practices Section C65.114, ''Telephone Sets for Subscribers with Impaired Hearing — 334 Type''&lt;/ref&gt;  

The replacement of bulky electron tubes with [[transistor]]s during the 1960s and 1970s created another revolution in electronics, making possible a large class of portable electronic devices, such as the [[transistor radio]] developed in 1954.  Today, use of vacuum tubes is limited for some high power applications, such as radio transmitters.

Beginning in the 1970s, more and more transistors were connected on a single chip thereby creating higher scales of integration (small-scale, medium-scale, large-scale, etc.) in [[integrated circuit]]s. Many amplifiers commercially available today are based on integrated circuits.

For special purposes, other active elements have been used. For example, in the early days of the [[satellite communication]], [[parametric amplifier]]s were used. The core circuit was a diode whose capacitance was changed by an RF signal created locally. Under certain conditions, this RF signal provided energy that was modulated by the extremely weak satellite signal received at the earth station.

Advances in digital electronics since the late 20th century provided new alternatives to the traditional linear-gain amplifiers by using digital switching to vary the pulse-shape of fixed amplitude signals, resulting in devices such as the [[Class-D amplifier]].

==Ideal==
[[File:Dependent Sources.PNG|thumbnail|300px|The four types of dependent source—control variable on left, output variable on right]]
In principle, an amplifier is an electrical [[two-port network]] that produces a signal at the output port that is a replica of the signal applied to the input port, but increased in magnitude.

The input port can be idealized as either being a voltage input, which takes no current, with the output proportional to the voltage across the port; or a current input, with no voltage across it, in which the output is proportional to the current through the port.  The output port can be idealized as being either a [[dependent voltage source]], with zero source resistance and its output voltage dependent on the input; or a [[dependent current source]], with infinite source resistance and the output current dependent on the input. Combinations of these choices lead to four types of ideal amplifiers.&lt;ref name="Patronis"/&gt; In idealized form they are represented by each of the four types of [[dependent source]] used in linear analysis, as shown in the figure, namely:

In real amplifiers the ideal impedances are not possible to achieve, but these ideal elements can be used to construct [[equivalent circuit]]s of real amplifiers by adding impedances (resistance, capacitance and inductance) to the input and output.   For any particular circuit, a small-signal analysis is often used to find the actual impedance. A small-signal AC test current ''I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is applied to the input or output node, all external sources are set to AC zero, and the corresponding alternating voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' across the test current source determines the impedance seen at that node as ''R = V&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; / I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eeherald.com/section/design-guide/signal_analysis_amplifiers.html|title=Small signal analysis of Complex amplifier circuits|website=www.eeherald.com|access-date=2016-06-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009041842/http://www.eeherald.com/section/design-guide/signal_analysis_amplifiers.html|archivedate=2016-10-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amplifiers designed to attach to a [[transmission line]] at input and output, especially [[RF power amplifier|RF amplifiers]], do not fit into this classification approach.  Rather than dealing with voltage or current individually, they ideally couple with an input or output impedance matched to the transmission line impedance, that is, match ''ratios'' of voltage to current.  Many real RF amplifiers come close to this ideal.  Although, for a given appropriate source and load impedance, RF amplifiers can be characterized as amplifying voltage or current, they fundamentally are amplifying power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Vsats: Very Small Aperture Terminals | author = John Everett | publisher = IET | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-86341-200-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MWuXmf4V4NwC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=amplifier+impedance+transmission-line++dB#PPA81,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
{{Main|Amplifier figures of merit}}
Amplifier properties are given by parameters that include: 
* [[Gain (electronics)|Gain]], the ratio between the magnitude of output and input signals
* [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|Bandwidth]], the width of the useful [[#Frequency range|frequency range]]
* [[Electrical efficiency|Efficiency]], the ratio between the power of the output and total power consumption
* [[Nonlinear system|Linearity]], the extent to which the proportion between input and output amplitude is the same for high amplitude and low amplitude input
* [[Noise (electronics)|Noise]], a measure of undesired noise mixed into the output
* Output [[dynamic range]], the ratio of the largest and the smallest useful output levels
* [[Slew rate]], the maximum rate of change of the output
* [[Rise time]], [[settling time]], [[Ringing (signal)|ringing]] and [[Overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] that characterize the [[step response]]
* [[BIBO stability|Stability]], the ability to avoid [[Parasitic oscillation|self-oscillation]]

Amplifiers are described according to the properties of their inputs, their outputs, and how they relate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory, 7th Edition | author = Robert Boylestad and Louis Nashelsky | publisher = Prentice Hall College Division | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-13-375734-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TRBTAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Electronic+Devices+and+Circuit+Theory&amp;dq=Electronic+Devices+and+Circuit+Theory }}&lt;/ref&gt; All amplifiers have gain, a multiplication factor that relates the magnitude of some property of the output signal to a property of the input signal. The gain may be specified as the ratio of output [[voltage]] to input voltage ([[voltage gain]]), output power to input power ([[power gain]]), or some combination of current, voltage, and power. In many cases the property of the output that varies is dependent on the same property of the input, making the gain unitless (though often expressed in [[decibel]]s (dB)).

Most amplifiers are designed to be linear. That is, they provide constant gain for any normal input level and output signal. If an amplifier's gain is not linear, the output signal can become [[Distortion|distorted]]. There are, however, cases where [[Variable-gain amplifier|variable gain]] is useful. Certain signal processing applications use exponential gain amplifiers.&lt;ref name="Patronis"/&gt;

Amplifiers are usually designed to function well in a specific application, for example: [[radio]] and [[television]] [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]], [[high-fidelity]] ("hi-fi") stereo equipment, microcomputers and other digital equipment, and [[guitar]] and other [[instrument amplifier]]s. Every amplifier includes at least one [[active device]], such as a [[vacuum tube]] or [[transistor]].

==Negative feedback==
[[Negative feedback]] is a technique used in most modern amplifiers to improve bandwidth and distortion and control gain.  In a negative feedback amplifier part of the output is fed back and added to the input in opposite phase, subtracting from the input.   The main effect is to reduce the overall gain of the system. However, any unwanted signals introduced by the amplifier, such as distortion are also fed back.  Since they are not part of the original input, they are added to the input in opposite phase, subtracting them from the input. In this way, negative feedback also reduces nonlinearity, distortion and other errors introduced by the amplifier. Large amounts of negative feedback can reduce errors to the point that the response of the amplifier itself becomes almost irrelevant as long as it has a large gain, and the output performance of the system (the "closed loop performance") is defined entirely by the components in the feedback loop.  This technique is particularly used with [[operational amplifier]]s (op-amps).

Non-feedback amplifiers can only achieve about 1% distortion for audio-frequency signals. With [[negative feedback]], distortion can typically be reduced to 0.001%.  Noise, even crossover distortion, can be practically eliminated.  Negative feedback also compensates for changing temperatures, and degrading or nonlinear components in the gain stage, but any change or nonlinearity in the components in the feedback loop will affect the output. Indeed, the ability of the feedback loop to define the output is used to make [[active filter|active filter circuits]]. 

Another advantage of negative feedback is that it extends the [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the amplifier.    The concept of feedback is used in [[operational amplifier]]s to precisely define gain, bandwidth, and other parameters entirely based on the components in the feedback loop.

Negative feedback can be applied at each stage of an amplifier to stabilize the [[operating point]] of active devices against minor changes in power-supply voltage or device characteristics.

Some feedback, positive or negative, is unavoidable and often undesirable—introduced, for example, by [[parasitic element (electrical networks)|parasitic elements]], such as inherent capacitance between input and output of devices such as transistors, and capacitive coupling of external wiring. Excessive frequency-dependent positive feedback can produce [[parasitic oscillation]] and turn an amplifier into an [[oscillator]].

== Categories ==
=== Active devices ===
All amplifiers include some form of active device: this is the device that does the actual amplification. The active device can be a [[vacuum tube]], discrete solid state component, such as a single [[transistor]], or part of an [[integrated circuit]], as in an [[operational amplifier|op-amp]]).

[[Transistor]] amplifiers (or solid state amplifiers) are the most common type of amplifier in use today. A transistor is used as the active element. The gain of the amplifier is determined by the properties of the transistor itself as well as the circuit it is contained within.

Common active devices in transistor amplifiers include [[bipolar junction transistor]]s (BJTs) and [[metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor]]s (MOSFETs).

Applications are numerous, some common examples are audio amplifiers in a home stereo or [[public address|public address system]], RF high power generation for semiconductor equipment, to RF and microwave applications such as radio transmitters.

Transistor-based amplification can be realized using various configurations: for example a bipolar junction transistor can realize [[common base]], [[common collector]] or [[common emitter]] amplification; a MOSFET can realize [[common gate]], [[common source]] or [[common drain]] amplification. Each configuration has different characteristics.

[[Valve amplifier|Vacuum-tube amplifiers]] (also known as tube amplifiers or valve amplifiers) use a [[vacuum tube]] as the active device. While semiconductor amplifiers have largely displaced valve amplifiers for low-power applications, valve amplifiers can be much more cost effective in high power applications such as radar, countermeasures equipment, and communications equipment. Many [[#Microwave amplifiers|microwave amplifiers]] are specially designed valve amplifiers, such as the [[klystron]], [[gyrotron]], [[traveling wave tube]], and [[crossed-field amplifier]], and these microwave valves provide much greater single-device power output at microwave frequencies than solid-state devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Robert S. Symons | title=Tubes: Still vital after all these years | journal=IEEE Spectrum | year=1998 | volume=35 | issue=4 | pages= 52–63 | doi=10.1109/6.666962 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vacuum tubes remain in use in some high end audio equipment, as well as in [[instrument amplifier|musical instrument amplifiers]], due to a preference for "[[tube sound]]".

[[Magnetic amplifier]]s are devices somewhat similar to a [[transformer]] where one winding is used to control the saturation of a magnetic core and hence alter the impedance of the other winding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ti.com/lit/ml/slup129/slup129.pdf|title=Magnetic Amplifier Control for Simple, Low-Cost, Secondary Regulation|last=Mammano|first=Bob|date=2001|website=|publisher=Texas Instruments|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have largely fallen out of use due to development in semiconductor amplifiers but are still useful in [[HVDC]] control, and in nuclear power control circuitry due to not being affected by radioactivity.

[[Negative resistance]]s can be used as amplifiers, such as the [[tunnel diode]] amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.tpg.com.au/users/ldbutler/NegativeResistance.htm|title=Negative Resistance Revived|website=users.tpg.com.au|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Munsterman|first=G.T.|date=June 1965|title=Tunnel-Diode Microwave Amplifiers|url=http://techdigest.jhuapl.edu/views/pdfs/V04_N5_1965/V4_N5_1965_Munsterman.pdf|journal=APL Technical Digest|volume=4|pages=2–10|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power amplifiers===
[[File:Sagem VS4 - Skyworks SKY77328-13-9827.jpg|thumb|Power amplifier by [[Skyworks Solutions]] in a [[Smartphone]].]]
A power amplifier is an amplifier designed primarily to increase the power available to a [[Electrical load|load]]. In practice, amplifier power gain depends on the source and load [[Electrical impedance|impedances]], as well as the inherent voltage and current gain. A [[radio frequency]] (RF) amplifier design typically optimizes impedances for power transfer, while audio and instrumentation amplifier designs normally optimize input and output impedance for least loading and highest signal integrity. An amplifier that is said to have a gain of 20&amp;nbsp;dB might have a voltage gain of 20&amp;nbsp;dB and an available power gain of much more than 20&amp;nbsp;dB (power ratio of 100)—yet actually deliver a much lower power gain if, for example, the input is from a 600&amp;nbsp;Ω microphone and the output connects to a 47&amp;nbsp;[[Ohm|kΩ]] input socket for a power amplifier. In general the power amplifier is the last 'amplifier' or actual circuit in a signal chain (the output stage) and is the amplifier stage that requires attention to power efficiency. Efficiency considerations lead to the various classes of power amplifier based on the [[biasing]] of the output transistors or tubes: see [[#Power amplifier classes|power amplifier classes]] below.

[[Audio power amplifier]]s are typically used to drive [[loudspeaker]]s. They will often have [[Stereophonic sound|two output channels]] and deliver equal power to each. An [[RF power amplifier]] is found in radio [[transmitter]] final stages. A [[Servo drive|Servo motor controller]]: amplifies a control voltage to adjust the speed of a motor, or the position of a motorized system.

=== Operational amplifiers (op-amps) ===
[[File:LM741CN.jpg|thumb|An LM741 general purpose [[Operational amplifier|op-amp]]]]
{{Main|Operational amplifier|Instrumentation amplifier}}
An operational amplifier is an amplifier circuit which typically has very high open loop gain and differential inputs. Op amps have become very widely used as standardized "gain blocks" in circuits due to their versatility; their gain, bandwidth and other characteristics can be controlled by [[feedback]] through an external circuit.  Though the term today commonly applies to integrated circuits, the original operational amplifier design used valves, and later designs used discrete transistor circuits.

A [[fully differential amplifier]] is similar to the operational amplifier, but also has differential outputs. These are usually constructed using [[Bipolar junction transistor|BJTs]] or [[Field-effect transistor|FETs]].

=== Distributed amplifiers ===
{{Main|Distributed amplifier}}
These use balanced [[transmission line]]s to separate individual single stage amplifiers, the outputs of which are summed by the same transmission line. The transmission line is a balanced type with the input at one end and on one side only of the balanced transmission line and the output at the opposite end is also the opposite side of the balanced transmission line. The gain of each stage adds linearly to the output rather than multiplies one on the other as in a cascade configuration. This allows a higher bandwidth to be achieved than could otherwise be realised  even with the same gain stage elements.

=== Switched mode amplifiers ===
These nonlinear amplifiers have much higher efficiencies than linear amps, and are used where the power saving justifies the extra complexity. [[Class-D amplifier]]s are the main example of this type of amplification.

=== Applications ===
==== Video amplifiers ====
Video amplifiers are designed to process video signals and have varying bandwidths depending on whether the video signal is for SDTV, EDTV, HDTV 720p or 1080i/p etc.. The specification of the bandwidth itself depends on what kind of filter is used—and at which point ({{nowrap|−1 dB}} or {{nowrap|−3 dB}} for example) the bandwidth is measured. Certain requirements for step response and overshoot are necessary for an acceptable TV image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futureelectronics.com/en/amplifiers/video.aspx|title=What is a video amplifier, video booster amplifiers - Future Electronics|website=www.futureelectronics.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Microwave amplifiers ====
[[Traveling wave tube]] amplifiers (TWTAs) are used for high power amplification at low microwave frequencies. They typically can amplify across a broad spectrum of frequencies; however, they are usually not as tunable as klystrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.r-type.org/articles/art-030.htm|title=Travelling Wave Tube Amplifiers|website=www.r-type.org|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Klystron]]s are specialized linear-beam vacuum-devices, designed to provide high power, widely tunable amplification of millimetre and sub-millimetre waves. Klystrons are designed for large scale operations and despite having a narrower bandwidth than TWTAs, they have the advantage of coherently amplifying a reference signal so its output may be precisely controlled in amplitude, frequency and phase.

Solid-state devices are used such as [[Field effect transistor|GaAs FET]]s, [[IMPATT diode]]s, and others, especially at lower microwave frequencies and power levels on the order of watts.

The [[maser]] is a non-electronic microwave amplifier.

==== Musical instrument amplifiers ====
[[Instrument amplifiers]] are a range of audio power amplifiers used to increase the sound level of musical instruments, for example guitars, during performances.

== Classification of amplifier stages and systems ==
=== Common terminal ===
One set of classifications for amplifiers is based on which device terminal is common to both the input and the output circuit. In the case of [[bipolar junction transistor]]s, the three classes are common emitter, common base, and common collector. For [[field-effect transistor]]s, the corresponding configurations are common source, common gate, and common drain; for [[vacuum tube]]s, common cathode, common grid, and common plate.

The common emitter (or common source, common cathode, etc.) is most often configured to provide amplification of a voltage applied between base and emitter, and the output signal taken between collector and emitter is inverted, relative to the input. The common collector arrangement applies the input voltage between base and collector, and to take the output voltage between emitter and collector. This causes negative feedback, and the output voltage tends to follow the input voltage. This arrangement is also used as the input presents a high impedance and does not load the signal source, though the voltage amplification is less than one. The common-collector circuit is, therefore, better known as an emitter follower, source follower, or cathode follower.

=== Unilateral or bilateral ===
An amplifier whose output exhibits no feedback to its input side is described as 'unilateral'. The input impedance of a unilateral amplifier is independent of load, and output impedance is independent of signal source impedance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedias/active-directivity-of-amplifiers|title=Microwaves101 {{!}} Active Directivity of Amplifiers|last=Administrator|website=www.microwaves101.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An amplifier that uses feedback to connect part of the output back to the input is a ''bilateral'' amplifier. Bilateral amplifier input impedance depends on the load, and output impedance on the signal source impedance.
All amplifiers are bilateral to some degree; however they may often be modeled as unilateral under operating conditions where feedback is small enough to neglect for most purposes, simplifying analysis (see the [[common base]] article for an example).

=== Inverting or non-inverting ===
Another way to classify amplifiers is by the phase relationship of the input signal to the output signal.  An 'inverting' amplifier produces an output 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal (that is, a polarity inversion or mirror image of the input as seen on an [[oscilloscope]]). A 'non-inverting' amplifier maintains the phase of the input signal waveforms. An [[emitter follower]] is a type of non-inverting amplifier, indicating that the signal at the emitter of a transistor is following (that is, matching with unity gain but perhaps an offset) the input signal. Voltage follower is also non inverting type of amplifier having unity gain.

This description can apply to a single stage of an amplifier, or to a complete amplifier system.

=== Function ===
Other amplifiers may be classified by their function or output characteristics. These functional descriptions usually apply to complete amplifier systems or sub-systems and rarely to individual stages.
*A '''[[servo drive|servo amplifier]]''' indicates an integrated [[feedback loop]] to actively control the output at some desired level. A DC [[servomechanism|servo]] indicates use at frequencies down to DC levels, where the rapid fluctuations of an audio or RF signal do not occur. These are often used in mechanical actuators, or devices such as [[DC motor]]s that must maintain a constant speed or [[torque]]. An '''AC servo''' amp. can do this for some AC motors.
*A '''linear''' amplifier responds to different frequency components independently, and does not generate [[harmonic distortion]] or [[intermodulation]] distortion. No amplifier can provide ''perfect'' linearity (even the most linear amplifier has some nonlinearities, since the amplifying devices—[[transistor]]s or [[vacuum tubes]]—follow nonlinear [[power laws]] such as square-laws and rely on circuitry techniques to reduce those effects).
*A '''nonlinear''' amplifier generates significant distortion and so changes the harmonic content; there are situations where this is useful. Amplifier [[non-linear circuits#Non-linear networks|circuits]] intentionally providing a non-linear [[transfer function]] include:
** a device like a [[silicon controlled rectifier]] or a [[transistor#Transistor as a switch|transistor used as a switch]] may be employed to turn either fully ''on'' or ''off'' a load such as a lamp based on a threshold in a continuously variable input.
** a non-linear amplifier in an [[analog computer]] or [[true RMS converter]] for example can provide  a special transfer function, such as logarithmic or square-law.
** a [[Power amplifier classes#Class C|Class C]] [[radio frequency|RF]] amplifier may be chosen because it can be very efficient—but is non-linear. Following such an amplifier with a so-called ''[[LC circuit|tank]]'' [[tuned circuit]] can reduce unwanted harmonics (distortion) sufficiently to make it useful in [[transmitters]], or some desired [[harmonic]] may be selected by setting the [[Electronic filter|resonant frequency]] of the tuned circuit to a higher [[frequency]] rather than [[fundamental frequency]] in [[frequency multiplier]] circuits.
** [[Automatic gain control]] circuits require an amplifier's gain be controlled by the time-averaged amplitude so that the output amplitude varies little when weak stations are being received. The non-linearities are assumed arranged so the relatively small signal amplitude suffers from little distortion (cross-channel interference or [[intermodulation]]) yet is still [[modulated]] by the relatively large gain-control [[direct current|DC]] voltage.
** [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] detector circuits that use amplification such as [[anode-bend detector]]s, [[precision rectifier]]s and [[infinite impedance detector]]s (so excluding ''unamplified'' detectors such as [[cat's-whisker detector]]s), as well as [[Peak detector#Peak detector|peak detector circuits]], rely on changes in amplification based on the [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]]'s instantaneous amplitude to derive a [[direct current]] from an [[alternating current]] input.
** [[Operational amplifier applications#Comparators and detectors|Operational amplifier comparator and detector circuits]].
*A '''wideband''' amplifier has a precise amplification factor over a wide frequency range, and is often used to boost signals for relay in communications systems. A '''narrowband''' amp amplifies a specific narrow range of frequencies, to the exclusion of other frequencies.
*An '''RF''' amplifier amplifies signals in the [[radio frequency]] range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], and is often used to increase the sensitivity of a [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] or the output power of a [[transmitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roy|first=Apratim|author2=Rashid, S.

*An '''audio amplifier''' amplifies [[sound reproduction|audio]] frequencies. This category subdivides into small signal amplification, and power amps that are optimised to driving [[loudspeaker|speaker]]s, sometimes with multiple amps grouped together as separate or bridgeable channels to accommodate different audio reproduction requirements. Frequently used terms within audio amplifiers include:
** [[Preamplifier]] (preamp.), which may include a [[phonograph|phono]] preamp with [[RIAA equalization]], or [[tape head]] preamps with [[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] equalisation filters. They may include [[filter (signal processing)|filter]]s or [[tone control]] circuitry.
** [[Power amplifier]] (normally drives [[loudspeaker]]s), [[headphone]] amplifiers, and [[public address#Amplifiers|public address amplifiers]].
** [[Stereo]] amplifiers imply two channels of output (left and right), though the term simply means "solid" sound (referring to three-dimensional)—so [[quadraphonic]] stereo was used for amplifiers with four channels. 5.1 and 7.1 systems refer to [[Home theatre system]]s with 5 or 7 normal spatial channels, plus a [[subwoofer]] channel.
*[[Buffer amplifiers]], which may include [[emitter follower]]s, provide a high [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] input for a device (perhaps another amplifier, or perhaps an energy-hungry load such as lights) that would otherwise draw too much current from the source. [[Line driver]]s are a type of buffer that feeds long or interference-prone interconnect cables, possibly with [[differential signaling|differential]] outputs through [[twisted pair]] cables.

=== Interstage coupling method ===
{{See also|multistage amplifiers}}
Amplifiers are sometimes classified by the coupling method of the signal at the input, output, or between stages. Different types of these include:
;Resistive-capacitive (RC) coupled amplifier, using a network of resistors and capacitors: By design these amplifiers cannot amplify DC signals as the capacitors block the DC component of the input signal. RC-coupled amplifiers were used very often in circuits with vacuum tubes or discrete transistors. In the days of the integrated circuit a few more transistors on a chip are much cheaper and smaller than a capacitor.
;Inductive-capacitive (LC) coupled amplifier, using a network of inductors and capacitors: This kind of amplifier is most often used in selective radio-frequency circuits.
;[[Transformer]] coupled amplifier, using a transformer to match impedances or to decouple parts of the circuits :Quite often LC-coupled and transformer-coupled amplifiers cannot be distinguished as a transformer is some kind of inductor.
;[[Direct coupled amplifier]], using no impedance and bias matching components: This class of amplifier was very uncommon in the vacuum tube days when the anode (output) voltage was at greater than several hundred volts and the grid (input) voltage at a few volts minus. So they were only used if the gain was specified down to DC (e.g., in an oscilloscope). In the context of modern electronics developers are encouraged to use directly coupled amplifiers whenever possible. In FET and CMOS technologies direct coupling is dominant since gates of MOSFETs theoretically pass no current through themselves. Therefore, DC component of the input signals is automatically filtered.

=== Frequency range ===
Depending on the frequency range and other properties amplifiers are designed according to different principles.

Frequency ranges down to DC are only used when this property is needed. Amplifiers for direct current signals are vulnerable to minor variations in the properties of components with time.  Special methods, such as [[chopper (electronics)|chopper]] stabilized amplifiers are used to prevent objectionable drift in the amplifier's properties for DC. "DC-blocking" [[capacitor]]s can be added to remove DC and sub-sonic frequencies from audio amplifiers.

Depending on the frequency range specified different design principles must be used. Up to the MHz range only "discrete" properties need be considered; e.g., a terminal has an input impedance.

As soon as any connection within the circuit gets longer than perhaps 1% of the wavelength of the highest specified frequency (e.g., at 100&amp;nbsp;MHz the wavelength is 3&amp;nbsp;m, so the critical connection length is approx. 3&amp;nbsp;cm) design properties radically change. For example, a specified length and width of a [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] trace can be used as a selective or impedance-matching entity.
Above a few hundred MHz, it gets difficult to use discrete elements, especially inductors. In most cases, PCB traces of very closely defined shapes are used instead ([[stripline]] techniques).

The frequency range handled by an amplifier might be specified in terms of [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] (normally implying a response that is 3&amp;nbsp;[[Decibel|dB]] down when the frequency reaches the specified bandwidth), or by specifying a '''frequency response''' that is within a certain number of [[decibel]]s between a lower and an upper frequency (e.g. "20&amp;nbsp;Hz to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz plus or minus 1&amp;nbsp;dB").

== Power amplifier classes ==
{{Main|Power amplifier classes}}
Power amplifier circuits (output stages) are classified as A, B, AB and C for [[analog circuit|analog]] designs—and class D and E for switching designs. The [[power amplifier classes]] are based on the proportion of each input cycle (conduction angle) during which an amplifying device passes current.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://electronicdesign.com/analog/understanding-amplifier-operating-classes|title=Understanding Amplifier Operating "Classes"|website=electronicdesign.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image of the conduction angle derives from amplifying a sinusoidal signal. If the device is always on, the conducting angle is 360°. If it is on for only half of each cycle, the angle is 180°. The angle of flow is closely related to the amplifier [[Electrical efficiency|power efficiency]].

== Example amplifier circuit ==
[[File:Amplifier Circuit Small.svg|350px|A practical amplifier circuit|alt=An electronic circuit diagram including resistors, capacitors, transistors and diodes|thumb]]
The practical amplifier circuit to the right could be the basis for a moderate-power audio amplifier. It features a typical (though substantially simplified) design as found in modern amplifiers, with a class-AB [[push–pull output]] stage, and uses some overall negative feedback. Bipolar transistors are shown, but this design would also be realizable with FETs or valves.

The input signal is coupled through [[capacitor]] C1 to the base of transistor Q1. The capacitor allows the [[Alternating current|AC]] signal to pass, but blocks the [[Direct current|DC]] bias voltage established by [[resistor]]s R1 and R2 so that any preceding circuit is not affected by it. Q1 and Q2 form a [[differential amplifier]] (an amplifier that multiplies the difference between two inputs by some constant), in an arrangement known as a [[long-tailed pair]]. This arrangement is used to conveniently allow the use of negative feedback, which is fed from the output to Q2 via R7 and R8.

The negative feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier to compare the input to the actual output. The amplified signal from Q1 is directly fed to the second stage, Q3, which is a [[common emitter]] stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the DC bias for the output stages, Q4 and Q5. R6 provides the load for Q3 (a better design would probably use some form of active load here, such as a constant-current sink). So far, all of the amplifier is operating in class A. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push–pull, also called a complementary pair. They provide the majority of the current amplification (while consuming low quiescent current) and directly drive the load, connected via DC-blocking capacitor C2. The [[diode]]s D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage firmly into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).

This design is simple, but a good basis for a practical design because it automatically stabilises its operating point, since feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond. Further circuit elements would probably be found in a real design that would [[roll-off]] the [[frequency response]] above the needed range to prevent the possibility of unwanted [[oscillation]]. Also, the use of fixed diode bias as shown here can cause problems if the diodes are not both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors{{spaced ndash}} if the output transistors turn on too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage.

A common solution to help stabilise the output devices is to include some emitter resistors, typically one ohm or so. Calculating the values of the circuit's resistors and capacitors is done based on the components employed and the intended use of the amp.

== Notes on implementation ==
Any real amplifier is an imperfect realization of an ideal amplifier. An important limitation of a real amplifier is that the output it generates is ultimately limited by the power available from the power supply. An amplifier saturates and clips the output if the input signal becomes too large for the amplifier to reproduce or exceeds operational limits for the device. The power supply may influence the output, so must be considered in the design. The power output from an amplifier cannot exceed its input power.

The amplifier circuit has an "open loop" performance. This is described by various parameters (gain, [[slew rate]], output [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], [[distortion]], [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[signal-to-noise ratio]], etc.). Many modern amplifiers use [[negative feedback]] techniques to hold the gain at the desired value and reduce distortion. Negative loop feedback has the intended effect of lowering the output impedance and thereby increasing electrical damping of loudspeaker motion at and near the resonance frequency of the speaker.

When assessing rated amplifier power output, it is useful to consider the applied load, the signal type (e.g., speech or music), required power output duration (i.e., short-time or continuous), and required dynamic range (e.g., recorded or live audio). In high-powered audio applications that require long cables to the load (e.g., cinemas and shopping centres) it may be more efficient to connect to the load at line output voltage, with [[Differential signaling|matching transformers]] at source and loads. This avoids long runs of heavy speaker cables.

To prevent instability or overheating requires care to ensure solid state amplifiers are adequately loaded. Most have a rated minimum load impedance.

All amplifiers generate heat through electrical losses. The amplifier must dissipate this heat via [[convection]] or forced air cooling. Heat can damage or reduce electronic component service life. Designers and installers must also consider heating effects on adjacent equipment.

Different power supply types result in many different methods of [[Bias (electrical engineering)|bias]]. Bias is a technique by which active devices are set to operate in a particular region, or by which the DC component of the output signal is set to the midpoint between the maximum voltages available from the power supply. Most amplifiers use several devices at each stage; they are typically matched in specifications except for polarity. Matched inverted polarity devices are called complementary pairs. Class-A amplifiers generally use only one device, unless the power supply is set to provide both positive and negative voltages, in which case a dual device symmetrical design may be used. Class-C amplifiers, by definition, use a single polarity supply.

Amplifiers often have multiple stages in cascade to increase gain. Each stage of these designs may be a different type of amp to suit the needs of that stage. For instance, the first stage might be a class-A stage, feeding a class-AB push–pull second stage, which then drives a class-G final output stage, taking advantage of the strengths of each type, while minimizing their weaknesses.

'''''Ashes of the Singularity''''' is a [[real-time strategy]] [[video game]] developed by [[Oxide Games]] and [[Stardock Entertainment]]. The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on March 31, 2016.

On November 10, 2016, '''''Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation''''' was released. It is a standalone expansion that adds to the base game with more units, maps, and structures, as well as several interface tweaks. The total player count was also increased from 8 to 16 players. The expansion was later merged into the base game on February 16, 2017, after it became apparent that the separate games divided the player community.&lt;ref name="stardock-escalation-merge"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wardell|first1=Brad|authorlink1=Brad Wardell|title=ONE COMMUNITY: Merging the Singularity|url=https://www.stardock.com/community/article/481856/ONE-COMMUNITY-Merging-the-Singularity|publisher=[[Stardock]]|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Ashes of the Singularity'' is a [[real-time strategy]] [[video game]].&lt;ref name="pcgamer_early_access"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/ashes-of-the-singularity-hitting-early-access-next-week/|title=Ashes of the Singularity hitting Early Access next week|last=Sykes|first=Tom|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=October 15, 2015|accessdate=January 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main distinction is its ability to handle thousands of individual units engaging in combat simultaneously, far greater than most other games of its kind, across large maps and without abstraction. This is achieved through a newly developed engine called ''Nitrous'' designed to fully leverage modern [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] [[multi-core processor]]s, reflected in the relatively high system requirements (which include a quad-core processor). To allow players to effectively control such large numbers of units, groups of individual units can be combined into "meta-units" which operate in a cohesive manner, upon which complex strategies can be developed.&lt;ref name="oxide-faq"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Oxide Games|title=''Ashes of the Singularity'' FAQ|url=http://www.ashesofthesingularity.com/game/faq|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''Ashes of the Singularity'' was the first video game released with [[DirectX 12]] support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2015/10/23/stardock-launches-first-ever-directx-12-game/|title=Stardock launches first ever DirectX 12 game|last=Hillier|first=Brenna|work=[[VG247]]|date=October 23, 2015|accessdate=January 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the first to support [[Vulkan (API)|Vulkan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Takahashi |first1=Dean |url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/03/01/how-ashes-of-the-singularity-will-enable-massive-planetary-battles-with-huge-sci-fi-armies/ |title=How Ashes of the Singularity enables massive planetary battles with huge sci-fi armies |date=March 1, 2016 |website=[[GamesBeat]] |publisher=[[VentureBeat]] |accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An in-development version of the game was released commercially via [[Steam Early Access]] on October 22, 2015.&lt;ref name="pcgamer_early_access" /&gt; The full version of the game was released on [[Windows]] on March 31, 2016.&lt;ref name="pcgamer_release_trailer"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcgamer.com/ashes-of-the-singularity-release-date-revealed-in-new-trailer/ | title=Ashes of the Singularity release date revealed in new trailer | work=[[PC Gamer]] | publisher=[[Future plc]] | first=Andy | last=Chalk | date=March 9, 2016 | accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the game's early DirectX 12 support and extensive use of [[Parallel computing|parallel computation]], it is commonly used as a [[benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]. Controversy erupted when Nvidia GPUs were found to perform poorly relative to their AMD counterparts on early beta versions of ''Ashes'';&lt;ref name="pcworld-dx12"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mah Ung|first1=Gordon|title=Windows 10's DirectX 12 graphics performance tested: More CPU cores, more oomph|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2971612/software-games/windows-10s-radical-directx-12-graphics-tech-tested-more-cpu-cores-more-performance.html|website=[[PCWorld]]|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcworld-aots-beta-benchmark"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dingman|first1=Hayden|title=''Ashes of the Singularity'' hits Steam, letting you benchmark DirectX 12 at home|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2996523/software-games/ashes-of-the-singularity-hits-steam-letting-you-benchmark-directx-12-at-home.html|website=[[PCWorld]]|accessdate=24 February 2017|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was due to the game's use of asynchronous compute and shading features which are implemented in hardware on AMD [[Graphics Core Next]] GPUs but had to be performed in software on Nvidia GPUs.&lt;ref name="tomshardware-beta-benchmark"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallossek|first1=Igor|title=''Ashes Of The Singularity'' Beta: Async Compute, Multi-Adapter &amp; Power|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ashes-of-the-singularity-beta-async-compute-multi-adapter-power-consumption,4479.html|website=[[Tom's Hardware]]|accessdate=24 February 2017|date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[molecular biology]], '''biochips''' are essentially miniaturized laboratories that can perform hundreds or thousands of simultaneous biochemical reactions. Biochips enable researchers to quickly screen large numbers of biological analytes for a variety of purposes, from disease diagnosis to detection of [[bioterrorism]] agents. '''Digital microfluidic biochips'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.ee.duke.edu/~krish/a16-su.pdf|title=High-Level Synthesis of Digital Microfluidic Biochips|publisher=Duke University}}&lt;/ref&gt; have become one of the most promising technologies in many biomedical fields. In a digital microfluidic biochip, a group of (adjacent) cells in the microfluidic array can be configured to work as storage, functional operations, as well as for transporting fluid droplets dynamically.

==History==
The development started with early work on the underlying [[sensor]] technology. One of the first portable, chemistry-based sensors was the [[glass electrode|glass pH electrode]], invented in 1922 by Hughes.&lt;ref&gt;W. S. Hughes, "The potential difference between glass and electrolytes in contact with water," ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' 44, pp.&amp;nbsp;2860–2866, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;  In subsequent years. For example, a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor was produced by incorporating [[valinomycin]] into a thin membrane.&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Schultz and R. F. Taylor in ''Handbook of Chemical and Biological Sensors'', J. S. Schultz and R. F. Taylor, eds., ch. Introduction to Chemical and Biological Sensors, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–10, Institute of Physics Publishing, Philadelphia, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]] announced their discovery of the now familiar [[double helix]] structure of [[DNA]] molecules and set the stage for [[genetics]] research that continues to the present day.&lt;ref name=Nelson&gt;D. L. Nelson and M. M. Cox, ''Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry'', Worth Publishers, New York, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[sequencing]] techniques in 1977 by [[Walter Gilbert|Gilbert]]&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Maxam and W. Gilbert, "A new method for sequencing DNA," ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' 74, pp.&amp;nbsp;560–564, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frederick Sanger|Sanger]]&lt;ref&gt;F. Sanger, S. Nicklen, and A. R. Coulson, "DNA sequencing with chainterminating inhibitors," ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' 74, pp.&amp;nbsp;5463–5467, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; (working separately) enabled researchers to directly read the genetic codes that provide instructions for [[protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]]. This research showed how [[hybridisation (molecular biology)|hybridization]] of complementary single [[oligonucleotide]] strands could be used as a basis for DNA sensing. Two additional developments enabled the technology used in modern DNA-based. First, in 1983 [[Kary Mullis]] invented the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technique,&lt;ref name=Nelson/&gt; a method for amplifying DNA concentrations. This discovery made possible the detection of extremely small quantities of DNA in samples. Secondly in 1986 Hood and co-workers devised a method to label DNA molecules with [[fluorescent tag]]s instead of radiolabels,&lt;ref&gt;L. M. Smith, J. Z. Sanders, R. J. Kaiser, P. Hughes, C. Dodd, C. R. Connell, C. Heiner, S. B. H. Kent, and L. E. Hood, "Fluorescence detection in automated DNA sequence analysis," ''Nature'' 321, pp.&amp;nbsp;61–67, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; thus enabling hybridization experiments to be observed optically.

Figure 1 shows the make up of a typical biochip platform. The actual sensing component (or "chip") is just one piece of a complete analysis system. [[Transducer|Transduction]] must be done to translate the actual sensing event (DNA binding, [[redox|oxidation/reduction]], ''etc.'') into a format understandable by a computer ([[voltage]], light intensity, mass, ''etc.''), which then enables additional analysis and processing to produce a final, [[human-readable]] output. The multiple technologies needed to make a successful biochip&amp;mdash;from sensing chemistry, to [[microarray]]ing, to signal processing&amp;mdash;require a true multidisciplinary approach, making the barrier to entry steep. One of the first commercial biochips was introduced by [[Affymetrix]]. Their "GeneChip" products contain thousands of individual DNA sensors for use in sensing defects, or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in genes such as [[p53]] (a tumor suppressor) and [[BRCA1]] and [[BRCA2]] (related to breast cancer).&lt;ref&gt;P. Fortina, D. Graves, C. Stoeckert, Jr., S. McKenzie, and S. Surrey in ''Biochip Technology'', J. Cheng and L. J. Kricka, eds., ch. Technology Options and Applications of DNA Microarrays, pp.&amp;nbsp;185–216, Harwood Academic Publishers, Philadelphia, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The chips are produced using [[microlithography]] techniques traditionally used to fabricate [[integrated circuit]]s (see below).

==Microarray fabrication==
[[File:Sarfus.DNABiochip.jpg|thumb|300px|3D [[Sarfus]] image of a DNA biochip]]
The microarray&amp;mdash;the dense, two-dimensional grid of biosensors&amp;mdash;is the critical component of a biochip platform. Typically, the sensors are deposited on a flat substrate, which may either be passive (''e.g.'' silicon or glass) or active, the latter
consisting of integrated electronics or [[microtechnology|micromechanical]] devices that perform or assist signal transduction. [[Surface chemistry]] is used to [[covalent bond|covalently bind]] the sensor molecules to the substrate medium. The fabrication of microarrays is non-trivial and is a major economic and technological hurdle that may
ultimately decide the success of future biochip platforms. The primary manufacturing challenge is the process of placing each sensor at a specific position (typically on a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] grid) on the substrate. Various means exist to achieve the placement, but typically robotic micro-pipetting&lt;ref&gt;M. Schena, D. Shalon, R. W. Davis, and P. O. Brown, "Quantitative monitoring of gene expression patterns with a complementary DNA microarray," ''Science'' 270, pp.&amp;nbsp;467–470, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; or micro-printing&lt;ref&gt;G. MacBeath, A. N. Koehler, and S. L. Schreiber, "Printing small molecules as microarrays and detecting protein-ligand interactions en masse," ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' 121, pp.&amp;nbsp;7967–7968, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; systems are used to place tiny spots of sensor material on the chip surface. Because each sensor is unique, only a few spots can be placed at a time. The low-throughput nature of this
process results in high manufacturing costs.

Fodor and colleagues developed a unique fabrication process (later used by [[Affymetrix]]) in which a series of microlithography steps is used to [[Combinatorial chemistry|combinatorially synthesize]] hundreds of thousands of unique, single-stranded DNA sensors on a substrate one [[nucleotide]] at a time.&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Fodor, J. L. Read, M. C. Pirrung, L. Stryer, A. T. Lu, and D. Solas, "Light-directed, spatially addressable parallel chemical analysis," ''Science'' 251, pp.&amp;nbsp;767–773, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Pease, D. Solas, E. J. Sullivan, M. T. Cronin, C. P. Holmes, and S. P. Fodor, "Light-generated oligonucleotide arrays for rapid DNA sequence analysis," ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' 91, pp.&amp;nbsp;5022–5026, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  One lithography step is needed per base type; thus, a total of four steps is required per nucleotide level. Although this technique is very powerful in that many sensors can be created simultaneously, it is currently only feasible for creating short DNA strands (15&amp;ndash;25 nucleotides). Reliability and cost factors limit the number of photolithography steps that can be done. Furthermore, light-directed combinatorial synthesis techniques are not currently possible for proteins or other sensing molecules.

As noted above, most microarrays consist of a Cartesian grid of sensors. This approach is used chiefly to map or "encode" the coordinate of each sensor to its function. Sensors in these arrays typically use a universal signalling technique (''e.g.'' fluorescence), thus making coordinates their only identifying feature. These arrays must be made using a serial process (''i.e.'' requiring multiple, sequential steps) to ensure that each sensor is placed at the correct position.

"Random" fabrication, in which the sensors are placed at arbitrary positions on the chip, is an alternative to the serial method. The tedious and expensive positioning process is
not required, enabling the use of parallelized self-assembly techniques. In this approach, large batches of identical sensors can be produced; sensors from each batch are then combined and assembled into an array. A non-coordinate based encoding scheme must be used to identify each sensor. As the figure shows, such a design was first demonstrated (and later commercialized by Illumina) using functionalized beads placed randomly in the wells of an etched [[fiber optic]] cable.&lt;ref&gt;F. J. Steemers, J. A. Ferguson, and D. R. Walt, "Screening unlabeled DNA targets with randomly-ordered fiber-optic gene arrays," ''Nature Biotechnology'' 18, pp.&amp;nbsp;91–94, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. L. Michael, L. C. Taylor, S. L. Schultz, and D. R. Walt, "Randomly ordered addressable high-density optical sensor arrays," ''Analytical Chemistry'' 70, pp.&amp;nbsp;1242–1248, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Each bead was uniquely encoded with a fluorescent signature. However, this encoding scheme is limited in the number of unique dye combinations that can be used and successfully differentiated.

==Protein biochip array and other microarray technologies==
[[Microarray]]s are not limited to [[DNA]] analysis; [[protein microarray]]s, [[antibody microarray]], [[chemical compound microarray]] can also be produced using biochips.  Randox Laboratories Ltd. launched Evidence, the first protein Biochip Array Technology analyzer in 2003.  In protein Biochip Array Technology, the biochip replaces the [[ELISA]] plate or [[cuvette]] as the reaction platform.  The biochip is used to simultaneously analyze a panel of related tests in a single sample, producing a [[patient]] profile.  The patient profile can be used in disease screening, [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], monitoring disease progression or monitoring treatment.  Performing multiple analyses simultaneously, described as multiplexing, allows a significant reduction in processing time and the amount of patient sample required.  Biochip Array Technology is a novel application of a familiar methodology, using sandwich, competitive and antibody-capture [[immunoassay]]s. The difference from conventional immunoassays is that, the capture ligands are covalently attached to the surface of the biochip in an ordered array rather than in solution.

In sandwich assays an enzyme-labelled antibody is used; in competitive assays an enzyme-labelled antigen is used.  On antibody-antigen binding a [[chemiluminescence]] reaction produces light.  Detection is by a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) camera.  The CCD camera is a sensitive and high-resolution sensor able to accurately detect and quantify very low levels of light.  The test regions are located using a grid pattern then the chemiluminescence signals are analysed by imaging software to rapidly and simultaneously quantify the individual analytes.

Biochips are also used in the field of [[microphysiometry]] e.g. in skin-on-a-chip&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, F., Eggert, S., Wiest, J.: Skin-on-a-chip: Transepithelial electrical resistance and extracellular acidification measurements through an automated air-liquid interface, Genes, 2018, 9/2, 114; doi:10.3390/genes9020114&lt;/ref&gt; applications.

[[File:CSR 01.jpg|thumb|Right|Stornophone 6000 Cab Secure Radio]]'''Cab Secure Radio''' (CSR) was an in-cab [[analog transmission|analogue]] [[radiotelephone]] system formerly used on parts of the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|British railway network]]. Its main function was to provide a [[secure communication|secure]] [[speech]] link between the [[Railroad engineer|train driver]] and the [[Signalman (rail)|signaller]] which could not be overheard by other train drivers. In areas where CSR was used it had to be the primary method of communication between driver and signaller, always being used in preference to the ''signal post telephone''. CSR was replaced by the [[GSM-R]] [[Digital data|digital]] system, forming the initial phase of rollout of [[European Rail Traffic Management System|ERTMS]] throughout the [[UK]].

== History ==
CSR was first introduced in the [[Glasgow]] area in 1986 to enable driver-only operation of trains. It was later used in the [[London]] and [[Liverpool]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;In the Railway rule book there is provision for a driver stopped at a red signal to disembark the train and access a track-side telephone in order to talk to the signalman. This might be occasioned by a scenario where there was a track circuit failure and the signals had reverted to the safe condition. The rule book however also requires the train to be continuously manned during normal running operations. CSR was first introduced to allow the driver to talk to the signalman without leaving the train. The safety features associated with CSR whereby a signalman can send an alarm to a train or order a train to stop using a single data transmission service later secured CSR as a safety facility that could be deployed on a more universal basis. However it wasn't until the Clapham Rail disaster and subsequent Hidden report also followed by the accident at Cowden where the real value of the facility was learned.

== Use ==
[[File:Northern Line (Merseyrail) tunnel south from Liverpool Central.jpg|thumb|right|Marker board for the start of CSR area 39 on Merseyrail]]The driver initialised the CSR with an area code followed by the identification number of the signal in front of the train. The radio then automatically sent the [[British Rail locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification#1973 numbering and classification - TOPS|stock number]] of the train (e.g., 455112), to the signalling system. The signaller then allocated a [[train reporting number]] (e.g., 2M34) to the train. This reporting number was used by the signalling equipment to track the progress of the train as it moves through the rail network.

Each signalling area (or signal panel within a larger signalbox) used a different radio channel corresponding with an area code. As the train passed from the jurisdiction of one signaller to another, the CSR in the driver's cab changed channel automatically. Lineside signs were provided to inform the driver of where the area code changes. Occasionally the radio failed to change channel or lost the signal completely, in which case the driver could enter the code manually. Lineside signs indicated the change of the CSR radio channel area.

== Hardware ==
CSR cab equipment was either the Stornophone 6000 or a [[Siemens]] model.&lt;ref&gt;

{{anchor|decoherer}}&lt;!-- parked here for now --&gt;
The '''coherer''' was a primitive form of radio signal [[Detector (radio)|detector]] used in the first [[radio receiver]]s during the [[wireless telegraphy]] era at the beginning of the 20th century. Its use in radio was based on the 1890 findings of French physicist [[Edouard Branly]] and adapted by other physicists and inventors over the next ten years. The device consists of a tube or capsule containing two [[electrode]]s spaced a small distance apart with loose [[metal filings]] in the space between. When a [[radio frequency]] signal is applied to the device, the metal particles would cling together or "[[wiktionary:cohere|cohere]]", reducing the initial high [[resistance (electricity)|resistance]] of the device, thereby allowing a much greater direct current to flow through it. In a receiver, the current would activate a bell, or a Morse paper tape recorder to make a record of the received signal. The metal filings in the coherer remained conductive after the signal (pulse) ended so that the coherer had to be "decohered" by tapping it with a clapper actuated by an electromagnet, each time a signal was received, thereby restoring the coherer to its original state. Coherers remained in widespread use until about 1907, when they were replaced by more sensitive [[Electrolytic detector|electrolytic]] and [[crystal detector]]s.

==History==
The behavior of particles or metal filings in the presence of electricity or electric sparks was noticed in many experiments well before Edouard Branly's 1890 paper and even before there was proof of the theory of [[electromagnetism]].&lt;ref&gt;L. W. Turner, Electronics Engineer's Reference Book, Butterworth-Heinemann - 2013, pages 2-3, 2-4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1835 Swedish scientist [[Peter Samuel Munk]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter Samuel Munk af Rosenschold lecture assistant in Chemistry at the University of Lund was born at Lund in 1804 and died in 1860 (Michael Faraday, Christian Friedirich Schoenbein, The letters of Faraday and Schoenbein 1836-1862: With notes, comments and references to contemporary letters, Williams &amp; Norgate - 1899, page 54)&lt;/ref&gt; noticed a change of resistance in a mixture of metal filings in the presence of spark discharge from a Leyden jar.&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0407773.pdf Eric Falcon and Bernard Castaing, Electrical conductivity in granular media and Branly’s coherer: A simple experiment, page 1]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850 [[Pierre Guitard]] found that when dusty air was electrified, the particles would tend to collect in the form of strings. The idea that particles could react to electricity was used in English engineer [[Samuel Alfred Varley]]'s 1866 [[lightning bridge]], a [[lightning arrester]] attached to telegraph lines consisting of a piece of wood with two metal spikes extending into a chamber. The space was filled with powdered carbon that would not allow the low voltage telegraph signals to pass through but it would conduct and ground a high voltage lightning strike.&lt;ref name="K. Sarkar, Robert Mailloux 2006, pages 261-262"&gt;T. K. Sarkar, Robert Mailloux, Arthur A. Oliner, M. Salazar-Palma, Dipak L. Sengupta, History of Wireless, John Wiley &amp; Sons - 2006, pages 261-262&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879 the Welsh scientist [[David Edward Hughes]] found that loose contacts between a carbon rod and two carbon blocks as well as the metallic granules in a microphone he was developing responded to sparks generated in a nearby apparatus.&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"/&gt; [[Temistocle Calzecchi-Onesti]] in Italy began studying the anomalous change in the resistance of thin metallic films and metal particles at [[Fermo]]/[[Monterubbiano]]. He found that copper filings between two brass plates would cling together, becoming conductive, when he applied a voltage to them. He also found that other types of metal filings would have the same reaction to electric sparks occurring at a distance, a phenomenon that he thought could be used for detecting lightning strikes.&lt;ref name="K. Sarkar, Robert Mailloux 2006, pages 261-262"/&gt; Calzecchi-Onesti's papers were published in il Nuovo Cimento in 1884, 1885 and 1886.

[[Image:Branly coherer.png|thumb|upright=0.7|Branly's electrical circuit tube filled with [[iron filings]] (later called a "coherer")]]

In 1890, French physicist Edouard Branly published ''On the Changes in Resistance of Bodies under Different Electrical Conditions'' in a French Journal where he described his thorough investigation of the effect of minute electrical charges on metal and many types of metal filings. In one type of circuit, filings were placed in a tube of glass or ebonite, held between two metal plates. When an electric discharge was produced in the neighbourhood of the circuit, a large deviation was seen on the attached [[galvanometer]] needle. He noted the filings in the tube would react to the electric discharge even when the tube was placed in another room 20 yards away.  Branly went on to devise many types of these devices based on "imperfect" metal contacts.  Branly's filings tube came to light in 1892 in Great Britain when it was described by Dr. Dawson Turner at a meeting of the British Association in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="Sungook Hong page 4"&gt;Sungook Hong, Wireless: From Marconi's Black-box to the Audion, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n3c3AQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=onesti%20coherer&amp;pg=PA268#v=onepage&amp;q=onesti%20coherer&amp;f=false E C Green, The Development of the Coherer And Some Theories of Coherer Action,  Scientific American: Supplement, Volume 84 - 1917, page 268]&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish electrical engineer and astronomer [[George Forbes (scientist)|George Forbes]] suggested that Branly's filings tube might be reacting in the presence of Hertzian waves, a type of air-borne [[electromagnetic radiation]] proven to exist by German physicist [[Heinrich Hertz]] (later called [[radio waves]]).

[[Image:Marconi's Coherer Receiver at Oxford Museum History of Science (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|Marconi's 1896 coherer receiver, at the Oxford [[Museum of the History of Science]], UK.  The coherer is on right, with the decoherer mechanism behind it. The relay is in the cylindrical metal container ''(center)'' to shield the coherer from the RF noise from its contacts.]]

In 1893 physicist W.B. Croft exhibited Branly's experiments at a meeting of the Physical Society in London. It was unclear to Croft and others whether the filings in the Branly tube were reacting to sparks or the light from the sparks. George Minchin noticed the Branly tube might be reacting to Hertzian waves the same way his solar cell did and wrote the paper "''The Action of Electromagnetic Radiation on Films containing Metallic Powders''".&lt;ref name="Sungook Hong page 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; These papers were read by English physicist [[Oliver Lodge]] who saw this as a way to build a much improved Hertzian wave detector. On 1 June 1894, a few months after the death of Heinrich Hertz, Oliver Lodge delivered a memorial lecture on Hertz where he demonstrated the properties of "Hertzian waves" (radio), including transmitting them over a short distance, using an improved version of Branly's filings tube, which Lodge had named the "coherer", as a detector. In May 1895, after reading about Lodge's demonstrations, the Russian physicist [[Alexander Popov (physicist)|Alexander Popov]] built a "Hertzian wave" (radio wave) based lightning detector using a coherer. That same year, Italian inventor [[Guglielmo Marconi]] demonstrated a wireless telegraphy system using Hertzian waves (radio), based on a coherer.

The coherer was replaced in receivers by the simpler and more sensitive [[Electrolytic detector|electrolytic]] and [[crystal detector]]s around 1907, and became obsolete.

One minor use of the coherer in modern times was by Japanese tin-plate toy manufacturer Matsudaya Toy Co. who beginning 1957 used a [[spark-gap transmitter]] and coherer-based receiver in a range of radio-controlled (RC) toys, called Radicon (abbreviation for Radio-Controlled) toys. Several different types using the same RC system were commercially sold, including a Radicon Boat (very rare), Radicon Oldsmobile Car (rare) and a Radicon Bus (the most popular).&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite book

==Operation==
[[Image:Recepteur tube limaille.JPG|right|thumb|The circuit of a coherer receiver, that recorded the received code on a Morse paper tape recorder.]]
Unlike modern AM radio stations that transmit a continuous radio frequency, whose amplitude (power) is [[modulation|modulated]] by an [[Sound|audio]] signal, the first [[radio transmitter]]s transmitted information by [[wireless telegraphy]] ([[radiotelegraphy]]), the transmitter was turned on and off ([[on-off keying]]) to produce different length pulses of unmodulated [[carrier wave]] signal, "dots" and "dashes", that spelled out text messages in [[Morse code]]. As a result, early radio receiving apparatus merely had to detect the presence or absence of the radio signal, not convert it to audio.  The device that did this was called a [[detector (radio)|detector]].  The coherer was the most successful of many detector devices that were tried in the early days of radio.

The basis for the operation of the coherer is that metal particles [[wiktionary:cohere|cohere]] (cling together) and conduct electricity much better after being subjected to [[radio frequency]] electricity. The radio signal from the antenna was applied directly across the coherer's electrodes. When the radio signal from a "dot" or "dash" came in, the coherer would become conductive. The coherer's electrodes were also attached to a [[direct current|DC]] circuit powered by a battery that created a "click" sound in earphones or a [[telegraph sounder]], or a mark on a paper tape, to record the signal. Unfortunately, the reduction in the coherer's [[electrical resistance]] persisted after the radio signal was removed. This was a problem because the coherer had to be ready immediately to receive the next "dot" or "dash". Therefore, a '''decoherer''' mechanism was added to tap the coherer, mechanically disturbing the particles to reset it to the high resistance state.

Coherence of particles by radio waves is an obscure phenomenon that is not well understood even today.  Recent experiments with particle coherers seem to have confirmed the hypothesis that the particles cohere by a micro-weld phenomenon caused by [[Radio Frequency|radio frequency]] electricity flowing across the small contact area between particles.&lt;ref&gt;E.

}}

The coherer used in practical receivers was a glass tube, sometimes [[Vacuum|evacuated]], which was about half filled with sharply cut metal filings, often part [[silver]] and part [[nickel]]. Silver [[electrode]]s made contact with the metal particles on both ends. In some coherers, the electrodes were slanted so the width of the gap occupied by the filings could be varied by rotating the tube about its long axis, thus adjusting its sensitivity to the prevailing conditions.

In operation, the coherer is included in two separate electrical circuits. One is the antenna-ground circuit shown in the untuned receiver circuit diagram below.  The other is the battery-sounder relay circuit including battery ''B1'' and relay ''R'' in the diagram.  A radio signal from the antenna-ground circuit "turns on" the coherer, enabling current flow in the battery-sounder circuit, activating the sounder, ''S''.  The coils, ''L'', act as RF [[Choke (electronics)|chokes]] to prevent the RF signal power from leaking away through the relay circuit.

[[Image:Coherer Rcvr.jpg|left|thumb|A radio receiver circuit using a coherer detector ''(C)''. The "tapper" (decoherer) is not shown.]]

One electrode, ''A'', of the coherer, (''C'', in the left diagram) is connected to the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] and the other electrode, ''B'', to [[Ground (electricity)|ground]]. A series combination of a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]], ''B1'', and a relay, ''R'', is also attached to the two electrodes. When the signal from a [[spark gap transmitter]] is received, the filings tend to cling to each other, reducing the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the coherer. When the coherer conducts better, battery ''B1'' supplies enough current through the coherer to activate relay ''R'', which connects battery ''B2'' to the [[telegraph sounder]] ''S'', giving an audible click.  In some applications, a pair of headphones replaced the telegraph sounder, being much more sensitive to weak signals, or a Morse recorder which recorded the dots and dashes of the signal on paper tape.

[[Image:Blondel coherer and Guarini decoherer.jpg|thumb|A coherer with electromagnet-operated "tapper" (decoherer), built by early radio researcher Emile Guarini around 1904.]]

The problem of the filings continuing to cling together and conduct after the removal of the signal was solved by tapping or shaking the coherer  after the arrival of each signal, shaking the filings and raising the resistance of the coherer to the original value.  This apparatus was called a '''decoherer'''.    This process was referred to as 'decohering' the device and was subject to much innovation during the life of the popular use of this component. [[Nikola Tesla|Tesla]], for example, invented a coherer in which the tube rotated continually along its axis.

In later practical receivers the decoherer was a clapper similar to an electric bell, operated by an [[electromagnet]] powered by the coherer current itself.  When the radio wave turned on the coherer, the DC current from the battery flowed through the electromagnet, pulling the arm over to give the coherer a tap.  This returned the coherer to the nonconductive state, turning off the electromagnet current, and the arm sprang back.  If the radio signal was still present, the coherer would immediately turn on again, pulling the clapper over to give it another tap, which would turn it off again.  The result was a constant "trembling" of the clapper during the period that the radio signal was on, during the "dots" and "dashes" of the Morse code signal.

==Imperfect junction coherer==
There are several variations of what is known as the imperfect junction coherer.  The principle of operation (microwelding) suggested above for the filings coherer may be less likely to apply to this type because there is no need for decohering.  An iron and mercury variation on this device was used by Marconi for the first transatlantic radio message.  An earlier form was invented by [[Jagdish Chandra Bose]] in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/varun_ag/www/bose_real_inventor.pdf Bose article by Varun Aggarwal]&lt;/ref&gt; The device consisted of a small metallic cup containing a pool of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] covered by a very thin [[Electrical insulation|insulating]] film of [[oil]]; above the surface of the oil, a small [[iron]] disc is suspended. By means of an adjusting screw the lower edge of the disc is made to touch the oil-covered mercury with a pressure small enough not to puncture the film of oil. Its principle of operation is not well understood.  The action of detection occurs when the radio frequency signal somehow breaks down the insulating film of oil, allowing the device to conduct, operating the receiving sounder wired in series. This form of coherer is self-restoring and needs no decohering.

In 1899, Bose announced the development of an "''iron-mercury-iron coherer with [[telephone]] detector''" in a paper presented at the [[Royal Society]], London.&lt;ref&gt;Bondyopadhyay (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; He also later received {{US patent|755840}}, "''Detector for electrical disturbances''" (1904), for a specific [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] receiver.

Coherers were also finicky to adjust and not very sensitive.  Another problem was that, because of the cumbersome mechanical "decohering" mechanism, the coherer was limited to a receiving speed of 12 - 15 words per minute of Morse code, while telegraph operators could send at rates of 50 WPM, and paper tape machines at 100 WPM.&lt;ref name="Maver"&gt;{{cite journal

More important for the future, the coherer could not detect [[amplitude modulation|AM]] (radio) transmissions. As a simple switch that registered the presence or absence of radio waves, the coherer could detect the [[on-off keying]] of [[wireless telegraphy]] transmitters, but it could not [[demodulation|demodulate]] ([[rectifier|rectify]]) the waveforms of [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[radiotelephone]] signals, which began to be experimented with in the first years of the 20th century. This problem was solved by the rectification capability of [[Reginald Fessenden]]'s [[hot wire barretter]] and [[electrolytic detector]]. These were replaced by the [[crystal detector]] around 1906, and then around 1912 by [[vacuum tube]] technologies such as [[John Ambrose Fleming]]'s [[thermionic diode]] and [[Lee De Forest]]'s [[Audion]] ([[triode]]) tube.

In [[computer science]], '''contextualization''' is the process of identifying the data relevant to an entity (e.g., a person or a city) based on the entity's contextual information.&lt;ref name="IoTContextualisation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contextualised service delivery in the Internet of Things: Parking recommender for smart cities|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7845479|website=ieeexplore|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Context or contextual information is any information about any entity that can be used to effectively reduce the amount of reasoning required (via filtering, aggregation, and inference) for decision making within the scope of a specific application.&lt;ref name="ConTaaS"&gt;{{cite web|title=ConTaaS: An Approach to Internet-Scale Contextualisation for Developing Efficient Internet of Things Applications|url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/41879|website=ScholarSpace|publisher=HICSS50|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contextualisation is then the process of identifying the data relevant to an entity based on the entity's contextual information. Contextualisation excludes irrelevant data from consideration and has the potential to reduce data from several aspects including volume, velocity, and variety in large-scale data intensive applications (Yavari et al.).&lt;ref name="ConTaaS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IoTContextualisation"/&gt;

==Usage==
Data Processing, Contextualisation has the potential to reduce the amount of data based on the interests from applications/services/users. 
Contextualisation can improve the scalability and efficiency of data process, query, delivery by excluding irrelevant data. As an example, ConTaaS facilitates contextualisation of the data for IoT applications and could improve the processing for large-scale IoT applications from various [[Big Data]] aspects including volume, velocity, and variety.

==Example domains==
* [[Object-oriented programming]]: Contextualization consists, at [[Object (computer science)|object]] creation time, to provide adequate [[Initialization (programming)|initialization]] parameters to a [[Class (computer programming)|class]] [[Constructor (object-oriented programming)|constructor]].
* [[Virtualization]]: Contextualization permits, at the end of [[Virtual machine|VM]] instantiation, to set or override VM data having unknown or default values at the time of creation of the [[Live CD]], typically hostname, IP address, .ssh/authorized_keys, ...

Madigan, M. T., Martinko, J. M., Stahl, D. A., &amp; Clark, D. P. (2012). Brock Biology of Microorganisms (13 ed.). San Francisco: Pearson Education Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; However ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'' uses polychlorinated [[aliphatic]] alkanes as the electron acceptor.&lt;ref name="moe" /&gt; [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|Chloroflexi]] are the deepest branching (oldest) anoxygenic [[phototrophs]] on the [[tree of life]].&lt;ref name="brock" /&gt;

Many of the species in [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|Chloroflexi]] are [[thermophilic]] however ''[[Dehalogenimonas]]'' ''lykanthroporepellens'' is a mesophile.&lt;ref name="brock" /&gt; The ''Oscillochloris'' (Class [[Chloroflexi (class)|Chloroflexi]]) are also [[mesophilic]].&lt;ref name="brock" /&gt; Despite this relationship, ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'' is more closely related to the ''[[Dehalococcoides]]'' (class [[Dehalococcoidetes|Dehalococcoidia]]) with 90% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity.&lt;ref name="moe" /&gt; ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'' also differ from other species in the phylum [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|Chloroflexi]] in that they are not [[wikt:filament|filamentous]].&lt;ref name="brock" /&gt;

== Metabolism ==

''[[Dehalogenimonas]]'' ''lykanthroporepellens'' is a [[chemotroph]]ic organism that uses H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an [[electron donor]] and polychlorinated [[aliphatic]] alkanes as an [[electron acceptor]].&lt;ref name="sid" /&gt; These molecules include [[1,2,3-trichloropropane]], [[1,2-dichloropropane]], [[1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane]], [[1,1,2-trichloroethane]], and [[1,2-dichloroethane]].&lt;ref name="sid" /&gt; However, there are several chlorinated alkanes that it cannot reduce, such as [[1-chloropropane]] and [[2-chloropropane]].&lt;ref name="sid" /&gt; It uses these compounds as [[electron acceptors]] in dihaloelimination reactions.&lt;ref name="sid" /&gt; In dihaloelimination the electron donor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in this case) is used to remove two [[halogens]] from adjacent carbons that are double bonded. [[1,2,3-trichloropropane]] is reduced to [[allyl chloride]] by ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'', and further transformed abiotically to [[allyl alcohol]] in the presence of water (other abiotic reactions can occur).&lt;ref name="moe" /&gt; The carbon source has not been determined for this species but other organisms within [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|Chloroflexi]] use CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a carbon source.&lt;ref name="brock" /&gt;

== Genome ==

Although two strains of ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'' have been isolated and characterized, only the type strain BL-DC-9&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; has had the genome sequenced.  Therefore, when referring to ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'' in this section, all information is only verified for BL-DC-9&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;. ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'' has a circular [[chromosome]] consisting of 1,686,510 bp and a [[G-C content]], based on genomic analysis, of 55.04%.&lt;ref name="sid"/&gt; The [[genome]] was [[sequenced]] using both [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] and [[454 Life Sciences|454]] sequencing platforms, more specifically an [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] shotgun library, a [[454 Life Sciences|454]] draft library, and a paired end [[454 Life Sciences|454]] library.&lt;ref name="sid"/&gt; [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] sequence data was assembled and combined with assembled [[454 Life Sciences|454]] data.&lt;ref name="sid"/&gt; Initial [[sequence assembly|assembly]] contained 64 [[contig]]s (a set of overlapping [[DNA]]) in 1 scaffold (a set of overlapping [[contig]]s with known gap lengths).&lt;ref name="sid"/&gt; [[Gene]]s were annotated using a combination of automated and manual curation.&lt;ref name="sid"/&gt; 1,771 [[gene]]s were predicted, in which 1,720 were protein-coding [[gene]]s and 51 were RNAs.&lt;ref name="sid"/&gt; Putative function was designated to nearly 70% of the protein-coding genes.&lt;ref name="sid"/&gt;

Interest in ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'' stems from its ability to degrade polychlorinated [[aliphatic]] alkanes into nonhazardous products.&lt;ref name="moe"/&gt; The catalysis of reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated compounds is dependent on the presence and expression of genes coding for reductive [[dehalogenase]] enzymes.&lt;ref name="Neumann"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neumann | first1 = A. | last2 = Wohlfarth | first2 = G. | last3 = Diekert | first3 = G. | year = 1998 | title = Tetrachloroethene dehalogenase from ''Dehalospirillum'' ''multivorans'': cloning, sequencing of the encoding genes, and expression of the pceA gene in ''Escherichia'' ''coli'' | url = http://jb.asm.org/content/180/16/4140.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = J Bacteriol | volume = 180 | issue = | pages = 4140–4145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adrian"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adrian | first1 = L. | last2 = Rahnenfuhrer | first2 = J. | last3 = Gobom | first3 = J. | last4 = Holscher | first4 = T. | year = 2007 | title = Identification of a chlorobenzene reductive dehalogenase in ''Dehalococcoides'' sp. strain CBDB1 | url = http://aem.asm.org/content/73/23/7717.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Appl Environ Microbiol | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 7717–7724 | doi=10.1128/aem.01649-07| pmc = 2168065 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fung"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fung | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Morris | first2 = R.M. | last3 = Adrian | first3 = L. | last4 = Zinder | first4 = S.H. | year = 2007 | title = Expression of reductive dehalogenase genes in ''Dehalococcoides'' ''ethenogenes'' strain 195 growing on tetrachloroethene, trichloroethene, or 2,3-dichlorophenol | url = http://aem.asm.org/content/73/14/4439.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Appl Environ Microbiol | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 4439–4445 | doi=10.1128/aem.00215-07| pmc = 1932842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[gene]]s are organized in ''rdhAB'' operons, which encode the RdhA protein (reductive [[dehalogenase]]) and the RdhB protein (membrane anchor).&lt;ref name="sid"/&gt; ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'' was shown to have several ''rdhA'' and ''rdhB'' [[gene]]s in the [[chromosome]].&lt;ref name="sid"/&gt;

Furthermore, ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'' has a [[prophage]] region containing 45 hypothetic proteins, which accounts for roughly 4% of the chromosome.&lt;ref name="sid"/&gt; An additional ~4.3% of the genome of ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'' is made up of [[insertion sequence]] elements, which encode for 74 full or truncated [[transposase]]s.&lt;ref name="sid"/&gt; Thus, [[horizontal gene transfer]] appears to be a potential mechanism for the adaptation of ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'' to its [[ecological niche]].&lt;ref name="sid"/&gt;

== Application in Bioremediation ==

Polychlorinated [[aliphatic]] C2 and C3 alkanes (ethanes and propanes with at least two chlorine substituents) are industrially important [[chemical intermediate]]s globally produced on a massive scale.&lt;ref name="DeWildeman"&gt;DeWildeman S., Verstraete W. "The quest for microbial reductive dechlorination of C2 to C4 chloroalkanes is warranted". Appl. Microbiol. Biotech. 2003; 61:94–102 http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/914/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00253-002-1174-6.pdf?auth66=1399062499_97567e71de984eaad3426e8bb77bdd35&amp;ext=.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Due to spills and past inappropriate disposal methods, these chlorinated compounds are prevalent groundwater and soil contaminants throughout the US and around the world.&lt;ref name="DeWildeman"/&gt; [[Bioremediation]] approaches that rely on the action of [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]], reductively-dehalogenating bacteria, such as ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'', have shown great promise for clean-up of chlorinated solvent-contaminated soil and [[groundwater]].&lt;ref name="yan1"/&gt; Using [[qPCR]] (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction), 16S rRNA gene sequences for ''Dehalogenimonas'' strains have been found to be at concentrations as high as 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; copies/ml of groundwater contaminated with high concentrations of chlorinated solvents and comprise up to nearly 19% of the total bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies.&lt;ref name="yan2"/&gt; 
 
The characterization of ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'' has aided in remediation plans through better understanding of the overall process of reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated compounds present in groundwater and the diversity of organisms involved.&lt;ref name="yan2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yan | first1 = J | last2 = Rash | first2 = BA | last3 = Rainey | first3 = FA | last4 = Moe | first4 = WM | year = 2009 | title = Detection and quantification of ''Dehalogenimonas'' and "Dehalococcoides" populations via PCR-based protocols targeting 16S rRNA genes | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2786429/pdf/1938-09.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Appl.

''lykanthroporepellens'' was found to be  amplified by primers that at one time were believed to be specific to targeting ''Dehalococcoides'' spp.&lt;ref name="yan2"/&gt;  Differentiation between the presence of ''Dehalococcoides'' spp. and ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'' is important for remediation planning because ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'' dehalogenates polychlorinated alkanes, but is unable to dehalogenate chlorinated ethenes like ''[[Dehalococcoides]]'' spp.&lt;ref name="yan2"/&gt; Furthermore, ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'' was the first [[pure culture]] isolated which could dehalogenate 1,2,3-trichloropropane (1,2,3-TCP) under anaerobic conditions.&lt;ref name="yan1" /&gt; ''D''. ''lykanthroporepellens'' has also been shown to dehalogenate [[1,2-dichloroethane]] (1,2-DCA), [[1,2-dichloropropane]] (1,2-DCP), and [[1,1,2-trichloroethane]] (1,1,2-TCA) present in mixtures and at concentrations as high as 8.7, 4.0, and 3.8 mM respectively.&lt;ref name="Dillehay"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dillehay |first1=JL |last2=Bowman |first2=KS |last3=Yun |first3=J |last4=Rainey |first4=FA |last5=Moe |first5=WM |year=2013 |title=Substrate interactions in dehalogenation of 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichloropropane, and 1,1,2-trichloroethane mixtures by ''Dehalogenimonas'' spp |doi=10.1007/s10532-013-9661-2 |journal=Biodegradation |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=301–312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maness"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maness | first1 = A.D. | last2 = Bowmann | first2 = K.S. | last3 = Yan | first3 = J. | last4 = Rainey | first4 = F.A. | last5 = Moe | first5 = W.M. | year = 2012 | title = ''Dehalogenimonas'' spp. can reductively dehalogenate high concentrations of 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichloropropane, and 1,1,2-trichloroethane | url = http://www.amb-express.com/content/pdf/2191-0855-2-54.pdf | format = PDF | journal = AMB Express | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 54–60 | doi=10.1186/2191-0855-2-54}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings are important because a large number of contaminated sites contain mixtures of various chlorinated solvents and/or high concentrations.&lt;ref name="Dillehay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="maness" /&gt;

[[File:Prax ME 4.jpg|thumbnail|Drum pumps on barrels]]
'''Drum pump''' refers to [[pump]]s that are used to empty [[barrel]]s, [[tanks]], [[Intermediate bulk container|IBCs]] and [[Drum (container)|drums]]. Many liquids used on manufacturing and processing plants are delivered in 100 or 200 litre barrels and are too heavy to tip to empty the liquids inside. Drum pumps consist of a vertical shaft inside a narrow tube which fits inside the drum opening.  The pump motor is attached to the vertical shaft at the top of the tube outside and above the drum and the pumping element is located at the end of the shaft inside the drum.  This configuration allows the drum to be emptied without tipping and so reduces the risk of spills and operator injury.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Primary uses of drum pump are in 55 gallon barrels but they are also used in 5, 15, 30, 55, 275 and 330 gallon containers. Drum pumps come in many forms from simple rotary style to a variety of other styles like lever, [[siphon]], double diaphragm, electric, air, piston, etc.

Also referred to as Container Pumps, Barrel Pumps and Tote Pumps.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22562">An '''enzymatic biofuel cell''' is a specific type of [[fuel cell]] that uses [[enzymes]] as a [[catalyst]] to [[oxidize]] its fuel, rather than precious metals. Enzymatic [[biofuel]] cells, while currently confined to research facilities, are widely prized for the promise they hold in terms of their relatively inexpensive components and fuels, as well as a potential power source for [[bionic]] implants.

==Operation==
[[Image:General Enzyme Fuel Cell Diagram.png|thumb|A general diagram for an enzymatic biofuel cell using [[Glucose]] and [[Oxygen]]. The blue area indicates the [[electrolyte]].]]
	Enzymatic biofuel cells work on the same general principles as all fuel cells: use a catalyst to separate electrons from a parent molecule and force it to go around an electrolyte barrier through a wire to generate an electric current. What makes the enzymatic biofuel cell distinct from more conventional fuel cells are the catalysts they use and the fuels that they accept. Whereas most fuel cells use metals like [[platinum]] and [[nickel]] as catalysts, the enzymatic biofuel cell uses enzymes derived from living cells (although not within living cells; fuel cells that use whole cells to catalyze fuel are called [[microbial fuel cells]]). This offers a couple of advantages for enzymatic biofuel cells: Enzymes are relatively easy to mass-produce and so benefit from [[economies of scale]], whereas precious metals must be mined and so have an [[inelastic supply]]. Enzymes are also specifically designed to process organic compounds such as sugars and alcohols, which are extremely common in nature. Most organic compounds cannot be used as fuel by fuel cells with metal catalysts because the carbon monoxide formed by the interaction of the carbon molecules with oxygen during the fuel cell’s functioning will quickly “poison” the precious metals that the cell relies on, rendering it useless.&lt;ref name=Atan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atanassov|first=Plamen|title=Enzymatic Biofuel Cells|journal=The Electrochemical Society Interface|year=2007|volume=16|issue=2|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because sugars and other biofuels can be grown and harvested on a massive scale, the fuel for enzymatic biofuel cells is extremely cheap and can be found in nearly any part of the world, thus making it an extraordinarily attractive option from a logistics standpoint, and even more so for those concerned with the adoption of [[renewable energy sources]].

Enzymatic biofuel cells also have operating requirements not shared by traditional fuel cells. What is most significant is that the enzymes that allow the fuel cell to operate must be “immobilized” near the anode and cathode in order to work properly; if not immobilized, the enzymes will diffuse into the cell’s fuel and most of the liberated electrons will not reach the electrodes, compromising its effectiveness.&lt;ref name=Moe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moehlenbrock|first=Michael J.|author2=Shelley D. Minteer|title=Extended Lifetime Biofuel Cells|journal=Chemical Society Reviews|year=2008|volume=37|issue=6|doi= 10.1039/b708013c|pages=1188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with immobilization, a means must also be provided for electrons to be transferred to and from the [[electrode]]s. This can be done either directly from the enzyme to the electrode (“direct electron transfer”) or with the aid of other chemicals that transfer electrons from the enzyme to the electrode (“mediated electron transfer”). The former technique is possible only with certain types of enzymes whose [[active site|activation sites]] are close to the enzyme’s surface, but doing so presents fewer [[toxicity]] risks for fuel cells intended to be used inside the human body.&lt;ref name=Moe /&gt;  Finally, completely processing the complex fuels used in enzymatic biofuel cells requires a series of different enzymes for each step of the ‘metabolism’ process; producing some of the required enzymes and maintaining them at the required levels can pose problems.&lt;ref name=Sokic&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sokic-Lazic|first=Daria|author2=Shelley D. Minteer|title=Pyruvate/Air Enzymatic Biofuel Cell Capable of Complete Oxidation|journal=Electrochemical Solid-State Letters|year=2009|volume=12|issue=9|doi=10.1149/1.3170904|pages=F26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early work with biofuel cells, which began in the early 20th century, was purely of the [[microbial fuel cell|microbial]] variety.&lt;ref name=Atan /&gt;  Research on using enzymes directly for oxidation in biofuel cells began in the early 1960s, with the first enzymatic biofuel cell being produced in 1964.&lt;ref name=Atan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yahiro&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yahiro|first1=A. T.|last2=Lee|first2=S. M.|last3=Kimble|first3=D. O.|title=Bioelectrochemistry: I. Enzyme utilizing bio-fuel cell studies|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|year=1964|volume=88|issue=2|pages=375–383|doi=10.1016/0926-6577(64)90192-5|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0926-6577(64)90192-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research began as a product of [[NASA|NASA’s]] interest in finding ways to recycle [[human waste]] into usable energy on board [[spacecraft]], as well as a component of the quest for an [[artificial heart]], specifically as a power source that could be put directly into the human body.&lt;ref name=Bullen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bullen|first=R. A.|title=Biofuel cells and their development|journal=Biosensors and Bioelectronics|year=2006|volume=21|issue=11|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two applications – use of animal or vegetable products as fuel and development of a power source that can be directly implanted into the human body without external refueling – remain the primary goals for developing these biofuel cells.&lt;ref name=Ivan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ivanov|first=Ivan|title=Recent Advances in Enzymatic Fuel Cells: Experiments and Modeling|journal=Energies|year=2010|volume=3|issue=4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial results, however, were disappointing. While the early cells did successfully produce [[electricity]], there was difficulty in transporting the electrons liberated from the glucose fuel to the fuel cell’s electrode and further difficulties in keeping the system stable enough to produce electricity at all due to the enzymes’ tendency to move away from where they needed to be in order for the fuel cell to function.&lt;ref name=Moe /&gt; These difficulties led to an abandonment by biofuel cell researchers of the enzyme-catalyst model for nearly three decades in favor of the more conventional metal catalysts (principally platinum), which are used in most fuel cells.&lt;ref name=Moe /&gt; Research on the subject did not begin again until the 1980s after it was realized that the metallic-catalyst method was not going to be able to deliver the qualities desired in a biofuel cell, and since then work on enzymatic biofuel cells has revolved around the resolution of the various problems that plagued earlier efforts at producing a successful enzymatic biofuel cell.&lt;ref name=Moe /&gt;

However, many of these problems were resolved in 1998. In that year, it was announced that researchers had managed to completely oxidize [[methanol]] using a series (or “cascade”) of enzymes in a biofuel cell.&lt;ref name=Pal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palmore|first=G.Tayhas R.|title=A methanol/dioxygen biofuel cell that uses NAD+-dependent dehydrogenases as catalysts: application of an electro-enzymatic method to regenerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide at low overpotentials|journal=Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry|year=1998|volume=443|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous to this time, the enzyme catalysts had failed to completely oxidize the cell’s fuel, delivering far lower amounts of energy than what was expected given what was known about the energy capacity of the fuel.&lt;ref name=Sokic /&gt; While methanol is now far less relevant in this field as a fuel, the demonstrated method of using a series of enzymes to completely oxidize the cell’s fuel gave researchers a way forward, and much work is now devoted to using similar methods to achieve complete oxidation of more complicated compounds, such as glucose.&lt;ref name=Moe /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sokic /&gt; In addition, and perhaps what is more important, 1998 was the year in which enzyme “immobilization” was successfully demonstrated, which increased the usable life of the methanol fuel cell from just eight hours to over a week.&lt;ref name=Moe /&gt; Immobilization also provided researchers with the ability to put earlier discoveries into practice, in particular the discovery of enzymes that can be used to directly transfer electrons from the enzyme to the electrode. This process had been understood since the 1980s but depended heavily on placing the enzyme as close to the electrode as possible, which meant that it was unusable until after immobilization techniques were devised.&lt;ref name=Moe /&gt; 
In addition, developers of enzymatic biofuel cells have applied some of the advances in [[nanotechnology]] to their designs, including the use of [[carbon nanotubes]] to immobilize enzymes directly.&lt;ref name=Moe /&gt; Other research has gone into exploiting some of the strengths of the enzymatic design to dramatically [[miniaturize]] the fuel cells, a process that must occur if these cells are ever to be used with [[implant (medicine)|implantable devices]]. One research team took advantage of the extreme selectivity of the enzymes to completely remove the barrier between [[anode]] and [[cathode]], which is an absolute requirement in fuel cells not of the enzymatic type. This allowed the team to produce a fuel cell that produces 1.1 [[watt|microwatts]] operating at over half a [[volt]] in a space of just 0.01 cubic [[meter|millimeters]].&lt;ref name=Moe /&gt;

While enzymatic biofuel cells are not currently in use outside of the laboratory, as the [[technology]] has advanced over the past decade non-academic organizations have shown an increasing amount of interest in practical applications for the devices. In 2007, [[Sony]] announced that it had developed an enzymatic biofuel cell that can be linked in sequence and used to power an [[mp3 player]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sony|title=Sony Develops 'Bio Battery' Generating Electricity from Sugar|url=http://www.physorg.com/news107101014.html|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 an [[engineer]] employed by the [[US Army]] announced that the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] was planning to conduct [[field trials]] of its own "bio-batteries" in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hurley|first=Christopher|title=The Bio-Battery: Converting Sugar into Electrical Energy|url=http://science.dodlive.mil/2010/08/26/the-bio-battery-converting-sugar-into-electrical-energy/|work=Armed with Science|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In explaining their pursuit of the technology, both organizations emphasized the extraordinary abundance (and extraordinarily low expense) of fuel for these cells, a key advantage of the technology that is likely to become even more attractive if the price of portable energy sources goes up, or if they can be successfully integrated into electronic human implants.

== Feasibility of enzymes as catalysts ==
With respect to fuel cells, enzymes have several advantages to their incorporation. An important enzymatic property to consider is the driving force or potential necessary for successful reaction [[catalysis]]. Many enzymes operate at potentials close to their substrates which is most suitable for fuel cell applications.&lt;ref name=Cracknell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cracknell|first=J.A.|last2=Vincent|first2=K.A.|last3=Armstrong|first3=F.A.| title=Enzymes as working or inspirational electrocatalysts for fuel cells and electrolysis|journal=Chem. Rev.|year=2008|volume=108|pages=2439–2461|doi=10.1021/cr0680639}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chenevier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chenevier|first=P.|last2=Mugherli|first2=L.|last3=Darbe|first3=S.|last4=Darchy|first4=L.|last5=DiManno|first5=S.|last6=Tran|first6=P.D.|last7=Valentino|first7=F.|last8=Iannello|first8=M.|last9=Volbeda|first9=A.|last10=Cavazza|first10=C.|last11=Artero|first11=V.|title=Hydrogenase enzymes: application in biofuel cells and inspiration for the design of noble-metal free catalysts for H2 oxidation|journal=Comptes Rendus Chimie|year=2013|volume=16|pages=491–505|doi=10.1016/j.crci.2012.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the protein matrix surrounding the active site provides many vital functions; selectivity for the substrate, internal electron coupling, acidic/basic properties and the ability to bind to other proteins (or the electrode).&lt;ref name=Cracknell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chenevier/&gt; Enzymes are more stable in the absence of [[proteases]] and enzymes from [[thermophilic]] organisms and thus offer a wider range of temperatures. Usual operating conditions is generally between 20-50&amp;nbsp;°C and pH 4.0 to 8.0.&lt;ref name=Cracknell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chenevier/&gt;

A drawback with the use of enzymes is size; given the large size of enzymes, they yield a low current density per unit electrode area due to the limited space. Since it is not possible to reduce enzyme size, it has been argued that these types of cells will be lower in activity. One solution has been to use three-dimensional electrodes or immobilization on conducting carbon supports which provide high surface area. These electrodes are extended into three-dimensional space which greatly increases the surface area for enzymes to bind thus increasing the current.&lt;ref name=Cracknell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chenevier/&gt;

== Hydrogenase-based biofuel cells ==
As per the definition of biofuel cells, enzymes are used as [[electrocatalyst]]s at both the cathode and anode. In [[hydrogenase]]-based biofuel cells, hydrogenases are present at the [[anode]] for H2 oxidation in which molecular hydrogen is split into electrons and protons. In the case of H2/O2 biofuel cells, the [[cathode]] is coated with [[oxidase]] enzymes which then convert the protons into water.&lt;ref name=Lubitz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lubitz|first=W.|last2=Ogata|first2=H.|last3=Rudiger|first3=O.|last4=Reijerse|first4=E. |title=Hydrogenases|journal=Chem. Rev.|year=2014|volume=114|pages=2081-4148|doi=10.1021/cr4005814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydrogenase as an energy source ===
In recent years, research on hydrogenases has grown significantly due to scientific and technological interest in hydrogen. The bidirectional or [[reversible reaction]] catalyzed by hydrogenase is a solution to the challenge in the development of technologies for the capture and storage of [[renewable energy]] as fuel with use on demand. This can be demonstrated through the chemical storage of electricity obtained from a renewable source (e.g. solar, wind, [[hydrothermal]]) as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during periods of low energy demands. When energy is desired, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be oxidized to produce electricity which is very efficient.&lt;ref name=Lubitz /&gt;

The use of hydrogen in energy converting devices has gained interest due to being a clean [[energy carrier]] and potential transportation fuel.&lt;ref name=Lubitz /&gt;

=== Feasibility of hydrogenase as catalysts ===
In addition to the advantages previously mentioned associated with incorporating enzymes in fuel cells, hydrogenase is a very efficient catalyst for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption forming electrons and protons. [[Platinum]] is typically the catalyst for this reaction however, the activity of hydrogenases are comparable without the issue of [[catalyst poisoning]] by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and CO.&lt;ref name=Lubitz /&gt; In the case of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fuel cells, there is no production of [[greenhouse gases]] where the product is water.&lt;ref name=Lubitz /&gt;

With regards to structural advantages, hydrogenase is highly selective for its substrate. The lack of need for a membrane simplifies the biofuel cell design to be small and compact,&lt;ref name=Lubitz /&gt; given that hydrogenase does not react with oxygen (an [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]]) and the cathode enzymes (typically [[laccase]]) does not react with the fuel. The electrodes are preferably made from carbon which is abundant, renewable and can be modified in many ways or adsorb enzymes with high affinity. The hydrogenase is attached to a surface which also extends the lifetime of the enzyme.&lt;ref name=Cracknell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chenevier/&gt;

=== Challenges ===
There are several difficulties to consider associated with the incorporation of hydrogenase in biofuel cells. These factors must be taken into account to produce an efficient fuel cell.

==== Enzyme immobilization ====
Since the hydrogenase-based biofuel cell hosts a [[redox]] reaction, hydrogenase must be immobilized on the electrode in such a way that it can exchange electrons directly with the electrode to facilitate the transfer of electrons. This proves to be a challenge in that the active site of hydrogenase is buried in the center of the enzyme where the FeS clusters are used as an electron relay to exchange electrons with its natural redox partner.&lt;ref name=Lubitz /&gt;

Possible solutions for greater efficiency of electron delivery include the immobilization of hydrogenase with the most exposed FeS cluster close enough to the electrode or the use of a redox mediator to carry out the electron transfer. Direct electron transfer is also possible through the adsorption of the enzyme on graphite electrodes or covalent attachment to the electrode. Another solution includes the entrapment of hydrogenase in a conductive polymer.&lt;ref name=Lubitz /&gt;

==== Enzyme size ====
Immediate comparison of the size of hydrogenase with standard inorganic molecular catalysts reveal that hydrogenase is very bulky. It is approximately 5&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter compared to 1-5&amp;nbsp;nm for Pt catalysts. This limits the possible electrode coverage by capping the maximum current density.&lt;ref name=Lubitz /&gt;

Since altering the size of hydrogenase is not a possibility, to increase the density of enzyme present on the electrode to maintain fuel cell activity, a porous electrode can be used instead of one that is planar. This increases the electroactive area allowing more enzyme to be loaded onto the electrode. An alternative is to form films with [[graphite]] particles adsorbed with hydrogenase inside a [[polymer]] matrix. The graphite particles then can collect and transport electrons to the electrode surface.&lt;ref name=Lubitz /&gt;

==== Oxidative damage ====
In a biofuel cell, hydrogenase is exposed to two oxidizing threats. O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inactivates most hydrogenases with the exception of [NiFe] through [[diffusion]] of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the active site followed by destructive modification of the [[active site]]. O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the fuel at the cathode and therefore must be physically separated or else the hydrogenase enzymes at the anode would be inactivated. Secondly, there is a positive potential imposed on hydrogenase at the anode by the enzyme on the cathode. This further enhances the inactivation of hydrogenase by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; causing even [NiFe] which was previously O2-tolerant, to be affected.&lt;ref name=Lubitz /&gt;

To avoid inactivation by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a proton exchange membrane can be used to separate the anode and cathode compartments such that O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is unable to diffuse to and destructively modify the active site of hydrogenase.&lt;ref name=Lubitz /&gt;

=== Applications ===

==== Entrapment of hydrogenase in polymers ====
There are many ways to adsorb hydrogenases onto carbon electrodes that have been modified with polymers. An example is a study done by Morozov et al. where they inserted NiFe hydrogenase into polypyrrole films and to provide proper contact to the electrode, there were redox mediators entrapped into the film. This was successful because the hydrogenase density was high in the films and the redox mediator helped to connect all enzyme molecules for catalysis which was about the same power output as hydrogenase in solution.&lt;ref name=Chenevier/&gt;

==== Immobilizing hydrogenase on carbon nanotubes ====
[[Carbon nanotubes]] can also be used for a support for hydrogenase on the electrode due to their ability to assemble in large porous and conductive networks. These hybrids have been prepared using [FeFe] and [NiFe] hydrogenases. The [NiFe] hydrogenase isolated from ''A. aeolicus'' (thermophilic bacteria) was able to oxidize H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with direct electron transfer without a redox mediator with a 10-fold higher catalytic current with stationary CNT-coated electrodes than with bare electrodes.&lt;ref name=Chenevier/&gt;

Another way of coupling hydrogenase to the nanotubes was to covalently bind them to avoid a time delay. Hydrogenase isolated from D. gigas (jumbo squid) was coupled to multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) networks and produced a current ~30 times higher than the graphite-hydrogenase anode. A slight drawback to this method is that the ratio of hydrogenase covering the surface of the nanotube network leaves hydrogenase to cover only the scarce defective spots in the network. It is also found that some adsorption procedures tend to damage the enzymes whereas covalently coupling them stabilized the enzyme and allows it to remain stable for longer. The catalytic activity of hydrogenase-MWCNT electrodes provided stability for over a month whereas the hydrogenase-graphite electrodes only lasted about a week.&lt;ref name=Chenevier/&gt;

==== Hydrogenase-based biofuel cell applications ====
A fully enzymatic hydrogen fuel cell was constructed by the Armstrong group who used the cell to power a watch. The fuel cell consisted of a graphite anode with hydrogenase isolated from R. metallidurans and a graphite cathode modified with fungal laccase. The electrodes were placed in a single chamber with a mixture of 3% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas in air and there was no membrane due to the tolerance of the hydrogenase to oxygen. The fuel cell produced a voltage of 950mV and generated 5.2&amp;nbsp;uW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of electricity. Although this system was very functional, it was still not at optimum output due to the low accessible H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, the lower catalytic activity of the oxygen tolerant hydrogenases and the lower density of catalysts on the flat electrodes.&lt;ref name=Chenevier/&gt;

This system was then later improved by adding a MWCNT network to increase the electrode area.&lt;ref name=Chenevier/&gt;

The '''Europa Imaging System''' ('''EIS''') is a [[visible spectrum]] wide and narrow angle camera on board the planned ''[[Europa Clipper]]'' mission  that will map most of [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] at {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} resolution, and will provide images of selected surface areas at up to 0.5 m resolution.

EIS will provide comprehensive data sets, including [[Cartography|cartographic]] and three-dimensional geologic maps, regional and high-resolution digital [[topography]], [[geographic information system]] data products, color and [[Photometry (optics)|photometric]] data products, a [[geodetic control network]] tied to [[Radar altimeter|radar altimetry]], and a database of plume-search observations.&lt;ref name='Turtle 2014'/&gt; 

==Overview==

EIS combines a narrow-angle camera (NAC) and a wide-angle camera (WAC) designed to address the reconnaissance goals. Both cameras operate on the [[visible spectrum]] (390 to 700&amp;nbsp;nm) and make use of [[push broom scanner]]s for obtaining images with [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectroscopic]] sensors.

The Principal investigator is Elizabeth Turtle.

==Objectives==

The objectives of the EIS instrument are: &lt;ref name='Turtle 2014'&gt; [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AGUFM.P13E..03T The Europa Imaging System (EIS): High-Resolution, 3-D Insight into Europa's Geology, Ice Shell, and Potential for Current Activity].

''American Geophysical Union'', Fall Meeting 2014, abstract #P13E-03. December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Characterize the ice shell by determining its thickness and correlating surface features with subsurface structures detected by ice penetrating radar.
*Constrain formation processes of surface features and the potential for current activity by characterizing endogenic structures, surface units, global cross-cutting relationships, and relationships to Europa's subsurface structure, and by searching for evidence of recent activity, including potential plumes.
*Characterize scientifically compelling landing sites and hazards by determining the nature of the surface at scales relevant to a potential [[Europa Lander (NASA)|Europa Lander]].

==General specifications==

;Narrow angle camera (NAC)
The NAC provides very high-resolution, stereo reconnaissance, generating 2 km wide swaths at 0.5 m pixel scale from 50 km altitude. NAC observations also include: near-global (&gt;95%) mapping of Europa at ≥50 m pixel scale; regional and high-resolution stereo imaging at &lt;1 m/pixel, and high phase angle observations for plume searches.&lt;ref name='Turtle 2014'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Turtle 2016'&gt;[https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2016/pdf/1626.pdf The Europa Imaging System (EIS): High-Resolution Imaging and Topography to Investigate Europa's Geology, Ice Shell, and Potential for Current Activity] (PDF).

LPI Contribution No. 1903, p.1626.&lt;/ref&gt; The NAC will also perform high-phase-angle observations to search for potential plumes, even
when the spacecraft is distant from Europa.&lt;ref name='Turtle 2016'/&gt; 

;Wide angle camera (WAC)
The WAC will acquire stereo reconnaissance, generating digital topographic models with 32 m spatial scale and 4 m vertical precision from 50 km altitude.&lt;ref name='Turtle 2014'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Turtle 2016'/&gt;

==History==
[[Image Metrics]], founded in 2000, is a provider of facial [[animation]] and [[motion capture]] technology within the [[video game]] and [[entertainment]] industries.&lt;ref name=redorbit&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/entertainment/1521585/image_metrics_launches_beta_version_of_facial_animation_solution/| title=Image Metrics Launches Beta Version of Facial Animation Solution| date=August 14, 2008| publisher=Red Orbit| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=venturebeat&gt;{{cite web| url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/01/19/image-metrics-sells-its-faceware-face-animation-technology-to-spin-off/| title=Image Metrics sells its Faceware face animation technology to spin-off| author=Dean Takahashi| date=January 19, 2012| publisher=Venture Beat| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Image Metrics offered a [[Software release cycle|beta]] version of its facial animation technology to [[visual effects]] and film studios. The technology captured an actor’s performance on video, analyzed it, and mapped it onto a [[Computer graphics|CG]] model.&lt;ref name=redorbit/&gt;&lt;ref name=cgpress&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cgpress.org/archives/image_metrics_launches_beta_of_its_facial_animation_system.html| title=Image Metrics launches beta of its facial animation system| date=Aug 13, 2008| publisher=CG Press| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of the beta allowed studios to incorporate the facial animation technology into internal [[Pipeline (software)|pipelines]] rather than going to the Image Metrics studio as they had in the past.&lt;ref name=cgpress/&gt;&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite web| url=https://variety.com/2009/digital/news/image-metrics-and-double-negative-testing-markerless-facial-capture-33600/| title=Image Metrics and Double Negative testing markerless facial capture| date=March 3, 2009| publisher=Variety| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first studio to beta test Image Metric’s software in 2009 was the visual effects studio [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] out of [[London]].&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;

In 2010, Image Metrics launched the facial animation technology platform Faceware. Faceware focused on increasing creative control, efficiency and production speed for animators. The software could be integrated into any pipeline or used with any [[game engine]]. Image Metrics provided training to learn the Faceware [[Computing platform|platform]]. The first studio to sign on as a Faceware customer was [[Bungie]], which incorporated the software into its in-house production.&lt;ref name=gamedeveloper&gt;{{cite web| url=http://gamedeveloper.com/view/news/118500/PreGDC_Image_Metrics_Launches_Faceware_Signs_Bungie.php| title=Pre-GDC: Image Metrics Launches Faceware, Signs Bungie| author=Eric Caoili| date=March 8, 2010| publisher=Gamasutra| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Image Metrics acquired FacePro in 2010, a company that provided automated [[lip sync]]hronization which could be altered for accurate results, and Image Metrics integrated the acquired technology into its facial animation software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dotnet.sys-con.com/node/1490352| title=Image Metrics Acquires Leading Lip Sync Technology Company FacePro| date=August 5, 2010| publisher=.Net Developer's Journal| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/vfx/image-metrics-seals-deal-for-lip-syncers-facepro/| title=Image Metrics Seals Deal for Lip-Syncers FacePro| author=Tom McLean| date=August 6, 2010| publisher=Animation Magazine| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2010, Image Metrics bought Character-FX, a character animation company.&lt;ref name=venturebeat2&gt;{{cite web| url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/06/30/image-metrics-acquires-character-fx-to-build-realistic-3d-game-avatars/| title=Image Metrics Acquires Character-FX to build realistic 3D game avatars| author=Dean Takahashi| date=June 30, 2010| publisher=Venture Beat| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://gfxspeak.com/2011/03/29/image-metrics-looks-for-new-opportunities/| title=Image Metrics looks for new opportunities| author=Kathleen Maher| date=March 29, 2011| publisher=Graphic Speak| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/image-metrics-acquires-facial-animation-firm-character-fx| title=Image Metrics acquires facial animation firm Character-FX| author=David Jenkins| date=July 1, 2010| publisher=Games Industry| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=broadcastnow&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/techfacils/character-fx-sold-to-image-metrics/5015760.article| title=Character-FX sold to Image Metrics| date=July 6, 2010| publisher=Broadcast Now| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Character-FX produced tools for use in [[Autodesk]]’s Maya and 3DS Max which aide in the creation of character facial rigs using an automated weighting transfer system that rapidly shifts facial features on a character to create lifelike movement.&lt;ref name=gamesindustry&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2012-01-19-image-metrics-launches-spin-off-company| title=Image Metrics launches spin-off company| author=Rachel Weber| date=January 19, 2012| publisher=Games Industry| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=venturebeat2/&gt;&lt;ref name=broadcastnow/&gt;

Image Metrics raised $8 million in funding and went public through a [[reverse takeover|reverse merger]] in 2010 with International Cellular Industries. Image Metrics became wholly owned by International Cellular industries, which changed its name and took on facial animation technology as its sole line of business.&lt;ref name=gfxspeak/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://finance.beavercreeknewscurrent.com/what-is-the-history-of-image-metrics-inc-and-the-latest-information-about-image-metrics-inc/otc/image-metrics-inc-imgx/image-metrics-inc-imgx.htm| title=What is the history of Image Metrics Inc and the latest information about Image Metrics Inc?| publisher=Beaver Creek News| accessdate=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/image-metrics-settles-USD8-million-funding-deal| title=Image Metrics settles $8 million funding deal| author=David Jenkins| date=March 11, 2010| publisher=Games Industry| accessdate=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faceware 3.0 was announced in March 2011.

Image Metrics sold the Faceware software to its spinoff company, Faceware Technologies, in January 2012.&lt;ref name=venturebeat/&gt;&lt;ref name=gamesindustry/&gt; Following the spinoff, Faceware Technologies focused on producing and distributing its technology to professional animators.&lt;ref name=venturebeat/&gt; The technology was tested through Universities, including the University of Portsmouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.3dartistonline.com/news/2012/08/faceware-rolls-out-new-educational-program/| title=Faceware rolls out new educational program| author=Chris McMahon| publisher=3D Artist Online| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faceware launched its 3D facial animation tools, software packages Faceware Analyzer and Faceware Retargeter with the Head-Mounted Camera System (HMCS). Analyzer tracks and processes live footage of an actor and Retargeter transfers that movement onto the face of a computer-generated character. The Head-Mounted Camera System is not required to use the software. Six actors can be captured simultaneously.&lt;ref name=cgchannel2&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cgchannel.com/2012/05/faceware-launches-facial-animation-tools-line-up/| title=Faceware launches facial animation tools line-up| author= Jim Thacker| date=May 31, 2012| publisher=CG Channel| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faceware Live was shown for the first time at SIGGRAPH 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/faceware-technology-live-demo-video,23726.html| title=SIGGRAPH 2013: Faceware Technologies Debuts Faceware Live| author=Jon K. Carroll| date=July 29, 2013| publisher=Tom's Hardware| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created to enable the real-time capture and retargeting of facial movements. The live capture of facial performance can use any video source to track and translate facial expressions into a set of animation values and transfer the captured data onto a 3D animated character in real time.&lt;ref name=organicmotion&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.organicmotion.com/face-off-with-faceware-live/| title=Face Off With Faceware Live| publisher=Organic Motion| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Faceware released Faceware Live 2.0. The update included the option to stream multiple characters simultaneously, instant calibration, improved facial tracking, consistent calibration, and support for high-frame-rate cameras.&lt;ref name=cgchannel&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cgchannel.com/2014/08/faceware-technologies-ships-faceware-live-2-0/| title=Faceware Technologies ships Faceware Live 2.0| author= Jim Thacker| date=August 8, 2014| publisher=CG Channel| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Faceware launched a plugin for [[Unreal Engine#Unreal Engine 4|Unreal Engine 4]] called Faceware Live. The company co-developed the plugin with Australia-based Opaque Multimedia. It makes motion capture of  expressions and other facial movements possible with any video camera through Faceware's markerless 3D facial motion capture software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Facial Motion Capture In Unreal Engine Can Now Be Done With Any Camera | last=Carbotte |first=Kevin |date=August 11, 2015 |publisher=TomsHardware |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/facial-motion-capture-in-ue4,29816.html |access-date=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Faceware announced the launch of Faceware Interactive, which is focused on the development of software and hardware that can be used in the creation of digital characters with whom real people can interact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalmediaworld.tv/animation/997-faceware-s-interactive-division-to-focus-on-live-to-virtual-interactions|title=Faceware’s Interactive Division to Focus on Live-to-Virtual Interactions|last=Hurst|first=Adriene|website=www.digitalmediaworld.tv|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partners==
Faceware Technologies partnered with Binari Sonori in 2014 to develop a video-based localization service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://gamingbolt.com/faceware-technologies-partners-with-binari-sonori-to-offer-new-video-based-localization-service| title=Faceware Technologies Partners with Binari Sonori to Offer New Video-Based Localization Service| date=April 30, 2014| publisher=Gaming Bolt| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.digitalmedia-world.com/Games/faceware-binari-sonori-talk-the-talk-on-video-voice-localization.html| title=Faceware &amp; Binari Sonori Talk the Talk on Video Voice Localization| publisher=Digital Media World| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2014, Faceware Technologies entered a global partnership with Vicon, a company focused on motion capture. The partnership would focus on developing new technology to expand into full-body motion capture data. The first step of the integration was to make the Faceware software compatible with Vicon’s head rig, Cara, to allow data acquired from Cara to be processed and transferred into Faceware products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.digitalmedia-world.com/Animation/faceware-and-vicon-partner-to-improve-facial-full-body-mocap.html| title=Faceware and Vicon Partner to Improve Facial &amp; Full-Body Mocap| date=January 28, 2014| publisher=Digital Media World| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.slashgear.com/faceware-and-vicon-pair-up-motion-capture-products-in-new-partnership-28314686/| title=Faceware and Vicon pair up motion capture products in new partnership| date=January 28, 2014| author=Brittany Hillen| publisher=Slash Gear| accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Faceware Technologies has two main aspects of facial animation software.&lt;ref name=gfxspeak/&gt;

Faceware Analyzer is a stand-alone single-camera facial tracking software that converts videos of facial motion into files that can be used for Faceware Retargeter. The Lite version of the software can automatically track facial movements which can be applied to [[3D modeling|3D models]] with Faceware Retargeter. The Pro version can perform shot specific custom calibrations, import and export actor data, auto indicate tracking regions, and has server and local [[license|licensing]] options. The data captured by Faceware Analyzer is then processed in Faceware Retargeter.&lt;ref name=gfxspeak/&gt;

Faceware Retargeter 4.0 was announced in 2014. Faceware Retargeter uses facial tracking data created in Analyzer to create facial animation in a pose-based workflow. The upgrade has a plug-in for Autodesk animation tools, advanced character expression sets, visual tracking data, shared pose thumbnails, and batch processing. The Lite version of the Retargeter software transfers actor’s performances onto animated characters and reduces and smooths [[key frame]]s. The Pro version includes custom poses, intelligent pose suggestions, shared pose libraries, and the ability to backup and restore jobs.&lt;ref name=gfxspeak/&gt;

Faceware Live aims to create natural looking faces and facial expressions in real-time. Any video source can be used with the software’s one-button calibration. The captured video is transferred onto a 3D animated character. This process combines image processing and data streaming to translate facial expressions into a set of animation values.&lt;ref name=organicmotion/&gt;&lt;ref name=cgchannel/&gt;

Faceware has hardware options that can be rented or purchased. Available hardware is the entry level GoPro Headcam Kit and the Professional Headcam System.&lt;ref name=gfxspeak/&gt; The Indie Facial Mo-cap package includes hardware, a camera and headmount, and the tools to use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.develop-online.net/tools-and-tech/faceware-of-change-facial-mo-cap-for-indies/0192264| title=The Facial animation firm has conceived a new offering for indies and mobile teams.

'''''Geographic Resources Analysis Support System''''' (commonly termed '''''GRASS GIS''''') is a [[geographic information system]] (GIS) software suite used for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, producing graphics and maps, spatial and temporal modeling, and visualizing. It can handle [[raster graphics|raster]], [[topological]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], [[image processing]], and [[computer graphics|graphic]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1 = Neteler |first1 = M. |last2=Mitasova |first2=H. | title = Open Source GIS: a GRASS GIS approach |edition=3rd | year = 2008 | publisher = Springer | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-387-35767-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GRASS GIS contains over 350 modules to render maps and images on monitor and paper; manipulate raster and vector data including vector networks; process multispectral image data; and create, manage, and store spatial data.

It is licensed and released as [[free and open-source software]] under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL). It runs on multiple [[operating system]]s, including {{nowrap|[[OS X]]}}, [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Linux]]. Users can interface with the software features through a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) or by ''plugging into'' GRASS via other software such as [[QGIS]]. They can also interface with the modules directly through a bespoke [[shell (computing)|shell]] that the application launches or by calling individual modules directly from a standard shell. The latest stable release version (LTS) is GRASS GIS 7, which is available since 2015

The GRASS Development Team is a multinational group consisting of developers at many locations. GRASS is one of the eight initial Software Projects of the [[Open Source Geospatial Foundation]].

==Architecture==
GRASS supports raster and vector data in two and three dimensions. The vector data model is [[topological]], meaning that areas are defined by boundaries and centroids; boundaries cannot overlap within one layer. In contrast, OpenGIS [[Simple Features]], defines vectors more freely, much as a non-georeferenced vector illustration program does.

GRASS is designed as an environment in which tools that perform specific GIS computations are executed. Unlike GUI-based [[application software]], the GRASS user is presented with a Unix shell containing a modified environment that supports execution of GRASS commands, termed modules. The environment has a [[State (computer science)|state]] that includes parameters such as the geographic region covered and the [[map projection]] in use. All GRASS modules read this state and additionally are given specific parameters (such as input and output maps, or values to use in a computation) when executed. Most GRASS modules and abilities can be operated via a graphical user interface (provided by a GRASS module), as an alternative to manipulating geographic data in a shell.

The GRASS distribution includes  over 350 core modules. Over 100 add-on modules created by users are offered on its website. The libraries and core modules are written in [[C (programming language)|C]]. Other modules are written in C, [[C++]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], Unix shell, [[Tcl]], or other scripting languages. The modules are designed under the [[Unix philosophy]] and hence can be combined using Python or shell scripting to build more complex or specialized modules, by users, without knowledge of C programming.

There is cooperation between the GRASS and Quantum GIS ([[QGIS]]) projects.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Recent versions of QGIS can be executed within the GRASS environment, allowing QGIS to be used as a user-friendly graphical interface to GRASS that more closely resembles other graphical GIS software than does the shell-based GRASS interface.

Another project exists to re-implement GRASS in [[Java (software platform)|Java]] as ''JGRASS''.

==History==
GRASS has been under continuous development since 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Westervelt |first1=J. |year=2004 |title=GRASS roots |conference=FOSS/GRASS Users Conference |pages=12–14 |location=Bangkok, Thailand |url=http://geni.isnew.info/grass/Jim-Westervelt.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032219/http://geni.isnew.info/grass/Jim-Westervelt.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has involved a large number of federal US agencies, universities, and private companies. The core components of GRASS and the management of integration of efforts into its releases was originally directed by the U.S. Army - Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (USA-CERL), a branch of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], in [[Champaign, Illinois]]. USA-CERL completed its last release of GRASS as version 4.1 in 1992, and provided five updates and patches to this release through 1995. USA-CERL also wrote the core components of the GRASS 5.0 floating point version.

The development of GRASS was started by the USA-CERL to meet the need of the United States military for software for [[land management]] and [[environmental planning]]. A key motive was the [[National Environmental Policy Act]]. The development platform was [[Unix]] running on [[VAX]] hardware. During 1982 through 1995, USA-CERL led the development of GRASS, with the involvement of many others, including universities and other federal agencies. USA-CERL officially ceased its involvement in GRASS after release 4.1 (1995), though development had been limited to minor patches since 1993. A group formed at [[Baylor University]] to take over the software, releasing GRASS 4.2. Around this time, a port of the software to [[Linux]] was made. In 1998, [[Markus Neteler]], the current project leader, announced the release of GRASS 4.2.1, which offered major improvements including a new [[graphical user interface]]. In October 1999, the license of the originally [[public domain software]] GRASS software was changed to the GNU GPL in version 5.0.&lt;ref&gt;GRASS Development Team. ''[http://grass.osgeo.org/devel/grasshist.html GRASS History]''. Retrieved on 2008-03-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, GRASS has evolved into a powerful software suite with a wide range of applications in many different areas of [[scientific research]] and [[engineering]]. For example, it is used to estimate potential solar [[photovoltaic]] yield with [[r.sun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=H.T.|author2=Pearce, J.M.|title=Estimating potential photovoltaic yield with r.sun and the open source Geographical Resources Analysis Support System|journal=Solar Energy|volume=84|issue=5|pages=831–843|doi=10.1016/j.solener.2010.02.009}} [https://www.academia.edu/1485006/Estimating_Potential_Photovoltaic_Yield_with_r.sun_and_the_Open_Source_Geographical_Resources_Analysis_Support_System open access]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofierka J., Šúri M.

"A New GIS‐based Solar Radiation Model and Its Application to Photovoltaic Assessments." Transactions in GIS 8.2 (2004): 175-190.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, GRASS is used in academic and commercial settings around the world, and in many government agencies including [[NASA]], [[NOAA]], [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], [[German Aerospace Center|DLR]], [[CSIRO]], the [[National Park Service]], the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], [[USGS]], and many [[environmental consulting]] companies.

{{As of|2015}}, the latest stable release version (LTS) is GRASS GIS 7. It was released in 2015, replacing the old stable branch (6.4) which was released in 2011. Version 7 added many new features, including large data support, a fast topological 2D/3D vector engine, powerful vector network analysis, a full temporal framework and many other features and improvements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/Grass7/NewFeatures Version 7 new features]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2015}}, GRASS development is split into two branches: stable and developmental.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grass.osgeo.org/download/software/#g70x stable branch (7.0)], and an [http://grass.osgeo.org/download/software/#g71x experimental/development branch (7.1)]&lt;/ref&gt; The stable branch is recommended for most users, while the 7.1 branch operates as a testbed for new features.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1185">A '''guideline tensioner''' is a [[hydropneumatic]] device used on an [[offshore drilling rig]] that keeps a positive pulling force on the guidelines from the platform to a template on the seabed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Petroleum Exploration, Drilling &amp; Production|first=Norman J|last=Hyne|pages=232|isbn=0-87814-352-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines act as a guidance for equipment and tools that must be lowered to the template. If there was no tensioner and the platform moved, the guidelines would become slack and could be broken. For this reason a number of guideline tensioners are mounted between the platform and riser. Each of these guideline tensioners consists of a [[hydraulic cylinder]] with [[sheave]]s at both sides. The cylinder is connected to one or more high pressure gas bottles via a medium separator. A wire rope is rigged in the cylinder; one end is connected to the fixed part of the tensioner, the other end to the template.

'''Harris Ranch''', or the '''Harris Cattle Ranch''', [[feedlot]] is [[California]]'s largest [[beef cattle|beef]] producer and the largest ranch on the [[West Coast of the United States]], producing 150,000,000 pounds of [[beef]] per year in 2010.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harris Ranch markets farm-to-fork|first=Olivia|last=Munoz|publisher=Associated Press|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_16248323|date=October 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is located alongside [[Interstate 5]] at its intersection with [[California State Route 198]] east of [[Coalinga, California|Coalinga]], in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] of [[central California]].  The [[ranch]] is owned by Harris Farms.

== Description ==

===History===
Founded by Jack Harris in 1937, the Harris Ranch Beef Company (now operated by Jack Harris' son [[John C. Harris|John]]) was originally a cotton and grain operation.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; In the 1970s the ranch opened a burger stand near [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reynolds |first=Christopher |date=16 February 2017 |title=Gnaw beef (or charge your Tesla) at Harris Ranch in Coalinga |url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-california-bucket-list-updates-gnaw-beef-or-charge-your-tesla-at-1484008863-htmlstory.html |work=Los Angeles Times |location= |access-date=17 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The farm also operates an inn and restaurant, raises fruit and vegetable crops, and breeds [[thoroughbred]] horses.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harrisranchbeef.com/aboutus/history.html HRBC | About Us | Our History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the operation has more than 400 employees.&lt;ref name=cwc&gt;{{cite news| title=Stop at Harris Ranch like visiting destination resort| author=Cary Ordway|url=http://www.californiaweekend.com/california-vacation/harris-ranch.html| publisher=California Weekend Getaways}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately {{convert|14000|acre|abbr=on}} are devoted to [[garlic]], [[broccoli]], [[pomegranate]]s, and [[tomato]]es, among 35 types of fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name=wa/&gt;

During the [[War on Terror]], volunteers from the [[San Joaquin Valley]], especially Bakersfield, supplied with beef from Harris Ranch, have volunteered to serve steaks to servicemembers who are [[OCONUS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hardisty |first=Dianne |date=3 July 2010 |title=A call to serve ... meat |url=http://www.bakersfield.com/news/a-call-to-serve-meat/article_3bc71b73-662c-565f-a8bf-a90e772fd9c0.html |work=TBC Media |location=Bakersfield, California |access-date=17 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 


In January 2012, an [[arson]]ist destroyed fourteen [[cattle truck]]s on the ranch. The [[Animal Liberation Front]] claimed responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Animal-rights arson at Harris Ranch?| first=Henry K.| last=Lee| publisher=San Francisco Chronicle| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/01/10/BABM1MN8BU.DTL#ixzz1j5DR39e1| date=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/01/animal-rights-activists.html| title=Animal rights activists take credit for blaze at cattle ranch| last=Marble| first=Steve| date=10 January 2012| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing and distribution===
At over {{convert|800|acre|abbr=on}} and with a population of over 100,000 cattle,&lt;ref name=wa&gt;{{citeweb|publisher=Weekend America|title=Coming Home to a Smell|author=Krissy Clark|date=December 22, 2007|url= http://weekendamerica.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/12/21/coalinga/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hundreds harvested daily, the ranch is the largest on the West Coast. It is also among the largest (when including density) in the United States. A [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]] operation, it owns a fleet of trucks that take [[cattle]] from several ranches with which it deals, and does its own finishing, [[Animal slaughter|slaughtering]], and packaging.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

The ranch supplies the [[hamburger]] meat for the [[In-N-Out Burger]] chain, and also distributes beef and prepared meals through grocery stores and restaurants nationwide.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cwc/&gt;

Harris Ranch was one of the first to build a brand around itself as a specialty niche product, and is credited as a forerunner of companies like [[Niman Ranch]] and [[Dakota Beef]].&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

===Restaurant and inn===
The restaurant was targeted to local farmers when it opened in 1977, but later became popular as a halfway stop on the busy highway connecting [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=Fast Company| date=February 24, 2010| title=Earl Cox's Tesla Charging Station Makes Electric Roadtrip From L.A. to S.F. a Reality| first=Ariel| last=Schwartz| url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1561593/tesla-chargepoint-installed-halfway-between-la-and-san-francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hian |first=Howard |date=1 May 2018 |title=A surprising discovery: Harris Ranch |url=http://www.militarypress.com/a-surprising-discovery-harris-ranch/ |work=Military Press |location=San Diego |access-date=17 July 2018 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=Pacifica Tribune| title=Wandering and Wondering| first=John| last=Maybury| date=February 7, 2012| url=http://www.mercurynews.com/opinion/ci_19914351}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 153-room luxury inn was added in 1987.&lt;ref name=wa/&gt; It was built in [[hacienda]]-[[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|style]].&lt;ref name=MilPress/&gt; The restaurant evolved into a "farm to fork" concept in the late 2000s, featuring not only beef but wine and other products made locally by the ranch.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;  As of 2008 the restaurant was the 57th busiest in the United States and sixth busiest in California based on gross receipts.&lt;ref name=cwc/&gt; The site was chosen as one of the first [[battery swapping]] [[Tesla station]]s.&lt;ref name=gom20130807&gt;

'''Heavy equipment''' refers to heavy-duty [[vehicle]]s, specially designed for executing [[construction]] tasks, most frequently ones involving [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork operations]]. They are also known as '''heavy machines''', '''heavy trucks''', '''construction equipment''', '''engineering equipment''', '''heavy vehicles''', or '''heavy hydraulics'''. They usually comprise five equipment systems: implement, [[traction (engineering)|traction]], structure, [[power train]], control and information.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=JCEMD4000132000009000976000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;prog=normal C. B. Tatum et al., J. Constr. Engrg. and Mgmt. 132, 987 (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy equipment functions through the [[mechanical advantage]] of a [[simple machine]], the [[ratio]] between input force applied and force exerted is multiplied. Some equipment uses [[Hydraulic drive system|hydraulic drives]] as a primary source of motion.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The use of heavy equipment has a long history; the [[Roman engineering|ancient Roman engineer]] [[Vitruvius]] (1st century BCE) gave descriptions of [[Roman technology#Engineering and construction|heavy equipment]] and [[Roman crane|cranes]] in [[ancient Rome]] in his [[treatise]] ''[[De architectura]]''. The [[pile driver]] was invented around 1500. The first [[tunnelling shield]] was patented by [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] in 1818.

===From horses, through steam, to diesel===
[[File:Bell telephone magazine (1922) (14569641579).jpg|thumb|300px|Heavy equipment circa 1922]]
[[File:Fresno scrapers Miocene ditch.jpg|thumb|horse-drawn scraper digging water-supply ditch]]
Until the 19th century and into the early 20th century heavy machines were drawn under human or animal power. With the advent of [[portable engine|portable]] steam-powered engines the drawn machine precursors were reconfigured with the new engines, such as the [[combine harvester]]. The design of a core tractor evolved around the new steam power source into a new machine core [[traction engine]], that can be configured as the [[steam tractor]] and the [[steamroller]]. During the 20th century, [[internal-combustion engine]]s became the major power source of heavy equipment. [[Kerosene]] and [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] engines were used, but today [[diesel engine]]s are dominant. [[Mechanical transmission]] was in many cases replaced by hydraulic machinery. The early 20th century also saw new electric-powered machines such as the [[forklift]]. [[Caterpillar Inc.]] is a present-day brand from these days, starting out as the [[Holt Manufacturing Company]]. The first mass-produced heavy machine was the [[Fordson tractor]] in 1917.

The first commercial [[continuous track]] vehicle was the 1901 [[Lombard Steam Log Hauler]]. The use of tracks became popular for [[tank]]s during [[World War I]], and later for civilian machinery like the bulldozer. The largest engineering vehicles and mobile land machines are [[bucket-wheel excavator]]s, built since the 1920s.

"Until almost the twentieth century, one simple tool constituted the primary earthmoving machine: the [[hand shovel]] - moved with animal and human powered, sleds, barges, and wagons. This tool was the principal method by which material was either sidecast or elevated to load a conveyance, usually a [[wheelbarrow]], or a cart or wagon drawn by a [[draft animal]]. In antiquity, an equivalent of the hand shovel or hoe and head basket—and masses of men—were used to move earth to build civil works. Builders have long used the [[inclined plane]], levers, and [[pulley]]s to place solid building materials, but these labor-saving devices did not lend themselves to earthmoving, which required digging, raising, moving, and placing loose materials. The two elements required for mechanized earthmoving, then as now, were an independent power source and off-road mobility, neither of which could be provided by the technology of that time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haycraft | first1 = William R. | year = | title = History of Construction Equipment | doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000374 | journal = Journal of Construction Engineering and Management | volume = 137| issue = | pages = 720–723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Container crane]]s were used from the 1950s and onwards, and made [[containerization]] possible.

Nowadays such is the importance of this machinery, some transport companies have developed specific equipment to transport heavy construction equipment to and from sites.

==Types==
These subdivisions, in this order, are the standard heavy equipment categorization.
&lt;!-- A comparison of similar models of equipment with wiki articles across manufacturers would be informative, but a bare list of model numbers, lacking any model-specific details or sources.
Some contractors place numbers on the side of their equipment corresponding to the category - Grader '02' - followed by a sequential number that usually corresponds to the number it was purchased, for example, 02-112, is the 112th grader a company has purchased since their founding. This allows for easy recognition of the equipment type and the relevant age.--&gt;

==Traction: Off-the-road tires and Tracks==

[[File:Hornsby.jpg|thumb|Continuous track (circa 1909)]]
[[File:Caterpillar track shingle.JPG|thumb|Caterpillar track (circa 2009)]]

Heavy equipment requires specialized [[tire]]s for various construction applications. While many types of equipment have [[Caterpillar track|continuous tracks]] applicable to more severe service requirements, tires are used where greater speed or mobility is required. An understanding of what equipment will be used for during the life of the tires is required for proper selection. Tire selection can have a significant impact on production and unit cost. There are three types of off-the-road tires, ''transport'' for earthmoving machines, ''work'' for slow moving earthmoving machines, and ''load and carry'' for transporting as well as digging. Off-highway tires have six categories of service '''C''' compactor, '''E''' earthmover, '''G''' grader, '''L''' loader, '''LS''' log-skidder and '''ML''' mining and logging. Within these service categories are various tread types designed for use on hard-packed surface, soft surface and rock. Tires are a large expense on any construction project, careful consideration should be given to prevent excessive wear or damage.

==Heavy equipment operator==
{{main|Heavy equipment operator}}

A heavy equipment operator drives and operates [[heavy equipment (construction)|heavy equipment]] used in [[engineering]] and [[construction]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos255.htm U.S. Department of Labor - Occupational Outlook Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Construction Safety Handbook |author= V. J. Davies, Ken Tomasin|year=1996|publisher=Thomas Telford|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN072772519X&amp;id=rpzFtFbGoq0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA59&amp;lpg=RA1-PA59&amp;dq=Excavator+driver&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;sig=8-nhK2jVcTdmP5l19jBclE6nO34|isbn=0-7277-2519-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically only [[skilled workers]] may operate heavy equipment, and there is specialized training for learning to use heavy equipment.

Much publication about heavy equipment operators focuses on improving safety for such workers. The field of [[occupational medicine]] researches and makes recommendations about safety for these and other workers in safety-sensitive positions.

==Equipment cost==

Due to the small profit margins on construction projects it is important to maintain accurate records concerning equipment utilization, repairs and maintenance. The two main categories of equipment costs are ownership cost and [[operating cost]].&lt;ref&gt;Peurifoy &amp; Schexnayder "Construction Planning Equipment, and Methods" McGraw Hill 6th edition {{ISBN|0-07-232176-8}}, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ownership Cost===

To classify as an ownership cost an expense must have been incurred regardless of if the equipment is used or not. These costs are as follows:

{{div col|colwidth=18em}}
*[[price|purchase expense]]
*[[salvage value]]
*[[MACRS|tax savings]] from depreciation
*major repairs and [[wikt:overhaul|overhaul]]s
*[[property taxes]]
*[[insurance]]
*storage
{{div col end}}

[[Depreciation]] can be calculated several ways, the simplest is the straight-line method. The annual depreciation is constant, reducing the equipment value annually. The following are simple equations paraphrased from the Peurifoy &amp; Schexnayder text:
{|
|-
|width=50%|
''m'' = some year in the future

N = equipment useful life (years)

and D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = Annual depreciation amount

:'''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = ''purchase price'' / N'''

[[Book value]] (BV) in year ''m''

:'''BV&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = ''purchase price'' - (''m'' x D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)'''
|width=50%|
'''example:'''

N = 5

''purchase price'' = $350,000

''m'' = 3 years from now

:BV&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = $350,000 - ( 3 x $350,000/5) = $140,000
|}

===Operating cost===
For an expense to be classified as an operating cost, it must be incurred through use of the equipment. These costs are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew, S.H. "Estimating and Bidding for Heavy Construction" CSU Chico, Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-598327-4}}, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

|width=33%|
*[[repairs]]
**repair parts
**repair labor
|width=33%|
*[[tires]]
*3rd party service contract
*replacement of high-wear items
|}

The biggest distinction from a cost standpoint is if a repair is classified as a ''major repair'' or a ''minor repair''. A major repair can change the depreciable equipment value due to an extension in [[service life]], while a minor repair is normal [[maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]]. How a firm chooses to cost major and minor repairs vary from firm to firm depending on the costing strategies being used. Some firms will charge only major repairs to the equipment while minor repairs are costed to a project. Another common costing strategy is to cost all repairs to the equipment and only frequently replaced wear items are excluded from the equipment cost. Many firms keep their costing structure closely guarded{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} as it can impact the bidding strategies of their competition. In a company with multiple semi-independent divisions, the equipment department often wants to classify all repairs as "minor" and charge the work to a job - therefore improving their 'profit' from the equipment.

==Models==
{{main|Model construction vehicle}}
[[Die-cast toy|Die-cast]] metal promotional [[scale model]]s of '''heavy equipment''' are often produced for each vehicle to give to prospective customers. These are typically in [[1:50 scale]]. The popular manufacturers of these models are [[Conrad (company)|Conrad]] and [[NZG Models|NZG]] in Germany, even for US vehicles.

The '''IAWTV Awards''' is an annual event hosted by the [[International Academy of Web Television]], currently based in [[Los Angeles]], that honors [[web series]] creators and talent in over a dozen categories, voted on by the IAWTV membership.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iawtv.org/about-the-iawtv-awards/|title=About the IAWTV Awards|website=International Academy of Web Television|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== History ==

The IAWTV Awards are hosted annually by the International Academy of Web Television (IAWTV), which was founded in 2008 and is devoted to the advancement of the arts and sciences of web television production.

=== Inception ===

In 2010, before the IAWTV Awards existed, the IAWTV hosted the [[2nd Streamy Awards|2nd annual]] [[Streamy Awards]].&lt;ref name="Tilzy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tilzy.tv/transparency-the-streamys-and-the-iawtv.htm|title=Transparency.

=== 2011–present ===

Since its inception in 2011, the IAWTV has held award ceremonies every year (with the exception of 2016), presenting awards to web series creators and talent in over a dozen categories, covering several genres. Notable IAWTV winners include [[Felicia Day]], [[Julia Stiles]] and [[Milo Ventimiglia]], as well as the critically acclaimed web series ''[[The Guild (web series)|The Guild]]'', ''[[Blue (web series)|Blue]]'', ''[[Anyone But Me]]'', ''[[Husbands (TV series)|Husbands]]'', ''[[Leap Year (TV_series)|Leap Year]]'', and ''[[Whatever, Linda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://playbackonline.ca/2015/04/16/canadian-web-series-take-home-eight-iawtv-awards/|title=Canadian web series take home eight IAWTV Awards|access-date=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2012 and 2015, the IAWTV Awards were held in [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iawtv.org/about-the-iawtv-awards/|title=About the IAWTV Awards|website=International Academy of Web Television|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 ceremony took place in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

[[Image:Safety Layer Protection.png|thumb|300px|Safety Layer Protection.]]

An '''industrial safety system''' is a countermeasure crucial in any [[hazard]]ous [[manufacturing plant|plant]]s such as [[Petroleum industry|oil and gas]] plants and [[nuclear plant]]s. They are used to protect [[human]], [[industrial plant]], and the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] in case of the [[process manufacturing|process]] going  beyond the allowed control margins.

As the name suggests, these systems are not intended for controlling the process itself but rather protection. [[Process control]] is performed by means of [[process control system]]s (PCS) and is [[interlock]]ed by the [[safety]] systems so that immediate actions are taken should the process control systems fail.

Process control and safety systems are usually merged under one system, called ''[[Integrated Control and Safety System]]'' (ICSS).
Industrial safety systems typically use dedicated systems that are [[safety integrity level|SIL 2]] certified at minimum; whereas control systems can start with [[safety integrity level|SIL 1]]. SIL applies to both hardware and software requirements such as cards, processors redundancy and voting functions.

==Types==
There are 2 main types of industrial safety systems in process industry:&lt;ref&gt;Most of this article is summarized from some [[Yemen LNG]] documentation on safety systems, No. YE-001-30-POC-JBS-25300 and YE-001-30-POC-JBS-25200.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Process Safety System or Process Shutdown System, (PSS).
* Safety Shutdown System (SSS): This includes Emergency Shutdown-(ESD) and Emergency Depressurization-(EDP) Systems.
A third system also exists which acts as a barrier and contains the spray out of hot oil &amp; gases from flanges, valves &amp; pipe joints. These systems are popularly known as safety spray shields and flange guards.The use of spray guards is mandated by OSHA.

== ESD ==
These systems may also be redefined in terms of ESD/EDP levels as:
* ESD level 1: In charge of general plant area shutdown, can activate ESD level 2 if necessary. This level can only be activated from main [[control room]] in the process industrial plants.
* ESD level 2: This level shuts down and isolates individual ESD zones and activates if necessary EDP.
* ESD level 3: provides "liquid inventory containment".

===SSS===
The safety shutdown system (SSS) shall shut down the facilities to a safe state in case of an emergency situation, thus protecting personnel, the environment and the asset. The safety shutdown system shall manage all inputs and outputs relative to emergency shutdown (ESD) functions (environment and personnel protection). This system might also be fed by signals from the main fire and gas system.

===FGS===
The main objectives of the fire and gas system are to protect personnel, environment, and plant (including equipment and structures).
The FGS shall achieve these objectives by:
* Detecting at an early stage, the presence of flammable gas,
* Detecting at an early stage, the liquid spill (LPG and LNG),
* Detecting incipient fire and the presence of fire,
* Providing automatic and/or facilities for manual activation of the [[fire protection]] system as required,
* Initiating environmental changes to keep liquids below their [[flash point]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falckproductions.com/resources/fire-safety-and-firewatch/flashpoints-industrial-workplaces/|title=Flash Points and Industrial Fire Safety Videos|publisher=Falck Productions|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Initiating signals, both audible and visible as required, to warn of the detected hazards,
* Initiating automatic shutdown of equipment and ventilation if 2 out of 2 or 2 out of 3 detectors are triggered,
* Initiating the exhausting system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;amp;p_id=10631|title=Ventilation. - 1926.57|publisher=U.S. DOL, OSHA|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EDP ==
Due to closing ESD valves in a process, there may be some trapped [[flammable]] [[fluid]]s, and these must be released in order to avoid any undesired consequences (such as [[pressure]] increase in vessels and [[piping]]). For this, emergency depressurization (EDP) systems are used in conjunction with the ESD systems to release (to a safe location and in a safe manner) such trapped fluids.

== Pressure safety valves ==
[[Pressure safety valve]]s or PSVs are  usually used as a final safety solution when all previous systems fail to prevent any further pressure accumulation and protect vessels from rupture due to [[overpressure]] by their designed  action.

{{Information science}}
'''Information technology''' ('''IT''') is the use of [[computer]]s to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate [[data (computing)|data]],&lt;ref name="DOP"&gt;{{citation |contribution=IT |title=A Dictionary of Physics |editor-last=Daintith |editor-first=John |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t83.e1592 |access-date=1 August 2012|isbn=9780199233991 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[information]], often in the context of a business or other enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foldoc.org/information+technology|title=Free on-line dictionary of computing (FOLDOC)|access-date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; IT is considered to be a subset of [[information and communications technology]] (ICT).

Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the [[Sumer]]ians in [[Mesopotamia]] developed [[cuneiform|writing]] in about 3000&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{citation |last=Butler |first=Jeremy G. |title=A History of Information Technology and Systems |url=http://www.tcf.ua.edu/AZ/ITHistoryOutline.htm |publisher=University of Arizona |access-date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term ''information technology'' in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''; authors [[Harold Leavitt|Harold J. Leavitt]] and Thomas L. Whisler commented that "the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT)." Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of [[statistical]] and mathematical methods to [[decision-making]], and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs.&lt;ref name="LeavittWhisler"&gt;{{citation |title=Management in the 1980s |url=http://hbr.org/1958/11/management-in-the-1980s |last1=Leavitt |first1=Harold J. |last2=Whisler |first2=Thomas L. |journal=Harvard Business Review |year=1958 |volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as [[television]] and telephones. Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology, including [[computer hardware]], software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, [[telecommunications equipment|telecom equipment]], and [[e-commerce]].&lt;ref name="DMC"&gt;{{citation |last1=Chandler |first1=Daniel |last2=Munday |first2=Rod |contribution=Information technology |title=A Dictionary of Media and Communication |edition=first |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nLuJz-ZB828C&amp;pg=PA211 |quote = Commonly a synonym for computers and computer networks but more broadly designating any technology that is used to generate, store, process, and/or distribute information electronically, including television and telephone. |access-date=1 August 2012 |subscription=yes|isbn=978-0199568758 |date=2011-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|On the later more broad application of the term IT, Keary comments: "In its original application 'information technology' was appropriate to describe the convergence of technologies with application in the broad field of data storage, retrieval, processing, and dissemination. This useful conceptual term has since been converted to what purports to be concrete use, but without the reinforcement of definition&amp;nbsp;... the term IT lacks substance when applied to the name of any function, discipline, or position."{{sfnp|Ralston|Hemmendinger|Reilly|2000|p=869|ps=none}}}}

Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development: pre-mechanical (3000&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– 1450&amp;nbsp;AD), mechanical (1450–1840), [[electromechanical]] (1840–1940), and electronic (1940–present).&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; This article focuses on the most recent period (electronic), which began in about 1940.

==History of computer technology==
[[File:Z3 Deutsches Museum.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Z3 (computer)|Zuse Z3]] replica on display at [[Deutsches Museum]] in [[Munich]]. The Zuse Z3 is the first computer [[computer programming|programmable]] computer.]]
{{main|History of computing hardware}}

[[Machine|Devices]] have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, probably initially in the form of a [[tally stick]].&lt;ref name="Schmandt-Besserat"&gt;{{citation |last=Schmandt-Besserat |first=Denise |title=Decipherment of the earliest tablets |journal=Science |year=1981 |volume=211 |issue=4479 |pages=283–85 |doi=10.1126/science.211.4479.283 |pmid=17748027 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Antikythera mechanism]], dating from about the beginning of the first century BC, is generally considered to be the earliest known mechanical [[analog computer]], and the earliest known geared mechanism.{{sfnp|Wright|2012|p=279|ps=none}} Comparable geared devices did not emerge in Europe until the 16th century, and it was not until 1645 that the first [[mechanical calculator]] capable of performing the four basic arithmetical operations was developed.{{sfnp|Chaudhuri|2004|p=3|ps=none}}

[[Electronic computers]], using either [[relay]]s or [[valve]]s, began to appear in the early 1940s. The [[electromechanical]] [[Z3 (computer)|Zuse Z3]], completed in 1941, was the world's first [[computer programming|programmable]] computer, and by modern standards one of the first machines that could be considered a complete [[computing]] machine. [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], developed during the Second World War to decrypt [[Nazi Germany|German]] messages, was the first [[electronics|electronic]] [[Digital data|digital]] computer. Although it was [[Computer programming|programmable]], it was not general-purpose, being designed to perform only a single task. It also lacked the ability to store its program in memory; programming was carried out using plugs and switches to alter the internal wiring.{{sfnp|Lavington|1980|p=11|ps=none}} The first recognisably modern electronic digital [[stored-program computer]] was the [[Manchester Baby]], which ran its first program on 21 June 1948.&lt;ref name="Enticknap"&gt;{{citation |last=Enticknap |first=Nicholas |title=Computing's Golden Jubilee |journal=Resurrection |issue=20 |date=Summer 1998 |url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res20.htm#d |issn=0958-7403 |access-date=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of [[transistor]]s in the late 1940s at [[Bell Laboratories]] allowed a new generation of computers to be designed with greatly reduced power consumption. The first commercially available stored-program computer, the [[Ferranti Mark I]], contained 4050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts. By comparison the first transistorised computer, developed at the University of Manchester and operational by November 1953, consumed only 150 watts in its final version.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |doi=10.1049/esej:19980301 |last=Cooke-Yarborough |first=E.

Early electronic computers such as [[Colossus computer|Colossus]] made use of [[punched tape]], a long strip of paper on which data was represented by a series of holes, a technology now obsolete.{{sfnp|Alavudeen|Venkateshwaran|2010|p=178|ps=none}} Electronic data storage, which is used in modern computers, dates from World War II, when a form of [[delay line memory]] was developed to remove the clutter from [[radar]] signals, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line.{{sfnp|Lavington|1998|p=1|ps=none}} The first [[random-access memory|random-access]] digital storage device was the [[Williams tube]], based on a standard [[cathode ray tube]],&lt;ref name="Resurrection"&gt;{{citation |title=Early computers at Manchester University |journal=Resurrection |volume=1 |issue=4 |date=Summer 1992 |url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res04.htm#g |issn=0958-7403 |accessdate=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the information stored in it and delay line memory was volatile in that it had to be continuously refreshed, and thus was lost once power was removed. The earliest form of non-volatile computer storage was the [[drum memory|magnetic drum]], invented in 1932&lt;ref name="MagDrum"&gt;{{citation |url=http://cs-exhibitions.uni-klu.ac.at/index.php?id=222 |title=Magnetic drum |work=Virtual Exhibitions in Informatics |editor=Universität Klagenfurt |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used in the [[Ferranti Mark 1]], the world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer.&lt;ref name="Digital60MM1"&gt;{{citation |title=The Manchester Mark 1 |url=http://www.digital60.org/birth/manchestercomputers/mark1/manchester.html |publisher=University of Manchester |accessdate=24 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121112547/http://www.digital60.org/birth/manchestercomputers/mark1/manchester.html |archivedate=21 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM introduced the first [[hard disk drive]] in 1956, as a component of their [[IBM 305 RAMAC|305 RAMAC]] computer system.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Khurshudov |first=Andrei |title=The Essential Guide to Computer Data Storage: From Floppy to DVD |year=2001 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-130-92739-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} Most digital data today is still stored magnetically on hard disks, or optically on media such as [[CD-ROM]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Wang |first1=Shan X. |last2=Taratorin |first2=Aleksandr Markovich |title=Magnetic Information Storage Technology |year=1999 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-734570-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4–5}} Until 2002 most information was stored on [[analog device]]s, but that year digital storage capacity exceeded analog for the first time. As of 2007 almost 94% of the data stored worldwide was held digitally:&lt;ref name="USCNews"&gt;{{citation |last=Wu |first=Suzanne |title=How Much Information Is There in the World? |url=http://news.usc.edu/#!/article/29360/How-Much-Information-Is-There-in-the-World |work=USC News |publisher=University of Southern California |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 52% on hard disks, 28% on optical devices and 11% on digital magnetic tape.

====Databases====
{{main|Database}}

Database management systems emerged in the 1960s to address the problem of storing and retrieving large amounts of data accurately and quickly. One of the earliest such systems was [[IBM]]'s [[IBM Information Management System|Information Management System]] (IMS),{{sfnp|Ward|Dafoulas|2006|p=2|ps=none}} which is still widely deployed more than 50 years later.&lt;ref name="IMS"&gt;{{citation |last=Olofson |first=Carl W. |title=A Platform for Enterprise Data Services |date=October 2009 |publisher=[[International Data Corporation|IDC]] |url=http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/data/sw-library/ims/idc-power-of-ims.pdf |access-date=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMS stores data [[Hierarchical database model|hierarchically]],{{sfnp|Ward|Dafoulas|2006|p=2|ps=none}} but in the 1970s [[Edgar F. Codd|Ted Codd]] proposed an alternative relational storage model based on [[set theory]] and [[predicate logic]] and the familiar concepts of tables, rows and columns. The first commercially available [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS) was available from [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] in 1981.{{sfnp|Ward|Dafoulas|2006|p=3|ps=none}}

All database management systems consist of a number of components that together allow the data they store to be accessed simultaneously by many users while maintaining its integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BcOUCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Database+System+Concepts#v=onepage&amp;q=Database%20System%20Concepts&amp;f=false|title=Database System Concepts|last=Silberschatz|first=Abraham|date=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|isbn=9780077418007|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A characteristic of all databases is that the structure of the data they contain is defined and stored separately from the data itself, in a [[database schema]].{{sfnp|Ward|Dafoulas|2006|p=2|ps=none}}

The [[XML|extensible markup language]] (XML) has become a popular format for data representation in recent years. Although XML data can be stored in normal [[file system]]s, it is commonly held in [[relational database]]s to take advantage of their "robust implementation verified by years of both theoretical and practical effort".{{sfnp|Pardede|2009|p=2|ps=none}} As an evolution of the [[Standard Generalized Markup Language]] (SGML), XML's text-based structure offers the advantage of being both machine and human-readable.{{sfnp|Pardede|2009|p=4|ps=none}}

===Data retrieval===
The relational database model introduced a programming-language independent [[SQL|Structured Query Language]] (SQL), based on [[relational algebra]].

The terms "data" and "information" are not synonymous. Anything stored is data, but it only becomes information when it is organized and presented meaningfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kedar |first1=Seema |title=Database Management System |date=2009 |publisher=Technical Publications |isbn=9788184316049 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SELyJ4a5nTcC |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–9}} Most of the world's digital data is unstructured, and stored in a variety of different physical formats{{sfnp|van der Aalst|2011|p=2|ps=none}}{{efn|name=format|"Format" refers to the physical characteristics of the stored data such as its [[character encoding|encoding]] scheme; "structure" describes the organisation of that data.}} even within a single organization. [[Data warehouse]]s began to be developed in the 1980s to integrate these disparate stores. They typically contain data extracted from various sources, including external sources such as the Internet, organized in such a way as to facilitate [[decision support system]]s (DSS).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dyché |first=Jill |title=Turning Data Into Information With Data Warehousing |year=2000 |publisher=Addison Wesley |isbn=978-0-201-65780-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4–6}}

===Data transmission===
[[Data transmission]] has three aspects: transmission, propagation, and reception.{{sfnp|Weik|2000|p=361|ps=none}} It can be broadly categorized as [[broadcasting]], in which information is transmitted unidirectionally downstream, or [[telecommunications]], with bidirectional upstream and downstream channels.{{r|HilbertLopez2011}}

XML has been increasingly employed as a means of data interchange since the early 2000s,{{sfnp|Pardede|2009|p=xiii|ps=none}} particularly for machine-oriented interactions such as those involved in web-oriented [[communications protocol|protocols]] such as [[SOAP]],{{sfnp|Pardede|2009|p=4|ps=none}} describing "data-in-transit rather than&amp;nbsp;... data-at-rest".{{sfnp|Pardede|2009|p=xiii|ps=none}}  One of the challenges of such usage is converting data from relational databases into XML [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lewis |first=Bryn |contribution=Extraction of XML from Relational Databases |title=XML-Based Data Management and Multimedia Engineering&amp;nbsp;– EDBT 2002 Workshops |year=2003 |editor1-first=Akmal B. |editor1-last=Chaudhri |editor2-first=Chabane |editor2-last=Djeraba |editor3-first=Rainer |editor3-last=Unland |editor4-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Lindner |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3540001300}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|228–31}}

===Data manipulation===
Hilbert and Lopez identify the exponential pace of technological change (a kind of [[Moore's law]]): machines' application-specific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months between 1986 and 2007; the per capita capacity of the world's general-purpose computers doubled every 18 months during the same two decades; the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months; the world's storage capacity per capita required roughly 40 months to double (every 3 years); and per capita broadcast information has doubled every 12.3 years.{{r|HilbertLopez2011}}

Massive amounts of data are stored worldwide every day, but unless it can be analysed and presented effectively it essentially resides in what have been called data tombs: "data archives that are seldom visited".{{sfnp|Han|Kamber|Pei|2011|p=5|ps=none}} To address that issue, the field of [[data mining]]&amp;nbsp;– "the process of discovering interesting patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data"{{sfnp|Han|Kamber|Pei|2011|p=8|ps=none}}&amp;nbsp;– emerged in the late 1980s.{{sfnp|Han|Kamber|Pei|2011|p=xxiii|ps=none}}

==Perspectives==

===Academic perspective===
In an academic context, the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] defines IT as "undergraduate degree programs that prepare students to meet the computer technology needs of business, government, healthcare, schools, and other kinds of organizations&amp;nbsp;.... IT specialists assume responsibility for selecting hardware and software products appropriate for an organization, integrating those products with organizational needs and infrastructure, and installing, customizing, and maintaining those applications for the organization’s computer users."&lt;ref name="curricula"&gt;The Joint Task Force for Computing Curricula 2005.[http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report (pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021153204/http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf |date=21 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial and employment perspective===
Companies in the information technology field are often discussed as a group as the "tech sector" or the "tech industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Technology Sector Snapshot|url=http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/markets/usmarkets/sectors.asp?sector=57|accessdate=12 January 2017|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our programmes, campaigns and partnerships |url=https://www.techuk.org/focus|publisher=TechUK |access-date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberstates 2016|url=https://www.comptia.org/resources/cyberstates-2016|publisher=CompTIA|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Defining ICT in a Boundaryless World: The Development of a Working Hierarchy"&gt;{{citation |last=Zuppo |first=Colrain M. |title=Defining ICT in a Boundaryless World: The Development of a Working Hierarchy |publisher=International Journal of Managing Information Technology (IJMIT) |page=19 |url=http://www.airccse.org/journal/ijmit/papers/4312ijmit02.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a business context, the [[Information Technology Association of America]] has defined information technology as "the study, design, development, application, implementation, support or management of computer-based [[information system]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Proctor |first=K. Scott |title=Optimizing and Assessing Information Technology: Improving Business Project Execution |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-118-10263-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2017}} The responsibilities of those working in the field include network administration, software development and installation, and the planning and management of an organization's technology life cycle, by which hardware and software are maintained, upgraded and replaced.

The business value of information technology lies in the automation of business processes, provision of information for decision making, connecting businesses with their customers, and the provision of productivity tools to increase efficiency.

===Ethical perspectives===
{{main|Information ethics}}
The field of information ethics was established by mathematician [[Norbert Wiener]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bynum |first=Terrell Ward |contribution=Norbert Wiener and the Rise of Information Ethics |title=Information Technology and Moral Philosophy |year=2008 |editor1-last=van den Hoven |editor1-first=Jeroen |editor2-last=Weckert |editor2-first=John |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-85549-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} Some of the ethical issues associated with the use of information technology include:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Reynolds |first=George |title=Ethics in Information Technology |year=2009 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-538-74622-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20–21}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2382">[[File:Koflerbank.jpg|thumb|Kofler bench with samples for calibration]]
A '''Kofler bench''' or '''Kofler hot-stage microscope''' is a metal strip with a temperature gradient (range room temperature to 300°C). Any substance can be placed on a section of the strip revealing its thermal behaviour at the temperature at that point.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reichertms.com/Manuals/Galen%20III%20Thermo%20Galen%20brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

This melting-point apparatus for use with a microscope was developed by the Austrian pharmacognosist [[Ludwig Kofler]] (30 November 1891 [[Dornbirn]] - 23 August 1951 [[Innsbruck]]) and his wife Adelheid Kofler. In 1936, the Koflers and Mayrhofer published their ''"Mikroskopische Methoden in der Mikrochemie"'' [Kofler, L., A. Kofler and Mayrhofer, A. (1936)], Kofler and Kofler published their ''"Thermomikromethoden"'' [Kofler L., and A. Kofler (1954)] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.modernmicroscopy.com/main.asp?article=69&amp;page=12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=r__FmMNS7qIC&amp;pg=PA360&amp;lpg=PA360&amp;dq=Ludwig+Kofler+(1891-1951)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2jBdrqjpej&amp;sig=i0LmwlKQoQspBaS3HqE7RDXDi6M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_WyUTM6DCsvKswa8waVb&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ludwig%20Kofler%20(1891-1951)&amp;f=false History of Pharmacy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kofler, his wife Adelheid, and their colleague, Maria Kuhnert-Brandstätter, investigated numerous organic molecules, and published some 250 papers describing their work.&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.acs.org/action/doSearch?action=search&amp;searchText=Kofler&amp;qsSearchArea=searchText&amp;type=within&amp;publication=40025988&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermomicroscopy, incepted by Ludwig and Adelheid Kofler and developed further by Maria Kuhnert-Brandstätter (1919-) and [[Walter McCrone|Walter C. McCrone]] is a technique for studying the phases of solid drug substances.

This '''list of fictional gynoids''' is sorted by media genre and alphabetised by character name or media title. [[Gynoid]]s are [[humanoid robot]]s that are gendered feminine. They appear widely in science fiction film and art. They are also known as female androids, female robots or fembots, although some media have used other terms such as robotess, cyberdoll, "skin-job", or [[Replicant]]. Although there are a variety of gynoids across genres, this list excludes female [[cyborgs]] (e.g. [[Seven of Nine]] in ''Star Trek: Voyager''), non-humanoid robots (e.g. EVE from ''[[Wall-E]]''), virtual female characters ([[List of ReBoot characters#Dot Matrix|Dot Matrix]] and women from the cartoon ''[[ReBoot]]'', Simone from [[Simone (2002 film)|''Simone'' (2002 film)]], Samantha from ''[[Her (film)|Her]]''), holograms ([[Hatsune Miku]] in concert, [[Cortana (Halo)|Cortana from ''Halo'']]), non-robotic [[haunted doll]]s, and general [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial intelligence network systems]] ([[SAL 9000]], [[GLaDOS]] from ''[[Portal (video game series)|Portal]]'') Gynoids for Japanese manga and anime are grouped separately.

An '''MOS-controlled thyristor (MCT)''' is a voltage-controlled fully controllable [[thyristor]]. It was invented by V.A.K. Temple.&lt;ref&gt;V.A.K. Temple, "MOS-Controlled Thyristors, IEEE Electron Devices Meeting, Abstract 10.7, pp.282-285, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; MCTs are similar in operation to [[GTO (thyristor)|GTO thyristor]]s, but have voltage controlled insulated gates. They have two [[MOSFET]]s of opposite conductivity types in their equivalent circuits. One is responsible for turn-on and the other for turn-off. A thyristor with only one MOSFET in its equivalent circuit, which can only be turned on (like normal [[Silicon controlled rectifier|SCRs]]), is called an '''MOS-gated thyristor'''.

[[File:MOSFET Controlled Thyristor.JPG|thumb|Schematic of a MOSFET-controlled thyristor]]

'''Positive voltage''' on the gate terminal with respect to the cathode turns the thyristor to the on state.

'''Negative voltage''' on the gate terminal with respect to the anode, which is close to cathode voltage during the on state, turns the thyristor to the off state.

These devices proved unwanted current crowding when fabricated, consequently small SOA (safe operating area),&lt;ref&gt;B. Jayant Baliga, Advanced High Voltage Power Device Concepts, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, Sep 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; so [[Fairchild Semiconductor|Fairchild]] withdrew them after brief commercialization.

The '''Malaysian Electronic Payment System''' ('''MEPS''') is an [[interbank network]] service provider in [[Malaysia]]. In August 2017, MEPS has merged with Malaysian Electronic Clearing Corporation Sdn Bhd (MyClear) to form Payments Network Malaysia Sdn Bhd (PayNet).

With the result of the merger, PayNet is now the holding company for the PayNet Group which comprises two main subsidiaries, namely Malaysian Electronic Payment System Sdn Bhd (MEPS) and MEPS Currency Management Sdn Bhd (MCM). The PayNet Group is Malaysia's premier payments network and central infrastructure for financial markets.

Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) is PayNet's single largest shareholder, with eleven Malaysian's financial institutions namely, Malayan Banking Berhad, RHB Bank Berhad, Public Bank Berhad, CIMB Bank Berhad, AmBank (M) Berhad, Hong Leong Bank Berhad, Affin Bank Berhad, Alliance Bank Malaysia Berhad, Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad, Bank Muamalat Malaysia Berhad and Bank Kerjasama Rakyat Malaysia Berhad, as joint shareholders.

MEPS plays the integral role in the implementation of [[smart card]]s for [[automated teller machine]] (ATM) cards, which are an upgrade to chip-based cards from previous magnetic-stripe cards issued to all banks' customers.

The card is also known as ''Bankcard'', a card with multiple functions.  There are three main functions that can be used, namely ATM (with various combinations of banking transactions), e-debit (online purchase payment) transactions at participating merchants and MEPS Cash (a [[stored-value card]] that can be used to pay at participating merchants).

MEPS is a member of the [http://www.asianpaymentnetwork.com/ Asian Payment Network] (APN).

==Role==
In brief, MEPS’ role encompasses:
* Development and implementation of payment services
* Provision and management of shared infrastructure for participating financial institutions
* Operating [[e-payment]] clearing and settlement systems for the financial industry
* Governing adherence to relevant standards
* Developing technical standards and specifications for the Smart Card
* Certification services for payment smart card and personalisation centres

MEPS provide the following services through its network to all participating banks:
* '''Nationwide Shared ATM Network''' – An interbank switching infrastructure network for routine banking transactions including cash withdrawal, funds transfer, credit card and loan repayment, account balance inquiry, mobile prepaid top-up, MEPS CASH loading and Touch n’ Go top-up
* '''Cross-Border Initiative''' – A cross-border ATM network and link with six countries; providing inter-country cash withdrawal services and will be expanded to include inter-country funds transfer and balance enquiry
* '''Regional Switching for Financial Institutions''' – Provision of ATM switching services for member banks amongst their regional branches
* '''MEPS ATM''' – Deployment of white-label ATMs which are owned and managed by MEPS. The ATMs offer services ranging from domestic and cross-border cash withdrawal, domestic balance enquiry and funds transfer. Cardholders of participating banks in Malaysia have access to these ATMs while cash advance facilities for MasterCard and Visa cardholders would be enabled soon
* '''Payment Multi-Purpose Card Specification (PMPC)''' – A proprietary ATM and Debit chip-card standard which was developed by MEPS. MEPS is the central coordinating body for the national implementation of the PMPC and is responsible for developing the PMPC chip card specification, technical standards, technical integration, support and coordination. MEPS is upgrading the PMPC standard to become EMV compliant and renamed as Malaysian Chip Card Specification (MCCS).

The '''Mileševa printing house''' ({{lang-sr|Милешевска штампарија}}) was a printing house established in 1544 in the [[Mileševa monastery]] near [[Prijepolje]], [[Ottoman Empire]] (modern day [[Serbia]]). Three [[srbulje]] books were printed in this printing house. Two in 1544 and 1545 and one in 1557.

== Background ==
Activities connected with printing in Mileševa began when in 1518 or at the beginning of 1519 when Teodor Ljubavić, who was a [[hieromonk]] of Mileševa, travelled to [[Venice]] to learn printing skills. Ljubavić worked at [[Goražde printing house]] between 1521 and 1523. Between 1533 and 1535 [[Božidar Vuković]] visited Mileševa and concluded an agreement with Mileševa to distribute his books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Recherches sur l'art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NqGfAAAAMAAJ|year=1991|publisher=Matica|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Establishing ==
In 1543 Todor Ljubojević, a monk in Mileševa and son of Božidar, was sent to Venice to join his brother Đurađ and to buy a printing press for the monastery. He was accompanied by Mileševa monk Sava and by [[Hegumen Mardarije|Mardarije]] who was a [[hegumen]] of the [[Banja Monastery]] near [[Priboj]]. At that time Banja Monastery was a seat of the [[metropolitan bishop]] while Mileševa was the richest monastery of Dabar eparchy. That is why those two monasteries were given the task to finance and organize establishing of the printing house in Mileševa and why Mardarije travelled to Venice together with monks from Mileševa.&lt;ref name="Biblioteka1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Biblioteka|first=Matica srpska (Novi Sad, Serbia).|title=Godïsnjak Biblioteke Matice srpske|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0i9JAQAAIAAJ|year=1994|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mileševa printing house was operational in period 1544—1557.&lt;ref name="AćimovićĐorđević1987"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aćimović|first1=Dragoljub|last2=Đorđević|first2=Milivoje|title=Štamparstvo u Užičkom kraju, 1537-1987: povodom 450 godina Rujanske štamparije|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LRXhAAAAMAAJ|year=1987|publisher=Dimitrije Tucović|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three books were printed in it, [[Psalter]] (Псалтир, 1544), [[Breviary]] (Требник, 1545) and another Psalter (1557).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ćirilske rukopisne knjige Biblioteke Matice srpske: Psaltir Gavrila Trojičanina iz 1643. godine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmPgAAAAMAAJ|year=1992|publisher=Biblioteka Matice srpske|page=8&lt;!-- |quote=Псалтир с последовањем (Милешева 1544), Псалтир са синаксаром, часловцем и неким канонима (Милешева 1557... --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ŠafárikBoškov1963"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Šafárik|first1=Pavel Jozef|authorlink1=Pavel Jozef Šafárik|last2=Boškov|first2=Živojin|title=P.J.

The '''Misznay–Schardin effect''' (alternative spelling Misnay–Schardin), or platter effect, is a characteristic of the detonation of a broad sheet of [[explosive]]. The explosive blast expands directly away from and [[perpendicular]] to the surface of an explosive. Unlike the blast from a rounded explosive charge, which expands in all directions, the blast produced by an explosive sheet expands primarily perpendicular to its plane, in both directions. However, if one side is backed by a heavy or fixed mass, most of the blast (that is, most of the rapidly expanding gas and its kinetic energy) will be sent in the direction away from the mass.&lt;ref&gt;''Practical Bomb Scene Investigation'', James T. Thurman, CRC, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;23)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unterm.un.org/DGAACS/unterm.nsf/8fa942046ff7601c85256983007ca4d8/09b8ba4b58acd55a85256d0300502440?OpenDocument Misznay Schardin effect] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085745/http://unterm.un.org/DGAACS/unterm.nsf/8fa942046ff7601c85256983007ca4d8/09b8ba4b58acd55a85256d0300502440?OpenDocument |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect was studied and experimented with by explosive experts József Misznay (alternative spelling Misnay), a [[Hungary|Hungarian]], and [[Hubert Schardin]], a [[Germany|German]], who initially sought to develop a more effective anti-tank (AT) mine for [[Nazi Germany]]. Some sources claim [[World War II]] ended before their design became usable, but they and others continued their work.&lt;ref&gt;''Ragnar's Action Encyclopedia'', [[Ragnar Benson]], Paladin, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;70&lt;/ref&gt; Misznay designed two weapons: The 43 M was an AT mine, the LŐTAK was a side-attack mine. The Hungarian army used these weapons in 1944–1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haditechnika.hu/ARCHIVUM/198604/860401.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120220622/http://www.haditechnika.hu/Archivum/198604/860401.htm |archivedate=2007-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Japan]] has a nationwide system of {{Nihongo|'''national highways'''|一般国道|Ippan Kokudō}} distinct from the [[Expressways of Japan|expressways]]. The [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism]] and other government agencies administer the national highways. Beginning in 1952, Japan classified these as Class 1 or Class 2. Class 1 highways had one- or two-digit numbers, while Class 2 highways had three-digit numbers. For example, Routes [[Route 1 (Japan)|1]] and [[Route 58 (Japan)|58]] were Class 1 highways while [[Route 507 (Japan)|507]] (the one with the highest number) was a Class 2 highway.

A 1964 amendment to the governing law resulted in a unification of the classes, which took effect in April of the following year. Highways numbered since that time have had three-digit numbers, so the numbers 58–100, which had so far been unused, remained unused. However, when [[Okinawa Prefecture]] was reverted to Japanese control in 1972, Route 58, with its southern endpoint in Okinawa's capital city of [[Naha, Okinawa|Naha]], was established. The numbers from 59 to 100 remain unused. Some other numbers have been vacated by the joining or changing of routes: 109 (joined with 108), 110 (renumbered as 48), 111 (renumbered as 45), 214–216 (joined to form 57).

'''PolyMorphic Systems''' was a manufacturer of microcomputer boards and systems based on the [[S-100 bus]].  Their products included the Poly-88 and the System 8813.  The company was incorporated in California in 1976 as Interactive Products Corporation [[Doing business as|d/b/a]] PolyMorphic Systems.  It was initially based in [[Goleta, California|Goleta]], then [[Santa Barbara, California]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

==S-100 boards==
PolyMorphic Systems' first products were several interface boards based on the then-popular [[S-100 bus]].  These were compatible with other microcomputers such as the [[Altair 8800]] and [[IMSAI 8080]].  The first was an [[Analog-to-digital converter|A/D]] and [[Digital-to-analog converter|D/A]] converter board. This was followed by a video terminal interface (VTI) card which became the primary display device for their systems.  Later board-level products included [[Central processing unit|CPU]], [[Random-access memory|RAM]], and [[disk controller]] cards.

==Poly-88==
[[File:PolyMorphic Systems Poly-88.jpg|thumb|120px|PolyMorphic Systems Poly-88 microcomputer chassis.]]
With the release of their CPU card, PolyMorphic began selling complete systems.  Their first was the Poly-88, housed in a 5-slot S100 chassis, with additional side-mounted S-100 connectors for the purpose of joining chassis together.&lt;ref name=ditlea1979&gt;{{cite book|last=Ditlea|first=Steve|title=A Simple Guide to Home Computers|pages=152–153|year=1979|publisher=A&amp;W Publishers, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-89104-109-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This unit earned the nickname "orange toaster" due to its orange metal cover, and the fact that the S-100 cards generated noticeable heat.&lt;ref name=s100comp&gt;[http://www.s100computers.com/Hardware%20Folder/PolyMorphic/History/History.htm "PolyMorphic Systems History"] -- S100 Computers&lt;/ref&gt;  The Poly-88 was available in kit form, or assembled.  It was originally called the Micro-Altair, but after objections from [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]], manufacturers of the Altair, the name was changed.&lt;ref name=allan2001&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Roy A.|title=A History of the Personal Computer: The People and the Technology|at=p.4-14|year=2001|publisher=Allan Publishing|location=London, Ontario, Canada|isbn=0-9689108-0-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLabRYnGrOcC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardware===
The Poly-88 board set consisted of the following:

* '''Central Processing Unit (CPU)''' with an [[Intel 8080]] chip, and an [[8251]] [[USART]] for serial communication to a modem, printer, or cassette tape interface. The cassette tape interface supported program storage and loading from consumer-grade cassette tape recorders, using either [[Kansas City standard]] or higher speed [[Manchester code|Manchester]] encoded signals. The board contained 512 bytes of RAM and one 1024-byte [[Read-only memory|ROM]].
* '''Video Terminal Interface (VTI)''' which produced a 16-line display of 64 characters per line.  The VTI was intended to drive a television using an [[RF modulator]], or to be connected directly to a TV monitor's [[composite video]] input (not commonly available in the 1970s). The VTI also displayed low-resolution graphics (today called [[text semigraphics]]).  Each character position was divided into a grid 2 dots wide and 3 high, giving a graphics resolution of 128 horizontal and 48 vertical pixels, the same as the original [[TRS-80]]. A [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]]-level, [[Parallel communication|parallel]] keyboard interface was also included on the VTI.  Several keyboards were available, including the Keyboard III which included a numeric keypad.
* '''Random Access Memory (RAM)''' cards were also available, with capacities ranging from 8,192 (8K) bytes up to 56K (the maximum supported in their system architecture).  Since the systems were based on the S-100 bus, other manufacturers' memory card could be used in Poly systems as well.

===Software===
The Poly-88 ROM contained a [[Booting|boot loader]] program, capable of reading programs from the cassette tape interface. Available programs included games, utilities, a [[BASIC]] [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]], and an [[Assembly language|8080 assembler]].

==System 8813==
[[File:PolyMorphic Systems 8813.jpg|thumb|PolyMorphic Systems diskette-based System 8813.]]
PolyMorphic's disk-based system was the System 8813.  It consisted of a larger chassis holding one, two, or three 5{{1/4}}-inch minifloppy disk drives from [[Shugart Associates]].  The drives used single-sided, single-density storage on [[Hard sectoring|hard-sectored]] diskettes.  Storage capacity was approximately 90K bytes per diskette.

===Hardware===
System 8813 hardware included the standard CPU and VTI cards; a RAM card, typically with at least 32K of memory; and a disk controller card, to interface with the minifloppy drives.  Later, a [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] based disk controller supported double sided, double-density minifloppy drives, and full-size (8-inch) floppy drives.

===Software===
The Poly disk operating system was called '''Exec'''.  The three disk drives were distinguished by numbers enclosed in angle brackets such as '''&lt;1&gt;''', rather than the drive letter convention ('''A:''') used by CP/M and later [[MS-DOS]].  File names were [[Case sensitivity|case-sensitive]] and could contain up to 31 characters including a two-character extension.  For example, a text file might be named '''Notes.TX'''.

Various file extensions had predefined meanings: .GO for executable files, .BS for BASIC programs, .OV for overlays.  [[Overlay (programming)|Overlays]] were used extensively to provide more code space for the operating system.  If a file named '''INITIAL.TX''' was present when the system booted, commands listed in that file were executed automatically, similar to the [[AUTOEXEC.BAT]] file of an MS-DOS system.

Later versions of Exec supported subdirectories.  The naming syntax continued to use angle brackets.  For example, a file in a second-level subdirectory on drive 2 might be named '''&lt;2&lt;Projects&lt;Dan&lt;Accounts.TX'''.  Unlike MS-DOS and [[Unix]], no explicit [[mkdir|"make directory"]] command was needed.  When a program tried to create a file within a subdirectory, that subdirectory would be automatically created (if it didn't already exist).

System 8813 software included an 8080 [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] [[Assembly language|assembler]] and a BASIC interpreter for program development.  Poly BASIC used [[Binary-coded decimal|BCD]] arithmetic for high precision in financial applications.  A word-processing system, named WordMaster, consisted of a text editor and separate formatter program.  [[Stuart Woods]] wrote his second novel, ''[[Run Before the Wind]]'', using WordMaster on a PolyMorphic 8813 system.&lt;ref name=woods1983&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Stuart|title=Run Before the Wind|nopp=y|page=A Technical Note|year=1983|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=0-451-21594-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Products==

===System 8810===
With the introduction of double-sided, double density minifloppy drives, the storage capacity of a single floppy became approximately 360K bytes (the same as the original [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM-PC]] floppy drive capacity).  This made it feasible to store Exec, applications and data on a single floppy.  The System 8810 was functionally identical to the 8813, but in a smaller chassis, with 5 slots and only one minifloppy drive.

===Mass Storage===
The 88/MS (Mass Storage) was a cabinet housing dual, 8-inch (full size) floppy drives.  It was available with either single- or double-sided disk drives, both using double-density recording on hard-sectored media.  The 88/MS could be added onto either an 8813 or 8810 system.  The largest Poly configurations would contain three mini-floppy drives and four full-size drives, with drive numbers from 1 to 7.

The 88/HD was a subsystem with an 18 MB [[SCSI|SASI]] hard drive, housed in an 8810 chassis.  Software called Volume Manager [[Disk partitioning|partitioned]] the available space into several logical disk drives, similar to the [[FDISK]] partitioning command used by other operating systems.&lt;ref name=polyspg&gt;{{cite book|title=System 88 System Programmer's Guide|pages=233–234|url=http://www.hartetechnologies.com/manuals/PolyMorphic/System%2088%20System%20Programmers%20Guide.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TwinSystem===
The TwinSystem was marketed as "Get more work done on a computer built for two."  The System 8813 TwinSystem had an additional RAM card, video card, and keyboard.  [[Bank switching]] between the RAM cards allowed the CPU to keep two applications in memory simultaneously.  However, the TTL-level keyboard interface limited the distance between the two user stations to a few feet.

===CP/M Compatibility===
The dominant operating system for microcomputers in this era was [[CP/M]].  Unmodified Poly systems were unable to run CP/M, for several reasons:

*Hard-sectored floppy disks.  Nearly all CP/M systems used soft-sectored diskettes, so it was difficult to transport information between CP/M and Poly systems.
*Memory map.  CP/M required RAM from addresses 0000 to (ideally) FFFF hex.  The Poly CPU and VTI cards mapped ROM and video memory into the area between 0000 and 1FFF.

Late in the system's lifetime, hardware modifications were introduced to solve the memory map issues, and a version of CP/M was released for the 8813.

A '''Prontor-Compur''' connection (also known as a '''PC connector''', '''PC terminal''', or '''PC socket''') is a standard 3.5 mm (1/8") electrical connector (as defined in ISO 519&lt;ref name="ISO_519"&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=4581 ISO 519:1974], [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=4582 ISO 519:1992] (1992-11-25). ''Photography -- Hand-held cameras -- Flash-connector dimensions''. Geneva: International Organization for Standardization.&lt;/ref&gt;) used in photography to [[Flash synchronization|synchronize]] the [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]] to the [[Flash (photography)|flash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Manual of Photography: Photographic and Digital Imaging | first1=Norman | last1=Axford | isbn = 0-240-51574-9 | publisher = Focal Press | year = 2000 | url = https://books.google.com/books?visbn=1579905927&amp;id=u4rXBqSmjPAC&amp;pg=RA2-PA234|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[Image:Diaphragm shutter opening.jpg|thumb|right|A leaf shutter]]
"''Prontor''" has its origins in the Italian word "pronto", meaning ''ready'' (and was a [[leaf shutter]] made by {{Interlanguage link multi|Alfred Gauthier Calmbach|de|3=Alfred Gauthier Calmbach|lt=Alfred Gauthier}}).&lt;ref&gt;History of the Prontor company. http://www.prontor.de/go/unternehmen-firmengeschichte/english.html&lt;/ref&gt; "''Compur''" is derived from the word "compound" (the "''{{Interlanguage link multi|Compound (shutter)|de|3=Compound-Verschluss|lt=Compound}}''" was a long-lived series of leaf shutters made by {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich Deckel|de}}).

==History==
The term is derived from [[brand]]s of widely marketed photographic leaf shutters manufactured from the early 1950s by two distinct, but now defunct German companies. {{Interlanguage link multi|Alfred Gauthier Calmbach|de|3=Alfred Gauthier Calmbach|lt=Gauthier}} (which made the ''[[Prontor-S]]'' and ''[[Prontor SV]]'' models, amongst others) and {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich Deckel|de|3=Friedrich Deckel|lt=Deckel}} (the ''[[Synchro-Compur]]'' model, successor to the ''Compound'' model).

Both companies' brands, ''Prontor'' (from 1953) and ''Compur'' (from 1951), shared a common 1/8"-inch coaxial connector for shutter/flash synchronization. This convergence of design is not as coincidental as it might first appear, owing to the fact that the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss organisation]] held a significant shareholding in both of these companies prior to the introduction of the shared connector.&lt;ref&gt;History of flash photography. http://www.photomemorabilia.co.uk/Ilford/Flash_History.html&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1950s, Gauthier were manufacturing up to 10,000 ''Prontor'' shutters daily.

The Gauthier company's essence lives on as {{Interlanguage link multi|Prontor GmbH|de}}, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of {{Interlanguage link multi|VTC Industrieholding GmbH|de|3=VTC Industrieholding}}.&lt;ref&gt;Timeline of Prontor company. http://www.prontor.de/go/unternehmen-firmengeschichte/english.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Deckel company went bankrupt in 1994.

'''Reactive armour''' is a type of [[vehicle armor|vehicle armour]] that reacts in some way to the impact of a weapon to reduce the damage done to the vehicle being protected. It is most effective in protecting against [[shaped charge]]s and specially hardened [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s. The most common type is ''explosive reactive armour'' (ERA), but variants include ''self-limiting explosive reactive armour'' (SLERA), ''non-energetic reactive armour'' (NERA), ''non-explosive reactive armour'' (NxRA), and electric reactive armour. NERA and NxRA modules can withstand multiple hits, unlike ERA and SLERA, but a second hit in exactly the same location may potentially penetrate any of those.

Essentially all anti-tank munitions work by piercing the armour and killing the crew inside, disabling vital mechanical systems, or both. Reactive armour can be defeated with multiple hits in the same place, as by [[tandem-charge]] weapons, which fire two or more [[shaped charge]]s in rapid succession. Without tandem charges, hitting the same spot twice is much more difficult.

==History==
[[File:IDET2007 reactive armor DYNA.jpg|thumb|right|Reactive armour "DYNA" for T-72 MBT]]

The idea of counterexplosion (''kontrvzryv'' in Russian) in armour was first proposed by the Scientific Research Institute of Steel (NII Stali) in 1949 in the USSR by academician [http://www.prometeus.nsc.ru/eng/science/schools/voitsekh/ Bogdan Vjacheslavovich Voitsekhovsky]{{failed verification|date=November 2017}}
(1922–1999). The first pre-production models were produced during the 1960s. However, insufficient theoretical analysis during one of the tests resulted in all of the prototype elements being blown up.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} For a number of reasons, including the accident, as well as a belief that Soviet tanks had sufficient armour, the research was ended. No more research was conducted until 1974 when the Ministry of the Defensive Industry announced a contest to find the best tank protection project.

A West German researcher, Manfred Held carried out similar work with the [[Israeli defence force|IDF]] in 1967–69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-TtpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=Israel's+Clandestine+Diplomacies+MANFRED+HELD&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hmAx-J-DRN&amp;sig=5Q-zQU9yxOFn60BOqmWU9vbvs-Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXmcyY37XUAhXHDxoKHVypARQQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Israel's+Clandestine+Diplomacies+MANFRED+HELD&amp;f=false|title=Israel's Clandestine Diplomacies|first1=Clive|last1=Jones|first2=Tore T.|last2=Petersen|date=1 November 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactive armour created on the basis of the joint research was first installed on Israeli tanks during the [[1982 Lebanon war]] and was judged very effective.{{bywhom|date=June 2017}}

== Explosive reactive armour ==
[[File:Indian Army T-90.jpg|thumb|left|The advanced [[Kontakt-5]] explosive reactive armour on this [[T-90]]S is arranged in pairs of plates, giving the turret its prominent triangular profile.]]

[[File:IDET2007 reactive armor detail2.jpg|thumb|right|Reactive armour detail]]

[[File:Image Explosive Reactive Armor.png|thumb|right]]

An element of explosive reactive armour consists of a sheet or slab of high explosive sandwiched between two plates, typically metal, called the reactive or dynamic elements. On attack by a penetrating weapon, the explosive detonates, forcibly driving the metal plates apart to damage the penetrator. Against a shaped charge, the projected plates disrupt the metallic jet penetrator, effectively providing a greater path-length of material to be penetrated. Against a kinetic energy penetrator, the projected plates serve to deflect and break up the rod.

The disruption is attributed to two mechanisms.  First, the moving plates change the effective velocity and angle of impact of the shaped charge jet, reducing the angle of incidence and increasing the effective jet velocity versus the plate element.  Second, since the plates are angled compared to the usual impact direction of shaped charge warheads, as the plates move outwards the impact point on the plate moves over time, requiring the jet to cut through fresh plate material.  This second effect significantly increases the effective plate thickness during the impact.

To be effective against kinetic energy projectiles, ERA (Explosive Reactive Armour) must use much thicker and heavier plates and a correspondingly thicker explosive layer.  Such "heavy ERA," such as the Soviet-developed [[Kontakt-5]], can break apart a penetrating rod that is longer than the ERA is deep, again significantly reducing penetration capability.

An important aspect of ERA is the [[brisance]], or detonation speed of its explosive element.  A more brisant explosive and greater plate velocity will result in more plate material being fed into the path of the oncoming jet, greatly increasing the plate's effective thickness. This effect is especially pronounced in the rear plate receding away from the jet, which triples in effective thickness with double the velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Held|first1=Manfred|title=Dr.|journal=Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics|date=20 Aug 2004|volume=29|issue=4|page=245|doi=10.1002/prep.200400051|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prep.200400051/pdf|accessdate=20 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERA also counters explosively forged projectiles, as produced by a shaped charge.  The counter-explosion must disrupt the incoming projectile so that its momentum is distributed in all directions rather than towards the target, greatly diminishing its effectiveness.

Explosive reactive armour has been valued by the [[Soviet Union]] and its now-independent component states since the 1980s, and almost every tank in the eastern-European military inventory today has either been manufactured to use ERA or had ERA tiles added to it, including even the [[T-55]] and [[T-62]] tanks built forty to fifty years ago, but still used today by reserve units. The U.S. Army uses reactive armour on its Abrams tanks as part of the TUSK (Tank Urban Survivability Kit) package and on Bradley vehicles and the Israelis use it frequently on their American built [[M60 Patton|M60]] tanks.

ERA tiles are used as add-on (or "appliqué") armour to the portions of an [[armoured fighting vehicle]] that are most likely to be hit, typically the front ([[glacis]]) of the hull and the front and sides of the turret. Their use requires that a vehicle be fairly heavily armoured to protect itself and its crew from the exploding ERA.

A further complication to the use of ERA is the inherent danger to anyone near the tank when a plate detonates, disregarding that a [[high explosive anti-tank warhead|high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) warhead explosion would already cause great danger to anyone near the tank. Although ERA plates are intended only to bulge following detonation, the combined energy of the ERA explosive, coupled with the kinetic or explosive energy of the projectile, will frequently cause explosive fragmentation of the plate. The explosion of an ERA plate creates a significant amount of shrapnel, and bystanders are in grave danger of fatal injury. Thus, infantry must operate some distance from vehicles protected by ERA in combined arms operations.

== Non-explosive and non-energetic reactive armour ==

NERA and NxRA operate similarly to explosive reactive armour, but without the explosive liner.  Two metal plates sandwich an inert liner, such as rubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defense-update.com/features/du-1-04/feature-armor-protection.htm |title=Protection Systems For Future Armored Vehicles |accessdate=2008-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830004857/http://defense-update.com/features/du-1-04/feature-armor-protection.htm |archive-date=2008-08-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When struck by a shaped charge's metal jet, some of the impact energy is dissipated into the inert liner layer, and the resulting high pressure causes a localized bending or bulging of the plates in the area of the impact.  As the plates bulge, the point of jet impact shifts with the plate bulging, increasing the effective thickness of the armour.  This is almost the same as the second mechanism that explosive reactive armour uses, but it uses energy from the shaped charge jet rather than from explosives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220060011057%22.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20060011057&amp;RS=DN/20060011057 Non-explosive energetic material and a reactive armour element using same], US Patent Application 20060011057, accessed August 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the inner liner is non-explosive, the bulging is less energetic than on explosive reactive armour, and thus offers less protection than a similarly-sized ERA.  However, NERA and NxRA are lighter, safe to handle, safer for nearby infantry, can theoretically be placed on any part of the vehicle, and can be packaged in multiple spaced layers if needed. A key advantage of this kind of armour is that it cannot be defeated via tandem warhead shaped charges, which employ a small forward warhead to detonate ERA before the main warhead fires.

== Electric reactive armour ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}
A new technology called ''electric reactive armour'' (also termed ''electromagnetic reactive armour'', or colloquially as ''electric armour'') is in development. This armour is made up of two or more conductive plates separated by an air gap or by an insulating material, creating a high-power [[capacitor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2002/08/54641 U.S. Military Uses the Force] (Wired News)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,539143,00.html 'Star Trek' shields to protect supertanks] (The Guardian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3298279/Electric-armour-vaporises-anti-tank-grenades-and-shells.html 'Electric armour' vaporises anti-tank grenades and shells - Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.armedforces-int.com/news/electrified_vehicle_armour_could_deflect_weapons.html |title=Electrified Vehicle Armour Could Deflect Weapons |access-date=2011-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927154713/http://www.armedforces-int.com/news/electrified_vehicle_armour_could_deflect_weapons.html |archive-date=2011-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.defense-update.com/features/du-1-04/passive-armor.htm |title=Advanced Add-on Armor for Light Vehicles |access-date=2007-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015043314/http://www.defense-update.com/features/du-1-04/passive-armor.htm |archive-date=2007-10-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In operation, a high-voltage power source [[Electric charge|charges]] the armour. When an incoming body penetrates the plates, it closes the [[Electrical network|circuit]] to discharge the capacitor, dumping a great deal of energy into the penetrator, which may vaporize it or even turn it into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], significantly diffusing the attack. It is not public knowledge whether this is supposed to function against both kinetic energy penetrators and shaped charge jets, or only the latter. This technology has not yet been introduced on any known operational platform. 

Another electromagnetic alternative to ERA uses layers of plates of electromagnetic metal with silicone spacers on alternate sides. The damage to the exterior of the armour passes electricity into the plates causing them to magnetically move together. As the process is completed at the [[speed of electricity]] the plates are moving when struck by the projectile causing the projectile energy to be deflected whilst the energy is also dissipated in parting the magnetically attracted plates.

== Directed energy reactive armour ==

Some active protection systems, like the German [[AMAP-ADS]] or the American [[Iron Curtain (countermeasure)|Iron Curtain]], have explosive modules that destroy projectiles with a directed energy explosion. This type of explosive module is similar in concept to the classic ERA, but without the metal plates and with directed energy explosives. The composition materials of the explosive modules are not public. The designer of the AMAP-ADS claims that his AMAP-ADS systems are effective against [[Explosively formed penetrator|EFP]] and [[Armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot|APFSDS]].

==Early life and education==

Carpenter was born in [[Des Moines, Iowa]] on February 4, 1934. She grew up in several Midwestern cities and then in [[Short Hills, New Jersey]]. In 1952, Carpenter graduated from the [[Morristown-Beard School|Beard School]] in [[Orange, NJ]] (now Morristown-Beard School). She then completed her bachelor's degree in literature at [[Smith College]] in [[Northampton, MA]] in 1956.&lt;ref name="philly" /&gt; Carpenter co-chaired a reception of the Smith College Clubs of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] to launch the $125 million fundraising campaign for the school in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | title=Autry, Young Glitter at Jewel Gala V | date=16 October 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information technology career==

In the 1960s, Carpenter joined [[IBM]] as a [[systems engineer]], instructor, and sales representative. She was the first woman to take on all three of these roles at the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Smith Alumni Quarterly | date = 2006 | volume = 92 | number =2 | title = Obituaries: Sandra Mitchell Carpenter | url = http://saqonline.smith.edu/winter2005/files/smith_w05_web.pdf | page = 89 | accessdate = 31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenter later served as director of [[information systems]] at Quanex Corp., an industrial company in [[Houston, Texas]], and chief information officer at Rosenbluth Travel in [[Philadelphia]] during the 1990s.

Rosenbluth, the fifth largest travel agency in the U.S. at the time, had a corporate client list that included [[Walmart]], [[DuPont]], [[Nike, Inc.]], and [[Chevron Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | title=Little Travel Agency That Could; Rosenbluth's Key to Growth Is Corporate Business | date=16 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; (After its 2003 acquisition by [[American Express]], Rosenblauth's operations now work as the American Express Business Travel division.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesstravelnews.com/More-News/Amex-Completes-Rosenbluth-Integration/?a=btn Amex Completes Rosenbluth Integration]&lt;/ref&gt;) Carpenter led the [[automation]] of Rosenblauth's booking system, which had previously relied on  manual entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=CIO magazine | year=1992 | volume=5 | number=8 | title=Electronic Bookings: Windows on the World}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1992 profile of her work written by ''CIO'' magazine, Carpenter outlined five critical elements for IT innovation at Rosenblauth:

* Staff Nurturing Programs
* Contact between Information Systems and Customers
* Team Decision-Making
* Concurrent Development Methods
* Toleration for Failures &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=CIO magazine | volume=5 | issue=11 | title=The Mad Doctor of Corporate Travel | year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service work==

Carpenter founded the first [[woman's shelter]] in the [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] suburbs. She helped organize the Michigan chapter of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) and served as the founding president of NOW's [[Oakland County, MI|Oakland County]] chapter. in 1975, the [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]] chapter of NOW awarded Carpenter their Feminist of the Year Award.&lt;ref name="philly" /&gt;

==Family==

After her college studies, Sandra Carpenter married Nick de Kuyper and moved to Europe to live with de Kuyper. They had one son, John. They divorced in 1961. In 1964, Sandra Carpenter married widower Robert Carpenter. She adopted his four children: Robert, John, Kristin and Charles. Sandra Carpenter and Robert Carpenter divorced in 1980.&lt;ref name="philly" /&gt;

'''Sha-Mail''' ({{nihongo2|写メール}}) is a kind of mailing service of [[J-Phone]] (now [[Softbank]]).  This term is made from Sha, which is the front part of a Japanese word ''Shashin'' meaning photograph, and Mail.  Sha-Mail is used to send pictures and/or email through mobile handsets.

The term came into usage after Softbank (then Vodafone) introduced the service in November, 2000. 

In current usage, sha-mail refers not only to Softbank, but has come to apply to all the mobile phone carriers, as well as to mail with accompanying picture sent via other hand held devices and PCs. The term has come to mean not only mail with pictures attached, but is also sometimes used to refer to the pictures themselves that have been taken with [[camera phone]]s and other such devices. It can be abbreviated to sha-me ({{nihongo2|写メ}})

'''Spatial organization''' can be observed when components of an [[abiotic]] or biological group are arranged non-randomly in space. '''Abiotic''' patterns, such as the ripple formations in [[Dune|sand dunes]] or the oscillating wave patterns of the [[Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ball |first=P |title=The Self-Made Tapestry: Pattern formation in nature |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-850244-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; emerge after thousands of particles interact millions of times. On the other hand, individuals in '''biological groups''' may be arranged non-randomly due to selfish behavior, [[Dominance hierarchy|dominance]] interactions, or [[Cooperation|cooperative]] behavior. [[W. D. Hamilton]] (1971) proposed that in a non-related "[[herd]]" of animals, spatial organization is likely a result of the selfish interests of individuals trying to acquire food or avoid [[predation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Hamilton | first =W.D. | authorlink =W.

==Spatial organization in eusocial insects==
[[File:Paint marked ants.JPG|thumb|175px| '''Spatial patterns''' exhibited by ants (''Temnothorax rugatulus'') can be determined after each individual is painted with a distinguishing mark.]]
Individuals in a '''[[Eusociality|social insect]]''' colony can be '''spatially organized''', or arranged non-randomly inside the nest. These miniature territories, or '''spatial fidelity zones''' have been described in [[honey bee]]s (''Apis mellifera''&lt;ref name=seeley1982&gt;{{cite journal | last =Seeley | first =T.

While residing in these zones, workers perform the [[Task allocation and partitioning of social insects|task]] appropriate to the area they reside. For example, individuals that remain in the center of an ant nest are more likely to feed larvae, whereas individuals found at the periphery of the nest are more likely to forage.&lt;ref name=powell1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=sendova1995/&gt; [[E. O. Wilson]] proposed that by remaining in small, non-random areas inside the nest, the distance an individual moves between tasks may be minimized, and overall colony efficiency would increase.&lt;ref name=wilson1976/&gt;

===Spatial organization in the nest===

===="Foraging-for-work"====
There are a variety of ways in which individuals can divide space inside a nest. According to the '''“foraging-for-work” hypothesis''', adult workers begin performing [[Task allocation and partitioning of social insects|tasks]] in the area of the nest where they emerged, and gradually move towards the periphery of the nest as demands to perform particular tasks change. This hypothesis is based on two observations: "(1) that there is spatial structure in the layout of tasks in social insect colonies and (2) that workers first become adults in or around the center of the nest".&lt;ref name=franks1994&gt;{{cite journal | last = Franks| first =NR | authorlink = |author2=Tofts, C. | year = 1994| title =Foraging for work: how tasks allocate workers | journal =Animal Behaviour | volume = 48| issue = 2| pages =470–472 | doi = 10.1006/anbe.1994.1261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals can remain in an area for an extended period of time, as long as tasks need to be performed there. Over time, an individual’s zone may shift as tasks are accomplished and workers search for other areas where tasks need to be performed. [[Honey bee]]s, for example, begin their adult life caring for brood located in the area near where they emerged (i.e. nurse bees). Eventually, workers move away from the brood rearing area and begin to perform other tasks, such as food storage, guarding, or foraging.&lt;ref name=seeley1982/&gt;

====Dominance hierarchy====
[[File:Polistes flavus on the nest.JPG|thumb|175px| The '''dominant''' paper wasp (''Polistes flavus'') remains in the center of the nest while subordinate wasps are often at the edge or off the nest.]]
Space inside the nest may also be divided as a result of '''[[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]]''' interactions. For example, in [[paper wasp]] colonies, a single inseminated queen may found (initiate) a colony after waking up from hibernation (overwintering). However, it is common in many species that multiple inseminated females join these foundresses instead of founding their own nest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Insect Societies |last=Wilson |first=E. O.|authorlink=E. O. Wilson |year= 1971|publisher= Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When multiple inseminated females found a colony together, the colony grows quickly, yet only one individual will become the primary egg-layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = [[Mary Jane West-Eberhard|West-Eberhard]]| first =M. J. | authorlink = | year =1969 | title =The social biology of Polistine wasps | journal = Miscellaneous Publications Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan| volume = 140| issue = | pages =1–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a series of dominance interactions, the most aggressive wasp will emerge as the dominant individual and will become the primary egg-layer for the group (the prime role for ensuring your genes are passed on to subsequent generations), whereas the remaining subordinate wasps will perform other tasks, such as nest construction or foraging.&lt;ref name=robson2000/&gt; There is evidence that these dominance interactions affect the spatial zones individuals occupy as well. In [[paper wasp]]s (''Ropalidia revolutionalis''), as well as in the ant species ''Odontomachus brunneus'',&lt;ref name=powell1999/&gt; dominant individuals are more likely to reside in the central areas of the nest, where they take care of brood, while the subordinate individuals are pushed towards the edge, where they are more likely to forage. It is unknown whether division of space or establishment of dominance occurs first and if the other is a result of it.

===Spatial organization outside the nest===
[[File:Marked Bumble bees.jpg|thumb|175px|left| Bumble bees, ''Bombus impatiens'' individually marked with plastic number tags]]
There is also evidence that foragers, which are the insects that leave the nest to collect the valuable resources for the developing colony, can divide space outside the nest. Makino &amp; Sakai showed that [[bumblebee|bumble bee]] foragers maintain '''foraging zones''' in flower patches, which means that bees consistently return to the same areas within a patch and there is little overlap between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Makino | first = TT| authorlink = |author2=Sakai, S | year =2004 | title =Findings on spatial foraging patterns of bumblebees (''Bombus ignitus'') from a bee-tracking experiment in a net cage | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology| volume =56 | issue = 2| pages =155–163 | doi =10.1007/s00265-004-0773-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These zones can expand and contract when neighboring foragers are removed or introduced, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Makino | first =TT, | authorlink = |author2=Sakai, S. | year = 2005| title =Does interaction between bumblebees (''Bombus ignitus'') reduce their foraging area?: Bee-removal experiments in a net cage | journal =Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume =57 | issue = 6| pages =617–622 | doi =10.1007/s00265-004-0877-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By dividing foraging patches into miniature ‘foraging territories’, individuals can maximize the number of flowers visited with minimal interruptions or competition between foragers. These ‘foraging territories’ divided among individuals from the same colony are the result of [[self-organization]] among the foragers; that is, there is no lead forager dictating where the bees will forage. Instead, the maintenance of these foraging zones is due to simple rules followed by each individual forager. Studies to determine these “rules” are an important area of research in [[computer science]], basic [[biology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[Mathematical model|mathematic modeling]].

===Spatial organization as an emergent property of a self-organized system===

The '''[[self-organization]]''' observed in foraging territories is a microcosm for the self-organization seen in the entire [[Eusociality|colony]]. Spatial organization observed across social insect colonies can be considered an '''[[emergence|emergent]]''' property of a '''[[Self-organization|self-organized]]''' '''[[complex system]]'''. It is self-organized because there is no leader dictating where each individual will reside, nor which task an individual will perform once they get there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Self-Organization in Biological Systems|last= Camazine|first= S. |author2=Deneubourg, J.-L. |author3=Franks, N. R. |author4=Sneyd, J. |author5=Theraulaz, G. |author6=Bonabeau, E. |year= 2001|publisher= Princeton University Press|location=Princeton |isbn= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, zones may be a by-product of [[Task allocation and partitioning of social insects|division of labor]], whereby individuals end up in a particular location for a period of time based on the task they perform,&lt;ref name=franks1994/&gt; or dominance interactions, whereby dominant individuals are granted access to the most desirable places inside the nest.&lt;ref name=powell1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=robson2000/&gt; Spatial patterns exhibited by individuals of social insect colonies are not obvious, because it is difficult to observe and differentiate among individuals inside a nest cavity or flying across a foraging patch. However, when careful attention is given to the individual worker, the spatial organization of workers in the nest becomes apparent.

'''Spinplasmonics''' is a field of [[nanotechnology]] combining [[spintronics]] and [[plasmonics]]. The field was pioneered by Professor Abdulhakem Elezzabi at the [[University of Alberta]] in [[Canada]]. In a simple  spinplasmonic device, light waves couple to [[Spin quantum number|electron spin]] states in a metallic structure. The most elementary spinplasmonic device consists of a bilayer structure made from magnetic and nonmagnetic metals. It is the nanometer scale interface between such metals that gives rise to an electron spin phenomenon. The plasmonic current is generated by optical excitation and its properties are manipulated by applying a weak magnetic field. Electrons with a specific spin state can cross the interfacial barrier, but those with a different spin state are impeded. Essentially, switching operations are performed with the electrons spin and then sent out as a light signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-birth-of-spinplasmonics/|title=The birth of spinplasmonics {{!}} ZDNet|last=Piquepaille|first=Roland|date=2007-05-31|work=ZDNet|access-date=2018-10-10|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20181010002844/https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-birth-of-spinplasmonics/|archive-date=2018-10-09|dead-url=no|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2007-06-spinplasmonics-nanotechnology-field.html|title='Spinplasmonics': Researchers create new nanotechnology field|last=|first=|date=2007-06-15|work=Phys.org|access-date=2018-11-04|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20181104191123/https://phys.org/news/2007-06-spinplasmonics-nanotechnology-field.html|archive-date=2018-11-04|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinplasmonic devices potentially have the advantages of high speed, miniaturization, low power consumption, and multifunctionality. On a lengthscale that is less than a single magnetic domain size, the interaction between atomic spins realigns the magnetic moments. Unlike semiconductor-based devices, smaller spinplasmonics devices are expected to be more efficient in transporting the spin-polarized electron current.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elezzabi|first=A.

A '''stirrup pump''' is a portable water pump used to extinguish or control small fires. It is operated by hand. The operator places a foot on a stirrup-like bracket at the bottom of the pump to hold the pump steady.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8529">The '''Sydney Accord''' is an international mutual recognition agreement for qualifications in the fields of [[engineering technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ieagreements.org/sydney/| title=The Sydney Accord| publisher=International Engineering Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and background==
The Sydney Accord is an agreement between the bodies responsible for [[accredit]]ing engineering technologist qualification programs in each of the signatory countries. 
It recognizes the substantial [[equivalency]] of programs accredited by those bodies, and recommends that graduates of accredited programs in any of the signatory countries be recognized by the other countries as having met the academic requirements for entry to the practice of engineering technologist. The Sydney Accord was signed in 2001.

==Scope==
The Sydney Accord covers '''engineering technologist''' qualifications.

The scope of the Sydney Accord only covers the ''academic'' requirement for an engineering technologist qualification.  Engineering technologist titles do not transfer directly between signatory countries that don't have reciprocating agreements, because the signatory countries reserve the right to scrutinize foreign titles and compare them to their own licensing criteria. However, this does not mean the titles are not respected by employers within those signatory countries.

The engineering technologist may be hired within a country by an employer where a formal license is not required. The ''industrial exemption'' clause negates formal engineering registration within the United States for those who meet the criteria.

Foreign titles may be utilized as a foundation for recognition of professional licensing.  The titles can be supplemented with additional experience and/or training to meet the local definition of formal registration.  This serves to underline that a foreign technologist covered under the accord does not arrive in a fellow signatory country without merit.  The Sydney Accord is therefore not a hollow agreement without advantages.

==Accord Enhancements==
The [[Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists]] (CCTT) and the United Kingdom's [[Institution of Incorporated Engineers]] (IIE) signed a reciprocating agreement of recognition for engineering technologist. In 2006, the IIE merged with the [[Institute of Electrical Engineers]] (IEE) to form the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET). The CCTT also signed a reciprocating agreement with the [[National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies]] (NICET).  NICET is a United States organization sponsored by the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] (NSPE).  The formal recognition of the CCTT as a common link between NICET and the IET has not been realized.

===Canada===
Canada has signed the Sydney Accord with the title of "Applied Science" and "Engineering Technologist".

The Canadian signatory body is the [[Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists]] (CCTT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=CCTT| title=National and International Mobility| url=http://www.cctt.ca/template.asp?id=66BCF9F972D1468B9286F72D20549DE1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This is different from the Canadian signatory of the [[Washington Accord]], [[Engineers Canada]].

In the case of all other Sydney Accord members, the same organization has signed both the Sydney Accord and the Washington Accord.

===Hong Kong===
Hong Kong originally signed the Sydney Accord with the title of "Science Technologist" and later abbreviated the title to "Technologist."

===United States===
The [[United States]] applied for recognition with the Sydney Accord in 2007 and was granted that status in 2009. Despite this achievement the United States still has significant confusion in defining a unified technologist registration for professionals. Part of the reason for this is that the engineering technology profession is not well defined as a separate profession (distinct from professional engineering) in the United States. This is because the NSPE has opposed legal registration of technologist by the United States government through a licensing program. The loss of government oversight has led to competing ideologies from societies with different perspectives on what represents the qualities of a technologist.

====Confusion====
Some legitimate societies and organizations that have established technology programs do not have clear representation in the accord. The [[Society of Manufacturing Engineers]] (SME), and the [[Society of Broadcast Engineers]] (SBE) are two organizations that have engineering technology and technician certifications that are respected and recognized but operate independently from the accord.  In addition to these societies there are legitimate accreditations that are unacknowledged.  They are the [[Distance Education and Training Council]] (DETC), the [[National Association of Industrial Technology]] (NAIT), the [[Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technology]] (ACCSCT), or other non-[[ABET]]/TAC institutions that are exclusively regionally accredited.  It is unclear if these organizations or societies will eventually be represented by a formal avenue of recognition in the Sydney Accord.

==Registrations==
As an international representative of the accord the UK offer a registration program for individuals from any country.  However, since the standards for technologist are higher in UK (B.Sc. and B.Eng. in Engineering) only 25 UK (emigrating) registrants up to this date applied for registration as "Technologist" indicating the failure of the Accord within UK.  In the UK the term "engineer", "professional engineer" or "engineering" have no meaning in law so anyone can call themselves a professional engineer, or technologist without restrictions. However the titles "Chartered Engineer", "Incorporated Engineer" and "Engineering Technician" awarded by The Engineering Council (UK) are protected by law. United States' graduates may apply for a peer review by the [[Engineering Council UK]] if they belong to one of the organizations or societies that are not explicitly mentioned as a member of the accord.  Individuals that graduate from a regionally accredited technology program are likely to receive acceptance through professional engineering registration as an Incorporated Engineer.

U.S. professional registration is a [[U.S. state|state]] concern. While the profession of engineering technologist is not specifically recognised, many states provide engineering technologists with a pathway towards ''Professional Engineer (PE)'' licensing that bypasses national engineering requirements. This is opposed by the national regulatory and representative bodies for professional engineers, the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE). Notably, the Washington Accord does not apply to American PEs who have obtained this status through a technologist route.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3093">The '''Tucker Telephone''' is a [[torture]] device designed using parts from an old-fashioned [[telephone magneto|crank telephone]].  The [[electric generator]] of the telephone is wired in sequence to two dry cell batteries so that the instrument can be used to administer electric shocks to another person.  The Tucker Telephone was invented by Dr. A. E. Rollins,&lt;ref name=Murton&gt;Murton T. Prison doctors. In: Visscher MB, ed. ''Humanistic Perspectives in Medical Ethics.'' Buffalo, NY: Prometheus Books; 1972: 248-249&lt;/ref&gt; the resident physician at the [[Tucker State Prison Farm]], [[Arkansas]], in the 1960s.

At the Tucker State Prison Farm, an inmate would be taken to the "hospital room" where he was most likely restrained to an examining table and two wires would be applied to the prisoner. The ground wire was wrapped around the big toe and the "hot wire" (the wire that administers the current of electricity) would be applied to the genitals. The crank on the phone would then be turned, and an electric current would shoot into the prisoner's body. Continuing with the telephone euphemisms, 'long-distance calls' referred to several such charges, just before the point of losing consciousness. Often the victim would experience detrimental effects, mainly permanent organ damage and mental health problems. Its use was substantiated until 1968.&lt;ref name=Inciardi&gt;James Inciardi, Criminal Justice, Seventh Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are scattered reports from American [[Vietnam War]] veterans that field phones were occasionally converted into Tucker Telephones which were used by platoon commanders to torture [[Viet Cong]] prisoners.&lt;ref name=rejali&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Darius Rejali|Rejali, Darius M.]]|title=Torture and Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L8QLvrX-iL0C&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=tucker+telephone+in+vietnam#PPA191,M1|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2007|pages= 191–92|isbn=0-691-11422-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of the device is used on a prisoner in the [[Robert Redford]] film ''[[Brubaker]].''

A 1974 report by Seth B. Goldsmith, SCD noted "The Tucker telephone not only shocked the penises of the allegedly uncooperative and incorrigible prison-farm inmates of the Arkansas penal system, but it shocked the consciousness of the nation and awakened it to the atrocious conditions inside prisons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=1434688|year=1974|author1=Goldsmith|first1=S.

A '''Wet-bottom furnace''' or '''wet-bottom boiler''' is [[boiler]] that contains a wet bottom furnace. It is a kind of boiler used for [[pulverised fuel firing]].
In wet bottom boiler the bottom ash is kept in a molten state and tapped off as a liquid. Wet bottom boiler slag is the molten condition ash as it is drawn from the bottom of the slag-tap or cyclone furnaces.
An advantage is the fact that the end product in this process has a higher value compared to that of a [[dry bottom boiler]]. Wet bottom boilers are preferred for [[Volatility (chemistry)|low volatile coals]] that produce a lot of ash. But it has higher investment costs and higher maintenance costs, so it is built less often.

==Wet-bottom boilers==
# Slag-tap boiler, burns pulverized coal. 50 percent of the ash is retained in the furnace as boiler slag.
# Cyclone boiler, burns crushed coal. 70 to 80 percent of the ash is retained as boiler slag. The rest of the ash leaves as [[fly ash]].

If the ash fusion temperature is less than the furnace temperature then that type of furnace is called a wet bottom furnace.

==Steps in the process==
# Both boiler types have a solid base with an orifice that can be opened to permit the molten ash that has collected at the base to flow into the ash hopper below.
# The ash hopper in wet-bottom furnaces contains quenching water.
# When the molten slag comes in contact with the quenching water, it fractures instantly, crystallizes, and forms pellets.
# The resulting boiler slag, often referred to as “black beauty,” is a coarse, hard, black, angular, glassy material.
# At intervals, high-pressure water jets wash the boiler slag from the hopper pit into a sluiceway which is then conveys it to a collection basin for dewatering, possible crushing or screening, and either disposal or reuse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2623">'''William James''' (born 15 November 1854; died 16 February 1889) was a British [[engineer]], who worked in [[India]].

William James was son of Edward  James, J.P., of Greenbank House, [[Plymouth]]. He was educated at the nearby private school of Dr. P. Holmes, of Mannamead. From 1872, he served a pupilage of three years to S. W. Jenkin, during  which he was engaged in connection with the parliamentary and working plans and sections of several branch lines for the [[Cornwall Minerals Railway]], the [[Maritime Line|Fal Valley Railway]] and the [[Truro and Penzance Railway]]. For one year from 1875 to 1876, he was a student at the [[School of Practical Engineering]] at [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] under W. J. Wilson. In 1876 he went to India, however, failing to obtain employment as an engineer, he became a pupil of H. Whymper, of the [[Murree Brewery]], and was occupied for fifteen months on the water supply for the Murree Brewery Company in the Punjab.&lt;ref name="ICE"&gt;[https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/imotp.1890.20590 Minutes of the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers,] E-ISSN 1753-7843, Volume 99, Issue 1890, Part 1, 1890, pp. 376-377. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, he proceeded to [[Calcutta]], where he was engaged by [[Mitchell and Co.]], engineers and contractors, of which he became a partner in 1881. He was first employed in  building bungalows, machine-shops, engine-sheds for the [[Northern Bengal State Railway]] at [[Saidpore]], and afterwards, during the year 1879, was in charge of the construction of 10 miles of the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway|Darjeeling Steam Tramway]]. He was also concerned in the making of a road through the [[Teesta River|Teesta Valley]] and on the [[Bengal Central Railway]],  the Calcutta drainage works, the [[Dacca and Mymensing Railway]], and the [[Trams in India#Patna|Patna and Bankipore Tramway]].&lt;ref name="ICE"/&gt; 

During the last two years of his life he was the resident partner in the firm of [[Walsh, Lovett and Co.|Walsh, Lovett, Mitchell and Co.]], contractors for the [[Tansa Dam|Tansa]] water-works, for bringing a large supply of good water to the [[City of Bombay]]. During this time he had in the working season from six thousand to ten thousand men under his charge, but the anxiety arising from his responsibilities acting on a frame already much weakened by [[malaria|jungle fever]], was too much for him, and he died somewhat suddenly from heat apoplexy at [[Vasind]] on 16 February 1889, in his thirty-fifth year.&lt;ref name="ICE"/&gt;
