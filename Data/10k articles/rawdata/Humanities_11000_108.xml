'''Adela Catherine Breton''' (31 December 1849 – June 1923) was an English [[archaeological]] artist and explorer. She made [[watercolour]] copies of the wall paintings of [[Mexico|Mexican]] temples, notably those of the Upper Temple of Jaguars at [[Chichen Itza]].

==Biography==
Breton was born in [[London]] on 31 December 1849, to parents who were widely travelled. Her English father served in the [[Royal Navy]] and met Adela's mother (who was born in [[Somerset]], England) while in [[Tasmania]].&lt;ref name=McVicker1234&gt;McVicker, Chapter 1, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7TSs-hmJYYIC&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp 1–4]&lt;/ref&gt; They moved to [[Bath, Somerset]], a few months after Adela's birth and she grew up there.&lt;ref name=McVicker1234 /&gt; During her childhood the family spent time travelling through Europe, visiting France, Switzerland and Italy. Adela probably studied art while staying in [[Florence]].&lt;ref name=McVicker7to11&gt;McVicker, Chapter 2, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7TSs-hmJYYIC&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp 7–11]&lt;/ref&gt; With much of her time spent in Bath, with its Roman remains, the Bretons took a keen interest in the [[archaeology]].&lt;ref name=McVicker7to11 /&gt; She stayed in Bath to look after her parents in their old age but, after her father died in 1887, she decided to travel. She made a conscious decision not to marry, so she could remain independent and satisfy her wanderlust.&lt;ref name=Bathexhib2016&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/exhibition-celebrates-victorian-woman-left-bath/story-29194168-detail/story.html | title=Victorian woman who left Bath behind to document Maya ruins in Mexico is celebrated in exhibition | last=McFarlan | first=Tim | work=Bath Chronicle | date=28 April 2016 | access-date=1 May 2017 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; She initially headed for [[Canada]] (and the United States) where she painted the landscape, before returning to Bath to hold an exhibition of her paintings.&lt;ref name=McVicker13to17&gt;McVicker, Chapter 3, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7TSs-hmJYYIC&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp 13–17]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892 she made her first visit to Mexico. She hired a local guide, Pablo Solario.&lt;ref name=McVicker13to17 /&gt;

Her time in Mexico was spent travelling on horseback across the country, using her artistic skills to record the friezes, carvings and other archaeological treasures that were being unearthed in the [[Yucatán]].&lt;ref name=Bathexhib2016 /&gt; Her first trip lasted 18 months, when she travelled continually making notes and sketches.&lt;ref&gt;McVicker, Chapter 4, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7TSs-hmJYYIC&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp 19–20]&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1890s passed, Breton spent less time on return visits to England and more time on her travels in Mexico. Her observations became more scientific and broadened to include the geology, the canyons and volcanoes.&lt;ref&gt;McVicker, Chapter 6, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7TSs-hmJYYIC&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp 29–32]&lt;/ref&gt; However, she is particularly known for her colour paintings of the frescos discovered at [[Teotihuacan]] in 1894, at a site that became known as [[Teopancaxco]].&lt;ref&gt;McVicker, Chapter 7, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7TSs-hmJYYIC&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp 33–36]&lt;/ref&gt;

Breton's travels in Mexico were eventually curtailed by the [[Mexican revolution]] in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7TSs-hmJYYIC&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false McVicker, ''Adela Breton: A Victorian Artist Amid Mexico's Ruins'', back page]&lt;/ref&gt; She was recognised internationally in her lifetime for her valuable contribution to Mesoamerican archaeology.&lt;ref name=Bathexhib2016 /&gt;

She died in [[Barbados]] in 1923 age 73.&lt;ref name=Bathexhib2016 /&gt;

African-American women have been involved in American political issues and advocating for the community since the [[American Civil War]] era through organizations, clubs, community-based [[social services]], and advocacy. Issues that deal with [[Cultural identity|identity]], and [[misogynoir]] have been important to African-American women in the political dialogue.

==Suffrage and voting rights==
[[File:Sojourner truth c1870.jpg|thumb|150px|Sojourner Truth (c. 1870)]]
Efforts to attain [[universal suffrage]] began during the 1860s in response to the events of the American Civil War. It was [[Sojourner Truth]] who gave a historic speech during the Women's Convention in [[Akron, Ohio]], on May 29, 1851, that made many people stop and listen and was introduced to a wider audience when transcribed and published by Marius Robinson, an abolitionist reporter. The speech, "[[Ain't I A Woman?]]" discussed American white women's [[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]], and the courtesies that were not given to African-American women. While African-American men attained the vote in 1870 with the passage of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]], African-American women were still unable to participate in political elections. It was during the 1890s that women's suffrage efforts began. During the period, African-American women were widely minimized or ignored due to racism from white suffragists or general [[sexism]].&lt;ref name=Terborg-Penn&gt;{{cite book |last1=Terborg-Penn |first1=R |title=African American women in the struggle for the vote:1850–1920|publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1998 |location=Bloomington,IN |isbn= 978-0-253-33378-0 |oclc= 260107480|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though women obtained the right to vote in the United States in [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|1920]], many [[women of color]] still ran into obstacles. Some faced tests that required them to interpret the Constitution in order to vote.&lt;ref name=Terborg-Penn /&gt; Others were threatened with physical violence, false charges, and other extreme danger to prevent voting.&lt;ref name="Prescod"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Prescod |first1=M. |title=Shining in the Dark: Black Women and the Struggle for the Vote, 1955–1965|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=1997 |location=Amherst|isbn= 978-0-585-08352-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these tactics and others that marginalized people of color, the [[Voting Rights Act|Voting Rights Act of 1965]] was put into place. It outlawed any discriminatory acts to prevent people from voting.

==Women and Black Power==
Despite the fact that elements of the Black Power movement had some views centered on misogyny,&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williams|first1=R.Y. |year=2008 |title=Black Women and Black Power|journal=OAH Magazine of History |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=22–26 |doi=10.1093/maghis/22.3.22}}&lt;/ref&gt; African-American women quickly found a voice in the movement. Women held leadership positions, ran community-based programs, and fought misogyny.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt; Other women also contributed to the [[grass-roots movement]] through community service.&lt;ref name=Ogbonna&gt;{{citation |last1=Ogbonna|first1=J. |year=2005 |title=Black power: radical politics and african american identity|location=Baltimore |publisher= Johns Hopkins Univ Press |pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;"In the age of rights, antipoverty, and power campaigns, black women in community-based and often women-centered organizations, like their female counterparts in nationally known organizations, harnessed and engendered Black Power through their speech and iconography as participants of tenant councils, welfare rights groups, and a black female religious order."&lt;ref name=Williams2&gt;Williams, R.Y. (2006). ''Black women, urban politics, and engendering black power''. In P.E. Joseph (Ed.), ''The black power movement: Rethinking the civil rights-black power era.'' New York: Routledge. p.79-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Misogynoir in Politics ==
[[Misogynoir]] is misogyny directed towards black women where race and gender both play roles in bias. It was coined by queer Black feminist [[Moya Bailey]]. The term was created to tackle the misogyny directed toward black women in American visual and popular culture as well as in politics. In the U.S political sphere, misogynoir has led to the lack of African American Women in politics. The number of African-American elected officials has increased over the last four decades, however black people remain underrepresented at all levels of government. Black Women make up less than 3% of U.S. representatives and there are no black women in the U.S. Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Philpot|first=Tasha S.|last2=Walton|first2=Hanes|date=2007-01-01|title=One of Our Own: Black Female Candidates and the Voters Who Support Them|jstor=4122905|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=51|issue=1|pages=49–62|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00236.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to Black Man, Black Women tend to be more active participants in the electoral process and this could lead to more potential for Black Women to equal or surpass Black Men in the number of elected officials within their race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaba|first=Amadu Jacky|last2=Ward|first2=Deborah E.|title=African Americans and U.S. Politics: The Gradual Progress of Black Women in Political Representation|journal=The Review of Black Political Economy|volume=36|issue=1|pages=29–50|doi=10.1007/s12114-009-9036-4|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of issues of both race and gender it has been much harder for African-American Women to rise in the political sphere. When fighting for equal voting rights, Black Women found that they were often surrounded by sexist Black Men who did not want them to rise in power, and racist White Women who did not want them to be on the same level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/womens-suffrage-movement-politics-gender-race-and-class-cherryl-walker|title=The women's suffrage movement: The politics of gender race and class by Cherryl Walker|last=tinashe|date=2012-01-16|website=www.sahistory.org.za|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political representation==
African-American women have been underrepresented in politics within the United States, but numbers continue to increase. According to the [[Eagleton Institute of Politics#The Center for American Women and Politics|Center for American Women and Politics]] at [[Rutgers University]], currently 13 African-American women serve in the 112th Congress, with 239 state legislators serving nationwide.&lt;ref name=rutgers-woc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/fast_facts/women_of_color/FastFacts_AfricanAmericanWomeninOffice.php |title=Facts about women of color in elective office |year=2010 |publisher=Center for American Women and Politics |location=Rutgers, New Jersey |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928215545/http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/fast_facts/women_of_color/FastFacts_AfricanAmericanWomeninOffice.php |archivedate=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paths to public office for women in the African-American community have differed from men and other groups, such as women's organizations,&lt;ref name=Rosenthal&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenthal |first1=C.S. |year=1998 |title=Determinants of collaborative leadership: civic engagement, gender or organizational norms?|journal=Political Research Quarterly |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=847–868 |doi=10.1177/106591299805100401|hdl=11244/25274 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rallies, and fundraisers.

[[File:Shirley Chisholm.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Shirley Chisholm]] ran for president of the United States in 1972.]]
Though African-American women have run for presidential nomination in several campaigns, many have been labeled as "non-viable" due partly to their party affiliations, i.e., [[Charlene Mitchell]] in 1968 for the [[Communist Party USA]], [[Lenora Fulani]] in 1988 for the [[New Alliance Party]], and [[Cynthia McKinney]] in 2008 for the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]]. [[Shirley Chisholm]] ran as both the "black candidate" and the "woman candidate" in the 1972 presidential campaign and "found herself shunned by leaders from the political establishments she helped to found—the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] and the [[National Women's Political Caucus]]."&lt;ref name=Smooth&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smooth |first1=W.G. |year=2010 |title=Standing at the crossroads |journal=Crisis |volume=117 |issue=2 |pages=14–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Chisholm was able to gain 151 votes at the [[Democratic National Convention]], despite missing the presidential nomination.&lt;ref name=Smooth /&gt;

In 1993, [[Carol Moseley Braun]] became the [[African Americans in the United States Congress#United States Senate|first African American woman to be elected to the United States Senate]], and the only [[Women in the United States Senate#List of female senators|female senator]] from Illinois. Braun's original spark came from her anger at incumbent Democratic senator [[Alan Dixon]]'s vote to confirm [[Clarence Thomas]] after his 1991 [[sexual harassment]] scandal. Shortly after being elected, Braun took a one-woman stand against the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]]'s renewal of patent for the Confederate flag as their insignia.&lt;ref name=McCain&gt;{{citation |last1=McCain |first1=L. |year=1997|title=African American women in congress: forming and transforming history|location=New Jersey|publisher=Rutgers Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8135-2353-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Braun considered it a non-issue, she was still puzzled: "Who would have expected a design patent for the Confederate flag?"&lt;ref name=Clay&gt;{{citation |last1=Clay|first1=J.|year=2000|title=Rebels in law: voices in history of black women lawyers|location=Michigan|publisher=Univ of Michigan Press|pages=152|isbn=978-0-472-08646-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incredibly, Braun was able to sway the Senate vote against renewal of the patent. The [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] no longer uses the confederate flag as their insignia.

[[Condoleezza Rice]] became the first African-American woman to serve as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in the United States in 2005 under President [[George W. Bush]], she also became the first woman to serve as the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]]. She was known and widely criticized for her views on [[foreign policy]]&lt;ref name=Twilight&gt;"Cheney In Twilight", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', March 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and the American [[War in Iraq]].

Although not in political office, [[Michelle Obama]], the first African-American [[First Lady of the United States]], has made an impact on women in the 21st century. Obama became first Lady of the United States in 2009, when her husband, [[Barack Obama]], took office as President of the United States. Michelle Obama has donated her services to soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and other urban social services,&lt;ref name=Romano&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/30/AR2009033003332.html | title=Michelle's Image: From Off-Putting To Spot-On | accessdate=April 4, 2009|date=March 31, 2009|work=The Washington Post|author=Romano, Lois}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she eventually found her niche in [[childhood obesity]]. Ms. Obama has created [[Let's Move!]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://letsmove.gov/ Let’s Move!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820100201/http://www.letsmove.gov/ |date=August 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to reduce childhood obesity around the nation.&lt;ref name=Stolberg&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/us/14michelle.html|title=After a Year of Learning, the First Lady Seeks Out a Legacy |accessdate=July 25, 2010|date=January 14, 2010|page=A20|work=The New York Times|author=Stolberg, S.G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==

Another organization, the [[National Council of Negro Women]] (NCNW), was founded in 1935 by [[civil rights]] activist [[Mary McLeod Bethune]] and was more involved in African-American politics with the aim to improve the quality of life for African-American women and families. NCNW still exists today as a non-profit organization reaching out through research, advocacy, and social services in the United States and Africa.

In 1946 [[Mary Fair Burks]] founded the [[Women's Political Council]] (WPC) as a response to discrimination in the [[Montgomery League of Women Voters]], who refused to allow African-American women to join.&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ryan |first1=B |year=2001 |title=Identity politics in the women's movement |publisher=NYU Press |location=New York City |isbn= 978-0-8147-7479-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WPC sought to improve social services for the African-American community and is famously known for instigating the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]].&lt;ref name=Freedman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freedman |first1=R. |year=2006 |title=Freedom walkers: the story of the Montgomery bus boycott|location=New York |publisher=Holiday House |isbn=978-0-8234-2031-5|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the [[National Black Feminist Organization]] (NBFO) sought to address issues unique to African-American women such as racism, sexism, and classism. Though in previous years feminism and suffrage had been considered a white women's fight, NBFO "refused to make black women choose between being black and being female."&lt;ref name=Irvin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irvin |first1=N. |year=2006 |title=Creating black americans: african-american history and its meanings, 1619 to the present|location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-513755-2|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Sloan-Hunter]], one of its founders, went on to help found ''[[Ms. Magazine]]'', a magazine focusing on a feminist take on news issues. Though the organization had disintegrated by 1977, another organization, which formed just a year after the NBFO in 1974, turned out to be one of the most important black feminist organizations of our time. [[Combahee River Collective]] was founded by African-American feminist and lesbian, [[Barbara Smith]], and described themselves as a "collective of Black feminists [...] involved in the process of defining and clarifying our politics, while [...] doing political work within our own group and in coalition with other progressive organizations and movements."&lt;ref name=Smitha&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=B. |year=2000 |title=Home girls: a black feminist anthology|location=New Jersey|publisher=Rutgers Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8135-2753-6|pages=264–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most notable piece to come out of the Combahee River Collective was the Combahee River Collective Statement, which helped to expand on ideas about [[identity politics]].&lt;ref name=Kyungwon&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kyungwon|first1=G. |year=2006 |title=The ruptures of american capital: women of color feminism and the culture of immigrant labor|location=Amherst|publisher=Univ Of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-4635-7|page=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, political activist and women's rights leader Leslie Wimes founded the Democratic African-American Women's Caucus in Florida. She enlisted the help of Wendy Sejour and Mayor Daisy black to help African-American Women in the state of Florida have a voice.&lt;ref&gt;http://mywomenonthemove.com/tired-of-the-oscar-for-supporting-voter-role-floridas-democratic-african-american-women-take-the-lead/&lt;/ref&gt; In the last two presidential elections, the turnout percentage of African-American women was greater than all other demographic groups, yet has not translated into more African-American Women in office, or political power for African-American women. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe credits African-American Women for his win in the state.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/03/27/report-black-women-are-political-powerhouse-yet-remain-socially-vulnerable/&lt;/ref&gt; Black women-owned businesses are the fastest growing segment of the women owned business market.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/BWR.Final_Black_Women_in_the_US_2014Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The DAAWC seeks to increase the number of elected African-American Women on the State and Federal levels, as well as focus on issues specific to African-American Women. While the DAAWC begins in the state of Florida, the organization is hoping to expand to other states to mobilize the political power of African-American Women.

''''' Annunciation of Fano''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Pietro Perugino]], executed around 1488-1490, and housed in the church of  Santa Maria Nuova, [[Fano]], central Italy.

The work was successful, and a few years later he was commissioned to paint an altarpiece for the same church, the [[Fano Altarpiece]].

==Description==
The painting is set within a four bay portico, a common element in Perugino's paintings from the 1480s (as, for example, in the [[Albani-Torlonia Polyptych]] and the ''[[Pietà (Perugino)|Pietà]]''). Behind it, is a background with hills featuring light trees.

In the foreground is the [[Annunciation]], lit from the left. The angel, holding a white lily (symbol of purity), announces that she will bear Jesus; Mary, who was previously reading a book on a classical altar in front of her, has a surprised face. Behind them, in the upper center, is God in an oval with cherubim and seraphim, sending the Holy Spirit (portrayed as a dove) to her.

'''Architectural painting''' (also '''Architecture painting''') is a form of [[Genre art|genre painting]] where the predominant focus lies on architecture, both outdoors views and interiors. While architecture was present in many of the earliest paintings and illuminations, it was mainly used as background or to provide rhythm to a painting. In the Renaissance, architecture was used to emphasize the perspective and create a sense of depth, like in [[Masaccio]]'s ''[[Holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'' from the 1420s.

In Western art, architectural painting as an independent genre developed in the 16th century in Flanders and the Netherlands, and reached its peak in 16th and 17th century Dutch painting.&lt;ref name=Muller&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muller|first1=Sheila D.|title=Dutch Art: An Encyclopedia|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135495749|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPhLoy0FICMC&amp;pg=PA21 |chapter=Architectural painting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fredericksen|first1=Burton B.|title=Masterpieces of Painting in the J.

Closely related genres are architectural fantasies and trompe-l'oeils, especially [[illusionistic ceiling painting]], and [[cityscape]]s.

==Western artists specialized in architectural painting==

===16th century===
[[File:Hans Vredeman de Vries - Architectural Landscape - WGA25387.jpg|thumb|''Architectural landscape'' by [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]], now in the [[Hermitage Museum]]]]
The 16th century saw the development of architectural painting as a separate genre in Western art. The main centers in this period were Flanders and the Netherlands. The first important architectural painter was Dutch [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]] (1527-1607), who was both an architect and a painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waagen|first1=Gustav Friedrich|title=Handbook of Painting: The German, Flemish, and Dutch Schools.|date=1860|publisher=John Murray|page=245|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YatRAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students of Hans Vredeman de Vries, both in Flanders and in the Netherlands, include his sons Salomon and Paul, and [[Hendrik van Steenwijk I]]. Through them the genre was popularized and their family and students turned it into one of the main domains of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]].

'''Aspendos''' or '''Aspendus''' ([[Pamphylian Greek|Pamphylian]]: ΕΣΤϜΕΔΥΣ; [[Ancient Greek|Attic]]: Ἄσπενδος) was an [[ancient]] [[Greco-Roman]] city in [[Antalya province]] of [[Turkey]]. The site is located {{convert|7|km|mi}} northeast of central [[Serik]].

== History ==
[[File:Aspendos theatre from gallery.jpg|thumb|left|Aspendos theatre from the upper gallery]]

Aspendos was an ancient city in [[Pamphylia]], [[Asia Minor]], located about  40&amp;nbsp;km  east of the modern city of [[Antalya]], [[Turkey]]. It was situated on the [[Eurymedon River]] about 16&amp;nbsp;km  inland from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]; it shared a border with, and was hostile to, [[Side, Turkey|Side]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Burrell, ''Neokoroi: Greek Cities and Roman Emperors'' (Brill, 2004: {{ISBN|90-04-12578-7}}), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars associate the city's name with "Azatiwadaya". The known city of that name was founded by [[Azatiwada]] of [[Quwê]] on his ''eastern'' frontier, at [[Karatepe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Ilya Yakubovich |journal=Anatolian Studies |year=2015 |volume=65 |title=Phoenician and Luwian in Early Iron Age Cilicia |pages=35–53 |doi=10.1017/s0066154615000010}}, 50 from {{cite book|author=C. Brixhe |title=Le dialecte grec de Pamphylie: documents et grammaire |location=Paris |publisher=Maisonneuve | year=1976| pages=80, 193}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to later tradition, Aspendos was founded rather earlier by Greeks who may have come from [[Argos]].

The wide range of its coinage throughout the ancient world indicates that, in the 5th century BC, Aspendos had become the most important city in Pamphylia. At that time, according to [[Thucydides]], the Eurymedon River was navigable as far as Aspendos,&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Aspendus|volume=2|pages=766–767|first=David George|last=Hogarth|authorlink=David George Hogarth}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the city derived great wealth from a trade in salt, oil and wool.

Aspendos did not play an important role in antiquity as a political force. Its political history during the colonisation period corresponded to the currents of the [[Pamphylia]]n region. Within this trend, after the colonial period, it remained for a time under Lycian hegemony. In 546&amp;nbsp;BC it came under [[Persia]]n domination. The fact that the city continued to mint coins in its own name, however, indicates that it had a great deal of freedom even under the Persians.

Circa 465 BC [[Cimon]] led an Athenian navy against a Persian navy in the [[Battle of the Eurymedon]], and destroyed it. Aspendos then became a member of the [[Delian League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cheap-holidaystoturkey.com Holidays to Turkey info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111060105/http://cheap-holidaystoturkey.com/ |date=2012-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aqueduct of Aspendos 01.jpg|thumb|right|Aqueduct of Aspendos]]
The Persians captured the city again in 411&amp;nbsp;BC and used it as a base. In 389&amp;nbsp;BC Thrasybulus of [[Athens]], in an effort to regain some of the prestige that city had lost in the [[Peloponnesian Wars]], anchored off the coast of Aspendos in an effort to secure its surrender. Hoping to avoid a new war, the people of Aspendos collected money among themselves and gave it to the commander, entreating him to retreat without causing any damage. Even though he took the money, he had his men trample all the crops in the fields. Enraged, the Aspendians stabbed and killed Thrasybulus in his tent.

When [[Alexander the Great]] marched into Aspendos in 333&amp;nbsp;BC after capturing [[Perge]], the citizens sent envoys asking him not to garrison soldiers there. He agreed, provided he would be given the taxes and horses that they had formerly paid as tribute to the Persian king. After reaching this agreement Alexander went to [[Side, Turkey|Side]], leaving a garrison there on the city's surrender. Going back through Sillyon, he learned that the Aspendians had failed to ratify the agreement their envoys had proposed and were preparing to defend themselves. Alexander marched to the city immediately. When they saw Alexander returning with his troops, the Aspendians, who had retreated to their acropolis, again sent envoys to sue for peace. This time, however, they had to agree to very harsh terms; a Macedonian garrison would remain in the city and 100 gold talents as well as 4,000 horses would be given in tax annually.

In 190&amp;nbsp;BC the city surrendered to the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], and the corrupt magistrate [[Verres]] later pillaged its artistic treasures.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cicero|title=In Verrem II|pages=1. Chapter 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was ranked by [[Philostratus]] the third city of Pamphylia, and in [[Byzantine]] times seems to have been known as ''Primopolis''. Toward the end of the Roman period the city began a decline that continued throughout Byzantine times, although in medieval times it was evidently still a strong place.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Greek and Roman structures==
[[File:Aspendos Basilica Antalya Turkey.jpg|thumb|The Basilica]]
Aspendos is known for having the best-preserved theatre of antiquity. With a diameter of 96&amp;nbsp;metres (315&amp;nbsp;ft), it provided seating for 12,000.&lt;ref name=roth&gt;{{cite book | first=Leland M. | last=Roth | year=1993 | title=Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History and Meaning | edition=First | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder, CO | isbn=0-06-430158-3 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in 155&lt;ref name=roth/&gt; by the Greek architect Zenon, a native of the city. It was periodically repaired by the [[Seljuqs]], who used it as a [[caravanserai]], and in the 13th century the stage building was converted into a palace by the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm|Seljuqs of Rum]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Redford, "The Seljuqs of Rum and the Antique," ''Muqarnas'', Vol. 10, Essays in Honor of Oleg Grabar. (1993), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to keep with [[Hellenistic]] traditions, a small part of the theatre was built so that it leaned against the hill where the [[Citadel]] ([[Acropolis]]) stood, while the remainder was built on vaulted arches. The high stage, whose supporting columns are still in place,&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; served to seemingly isolate the audience from the rest of the world. The 'scaenae frons' or backdrop, has remained intact. The 8.1&amp;nbsp;metre (27&amp;nbsp;ft) sloping reflective wooden ceiling over the stage has been lost over time. Post holes for 58 masts are found in the upper level of the theatre. These masts supported a [[velarium]] or awning that could be pulled over the audience to provide shade.&lt;ref name=roth/&gt;

The Aspendos International Opera and Ballet Festival offers an annual season of productions in the theatre in the spring and early summer.

Nearby stand the remains of a [[basilica]], [[agora]], [[nymphaeum]] and 15&amp;nbsp;kilometres (9.3&amp;nbsp;mi) of a [[aqueduct (Roman)|Roman aqueduct]]. The Roman [[Eurymedon Bridge (Aspendos)|Eurymedon Bridge]], reconstructed in the 13th century, is also in the vicinity.

Aspendos was one of the earliest cities to mint coins. It began issuing coinage around 500&amp;nbsp;BC, first [[stater]]s and later [[drachma]]s; "the hoplite on the obverse represents the soldiery for which Aspendus was famous in antiquity,"&lt;ref&gt;''A Catalogue of the Greek Coins in the British Museum'' (British Museum. Dept. of Coins and Medals, 1897), p. lxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; the reverse frequently depicts a [[triskelion]]. The legend appears on early coins as the abbreviation ΕΣ or ΕΣΤϜΕ; later coinage has ΕΣΤϜΕΔΙΙΥΣ, the adjective from the city's local (Pamphylian) name Estwedus. The city's [[numismatics|numismatic]] history extends from archaic Greek to late Roman times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaminorcoins.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=264 Asia Minor Coins - Greek and Roman coins of Aspendos]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bishopric ==

The Christian [[bishopric]] of Aspendus was a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of [[Side, Turkey|Side]], the capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Pamphylia Prima]], to which Aspendus belonged. Of its bishops, the names of four are recorded in extant documents: Domnus was at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 425, Tribonianus at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431, Timotheus at the 448 synod held by [[Flavian of Constantinople]], which condemned [[Eutyches]], and at the [[Robber Council of Ephesus]] held the same year, and Leo at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0agp0mJFG_sC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 1001-1002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&amp;dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&amp;nbsp;450&lt;/ref&gt;

No longer a residential bishopric, Aspendus is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 840&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspendos International Opera and Ballet Festival==
{{Main|Aspendos International Opera and Ballet Festival}}
The theatre hosts the annual [[Aspendos International Opera and Ballet Festival]] organized by [[Turkish State Opera and Ballet]] since 1994, with international participation of opera and ballet companies and an audience of about 10,000.

[[Dalida]] held her last concert there on 28 April 1987.

'''Astroturfing''' is the practice of masking the [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]s of a message or organization (e.g., political, advertising, religious or [[public relation]]s) to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by [[grassroots]] participants. It is a practice intended to give the statements or organizations credibility by withholding information about the source's financial connection. The term ''astroturfing'' is derived from [[AstroTurf]], a brand of synthetic carpeting designed to resemble natural grass, as a play on the word "grassroots." The implication behind the use of the term is that instead of a "true" or "natural" grassroots effort behind the activity in question, there is a "fake" or "artificial" appearance of support.

==Definition==
In political science, it is defined as the process of seeking electoral victory or legislative relief for grievances by helping political actors find and mobilize a sympathetic public, and is designed to create the image of public consensus where there is none.&lt;ref name="Howard2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howard|first1=Philip N.|title=Digitizing the Social Contract: Producing American Political Culture in the Age of New Media|journal=The Communication Review|volume=6|issue=3|year=2003|pages=213–45|doi=10.1080/10714420390226270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Howard |first=Philip N. |date=2005 |title=New Media Campaigns and the Managed Citizen |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/american-government-politics-and-policy/new-media-campaigns-and-managed-citizen |location=New York, NY |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=93, 144 |isbn=9780521612272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astroturfing is the use of fake [[grassroots]] efforts that primarily focus on influencing public opinion and typically are funded by corporations and governmental entities to form opinions.&lt;ref name="ChoMartens2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cho|first1=Charles H.|last2=Martens|first2=Martin L.|last3=Kim|first3=Hakkyun|last4=Rodrigue|first4=Michelle|title=Astroturfing Global Warming: It Isn’t Always Greener on the Other Side of the Fence|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=104|issue=4|year=2011|pages=571–587|issn=0167-4544|doi=10.1007/s10551-011-0950-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Internet, astroturfers use software to mask their identity. Sometimes one individual operates through many personas to give the impression of widespread support for their client's agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Cory Doctorow, [http://boingboing.net/2011/02/18/hbgarys-high-volume.html "HBGary's high-volume astroturfing technology and the Feds who requested it"], ''boingboing'', February 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ludlow, [http://www.thenation.com/article/174851/strange-case-barrett-brown%23axzz2X9RMrDLN "The Strange Case of Barrett Brown"], ''The Nation'', June 18, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies suggest astroturfing can alter public viewpoints and create enough doubt to inhibit action.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Lyon and John W. Maxwell, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1430-9134.2004.00023.x/abstract;jsessionid=AC65BEC2EC9B443D3BBF57D9D1098593.f04t02?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage= "Astroturf: Interest Group Lobbying and Corporate Strategy"], 'Journal of Economics &amp; Management Strategy', October 13th, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the first systematic study of astroturfing in the United States, Oxford Professor [[Philip N. Howard]] argued that the internet was making it much easier for powerful lobbyists and political movements to activate small groups of aggrieved citizens to have an exaggerated importance in public policy debates.&lt;ref name="Howard2006"/&gt;

==Policies and enforcement==
Many countries have laws that prohibit more overt astroturfing practices.&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malbon|first1=Justin|title=Taking Fake Online Consumer Reviews Seriously|journal=Journal of Consumer Policy|volume=36|issue=2|year=2013|pages=139–157|issn=0168-7034|doi=10.1007/s10603-012-9216-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) may send cease-and-desist orders or require a fine of $16,000 per day for those that violate its "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-publishes-final-guides-governing-endorsements-testimonials/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf|title=Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC's guides were updated in 2009 to address social media and word-of-mouth marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/08/pr-firm-settles-with-ftc-over-alleged-app-store-astroturfing/|publisher=Ars Technica|title=PR firm settles with FTC over alleged App Store astroturfing|first=Chris|last=Foresman|date=August 27, 2010 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Giga Om|url=http://gigaom.com/2012/04/26/the-ethics-of-astro-turfing-sleazy-or-smart-business/|first=Jeff|last=Roberts|date=April 26, 2012|accessdate=June 20, 2014|title=The ethics of astro-turfing: sleazy or smart business?}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article in the ''Journal of Consumer Policy'', the FTC's guides holds advertisers responsible for ensuring [[blogger (person)|bloggers]] or product endorsers comply with the guides, and any product endorsers with a material connection are required to provide honest reviews.&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"/&gt;

In the [[European Union]], the [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]] requires that paid-for editorial content in the media provide a clear disclosure that the content is a sponsored advertisement.&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"/&gt; Additionally, it prohibits those with a material connection from misleading readers into thinking they are a regular consumer.&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"/&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] has the [[Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/12/08/eu_consumer_protection_laws/|title=EU rolls out out astroturf guide for consumer laws|author=OUTLAW.COM|publisher=The Register|date=2009-12-08|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibits "Falsely representing oneself as a consumer." They allow for up to two years in prison and unlimited fines for breaches.&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"/&gt; Additionally, the advertising industry in the UK has adopted many voluntary policies, such as the Code of Non-Broadcast Advertising, Sale, Promotion and Direct Marketing. A trade association, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]], investigates complaints of breaches. The policy requires that marketing professionals not mislead their audience, including by omitting a disclosure of their material connection.&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"/&gt;

In [[Australia]] astroturfing is regulated by Section 18 of the [[Australian Consumer Law]], which broadly prohibits "misleading and deceptive conduct." According to the ''Journal of Consumer Policy'', Australia's laws, which were introduced in 1975, are more vague. In most cases, they are enforced through lawsuits from competitors, rather than the regulatory body, the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]].&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"/&gt; There is also an International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN).&lt;ref name="ls"/&gt;

Legal regulations are primarily targeted towards testimonials, endorsements and statements as to the performance or quality of a product. Employees of an organization may be considered acting as customers if their actions are not guided by authority within the company.&lt;ref name="ls"/&gt;

In October 2018, after denying that they had paid for people to show up in support of a controversial power plant development project in New Orleans, [[Entergy]] was fined five million dollars for using astroturf firm The Hawthorn Group to provide actors to prevent real community members' voices from being counted at city council meetings and show false grassroots support.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;https://www.wdsu.com/article/independent-report-on-entergy-paid-actors-scandal-released/24418971&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==

===Effectiveness===

In the book ''Grassroots for Hire: [[Public affairs industry|Public Affairs]] Consultants in American Democracy,'' Edward Walker defines "astroturfing" as public participation that is perceived as heavily incentivized, as fraudulent (claims are attributed to those who did not make such statements), or as an elite campaign masquerading as a mass movement.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Edward |date=2014 |title=Grassroots for Hire: Public Affairs Consultants in American Democracy |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/grassroots-hire-public-affairs-consultants-american-democracy?format=PB |location=Cambridge and New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=33 |isbn=9781107619012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not all campaigns by professional grassroots [[lobbying]] consultants meet this definition, the book finds that the elite-sponsored grassroots campaigns often fail when they are not transparent about their sources of sponsorship and/or fail to develop partnerships with constituencies that have an independent interest in the issue. Walker highlights the case of [[Working Families for Wal-Mart]], in which the campaign's lack of transparency led to its demise.

A study published in the ''Journal of [[Business Ethics]]'' examined the effects of websites operated by front groups on students. It found that astroturfing was effective at creating uncertainty and lowering trust about claims, thereby changing perceptions that tend to favor the business interests behind the astroturfing effort.&lt;ref name="ChoMartens2011"/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that "consumer" reviews are more effective, because "they purport to be testimonials of real people, even though some are bought and sold just like everything else on the commercial Internet."&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt; Some organizations feel that their business is threatened by negative comments, so they may engage in astroturfing to drown them out.&lt;ref name="set"/&gt; Online comments from astroturfing employees can also sway the discussion through the influence of [[groupthink]].&lt;ref name="bbctwo"/&gt;

===Justification===
Some astroturfing operatives defend their practice.&lt;ref name=summer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/26312.html|title=The Summer of Astroturf|date=August 21, 2009|publisher=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|author=Ben Smith|author-link=Ben Smith (journalist)|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding "movements that have organized aggressively to exaggerate their sway," author Ryan Sager said that this "isn't cheating. Doing everything in your power to get your people to show up is basic politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=opinion|title= Keep Off the Astroturf |accessdate=2009-08-26|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/opinion/19sager.html?_r=1|first=Ryan|last=Sanger | date=August 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Porter/Novelli executive, "There will be times when the position you advocate, no matter how well framed and supported, will not be accepted by the public simply because you are who you are."&lt;ref name="Beder"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Beder| first = Sharon | title = Public Relations' Role in Manufacturing Artificial Grass Roots Coalitions | journal = Public Relations Quarterly | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 21–3 | publisher = Public Relations Quarterly | date = Summer 1998 | url = http://www.uow.edu.au/~sharonb/PR.html | accessdate = April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on society===
Data mining expert Bing Liu ([[University of Illinois]]) estimated that one-third of all consumer reviews on the Internet are fake.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', this has made it hard to tell the difference between "popular sentiment" and "manufactured public opinion."&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-grandia/bonner-associates-the-lon_b_269976.html |title=Bonner &amp; Associates: The Long and Undemocratic History of Astroturfing|first=Kevin|last=Grandia|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=August 26, 2009|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article in the ''Journal of Business Ethics'', astroturfing threatens the legitimacy of genuine grassroots movements. The authors argued that astroturfing that is "purposefully designed to fulfill corporate agendas, manipulate public opinion and harm scientific research represents a serious lapse in ethical conduct."&lt;ref name="ChoMartens2011"/&gt; A 2011 report found that often paid posters from competing companies are attacking each other in forums and overwhelming regular participants in the process.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite arXiv

The author said that it undermines the public's ability to inform potential customers of sub-standard products or inappropriate business practices, but also noted that fake reviews were difficult to detect.&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"/&gt;

==Techniques==
Use of one or more [[front groups]] is one astroturfing technique. These groups typically present themselves as serving the public interest, while actually working on behalf of a corporate or political sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | first =George

==History of incidents==

===Origins===
Although the term "astroturfing" was not yet developed, an early example of the practice was in Act 1, Scene 2 of [[Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. In the play, Cassius writes fake letters from "the public" to convince Brutus to assassinate Caesar.&lt;ref name="ls"/&gt; In the early 1900s [[disposable cup]] vendor [[Dixie Cup]]s convinced travelers to avoid public drinking cups found in trains and shops through a pamphlet called ''The Cup Campaigner''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academicmuseum.lafayette.edu/special/dixie/company.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112065042/http://academicmuseum.lafayette.edu/special/dixie/company.html |archivedate=November 12, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet warned that public drinking cups could spread disease and did not disclose that the message was commercially motivated.&lt;ref name="science"/&gt; The term "astroturfing" was first coined in 1985 by [[Texas]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[United States Senate|senator]] [[Lloyd Bentsen]] when he said, "a fellow from Texas can tell the difference between grass roots and AstroTurf... this is generated mail."&lt;ref name="ls"&gt;Kolivos, Eugenia, and Anna Kuperman.

===Tobacco===
In response to the passage of tobacco control legislation in the US, [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]], [[Burson-Marsteller]] and other tobacco interests created the [[National Smokers Alliance]] (NSA) in 1993. The NSA and other tobacco interests initiated an aggressive public relations campaign from 1994 to 1999 in an effort to exaggerate the appearance of grassroots support for smoker's rights. According to an article in the ''Journal of Health Communication'', the NSA had mixed success at defeating bills that were damaging revenues of tobacco interests.&lt;ref name="Givel2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Givel|first1=Michael|title=Consent and Counter-Mobilization: The Case of The National Smokers Alliance|journal=Journal of Health Communication|volume=12|issue=4|year=2007|pages=339–357|issn=1081-0730|doi=10.1080/10810730701326002|pmid=17558787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
Email, automated phone calls, form letters, and the Internet made astroturfing more economical and prolific in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite news| url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/feb/23/need-to-protect-internet-from-astroturfing | title = The need to protect the internet from 'astroturfing' grows ever more urgent | first = George | last = Monbiot | date = February 24, 2011 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | location = London, UK | accessdate = February 24, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110223122306/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/feb/23/need-to-protect-internet-from-astroturfing| archivedate= February 23, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ostler2011"/&gt; In 2001, as [[Microsoft]] was defending itself against an antitrust lawsuit, [[Americans for Technology Leadership]] (ATL), a group heavily funded by Microsoft, initiated a letter-writing campaign. ATL contacted constituents under the guise of conducting a poll and sent pro-Microsoft consumers form and sample letters to send to involved lawmakers. The effort was designed to make it appear as though there was public support for a sympathetic ruling in the antitrust lawsuit.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The LA Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/23/news/mn-37472|title=Lobbyists Tied to Microsoft Wrote Citizens' Letters|date=August 23, 2001|first=Joseph|last=Menn|author2=Edmund Sanders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|title=Report: Microsoft funded 'grass roots' campaign|accessdate=November 19, 2012|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/23/news/mn-37472|date=August 21, 2001|first1=Joseph|last1=Menn|first2=Edmund|last2=Sanders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===

In 2009–2010, an [[Indiana University]] research study developed a software system to detect astroturfing on [[Twitter]] due to the sensitivity of the topic in the run up to the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 U.S. midterm elections]] and account suspensions on the social media platform. The study cited a limited number of examples, all promoting conservative policies and candidates.&lt;ref name="Ratkiewicz 2011 249–252"/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaai/&gt;&lt;ref name=PoliticalAbuse/&gt;

In 2003, GOPTeamLeader.com offered the site's users "points" that could be redeemed for products if they signed a form letter promoting [[George W.

More than 100 newspapers published an identical letter to the editor from the site with different signatures on it.

In September 2013, New York Attorney General [[Eric T. Schneiderman]] announced a settlement with 19 companies to prevent astroturfing. "'Astroturfing' is the 21st century's version of false advertising, and prosecutors have many tools at their disposal to put an end to it," said Scheiderman.

'''''Cha: An Asian Literary Journal''''' is the first [[Hong Kong]]-based online English literary journal. It was founded in 2007, a decade after the handover, by Tammy Ho Lai-Ming and Jeff Zroback. The editorial team also includes Reviews Editor Eddie Tay.

The journal publishes poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction, book reviews, and photography &amp; art from and about [[Asia]]. Although ''Cha'' is primarily interested in Asia-related creative works and works by Asian writers and artists, it also publishes works by writers and artists from all over the world. In its first anniversary issue (November 2008), for example, former Poet Laureate of the United States [[Billy Collins]] contributed four Asian-themed poems. Other former contributors to the journal include, among others, [[Ai Weiwei]], [[Louie Crew]], [[Duo Duo]], [[Eleanor Goodman]], [[Ma. Luisa Aguilar Igloria]], [[Alan Jefferies]], [[Sushma Joshi]], [[Christopher Kelen]], [[Shirley Lim]], [[Lyn Lifshin]], [[Alvin Pang]], [[Todd Swift]], [[Amy Uyematsu]], [[Eliot Weinberger]], [[Alison Wong]], [[Cyril Wong]], [[Bryan Thao Worra]], [[Xu Xi (writer)|Xu Xi]] and [[Ouyang Yu]].

''Cha'' was named Best New Online Magazine of 2008 and Best Online Magazine of 2011 by [[storySouth]]'s [[Million Writers Award]] and was selected as The Gatekeeper's Site of the Week (Wednesday 1 July 2009), on Meet at the Gate, the website of Scottish publisher [[Canongate Books]]. Work published in ''Cha'' has been selected for publication in ''Best of the Web'' and ''Best of the Net'' anthologies (2009). A special feature of the journal is its critique column, "A Cup of Fine Tea", in which previously published works are discussed.

''Cha'' is currently catalogued in the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) Library and other places.

'''Chama''' (Chamá) is a small Late-Classic Maya highland site, situated in the [[Chixoy River]] valley of the [[Alta Verapaz]] department of Guatemala, some fifty kilometers north-west of San Pedro Carchah. Small-scale excavations were carried out in the early twentieth century by [[Robert J. Burkitt]] of the Pennsylvania University Museum. The site belongs to the periphery of the lowland Maya kingdoms. It has been argued &lt;ref&gt;Elin Corey Danien, "The Chama polychrome ceramic cylinders" (January 1, 1998). Dissertations available from [[ProQuest]]. Paper AAI9829880.&lt;/ref&gt; that Chama was colonized from the lowlands somewhere at the beginning of the eighth century and then developed its characteristic, but short-lived Classical ceramic style.

Chamá-style cylindrical vases have black-and-white chevron motif bands painted around the rim and base, with a bright white, and strong red-and-black palette, applied to a distinctive yellow to yellow-orange background. Rather than with scenes of courtiers and warriors, they are often decorated with [[Maya religion#Animal persons|humanized animals]], deities, and mythological scenes.

'''''Chicken Soup''''' is an American [[sitcom]] starring [[Jackie Mason]] and [[Lynn Redgrave]] that aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 12 to November 7, 1989.

==Overview==
The series focuses on the interfaith relationship of a middle-aged Jewish man, Jackie (Mason), and an Irish Catholic woman, Maddie (Redgrave). Episodes centered around humorous situations and obstacles caused by the couple's different religions.

==Controversy and cancellation==
''Chicken Soup'' was scheduled after the number one primetime series ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/arts/television-jackie-mason-stirs-up-a-chancy-chicken-soup.html|title=Jackie Mason Stirs Up a Chancy 'Chicken Soup'|last=Oney|first=Steve|date=1989-09-10|publisher=''New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was canceled because it could not hold a large enough percentage of the audience from its lead-in and because of controversy over inflammatory remarks by Mason during the [[New York City mayoral elections#1989|New York City Mayoral elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959056,00.html|title=Canned Soup|date=1989-11-20|publisher=''Time''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soil-transmitted helminthiasis==
{{Main|Soil-transmitted helminthiasis}}

[[Soil-transmitted helminthiasis]] is a [[neglected tropical disease]] as a result of infection of [[intestinal parasite]]s such as roundworm (''[[Ascaris lumbricoides]]''), whipworm (''[[Trichuris trichiura]]''), hookworms (''[[Ancylostoma duodenale]]'' and ''[[Necator americanus]]''), and pinworm/threadworm (''[[Strongyloides stercoralis]]''). Most prevalent in the impoverished [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions of [[Subsaharan Africa]], [[Latin America]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[China]], where [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] are poor, the disease is an enormous burden on humanity, amounting to 135,000 deaths every year, and persistent infection of more than two billion people.&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite book|author =WHO|year= |title=Eliminating Soil-transmitted Helminthiasis as a Public Health Problem in Children: Progress Report 2001–2010 and Strategic Plan 2011–2020 |url= http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2012/9789241503129_eng.pdf |publisher= WHO Press, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland |pages=1–78 |isbn= 978-92-4-150312-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PLoS Negl Trop Dis |year=2012|volume=6|issue=4|pages=e1582|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001582|title=A research agenda for helminth diseases of humans: the problem of helminthiases|vauthors=Lustigman S, Prichard RK, Gazzinelli A, Grant WN, Boatin BA, McCarthy JS, Basáñez MG |pmid=22545164 |pmc=3335854 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The long-term impact is even worse.

==Objectives==

CWW basically is an aim to control STH in children by:&lt;ref name=ifpma/&gt;&lt;ref name=task&gt;{{cite web|author=The Task Force for Global Health|title=Our Work: Children Without Worm|year=2013|url=http://www.taskforce.org/our-work/programs/children-without-worms|work=taskforce.org|publisher=|accessdate=2013-05-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513012828/http://www.taskforce.org/our-work/programs/children-without-worms|archivedate=2013-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Supporting recipient countries in reducing STH infections as a public health and child development problem in accord with the 2001 resolution of the [[World Health Assembly]] by donating [[mebendazole]] for children in order to reduce associated morbidities, enhance education and promote development.
#Encouraging recipient countries to establish a comprehensive and sustainable STH control policy that combines [[mass deworming]] with the promotion of health education and improvements in sanitation and safe water supplies.
#Increasing the use of effective partnerships at the country level.

==Strategy of Action==

CWW targets children of school age through a slogan called the WASHED Framework, which includes systematic promotion of provision of water, sanitation, [[health education|hygiene education]], and [[mass deworming|deworming]]. Since helminth infections are not easily controlled by a simple treatment regime at a specific target level, CWW made a coordinated plan to improve:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= CWW |title=A Comprehensive Strategy for STH Control|date=31 January 2012| url= http://children-without-worms.ugal.com/how-we-target-STH/#WASHED%20Framework|work= children-without-worms.ugal.com |publisher=Children Without Worms  |accessdate= 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Gallo K |title=Handwashing: Is it really all that simple?|date=15 October 2011| url= http://endtheneglect.org/tag/children-without-worms/|work= End the Neglect |publisher= |accessdate= 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Water - Access to [[potable water|drinking water]] for hand-washing and cleaning of foodstuffs to prevent or minimize reinfection.
#Sanitation – Hygienic [[toilets]] and [[Septage|fecal sludge]] management keep infected human [[faeces|excreta]] from human activities, thereby minimizing the risk of reinfection in treated individuals and preventing new infections.
#Hygiene Education - It promotes personal and environmental hygiene in communities where infection is endemic, thus reducing the recurrent infections.
#Deworming - Treatment with broad-spectrum [[anthelmintic]] drugs like [[albendazole]] and [[Vermox]] ([[mebendazole]]) effectively eliminates the intestinal worms, thus the most effective component of the action.

===Implementation of action===

CWW oversees the donation of anthelmintics to the Ministries of Health and Education in eight recipient countries, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Cameroon, [[Cape Verde]], [[Lao PDR]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Uganda]] and [[Zambia]]. The annual donation consists of 200 million tablets of mebendazole from Johnson &amp; Johnson, and 400 million tablets of albendazole from GlaxoSmithKline, and these are estimated for the treatment of up to 300 million children twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Johnson &amp; Johnson|title=A Comprehensive Strategy for STH Control|date=1997–2013| url= http://www.jnj.com/connect/caring/corporate-giving/preventing-disease/intestinal-worms|work= jnj.com |publisher= Johnson &amp; Johnson Services, Inc.|accessdate= 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= 7 Billion Action |title= Improving the health of the world's children through deworming |year= 2011 |url= http://7billionactions.org/organization/940-improving-the-health-of-the-worlds-children-through-deworming |work= 7billionactions.org |publisher= UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund |accessdate= 2013-05-31 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130806073339/http://7billionactions.org/organization/940-improving-the-health-of-the-worlds-children-through-deworming |archivedate= 2013-08-06 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The London Declaration==
{{Main| London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases}}
CWW joined forces with the [[World Health Organization]], the [[World Bank]], the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], the world's 13 leading [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]], and governments of [[Government of the United States of America|US]], [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK]], [[United Arab Emirate]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Brazil]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Tanzania]], to implement the largest global health programme called the ''[[London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases]]'' on 30 January 2012 in [[London]]. The ambitious project is to control or eradicate the major neglected tropical diseases.&lt;ref name=phar&gt;{{cite web| author= The Pharma Letter |title=Research-based pharma pledges on neglected tropical diseases|date=31 January 2012| url= http://www.thepharmaletter.com/file/110665/research-based-pharma-pledges-on-neglected-tropical-diseases.html|work= thepharmaletter.com|publisher= |accessdate= 2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this programme, CWW will continue to disseminate drugs through for the projected eradication by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Uniting to Combat NTDs|title= Children Without Worms|year= 2012| url= http://www.unitingtocombatntds.org/endorsement/children-without-worms|work= unitingtocombatntds.org |publisher= Uniting to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases |accessdate= 2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Church of the Nativity (7703592746).jpg|thumb|Armenian monastery (right) and facade of the Church of the Nativity (left, small)]]
The '''Church of the Nativity''', also '''Basilica of the Nativity''' ({{lang-ar|كَنِيسَةُ ٱلْمَهْد}}; {{lang-el|Βασιλική της Γεννήσεως}}; {{lang-hy|Սուրբ Ծննդյան տաճար}}; {{lang-la|Basilica Nativitatis}})  is a [[basilica]] located in [[Bethlehem]] in the [[West Bank]]. The grotto it contains holds a prominent religious significance to [[Christianity|Christians]] of various denominations as the birthplace of [[Jesus]]. The grotto is the oldest site continuously worshipped in Christianity, and the basilica is the oldest major church in the [[Holy Land]].

The church was originally commissioned in 327 by [[Constantine the Great]] and his mother [[Helena (empress)|Helena]] on the site that was traditionally considered to be the [[Nativity of Jesus|birthplace]] of [[Jesus]]. That original basilica was completed sometime between 333-339. It was destroyed by fire during the [[Samaritan revolts]] of the 6th century, and a new basilica was built in 565 by [[Byzantine Emperor]] Justinian, who restored the [[architectural]] tone of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Cohen |first= Raymond |title= Conflict and Neglect: Between Ruin and Preservation at the Church of the Nativity}}{{full|date= December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of the Nativity, while remaining basically unchanged since the Justinian reconstruction, has seen numerous repairs and additions, especially from the Crusader period, such as two bell towers (now gone), wall mosaics and paintings (partially preserved).&lt;ref name="Belltowers"&gt;Custodia terrae sanctae, Bethlehem Sanctuary: [http://www.bethlehem.custodia.org/default.asp?id=460  ''Crusader bell towers'']&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, the surrounding compound has been expanded, and today it covers approximately 12,000 square meters, comprising three different monasteries: one [[Greek Orthodox]], one [[Armenian Apostolic]], and one [[Roman Catholic]],&lt;ref name="Shomali"&gt;{{cite web |title= Church of the Nativity: History &amp; Structure |author-link= Qustandi Shomali |last= Shomali |first= Qustandi |url= http://docplayer.net/20828358-Church-of-the-nativity-history-structure.html |quote=
Today, the compound of the Nativity church covers an area of approximately 12,000 square meters and includes, besides the Basilica, the Latin convent in the north, the Greek convent in the south-east and the Armenian convent in the south-west. A bell-tower and sacristy were built adjoining the south-east corner of the Basilica. |accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which the first two contain bell-towers built during the modern era.&lt;ref name="Belltowers"/&gt;

==History==

===Holy site before Constantine (ca. 4 BC–327 CE)===
The holy site known as the Nativity Grotto is thought to be the cave in which [[Jesus of Nazareth]] was born.  In 135, Emperor [[Hadrian]] had the site above the Grotto converted into a worship place for [[Adonis]], the Greek god of beauty and desire.&lt;ref name="Giuseppe Ricciotti 1948 p. 276"&gt;{{cite book |first = Giuseppe |last = Ricciotti |title = Vita di Gesù Cristo |publisher = Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana |year = 1948 |page = 276 n }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Maier |first = Paul L. |title = The First Christmas: The True and Unfamiliar Story |year = 2001 }}{{full|date= December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jerome]] noted in 420 that the grotto had been consecrated to the worship of Adonis, and that a sacred grove was planted there in order to completely wipe out the memory of Jesus from the world.&lt;ref name="Giuseppe Ricciotti 1948 p. 276" /&gt;  Some modern scholars dispute this argument and insist that the cult of Adonis-Tammuz originated the shrine and that it was the Christians who took it over, substituting the worship of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Marcello |last = Craveri |title = The Life of Jesus |publisher = Grove Press |year = 1967 |pages = 35–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The antiquity of the association of the site with the birth of Jesus, however, is attested by [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 100–165) who noted in his ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]'' that the [[Holy Family]] had taken refuge in a cave outside of town:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But when the Child was born in Bethlehem, since Joseph could not find a lodging in that village, he took up his quarters in a certain cave near the village; and while they were there Mary brought forth the Christ and placed Him in a manger, and here the Magi who came from Arabia found Him.&lt;ref&gt;''Dialogue with Trypho'', chapter LXXVIII&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally, [[early Christianity|early Christian theologian]] and Greek philosopher [[Origen]] of Alexandria (185–c. 254) wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In Bethlehem the cave is pointed out where He was born, and the manger in the cave where He was wrapped in swaddling clothes. And the rumor is in those places, and among foreigners of the Faith, that indeed Jesus was born in this cave who is worshipped and reverenced by the Christians.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Contra Celsum]]'', book I, chapter LI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Constantinian basilica (327–529 or 556)===
The first [[basilica]] on this site was begun by [[Helena of Constantinople]], the mother of Emperor [[Constantine I]]. The construction started in 327 under the supervision of Bishop [[Makarios of Jerusalem]] and was completed a few years later&lt;ref name=roth&gt;{{cite book |first= Leland M. |last=Roth |year=1993 |title= Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History and Meaning |edition= First |publisher= Westview Press |location= Boulder, CO |isbn=0-06-430158-3 |pages=30, 222}}&lt;/ref&gt; - it was already visited in 333 by the [[Bordeaux Pilgrim]]&lt;ref&gt;Custodia terrae sanctae, Bethlehem Sanctuary: [http://www.bethlehem.custodia.org/default.asp?id=525  ''Anonymous Pilgrim of Bordeaux''], accessed 2018-04-10&lt;/ref&gt; and was officially dedicated on 31 May 339.&lt;ref name="OConnor"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700 |series=Oxford Archaeological Guides |author=Jerome Murphy-O'Connor |year=2008 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=313 |isbn=978-0-19-923666-4 |url={{Google books |id=m3Yy9FDcT8gC |page=313 |plainurl=yes}} |accessdate=10 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of this early church was carried out as part of a larger project following the [[First Council of Nicaea]] during Constantine's reign, aimed to build churches on the supposed sites of the life of Jesus.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Moffatt |first= Marian, et al. |title=A World History of Architecture |year=2003}}{{full|date= December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the basilica centered around three major architectural sections:

===Justinian's basilica (565)===
The basilica was rebuilt in its present form in 565 by Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]].

The [[Sassanid Empire|Persians]] under [[Khosrau II]] invaded [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem|conquered nearby Jerusalem in 614]], but they did not destroy the structure. According to legend, their commander [[Shahrbaraz]] was moved by the depiction above the church entrance of the [[Three Magi]] wearing the garb of Persian [[Zoroastrian]] priests, so he ordered that the building be spared.&lt;ref name="PEFnativ"&gt;The Palestine Exploration Fund, ''The Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem: [https://www.pef.org.uk/church/  Early Christian Period After 529'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nineteenth century===
[[File:Nativity vorobiev.jpg|thumb|left|The interior of the Church of the Nativity as it was depicted in 1833]]

Earthquakes inflicted significant damage to the Church of the Nativity between 1834 and 1837.&lt;ref name="Cyclop"&gt;{{cite book |last=Black |first=Aden |title=A Cyclopedia of Biblical Literature |volume=vol.

By 1846, the Church of the Nativity and its surrounding site lay in disrepair and vulnerable to looting. Much of the interior marble flooring was looted in the early half of the 19th century, much of which was transferred to use in other buildings around the region, including the Haram ash-Sharif ([[Temple Mount]]) in Jerusalem. The religiously significant silver star marking the exact birthplace of Jesus was stolen in 1846 from the Grotto of the Nativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kraemer |first=Joel L. |title= Jerusalem: problems and prospects |year=1980}}{{full|date= December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church was under the control of the Ottoman Empire, but around Christmas 1852, [[Napoleon III]] forced the Ottomans to recognise France as the "sovereign authority" over Christian holy sites in the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref&gt;Royle. p. 19.{{full|date= December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sultan of Turkey replaced the silver star at the Grotto, complete with a Latin inscription, but the Russian Empire disputed the change in authority. They cited the [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]] and then deployed armies to the [[Danube]] area. As a result, the Ottomans issued [[firman]]s essentially reversing their earlier decision, renouncing the French treaty, and restoring the Greeks to the sovereign authority over the churches of the Holy Land for the time being, thus increasing local tensions—and all this fuelled the conflict between the Russian and the Ottoman empires over the control of holy sites around the region.

===Twentieth century to the present===
{{see also|Siege of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem}}
The passageway which connects St. Jerome's Cave and the Cave of the Nativity was expanded in February 1964, allowing easier access for visitors. American businessman Stanley Slotkin was visiting at the time and purchased a quantity of the limestone rubble, more than a million irregular fragments about {{convert|5|mm|abbr=on}} across. He sold them to the public encased in plastic crosses, and they were advertised in infomercials in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-10-12/local/me-53035_1_nativity-stones/2 |title=Rocks of Faith |last=Dart |first=John |date=12 October 1996 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US |issn= 0458-3035 |access-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 50 armed Palestinians wanted by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) locked themselves in the church in April 2002 during the [[Second Intifada]], holding hostage 200 monks and other Palestinians—some of whom served as human shields for the terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Ariel |url=http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-cohen042402.asp |title=The Nativity Sin |publisher= National Review Online |date=24 April 2002 |accessdate=1 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110817045355/http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-cohen042402.asp |archivedate=17 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF did not break into the building, but they prevented the entry of food and cut telephone lines. The siege lasted 39 days, and some of the terrorists were shot by IDF snipers. 

Curtains caught fire in the grotto beneath the church on 27 May 2014, which resulted in some slight damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://wkbn.com/2014/05/27/fire-breaks-out-at-bethlehems-church-of-nativity/ |title=Fire breaks out at Bethlehem’s Church of Nativity |date=27 May 2014 |location=  |publisher=WKBN |agency= Associated Press }}{{full|date= December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Property and administration==
The property rights, liturgical use and maintenance of the church are regulated by a set of documents and understandings known as the [[Status quo of Holy Land sites|Status Quo]].&lt;ref name="Cust29"/&gt; The church is owned by three church authorities, the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Greek Orthodox]] (most of the building and furnishings), the [[Armenian Apostolic]] and the [[Roman Catholic]] (each of them with lesser properties).&lt;ref name="Cust29"/&gt; The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] are holding minor rights of worship at the Armenian church in the northern transept, and at the Altar of Nativity.&lt;ref name="Cust29"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Status Quo in the Holy Places |date=1929 |first=L.

==Site architecture and layout==
The centrepiece of the Nativity complex is the Grotto of the Nativity, a cave which enshrines the site where Jesus is said to have been born.

The core of the complex connected to the Grotto consists of the Church of the Nativity itself, and the adjoining Roman Catholic Church of St. Catherine north of it.

[[File:Basilica 20.png|thumb|right|Plan of the Church of the Nativity from the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica. (1) Narthex; (2) nave; (3) aisles. The Grotto of the Nativity is situated right underneath the chancel, with the silver star at its eastern end (top side of the plan). North is to the left]]

===Outer courtyard===
Bethlehem's main city square, '''[[Manger Square]]''', is an extension of the large paved courtyard in front of the Church of the Nativity and St Catherine's. Here crowds gather on Christmas Eve to sing [[Christmas carols]] in anticipation of the midnight services.

===Church, or Basilica, of the Nativity===
[[File:BethlehemInsideCN.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Church of the Nativity before the latest renovations]]

The main '''Basilica of the Nativity''' is maintained by the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem]]. It is designed like a typical Roman basilica, with five aisles formed by [[Corinthian columns]], and an [[apse]] in the eastern end containing the [[sanctuary]].

The basilica is entered through a very low door called the "Door of Humility."&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt;

The church's interior walls features medieval golden [[mosaic]]s once covering the side walls, which are now in large parts lost.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt;

The original Roman-style floor of the basilica has been covered over with flagstones, but there is a trap door in the floor which opens up to reveal a portion of the original mosaic pavement from the Constantinian basilica.&lt;ref name="Madden"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madden |first=A. M. |title=A Revised Date for the Mosaic Pavements of the Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem |journal = Ancient West and East |volume=11 |year=2012 |pages=147–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 44 columns separating the aisles from each other and from the nave, some of which are painted with images of saints, such as the Irish monk [[Catald|St. Cathal]] (fl. 7th century), the [[Patron saint|patron]] of the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Sicilian Normans]], [[Canute IV of Denmark|St. Canute]] (c. 1042-1086), king of Denmark, and [[Olaf II of Norway|St. Olaf]] (995-1030), king of Norway.&lt;ref name="MurphyOConnor235"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700 |series=Oxford Archaeological Guides |author=Jerome Murphy-O'Connor |year=2008 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-923666-4 |quote= |url={{Google books |id=m3Yy9FDcT8gC |page=235 |plainurl=yes}} |accessdate=10 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The east end of the church consists of a raised [[chancel]], closed by an apse containing the main altar and separated from the chancel by a large gilded [[iconostasis]].

A complex array of [[sanctuary lamp]]s is placed throughout the entire building.

The open ceiling exposes the wooden rafters, recently restored. The previous 15th-century restoration used beams donated by King [[Edward IV of England]], who also donated lead to cover the roof; however, this lead was taken by the [[Ottoman Turks]], who melted it down for ammunition to use in war against [[Venice]].

Stairways on either side of the chancel lead down to the Grotto.

===Grotto of the Nativity===
The '''Grotto of the Nativity''', the place where Jesus is said to have been born, is an underground space which forms the crypt of the Church of the Nativity. It is situated underneath its main altar, and it is normally accessed by two staircases on either side of the chancel. The Grotto is part of a network of caves, which are accessed from the adjacent Church St Catherine's. The tunnel-like corridor connecting the Grotto to the other caves is normally locked.

The cave has an eastern niche said to be the place where Jesus was born, which contains the '''Altar of Nativity'''. The exact spot where Jesus was born is marked beneath this altar by a 14-pointed silver star with the Latin inscription ''Hic De Virgine Maria Jesus Christus Natus Est-1717'' (Here Jesus Christ was born to the Virgin Mary-1717). It was installed by the Catholics in 1717, removed - allegedly by the Greeks - in 1847, and replaced by the Turkish government in 1853. The star is set into the marble floor and surrounded by 15 silver lamps representing the three Christian communities: six belong to the Greek Orthodox, four to the Catholics, and five to the Armenian Apostolic. The Altar of the Nativity is maintained by the [[Greek Orthodox]] and [[Armenian Apostolic]] churches.

Roman Catholics are in charge of a section of the Grotto known as the "Grotto of the Manger", marking the traditional site where Mary laid the newborn Baby in the manger. The Altar of the Magi is located directly opposite from the manger site.

===Church of St. Catherine===
The adjoining '''Church of St. Catherine''' is a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church dedicated to St. [[Catherine of Alexandria]], built in a more modern [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style. It has been further modernized according to the liturgical trends which followed [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]].

This is the church where the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]] celebrates Midnight Mass on [[Christmas Eve]]. Certain customs in this Midnight Mass predate Vatican II, but must be maintained because the ''[[Status quo (Holy Land sites)|status quo]]'' was legally fixed by a [[firman (decree)]] in 1852 under the [[Ottoman Empire]], which is still in force today.

The '''[[bas-relief]] of the [[Tree of Jesse]]''' is a {{convert|3.75|by|4|m}} sculpture by [[Czesław Dźwigaj]] which was recently incorporated into the Church of St. Catherine as a gift of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] during his [[List of journeys of Pope Benedict XVI#Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinian Territories (May 8–15, 2009)|trip to the Holy Land in 2009]]. It represents an [[olive tree]] as the [[Tree of Jesse]], displaying the [[genealogy of Jesus]] from [[Abraham]] through Joseph, as well as symbolism from the [[Old Testament]]. The upper portion is dominated by a crowned figure of [[Christ the King]] in an open-armed pose blessing the Earth. It is situated along the passage used by pilgrims making their way to the Grotto of the Nativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dziennikpolski24.pl/Artykul.100+M5d4c87a1956.0.html |title= Płaskorzeźba w dare |work= Dziennik Polski |date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=15 May 2009 |language=Polish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150426201217/http://www.dziennikpolski24.pl/Artykul.100%2BM5d4c87a1956.0.html |archivedate=26 April 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caves accessed from St. Catherine's===
Several chapels are found in the caves accessed from St. Catherine's, including the Chapel of [[Saint Joseph]] commemorating the angel's appearance to Joseph, commanding him to flee to Egypt ({{Bibleref2|Matthew 2:13}}); the Chapel of the Innocents, commemorating the [[Massacre of the Innocents|children killed]] by [[Herod the Great|Herod]] ({{Bibleref2|Matthew 2:16–18}}); and the Chapel of [[Saint Jerome]], in the underground cell where tradition holds he lived while translating the [[Bible]] into [[Latin]] (the [[Vulgate]]).

==Tombs==
According to a tradition not sustained by history, the tombs of four Catholic saints are said to be located beneath the Church of the Nativity, in the caves accessible from the Church of St. Catherine:&lt;ref name="MurphyOConnor12"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700 |series=Oxford Archaeological Guides |author=Jerome Murphy-O'Connor |year=2008 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=12 |isbn=978-0-19-923666-4 |quote= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m3Yy9FDcT8gC&amp;pg=PT48&amp;lpg=PT48&amp;dq=%22began+in+the+north+in+1537+and+continued+down+the+east+and+west+sides%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Hv7zZyYFL7&amp;sig=_pxHUiAqEHj3XHuagqxlnm8OJ1M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Eustochium&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jerome]], whose remains are said to have been transferred to the basilica of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in [[Rome]]
*[[Saint Paula|Paula]], a disciple and benefactor of Jerome
*[[Eustochium]], the daughter of St. Paula
*[[Eusebius of Cremona]], a disciple of Jerome. A different tradition holds that he is buried in Italy

A number of ancient through-shaped tombs can be seen in the Catholic-owned caves adjacent to the Nativity Grotto and St Jerome's Cave, some of them inside the Chapel of the [[Massacre of the Innocents|Innocents]]; more tombs can be seen on the southern, Greek-Orthodox side of the Basilica of the Nativity, also presented as being those of the [[Massacre of the Innocents|infants murdered by Herod]].

==World Heritage site==
In 2012, the church complex became the first Palestinian site to be listed as a [[World Heritage site]] by the [[World Heritage Committee]] at its 36th session on 29 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://globalheritagefund.org/onthewire/blog/church_of_the_nativity |title = Bethlehem’s Church of the Nativity Could Be Israel’s First World Heritage Site |publisher = Global Heritage Fund |date = 15 June 2012 |accessdate = 29 June 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120706000541/http://globalheritagefund.org/onthewire/blog/church_of_the_nativity |archive-date = 6 July 2012 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was approved by a secret vote&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ibnlive.in.com/generalnewsfeed/news/unesco-urgently-lists-church-of-nativity-as-world-heritage/1018266.html |title = UNESCO urgently lists Church of Nativity as world heritage |publisher = IBN Live News |date = 29 June 2012 |accessdate=29 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of 13–6 in the 21-member committee, according to UNESCO spokeswoman Sue Williams,&lt;ref name="ynet"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4249093,00.html |title = UNESCO makes Church of Nativity as endangered site |publisher = Ynetnews.com |date = 29 June 2012 |accessdate=29 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and following an emergency candidacy procedure that by-passed the 18-month process for most sites, despite the opposition of the United States and Israel. The site was approved under criteria four and six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1433 |title = Birthplace of Jesus: Church of the Nativity and the Pilgrimage Route, Bethlehem |publisher = UNESCO World Heritage Centre |date =  |accessdate=26 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was a controversial one on both technical and political terms.&lt;ref name="ynet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="al"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/06/2012629182452482880.html |title = UN grants Nativity Church 'endangered' status |department = Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date = |accessdate=26 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been placed on the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] as it is suffering from damages due to water leaks.&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt;

==Restoration (2013-2018)==
The basilica was placed on the 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites by the [[World Monuments Fund]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The present state of the church is worrying. Many roof timbers are rotting, and have not been replaced since the 19th century. The rainwater that seeps into the building not only accelerates the rotting of the wood and damages the structural integrity of the building, but also damages the 12th-century wall mosaics and paintings. The influx of water also means that there is an ever-present chance of an electrical fire. If another earthquake were to occur on the scale of the one of 1834, the result would most likely be catastrophic. ... It is hoped that the listing will encourage its preservation, including getting the three custodians of the church—the Greek Orthodox Church, the Armenian Orthodox Church, and the Franciscan order—to work together, which has not happened for hundreds of years. The Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority would also have to work together to protect it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wmf.org/project/church-holy-nativity |title = Church of the Holy Nativity |publisher = World Monuments Fund |date= |accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Kumar |first = Anugrah |url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/bethlehems-nativity-church-to-get-overdue-repairs-63163/ |title= Bethlehem's Nativity Church to Get Overdue Repairs |work= The Christian Post |date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2010, the [[Palestinian Authority]] announced that a multimillion-dollar restoration programme was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-ml-palestinians-ancient-church,0,2313867.story |title= Topic Galleries |work= Chicago Tribune |date= |accessdate=22 December 2011}}{{full|date= December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial phase of the restoration work was completed in early 2016. The project is partially funded by Palestinians and conducted by a team of Palestinian and international experts. New windows have been installed, structural repairs on the roof have been completed and art works and mosaics have been cleaned and restored. Although overwhelmingly Muslim, Palestinians consider the church a national treasure and one of their most visited tourist sites. President Mahmoud Abbas has been actively involved in the project, which is led by Ziad al-Bandak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mail.com/int/scitech/news/4143698-palestinians-renovate-church-jesus-birthplace.html#.1258-stage-set7-4 |title= Sci/Tech – Science &amp; Technology: Breaking news and opinions |publisher= }}{{full|date= December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chutixtiox''' (alternatively spelled '''Xutixtiox''', or  '''Chu'Taxtyoox''' in the [[Sakapultek language]])&lt;ref&gt;Chocano Alfaro 2012, p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt; is an archaeological site of the ancient [[Maya civilization]] near [[Sacapulas]], in the [[Quiché Department|Quiché department]] of modern [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1996, p. 318. Fox 1991, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The site was excavated during the 20th century by [[A. Ledyard Smith]].&lt;ref name="Smith65pp76-94"/&gt; Ceramic evidence excavated at the site suggests a close relationship with the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] capital of [[Q'umarkaj]].&lt;ref&gt;Lovell 2005, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Chutixtiox may have been a settlement in a polity that included the nearby sites of [[Chutinamit]] and [[Xolpacol]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1980, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has been dated to the Late Postclassic period and shows two distinct architectural phases, with the late phase demonstrating close similarity to the central K'iche' region around Q'umarkaj. This matches ethnohistoric documents that describe an early 15th-century conquest of the region by the central K'iche'. The site has been identified as the settlement of the Kumatz group, described as migrating to the area in the ''[[Popul Vuh]]''.

==Location==
The site is located on a high ridge in an area later dominated by the K'iche' Maya.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1996, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; The ridge overlooks an agricultural valley of the [[Río Negro (Guatemala)|Río Negro]].&lt;ref name="Babcock2012p303"&gt;Babcock 2012, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; The site was heavily fortified and may have been a settlement of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]] K'iche',&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1996, pp. 314, 318.&lt;/ref&gt; used to control the valley.&lt;ref name="Babcock2012p303"/&gt; Chutixtiox is {{convert|3|km|mi|}} west of the contemporary site of Tuja.&lt;ref name="Fox91p219"&gt;Fox 1991, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The site is surrounded on three sides by sheer cliffs dropping over {{convert|100|m|ft}} down to the river. On the fourth side it connects to a {{convert|1.5|km|mi|adj=on}} long ridge via a narrow neck of land just {{convert|5|m|ft}} wide. Although the site dominates the fertile floodplains below, the site itself is arid; the vegetation consists of thorny [[acacia]]s and [[cacti]].&lt;ref name="Fox1978p72"&gt;Fox 1978, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlement context==
Ceramic evidence dates the site to the Late Postclassic (c. 1200–1524 AD). A significant amount of Early Phase ceramics were recovered (c. 1200–1350), but the majority of ceramics dated to the Late Phase (c. 1350–1524) and these demonstrated strong similarities with contemporary ceramics from Q'umarkaj, suggesting close links between the two sites during this phase.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1978, pp. 3, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Site architecture is also closely related to architecture at the K'iche' capital, with west-facing temples, similar layout of flanking structures, a defensive ditch at the entrance, and the plaza floor coated with plaster.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1978 pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also important differences to the typical K'iche' settlement pattern as represented at the capital; the ballcourt is not oriented east-west, the architecture is mounted upon an acropolis with a steep defensive wall, and the main temple was radial. Investigator John Fox suggested that the differences may represent the Early Phase settlement pattern, before the site came under the influence of the central K'iche' region, and the similarities being the result of the later close relation with Q'umarkaj.&lt;ref name="Fox1978p75"&gt;Fox 1978, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

The K'iche' epic ''[[Popul Vuh]]'' describes four groups that settled around Sacapulas; these were the Lamakib, the Kumatz, the Tuhal Haa, and the Uch'aba Haa. Kumatz is now associated with the north side of the river, and Chutixtiox may have been Kumatz. The early colonial indigenous ''[[Annals of the Kaqchikels]]'' and the ''[[Título Xpantzay II]]'' both relate that Kumatz was conquered by the central K'iche' in the early 15th century AD.&lt;ref name="Fox1978p76"&gt;Fox 1978, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; These ethnohistoric documents closely match the strong central K'iche' influence evidenced in the archaeology of the site.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1978, pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==

The earliest archaeological exploration of Chutixtiox was undertaken by A. Ledyard Smith in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Chocano Alfaro 2012, p. 488.&lt;/ref&gt; The site covers approximately {{convert|2|ha|sqft}} and contains about 30 structures, with approximately half of these grouped around the main plaza.&lt;ref name="Babcock2012p304"&gt;Babcock 2012, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defences===
[[File:Río Negro, Los Trapichitos, Guatemala 04.JPG|thumb|right|The ruins of Chutixtiox occupy a steep hilltop in a curve of the Río Negro]] 
Chutixtiox occupies a highly defensible location, with a defensive wall and additional protection provided by surrounding cliffs.&lt;ref&gt;Borgstede and Mathieu 2007, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; In two places where the drop to the river is not sheer, the natural slope has been fortified. A gentler slope westwards to the river, on the north side of the site, was reinforced with a {{convert|4|m|ft|adj=on}} high wall running down from the hilltop to the river bank. On the northeast side the slope down to the river is naturally steep, but the top {{convert|3|to|4|m|ft}} was cut away to present a vertical drop. Chutixtiox had a single entrance on the northwest side, close to the upper end of the defensive wall.&lt;ref name="Fox1978p72"/&gt; A defensive ditch was cut across the neck of land connecting the site to the adjacent ridge to defend the approach.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1978, pp.72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
The site core consists of an acropolis supporting a plaza, around which all the civic architecture is arranged, with the exception of two structures. The acropolis terrace rises {{convert|4|m|ft}} above the adjoining level, and has inset masonry retaining walls. Five stairways were used to access the acropolis level. The masonry is well-preserved and built from cut [[schistose]] slabs. In some places a later building stage uses dressed [[limestone]] blocks. The masonry was coated with plaster.&lt;ref name="Fox1978p72"/&gt; The majority of structures at the site are aligned with the [[cardinal direction]]s.&lt;ref name="Fox91p219"/&gt; The long structures at the site featured [[corbel arch|corbel vaulting]], an architectural form derived from the Maya lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1987, 2008, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Main plaza====
{{double image|right|Xutixtiox 11.JPG|300px|Xutixtiox 06.JPG|300px|Radial pyramid located in the main plaza|Long council-house structure with some stucco coating intact}}
The main plaza of the site features a radial pyramid with a single stairway on each side;&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1987, 2008, pp. 118, 122.&lt;/ref&gt; it stands {{convert|6.8|m|ft}} tall.&lt;ref name="Babcock2012p304"/&gt; The pyramid is flanked by roughly symmetrical architectural complexes on the north and south sides of the plaza, consisting of a long council-house structure and a smaller shrine standing between the east end of each long structure and the radial temple.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1987, 2008, pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; The flanking shrines stand approximately {{convert|3|m|ft}} high, and each possessed a single west-facing stairway.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1978, pp. 72, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The long  structures flanking the plaza each possessed a single room upon a basal platform, with benches set against the back and side walls.&lt;ref name="Fox1978p74"&gt;Fox 1978, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the long structures measures {{convert|22|by|5|m|ft}}, standing upon a basal platform measuring {{convert|32|by|12|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Babcock2012p304"/&gt;

Structure 10 possessed a stone-lined tomb, rectangular in form, with its doorway sealed by a stone slab.&lt;ref name="Smith65pp76-94"/&gt; Structure 12 was a small shrine with doorways in all four sides.&lt;ref name="Smith65pp76-94"&gt;Smith 1965, pp. 76–94.&lt;/ref&gt; During excavations, a well-preserved sculpture of a crouching [[Jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures|jaguar]] was uncovered at the base of the stairway of Structure 3, one of the long structures,&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1987, 2008, pp. 41–43. Smith 1965, pp. 76–94.&lt;/ref&gt; and a life-size stucco sculpture of a jaguar was found buried with the deceased in a tomb under another of northern long structure flanking the main plaza.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1987, 2008, pp. 41–43. Fox 1978, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]]''' measures {{convert|35|m|ft}} along its major axis and is aligned 15–17° off north-south.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1991, pp. 216, 219.&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated along the side of the plaza,&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1987, 2008, pp. 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; upon a lower terrace,&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1987, 2008, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; and may have been regarded as a part of the plaza complex.&lt;ref name="Fox1978p74"/&gt; The walls of the playing area are almost vertical, and the top of the eastern range of the ballcourt is on the same level as the adjoining floor of the main plaza.&lt;ref name="Fox1978p74"/&gt;

====Secondary plaza====
[[File:Xutixtiox 52.JPG|thumb|right|Long structure in the secondary plaza]]
On the same level as the ballcourt there is a secondary plaza that contains an unusual long structure with a sunken court.&lt;ref&gt;Babcock 2012, p. 304. Fox 1978, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The superstructure possessed free-standing masonry walls, with a single room that contained benches. Holes near the top of the walls probably held wooden beams that supported a wooden roof.&lt;ref name="Fox1978p74"/&gt; The long structure contained a raised plaster ring standing {{convert|5|cm|in}} high,&lt;ref name="Babcock2012p304"/&gt; and measuring {{convert|1|m|ft}} across.&lt;ref&gt;Babcock 2012, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; An altar accompanies the long structure in the secondary plaza.&lt;ref name="Babcock2012p304"/&gt;

====Other structures====
Numerous low residential platforms are located on the western terraces of the site. An underground passage is said to lead down from the ruins to the river, but archaeologists were unable to verify its existence.&lt;ref name="Fox1978p74"/&gt;

'''Dawn Atkins''' (born February 13, 1962) is an American writer of [[nonfiction]] and [[fiction]], as well as an activist and educator.

She has had an influence in a number of diverse areas including [[journalism]], [[anthropology]], [[body image]], [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]], [[feminism]], [[gender and sexuality studies]], and [[Neopaganism]].

== Professional biography ==
Atkins has written dozens of published non-fiction works in journalism and anthropology and is the editor/author of three non-fiction books in sexuality studies – ''Looking Queer'', ''Lesbian Sex Scandals'', and ''Bisexual Women in the Twentieth Century''.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Atkins' first published poem was at age nine, first award for writing at age eleven, first paid publication at age twelve and first fiction published at age fifteen. As a teenager, Atkins was a student journalist who won awards as a writer and editor of both the school newspaper and literary journal.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Before even finishing high school, Atkins also began ''Shadows Of...'', a science fiction and fantasy magazine which ran from 1979–1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philsp.com/data/data319.html |title=Science fiction magazine date files |publisher=Philsp.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.locusmag.com/index/chklst/mg0906.htm |title=Locus magazine index |publisher=Locusmag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped launch the careers of a number of authors and artists. In addition to demands of both these publications and school, Atkins worked part-time at the local professional newspaper,''The Moore Monitor'' (1980–1981). Work in all these areas earned Atkins a journalism scholarship to the [[University of Oklahoma]]. After starting OU, she also worked for ''[[The Norman Transcript]]'' (1981–1982).

In 1984, Atkins left school to accept a full-time position as Managing Editor at ''[[Locus Magazine]]'' (The Magazine Of The Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Field).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pe.cgi?25585 |title=Locus publication listings |publisher=Isfdb.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, Atkins redesigned the magazine and earned a [[Hugo Award]] (1985). Atkins left ''Locus'' and returned to college in 1986, completing Bachelor of Arts (double major) in Professional Writing and Anthropology from the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (1989), while also working part-time as both a writing instructor at UCSC and a journalist with several local publications, including popular weekly newspaper, ''The Sun''.

Atkins is the daughter of feminist activist, Mary E. Atkins, and with her mother had been a member of several activist organizations in both Oklahoma and California, including the [[National Organization for Women]]. Atkins and her mother were part of a movement to raise awareness of body image issues such as appearance discrimination and eating disorders. In 1988, their work led to NOW officially recognizing the need to address body image issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eskimo.com/~largesse/Archives/herstory.html "Fat Feminist Herstory, 1969-1993" by Karen W. Stimson.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607132124/http://www.eskimo.com/~largesse/Archives/herstory.html |date=June 7, 2011 }} Atkins also joined [[NAAFA]] and became their Research Committee Chair.&lt;/ref&gt;

Atkins activism on anti-discrimination led to several years as founder and chair (1989–1994) of a body image education organization, the Body Image Task Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eskimo.com/~largesse/Archives/herstory.html |title="Fat Feminist Herstory, 1969-1993" by Karen W. Stimson. |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607132124/http://www.eskimo.com/~largesse/Archives/herstory.html |archivedate=June 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atkins was responsible for all the BITF publications and workshops, speaking to the media and other operations. She was featured on such television programs as [[Larry King Live]] and [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]. She gave lectures and workshops on body image at high schools, colleges, community organizations and other venues. Atkins was also one of the co-authors and primary organizers behind the Santa Cruz City Anti-Discrimination Ordinance (1992), which added "sexual orientation, gender, height, weight and physical appearance" to the protected categories and became a model for other anti-discrimination law in other cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/index.aspx?page=223 Santa Cruz Ordinance.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://igs.berkeley.edu/publications/working_papers/WP2000-7.pdf |title=See for analysis of the law. |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225235802/http://igs.berkeley.edu/publications/working_papers/WP2000-7.pdf |archivedate=February 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Atkins was accepted to the doctoral program in Anthropology at the [[University of Iowa]]. Atkins completed a Masters in Anthropology in 1996. While studying at UI, Atkins also presented papers at conferences, taught classes, was assistant to the Director of Women's Studies, the editor of three books and contributing editor to several academic publications. Atkins was guest editor of special editions of the ''Journal of Lesbian Studies'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Atkins |first=Dawn |title=Introduction: Lesbian Sex Scandals |journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=1–9 |year=1999 |doi=10.1300/J155v03n03_01 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J155v03n03_01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Journal of Bisexuality]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Atkins |first=Dawn |title=Introduction: Beauteous and Brave: Bisexual Women in the Twenty-First Century |journal=Journal of Bisexuality |volume=2 |issue=2-3 |pages=1–7 |year=2002 |doi=10.1300/J159v02n02_01 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J159v02n02_01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[International Journal of Sexuality and Gender Studies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Atkins |first=Dawn |first2=Cathy |last2=Marston |title=Creating Accessible Queer Community: Intersections and Fractures with Dis/Ability Praxis |journal=International Journal of Sexuality and Gender Studies |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=3–21 |date=January 1999 |doi=10.1023/A:1023298223105 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1023298223105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawnatkins.org/resume.html |title=Atkins' resume at |publisher=Dawnatkins.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atkins was working on a dissertation for the doctoral program when traumatic injury prevented completing the program. While recovering from the injury, Atkins spent several years as owner of an on-line used and rare book store before returning to writing. Atkins' injury developed into a chronic pain disorder ([[fibromyalgia]]) which prohibited a return to anthropology or journalism. Fiction, a first love, became the new direction for Atkins' energy. Atkins now writes and edits fiction and has published several novels under pen names, including D.M. Atkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmatkins.net |title=Atkins' also publishes erotic fiction under the name D.M. Atkins and other fiction under a third name not associated with her real name |publisher=Dmatkins.net |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Atkins has also been active in [[Wicca]] and [[Neopaganism]]. She was a leader of Pagan organizations in both Santa Cruz and Iowa City, teaching introductory classes, leading public rituals and events. She was one of the founders and leaders of the Iowa Pagan Access Network (1995–1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipan.org/ |title=IPAN website |publisher=Ipan.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2625">'''Fukinuki yatai''' ([[吹抜屋台]]) describes a feature of [[Japanese Art]] particularly associated with ''[[emakimono|e-maki]]''(絵巻) painted scrolls, famously for example, [[yamato-e]].

[[File:Genji emaki 01003 013.jpg|thumb|Scene depicting the death of Lady Murasame on the [[Genji monogatari emaki]].|280x280px]]
[[Image:Ch5 wakamurasaki.jpg|thumb|Scene from ''The Tale of Genji'' by [[Tosa Mitsuoki]], from the 17th century [[Tosa school]] revival of the [[yamato-e]].|319x319px]]

Literally meaning 'blown off roof', ''fukinuki yatai'' relates to the depiction of both interior and exterior environments - including rooms, screens and [[Japanese architecture|architecture]] where the roof and walls are removed and the beams are preserved. The basic visual feature depicts the interior scene from an upper diagonal with the roof, ceiling and sometimes inner partitions removed.&lt;ref&gt;Okudaira, Hideo (1973). ''Narrative picture scrolls''. Arts of Japan 5. Weatherhill.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watanabe |first1=Masako |title=Narrative Framing in the "Tale of Genji Scroll": Interior Space in the Compartmentalized Emaki |journal=Artibus Asiae |date=1998 |volume=58 |issue=1/2 |pages=115–145 |doi=10.2307/3249997 |jstor=3249997}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an artistic perspective, it also importantly describes the composition by which [[Character (arts)|character]] relations, or even feelings, are depicted in the layout.

This technique was used in early Japanese ([[Heian period|Heian Period]] [[平安時代]]) scrolls with very few exceptions until realism in [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]] ([[鎌倉]]) art has flourished.&lt;ref&gt;Beynon, David 2012, Superflat architecture : culture and dimensionality'', in Interspaces : Art + Architectural Exchanges from East to West'', [The University of Melbourne, School of Culture and Communication], [Melbourne, Vic.], pp. 1-9. 
&lt;/ref&gt; The rudimentary function of fukinuki yatai is to portrait multiple narrative stories on the same painting using different spaces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The earliest usage of Fukinuki yatai was found in the biography of [[Prince Shōtoku]] ([[Prince Shōtoku|聖徳太子]]絵伝). Other typical examples are found in [[The Tale of Genji]] (源氏物語絵巻), [[Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki]] (紫式部日記絵巻), and [[Kasuga Gongen Genki E]] (春日権現験記絵巻) .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43928">'''[[Optics]]''' began with the development of [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians and [[Mesopotamia]]ns, followed by theories on light and [[Visual perception|vision]] developed by [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]], and the development of [[geometrical optics]] in the [[Greco-Roman world]]. The word ''[[optics]]'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''τα ὀπτικά'' meaning "appearance, look".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology|year=1996|author=T. F. Hoad|isbn=0-19-283098-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optics was significantly reformed by the developments in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], such as the beginnings of physical and physiological optics, and then significantly advanced in [[early modern Europe]], where [[Diffraction|diffractive optics]] began. These earlier studies on optics are now known as "classical optics". The term "modern optics" refers to areas of optical research that largely developed in the 20th century, such as [[Physical optics|wave optics]] and [[quantum optics]].

==Early history==

The earliest known [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] were made from polished [[crystal]], often [[quartz]], and have been dated as early as 750&amp;nbsp;BC for [[Assyria]]n lenses such as the [[Nimrud lens|Nimrud / Layard lens]].&lt;ref name=BM_Nimrud&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=369215&amp;partid=1 |title=The Nimrud lens / the Layard lens |publisher=The British Museum |work=Collection database |accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many similar lenses from [[ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Babylon]]. The [[ancient Roman]]s and Greeks filled glass [[sphere]]s with water to make lenses. However, glass lenses were not thought of until the [[Middle Ages]].

Some lenses fixed in ancient Egyptian statues are much older than those mentioned above. There is some doubt as to whether or not they qualify as lenses, but they are undoubtedly glass and served at least ornamental purposes. The statues appear to be anatomically correct schematic eyes.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In [[Science and technology in ancient India|ancient India]], the philosophical schools of [[Samkhya]] and [[Vaisheshika]], from around the 6th&amp;ndash;5th century BC, developed theories on light. According to the Samkhya school, light is one of the five fundamental "subtle" elements (''tanmatra'') out of which emerge the gross elements.

In contrast, the Vaisheshika school gives an [[atomic theory]] of the physical world on the non-atomic ground of [[Aether (classical element)|ether]], space and time. (See ''[[Atomism#Indian atomism|Indian atomism]]''.) The basic [[atom]]s are those of earth (''prthivı''), water (''apas''), fire (''tejas''), and air (''vayu''), that should not be confused with the ordinary meaning of these terms. These atoms are taken to form binary molecules that combine further to form larger molecules. Motion is defined in terms of the movement of the physical atoms. Light rays are taken to be a stream of high velocity of ''tejas'' (fire) atoms. The particles of light can exhibit different characteristics depending on the speed and the arrangements of the ''tejas'' atoms. Around the first century BC, the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' refers to sunlight as "the seven rays of the sun".

In the fifth century BC, [[Empedocles]] postulated that everything was composed of [[Classical element|four elements]]; fire, air, earth and water. He believed that [[Aphrodite]] made the human eye out of the four elements and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible. If this were true, then one could see during the night just as well as during the day, so Empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun. He stated that light has a finite speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sarton |first=G |year=1993 |title=Ancient science through the golden age of Greece |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VcoGIKlHuZcC&amp;pg=PA248 |page=248 |publisher=[[Courier Dover]] |isbn=978-0-486-27495-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Euclid]] observed that "things seen under a greater angle appear greater, and those under a lesser angle less, while those under equal angles appear equal". In the 36 propositions that follow, Euclid relates the apparent size of an object to its distance from the eye and investigates the apparent shapes of cylinders and cones when viewed from different angles. [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] believed these results to be important in astronomy and included Euclid's ''Optics'', along with his ''Phaenomena'', in the ''Little Astronomy'', a compendium of smaller works to be studied before the ''Syntaxis'' (''Almagest'') of [[Ptolemy]].

In 55 BC, [[Lucretius]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] who carried on the ideas of earlier Greek [[atomism|atomists]], wrote:

{{quote|The light and heat of the sun; these are composed of minute atoms which, when they are shoved off, lose no time in shooting right across the interspace of air in the direction imparted by the shove.|Lucretius|''On the nature of the Universe''{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}}}

Despite being similar to later particle theories of light, Lucretius's views were not generally accepted and light was still theorized as emanating from the eye.

In his ''Catoptrica'', [[Hero of Alexandria]] showed by a geometrical method that the actual path taken by a ray of light reflected from a plane mirror is shorter than any other reflected path that might be drawn between the source and point of observation.

In the second century [[Claudius Ptolemy]],  in his ''[[Optics (Ptolemy)|Optics]]'' undertook studies of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]].  He measured the angles of refraction between air, water, and glass, and his published results indicate that he adjusted his measurements to fit his (incorrect) assumption that the [[angle of refraction]] is proportional to the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lloyd | first = G.E.R. | authorlink = G.

The Indian [[Buddhist]]s, such as [[Dignāga]] in the 5th century and [[Dharmakirti]] in the 7th century, developed a type of [[atomism]] that is a philosophy about reality being composed of atomic entities that are momentary flashes of light or energy. They viewed light as being an atomic entity equivalent to energy, similar to the modern concept of [[photon]]s, though they also viewed all matter as being composed of these light/energy particles.

===Geometrical optics===
{{See also|Geometrical optics|Ray (optics)}}

The early writers discussed here treated vision more as a geometrical than as a physical, physiological, or psychological problem. The first known author of a treatise on geometrical optics was the geometer [[Euclid]] (c. 325 BC–265 BC). Euclid began his study of optics as he began his study of geometry, with a set of self-evident axioms.

# Lines (or visual rays) can be drawn in a straight line to the object.
# Those lines falling upon an object form a cone.
# Those things upon which the lines fall are seen.
# Those things seen under a larger angle appear larger.
# Those things seen by a higher ray, appear higher.
# Right and left rays appear right and left.
# Things seen within several angles appear clearer.

Euclid did not define the physical nature of these visual rays but, using the principles of geometry, he discussed the effects of perspective and the rounding of things seen at a distance.

Where Euclid had limited his analysis to simple direct vision, [[Hero of Alexandria]] (c. AD 10–70) extended the principles of geometrical optics to consider problems of reflection (catoptrics).  Unlike Euclid, Hero occasionally commented on the physical nature of visual rays, indicating that they proceeded at great speed from the eye to the object seen and were reflected from smooth surfaces but could become trapped in the porosities of unpolished surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. C. Lindberg]], ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; This has come to be known as [[Emission theory (vision)|''emission theory'']].&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2015|title=Two Millennia of Light: The Long Path to Maxwell’s Waves|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=9|issue=2|pages=54–56+60|doi=10.1109/MIE.2015.2421754|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hero demonstrated the equality of the angle of incidence and reflection on the grounds that this is the shortest path from the object to the observer.  On this basis, he was able to define the fixed relation between an object and its image in a plane mirror.  Specifically, the image appears to be as far behind the mirror as the object really is in front of the mirror.

Like Hero, [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Optics (Ptolemy)|Optics]]'' (preserved only in the form of a Latin translation of a gravely defective Arabic version) considered the visual rays as proceeding from the eye to the object seen, but, unlike Hero, considered that the visual rays were not discrete lines, but formed a continuous cone.  Ptolemy extended the study of vision beyond direct and reflected vision; he also studied vision by refracted rays (dioptrics), when we see objects through the interface between two media of different density.  He conducted experiments to measure the path of vision when we look from air to water, from air to glass, and from water to glass and tabulated the relationship between the incident and refracted rays.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), p. 16; A. M. Smith, Ptolemy's search for a law of refraction: a case-study in the classical methodology of 'saving the appearances' and its limitations, ''Arch. Hist. Exact Sci''. 26 (1982), 221-240; Ptolemy's procedure is reported in the fifth chapter of his ''Optics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

His tabulated results have been studied for the air water interface, and in general the values he obtained reflect the theoretical refraction given by modern theory, but the outliers are distorted to represent Ptolemy's ''a priori'' model of the nature of refraction.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==In the Islamic world==
[[File:Ibn Sahl manuscript.jpg|thumbnail|Reproduction of a page of [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]]'s manuscript showing his discovery of the law of refraction, now known as [[Snell's law]].]]

[[Al-Kindi]] (c. 801–873) was one of the earliest important optical writers in the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].  In a work known in the west as ''De radiis stellarum'', al-Kindi developed a theory "that everything in the world ... emits rays in every direction, which fill the whole world."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in D. C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Theorem_of_al-Haitham.JPG|thumb|The [[Circle#Theorems|theorem of Ibn Haytham]]]] This theory of the active power of rays had an influence on later scholars such as [[Ibn al-Haytham]], [[Robert Grosseteste]] and [[Roger Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David C.|last=Lindberg|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|volume=62|issue=4|date=Winter 1971|pages=469–489 [471]|doi=10.1086/350790|title=Alkindi's Critique of Euclid's Theory of Vision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]], a mathematician active in Baghdad during the 980s, is the first Islamic scholar known to have compiled a commentary on [[Optics (Ptolemy)|Ptolemy's ''Optics'']]. His treatise  ''Fī al-'āla al-muḥriqa'' "On the burning instruments" was recontructed from fragmentary manuscripts by Rashed (1993).&lt;ref&gt;Rashed, R., ''Géométrie et dioptrique au Xe siècle: Ibn Sahl, al-Quhi et Ibn al-Haytham.'' Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1993
&lt;/ref&gt; The work is concerned with how [[curved mirror]]s and [[lens (optics)|lens]]es bend and focus light. Ibn Sahl also describes a law of [[refraction]] mathematically equivalent to [[Snell's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rashed | first1 = R. | year = 1990 | title = A Pioneer in Anaclastics: Ibn Sahl on Burning Mirrors and Lenses | url = | journal = [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] | volume = 81 | issue = | pages = 464–91 | doi=10.1086/355456}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used his law of refraction to compute the shapes of lenses and mirrors that focus light at a single point on the axis.

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known in as ''Alhacen'' or ''Alhazen'' in Western Europe), writing in the 1010s, received both Ibn Sahl's treatise and a partial Arabic translation of Ptolemy's ''Optics''. He produced a comprehensive and systematic analysis of Greek optical theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindberg | first1 = D. C. | year = 1967 | title = Alhazen's Theory of Vision and its Reception in the West | url = | journal = Isis | volume = 58 | issue = | page = 322 | doi=10.1086/350266}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ibn al-Haytham's key achievement was twofold: first, to insist, against the opinion of Ptolemy, that vision occurred because of rays entering the eye; the second was to define the physical nature of the rays discussed by earlier geometrical optical writers, considering them as the forms of light and color.&lt;ref name="Alhazen"&gt;"How does light travel through transparent bodies? Light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only.... We have explained this exhaustively in our ''[[Book of Optics]]''. But let us now mention something to prove this convincingly: the fact that light travels in straight lines is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes.... [T]he entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air." – Alhazen, ''Treatise on Light'' (رسالة في الضوء), translated into English from German by M. Schwarz, from [http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/pageview/30949 "Abhandlung über das Licht"], J. Baarmann (editor and translator from Arabic to German, 1882) ''[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft]]'' Vol '''36''', as cited by Samuel Sambursky (1974), ''Physical thought from the Pre-socratics to the quantum physicists'' &lt;/ref&gt;  
He then analyzed these physical rays according to the principles of geometrical optics.  He wrote many books on optics, most significantly the ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (''Kitab al Manazir'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]), translated into [[Latin]] as the ''De aspectibus'' or ''Perspectiva'', which disseminated his ideas to Western Europe and had great influence on the later developments of optics.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 58-86; [[Nader El-Bizri]] 'A Philosophical Perspective on Alhazen's Optics', Arabic Sciences and Philosophy 15 (2005), 189–218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/&gt;

[[Avicenna]] (980-1037) agreed with Alhazen that the [[speed of light]] is finite, as he "observed that if the perception of light is due to the emission of some sort of particles by a luminous source, the speed of light must be finite."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Sarton]], ''Introduction to the History of Science'', Vol. 1, p. 710.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]] (973-1048) also agreed that light has a finite speed, and stated that the speed of light is much faster than the [[speed of sound]].&lt;ref name=Biruni&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Biruni|title=Al-Biruni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Muʿādh al-Jayyānī|Abu 'Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Ma'udh]], who lived in [[Al-Andalus]] during the second half of the 11th century, wrote a work on optics later translated into Latin as ''Liber de crepisculis'', which was mistakenly attributed to [[Alhazen]]. This was a "short work containing an estimation of the angle of depression of the sun at the beginning of the morning [[twilight]] and at the end of the evening twilight, and an attempt to calculate on the basis of this and other data the height of the atmospheric moisture responsible for the refraction of the sun's rays." Through his experiments, he obtained the value of 18°, which comes close to the modern value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Authorship of the Liber de crepusculis, an Eleventh-Century Work on Atmospheric Refraction|first=A.

In the late 13th and early 14th centuries, [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi]] (1236–1311) and his student [[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī]] (1260–1320) continued the work of Ibn al-Haytham, and they were among the first to give the correct explanations for the [[rainbow]] phenomenon. Al-Fārisī published his findings in his ''Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir'' (''The Revision of'' [Ibn al-Haytham's] ''Optics'').&lt;ref name="Gazi"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Hüseyin Gazi |last=Topdemir |title=Kamal Al-Din Al-Farisi's Explanation of the Rainbow |journal=Humanity &amp; Social Sciences Journal |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=75–85 [83] |year=2007 |url=http://www.idosi.org/hssj/hssj2(1)07/10.pdf |accessdate=2008-09-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002144913/http://www.idosi.org/hssj/hssj2(1)07/10.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In medieval Europe==

The English bishop, [[Robert Grosseteste]] (c. 1175–1253), wrote on a wide range of scientific topics at the time of the origin of the medieval [[university]] and the recovery of the works of Aristotle.  Grosseteste reflected a period of transition between the Platonism of early medieval learning and the new [[Aristotelianism]], hence he tended to apply mathematics and the Platonic metaphor of light in many of his writings.  He has been credited with discussing light from four different perspectives: an [[epistemology]] of light, a [[metaphysics]] or [[cosmogony]] of light, an [[etiology]] or [[physics]] of light, and a [[theology]] of light.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 94-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Setting aside the issues of epistemology and theology, Grosseteste's cosmogony of light describes the origin of the universe in what may loosely be described as a medieval "big bang" theory.  Both his biblical commentary, the ''Hexaemeron'' (1230 x 35), and his scientific ''On Light'' (1235 x 40), took their inspiration from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:3, "God said, let there be light", and described the subsequent process of creation as a natural physical process arising from the generative power of an expanding (and contracting) sphere of light.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Southern, ''Robert Grosseteste: The Growth of an English Mind in Medieval Europe'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), pp. 136-9, 205-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Optics from Roger Bacon's De multiplicatone specierum.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Optical diagram showing light being refracted by a spherical glass container full of water. (from Roger Bacon, ''De multiplicatione specierum'')]]

His more general consideration of light as a primary agent of physical causation appears in his ''On Lines, Angles, and Figures'' where he asserts that "a natural agent propagates its power from itself to the recipient" and in ''On the Nature of Places'' where he notes that "every natural action is varied in strength and weakness through variation of lines, angles and figures."&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Crombie, ''Robert Grosseteste and the Origins of Experimental Science'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

The English [[Franciscan]], [[Roger Bacon]] (c. 1214–1294) was strongly influenced by Grosseteste's writings on the importance of light.  In his optical writings (the ''Perspectiva'', the ''De multiplicatione specierum'', and the ''De speculis comburentibus'') he cited a wide range of recently translated optical and philosophical works, including those of [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhacen]], [[Aristotle]], [[Avicenna]], [[Averroes]], [[Euclid]], [[al-Kindi]], [[Ptolemy]], Tideus, and [[Constantine the African]].  Although he was not a slavish imitator, he drew his mathematical analysis of light and vision from the writings of the Arabic writer, Alhacen.  But he added to this the Neoplatonic concept, perhaps drawn from Grosseteste, that every object radiates a power (''species'') by which it acts upon nearby objects suited to receive those ''species''.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lindberg, "Roger Bacon on Light, Vision, and the Universal Emanation of Force", pp. 243-275 in Jeremiah Hackett, ed., ''Roger Bacon and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays'', (Leiden: Brill, 1997), pp. 245-250; ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 107-18; ''The Beginnings of Western Science'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1992, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that Bacon's optical use of the term "''species''" differs significantly from the [[Species#Historical development of the species concept|genus / species]] categories found in Aristotelian philosophy.

Several later works, including the influential ''A Moral Treatise on the Eye'' (Latin: ''Tractatus Moralis de Oculo'') by [[Peter of Limoges]] (1240–1306), helped popularize and spread the ideas found in Bacon's writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seeing and Being Seen in the Later Medieval World: Optics, Theology and Religious Life|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|author=Dallas G. Denery II|page=75-80|isbn=9781139443814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another English Franciscan, [[John Pecham]] (died 1292) built on the work of Bacon, Grosseteste, and a diverse range of earlier writers to produce what became the most widely used textbook on Optics of the Middle Ages, the ''Perspectiva communis''.  His book centered on the question of vision, on how we see, rather than on the nature of light and color.  Pecham followed the model set forth by Alhacen, but interpreted Alhacen's ideas in the manner of Roger Bacon.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lindberg, ''John Pecham and the Science of Optics:'' Perspectiva communis, (Madison, Univ. of Wisconsin Pr., 1970), pp. 12-32; ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 116-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like his predecessors, [[Witelo]] (c. 1230–1280 x 1314) drew on the extensive body of optical works recently translated from Greek and Arabic to produce a massive presentation of the subject entitled the ''Perspectiva''.  His theory of vision follows Alhacen and he does not consider Bacon's concept of ''species'', although passages in his work demonstrate that he was influenced by Bacon's ideas.  Judging from the number of surviving manuscripts, his work was not as influential as those of Pecham and Bacon, yet his importance, and that of Pecham, grew with the invention of printing.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 118-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodoric of Freiberg]] (ca. 1250–ca. 1310) was among the first in Europe to provide the correct scientific explanation for the [[rainbow]] phenomenon,&lt;ref name="Gazi" /&gt; as well as Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (1236–1311) and his student Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī (1260–1320) mentioned above.

==Renaissance and Early Modern==

[[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630) picked up the investigation of the laws of optics from his lunar essay of 1600.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/&gt; Both lunar and [[solar eclipse]]s presented unexplained phenomena, such as unexpected shadow sizes, the red color of a total lunar eclipse, and the reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse. Related issues of [[atmospheric refraction]] applied to all astronomical observations. Through most of 1603, Kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory; the resulting manuscript, presented to the emperor on January 1, 1604, was published as ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' (''The Optical Part of Astronomy''). In it, Kepler described the inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of [[pinhole camera]]s, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as [[parallax]] and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies.  ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics (though the [[law of refraction]] is conspicuously absent).&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp 142–146&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willebrord Snellius]] (1580–1626) found the mathematical law of [[refraction]], now known as [[Snell's law]], in 1621. Subsequently, [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) showed, by using geometric construction and the law of refraction (also known as Descartes' law), that the angular radius of a rainbow is 42° (i.e. the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the rainbow's centre is 42°).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tipler|first=P. A. and G. Mosca|year=2004|title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers|location= |publisher=W. H. Freeman|isbn=0-7167-4389-2|page= 1068|oclc=51095685}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also independently discovered the [[law of reflection]], and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|year=2008 |encyclopedia=Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555262/Rene_Descartes.html#s3 |title=René Descartes |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2007-08-15 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwquAJtW?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555262/Rene_Descartes.html |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629–1695) wrote several works in the area of optics. These included the ''Opera reliqua'' (also known as ''Christiani Hugenii Zuilichemii, dum viveret Zelhemii toparchae, opuscula posthuma'') and the ''[[Traité de la lumière]]''.

[[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727) investigated the [[refraction]] of light, demonstrating that a [[Triangular prism (optics)|prism]] could decompose [[White|white light]] into a [[optical spectrum|spectrum]] of colours, and that a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light. He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that regardless of whether it was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as [[Isaac Newton's early life and achievements#Newton's theory of colour|Newton's theory of colour]]. From this work he concluded that any refracting [[telescope]] would suffer from the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of light into colours, and invented a reflecting telescope (today known as a [[Newtonian telescope]]) to bypass that problem. By grinding his own mirrors, using [[Newton's rings]] to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes, he was able to produce a superior instrument to the refracting telescope, due primarily to the wider diameter of the mirror. In 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes ''On Colour'', which he later expanded into his ''Opticks''. Newton argued that light is composed of particles or ''corpuscles'' and were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with [[wave]]s to explain the [[diffraction]] of light (''Opticks'' Bk. II, Props. XII-L). Later physicists instead favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for diffraction. Today's [[quantum mechanics]], [[photons]] and the idea of [[wave-particle duality]] bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.

In his ''Hypothesis of Light'' of 1675, Newton [[wikt:posit|posited]] the existence of the [[luminiferous aether|ether]] to transmit forces between particles. In 1704, Newton published ''[[Opticks]]'', in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation "Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ...and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Dobbs |first=J.T. |date=December 1982 |title=Newton's Alchemy and His Theory of Matter |journal=Isis |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=523 |doi=10.1086/353114}} quoting ''Opticks''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diffractive optics===
[[File:Young Diffraction.png|right|thumb|Thomas Young's sketch of two-slit diffraction, which he presented to the [[Royal Society]] in 1803]]

The effects of [[diffraction]] of light were carefully observed and characterized by [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]], who also coined the term ''diffraction'', from the Latin ''diffringere'', 'to break into pieces', referring to light breaking up into different directions. The results of Grimaldi's observations were published posthumously in 1665.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Memoires pour l'histoire des sciences et des beaux arts | author = Jean Louis Aubert | publisher = Impr. de S. A. S; Chez E.

[[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] (1638&amp;ndash;1675) observed the diffraction patterns caused by a bird feather, which was effectively the first [[diffraction grating]]. In 1803 [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] did his famous experiment observing interference from two closely spaced slits in his [[Young's Double Slit Interferometer|double slit interferometer]]. Explaining his results by interference of the waves emanating from the two different slits, he deduced that light must propagate as waves. [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] did more definitive studies and calculations of diffraction, published in 1815 and 1818, and thereby gave great support to the wave theory of light that had been advanced by [[Christiaan Huygens]] and reinvigorated by Young, against Newton's particle theory.

==Lenses and lensmaking==
{{See also|Timeline of telescope technology}}

The earliest known [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] were made from polished [[crystal]], often [[quartz]], and have been dated as early as 750&amp;nbsp;BC for [[Assyria]]n lenses such as the Layard / [[Nimrud lens]].&lt;ref name=BM_Nimrud/&gt; There are many similar lenses from [[ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Babylon]]. The [[ancient Roman]]s and Greeks filled glass [[sphere]]s with water to make lenses.

The earliest historical reference to [[magnification]] dates back to [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] in the 5th century BC, which depict "simple glass meniscal [[Lens (optics)|lenses]]". The earliest written record of magnification dates back to the 1st century AD, when [[Seneca the Younger]], a tutor of Emperor [[Nero]], wrote: "Letters, however small and indistinct, are seen enlarged and more clearly through a globe or glass filled with water".&lt;ref name=Kriss&gt;{{citation|last1=Kriss|first1=Timothy C.|last2=Kriss|first2=Vesna Martich|title=History of the Operating Microscope: From Magnifying Glass to Microneurosurgery|journal=Neurosurgery|volume=42|issue=4|pages=899–907|date=April 1998|doi=10.1097/00006123-199804000-00116|pmid=9574655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Nero is also said to have watched the [[gladiator|gladiatorial games]] using an [[emerald]] as a corrective lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pliny the Elder |title=Natural History |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+37.16 |accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen) wrote about the effects of [[Pinhole camera|pinhole]], [[Lens (optics)|concave lenses]], and [[magnifying glass]]es in his ''[[Book of Optics]]''.&lt;ref name="Kriss"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{Harv|Wade|Finger|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elliott&gt;{{Harv|Elliott|1966}}{{rp|Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Bacon]] used parts of glass spheres as [[magnifying glass]]es and recommended them to be used to help people read. Roger Bacon got his inspiration from [[Alhacen]] in the 11th century. He discovered that light reflects from objects rather than emanating from them.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Between the 11th and 13th century "[[reading stone]]s" were invented. Often used by [[monk]]s to assist in [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminating]] manuscripts, these were primitive [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|plano-convex lenses]] initially made by cutting a glass sphere in half. As the stones were experimented with, it was slowly understood that shallower lenses [[magnification|magnified]] more effectively. Around 1286, possibly in Pisa, Italy, the first pair of eyeglasses were made, although it is unclear who the inventor was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=peIL7hVQUmwC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|title=Renaissance Vision from Spectacles to Telescopes|last=Ilardi|first=Vincent|date=2007-01-01|publisher=American Philosophical Society|year=|isbn=9780871692597|location=|pages=4–6|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known working telescopes were the [[refracting telescope]]s that appeared in the [[Netherlands]] in 1608. Their inventor is unknown: [[Hans Lippershey]] applied for the first patent that year followed by a patent application by [[Jacob Metius]] of [[Alkmaar]] two weeks later (neither was granted since examples of the device seemed to be numerous at the time). [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] greatly improved upon these designs the following year. [[Isaac Newton]] is credited with constructing the first functional [[reflecting telescope]] in 1668,  his [[Newtonian telescope|Newtonian reflector]].

The earliest known examples of compound microscopes, which combine an [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] near the specimen with an [[eyepiece]] to view a [[real image]], appeared in Europe around 1620.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murphy|first1=Douglas B.|last2=Davidson|first2=Michael W.|title=Fundamentals of light microscopy and electronic imaging|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0471692140|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design is very similar to the telescope and, like that device, its inventor is unknown.

== Quantum optics ==
{{Main|Quantum optics}}

Light is made up of particles called [[photons]] and hence inherently is quantized.  Quantum optics is the study of the nature and effects of light as quantized photons. The first indication that light might be quantized came from [[Max Planck]] in 1899 when he correctly modelled [[blackbody radiation]] by assuming that the exchange of energy between light and matter only occurred in discrete amounts he called quanta. It was unknown whether the source of this discreteness was the matter or the light.&lt;ref name="Cropper2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=William H. Cropper|title=Great Physicists: The Life and Times of Leading Physicists from Galileo to Hawking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UqbxZpELwHYC|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517324-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|231–236}} In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published the theory of the [[photoelectric effect]]. It appeared that the only possible explanation for the effect was the quantization of light itself. Later, [[Niels Bohr]] showed that atoms could only emit discrete amounts of energy. The understanding of the interaction between light and [[matter]] following from these developments not only formed the basis of quantum optics but also were crucial for the development of quantum mechanics as a whole. However, the subfields of quantum mechanics dealing with matter-light interaction were principally regarded as research into matter rather than into light and hence, one rather spoke of [[atom physics]] and [[quantum electronics]].

This changed with the invention of the [[maser]] in 1953 and the [[laser]] in 1960. [[Laser science]]—research into principles, design and application of these devices—became an important field, and the quantum mechanics underlying the laser's principles was studied now with more emphasis on the properties of light, and the name ''quantum optics'' became customary.

As laser science needed good theoretical foundations, and also because research into these soon proved very fruitful, interest in quantum optics rose. Following the work of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] in [[quantum field theory]], [[George Sudarshan]], [[Roy J. Glauber]], and [[Leonard Mandel]] applied quantum theory to the electromagnetic field in the 1950s and 1960s to gain a more detailed understanding of photodetection and the [[statistical mechanics|statistics]] of light (see [[degree of coherence]]). This led to the introduction of the [[coherent state]] as a quantum description of laser light and the realization that some states of light could not be described with classical waves. In 1977, [[H. Jeff Kimble|Kimble]] et al. demonstrated the first source of light which required a quantum description: a single atom that emitted one photon at a time.  Another quantum state of light with certain advantages over any classical state, [[Squeezed coherent state|squeezed light]], was soon proposed. At the same time, development of short and [[ultrashort pulse|ultrashort]] laser pulses—created by [[Q-switching]] and [[mode-locking]] techniques—opened the way to the study of unimaginably fast ("[[ultrafast]]") processes. Applications for solid state research (e.g. [[Raman spectroscopy]]) were found, and mechanical forces of light on matter were studied. The latter led to levitating and positioning clouds of atoms or even small biological samples in an [[optical trap]] or [[optical tweezers]] by laser beam. This, along with [[Doppler cooling]] was the crucial technology needed to achieve the celebrated [[Bose–Einstein condensation]].

Other remarkable results are the [[Bell test experiments|demonstration of quantum entanglement]], [[quantum teleportation]], and (recently, in 1995) [[quantum logic gate]]s. The latter are of much interest in [[quantum information theory]], a subject which partly emerged from quantum optics, partly from theoretical [[computer science]].

Today's fields of interest among quantum optics researchers include [[parametric down-conversion]], [[Optical parametric oscillator|parametric oscillation]], even shorter (attosecond) light pulses, use of quantum optics for [[quantum information]], manipulation of single atoms, [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s, their application, and how to manipulate them (a sub-field often called [[atom optics]]), and much more.

'''''In Search of a Character: Two African Journals''''' is a slim volume, part travel book, part novelist’s journal, written by English author [[Graham Greene]] and first published in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?dscnt=0&amp;frbg=&amp;scp.scps=scope%3A%28BLCONTENT%29&amp;tab=local_tab&amp;dstmp=1436458504347&amp;srt=rank&amp;ct=search&amp;mode=Basic&amp;vl%28488279563UI0%29=any&amp;dum=true&amp;tb=t&amp;indx=1&amp;vl%28freeText0%29=in%20search%20of%20a%20character&amp;vid=BLVU1&amp;fn=search&lt;/ref&gt;
Greene set two of his novels in Africa; ''[[A Burnt-Out Case]]'', set in the [[Belgian Congo]], and ''[[The Heart of the Matter]]'', set in [[Sierra Leone]]. This book contains the journals, not originally intended for publication, that Greene kept on journeys he made for research purposes before writing those two novels.

The first part, Congo Journal, mainly deals with his journey to the Belgian Congo in 1941 and the people he meets along the way. 
The second part, Convoy to West Africa, covers his journey to Sierra Leone in 1959. He made this trip with the story of his 1960 novel A Burnt-Out Case already partly written and it is apparent he is searching for characters to populate that story.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/graham-greene/in-search-of-a-character/&lt;/ref&gt; Greene fans often find it interesting as a fascinating glimpse into the mind of the writer and of the man.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}

An '''index''' (plural: usually '''indexes''', more rarely '''indices'''; see below) is a list of words or phrases ('headings') and associated pointers ('locators') to where useful material relating to that heading can be found in a document or collection of documents. Examples are an index in the [[back matter]] of a [[book]] and an index that serves as a [[library catalog]]. 

In a traditional back-of-the-book index, the headings will include names of people, places, events, and concepts selected by the '''indexer''' as being relevant and of interest to a possible reader of the book. The indexer may be the author, the editor, or a professional indexer working as a third party. The pointers are typically page numbers, paragraph numbers or section numbers. 

In a [[library catalog]] the words are authors, titles, subject headings, etc., and the pointers are call numbers. Internet [[Web search engine|search engines]] (such as [[Google]]) and full-text searching help provide access to information but are not as selective as an index, as they provide non-relevant links, and may miss relevant information if it is not phrased in exactly the way they expect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexers.org.uk/index.php?id=463 |title=''Human or computer produced indexes?'' |publisher=Indexers.org.uk |date=2013-04-05 |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most advanced investigation of problems related to book indexes is made in the development of [[topic maps]], which started as a way of representing the knowledge structures inherent in traditional back-of-the-book indexes. The [[concept]] embodied by book indexes lent its name to [[database index]]es, which similarly provide an abridged way to look up information in a larger collection, albeit one for computer use rather than human use.

== Earliest examples in English ==
In the English language, indexes have been referred to as early as 1593, as can be seen from lines in [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'' of that year:

''Therefore, even as an index to a book''&lt;br /&gt;
''So to his mind was young Leander's look.''

A similar reference to indexes is in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s lines from ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' (I.3.344), written nine years later:

''And in such indices, althougo small pricks'' &lt;br /&gt;
''To their subsequent volumes, there is seen'' &lt;br /&gt;
''The baby figure of the giant mass'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Of things to come at large.''

But according to G. Norman Knight, "at that period, as often as not, by an 'index to a book' was meant what we should now call a table of contents."&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;Knight, G. Norman (1979) ''Indexing, the Art of: A Guide to the Indexing of Books and Periodicals'' (HarperCollins), pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the first indexes – in the modern sense – to a book in the English language was one in [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', in Sir [[Thomas North]]'s 1595 translation.&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt; A section entitled "An Alphabetical Table of the most material contents of the whole book" may be found in [[Henry Scobell]]'s ''Acts and Ordinances of Parliament'' of 1658. This section comes after "An index of the general titles comprised in the ensuing Table".&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt; Both of these indexes predate the index to [[Alexander Cruden]]'s ''Concordance'' (1737), which is erroneously held to be the earliest index found in an English book.&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt;

== Etymology and plural ==
The word is derived from [[Latin]], in which ''index'' means "one who points out", an "indication", or a "[[Index finger|forefinger]]".

In Latin, the plural form of the word is ''indices''. In English, the plural "indices" is commonly used in [[Indexed family|mathematical]] and [[Database index|computing contexts]], and sometimes in bibliographical contexts – for example, in the 17-volume ''[[Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia]]'' (1999–2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Commire |editor-first=Anne |editor-link=Anne Commire |title=[[Women in World History: a biographical encyclopedia]] |date=1999–2002 |publisher=Yorkin Publications |place=Detroit |ISBN=0-7876-3736-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this form is now seen as an archaism by many writers and commentators, who prefer the anglicised plural "indexes". "Indexes" is widely used in the publishing industry; in the International Standard [[ISO 999]], ''Information and documentation – Guidelines for the content, organization and presentation of indexes''; and is preferred by the ''[[Hart's Rules|Oxford Style Manual]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=R. M. |editor-last=Ritter |title=[[Hart's Rules|The Oxford Style Manual]] |place=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |page=772 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' allows both forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Chicago Manual of Style]] |chapter=7.6: Alternative plural forms |edition=16th |place=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2010 |ISBN=978-0-226-10420-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

G. Norman Knight quotes [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s lines from ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' (I.3.344) – "And in such indexes ..." – and comments:

"But the real importance of this passage is that it establishes for all time the correct literary plural; we can leave the Latin form "indices" to the mathematicians (and similarly "appendices" to the anatomists)."&lt;ref name="Knight" /&gt;

== Indexing process ==

[[File:Atlas maior 1655 - vol 10 - Novus Atlas Sinensis - index - P1080375.JPG|thumb|The first page of the index of ''Novus Atlas Sinensis'' by [[Martino Martini]] (published as a section of Volume 10 of [[Joan Blaeu]]'s [[Atlas Maior]] in 1655)]]

=== Conventional indexing ===

The indexer reads through the text, identifying indexable concepts (those for which the text provides useful information and which will be of relevance for the text's readership). The indexer creates index headings to represent those concepts, which are phrased such that they can be found when in alphabetical order (so, for example, one would write 'indexing process' rather than 'how to create an index'). These headings and their associated locators (indicators to position in the text) are entered into specialist indexing software which handles the formatting of the index and facilitates the editing phase. The index is then edited to impose consistency throughout the index.

Indexers must analyze the text to enable presentation of concepts and ideas in the index that may not be named within the text. The index is intended to help the reader, researcher, or information professional, rather than the author, find information, so the professional indexer must act as a liaison between the text and its ultimate user.

In the United States, according to tradition, the index for a non-fiction book is the responsibility of the author, but most authors don't actually do it. Most indexing is done by freelancers hired by authors, publishers or an independent business which manages the production of a book,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asindexing.org/about-indexing/what-is-indexing/#FAQ1004&lt;/ref&gt; publishers or [[Book-packaging|book packagers]]. Some publishers and database companies employ indexers.

Before indexing software existed, indexes were created using slips of paper or, later, [[index card]]s. After hundreds of such slips or cards were filled out (as the indexer worked through the pages of the book proofs), they could then be shuffled by hand into alphabetical order, at which point they served as [[manuscript]] to be typeset into the printed index.

== Indexing software ==
Commercial software is available to aid the indexer in building a book index.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.asindexing.org/reference-shelf/software/ |title=Software |publisher=The American Society for Indexing |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several dedicated, [[Indexing Software|indexing software programs]] available to assist with the special sorting and copying needs involved in index preparation. The most widely known include [[Cindex]], [[Macrex]], [[PDF Index Generator]] and [[SkyIndex]].  [[TExtract]] is a hybrid semi-automatic program combining conventional manual indexing with automated indexing features and text linking.

=== Embedded indexing ===

Embedded indexing involves including the index headings in the midst of the text itself, but surrounded by codes so that they are not normally displayed. A usable index is then generated automatically from the embedded text using the position of the embedded headings to determine the locators. Thus, when the pagination is changed the index can be regenerated with the new locators.

[[LaTeX]] documents support embedded indexes primarily through the [[MakeIndex]] package. Several widely used [[XML]] [[Document Type Definition|DTDs]], including [[DocBook]] and [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]], have elements that allow index creation directly in the XML files. Most [[Word processor|word processing software]], such as [[StarOffice Writer|StarWriter]]/[[OpenOffice.org Writer]], [[Microsoft Word]], and [[WordPerfect]], as well as some desktop publishing software (for example, [[FrameMaker]] and [[InDesign]]), as well as other tools ([[MadCap Software|MadCap Software's]] [[Flare (software)|Flare]])) have some facility for embedded indexing as well. [[TExtract]] and [[IndeXExploit]] support embedded indexing of Microsoft Word documents.

An embedded index requires more time to create than a conventional static index; however, an embedded index can save time in the long run when the material is updated or repaginated. This is because, with a static index, if even a few pages change, the entire index must be revised or recreated while, with an embedded index, only the pages that changed need updating or indexing.

== Purpose ==

Indexes are designed to help the reader find information quickly and easily. A complete and truly useful index is not simply a list of the words and phrases used in a publication (which is properly called a [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]]), but an organized map of its contents, including [[cross-reference]]s, grouping of like concepts, and other useful intellectual analysis.

Sample back-of-the-book index excerpt:

:sage, 41-42. ''See also'' Herbs ← directing the reader to related terms
:Scarlet Sages. ''See'' ''Salvia coccinea'' ← redirecting the reader to term used in the text
:shade plants ← grouping term (may not appear in the text; may be generated by indexer)
::hosta, 93 ← subentries
::myrtle, 46
::Solomon's seal, 14
:sunflower, 47 ← regular entry

In books, indexes are usually placed near the end (this is commonly known as "BoB" or back-of-book indexing). They complement the [[table of contents]] by enabling access to information by specific subject, whereas contents listings enable access through broad divisions of the text arranged in the order they occur. It has been remarked that, while "[a]t first glance the driest part of the book, on closer inspection the index may provide both interest and amusement from time to time."&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Collison, ''Book Collecting'', London, 1957, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Index quality ==

Some principles of good indexing include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/robohelp/articles/online_help_pt2_06.html|title=Creating Online Help (Part 2): Strategies and Implementation|publisher=Adobe.com|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419113301/http://www.adobe.com/devnet/robohelp/articles/online_help_pt2_06.html|archivedate=2009-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ensuring each topic/section includes a variety of relevant index entries; use two or three entries per topic
* Understanding the audience and understand what kind of index entries they're likely to look for
* Use the same form throughout (singular vs. plural, capitalisation, etc.), using standard indexing conventions

Indexing pitfalls:
* Significant topics with no index entries at all
* Indexing 'mere mentions' --- "But John Major was no Winston Churchill..." indexed under 'Churchill, Winston'
* Circular cross-references: 'Felidae. ''See'' Cats' --- 'Cats. ''See'' Felidae'
* References to discussions of a single topic scattered among several main headings: 'Cats, 50-62' --- 'Felidae, 175-183'
* Inconsistently indexing similar topics
* Confusing similar names: Henry V of England, Henri V of France
* Incorrect alphabetization: 'α-Linolenic acid' under 'A' instead of 'L'
* Inappropriate inversions: 'processors, word' for 'word processors'
* Inappropriate subheadings: 'processors: food, 213-6; word, 33-7'
* Computer indexing from section headings: e.g. 'Getting to know your printer' under 'G'

== Indexer roles ==
Some indexers specialize in specific formats, such as scholarly books, microforms, [[web indexing]] (the application of a back-of-book-style index to a [[website]] or [[intranet]]), [[search engine indexing]], [[Index (database)|database indexing]] (the application of a pre-defined [[controlled vocabulary]] such as [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]] to articles for inclusion in a database), and [[periodical indexing]]&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Carolyn. "[http://www.asindexing.org/site/Weaver.pdf The Gist of Journal Indexing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029145224/http://www.asindexing.org/site/Weaver.pdf |date=2008-10-29 }}", ''Key Words'' 10.1 (Jan./Feb. 2002), 16–22.&lt;/ref&gt; (indexing of newspapers, journals, magazines).

Some indexers with expertise in controlled vocabularies also work as [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomists]] and [[ontology|ontologists]].

Some indexers specialize in particular subject areas, such as anthropology, business, computers, economics, education, government documents, history, law, mathematics, medicine, psychology, and technology. An indexer can be found for any subject.

== References in popular culture ==

In  "[[The Library of Babel]]", a short story by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], there is an index of indexes that catalogues all of the books in the library, which contains all possible books.

[[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'' includes a character who is a professional indexer and believes that "indexing [is] a thing that only the most amateurish author [undertakes] to do for his own book." She claims to be able to read an author's character through the index he created for his own history text, and warns the narrator, an author, "Never index your own book."

[[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s novel ''[[Pale Fire]]'' includes a parody of an index, reflecting the insanity of the narrator.

[[Mark Danielewski]]'s novel ''[[House of Leaves]]'' contains an exhaustive 41 page index of words in the novel, including even large listings for inconsequential words such as ''the'', ''and'', and ''in''.

== Standards ==
* [[ISO 999]]:1996 Guidelines for the Content, Organization, and Presentation of Indexes (this is also the national standard in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand)

== Societies ==
The [[American Society for Indexing]], Inc. (ASI) is a national association founded in 1968 to promote excellence in indexing and increase awareness of the value of well-designed indexes. ASI serves indexers, librarians, abstractors, editors, publishers, database producers, data searchers, product developers, technical writers, academic professionals, researchers and readers, and others concerned with indexing. It is the only professional organization in the United States devoted solely to the advancement of indexing, abstracting and related methods of information retrieval.

[[File:Flint-knapping Demonstration (27349458154).jpg|thumb|Flintknapping a stone tool]]
'''Knapping''' is the shaping of [[flint]], [[chert]], [[obsidian]] or other [[conchoidal fracture|conchoidal fracturing]] stone through the process of [[lithic reduction]] to manufacture [[stone tool]]s, strikers for [[flintlock]] firearms, or to produce flat-faced stones for building or facing walls, and [[flushwork]] decoration. The original Germanic term "knopp" meant strike, shape, or work, so it could theoretically have referred equally well to making a statue or dice. Modern usage is more specific, referring almost exclusively to the hand-tool pressure-flaking process pictured.

== Method ==
{{main article|Lithic reduction}}
[[File:Knapping.JPG|thumb|upright|A leather leg guard protects the knapper from being injured by the edges of the flint]]
Flintknapping or knapping is done in a variety of ways depending on the purpose of the final product. For stone tools and flintlock strikers, chert is worked using a fabricator such as a [[hammerstone]] to remove [[lithic flake]]s from a nucleus or [[lithic core|core]] of [[tool stone]]. Stone tools can then be further refined using wood, bone, and antler tools to perform [[pressure flaking]].

For building work a hammer or pick is used to split chert nodules supported on the lap. Often the chert nodule will be split in half to create two cherts with a flat circular face for use in walls constructed of lime. More sophisticated knapping is employed to produce near-perfect cubes which are used as bricks.

=== Tools ===
There are many different methods of shaping stone into useful tools. Early knappers could have used simple hammers made of wood or antler to shape stone tools. The factors that contribute to the knapping results are varied, but the EPA (exterior platform angle) indeed influences many attributes, such as length, thickness and termination of flakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dibble|first1=Harold|last2=Whittaker|first2=John|title=New Experimental Evidence on the Relation Between Percussion Flaking and Flake Variation|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=1981|volume=8|pages=283–296|doi=10.1016/0305-4403(81)90004-2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305440381900042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hard hammer'' techniques are used to remove large flakes of stone. Early knappers and hobbyists replicating their methods often use cobbles of very hard stone, such as quartzite. This technique can be used by flintknappers to remove broad flakes that can be made into smaller tools. This method of manufacture is believed to have been used to make some of the earliest stone tools ever found, some of which date from over 2 million years ago.
[[File:Soft Hammer.jpg|thumb|left|Soft hammer knapping]]
''Soft hammer'' techniques are more precise than hard hammer methods of shaping stone. Soft hammer techniques allow a knapper to shape a stone into many different kinds of cutting, scraping, and projectile tools. These "soft hammer" techniques also produce longer, thinner flakes, potentially allowing for material conservation or a lighter lithic tool kit to be carried by mobile societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peclin|first1=Andrew|title=The Effect of Indentor Type on Flake Attributes: Evidence from a Controlled Experiment|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=1997|volume=24|pages=613–621|doi=10.1006/jasc.1996.0145|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440396901454#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pressure flaking'' involves removing narrow flakes along the edge of a stone tool. This technique is often used to do detailed thinning and shaping of a stone tool. Pressure flaking involves putting a large amount of force across a region on the edge of the tool and (hopefully) causing a narrow flake to come off of the stone. Modern hobbyists often use pressure flaking tools with a copper or brass tip, but early knappers could have used antler tines or a pointed wooden punch; traditionalist knappers still use antler tines and copper-tipped tools. The major advantage of using soft metals rather than wood or bone is that the metal punches wear down less and are less likely to break under pressure.

In cultures that have not adopted metalworking technologies, the production of stone tools by knappers is common, but in modern cultures the making of such tools is the domain of [[experimental archaeology|experimental archaeologists]] and hobbyists. [[Archaeologist]]s usually undertake the task so that they can better understand how prehistoric [[stone tool]]s were made.

Knapping is often learned by outdoorsmen.

Knapping ''gun flints'', used by [[Flintlock mechanism|flintlock firearms]] was formerly a major industry in flint bearing locations, such as [[Brandon, Suffolk|Brandon]] in [[Suffolk]], England and the small towns of [[Meusnes]] and [[Couffy]] in France.&lt;ref name="ancientcrafts" /&gt; Meusnes has a small museum dedicated to the industry.

In 1804, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Brandon was supplying over 400,000 flints a month for use by the British Army and Navy.&lt;ref name="whittaker"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://web.grinnell.edu/anthropology/Faculty/JohnWhittaker/Articles/2001_The_Oldest_British.pdf | title=The Oldest British Industry: continuity and obsolescence in a flintknapper's sample set | author=Whittaker, John | journal=Antiquity | year=2001 | volume=75 | pages=382–90 | doi=10.1017/s0003598x00061032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandon knappers made gun flints for export to Africa as late as the 1960s.

Knapping for building purposes is still a skill that is practiced in the flint-bearing regions of southern England, such as [[Sussex]], Suffolk and [[Norfolk]], and in northern France, especially [[Brittany]] and [[Normandy]], where there is a resurgence of the craft due to government funding.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flintknapping.co.uk/arch.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health hazards==
Historically, flint knappers commonly suffered from [[silicosis]], due to the inhalation of flint dust. This has been called "the world's first [[Occupational disease|industrial disease]]".&lt;ref name="ancientcrafts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ancientcraft.co.uk/Flintknapping/Flintknapping.html#Health | title=Basic Tool Production Techniques, Health and Safety| publisher=ancientcrafts.co.uk | accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pugetsound"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pugetsoundknappers.com/interesting_stuff/knapping_silicosis_article.html | title=FLlNTKNAPPING AND SILICOSIS | publisher=Pudget Sound Knappers | date=2010 | accessdate=24 August 2015 | author=Kalin, Jeffery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When gun flint knapping was a large-scale industry in Brandon, silicosis was widely known as ''knappers' rot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Knapper's Rot, Silicosis in East Anglian Flint Knappers | author=Batty Shaw, A | journal=Medical History | year=1981 | volume=25 | pages=151–168 | doi=10.1017/s0025727300034359 | pmid=7012479 | pmc=1139012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed silicosis was responsible for the early death of three-quarters of Brandon gun flint makers. In one workshop, seven of the eight workmen died of the condition before the age of fifty.&lt;ref name="ancientcrafts" /&gt;

Modern knappers are advised to work in the open air to reduce the dust hazard, and to wear eye and hand protection.&lt;ref name="ancientcrafts" /&gt; Some modern knappers wear a [[respirator]] to guard against dust.&lt;ref name="pugetsound" /&gt;

== Contemporary study ==
[[File:Enseñando a tallar.jpg|thumb|150px|right|French prehistorian [[Jacques Tixier]] offers modern training in stone knapping.]] 
Modern American interest in knapping can be traced back &lt;ref&gt;Whittaker 1994:56-58&lt;/ref&gt; to the study of a [[California]] Native American called [[Ishi]] who lived in the early twentieth century. Ishi taught scholars and academics traditional methods of making stone tools and how to use them for survival in the wild. Early European explorers to the New world were also exposed to flint knapping techniques. Additionally, several pioneering nineteenth-century European experimental knappers are also known and in the late 1960s and early 1970s experimental archaeologist [[Don Crabtree]] published texts such as "Experiments in Flintworking". [[François Bordes]] was an early writer on [[Old World]] knapping; he experimented with ways to replicate stone tools found across [[Western Europe]]. These authors helped to ignite a small craze in knapping among archaeologists and prehistorians.

English archaeologist [[Phil Harding (archaeologist)|Phil Harding]] is another contemporary expert, whose exposure on the television series [[Time Team]] has led to him being a familiar figure in the UK and beyond. Many groups, with members from all walks of life, can now be found across the United States and Europe. These organizations continue to demonstrate and teach various ways of shaping stone tools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6276">'''Knismesis''' and '''gargalesis''' are the [[science|scientific]] terms, coined in 1897 by [[psychology|psychologist]]s [[G. Stanley Hall]] and [[Arthur Allin]],&lt;ref&gt;Hall, G. S., and A. Allin. (1897) ''The psychology of tickling, laughing and the comic.'' The American Journal of Psychology 9:1&amp;ndash;42.&lt;/ref&gt; used to describe the two types of [[tickling]]. Knismesis refers to the light, feather-like type of tickling. This type of tickling generally does not induce [[laughter]] and is often accompanied by an [[itch]]ing sensation.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris, Christine R. (1999): ''The mystery of ticklish laughter''. American Scientist, July&amp;ndash;August v87 i4 p344(8).&lt;/ref&gt; Gargalesis refers to harder, laughter-inducing tickling, and involves the repeated application of high pressure to sensitive areas.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; While the two terms are used in academic papers, they do not appear in many dictionaries and their origin is rarely declared. The term knismesis comes from the Greek &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;knismos&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; meaning itching&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=knismos&amp;la=greek|title=Definition of knismós in Liddell &amp; Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term gargalesis stems from the Greek &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;gargalizein&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; meaning to tickle&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=gargalizein&amp;la=greek|title=Definition of gargalizein in Liddell &amp; Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The suffix &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;-esis&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; is used to form nouns of action or process. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.star2.com/living/2018/04/09/tickling-cats-tummy/|title=Tickling A Cat’s Tummy: Invite For Cuddles Or Lacerated Hands? {{!}} Star2.com|date=2018-04-09|work=Star2.com|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Knismesis ==
{{wiktionary|knismesis}}
The knismesis phenomenon requires low levels of stimulation to sensitive parts of the body, and can be triggered by a light [[touch]] or by a light [[electric current]]. Knismesis can also be triggered by crawling [[insect]]s or [[parasite]]s, prompting scratching or rubbing at the ticklish spot, thereby removing the pest. It is possible that this function explains why knismesis produces a similar response in many different kinds of animals.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; In a famous example, described in [[Peter Benchley]]'s ''Shark!'', it is possible to tickle the area just under the snout of a [[great white shark]], putting it into a near-[[hypnosis|hypnotic]] [[trance]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17623725.500-the-word-knismesis.html The word knismesis] [[New Scientist]], 7 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gargalesis ==
{{wiktionary|gargalesis}}
The gargalesis type of tickle works on [[primate]]s (which include [[human]]s), and possibly on other species.&lt;ref name = "Provine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Provine | first1 = R. R. | year = 1996 | title = Laughter | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 84 | issue = | pages = 38–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ultrasonic vocalizations described as "chirping", which play into social behavior and even have therapeutic effects, are reported in rats in response to human tickling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20010728/fob9.asp Science News 2001 - requires signup]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wöhr|first1=M.|last2=Schwarting|first2=R.K.|year=2007|title=Ultrasonic communication in rats: Can playback of 50-kHz calls induce approach behavior?|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=2|issue=12|pages=e1365|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001365|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panksepp|first1=J.|last2=Burgdorf|first2=J.|year=2003|title="Laughing" rats and the evolutionary antecedents of human joy?|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=79|issue=3|pages=533–547|url=http://caspar.bgsu.edu/~courses/Reading/Papers/2003PanBur.pdf|doi=10.1016/s0031-9384(03)00159-8|pmid=12954448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rygula|first1=R.|last2=Pluta|first2=H.|last3=Popik|first3=P.|year=2012|title=Laughing rats are optimistic|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=12|pages=e51959|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0051959|pmid=23300582|pmc=3530570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burgdorf|first1=J.|last2=Kroes|first2=R.A.|last3=Moskal|first3=J.R.|last4=Pfaus|first4=J.G.|last5=Brudzynski|first5=S.M.|last6=Panksepp|first6=J.|year=2008|title=Ultrasonic vocalizations of rats (Rattus norvegicus) during mating, play, and aggression: Behavioral concomitants, relationship to reward, and self-administration of playback|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=122|issue=4|pages=357–367|doi=10.1037/a0012889}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, adult female rats may find the tickling sensation adverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paredes-Ramos|first1=P.|last2=Miquel|first2=M.|last3=Manzo|first3=J.|last4=Pfaus|first4=J.G.|last5=López-Meraz|first5=M.L.|last6=Coria-Avila|first6=G.A.|year=2012|title=Tickling in juvenile but not adult female rats conditions sexual partner preference|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=107|issue=1|pages=17–25|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2012.05.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the [[nerve]]s involved in transmitting "light" touch and itch differ from those nerves that transmit "heavy" touch, pressure and vibration, it is possible that the difference in sensations produced by the two types of tickle is due to the relative proportion of itch sensation versus touch sensation.&lt;ref name = "Selden"&gt;Selden, Samuel T. (2004): ''Tickle''. J Am Acad Dermatol Vol. 50, No. 1: pp. 93–97.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is possible to trigger a knismesis response in oneself, it is usually impossible to produce '''gargalesthesia''', the gargalesis tickle response, in oneself.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; '''Hypergargalesthesia''' is the condition of extreme sensitivity to tickling.&lt;ref name="Corsini"&gt;Corsini, Raymond J. (1999): ''The Dictionary of Psychology''. Psychology Press: p. 457&lt;/ref&gt;.  The words knismesis and gargalesis were both used by [[Susie Dent]] in an episode of the BBC game show, [[Would I Lie to You? (game show)|Would I Lie to You?]] (Season 11, episode 4).

==Background==
[[File:Lingerie League (7354243642).jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Referees and players during the All-Fantasy Game, Sydney, 2012]]
The concept of the LFL originated from an alternative [[Super Bowl]] [[halftime]] television special called the [[Legends Cup (LFL)|Lingerie Bowl]], a [[pay-per-view]] event broadcast opposite the Super Bowl halftime show.&lt;ref name="cbs1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Geist |work=[[CBS Sunday Morning]] |title=Lacing Up for the Lingerie Bowl; Bill Geist Learns LFL Players Really Love Football, and Don't Mind Playing in Their Underwear |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/02/07/sunday/main6183312.shtml |date=February 7, 2010 |accessdate=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first three Lingerie Bowls were held annually from 2004 to 2006 and were billed as Lingerie Bowls I, II, and III. From 2007 to 2009, the next three planned Lingerie Bowls (billed as Lingerie Bowls IV, V, and VI) were all cancelled for various reasons. In 2009, LFL chairman Mitch Mortaza expanded the concept from a single annual exhibition game to a ten-team lingerie football league.

Most LFL teams in the United States use the same color scheme as a professional men's football team in the area. Generally, this would be the local [[National Football League|NFL]] teams, although [[United Football League (2009–2012)|UFL]] ([[Las Vegas Locomotives|Las Vegas]], [[Virginia Destroyers|Orlando]]), and former NFL (Los Angeles) teams' color schemes have been used in areas with no current NFL team. In Canada, the teams' colors are based on either [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] teams ([[Toronto Argonauts|Toronto]], [[Saskatchewan Roughriders|Regina]]) or [[ice hockey]] teams ([[Vancouver Canucks|BC]], [[Saskatoon Blades|Saskatoon]]). As of 2014, some teams in Australia use the local [[Australian state colours|state colors]]. In addition, a small number of US based have adopted their own color schemes not reflective of other local teams.{{citation needed|date= May 2014}}

Many of the teams are coached by former [[National Football League|NFL]] players and coaches who are already well known in their respective cities. Many of the players have a background in competitive athletics at the college and semi-pro level, in sports such as [[track and field]], [[tennis]], [[volleyball]], [[softball]], [[soccer]], [[basketball]], and [[physical fitness|fitness]]-style [[bodybuilding]]. A few also have experience in tackle football from playing in other semi-pro leagues.

On January 10, 2013, the Lingerie Football League announced it would change its name to the Legends Football League (while still retaining the LFL moniker). The league announced that the athletes would wear "performance apparel" instead of lingerie, but the uniforms look very much the same as before.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-new-lingerie-football-league-uniforms-2013-1|title=The New Lingerie Football League Uniforms – Business Insider|date=24 January 2013|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the new uniforms, redesigned shoulder pads were introduced to provide more protection for players. Other league changes included eliminating images of sexy women from team logos and changing the league tagline from "True Fantasy Football" to "Women of the Gridiron".&lt;ref name="namechange"/&gt;

==Rules==
[[File:Lingerie League (7354261132).jpg|thumb|right|300px|All-Fantasy Game in Sydney, 2012]]
Playing style is [[full-contact]] and similar to other [[indoor American football|indoor football]] leagues. Uniforms consist of shoulder pads, elbow pads, knee pads, performance wear, and [[ice hockey]]-style [[football helmet|helmets]] with clear plastic visors in lieu of face masks. Prior to the 2013 season, players wore [[garter (stockings)|garters]], bras, and panties.

There are no [[Kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoffs]], except the option for an on-side kick should the game be close near the end, nor [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|field goals]]; halves and after scores begin on team's own 15-yard line.&lt;ref name=Philly&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/video/52018692.html|title= Lingerie football}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kicking off after every scoring drive was added before the 2013 Pacific Cup, but was removed shortly after the first game of the LFL Australia season. A team must attempt to get a first [[Down (gridiron football)|down]] on every fourth down. After a [[touchdown]], a team can attempt a one-point conversion from the one-yard line, or a [[two-point conversion]] from the three-yard line. Since 2015, teams are given the option to [[punt (gridiron football)|punt]] if within their own 10 yard line.&lt;ref name="lflus.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=LFL Game Rules |url=http://www.lflus.com/lfl-101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense can return the ball to their end zone off any conversion attempt for 2 points; the offense can get 1 point if safety is scored off the conversion attempt. 

There are seven women on each side of the 50-yard field, one fewer than the eight players usually found in [[arena football]] or other indoor leagues. Teams consist of 20 players, only 14 of whom are active on game day. This means that there are usually three or four players who play both ways, as "iron women". But coaches are allowed [[free substitution]].

The standard offensive formation features 1 [[quarterback]], 1 [[running back]], 1 [[Center (American football)|center]], 1 guard, 1 tight end, and 2 [[wide receiver]]s. The standard defensive formation features 2 [[Defensive lineman|defensive linewomen]], 1 [[linebacker]], 2 [[cornerback]]s, and 2 [[Safety (American football position)|safeties]] (strong safety and free safety).

The field is 50 yards between [[end zone]]s, 30 [[yard]]s wide, and the end zones are 8 yards deep, roughly the same as other indoor leagues.&lt;ref name=News14&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.news14.com/content/sports/608720/lingerie-football-coming-to-charlotte-in-2010/Default.aspx|title= Lingerie football coming to Charlotte in 2010|accessdate= 2009-05-05|date= 2009-05-04|publisher= News 14 Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A game consists of four ten-minute quarters and a 12-minute halftime (30-minute halftime in championship). In the event of a tie, an extra 8 minute [[sudden death (sports)|sudden death]] period is played; whoever scores first wins it. If still tied, the game ends drawn, and each team receives a one in the tie column in the standings; however, in postseason, multiple 10-minute sudden death periods are played until one team scores, which wins the game. Teams get 2 timeouts per half or overtime period.&lt;ref name="lflus.com"/&gt;

Teams are allowed two coaches' challenges per game by throwing a red flag. If after the play is reviewed, it is upheld, the team loses a timeout; the team keeps the timeout if it is reversed; if they win two straight challenges they are granted a third. All reviews are automatic in the final two minutes of each half and all overtime periods, as are scoring plays and turnovers.{{Year needed|date=January 2018}}

Any player who targets another opponent, such as using the helmet to ram an opponent, risk immediate disqualification, plus a 15-yard penalty.

==Global leagues==
[[File:Legends Football League Australia - (Victoria Maidens vs NSW Surge) (11889482433) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A Victoria Maidens player being interviewed by sideline reporter Sarah Godfrey, LFL Australia, 2014 season]]

The LFL began in the United States, but in 2012, the LFL launched a companion league in Canada. The LFL also kicked off an LFL league in Australia in December 2013.

The LFL plans to launch a fourth global league – LFL Europa – in 2015. LFL Europa would include teams in [[Dublin]] (Ireland), [[Manchester]] (England), [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Hamburg]] (Germany).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfl360.com/articles/lfl-europas-dublin-franchise-set-announce-open-tryouts-lfl360-com-marcus-de-la-fuente/|title=LFL Europa's Dublin Franchise Set To Announce Open Tryouts|author=Marcus Delafuente|accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barcelona]] (Spain) and [[Frankfurt]] (Germany) had previously been mentioned as potential franchise cities.&lt;ref name="lfl world"/&gt;

In 2015, the LFL is planning to have the champions of each of the four proposed global leagues (US, Canada, Australia, and Europe) compete in an inaugural [[LFL World Bowl]] in [[São Paulo]], Brazil.&lt;ref name="lfl world"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lfl360.com/articles/breaking-news-lfl-announces-plans-premiere-leagues-europe-canada-australia-league/|title=LFL Announces plans to premier leagues in Europe, Canada and Australia alongside US league|author= Mitchell S. Mortaza |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LFL also hopes to launch a Latin American league in the near future which would include six franchises throughout Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina, but this league has no expected start date as of yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfl360.com/articles/lfl-global-sport-lfl360-com-marcus-de-la-fuente/|title=LFL: A Global Sport|author=Marcus Delafuente|accessdate=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a successful publicity tour in China and Japan, LFL officials are now looking to debut LFL Asia in the near future, although a set date has not been set until LFL Europa and LFL Latin America have been established.

In addition to adding new leagues, the league is planning on combining LFL's US, Canada and Latin America into one big division known as LFL North America. That is planned for some time after LFL Canada resumes and LFL Latin America debuts.

From January 2015 on, there will three global divisions: LFL Americas, with clubs from Canada, Mexico, and the US; LFL Oceania, with clubs from Australia and New Zealand; and LFL Europa, with clubs from Europe. Every four years, there will be an LFL World Bowl, in which two teams from LFL Americas and one team each team from LFL Oceania and LFL Europa will battle in a single elimination tournament.  The LFL is looking for franchise owners as the league continues to grow.&lt;ref name=Global&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lfl360.com/featured/breaking-news-lfl-global-announces-new-league-structure-and-business-strategy/ |title=Breaking News: LFL Global Announces New League Structure and Business Strategy |date=July 17, 2014 |publisher=LFL360 |accessdate=July 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 2015, LFL announced in its State of the Franchise that there would be no international play through 2017. The sole focus will be on growing the league in the US, the exception being international exhibition games to introduce prospective countries to the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lfl360.com/featured/state-of-the-franchise-lfl-global-strategy/|title=State of the Franchise 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LFL expanded from 10 franchises to 12 for the 2011–2012 season. The LFL accepted five expansion franchises – the [[Cleveland Crush]], [[Green Bay Chill]], [[Las Vegas Sin]], [[Minnesota Valkyrie]], and [[Toronto Triumph]]. Meanwhile, three franchises from the previous season – the [[Dallas Desire]], [[San Diego Seduction]], and [[Miami Caliente]] – suspended operations.

The season kicked off on August 26, 2011, and culminated with Lingerie Bowl IX on February 4, 2012. The LFL Eastern and Western Conference championship games were played back-to-back on January 28, 2012, at [[Citizens Business Bank Arena]] in [[Ontario, California]]. For the second straight year, the [[Los Angeles Temptation]] won the Western Conference championship while the [[Philadelphia Passion]] won the Eastern Conference championship, setting up a rematch in the 2012 [[Legends Cup (LFL)|Lingerie Bowl]] of the previous year's championship game.

====2013 season====
[[File:LA Temptation vs Seattle Mist.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Los Angeles Temptation vs Seattle Mist in Action in Los Angeles – May 4, 2013]]
{{Main article|2013 LFL US season}}

The league delayed the next LFL US season from fall/winter 2012 to April 2013 in order to shift to a spring/summer schedule and to focus on the 2012 LFL Canada season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfl360.com/articles/alert-lfl-united-states-regular-season-schedule-shift-official-statement-commissioner-mortaza/|title=Alert: LFL United States Regular Season Shift and Official Statement from Commissioner Mortaza |author=Jim Wallin|accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2013 season, the LFL accepted two expansion franchises – the [[Omaha Heart]] and the [[Atlanta Steam]]. The [[Toronto Triumph]] switched leagues, joining LFL Canada for its inaugural [[2012 LFL Canada season|2012 season]], while the [[Orlando Fantasy]] officially suspended operations, again leaving the league at 12 teams. The Tampa Breeze relocated to [[Jacksonville, Florida]] and were renamed the [[Jacksonville Breeze]]. The league also aligned their twelve teams into four three-team divisions for the 2013 season.

The 2013 LFL US season kicked off on March 30, 2013. Divisional championship games were held on August 17, 2013, and the conference championship games were held on August 24, 2013, in [[Ontario, California]]. The [[Philadelphia Passion]] advanced to their third straight [[Legends Cup (LFL)|Legends Cup]] (formerly the Lingerie Bowl) by winning the Eastern Conference championship, while the [[Chicago Bliss]] claimed the Western Conference title. The 2013 Legends Cup was held at [[Orleans Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], on September 1, 2013, with the Chicago Bliss triumphing, 38–14.

The Pacific Cup was once again played at ShoWare Center on December 6, 2013. This time the Seattle Mist would face the Los Angeles Temptation due to the cancellation of the 2013 Canada season and not enough preparation from the BC Angels. Several key players from the Angels joined the Mist while a few key players from Las Vegas Sin joined the Temptation. The Mist won by a score of 27–25.

====2014 season====
{{Main article|2014 LFL US season}}
In the 2013 offseason, the LFL announced that the [[Philadelphia Passion]] and [[Minnesota Valkyrie]] had suspended operations for the 2014 LFL US season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfl360.com/usa/lfl-usa-suspends-operation-2014-season-philadelphia-minnesota/|title=LFL USA suspends operation for 2014 season in Philadelphia and Minnesota|author=LFL360.com|date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also announced that the [[Cleveland Crush]] were moving to [[Toledo, Ohio]], and play its home games at the [[Huntington Center (Toledo)|Huntington Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfl360.com/usa/cleveland-crush-moves-toledo-ohio/|title=Cleveland Crush moves to Toledo Ohio|author=LFL360.com|date=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the team suspended operations and never returned to the league.

The season concluded with the [[Chicago Bliss]] defeating the [[Atlanta Steam]] 24-18 in the Legends Cup to win their second consecutive championship title.

====2015 season====
{{Main article|2015 LFL US season}}

The 2015 season took place from April to September, ending with the 2015 [[Legends Cup (LFL)|Legends Cup]]. The [[Seattle Mist]] won the title 27–21, defeating the two-time champion [[Chicago Bliss]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

====2016 season====
{{Main article|2016 LFL US season}}
On September 16, 2015, [[Austin, Texas]], received an expansion team for 2016 to play at the [[Cedar Park Center]] and the name was announced as the [[Austin Acoustic]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} On November 2, it was announced that [[Dallas, Texas]], would rejoin the league in 2016 after being on hiatus since the end of the 2010–2011 season, retaining the [[Dallas Desire]] name, at [[Dr Pepper Arena]]. Austin and Dallas were added to the Western Conferences alongside the [[Seattle Mist]] and [[Los Angeles Temptation]], while the [[Las Vegas Sin]] were suspended for the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfl360.com/lfl-north-america/usa/americas-fastest-emerging-sport-names-dallas-texas-for-2016-expansion/|title=AMERICA’S FASTEST-EMERGING SPORT, NAMES DALLAS, TEXAS FOR 2016 EXPANSION - LFL360|website=www.lfl360.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 12, the league announced a final team for the 2016 season, called the New England Liberty out of the [[Verizon Wireless Arena]] in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], joining the [[Chicago Bliss]], [[Atlanta Steam]] and [[Omaha Heart]] in the Eastern Conference.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

During the season, New England was forced to forfeit its final game as injuries caused the team to have below the minimum number of players needed to field a team. Seattle won a three-way tie with Dallas and Los Angeles for the best record in the Western Conference while Chicago had the best record in the Eastern Conference.  Chicago and Atlanta advanced to the playoffs in the East while Seattle and Dallas advanced in the West.  Chicago and Seattle won their Conference Championships and advanced to the Legends Cup in a rematch of both the previous championship and a meeting earlier in the season though with the opposite result of those two prior matches.  The season ended on August 27, 2016, with the [[Chicago Bliss]] defeating the [[Seattle Mist]] 31–26 to win their third [[Legends Cup (LFL) | Legends Cup]]. The championship game was played at [[WestWorld]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Championship Football Match Played in Revealing Uniforms|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/slideshow/championship-football-match-played-in-revealing-uniforms-8595368|website=Phoenix New Times|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017 season====
{{Main article|2017 LFL US season}}
The 2017 season began with new teams at Pittsburgh and Denver replacing New England and Dallas.  Three teams (Chicago, Los Angeles, and Seattle) completed the regular season with perfect 4–0 records, a first in LFL history.  Chicago and Atlanta advanced to the playoffs from the East while Seattle and Los Angeles advanced in the West.  Atlanta upset Chicago in the Eastern Conference Championship, their first victory against the Bliss following seven consecutive defeats. In a war of unbeatens, Seattle bested Los Angeles in the Western Conference Championship. The season ended on September 3, 2017, as the [[Seattle Mist]] beat the [[Atlanta Steam]] 38–28 in the Legends Cup, played at the [[Citizens Business Bank Arena]] in [[Ontario, California|Ontario, CA]], to cap off their perfect 6–0 season to go with their second LFL title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEW ENGLAND LIBERTY RELEASE HEAD COACH DON WILLIAMS AND STAFF|url=http://www.lfl360.com/lfl-north-america/new-england-liberty-release-head-coach-don-williams-staff/|website=LFL 360|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2018 season====
{{Main article|2018 LFL US season}}
The season began with the new [[Nashville Knights]] replacing Pittsburgh in the East.  Nashville courted controversy by recruiting half of the 2017 champion Seattle squad as free agents prompting the league to create a new rule limiting teams to only five free agents (Nashville had to give up two of the seven who then returned to Seattle).  The Eastern Conference dominated the West in most match-ups and both the [[Chicago Bliss]] and Nashville Knights finished the season with 4–0 records.  In the West, the [[Austin Acoustic]] pulled off an upset against the [[Atlanta Steam]] and quickly rose to become the new conference leader in stark contrast to their winless 2017 season.  Chicago and Nashville advanced to the playoffs in the East relegating Atlanta to its first post-season absence while 2–2 Austin qualified for its first playoff appearance. Austin was accompanied by the 1–3 [[Los Angeles Temptation]], the first team to do so with a losing record (discounting the 2016 Atlanta Steam that finished 1–2 without its forfeit win from the [[New England Liberty]]). Chicago and Austin won their conference championships and advanced to the 2018 Legends Cup. On September 8, 2018, at the [[H-E-B Center]] in [[Cedar Park, Texas]], Chicago beat Austin 28–20 to complete a perfect 6–0 season and win their fourth Legend Cup Championship in six years.

====2012====
{{Main article|2012 LFL Canada season}}

For the [[2011–12 LFL season|2011–12 LFL United States season]], the All-Fantasy Game was played in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. This was due in part to the league's announcement that in 2012 there would be a Canadian Lingerie Football League. LFL Canada was originally scheduled for a twelve-week season with teams in six markets,&lt;ref name="lfl360.com"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lfl360.com/featured/lingerie-football-league-announces-fall-2011-expansion-into-toronto/|title=Lingerie Football League announces 2011 expansion into Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the first regular season game on August 25, 2012, culminating with Lingerie Bowl I Canada on November 17, 2012, one week before the [[100th Grey Cup]].

On September 28, 2011, it was announced that, in addition to the [[Toronto Triumph]] who began play in LFL United States, LFL Canada's other five markets would consist of [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], [[Quebec City]], and [[Montreal]]; ironically, none of those five markets would actually get an LFL franchise.&lt;ref name="lfl canada teams"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lfl360.com/articles/lfl-canadian-markets-announced/|title=LFL Awards 2012 Canadian Market Rights to Five Cities|author= Jim Wallin |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 9, 2012, the LFL announced that [[Abbotsford, British Columbia]], would be the next Canadian city to host a team in the League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfl360.com/articles/lfl-football-ready-laceem-vancouverabbotsford/|title=LFL Football Ready to Lace 'Em Up in Vancouver/Abbotsford |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The franchise played its home games at the [[Abbotsford Entertainment &amp; Sports Centre]] and competed in the Western Division of LFL Canada. On February 20, 2012, the LFL announced that the franchise would be named the [[BC Angels]] following the results of an online fan vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfl360.com/articles/lfl-canada-releases-bc-team-name/|title=LFL Canada Releases BC Team Name and Logo |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision for Abbotsford to host a team sparked some controversy, including expressed concern from at least one city councilor, as "Abbotsford is a deeply religious agricultural community."&lt;ref name="lfl team in Abbotsford "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theprovince.com/sports/Abby+scores+lingerie+football+team/6131740/story.html|title=Abby scores lingerie football team|author= Ian Austin and Mike Raptis |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 22, 2012, the LFL announced that [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] would be the next Canadian city to host a team in the League. Home games would be played at the [[Brandt Centre]].&lt;ref name="regina"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.leaderpost.com/sports/Lingerie+football+coming+Regina/6190964/story.html | title=Lingerie football coming to Regina | publisher=Regina [[Leader-Post]] | work=LeaderPost.com | date=February 22, 2012 | accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 6, the LFL announced that the franchise would be named the [[Regina Rage]] after an online fan vote.&lt;ref name="reginarage"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lfl360.com/articles/lfl-canada-releases-regina-rage-logo/ | title=LFL Canada Releases Regina Rage Team Logo | publisher=Lingerie Football League | work=LFL360.com | date=March 6, 2012 | accessdate=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six days later, on February 28, the LFL announced that [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]] would join Regina as LFL Canada's second team in the Wheat Province. Home games would be played at the [[Credit Union Centre]].&lt;ref name="saskatoon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lfl360.com/articles/breaking-lfl-canada-saskatoon-awarded-franchise-2012-season/ | title=Breaking: LFL Canada – Saskatoon Awarded Franchise for 2012 Season | publisher=Lingerie Football League | work=LFL360.com | date=February 28, 2012 | accessdate=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon releasing the [[Saskatoon Sirens]]' logo and colors, the league announced that LFL Canada was set at four teams for the 2012 season, with the league playing an eight-game schedule, scheduled to end with Lingerie Bowl I Canada the week before the Grey Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfl360.com/articles/toronto-triumph/toronto-triumph-part-ways-coaching-staff/ |title=Lfl Canada &amp;#124; Toronto Triumph Part Ways With Coaching Staff |publisher=LFL360 |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 LFL Canada season began on August 25, 2012 and culminated with Lingerie Bowl Canada I on November 17, 2012, between the [[Saskatoon Sirens]] and the [[BC Angels]] at the [[Abbotsford Entertainment &amp; Sports Centre]] in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia]]. The BC Angels won the inaugural championship game 25–12 with BC Angels' quarterback Mary Anne Hanson and receiver Aleesa Garcia named as the game's MVPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LINGERIE BOWL I: HANSON &amp; GARCIA LIGHT UP THE FIELD FOR BC AS MISSED OPPORTUNITIES AND MISTAKES PLAGUE SASKATOON|url=http://www.lfl360.com/lfl-north-america/usa/lingerie-bowl-i-hanson-garcia-light-field-bc-missed-opportunities-mistakes-plague-saskatoon/|accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2012, the first annual Pacific Cup was played between the Seattle Mist of LFL US and the BC Angels of LFL Canada. Dubbed the 'Border War', the game was hosted by the Seattle Mist at the [[ShoWare Center]] in [[Kent, Washington]], with home venues alternating each season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfl360.com/articles/lfl-announces-first-ever-border-war-wtih-2012-pacific-cup/|title=LFL ANNOUNCES FIRST-EVER BORDER WAR WITH 2012 PACIFIC CUP|work=LFL360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mist won 38-18.

====2013====
{{Main article|2013 LFL Canada season}}

On June 27, 2013, the 2013 LFL Canada schedule was released. LFL Canada accepted one proposed expansion team, the [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary Fillies]]; their home games would be played at the [[Stampede Corral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breaking News:LFL Canada Announces Calgary Franchise For 2013 Season|url=http://www.lfl360.com/articles/breaking-news-lfl-canada-announces-calgary-franchise-2013-season/|accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the [[Toronto Triumph]] suspended operations for the 2013 season, bringing the number of LFL Canada teams back to four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LFL Canada Suspends Operations Of Toronto Triumph For 2013 Season|url=http://www.lfl360.com/articles/lfl-canada-suspends-operation-toronto-triumph-2013-season/|accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 16, 2013, the LFL officially postponed the entire 2013 LFL Canada season until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LFL Canada announces US free-agent pick ups, season to begin October 5th|url=http://www.lfl360.com/canada/bc-angels/canada-announces-free-agent-pick-ups-season-set-kickoff-weekend-october-5/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LFL Canada 2013 season suspended until 2014|url=http://www.lfl360.com/canada/bc-angels/lfl-canada-2013-season-postponed-2014/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130916201304/http://www.lfl360.com/canada/bc-angels/lfl-canada-2013-season-postponed-2014/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the BC Angels were expected to participate in the second-annual "Pacific Cup", an exhibition game between the Angels and LFL US's [[Seattle Mist]]. The 2013 contest was scheduled for December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LFL Commissioners Corner Episode 67|url=http://www.lfl360.com/canada/bc-angels/lfl-canada-2013-season-postponed-2014/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130916201304/http://www.lfl360.com/canada/bc-angels/lfl-canada-2013-season-postponed-2014/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On October 3, it was announced that the Angels would be replaced in the game by the LA Temptation, citing not enough preparation. However, a few key players from the Angels would make the trip to Seattle to join the Mist. A couple of them are staying to play with the Mist for their 2014 Season.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

[[Queensland]] native and wide receiver for the [[Los Angeles Temptation]] [[Chloe Butler]] served as the ambassador of LFL Football coming to Australia and captained the Western Conference squad.

LFL Australia premiered in December 2013. The New South Wales Surge, Queensland Brigade, Victoria Maidens, and Western Australia Angels were the four teams playing in the inaugural 2013–14 LFL Australia season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfl360.com/articles/1st-lfl-australia-major-stadium-deal-announced-perth-lfl360-com/|title=1st LFL Australia major stadium deal announced in Perth|author=LFL360.com|accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 2014, LFL Australia accepted one proposed expansion team, the Adelaide Arsenal their home games would be played at the [[Hindmarsh Stadium|Coopers Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfl360.com/australia/legends-football-league-announces-expansion-adelaide-coopers-stadium/|title=LFL ANNOUNCES EXPANSION INTO ADELAIDE and COOPERS STADIUM|work=LFL360}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on September 29 the 2014–2015 season was cancelled due to the lack of a broadcast partner with competition planned to resume in 2015–2016 including an expansion into New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pirtekstadium.com/news-article/lfl-2014-15-season-cancelled|title=LFL 2014/15 Season Cancelled|work=pirtekstadium.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/parramatta/legends-football-league-cancelled-lingerieclad-players-left-searching-for-new-competition/story-fngr8huy-1227078712532&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, it was revealed that the players and coaches had actually left after disputes and issues with LFL management, namely Commissioner Mortaza. Players and coaches left and joined the [[Ladies Gridiron League]], originally a subsidiary of the LFL now operating as its own league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/legal-action-aplenty-as-wa-lingerie-football-spat-turns-ugly-20150217-13h9ph.html|title=Legal action aplenty as WA lingerie football spat turns ugly|work=WA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadcasts===
From 2009–2010, weekly games were shot in 1080i high-definition and broadcast on some [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate stations, international stations, and online.

In 2010, [[MTV2]] licensed the broadcast rights to 20 regular season and two conference playoff games and aired highlights of those games on a program entitled ''LFL Presents: LFL, Friday Night Football on MTV2''. For the 2011–12 season, MTV2 also broadcast the championship game, in addition to presenting the games in their entirety and broadcasting them live at 9:00 PM ET.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfl360.com/articles/lingerie-football-league-returns-to-the-gridiron-live-this-fall-on-mtv2/|title=Lingerie Football League Returns to the Gridiron Live This Fall on MTV2|author=lfl360.com|accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the league began airing their games exclusively online on a week-delayed basis, releasing their games every Saturday on [[YouTube]]. Games are shot in 1080i.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/mylfl|title=The official LFL YouTube Account}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]] became the exclusive broadcaster of LFL games in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fuse.tv/legends-football-league-press-release|title=Football Season Returns with the Gridiron Goddesses of the LFL on Fuse|publisher=Fuse Media|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lfl360.com/lfl-north-america/usa/lfl-returns-to-national-television-on-fuse-in-hd/|title=LFL Returns to National Television on Fuse in HD|publisher=lfl360.com|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games are broadcast on a week-delay basis on Saturday nights, and are later uploaded to YouTube on Fridays. In the fall, [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen Media]] premiered the reality series, ''Pretty. Strong.'', which focuses on the lives and careers of the [[Chicago Bliss]]. The show was produced by Relativity Television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lfl360.com/lfl-north-america/usa/oxygen-media-set-to-tackle-the-gridiron-with-lfl-series-pretty-strong/|title=Oxygen Media set to tackle the Gridiron with LFL Series, "Pretty.

Fuse did not broadcast the 2016 season. Instead, games were broadcast in select markets on affiliates of [[The CW]] and [[MyNetworkTV]] as well as [[Regional sports networks]] on a week-delayed basis. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lfl360.com/featured/lfl-announces-usa-television-mobile-online-distribution-strategy/|title=LFL ANNOUNCES USA TELEVISION, MOBILE AND ONLINE DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY|publisher=lfl360.com|accessdate=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017, [[Super Channel (Canada)|Super Channel]] became the exclusive Canadian broadcaster of all LFL games through the 2019 season.

===Music===
Since the 2009–2010 season, the Legends Football League has partnered with Five Stone music to compose music for the weekly game highlights, commercials, sound effects, radio shows, and music bed for the games on MTV2 and the international TV stations.

The LFL theme song was originally composed by Five Stone in a collaboration with the vocalist Piper from the band Flipsyde. The LFL theme song changed in 2013 to "The Chosen" by Iowa-based group Drenalin.

Starting with the 2013 Australia season, the LFL has dropped "The Chosen" and opted to go with cold openings with dialogue instead of music.

===Fantasy football===
In 2011, the Legends Football League partnered with [[Fantazzle|Fantazzle Fantasy Sports]] to present a [[Fantasy football (American)|fantasy football]] game for the LFL.&lt;ref&gt;"Fantazzle and LFL Ready for ‘Opening Night’ Game, Friday, August 26th."

It lasted for a year, before being shutdown and repackaged in 2013 as LFL PartyDeck,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lockerdome.com/lflpartydeck|title=LFL PartyDeck}}&lt;/ref&gt; a social networking site exclusively for LFL fans, players, and coaches.

===Video game===
In 2012, the Legends Football League teamed with Japanese-based [[Yuke's]] Co. Ltd to design and develop an official LFL game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfl360.com/articles/lingerie-football-league-teams-with-yukes/|title=Lingerie Football League Teams with Top Video Game Developer Yuke's|author=Jim Wallin|accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video game still does not have a firm release date.

== Reception ==
The league has met with criticism. Critics say the league degrades female athletes through "pernicious objectification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Evans |agency=Reuters |title=New underwear league under debate |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5825Y220090904 |date=September 4, 2009 |accessdate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The league was accused in its earlier years of fining players for wearing too many clothes, as well as not paying medical bills for injured players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[The Smoking Gun]] |title=Lingerie League Gets Litigious |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/lingerie-league-gets-litigious |date=December 17, 2009 |accessdate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the league has responded, claiming that fines were given because the equipment worn was in direct conflict with the league's sponsored gear (e.g. Rawlings and Cutters, at the time).&lt;ref&gt;[url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/25/lingerie-football-players_n_512848.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the rebranding, the league now allows players to wear other clothing (bras, panties/thongs, extra padding, medical wraps) under the uniform.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Players are still required to pay for their own medical insurance and care.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The league also prohibited players from commenting on personnel matters, a rule that prompted the vast majority of the [[Toronto Triumph]], including team captain Krista Ford, to quit in protest in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;li, Anita (October 19, 2011).

==Uniforms==

The original uniforms of the Lingerie Football League consisted of an athletic bra and underwear that were more revealing than protective. The uniforms had lace and ribbons and the athletes all had to wear garter belts.

The uniforms have received extensive criticism for their revealing nature.  In an ESPN article, Sarah Spain, the co-host of espnW, wrote, "After watching these women play, I can honestly say I respect the heck out of them as athletes, but I'll still never respect the Lingerie Football League, no matter what name they give it." &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/13882332/legends-football-league-wrong-packaging-women-game|title=Legends Football League Is Still The Wrong Packaging For Women's Game|newspaper=espnW|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some players have responded ambivalently or positively to the uniforms, with one quoted as saying "I just appreciate playing football, I don’t care what they put me in", and another favoring the limited clothing, saying "It's more comfortable this way."&lt;ref name="blaze329"&gt;Smith, Emily Esfahani (2011-03-29). [http://www.theblaze.com/stories/if-nfl-strikes-lingerie-football-will-be-the-only-game-in-town/ If NFL strikes, Lingerie Football will be the only game in town]. ''[[The Blaze (blog)|The Blaze]]''. Retrieved 2011-03-29.&lt;/ref&gt; LFL players with experience in [[track and field]] competitions have noted that the typical LFL uniform is comparable to other uniforms, with Elizabeth Govrick of the Minnesota Valkyrie stating she "ran track and I was wearing, you know, stuff if not close to almost smaller than what I’m wearing out on the football field.  You take beach volleyball, you take volleyball, you take other sports where it's pretty much the same thing."&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Reg (October 17, 2011). [http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2011/10/17/inside-look-at-full-contract-competitive-lingerie-football/ Inside Look At Full-Contact, Competitive Lingerie Football]. ''WCCO''. Retrieved October 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Adrian Purnell of the Jacksonville Breeze said that the outfits are only for marketing purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/lingerie-football-in-its-own-league/story-e6frg7mf-1226326179348|title=Lingerie Football in its own league|last=Week|first=A|date=April 14, 2012|work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heather Furr, a quarterback for the Chicago Bliss said "I think with little girls watching the game ... if they can see past the uniform and see us as role models, then that's what I want."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Abbie Sullivan of the Cleveland Crush stated, "just because we play in the LFL does not mean we promote promiscuity. We are smart females. We are athletes who take care of our bodies. We are the total package."  Similarly, Toledo Crush player Marija Condric stated, "Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Sit down and watch. You’ll forget what we are wearing and you will be thinking about how hard that girl got hit on that last play."&lt;ref name="womensviewsonnews.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensviewsonnews.org/2011/10/lingerie-football-league/#sthash.6eNXOJSY.dpuf|title=Lingerie Football League – Women's Views on News|work=womensviewsonnews.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other players are quoted as viewing the uniforms as a necessary evil, with one saying "Maybe one day, girls won't have to wear lingerie to get people interested [in women's football]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.king5.com/news/Lingerie-Football-Wants-To-Start-A-Youth-League-132293863.html|title=Lingerie Football wants to start a youth league|last=Mosley|first=Tonya|date=October 21, 2011|accessdate=October 21, 2011|publisher=King}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Liz Gorman, a player with the Jacksonville Breeze, stated she'd rather wear a conventional uniform: "I mean, I don't like it. You'd rather wear full clothing. I have a bunch of scrapes on me." She also indicated a belief that the league is likely to change to conventional uniforms in the future: "You look back at basketball, you used to have to wear skirts. Obviously it's changed, they have the WNBA now. So if you look back, women's sports has constantly evolved and I think that this sports league is going to end up changing the uniform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/story/2012/03/07/sk-lingerie-football-player-1203.html|title=Skimpy outfits will end someday, lingerie football player says|date=March 7, 2012|accessdate=March 9, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308114021/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/story/2012/03/07/sk-lingerie-football-player-1203.html|archivedate=March 8, 2012|deadurl=yes|publisher=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the rebrand of the league in 2013, the league made the decision to change the uniforms. The league felt like the uniforms were too heavy on sex appeal, and traded these uniforms in for "performance wear."&lt;ref name="Business Insider" /&gt; While the US remained with the old uniforms for the 2013 season, minus the ribbons and garters, LFL Australia's debut season in the beginning of 2014 marked the debut of the new "performance wear" uniforms. The new uniforms resemble the uniforms worn by volleyball players, replacing ribbons with shoelaces on the front of the top and bottom.

The new uniforms made their debut in the US for the 2014 season. In addition to the shoelaces, the US uniforms feature brighter, more vibrant colors for the teams, with some teams getting new color schemes for the new season. White color away uniforms have been mostly replaced, with both away and home teams sporting what could be considered home color uniforms.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} White uniforms returned for the 2015 season, but only for certain teams.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
[[File:Seatle2 leggings2 updated- ind-426x640.jpg|alt=Rear view of woman wearing 2017 Legends Football League "full pants" uniform, consisting of green skin-tight leggings, bra, shoulder pads, forearm sleeves, and hockey-style helmet.|thumb|2017 Legends Football League "full pants" uniform. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfl360.com/lfl-north-america/usa/lfl-sports-outfitter-candlencaleb-kickoff-multi-year-uniform-partnership/|title=LFL AND SPORTS OUTFITTER CANDLENCALEB KICKOFF MULTI-YEAR UNIFORM PARTNERSHIP - LFL360|website=www.lfl360.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In partnership with Sleefs, the LFL announced new uniforms with new colors for the  2016 season. Numbers and logos are now printed on the uniform as opposed to previously being sewn on. In addition, the league also announced that teams will have a choice of camo or black alternates.&lt;ref name="LFL Official Facebook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfl360.com/lfl-north-america/usa/legends-football-league-sleefs-team-landmark-field-armour-deal/|title=Legends Football League And Sleefs Team On Landmark On-Field Armour Deal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced by the league that CandlenCaleb would become the new uniform provider for the LFL starting with the 2017 season. In the announcement, the league announced that, for the first time in league history, the uniforms for the last home games of the 2017 season would include long pants in lieu of the regular bikini bottom.&lt;ref name="LFL AND SPORTS OUTFITTER CANDLENCALEB KICKOFF MULTI-YEAR UNIFORM PARTNERSHIP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfl360.com/lfl-north-america/usa/lfl-sports-outfitter-candlencaleb-kickoff-multi-year-uniform-partnership/|title=LFL AND SPORTS OUTFITTER CANDLENCALEB KICKOFF MULTI-YEAR UNIFORM PARTNERSHIP}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new uniforms still lack leg, hip, or chest padding, and include the existing bra and shoulder pad combination.  The uniforms debuted as the standard outfit at the beginning of the 2018 season.  While the league, some players, and many fans were pleased with the change, other more vocal fans and players were not, prompting the league to change uniforms late season to a shorts uniform as a means of compromise. The shorts, with a look more similar to indoor volleyball shorts, are 2-3 inches longer than the original bikini bottoms. Some players have worn longer athletic shorts underneath for added protection.

==Safety==
[[File:Legends Football League Australia - (Victoria Maidens vs NSW Surge) (11888877965).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A player of NSW Surge in standard uniform with shoulder pads, knee/elbow pads, and hockey helmet]]
The league has received many complaints from players in regards to safety. Since the uniforms cover very little skin, the players are very susceptible to injury. Ex-lingerie football player Nikki Johnson was one of the many players that experienced injuries in her time in the league. Those injuries included injuries sustained from hard hits and a broken wrist that required surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/ron-kantowski/ex-lingerie-player-stumps-womens-football-safety|title=Ex-Lingerie player stumps for women's football safety|author=RON KANTOWSKI LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; She, like many other players, believed the league gave very little protection to the women by providing them with weak shoulder pads and weak helmets. Due to lack of coverage around torso, arms, and legs, they can sustain scrapes and bruises very easily.

As part of the reformation and brand change, LFL and partner Rawlings changed the shoulder pads to be more protective, including a harder plastic shell to cover the shoulders instead of just a pad. In addition, the helmets were given more padding inside and the addition of a concussion meter, meant to go off and alert the trainer of a head injury, regardless of the players saying that they are fine. This putting into place a system where, if a player goes out of action for a head injury, they must pass a physical and mental test before being allowed back on the playing field.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

At the start of the 2014 US season, LFL unveiled new helmets by Bauer, designed with a harder outer shell and more padding than the CCM helmets used the past 4 years. They are still equipped with the concussion meters. Chinstraps, while still by Russell, are thicker and have more padding.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The shoulder pads were remodeled again for the 2014 season, with more padding given to the shoulders and a thicker plate given to the chest pad. They also introduced new sturdier elbow and knee pads, in addition to new gloves designed by Champion Gloves, replacing Cutters as the leagues official glove.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

'''''Little Birds''''' is [[Anaïs Nin]]'s second published work of [[erotic literature|erotica]], which appeared in 1979 two years after her death,&lt;ref&gt;London: W. H. Allen, 1979 {{ISBN|0491022182}}--London: Penguin, 1990 {{ISBN|0-14-014663-6}} (also in Twentieth Century Classics, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;
but was apparently written in the early 1940s when she was part of a group "writing pornography for a dollar a day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Master of the red Martini, a review of "The Chameleon Poet: A Life of George Barker" by Robert Fraser |author=Ian Sansom |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2002-03-02 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/mar/02/biography.highereducation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is a collection of thirteen short stories. The sexual topics covered are quite varied, ranging from [[pedophilia]] to [[lesbianism]], but linked by an interest in female subjectivity&lt;ref&gt;A. T. Salvatore ed., ''Anaïs Nin's Narratives'' (2004) p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; and in the dialectic of discourse and intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;P. Jason, ''The Critical Response to Anaïs Nin'' (1996) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the same characters that appear in ''[[Delta of Venus]]'', her first published book of erotica, re-occur here.

==Title and themes==

The 'little birds' of the title story refer both to the actual birds used by its [[Exhibitionism|exhibitionist]] protagonist to [[Grooming (sexology)|attract]] young schoolgirls to his attic, and (metaphorically) to the girls' flight when he finally [[Indecent exposure|exposes]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;Anaïs Nin, ''Delta of Venus &amp; Little Birds'' (1996) p. 294-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In other stories, Nin calls into question the objectifying tendencies of the [[male gaze]]; both male and female complicity in [[Self-defeating personality disorder|masochism]]; and the pornographic genre itself through her subtle subversion.&lt;ref&gt;A. T. Salvatore ed., ''Anaïs Nin's Narratives'' (2004) p. x, p. 18 and p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions of writing==

While writing her erotica, and organising that of her fellow writers such as [[George Barker (poet)|George Barker]], Nin referred to herself jokingly as the "madam of this snobbish literary house of prostitution" for a client who examined sexual activity "to the exclusion of aspects which are the fuel that ignites it. Intellectual, imaginative, romantic, emotional."&lt;ref name="Delta_Preface"/&gt; In her 1976 preface to ''Delta of Venus'' she said "I had a feeling that Pandora's box contained the mysteries of woman's sensuality, so different from man's and for which man's language was inadequate.... Here in the erotica I was writing to entertain, under pressure from a client who wanted me to 'leave out the poetry.' I believed that my style was derived from a reading of men's works. For this reason I long felt that I had compromised my feminine self. I put the erotica aside. Rereading it these many years later, I see that my own voice was not completely suppressed. In numerous passages I was intuitively using a woman's language, seeing sexual experience from a woman's point of view. I finally decided to release the erotica for publication because it shows the beginning efforts of a woman in a world that had been the domain of men."&lt;ref name="Delta_Preface"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Anaïs Nin]] |title=[[Delta of Venus]] |chapter=Preface |date=September 1976 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5knBgSwxc |archivedate=October 25, 2009 |chapter-url=http://www.geocities.com/arsenio_grilo/a_nin_1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susie Bright]] saw the results as forming part of a pioneering feminist erotica.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Bright ed, ''Totally Heterotica'' (1995) p. 2 and p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

''Maxine Hong Kingston: A Critical Companion''. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; October 27, 1940) is a  [[Chinese American]] author and Professor Emerita at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where she graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in English in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kingston, Maxine Hong|last=Svetich|first=Kella|work=The Oxford Encyclopedia of American Literature|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780195156539|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kingston has written three novels and several works of non-fiction about the experiences of Chinese Americans.

Kingston has contributed to the [[feminist]] movement with such works as her memoir ''[[The Woman Warrior]]'', which discusses [[gender]] and [[ethnicity]] and how these concepts affect the lives of women. She has received several awards for her contributions to [[Chinese American literature]], including the [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]] in 1981 for ''[[China Men]]''.&lt;ref name=nba1981&gt;[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1981 "National Book Awards – 1981"].

Dartmouth College.&lt;/ref&gt; She has also garnered criticism from female Asian scholars for her "over-exaggeration of Asian American female oppression".&lt;ref name=fong/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, David Leiwei (2000). ''Imagining the Nation: Asian American Literature and Cultural Consent''. p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Kingston was born Maxine Ting Ting Hong on October 27, 1940, in [[Stockton, California]], to first-generation [[Chinese immigrants]], Tom and Ying Lan Hong. She was the third of eight children and the eldest of the six children born in the United States.

In [[China]], Tom Hong worked as a professional scholar and teacher in his home village of [[Xinhui|Sun Woi]], near [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. In 1925, Tom left China for the United States in search of better prospects. However, the U.S. in the early twentieth century was plagued with racist employment legislation and had little desire for a well-educated Chinese immigrant, and Tom was thus relegated to working menial jobs. He saved his earnings and became the manager of an illegal gambling house, which led him to get arrested numerous times. Tom "was canny about his arrests, never giving his real name and—because he apparently sensed that quite a few people thought that all Chinese looked alike—inventing a different name for each arrest. Consequently, he never acquired a police record in his own name."&lt;ref&gt;Huntley, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Tom was able to bring his wife over in 1940, and shortly thereafter, Kingston was born; she was named "Maxine" after a blonde patron at the gambling house who was always remarkably lucky.&lt;ref name=huntley/&gt;

Kingston was drawn to writing at a young age and won a five-dollar prize from "Girl Scout Magazine" for an essay she wrote titled "I Am an American." She majored in [[engineering]] at Berkeley before switching to [[English studies|English]]. In 1962 Kingston married [[Earll Kingston]], an actor, and began a high school teaching career. The two began a family the following year with the birth of their son Joseph Lawrence Chung Mei. In 1965–1967, Maxine taught English and mathematics at [[Sunset High School (Hayward, California)|Sunset High School]] in [[Hayward, California]].&lt;ref name=eNotes /&gt; After relocating to Hawaii in 1967 Maxine began writing extensively, finally completing and publishing her first book, ''The Woman Warrior: Memoir of a Girlhood Among Ghosts'', in 1976. She began teaching English at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawai'i at Mānoa]] that same year. By 1981 she had moved on to teach at Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maxine Hong Kingston |url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/canam/kingston.htm |publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Pembroke]] |accessdate=30 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408001505/http://www2.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/canam/kingston.htm |archivedate=8 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her works often reflect on her cultural heritage and blend fiction with non-fiction. Among her works are ''[[The Woman Warrior]]'' (1976), awarded the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for Nonfiction, and ''China Men'' (1980), awarded the National Book Award.&lt;ref name=nba1981 /&gt; She has written one novel, ''[[Tripmaster Monkey]],'' a story depicting a character based on the mythical Chinese character [[Sun Wu Kong]]. Her most recent books are ''[[To Be The Poet]]'' and ''[[The Fifth Book of Peace]].''

A documentary produced by Gayle K. Yamada, ''Maxine Hong Kingston: Talking Story,'' was released in 1990. Featuring notable Asian American authors such as [[Amy Tan]] and [[David Henry Hwang]], it explored Kingston's life, paying particular attention to her commentary on cultural heritage and both sexual and racial oppression. The production was awarded the CINE Golden Eagle in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cine.org/golden-eagle-archive.php CINE Golden Eagle Award Archives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211061306/http://www.cine.org/golden-eagle-archive.php |date=2009-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kingston also participated in the production of [[Bill Moyers]]' PBS historical documentary, ''Becoming American: The Chinese Experience''.

Kingston was awarded the 1997 [[National Humanities Medal]] by [[President of the United States]] [[Bill Clinton]]. She was a member of the committee to choose the design for the [[California]] commemorative quarter.

Kingston was arrested on International Women's Day (March 8) in 2003. Participating in an anti-war protest in Washington, D.C. that was coordinated by the women-initiated organization Code Pink, Kingston refused to leave the street after being instructed to do so by local police forces. She shared a jail cell with authors [[Alice Walker]] and [[Terry Tempest Williams]] who were also participants in the demonstration. Kingston's anti-war stance has significantly trickled into her work; she has stated that writing ''The Fifth Book of Peace'' was initiated and inspired by growing up during [[World War II]].

Kingston was honored as a 175th Speaker Series writer at [[Emma Willard School]] in September 2005.  In April, 2007, Kingston was awarded the Northern California Book Award Special Award in Publishing for ''Veterans of War, Veterans of Peace'' (2006), an anthology which she edited.

In July, 2014, Kingston was awarded the 2013 [[National Medal of Arts]] by [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arts.gov/honors/medals/maxine-hong-kingston|title=National Medal of Arts – Maxine Hong Kingston|last=|first=|date=|website=National Endowment for the Arts|publisher=|access-date=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==

In an interview published in ''American Literary History'', Kingston disclosed her admiration for [[Walt Whitman]], [[Virginia Woolf]], and [[William Carlos Williams]], who were inspirational influences for her work, shaping her analysis of [[gender studies]]. Kingston said of Walt Whitman's work,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I like the rhythm of his language and the freedom and the wildness of it. It's so American. And also his vision of a new kind of human being that was going to be formed in this country—although he never specifically said Chinese—ethnic Chinese also—I'd like to think he meant all kinds of people. And also I love that throughout ''Leaves of Grass'' he always says 'men and women,' 'male and female.' He's so different from other writers of his time, and even of this time. Even a hundred years ago he included women and he always used [those phrases], 'men and women,' 'male and female.'&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/489888 ''American Literary History'', Vol. 3, No. 4 (Winter, 1991), pp. 782–791]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kingston named the main character of ''[[Tripmaster Monkey]]'', Wittman Ah Sing, after Walt Whitman.

Of Woolf, Kingston stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I found that whenever I come to a low point in my life or in my work, when I read Virginia Woolf's ''Orlando'', that always seems to get my life force moving again. I just love the way she can make one character live for four hundred years, and that Orlando can be a man. Orlando can be a woman. Virginia broke through constraints of time, of gender, of culture.&lt;ref name="jstor.org" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, Kingston's praise of William Carlos Williams expresses her appreciation of his seemingly genderless work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I love ''In the American Grain'' because it does the same thing. Abraham Lincoln is a 'mother' of our country. He talks about this wonderful woman walking through the battlefields with her beard and shawl. I find that so freeing, that we don't have to be constrained to being just one ethnic group or one gender-- both [Woolf and Williams] make me feel that I can now write as a man, I can write as a black person, as a white person; I don't have to be restricted by time and physicality.&lt;ref name="jstor.org" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==
Though Kingston's work is acclaimed by some, it has also received criticism, especially from some members of the [[Chinese American]] community. Playwright and novelist [[Frank Chin]] has severely criticized Kingston's ''[[The Woman Warrior]]'', stating that Kingston deliberately tarnished the authenticity of Chinese tradition by altering traditional stories and myths to appeal to white sensitivities.&lt;ref name=dartmouth/&gt; Chin has accused Kingston of "liberally adapting [traditional stories] to collude with white racist [[stereotype]]s and to invent a 'fake' Chinese-American culture that is more palatable to the mainstream."&lt;ref&gt;[http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/LitCrit/jama62549/FJ3533950004 "Frank Chin (1940–)." ''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. Ed. Jeffrey W. Hunter. Vol. 135. Detroit: Gale Group, 2001. 150–202. Literature Criticism Online. Gale. St. John's University Library. 10 April 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kingston commented on her critics' opinions in a 1990 interview in which she stated that men believe that minority women writers have "achieved success by collaborating with the white racist establishment," by "pander[ing] to the white taste for feminist writing... It's a one-sided argument because the women don't answer. We let them say those things because we don't want to be divisive."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/467101 Chin, Marilyn. "A MELUS Interview: Maxine Hong Kingston." MELUS, Vol. 16, No. 4, Toward the Multiculture (Winter, 1989 – Winter, 1990), pp. 57–74]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, several female Asian scholars have also criticized Kingston's work. Shirley Geok-Lin Lim, a professor of English at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], stated that Kingston's "representations of patriarchal, abusive Chinese history were playing to a desire to look at Asians as an inferior spectacle".&lt;ref&gt;Jaggi, Maya (2003). "Profile: Maxine Hong Kingston". ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Katheryn M. Fong took exception to Kingston's "distortion of the histories of China and Chinese America" and denounced Kingston for her "over-exaggerated" depiction of Chinese and Chinese American cultural misogyny.&lt;ref name=fong&gt;Fong, Katheryn (1977). "An Open Letter/Review". ''Bulletin for Concerned Asian Scholars''.&lt;/ref&gt; "The problem is that non-Chinese are reading [Kingston's] fiction as true accounts of Chinese and Chinese American history," wrote Fong, who noted that her own father "was very loving" towards her.&lt;ref name=fong/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Christopher (2001).

'''Media evaluation''' is a discipline of the [[social science]]s and centres on the analysis of media content rating the exposure using a number of pre-designated criteria commonly including tonal value and presence of key messages. It is said to be one of the fastest growing areas of [[mass communications]] research. 

[[The International Association for Measurement and Evaluation of Communication (AMEC)]] is the industry appointed trade body for companies and individuals involved in research, measurement and evaluation in editorial media coverage and related communications issues. To be a full member of [http://www.amecorg.com/ AMEC], companies must be able to a) offer comprehensive media evaluation, research and interpretation services, b) been in business for at least two years and c) have media evaluation turnover in excess of £150,000 when applying.  In addition all companies abide by a strict code of ethics and must implement tight quality control procedures.  These conditions ensure that the media avaluation services offered are all to the very highest standard. Further detailed information on the industry  is available from AMEC's [http://www.amecorg.com/ website]. Another organisation is the Commission on Public Relations Measurement &amp; Evaluation [https://web.archive.org/web/20080517071402/http://www.instituteforpr.org/about/measurement_commission/] which was formed under the auspices of the Institute for Public Relations in 1998. The Commission exists to establish standards and methods for public relations research and measurement, and to issue authoritative best-practices white papers.

'''''Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game''''' is a book by [[Michael Lewis]], published in 2003, about the [[Oakland Athletics]] baseball team and its [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Billy Beane]]. Its focus is the team's [[Analytics|analytical]], evidence-based, [[sabermetric]] approach to assembling a competitive [[baseball]] team despite Oakland's small budget. [[Moneyball (film)|A film]] based on the book, starring [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Jonah Hill]], was released in 2011.

==Synopsis==
The central premise of ''Moneyball'' is that the collective wisdom of baseball insiders (including players, managers, coaches, scouts, and the [[front office]]) over the past century is subjective and often flawed. Statistics such as [[stolen base]]s, [[run batted in|runs batted in]], and [[batting average]], typically used to gauge players, are relics of a 19th-century view of the game and the statistics available at that time. Before sabermetrics was introduced to baseball, teams were dependent on the skills of their scouts to find and evaluate players. Scouts are experienced in the sport, usually having been players or coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Study of Sabermetrics in Major League Baseball: The Impact of Moneyball on Free Agent Salaries|url=http://olinblog.wustl.edu/wp-content/uploads/AStudyofSabermetricsinMajorLeagueBaseball.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book argues that the Oakland A's' front office took advantage of more analytical gauges of player performance to field a team that could better compete against richer competitors in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB).

Rigorous statistical analysis had demonstrated that [[on-base percentage]] and [[slugging percentage]] are better indicators of offensive success, and the A's became convinced that these qualities were cheaper to obtain on the open market than more historically valued qualities such as speed and contact. These observations often flew in the face of conventional baseball wisdom and the beliefs of many baseball scouts and executives.

By re-evaluating their strategy in this way, the [[2002 Oakland Athletics season|2002 Athletics]], with approximately $44 million in salary, were competitive with larger market teams such as the [[New York Yankees]], who spent over $125 million in payroll that season. Because of its smaller budget, Oakland had to find players undervalued by the market, and their system has proven itself thus far. The approach brought the A's to the playoffs in 2002 and 2003.

Lewis explored several themes in the book, such as insiders vs. outsiders (established traditionalists vs. upstart proponents of [[sabermetrics]]), the democratization of information causing a flattening of hierarchies, and "the ruthless drive for efficiency that [[capitalism]] demands". The book also touches on Oakland's underlying economic need to stay ahead of the curve; as other teams begin mirroring Beane's strategies to evaluate offensive talent, diminishing the Athletics' advantage, Oakland begins looking for other undervalued baseball skills, such as defensive capabilities.

[[File:MONEYBALLchart.png|thumb|left|467px|Distribution of team salaries in 2002. Team salaries ranged from about $35 million (the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]]) to about $120 million (the [[New York Yankees]])&lt;br&gt; The [[Oakland Athletics]] had the third-lowest team payroll in the league (about $40 million) marginally higher than that of the [[Montreal Expos]], whose franchise was transferred to the Washington Nationals in 2005.]]

''Moneyball'' also touches on the A's' methods of prospect selection. Sabermetricians argue that a [[college baseball]] player's chance of MLB success is much higher than a traditional high school draft pick. Beane maintains that high draft picks spent on high school prospects, regardless of talent or physical potential as evaluated by traditional scouting, are riskier than those spent on more polished college players. Lewis cites A's minor leaguer [[Jeremy Bonderman]], drafted out of high school in 2001 over Beane's objections, as an example of the type of draft pick Beane would avoid. Bonderman had all of the traditional "tools" that scouts look for, but thousands of such players have been signed by MLB organizations out of high school over the years and failed to develop. Lewis explores the A's approach to the [[2002 Major League Baseball draft|2002 MLB draft]], when the team had a run of early picks. The book documents Beane's often tense discussions with his scouting staff (who favored traditional subjective evaluation of potential rather than objective sabermetrics) in preparation for the draft to the actual draft, which defied all expectations and was considered at the time a wildly successful (if unorthodox) effort by Beane.

''Moneyball'' traces the history of the sabermetric movement back to such people as [[Bill James]] (now a member of the [[Boston Red Sox]] [[front office]]) and [[Craig R. Wright]]. Lewis explores how James's seminal ''[[Baseball Abstract]]'', published annually from the late 1970s through the late 1980s, influenced many of the young, up-and-coming baseball minds that are now joining the ranks of baseball management.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Impact==
''Moneyball'' has entered baseball's lexicon; teams that value sabermetrics are often said to be playing "''Moneyball''." Baseball traditionalists, in particular some scouts and media members, decry the sabermetric revolution and have disparaged ''Moneyball'' for emphasizing sabermetrics over more traditional methods of player evaluation. Nevertheless, ''Moneyball'' changed the way many major league front offices do business. In its wake, teams such as the [[New York Mets]], [[New York Yankees]], [[San Diego Padres]], [[St. Louis Cardinals]], [[Boston Red Sox]], [[Washington Nationals]], [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], [[Cleveland Indians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolner |first=Keith |url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=6187 |title=Articles &amp;#124; Aim For The Head: Aim For the Front Office |publisher=Baseball Prospectus |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]  have hired full-time [[Sabermetrician|sabermetric analysts]].

When the Mets hired [[Sandy Alderson]] &amp;ndash; Beane's predecessor and mentor with the A's &amp;ndash; as their general manager after the 2010 season, and hired Beane's former associates [[Paul DePodesta]] and [[J.P. Ricciardi]] to the front office, the team was jokingly referred to as the "Moneyball Mets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nymag.com/news/sports/games/sandy-alderson-2011-4/ |title = The Moneyball Mets |publisher = [[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date = 25 March 2011 |accessdate = 2011-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Oakland A's in the 1990s, the Mets have been directed by their ownership to slash payroll. Under Alderson's tenure, the team payroll dropped below $100 million per year from 2012 to 2014, and the Mets reached the [[2015 World Series]] (defeating MLB's highest-payroll team, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], en route).

Lewis has acknowledged that the book's success may have hurt the Athletics' fortunes as other teams accepted sabermetrics, reducing Oakland's edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/09/18/SP3J1L571K.DTL&amp;ao=all |title = Michael Lewis on A's 'Moneyball' legacy |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date = 18 September 2011 |accessdate = 2011-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daryl Morey]]'s own unorthodox approaches in the NBA have been called "Moreyball".

Since the book's publication and success, Lewis has discussed plans for a sequel to ''Moneyball'' called ''Underdogs'', revisiting the players and their relative success several years into their careers, although only four players from the 2002 draft played much at the Major League level.

==People discussed in the book==
''Moneyball'' also covers the lives and careers of several baseball personalities. The central one is [[Billy Beane]], whose failed playing career is contrasted with wildly optimistic predictions by scouts.

Players and people discussed in ''Moneyball'':

===Oakland farm system===
[[Image:Swisher.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Nick Swisher]], the prospect the traditional scouts and statisticians agreed upon.]]
*[[Barry Zito]] – [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002]] [[American League|AL]] [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young winner]], part of the "Big 3" with Mulder and Hudson (below)

*[[Billy Koch]] – 2002 AL Relief Pitcher of the Year
*[[Chad Bradford]]
*[[Jim Mecir]]
*[[Ricardo Rincón]]
*[[Mike Magnante]]

===Other players===
[[File:KevinYouklis.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Kevin Youkilis]]]]
*[[Kevin Youkilis]] – referred to in the book as the "Greek God of Walks". Youkilis was drafted in 2001 by the [[Boston Red Sox]] and heavily desired by Beane, who tried to snare him via a failed three-team trade discussed in the book.
*[[Prince Fielder]] – son of former [[slugging percentage|slugger]] [[Cecil Fielder]], drafted in 2002 year by the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. Claimed by Beane to be "too fat" even for the A's.
*B. J. Upton, now known by his birth name of [[Melvin Upton, Jr.]] – cited as an example of "bad [[high school]]" draft pick.
*[[Scott Kazmir]] – cited as an example of teams' – in this case the [[New York Mets]] – foolishness in drafting high school [[pitcher]]s because of the difficulty in projecting their future, as opposed to college players.
*[[Jamie Moyer]] – then with the [[Seattle Mariners]]
*[[Ray Durham]] – traded to the Oakland A's in the middle of 2002, cited as a potent base-stealer and "rent-a-player": an impending free agent who would likely attract large offers from other clubs with larger available payrolls than Oakland's while leaving Oakland with draft picks in the next year's draft, a rule since abolished with the 2011 [[Major League Baseball Collective Bargaining Agreement]]. Durham would eventually sign with the [[San Francisco Giants]].
*[[Terrence Long]]
*[[Erik Hiljus]]
*[[David Justice]]
*[[Jeremy Giambi]]
*[[Alex Rodriguez]] – Beane compares A-Rod's stats to those of [[Eric Chavez]].

== Reception ==
[[Richard Thaler|Richard H. Thaler]] of the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and Cass R. Sunstein of the University of Chicago Law School described the book as a "sensation... Lewis has a wonderful story to tell, and he tells it wonderfully... Lewis also raises some serious puzzles that he does not resolve, and his account has some large and perhaps profound implications that he does not much explore."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/61123/whos-first|title=Who's On First|date=2003-09-01|website=New Republic|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Haglund of [[Slate Magazine|Slate]] and [[Jonah Keri]] of [[Grantland]] have both criticized the book for glossing over key young talent acquired through the draft and signed internationally. Specifically, they have argued that the book ignores the pitching trio of [[Tim Hudson]], [[Mark Mulder]], and [[Barry Zito]], as well as position players such as [[Eric Chavez]] and [[Miguel Tejada]], all of whom were discovered via traditional scouting methodology and were key contributors to the success of the 2002 Athletics. In 2002, Barry Zito received the [[AL Cy Young Award]] and Miguel Tejada received the [[AL MVP Award]].

==Film==
{{Main article|Moneyball (film)}}
A movie based on the book was released in 2011. Actor [[Brad Pitt]] stars as [[Billy Beane]], while [[Jonah Hill]] plays a fictional character based on [[Paul DePodesta]]; [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] plays A's manager [[Art Howe]]. [[Academy Award]]-winning screenwriter [[Steve Zaillian]] was hired to write the script, and [[Steven Soderbergh]] was slated to direct, replacing [[David Frankel]].&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Tatiana. [http://www.variety.com/VR1117994175.html "Columbia pitches ''Moneyball'' to Pitt", Variety (October 16, 2008).]&lt;/ref&gt; But in June 2009, because of conflicts over a revised script by Soderbergh, Sony put the movie on hold just days before it was scheduled to begin shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4278999 |title="Benched: 'Moneyball' Flick on Hold at Last Minute", Associated Press (June 22, 2009) |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2009-06-22 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soderbergh was eventually let go.

''Moneyball'' was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].

==In popular culture==
The book is parodied in the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[MoneyBART]]", in which [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] manages [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s [[Little League]] baseball team using sabermetric principles. [[Bill James]] made an appearance in this episode.

The '''New Left''' ({{zh|c=新左派}}) in the [[People's Republic of China]] is a school of intellectual thought that is critical of [[capitalism]] and aspects of the [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|Chinese economic reforms]] and in favour of elements of [[Maoist]]-style socialism, which includes a significant role for state planning, the preservation of state-owned enterprises, and a renewed spirit of collectivism. It is also correlated with increased Chinese nationalism after a period of 'low-profile' presence on the world stage during [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s era. It is seen as a response to problems faced by China during its modernization drive since the 1980s, which has led to mounting social inequality between the coast and the hinterlands, as well as between the rich and the poor. 

Its relationship with Maoism and capitalism is complex. Some schools of thought suggest that the New Left wants to return to the mass political movements of the Mao Zedong era and an abandonment of capitalist practices, while others believe that it blends the open markets of capitalism while still maintaining socialist aspects of the community, particularly in rural China.&lt;ref&gt;Cui, Zhiyuan. "How to Comprehend Today's China." Contemporary Chinese Thought. 37.4 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Chinese New Left's origins lie mainly in scholarly people and other intellectuals. They tend to think that the social problems faced by China are caused not only by capitalist [[loophole]]s and [[Political corruption|corruption]], but also by the excesses and oversights of [[Mao Zedong]]'s era.  While opposed to capitalism, New Leftists recognize both the strengths and weaknesses of capitalism, and recognize its major and necessary influence on China.  Although the capitalist system is fixed in the West, China has the opportunity to learn from Western mistakes as its system is still in flux.   [[Cui Zhiyuan]], a leading New Leftist intellectual, believes that it is imperative that socialism and capitalism are not viewed as opposing one another.&lt;ref name="Mishra, 2012"&gt;Mishra, Panka. "China's New Leftist." New York Times [New York] 15 010 2006, Magazine n. pag. Web. 9 May. 2012. &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/magazine/15leftist.html?pagewanted=all&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang Xudong has said that "an advocate for New Deal- style economic and social policies in China was considered to be a liberal in the 1980s, but 'New Left' by the century's end."  This overlap suggests that the ideals set forth by New Leftism most strongly resemble the "democratic socialism" and "humanistic Marxism" of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Xudong, "The Making of the Post-Tiananmen Intellectual Field: A Critical Overview."  In Whither China?  Intellectual Politics in Contemporary Chin, ed. Xudong Zhang (1-75).  Durham: Duke University Press, 2001, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gan, Yang "Zhongguo ziyouzuopai de youlai" (Origins of the Chinese Liberal Left).  In Sichao: Zhongguo 'xinzuopai' jiqi yingxiang (Ideological Trends: The Chinese "New Left" and its Influence), ed. Gong Yang (110-120).  Beijing: Zhongguo shehui kexue chubanshe, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name was first applied in the late 1990s.  While the term "New Left" implies a belief in [[Maoism|Mao's interpretation of Marxism]], the school's most well known thinker, [[Wang Hui (intellectual)|Wang Hui]], explains the origin of the term:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first stirring of a more critical view of official marketization goes back to 1993... But it wasn't until 1997-98 that the label New Left became widely used, to indicate positions outside the consensus.  Liberals adopted the term, relying on the negative identification of the 'Left' with late Maoism, to imply that these must be a throw-back to the [[Cultural Revolution]].  Up until then, they had more frequently attacked anyone who criticised the rush to marketization as a 'conservative' - this is how [[Cui Zhiyuan]] was initially described, for example.  From 1997 onwards, this altered.  The standard accusatory term became 'New Left'...&lt;ref name="OCMP"&gt;''One China, Many Paths'', edited by [[Chaohua Wang]], page 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Actually, people like myself have always been reluctant to accept this label, pinned on us by our adversaries. Partly this is because we have no wish to be associated with the [[Cultural Revolution]], or for that matter with what might be called the 'Old Left' of the reform-era CCP. But it is also because the term [[New Left]] is a Western one, with a very distinct set of connotations – generational and political – in Europe and America. Our historical context is Chinese, not Western, and it is doubtful whether a category imported so explicitly from the West could be helpful in today's China.&lt;ref name="OCMP"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Intellectuals reacted against 'leftism' in the 80s, blaming it for all of China's problems, and right-wing radicals use the words 'New Left' to discredit us, make us look like remnants from the Maoist days.&lt;ref name="Mishra, 2012" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Human rights==
{{Further|Human rights in China}}
A critical value of New Leftists is the belief in the universality of human rights. Hu Ping argues that the most important of all human rights is that of freedom of speech.  During the [[Great Leap Forward]] production of grain decreased and it became evident that many people began to starve.  Simultaneously, as reported by the newspapers, the next harvest would present an ample yield.  Hu wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At that time, people on the verge of starvation were not allowed to call out that they were starving.  Many people who publicly did this were labeled counterrevolutionaries.  It was not permitted to mention that the many millions of people who died had died from starvation.  Many officials who reported to higher levels that people were dying from starvation were labeled rightist opportunists.  Today when one mentions freedom of speech some people believe that this is just something of special value to intellectuals, especially those intellectuals who are not content with their lot.  The tragic example of the three-year-long famine is the most forceful rebuttal of such a view.&lt;ref&gt;Angle, Stephen, and Maria Svensson, ed. The Chinese Human Rights Reader. 1. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, Inc., 2001. 430. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Groups==
A sub-group of this strand of New Leftists are more [[Far left|radical]], adhering to [[Marxism]] as originally interpreted by Mao and as executed during approximately the first twenty years of the PRC's existence. They believe firmly that China is, and has been for some time, moving away from the [[communist]] path, which has resulted and will continue to result in the rise of [[capitalism|capitalists]] who will further exploit [[peasant]]s and workers, as they did in China before 1949. Similarly to the worldwide [[Maoist]] movement, this strain of New Leftists are against the Chinese government's policy of "openness" and [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]]; correspondingly, they do not consider [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Cultural Revolution]] and [[Great Leap Forward]] to have been wrong-headed in an ideological sense, even if they do oppose the actual ''outcomes'' and on-the-ground policies of those early experiments.

These New Leftists are also against capitalist "so-called" [[democracy]] and look favorably on the "revolutionary [[Maoism]]" of a generation ago, in contrast to the corruption and money-centeredness they see in current Chinese society.  Many of these New Leftists also regret the erosion of [[guarantee]]d [[employment]], [[education]], [[health care]], and other former gains of the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] that have been largely lost in the new [[Profit (economics)|profit]]-driven economy. The New Left collection of Chinese tend to look at themselves, like most [[socialist]]s, as defenders of the people against a dehumanizing and inherently corrupt capitalist system.

==History==
===Zhengzhou incident===
On December 24, 2004, four Chinese [[protest]]ers were sentenced to three-year prison terms for distributing leaflets entitled "Mao Forever Our Leader" at a gathering in [[Zhengzhou]] honoring Mao Zedong on the anniversary of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0105commentary.htm Maoists in China Get Three Year Prison Sentences for Leafleting: A Report on the Case of the Zhengzhou Four], ''[[Monthly Review]]'', January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Attacking the current leadership as "[[Imperialism|imperialist]] [[Marxist revisionism|revisionists]]," the leaflets called on lower-level [[Professional revolutionaries|cadre]] to "change (The Party's) current [[Party line (politics)|line]] and to revert to the [[Socialism|socialist]] road." The Zhengzhou incident is one of the first manifestations of public nostalgia for the Mao era to make it to the international press, although it is far from clear whether these feelings are widespread. In any case, it is an example of Marxist Chinese New Leftism in action.

Chinese New Leftists are often criticised by liberal [[intellectual]]s, such as [[Liu Junning]], who consider China not to be liberal ''enough'', both economically and politically. These liberals tend to think that [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and the widening gap between rich and the poor are serious problems, but that these problems exist in every [[Developing world|developing]] country. Democracy and personal freedoms are seen by these liberals to be important for China, although perhaps not attainable in the near future. These liberals largely consider themselves to be classical, not modern, liberals. The liberal critics and Chinese New Leftists have fiercely debated throughout the mid-1990s and early 2000s. At the heart of this debate is the conflict between liberal representative democracy, based on the Anglo-American political tradition, the English [[Glorious Revolution]] and the [[American Revolution]], and the [[Scottish enlightenment]], which is favoured by the Liberals; and conceptions of [[direct democracy]], based on the [[Jacobin]] traditions of the [[French Revolution]], the French enlightenment, in particular [[Rousseau]] and the Maoist [[New Democracy|socialist-democratic]] concept of the [[mass line]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}.

===The Maoist Communist Party of China===
In 2008, a group of workers and students formed the political party [[Maoist Communist Party of China]], a underground, non-recognized political party that opposed the government of [[Communist Party of China|The Communist Party of China]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=After India, Nepal, China under Maoist threat? - Times of India |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/After-India-Nepal-China-under-Maoist-threat/articleshow/6446130.cms?referral=PM |work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=中国出了个中国毛泽东主义共产党 |url=https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/mao-01302009234757.html |work=Radio Free Asia |language=zh-cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Party's alleged platform was released on the internet titled, ''The Ten Declarations of the Maoist Communist Party of China'', in which the party questions the legitimacy of the CPC and advocates a reversal of the [[Deng Xiaoping]] reforms and a return to [[socialism]]. 

===Nanjie Village and Land Reform===
On Friday 13 May 2011, [[National Public Radio]]'s website published a story about [[Nanjie Village]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5583917&lt;/ref&gt; saying that it is a prime example of recent "re-collectivizations" inspired by Mao's original ideas and paying active tribute to him. "The furniture and appliances in each home are identical, including the big red clocks with Chairman Mao's head, radiating psychedelic colors to the tune "The East Is Red." [Villager] Huang Zunxian owns virtually nothing in his apartment. The possessions are owned by the collective, right down to the couch cushions." The report also says that "Some villages around the country have followed Nanjie's example and re-collectivized," but doesn't give any examples of other such villages.

In the 1990s, rural industry began to stagnate and China's immense peasant population became viewed as a hindrance to China's development.  Popular demand for further modernization, urbanization, and marketization, began to outweigh the successes seen by the previous instated [[Township and Village Enterprises]].  Cui Zhiyuan and Gan Yang began to instate small rural industries and collective not only to mediate the increasing socioeconomic gap, but also as an alternative to the model of large scale capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Lance.

Since 1996, Hegang city has had the most laid-off workers, yet has registered the highest rate of economic growth in China.  [[Cui Zhiyuan]] suggests that the cause of this phenomenon is due to its utilization of "combining public land ownership and the market."  In this way, Hegang city has focused on stimulating its real estate market as a means to stimulate the development of related industries.&lt;ref&gt;Cui, Zhiyuan. "How to Comprehend Today's China." Contemporary Chinese Thought. 37.4 (2006): 5. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the established Chinese Communist Party's current ideology, it is significant that the idea of privatising China's countryside land outright has not so far been accepted, instead keeping it in public hands. Currently, most Chinese non-urban land is ''used'' privately but cannot be sold, unlike Chinese urban property.

In 2008, the Third Session of the Seventeenth Central Committee of the Party ({{zh|s=中国共产党第十七届中央委员会第三次全体会议}}) initiated a new round of land privatization reforms,&lt;ref&gt;The resolution reached on the rural land reform, in simplified Chinese can be found at &lt;http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2008-10/19/content_10218932_1.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; but these measures were ultimately quite limited, for the transfer and trading of land remains ambiguous and not "officially endorsed and encouraged".&lt;ref&gt;Jialin Zhang, China's Slow-motion Land Reform,  Hoover Institution, Stanford University, Feb 1, 2010, available on &lt;http://www.hoover.org/publications/policy-review/article/5383&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guangzhou Incident===
In November 2017 a group of Maoist students (e.g. [[Zhang Yunfan]]) and workers was arrested in Guangzhou for organizing Maoist salon.&lt;ref&gt;https://socialistworker.org/2018/02/28/justice-for-the-eight-comrades&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2125541/chinese-scholars-sign-open-letter-calling-release&lt;/ref&gt;

===The JASIC Protests===
A number of Maoist and Marxist leaning students participated in [[Jasic Incident|The Jasic Incident]] in 2018, protesting in favor of the workers of the factory and advocated for workers rights.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Young Marxists are going missing in China after protesting for workers |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/13/asia/china-student-marxist-missing-intl/index.html |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students formed [[JASIC Workers Solidarity Group]] which included [[#metoo]] advocate [[Yue Xin (Activist)|Yue Xin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zhe |first1=Parson Young and Zhan Dou |title=China: JASIC workers’ struggle reveals rising class tensions |url=https://www.marxist.com/china-jasic-workers-struggle-reveals-rising-class-tensions.htm |work=www.marxist.com |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fears for young Marxist activist missing after police raid in China |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2167955/fears-young-marxist-activist-missing-after-police-raid-china |work=South China Morning Post |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;On October 11th, fifty student advocates were arrested, their whereabouts are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Young Marxists are going missing in China after protesting for workers |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/13/asia/china-student-marxist-missing-intl/index.html |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political suppression has expanded to universities, factories and the wider public.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2173090/chinese-campus-crackdown-young-marxist-activists-expands-major&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2593">'''Pete and Dud''' were characters played by the comedians and entertainers [[Peter Cook]] and [[Dudley Moore]]. 

The dialogue format originated in 1964 when Dudley Moore invited Peter Cook to appear in a television performance. Cook scripted a conversation between two men from [[Dagenham]] wearing [[flat cap]]s. This proved to be very popular with television audiences and the partnership was continued during the series ''[[Not Only... But Also]]''.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |title=Ban them! How Pete and Dud fell foul of the law yet still escaped prosecution |author=Alan Travis |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 March 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/mar/16/peter-cook-dudley-moore-dpp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pete is a know-it-all and would-be intellectual, very much in the spirit of [[E. L. Wisty]], and Dud is a put-upon Herbert in a subservient role, who tries to impress Pete with his knowledge. Neither of them has any real sense.

The "Dagenham Dialogues" between the two ranged from paintings (Pete finds the [[Mona Lisa]] snooty, and the bottoms of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]'s nudes seem to follow them around the room), reasons why [[gecko]]s do not live long and being annoyed by film stars (including "bloody [[Greta Garbo]]" and "bloody [[Anna Magnani]]") pestering them for romance.

During the 1970s, Cook and Moore used a similar formula for the more adult [[Derek and Clive]] recordings.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Pete just wasn't big enough to cope with little Dud's success |author=Peter Lewis |newspaper=[[Mail Online]] |date=10 October 2013 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-2452222/Why-Pete-just-wasnt-big-cope-little-Duds-success-ONE-LEG-TOO-FEW-THE-ADVENTURES-OF-PETER-COOK-AND-DUDLEY-MOORE-BY-WILLIAM-COOK.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comic and personal relationship between Cook and Moore is the subject of the play ''[[Pete and Dud: Come Again]]'', by Chris Bartlett and [[Nick Awde]]. In 2010, a group of comedians, [[Hugh Dennis]], [[Angus Deayton]] and [[Alistair McGowan]] among them, recreated some of the Pete and Dud comic routines on [[BBC Two]] in ''Pete and Dud: the Lost Sketches''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pete and Dud: the Lost Sketches, BBC Two, review |author=Andrew Pettie |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=9 July 2010 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/7882444/Pete-and-Dud-the-Lost-Sketches-BBC-Two-review.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Poverty of the stimulus''' ('''POS''') is the argument from [[linguistics]] that children are not exposed to rich enough data within their linguistic environments to acquire every feature of their language. This is considered evidence contrary to the [[Empiricism|empiricist]] idea that language is learned solely through experience. The claim is that the sentences children hear while learning a language do not contain the information needed to home&lt;!-- do note revert to the former "hone in", which amounts to a confounding between 2 effective  types of repetitive methods of [[iterative approximation]]:  1. [[homing in]], the making of progressively smaller changes in direction, as greater proximity improves the accuracy of estimates of the ideal direction, and 2. [[honing down]] (or away), the removal of progressively smaller amounts of material, as approaching the desired shape and size forces progressively more precise grinding, cutting, or otherwise reshaping --&gt; in on the grammar of the language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky, N.]] (1980) On Cognitive Structures and their Development: A reply to Piaget. In M. Piattelli-Palmarini, ed. Language and Learning: The debate between Jean Piaget and Noam Chomsky. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The POS is often used as evidence for [[universal grammar]]. This is the idea that all languages conform to the same structural principles, which define the space of possible languages.

Both poverty of the stimulus and universal grammar are terms that can be credited to [[Noam Chomsky]]. Chomsky coined the term "poverty of the stimulus" in 1980, however he had argued for the idea since his [[Verbal Behavior#Chomsky's review|1959 review of B.F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior]]. The POS is also related to [[Nelson Goodman]]'s [[new riddle of induction]].

==The form of the argument==
An argument from the poverty of the stimulus generally takes the following structure:&lt;ref name="PullumScholz2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, J.A. (1966) How to learn to talk: Some simple ways. in F. Smith and G.A. Miller (eds) The Genesis of Language, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blackwell Handbook of Language Development|last=Gathercole|first=Virginia C. Mueller|last2=Hoff|first2=Erika|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 6. Input and the Acquisition of Language: Three Questions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The speech that children are exposed to is consistent with numerous possible grammars.
# It is possible to define data, D, that would distinguish the target grammar from all other grammars that are consistent with the input.
# D is missing from speech to children.
# Children nonetheless acquire the target grammar.
# Therefore, the right grammatical structure arises due to some (possibly linguistic) property of the child.

==Background and history==
Chomsky coined the term "poverty of the stimulus" in 1980. This idea is closely related to what Chomsky calls "[[Plato's Problem]]". He outlined this [[philosophical]] approach in the first chapter of the ''Knowledge of Language'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I6CZ6wpNKeEC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=plato's+problem#v=onepage&amp;q=plato's%20problem&amp;f=true|title=The Cambridge Companion to Chomsky|author=James McGilvray|date=2005-02-24|page=42|accessdate=2016-01-21|via=Books.google.com|isbn=9780521784313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's Problem traces back to ''[[Meno]]'', a [[Socratic dialogue]]. In Meno, Socrates unearths knowledge of geometry concepts from a servant who was never explicitly taught them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/rgrizzard/M316L_SP12/meno.pdf|title=Plato's ''Meno''|author1=J. Holbo|author2=B. Waring|date=2002|publisher=Idiom.ucsd.edu&lt;!--WTF?--&gt;|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024063724/http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/rgrizzard/M316L_SP12/meno.pdf|archivedate=2013-10-24|accessdate=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's Problem directly parallels the idea of the innateness of language, universal grammar, and more specifically the poverty of the stimulus argument because it reveals that people's knowledge is richer than what they are exposed to. Chomsky illustrates that humans are not exposed to all structures of their language, yet they fully achieve knowledge of these structures.

Linguistic nativism is the theory that humans are born with some knowledge of language. One acquires a language not entirely through experience. According to Noam Chomsky,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=N|title=Language and the problems of knowledge|date=1988|publisher=MIT Press|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The speed and precision of vocabulary acquisition leaves no real alternative to the conclusion that the child somehow has the concepts available before experience with language and is basically learning labels for concepts that are already a part of his or her conceptual apparatus." Chomsky's view that the humans possess an innate faculty of language is shared by [[Steven Pinker]]. One of the most significant arguments generative grammarians have for linguistic nativism is the poverty of the stimulus argument.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09515080802412321|title=Language Learning in Infancy: Does the Empirical Evidence Support a Domain Specific Language Acquisition Device?|journal=Philosophical Psychology|volume=21|issue=5|pages=641–671|year=2008|last1=Behme|first1=Christina|last2=Deacon|first2=S. Hélène}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=Language and mind.|date=1972|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|edition=Enl.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=Rules of Language|journal=Science|volume=253|issue=5019|doi=10.1126/science.1857983|pmid=1857983|pages=530–535|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pullum and Scholz frame the poverty of the stimulus argument by examining all of the ways that the input is insufficient for language acquisition.&lt;ref name="PullumScholz2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pullum |first1=Geoffrey K. |last2=Scholz |first2=Barbara C. |title=Empirical assessment of stimulus poverty arguments |journal=Linguistic Review |date=2002 |volume=19 |issue=1/2 | pages = 9–50 | url = http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~gpullum/bcscholz/Assessment.pdf  | doi = 10.1515/tlir.19.1-2.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, children are exposed only to positive evidence. They do not receive [[Negative evidence in language acquisition|explicit correction or instruction about what is not possible in the language]].&lt;ref name="PullumScholz2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Longa|first1=Víctor M|title=What about a (really) minimalist theory of language acquisition?|journal=Linguistics|date=2008|volume=46|issue=3|pages=541–570|doi=10.1515/ling.2008.018|citeseerx=10.1.1.610.5289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the input that children receive is degenerate in terms of scope and quality.&lt;ref name="Oh Jeffrey Boy"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Lasnik| first1 = Howard| first2 = Jeffrey L.| last2 = Lidz| contribution = The Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus| editor-last = Roberts| editor-first = Ian| title = The Oxford Handbook of Universal Grammar| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2016| contribution-url = http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573776.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199573776-e-10| doi = 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573776.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199573776-e-10| doi-broken-date = 2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Degeneracy of scope means that the input does not contain information about the full extent of any grammatical rules. Degeneracy of quality means that children are exposed to speech errors, utterances by nonnative speakers, and false starts, potentially obscuring the grammatical structure of the language. Furthermore, the linguistic data each child is exposed to is different and so the basis for learning is idiosyncratic. However, despite these insufficiencies, children eventually acquire the grammar of the language they are exposed to.  Further, other organisms in the same environment do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=Poverty of Stimulus: Unfinished Business|journal=Studies in Chinese Linguistics|date=2012|volume=33|issue=1|pages=3–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the nativists' point of view, the insufficiency of the input leads to the conclusion that humans are hard-wired with a UG and thus support the [[innateness hypothesis]].

However, the argument that the poverty of stimulus supports the innateness hypothesis remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laurence|first1=Stephen|title=The Poverty of the Stimulus Argument|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|date=2001|volume=52|issue=2|pages=217–276|doi=10.1093/bjps/52.2.217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Fiona Cowie claims that the Poverty of Stimulus argument fails "on both empirical and conceptual grounds to support nativism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cowie|first1=Fiona|title=What's Within? Nativism Reconsidered|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
An overarching theme in examples provided as evidence for the poverty of the stimulus is that children acquire grammatical rules based on evidence that is consistent with multiple generalizations. And since children are not instructed in the grammar of their language, the gap must be filled in by properties of the learner.

===Syntax===
====Binding theory – Principle C====
# While he was dancing, the Ninja Turtle ate pizza.
# He ate pizza while the Ninja Turtle was dancing.
In general, pronouns can refer to any prominent individual in the discourse context. However, a pronoun cannot find its antecedent in certain structural positions, as defined by the [[Binding (linguistics)|Binding Theory]]. For example, the pronoun "he" can refer to the Ninja Turtle in (1) but not (2), above. Given that speech to children does not indicate what interpretations are impossible, the input is equally consistent with a grammar that allows coreference between "he" and "the Ninja Turtle" in (2) and one that does not. But, since all speakers of English recognize that (2) does not allow this coreference, this aspect of the grammar must come from some property internal to the learner.&lt;ref name="Oh Jeffrey Boy" /&gt;

====Passives====
# I believe the dog to be hungry
# The dog is believed to be hungry
# I believe the dog's owner to be hungry.
# The dog's owner is believed to be hungry.
# * The dog is believed's owner to be hungry.
The sentences in (1) and (2) illustrate the [[English passive voice|active-passive alternation in English]]. The Noun Phrase after the verb in the active (1) is the subject in the passive (2). Data like (2) would be compatible with a passive rule stated in terms of linear order (move the 1st NP after the verb) or syntactic structure (move the highest NP after the verb). The data in (3-5) illustrate that the actual rule is formulated in terms of structure. If it were stated in terms of linear order, then (4) would be ungrammatical and (5) would be grammatical. But the opposite is true. However, children may not be exposed to sentences like (3-5) as evidence in favor of the correct grammar. Thus, the fact that all adult speakers agree that (4) is grammatical and (5) is not suggests that the linear rule was never even considered and that children are predisposed to a structure based grammatical system.&lt;ref name="Oh Jeffrey Boy" /&gt;

====Anaphoric "one"====
The English word "one" can refer back to a previously mentioned property in the discourse. For example in (1), "one" can mean "ball". 
# I like this ball and you like that one. 
# I like this red ball and you like that one. 
In (2), one is interpreted as "red ball." However, even if a speaker intends (2) in this way, it would be difficult to distinguish that interpretation from one in which "one" simply meant "ball". This is because when a speaker refers to a red ball, they are also referring to a ball since the set of red balls is a subset of balls in general. 18-month-olds, like adults, show that they believe 'one' refers to 'red ball' and not 'ball'.&lt;ref name="Infants"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lidz|first1=J.|last2=Freedman|first2=J.|last3=Waxman|first3=S.|date=October 2003|title=What infants know about syntax but couldn't have learned: experimental evidence for syntactic structure at 18 months|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027703001161?via%3Dihub|journal=Cognition|volume=89|pages=295–303|number=3|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(03)00116-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence available to children is systematically ambiguous between a grammar in which "one" refers back to Nouns and one in which "one" refers back to noun phrases. Despite this ambiguity, children learn the more narrow interpretation, suggesting that some property other than the input is responsible for their interpretations.

====Island effects====
In Wh-questions, the Wh-word at the beginning of the sentence (the filler) is related to a position later in the sentence (the gap). This relation can hold over an unbounded distance, as in (1). However, there are restrictions on the gap positions that a filler can be related to. These restrictions are called [[Wh-movement#Extraction islands|syntactic islands]] (2). Because questions with islands are ungrammatical, they are not included in the speech that children hear—but neither are grammatical Wh-questions that span multiple clauses. Because the speech children are exposed to is consistent with grammars which have island constraints and grammars which don't, something internal to the child must contribute this knowledge.
#What did you claim that Jack bought _ ?
#&lt;nowiki&gt;*What did you make the claim that Jack bought _ ? (Complex Noun Phrase Island)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=== Phonology ===
==== Learning stress systems ====
Bergelson &amp; Idsardi (2009) presented adults with words drawn from an artificial language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Bergelson E|author2=Idsardi WJ|date=2009|title=Structural biases in phonology: infant and adult evidence from artificial language learning.|url=http://174.143.211.73/~idsardi/papers/2009bucld.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd BUCLD|volume=33|pages=85–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words contained 3 CV syllables. If the last vowel was long, then it bore [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. Otherwise, stress fell on the first syllable. This pattern is consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, a long vowel bears stress if it is the last segment in the word. This is a rule based on absolute finality. In the other grammar, a long vowel bears stress only if it is the last vowel in the word (i.e., even if it is not the last segment of the word). This is a rule based on relative finality. In natural languages stress rules make reference to relative finality but not to absolute finality. After being exposed to these words, participants were then tested to see whether they thought that a word with a long vowel in a closed syllable (CVVC) would bear stress. If it did, then that would be consistent with the relative-final grammar, but not with the absolute-final grammar. English-speaking adults (tested through computer software) were more likely to accept the words from the relative-final grammar than from the absolute-final grammar. Since the data they were exposed to was equally consistent with both grammars, and since neither rule is a rule of English, the source of this decision must have come from the participants, not from any aspect of their experience. In addition, eighth-month-old children (tested via the [[Statistical language acquisition#Headturn Preference Procedure|Headturn Preference Procedure]]) were found to have the same preference as adults. Given that this preference could not have come from their exposure to either the artificial language or to their native language, the researchers concluded that human language acquisition mechanisms are "hardwired" to lead infants towards certain generalizations, consistent with the argument for the poverty of the stimulus.

==== English plural marker ====

Halle (1978)&lt;ref name="Halle" /&gt; argues that the morphophonological rule governing the [[English plurals|English plural]] produces forms that are consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows one of the sounds [p, t, k, f, 𝝷]; otherwise it is pronounced as [z]. In the other grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows a voiceless consonant. These rules are exactly equal in their coverage of English since the set of consonants that triggers the [s] pronunciation is identical in the two cases. However, Halle also observes that English speakers consistently pluralize the German name ''Bach'' (pronounced ''/bax/'') as ''/baxs/'', despite not having any experience with the ''/x/'' sound, which is nonexistent in English. Since there is "no indication" that speakers could have acquired this knowledge, Halle argues that the tendency to build rules in terms of natural classes comes from a factor internal to the child and not from their experience.&lt;ref name="Halle"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262580434_sch_0009.pdf|title=From Memory to Speech and Back: Papers on Phonetics and Phonology|last=Halle|first=Morris|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=294–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semantics ===

==== Word learning ====

The poverty of the stimulus also applies in the domain of word learning. When learning a new word, children are exposed to examples of the word's referent, but not to the full extent of the category. For example, in learning the word "dog", a child might see a German Shepherd, a Great Dane and a Poodle. How do they know to extend this category to include Dachshunds and Bulldogs? The situations in which the word is used cannot provide the relevant information. Thus, something internal to learners must shape the way that they generalize. This problem is closely related to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s [[Indeterminacy of translation|gavagai]] problem.

==== Attitude verbs ====
In other cases, words refer to aspects of the world that cannot be observed directly. For example [[Lila R. Gleitman|Lila Gleitman]] poses a POS argument with respect to verbs that label mental states. She observes that a learner cannot see inside another person's mind, and so an utterance of "Kim thinks that it is raining" is likely to occur in the same kinds of contexts as "Kim wonders if it is raining" or even "Kim wants it to rain". If no aspect of the context can determine whether a mental state verb refers to thinkings, wanting or wonderings, then some aspect of children's minds must direct their attention to other cues. Thus, our ability to learn these word meanings must be shaped by factors internal to the child and not simply from the conditions of their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila R.|last2=Cassidy|first2=Kimberly|last3=Nappa|first3=Rebecca|last4=Papafragou|first4=Anna|last5=Trueswell|first5=John C.|date=2005-01-01|title=Hard Words|journal=Language Learning and Development|volume=1|issue=1|pages=23–64|doi=10.1207/s15473341lld0101_4|issn=1547-5441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative viewpoints==
Some researchers argue that the poverty of the stimulus argument, which supports nativist theorizing, does not disprove the hypothesis that language is learned entirely from external sources.&lt;ref name="PullumScholz2002"/&gt;{{rp|10–50}} Some argue that nativist views reflect a failure to imagine how the input could support specific grammatical conclusions in the absence of innate structure.&lt;ref name="Gahl"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gahl, Regier|first1=Susanne, Terry|date=2003|title=Learning the Unlearnable: the role of missing evidence|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027704000587|journal=Cognition|volume=93|issue=2|pages=147–155|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2003.12.003|pmid=15147936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas of criticism range from discussions about whether the poverty of the stimulus can be solved not through innate linguistic knowledge, but from other capacities like social cognition or statistical learning.

The empiricist views suggest that language can be learned with mental processes originally meant for other modes of cognition, and that there need not be a concept of innateness in order to account for the difference between the input a child receives versus the language they develop. Natural languages display statistical cues that children are able to learn from. Some argue that the ability to learn by [[Statistical learning in language acquisition|statistical pattern matching]] can solve problems that nativists argue require innate knowledge.

Some researchers also argue that the POS problem can be overcome through [[Negative evidence in language acquisition#Implicit direct negative evidence|implicit negative evidence]] or [[Negative evidence in language acquisition#Indirect negative evidence in language acquisition|indirect negative evidence]].

'''Psychology’s Feminist Voices''' (PFV) is an [[online]], [[multimedia]] [[digital archive]] containing the stories of women of psychology’s past and contemporary feminist psychologists who have shaped and continue to transform the discipline of [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacArthur|first1=H.J.|last2=Shields|first2=S.A.|title=Psychology’s Feminist Voices: A critical pedagogical tool|journal=Sex Roles|date=2014|volume=70|pages=431–433|doi=10.1007/s11199-014-0349-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It houses a wide range of materials, including  original biographical profiles, [[oral history]] interview [[transcript (law)|transcript]]s, video content, [[timelines]], [[bibliographies]], teaching resources, and an original 40-minute documentary on the emergence and current status of [[feminist psychology]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=liebert&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liebert|first1=R.|title=The Changing Face of Feminist Psychology|journal=Signs: Films for the Feminist Classroom|date=Fall 2009|issue=1.2|url=http://www.signs.rutgers.edu/rev_rl_film_1-2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is continually expanding and currently has a database containing the profiles of over 250  psychologists from around the world.

PFV is also an online teaching resource, with sample [[syllabi]] for teaching [[history of psychology]] from a [[feminist]] perspective,  teaching guides for incorporating PFV material into history and psychology of gender courses, assignments, handouts, and teaching videos.&lt;ref name=ball&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ball|first1=L.C.|last2=Bazar|first2=J.|last3=Mackay|first3=J.|last4=Rodkey|first4=E.|last5=Rutherford|first5=A.|last6=Young|first6=J.L.|title=Using Psychology’s Feminist Voices in the classroom, Psychology of Women Quarterly|journal=Psychology of  Women Quarterly|date=2013|volume=37|pages=261–266|doi=10.1177/0361684313480484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leong|first1=Frederick T.L.

PFV is a free resource and all interview transcripts are downloadable as [[Portable Document Format|.pdf]] files; all video content is available at the site and at the psychsfeministvoices YouTube channel;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology's Feminist Voices YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/psychsfeministvoices}}&lt;/ref&gt;  all interview transcripts are [[copyrighted]] to Feminist Voices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology's Feminist Voices Copyright Rules|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/copyright/}}&lt;/ref&gt; except where indicated.

== History ==

The Psychology’s Feminist Voices project was founded by Alexandra Rutherford in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexandra Rutherford|url=http://health.info.yorku.ca/health-profiles/index.php?mid=78979}}&lt;/ref&gt; It  began as a collection of [[oral histories]] with contemporary feminist psychologists, many of whom  established the field of [[feminist psychology]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] in the early 1970s. It quickly expanded, however, to encompass a larger goal: the documentation of women throughout psychology’s history, as well as a large and diverse sample of feminist psychologists in order to create a comprehensive picture of the impact of [[gender]], women’s participation, and [[feminism]], on the development of [[psychology]] as a science and profession.&lt;ref name=macarthur&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacArthur|first1=H.J.|last2=Shields|first2=S.A&gt;|title=Psychology’s Feminist Voices: A critical pedagogical tool|journal=Sex Roles|date=2013|volume=70|issue=431-433|doi=10.1007/s11199-014-0349-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Radtke|first1=H.L.|title=Canadian perspectives on feminism and psychology|date=2011|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media|location=New York, NY|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/905214823|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The online resource, www.feministvoices.com, was launched in 2010 and now has a corresponding [[Facebook]] site, [[YouTube]] channel, and [[Twitter]] feed.&lt;br /&gt;
 
This project is based at [[York University]], [[Toronto]], Canada. It has received funding from the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]], and has been endorsed by the Society for the Psychology of Women, Division 35 of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA), the Society for the History of Psychology, Division 26 of the APA, the Section on Women and Psychology of the Canadian Psychological Association, and the [[Association for Women in Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology's Feminist Voices|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/about|website=PFV: About Us|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

The Psychology’s Feminist Voices [[digital archive]] has two main sections: 
Women Past (1848-1950)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Past|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/past|website=Women Past|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Feminist Presence(1950-).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feminist Presence|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/presence|website=Feminist Presence|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Women Past section contains [[Demographic profile|profiles]] of women who received their [[doctoral degrees]] in psychology before 1950. The Feminist Presence section features profiles of and interviews with self-identified feminist psychologists who received their doctorates after 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology's Feminist Voieces|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/|website=Feminist Voices|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sections contain the following subsections:

'''Profiles:''' Each psychologist  has a profile page containing their training, affiliations, biographies, media links, photographs, and a list of selected works. The Feminist Presence profiles also usually include transcripts and video clips of interviews conducted by the PFV team.&lt;br /&gt;
 
'''Timeline:'''  Provides a [[chronology]] of major events in feminist history and psychology, beginning with the 1848 [[Seneca Falls Convention]] up to recent breakthroughs such as the publication of the report on the trafficking of women and girls by The Society for the Psychology of Women Special Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on the trafficking of women and girls|url=http://www.apadivisions.org/division-35/leadership/task-forces/trafficking/women-girls-report.aspx|website=Division 35|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Resources:''' Includes bibliographies, teaching materials, websites, and archives with relevant collections. All of these resources are meant to serve as starting points for teaching and research on the history of women in psychology and science, as well as the history of feminism. An original teaching video series, "Feminist Psychologists Talk About..." is also featured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feminist Psychologists Talk About|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/psychology-s-feminist-voices-teaching-resources/ “Feminist Psychologists Talk About…”|website=Teaching Videos|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first video in the series is on women’s mental health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Mental Health Video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czc2_uidOm8|website=Women's Mental Health video|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[feminist therapy]].

'''Search Page:''' The content of the site is searchable by keyword, name, birth and death dates, training location, and affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clink|first1=Kellian|title=Psychology's Feminist Voices|journal=Reference Reviews|date=December 2014|volume=29|issue=3|pages=16–17|doi=10.1108/RR-12-2014-0337}}&lt;/ref&gt; This page also includes a rotating banner of “Featured Psychologists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Search Page|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/search|website=Search Page|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Additional Content ===

'''Video Resources:''' The Changing Face of Feminist Psychology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Resource|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14Ezm5XfaXA|website=The Changing Face of Feminist Psychology|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an original [[documentary]] that uses archival material and interviews to explore the context in which feminist psychology emerged and how it has shaped the field of psychology.&lt;ref name=liebert /&gt; Original interview clips from individual psychologists can also be found on PFV’s YouTube channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Original interview clips|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/psychsfeministvoices/|website=Feminist Voices YouTube Channel|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''RMN Newsletter''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] and [[open access]] [[academic journal]] published on a bi-annual basis by the [[University of Helsinki]]’s Department of Folklore Studies.&lt;ref name="RMN-ABOUT"&gt;"About". ''RMN Newsletter''. University of Helsinki website. Online: [https://www.helsinki.fi/en/networks/retrospective-methods-network/about-rmn-newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt; Published in both digital and print editions, ''RMN Newsletter'' covers topics relevant to [[folkloristics]], [[linguistics]], [[history]], [[archaeology]], and [[philology]], especially in the areas of [[Germanic philology|Germanic studies]], [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric studies]], and [[Baltic studies]]. The publication places particular emphasis on what the journal refers to as "retrospective methods", a [[research method]] that compares material recorded in differing periods.&lt;ref name="HEIDE-WHY"&gt;See for example Heide, Eldar. 2010. "Why a Network for Retrospective Methods?". ''RMN Newsletter'', 1, pp. 6-7. University of Helsinki.

Residuals are calculated and administered by [[Film industry|industry]] [[trade union]]s like [[SAG-AFTRA]], the [[Directors Guild of America]], and the [[Writers Guild of America]].&lt;ref name="grimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1 =Grimes |first1 =Gerlinda |title= Can a TV actor live off royalties forever?|url= https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/can-tv-actor-live-off-royalties-forever.htm | website =HowStuffWorks|accessdate=3 February 2018|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is typically used in the plural form.

==History==

Technological advances gave rise to residual payments, and their evolution can be traced in terms of those technologies.

===Radio===
Residuals were established in [[Radio in the United States|U.S. network radio]]. [[Live radio]] programs with nationwide audiences were generally performed either two or three times to account for different [[time zone]]s between the east and west coasts of the United States. The performers were paid for each performance. After audio "[[transcription disc]]" technology became widely available in the late 1930s, it was initially used to make recordings to send to radio stations that were not connected to the live network. As sound quality improved, radio networks began using them for time-delaying west coast broadcasts, eventually eliminating the need for multiple performances. The performers were kept on standby and paid for a second performance in case there were technical problems. This established the precedent for residual payments from recorded performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Television===
In the early 1950s, a similar transition occurred in television. Initially, most television broadcasts were either live performances or broadcasts of older films originally produced for theaters. [[Kinescope]] recordings were made of live east coast performances so they could be broadcast several hours later on the west coast, which also made it possible to broadcast these shows later as many times as they wanted. In 1952, residual payments were extended to these television [[rerun]]s, thanks in large part to [[Ronald Reagan]], whose first term as president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) ran from 1947 to 1952.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verrier|first1=Richard|title=Residual resentment slows Hollywood talks|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-fi-residuals16oct16-story.html|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|date=16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, the [[Writers Guild of America|WGA]] negotiated residuals for up to five reruns for made-for-TV shows.&lt;ref name = "survival"/&gt;

That said, film actors were still not paid residuals for reruns. As Americans increasingly watched TV at home instead of going out to the movies, movie attendance plummeted by over 65% between 1948 and 1959, [[film studio|studios]] were grappling with decreased revenues, and actors felt like they were being deprived of significant income that was owed to them. The studios, however, took a hardline stance on residuals for movie actors due to their shrinking revenue as well as the fact that if they paid residuals to actors, they would also have to pay directors and [[screenwriter]]s as well.&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Federman|first1=Wayne|title=What Reagan Did for Hollywood|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/11/what-reagan-did-for-hollywood/248391/|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=The Atlantic|date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This stalemate led SAG actors to re-elect [[Ronald Reagan]] as SAG President in fall of 1959. Reagan asked SAG for a [[Strike action|strike]] authorization in February and the actors agreed on a work-stop date for March 7, 1960, Hollywood's first-ever industry-wide strike. Starting with [[Universal Pictures]], studios ended up agreeing to film residuals, but only for movies made after 1960s. They would issue a one-time payout of $2.25 million for movies made between 1948 and 1960, and movies made before 1948 would not be eligible for any residuals. (Unrelated to residuals, Reagan also secured [[health insurance]] and [[pension]]s for SAG actors.) This upset older actors like [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Glenn Ford]] and [[Bob Hope]], who blamed Reagan and the SAG board for weak negotiating, but in April 1960 SAG voted to accept the offer and returned to work.&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt;

In 1988, WGA launched [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|its longest strike]], lasting 22 weeks, over a disagreement over residuals for TV shows broadcast in foreign countries. The new contract allowed writers two formulas for calculating foreign residuals: the existing formula ($4,400 maximum for a one-hour show) or the new formula (1.2% of the producer's foreign sales). On the other hand, domestic residuals were adjusted to take a sliding scale, which would incentivize producers to [[Broadcast syndication|syndicate]] one-hour shows, whose revenue performance was poor, to independent TV stations.&lt;ref name="nyt1988"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harmetz|first1=Aljean|title=Writers Ratify Contract, Ending Longest Strike|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/08/movies/writers-ratify-contract-ending-longest-strike.html|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=New York Times|date=8 August 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New media===

In 2007, the [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers]] (AMPTP), the industry bargaining group that deals with the trade unions, called for an end to the current residual payment system in response to the rise of online media. Instead, it proposed that residuals be pooled so the studios would recoup their costs paying the actors, directors, and writers based on a profit-based formula,&lt;ref name="ciep"&gt;{{cite news| last1 = Cieply | first1 =Michael | title =Hollywood Officials Seek End to System Of Paying Residuals| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/12/business/media/12hollywood-web.html |accessdate=3 February 2018|work=New York Times|date=12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would solve the problem that residuals remain the same despite decreases in TV profits.&lt;ref name="handel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Handel|first1=Jonathan|title=Residuals Revelation: Network Primetime Residuals as Chilly for SAG/AFTRA and DGA as WGA|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/residuals-revelation-network-primetime-residuals-214646|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers in the [[Writers Guild of America]] (WGA) decided to negotiate for higher residual payments. The AMPTP adamantly opposed extending residuals to online movie and TV show sales for at least three years, citing the need to "adapt to the realities of the marketplace, the new demands from our audiences and new technologies",&lt;ref name = "latimes"/&gt; while a WGA representative countered that they "already had effective business models".&lt;ref name = "ciep"/&gt;

In 2011, SAG-AFTRA, WGA, and DGA negotiations kept residuals for network primetime TV (considered "among the most lucrative" residuals) frozen at previous levels.&lt;ref name = "handel"/&gt;

== Process ==

Residuals are administered by the [[labor union|unions]]—[[SAG-AFTRA]], the [[Directors Guild of America]] (DGA), and the [[Writers Guild of America]] (WGA)—for their members, who are paid between one and four months after the air date. According to [[SAG-AFTRA]], it processes around 1.5 million residual checks a year.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; WGA receives between 100 and 5,000 residual checks a day.&lt;ref name = "survival"/&gt; The DGA processes "hundreds of thousands of checks" a year, and in 2016 it processed $300 million in residuals for its members.&lt;ref name="dga"&gt;{{cite web|title= Residuals |url=https://www.dga.org/The-Guild/Departments/Residuals.aspx|website=Directors Guild of America |accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residual calculation is complex and depends on several variables, including guild membership, initial payment, time spent, type of production (e.g., network TV, DVD, ad-supported streaming, online purchases), and whether it involves a domestic or foreign market. Additionally, residuals change a lot: guilds negotiate new contracts with the [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers|AMPTP]] every three years, and residuals for primetime TV tend to increase every year because they are "directly or indirectly keyed to salary minimums, which increase several percent per year".&lt;ref name = "handel"/&gt;

In acting, [[Extra (acting)|extras]] are generally not eligible, but [[stunt performer]]s, [[puppeteer]]s, singers, and actors with lines or scripted physical interactions with characters ("supporting actors" or "day players") are eligible.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web|title=Residuals FAQ|url=https://www.sagaftra.org/content/residuals-faq|website=SAG-AFTRA|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Principal performers generally get larger residuals.&lt;ref name="market"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Andres |first1= Tommy| title=How do actors make money off residuals?|url=https://www.marketplace.org/2014/10/24/business/ive-always-wondered/how-do-actors-make-money-residuals|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=Marketplace|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the more prominent the actor, the more generous the residual. Big stars like [[Tom Cruise]], for example, would get a portion of DVD sales in addition to his "regular" residuals.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Handel|first1=Jonathan|title=Hollywood on Strike!: An Industry at War in the Internet Age|date=2011|publisher=Hollywood Analytics|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781438233857|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZvLwaBN1uAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All "credited" writers are eligible for residuals, and the specific credit determines the amount of amount. For example, the "written by" credit yields a 100% residual allocation, "screenplay/teleplay by" yields a 75%, and "adaptation by" yields 10%.&lt;ref name="survival"&gt;{{cite book|title=Residual Survivals Guide|date=October 2016|publisher=Writers Guild of America|url=http://www.wga.org/uploadedfiles/members/finances/residualssurvival2016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Not super relevant?
Disabled members are not supposed to have [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA]] ([[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]) removed from their residuals. Some studios do comply if the disabled member contacts the movie studio, but there are other studios that choose to violate the IRS rule.
--&gt;
=== Examples ===
Residual payments can sometimes be very small if the role was small or the movie or show was not successful. For example, actor [[Jeff Cohen (actor)|Jeff Cohen]] received a residual check for $0.67 after appearing in one episode of ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]''; he took it to a former bar in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]] called "Maeve's Re$iduals", which used to trade free drinks for any [[SAG-AFTRA]] residual checks for less than $1.&lt;ref name="bkstg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Jeff|title=Calculating SAG Residuals| url= https://www.backstage.com/news/calculating-sag-residuals/|accessdate=3 February 2018 |work=Backstage|date=14 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[Bob Gunton]], who played Warden Norton in ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'', noted that the movie, one of the most-rerun films, generated "close to six figures" in residuals for him in 2004, ten years after the movie was released, and even as of 2014, that he continued to receive "a very substantial income".&lt;ref name="bi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weisman|first1=Aly|title=The Actors From 'Shawshank Redemption' Still Make A 'Steady' Income Off TV Residual Checks|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/actors-from-shawshank-redemption-residual-pay-2014-6|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=Business Insider|date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, actor [[Lisa Kudrow]] of ''[[Friends]]'' was ordered to pay $1.6 million to her former manager, who argued that he was owed 5% of Kudrow's residuals earnings from work that he negotiated.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rothman|first1=Michael|title='Friends' Star Lisa Kudrow Loses $1.6 Million Lawsuit|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/friends-star-lisa-kudrow-loses-16-million-lawsuit/story?id=22681593|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=ABC News|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Friends star Lisa Kudrow must pay ex-manager $1.6m|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26381575|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=BBC|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using figures that were publicly disclosed, one analyst estimated Kudrow's residuals to be at least $2.3 million, and likely much higher.&lt;ref name="market"/&gt;

{{Politics}}

The '''rule of law''' is "The authority and influence of [[law]] in society, especially when viewed as a constraint on individual and institutional behavior; (hence) the principle whereby all members of a society (including those in government) are considered equally subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes".&lt;ref name=OED&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' online (accessed September 13, 2018;  spelling Americanized).  The phrase "the rule of law" is also sometimes used in other senses.  ''See'' Garner, Bryan A. (Editor in Chief). ''Black's Law Dictionary'', 9th Edition, p. 1448. (Thomson Reuters, 2009). {{ISBN|978-0-314-26578-4}}.  Black's provides a five definitions of "rule of law":  the lead definition is "A substantive legal principle";  the second is the "supremacy of regular as opposed to arbitrary power".&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase "the rule of law" refers to a political situation, not to any specific legal rule.  

Use of the phrase can be traced back to 16th-century [[Great Britain|Britain]], and in the following century the Scottish theologian [[Samuel Rutherford]] employed it in arguing against the [[divine right of kings]].&lt;ref name="Rex" /&gt;  [[John Locke]] wrote that freedom in society means being subject only to laws made by a legislature that apply to everyone, with a person being otherwise free from both governmental and private restrictions upon liberty.  "The rule of law" was further popularized in the 19th century by British jurist [[A. V. Dicey]]. However, the principle, if not the phrase itself, was recognized by ancient thinkers;  for example, [[Aristotle]] wrote: "It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens".&lt;ref name="ari" /&gt;

The rule of law implies that every person is subject to the law, including people who are lawmakers, law enforcement officials, and judges.&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, Charles.  ''The Great Chief Justice: John Marshall and the Rule of Law'', p. 57 (University Press of Kansas, 1996): according to [[John Marshall]], "the framers of the Constitution contemplated that instrument as a rule for the government of courts, as well as of the legislature."&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it stands in contrast to a [[monarchy]] or [[oligarchy]] where the rulers are held above the law. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Lack of the rule of law can be found in both democracies and monarchies, for example, because of neglect or ignorance of the law, and the rule of law is more apt to decay if a government has insufficient corrective mechanisms for restoring it.

==History==
Although credit for popularizing the expression "the rule of law" in modern times is usually given to [[A. V. Dicey]],&lt;ref name=Wormuth /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Bingham|Bingham, Thomas]]. ''The Rule of Law'', p. 3 (Penguin 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; development of the legal concept can be traced through history to many ancient civilizations, including [[ancient Greece]], [[History of China#Ancient China|China]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[India]], and [[ancient Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, Anthony. ''A World History of Ancient Political Thought'' (Oxford University Press 2009). {{ISBN|0-19-928169-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquity===
In the [[Western civilization|West]], the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] initially regarded the best form of government as rule by the best men.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;  [[Plato]] advocated a [[benevolent dictatorship|benevolent monarchy]] ruled by an idealized [[philosopher king]], who was above the law.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;David Clarke, "[http://www.lfip.org/lawe506/documents/lawe506davidclarke.pdf The many meanings of the rule of law]" in Kanishka Jayasuriya, ed., ''Law, Capitalism and Power in Asia'' (New York: Routledge, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Plato nevertheless hoped that the best men would be good at respecting established laws, explaining that "Where the law is subject to some other authority and has none of its own, the collapse of the state, in my view, is not far off; but if law is the master of the government and the government is its slave, then the situation is full of promise and men enjoy all the blessings that the gods shower on a state."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, John et al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=eSKTvJDrr5kC&amp;pg=PA1402&amp;lpg=PA1402&amp;dq=%22if+law+is+the+master+of+the+government+and+the+government+is+its+slave%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XNhu-PDe7H&amp;sig=4in2cTSQVL-2gcq9i881VqWYUxo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UmTZSZDIKqntlQe4vLzgDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#PPA1402,M1 Complete Works By Plato]'', p. 1402 (Hackett Publishing, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; More than Plato attempted to do, [[Aristotle]] flatly opposed letting the highest officials wield power beyond guarding and serving the laws.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt; In other words, Aristotle advocated the rule of law:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens: upon the same principle, if it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some particular persons, they should be appointed to be only guardians, and the servants of the laws.&lt;ref name=ari&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' [[s:Politics (Ellis)/Book 3#3:16|3.16]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Roman statesman [[Cicero]] is often cited as saying, roughly:   "We are all servants of the laws in order to be free."&lt;ref&gt;In full: "The magistrates who administer the law, the judges who act as its spokesmen, all the rest of us who live as its servants, grant it our allegiance as a guarantee of our freedom."{{mdash}}{{cite book|author=Cicero|title=Murder Trials|translator=Michael Grant|location=Harmondsworth|publisher=Penguin|year=1975|series=Penguin Classics|page=217}}  
Original Latin:  "Legum ministri magistratus, legum interpretes iudices, legum denique idcirco omnes servi sumus ut liberi esse possimus."{{mdash}}{{cite web|url=

Under the Roman Empire, the sovereign was personally immune (''legibus solutus''), but those with grievances could sue the treasury.&lt;ref name=Wormuth&gt;Wormuth, Francis. ''The Origins of Modern Constitutionalism'', p. 28 (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, members of the school of [[w:Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]] during the 3rd century BC argued for using law as a tool of governance, but they promoted "rule ''by'' law" as opposed to "rule ''of'' law", meaning that they placed the aristocrats and emperor above the law.&lt;ref&gt;Xiangming, Zhang. [http://www.international-relations.com/wbcm5-1/wbrule.htm On Two Ancient Chinese Administrative Ideas: Rule of Virtue and Rule by Law], ''The Culture Mandala: Bulletin of the Centre for East-West Cultural and Economic Studies'' (2002): “Although Han Fei recommended that the government should rule by law, which seems impartial, he advocated that the law be enacted by the lords solely. The lords place themselves above the law. The law is thereby a monarchical means to control the people, not the people's means to restrain the lords. The lords are by no means on an equal footing with the people. Hence we cannot mention the rule by law proposed by Han Fei in the same breath as democracy and the rule of law advocated today.”&lt;br /&gt;Bevir, Mark.

There has recently been an effort to reevaluate the influence of the Bible on Western constitutional law. In the [[Old Testament]], the book of [[Deuteronomy]] imposes certain restrictions on the king, regarding such matters as the numbers of wives he might take and of horses he might acquire (for his own use).

===Middle Ages===
In [[Sharia|Islamic jurisprudence]] rule of law was formulated in the seventh century, so that no official could claim to be above the law, not even the [[caliph]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Weeramantry|Weeramantry, Christopher]] (1997). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3-1sH1wc58UC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22Justice+Without+Frontiers:+Furthering+Human+Rights%22&amp;ei=f1f-SbCnH5nCyASU38TvBw#PPA132,M1 Justice without Frontiers]'', p. 132 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not a reference to [[secular]] law, but to Islamic [[religious law]] in the form of [[Sharia law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Impossible State: Islam, Politics and Modernity's Moral Predicament|last=Hallaq|first=Wael|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred the Great]], Anglo-Saxon king in the 9th century, reformed the law of his kingdom and assembled a law code (the [[Doom Book]]) which he grounded on biblical commandments. He held that the same law had to be applied to all persons, whether rich or poor, friends or enemies. This was likely inspired by [[Leviticus]] 19:15: "You shall do no iniquity in judgment. You shall not favor the wretched and you shall not defer to the rich. In righteousness you are to judge your fellow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alter|first1=Robert|title=The Five Books of Moses: A Translation with Commentary|date=2004|publisher=W. W.

In 1215, Archbishop [[Stephen Langton]] gathered the Barons in England and forced [[John of England|King John]] and future sovereigns and magistrates back under the rule of law, preserving ancient liberties by [[Magna Carta]] in return for exacting taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/treasures/magnacarta/translation/mc_trans.html Magna Carta (1215) translation, British Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/ Magna Carta (1297) U.S. National Archives].&lt;/ref&gt; This foundation for a constitution was carried into the [[United States Constitution]].

In 1481, during the reign of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], the ''[[Constitució de l'Observança]]'' was approved by the [[Catalan Courts|General Court of Catalonia]], establishing the submission of royal power (included its officers) to the laws of the [[Principality of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferro, Víctor: El Dret Públic Català.

The first known use of this English phrase occurred around AD 1500.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' (OED), "[http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry:showfullentry/true?redirectedFrom=%22Rule+of+Law%22&amp;t:ac=Entry/277614 Rule of Law, n.]", accessed April 27, 2013.  According to the OED, this sentence from about 1500  was written by [[John Blount (died 1531)|John Blount]]: "Lawes And constitutcions be ordeyned be cause the noysome Appetit of man maye be kepte vnder the Rewle of lawe by the wiche mankinde ys dewly enformed to lyue honestly."  And this sentence from 1559  is attributed to [[William Bavand]]: "A Magistrate should..kepe rekenyng of all mennes behauiours, and to be carefull, least thei despisyng the rule of lawe, growe to a wilfulnes."&lt;/ref&gt;  Another early example of the phrase "rule of law" is found in a petition to [[James I of England]] in 1610, from the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Amongst many other points of happiness and freedom which your majesty's subjects of this kingdom have enjoyed under your royal progenitors, kings and queens of this realm, there is none which they have accounted more dear and precious than this, to be guided and governed by the certain ''rule of the law'' which giveth both to the head and members that which of right belongeth to them, and not by any uncertain or arbitrary form of government....&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Hallam|Hallam, Henry]]. ''The Constitutional History of England'', vol. 1, p. 441 (1827).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1607, English Chief Justice [[Sir Edward Coke]] said in the ''[[Case of Prohibitions]]'' (according to his own report) "that the law was the golden met-wand and measure to try the causes of the subjects; and which protected His Majesty in safety and peace: with which the King was greatly offended, and said, that then he should be under the law, which was treason to affirm, as he said; to which I said, that Bracton saith, ''quod Rex non debet esse sub homine, sed sub Deo et lege'' (That the King ought not to be under any man but under God and the law.)."

Among the first modern authors to use the term and give the principle theoretical foundations was [[Samuel Rutherford]] in ''[[Lex, Rex]]'' (1644).&lt;ref name=Rex&gt;Rutherford, Samuel.  ''Lex, rex: the law and the prince, a dispute for the just prerogative of king and people, containing the reasons and causes of the defensive wars of the kingdom of Scotland, and of their expedition for the ayd and help of their brethren of England'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=tpIBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=%22Samuel+Rutherford%22+and+%22but+under+rule+of+law%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3jZvY_yR6F&amp;sig=0t4WLPmw2ucho0R_mDqg9EJrKA8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAmoVChMI_oLUzO6KxwIVRpUeCh3fnQj1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Samuel%20Rutherford%22%20and%20%22but%20under%20rule%20of%20law%22&amp;f=false p. 237] (1644): "The prince remaineth, even being a prince, a social creature, a man, as well as a king; one who must buy, sell, promise, contract, dispose: ergo, he is not regula regulans, but under rule of law...."&lt;/ref&gt; The title, Latin for "the law is king", subverts the traditional formulation ''rex lex'' ("the king is law").&lt;ref name=TSC-RoL-brief&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rule of Law|url=http://www.consoc.org.uk/other-content/about-us/discover-the-facts/the-rule-of-law/|publisher=The Constitution Society|accessdate=3 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006092303/http://www.consoc.org.uk/other-content/about-us/discover-the-facts/the-rule-of-law/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] wrote in ''Oceana'' (1656), drawing principally on Aristotle’s ''Politics'', that among forms of government an “Empire of Laws, and not of Men” was preferable to an “Empire of Men, and not of Laws”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/oceanaotherworks00harr|last=Harrington|first=James|title=The Oceana and other works|editor-last=Toland|editor-first=John|location=London|publisher=Millar|edition=3|year=1747|page=37 (Internet Archive: copy possessed by [[John Adams]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Locke]] also discussed this issue in his ''[[Second Treatise of Government]]'' (1690):
&lt;blockquote&gt;The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but to have only the law of nature for his rule. The liberty of man, in society, is to be under no other legislative power, but that established, by consent, in the commonwealth; nor under the dominion of any will, or restraint of any law, but what that legislative shall enact, according to the trust put in it. Freedom then is not what Sir Robert Filmer tells us, Observations, A. 55. a liberty for every one to do what he lists, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws: but freedom of men under government is, to have a standing rule to live by, common to every one of that society, and made by the legislative power erected in it; a liberty to follow my own will in all things, where the rule prescribes not; and not to be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man: as freedom of nature is, to be under no other restraint but the law of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John.  [[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise of Civil Government]], Ch. IV, sec. 22 (1690).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The principle was also discussed by [[Montesquieu]] in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748).&lt;ref name="Tamanaha3"&gt;Tamanaha, Brian. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=p4CReF67hzQC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On the Rule of Law]'', p. 47 (Cambridge University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "rule of law" appears in [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''Dictionary'' (1755).&lt;ref&gt;Peacock, Anthony Arthur, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=eENm8IKECDYC&amp;dq= Freedom and the rule of law]'', p. 24. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776, the notion that no one is above the law was popular during the founding of the United States. For example, [[Thomas Paine]] wrote in his pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' that "in America, ''the law is king''. For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law ''ought'' to be king; and there ought to be no other."&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, Jethro. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OmA8a1Q9UekC&amp;pg=PA436&amp;dq=%22so+in+free+countries+the+law+ought+to+be+king%22+and+%22rule+of+law%22&amp;ei=9lH-Sa-cEIXGzAS0hLm2Cw A Practical Companion to the Constitution]'', p. 436 (University of California Press 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1780, [[John Adams]] enshrined this principle in the [[Massachusetts Constitution]] by seeking to establish "a government of laws and not of men."&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1780)|Massachusetts Constitution]]'', Part The First, art. XXX (1780).&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of Britain, France and the United States contributed to spreading the principle of the rule of law to other countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winks|first1=Robin W.|title=World civilization: a brief history|date=1993|publisher=Collegiate Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=9780939693283|page=406|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mY7McxJl7jYC&amp;pg=PA406&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv-sKmzafMAhXBK8AKHbYhDrEQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Billias|first1=George Athan|title=American constitutionalism heard round the world, 1776–1989: a global perspective|date=2011|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814725177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ku0TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpnefZzqfMAhXC1hoKHcjFAG0Q6AEIOjAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=53–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning and categorization of interpretations ==
The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' has defined ''rule of law'' this way:&lt;ref name=OED /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The authority and influence of law in society, esp. when viewed as a constraint on individual and institutional behaviour; (hence) the principle whereby all members of a society (including those in government) are considered equally subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rule of law implies that every citizen is subject to the law. It stands in contrast to the idea that the ruler is above the law, for example by [[divine right of kings|divine right]].

Despite wide use by politicians, judges and academics, the rule of law has been described as "an exceedingly elusive notion".&lt;ref name=elusive&gt;{{cite book|last=Tamanaha|first=Brian Z.|title=On the Rule of Law|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2004|page=3|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among modern [[Legal theory#Legal theory|legal theorists]], one finds that at least two principal conceptions of the rule of law can be identified: a [[legal formalism|formalist]] or "thin" definition, and a substantive or "[[Thick concept|thick]]" definition; one occasionally encounters a third "functional" conception.&lt;ref name="Tamanaha"&gt;Tamanaha, Brian. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=312622# “The Rule of Law for Everyone?”], ''Current Legal Problems'', vol. 55, via [[SSRN]] (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  Formalist definitions of the rule of law do not make a judgment about the "justness" of law itself, but define specific procedural attributes that a legal framework must have in order to be in compliance with the rule of law. Substantive conceptions of the rule of law go beyond this and include certain substantive rights that are said to be based on, or derived from, the rule of law.&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Craig|first=Paul P.|title=Formal and Substantive Conceptions of the Rule of Law: An Analytical Framework|journal=Public Law|page=467|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most legal theorists believe that the rule of law has purely formal characteristics, meaning that the law must be publicly declared (prohibitions or exigencies), with prospective application (punishments or consequences tied to a given prohibition or exigency), and possess the characteristics of generality (usually meaning consistency and comprehensibility), equality (that is, applied equally throughout all society), and certainty (that is, certainty of application for a given situation), but there are no requirements with regard to the content of the law. Others, including a few legal theorists, believe that the rule of law necessarily entails protection of individual rights. Within legal theory, these two approaches to the rule of law are seen as the two basic alternatives, respectively labelled the formal and substantive approaches. Still, there are other views as well. Some believe that democracy is part of the rule of law.&lt;ref name="Stephenson" /&gt;

The "formal" interpretation is more widespread than the "substantive" interpretation. Formalists hold that the law must be prospective, well-known, and have characteristics of generality, equality, and certainty. Other than that, the formal view contains no requirements as to the content of the law.&lt;ref name="Tamanaha" /&gt; This formal approach allows laws that protect democracy and individual rights, but recognizes the existence of "rule of law" in countries that do not necessarily have such laws protecting democracy or individual rights.

The substantive interpretation holds that the rule of law intrinsically protects some or all individual rights.

The functional interpretation of the term "rule of law", consistent with the traditional English meaning, contrasts the "rule of law" with the "[[rule of man]]".&lt;ref name="Stephenson"&gt;Stephenson, Matthew. [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTLAWJUSTINST/0,,contentMDK:20763583~menuPK:1989584~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:1974062,00.html "Rule of Law as a Goal of Development Policy"], World Bank Research (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; According to the functional view, a society in which government officers have a great deal of discretion has a low degree of "rule of law", whereas a society in which government officers have little discretion has a high degree of "rule of law".&lt;ref name="Stephenson" /&gt; Upholding the rule of law can sometimes require the punishment of those who commit offenses that are [[justification (law)|justifiable]] under [[natural law]] but not statutory law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Justifiably Punishing the Justified|author=Heidi M. Hurd|journal=Michigan Law Review|volume=90|date=Aug 1992|pages=2203–2324|publisher=The Michigan Law Review Association|jstor=1289573|issue=8|doi=10.2307/1289573}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of law is thus somewhat at odds with flexibility, even when flexibility may be preferable.&lt;ref name="Stephenson" /&gt;

The ancient concept of rule ''of'' law can be distinguished from rule ''by'' law, according to political science professor Li Shuguang: "The difference&amp;nbsp;... is that, under the rule of law, the law is preeminent and can serve as a check against the abuse of power. Under rule by law, the law is a mere tool for a government, that suppresses in a legalistic fashion."&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, Brian 2004).

===Europe===
The preamble of the [[European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] says "the governments of European countries which are like-minded and have a common heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law".

In France and Germany the concepts of rule of law (''Etat de droit'' and ''Rechtsstaat'' respectively) are analogous to the principles of constitutional supremacy and protection of fundamental rights from public authorities (see [[public law]]), particularly the [[legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pech|first1=Laurent|title=Rule of Law in France|journal=Middlesex University – School of Law|ssrn=929099}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Letourneur|first1=M.|last2=Drago|first2=R.|title=The Rule of Law as Understood in France|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|date=1958|volume=7|issue=2|pages=147–177|doi=10.2307/837562|jstor=837562}}&lt;/ref&gt; France was one of the early pioneers of the ideas of the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peerenboom|first1=Randall|title=Asian discourses of rule of law : theories and implementation of rule of law in twelve Asian countries, France and the U.S.|date=2004|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|isbn=9780415326124|page=81|edition=Digital printing.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCXJFFudGd0C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzrmW7MfMAhViD8AKHestC7sQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Rule of Law in France}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German interpretation is more "rigid" but similar to that of France and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rule of Law in China: A Comparative Approach|date=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783662446225|pages=77–78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c7gjBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzrmW7MfMAhViD8AKHestC7sQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Zurn|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Nollkaemper|editor2-first=Andre|editor3-last=Peerenboom|editor3-first=Randy|title=Rule of Law Dynamics: In an Era of International and Transnational Governance|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139510974|pages=116–117|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAAgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzrmW7MfMAhViD8AKHestC7sQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finland's [[Constitution of Finland|constitution]] explicitly requires rule of law by stipulating that "the exercise of public powers shall be based on an Act. In all public activity, the law shall be strictly observed."

====United Kingdom====

In the United Kingdom the rule of law is a long-standing principle of the way the country is governed, dating from [[Magna Carta]] in 1215 and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].&lt;ref name=TSC-RoL-brief /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule of Law|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritemsruleoflaw.html|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite web|title=The rule of law and the prosecutor|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-rule-of-law-and-the-prosecutor|publisher=Attorney General's Office|accessdate=20 November 2014|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, [[Albert Venn Dicey|A. V. Dicey]], a constitutional scholar and lawyer, wrote of the twin pillars of the [[British constitution]] in his classic work ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'' (1885); these two pillars are the rule of law and [[parliamentary sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=John|last1=Hostettler|title=Champions of the rule of law|date=2011|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=9781904380689|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eh7bCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibuqX19cfMAhVJ0xoKHY_QBYEQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dicey&amp;f=false|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
All government officers of the United States, including the [[President of the United States|President]], the [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justices of the Supreme Court]], state judges and legislators, and all [[United States Congress|members of Congress]], pledge first and foremost to uphold the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. These oaths affirm that the rule of law is superior to the rule of any human leader.&lt;ref&gt;Vile, Josh (2006). ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-QXyUM5BhKUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=%22rule+of+law%22+and+%22shall+be+a+law%22+and+constitution&amp;ots=7hOE4WdL4m&amp;sig=PRZ1TgZMRfRKQ-p0k-8skOzRF7I#PPA80,M1 A Companion to the United States Constitution and its Amendments]''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] has considerable discretion: the legislative branch is free to decide what statutes it will write, as long as it stays within its [[enumerated powers]] and respects the constitutionally protected [[United States Bill of Rights|rights of individuals]]. Likewise, the judicial branch has a degree of [[judicial discretion]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/22/738/case.html Osborn v. Bank of the United States]'', 22 U. S. 738 (1824): "When [courts] are said to exercise a discretion, it is a mere legal discretion, a discretion to be exercised in discerning the course prescribed by law; and, when that is discerned, it is the duty of the court to follow it."&lt;/ref&gt; and the executive branch also has various discretionary powers including [[prosecutorial discretion]].

Scholars continue to debate whether the U.S. Constitution adopted a particular interpretation of the "rule of law", and if so, which one. For example, John Harrison asserts that the word "law" in the Constitution is simply defined as that which is legally binding, rather than being "defined by formal or substantive criteria", and therefore judges do not have discretion to decide that laws fail to satisfy such unwritten and vague criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, John. "Substantive Due Process and the Constitutional Text," ''[[Virginia Law Review]]'', vol. 83, p. 493 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Law Professor [[Frederick Mark Gedicks]] disagrees, writing that [[Cicero]], [[Augustine]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the framers of the U.S. Constitution believed that an unjust law was not really a law at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Gedicks|Gedicks, Frederick]]. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1072284 "An Originalist Defense of Substantive Due Process: Magna Carta, Higher-Law Constitutionalism, and the Fifth Amendment"], ''Emory Law Journal'', vol. 58, pp. 585–673 (2009).

Some modern scholars contend that the rule of law has been corroded during the past century by the instrumental view of law promoted by [[legal realism|legal realists]] such as [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] and [[Roscoe Pound]].  For example, Brian Tamanaha asserts: "The rule of law is a centuries-old ideal, but the notion that law is a means to an end became entrenched only in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, Brian. ''How an Instrumental View of Law Corrodes the Rule of Law'', twelfth annual Clifford Symposium on Tort Law and Social Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that the rule of law has survived but was transformed to allow for the exercise of discretion by administrators. For much of American history, the dominant notion of the rule of law, in this setting, has been some version of A. V. Dicey's: "no man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary Courts of the land." That is, individuals should be able to challenge an administrative order by bringing suit in a court of general jurisdiction. As the dockets of worker compensation commissions, public utility commissions and other agencies burgeoned, it soon became apparent that letting judges decide for themselves all the facts in a dispute (such as the extent of an injury in a worker's compensation case) would overwhelm the courts and destroy the advantages of specialization that led to the creation of administrative agencies in the first place. Even Charles Evans Hughes, a Chief Justice of the United States, believed "you must have administration, and you must have administration by administrative officers." By 1941, a compromise had emerged. If administrators adopted procedures that more or less tracked "the ordinary legal manner" of the courts, further review of the facts by "the ordinary Courts of the land" was unnecessary. That is, if you had your "day in commission", the rule of law did not require a further "day in court". Thus Dicey's rule of law was recast into a purely procedural form.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst, Daniel R. (2014). ''Tocqueville's Nightmare: The Administrative State Emerges in America, 1900–1940''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0199920860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Wilson]] said during the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787 that, "Laws may be unjust, may be unwise, may be dangerous, may be destructive; and yet not be so unconstitutional as to justify the Judges in refusing to give them effect." [[George Mason]] agreed that judges "could declare an unconstitutional law void. But with regard to every law, however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as judges to give it a free course."&lt;ref&gt;Snowiss, Sylvia. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JUj81cN6nyAC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=%22could+declare+an+unconstitutional+%22+%22Laws+may+be+unjust,+may+be+unwise,+may+be+dangerous%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=P0P-Sa6jGI_CzASqtpzhDQ Judicial Review and the Law of the Constitution]'', pp. 41–42 (Yale University Press 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] (joined by Justice [[Joseph Story]]) took a similar position in 1827: "When its existence as law is denied, that existence cannot be proved by showing what are the qualities of a law."&lt;ref&gt;''Ogden v. Saunders'', {{ussc|25|213|1827|pin=347}}. This was Marshall's only dissent in a constitutional case. The [[individualist anarchist]] [[Lysander Spooner]] later denounced Marshall for this part of his ''Ogden'' dissent. See {{cite book|first=Lysander|last=Spooner|title=Let's Abolish Government|publisher=Ludwig Von Mises Institute|year=2008|page=87}} These same issues were also discussed in an earlier U.S. Supreme Court case, ''Calder v. Bull'', {{ussc|3|386|1798}}, with Justices [[James Iredell]] and [[Samuel Chase]] taking opposite positions. See Presser, Stephen. "Symposium: Samuel Chase: In Defense of the Rule of Law and Against the Jeffersonians", ''[[Vanderbilt Law Review]]'', vol. 62, p. 349 (March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
East Asian cultures are influenced by two schools of thought, [[Confucianism]], which advocated good governance as rule by leaders who are benevolent and virtuous, and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], which advocated strict adherence to law. The influence of one school of thought over the other has varied throughout the centuries. One study indicates that throughout East Asia, only South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong have societies that are robustly committed to a law-bound state.&lt;ref&gt;Chu, Yun-Han et al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oNk6KpfXyYQC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%22Rule+of+Law%22+and+Korea+and+Japan&amp;lr=&amp;ei=0NMASsrtG5XQzATy8KC8BA#PPA31,M1 How East Asians View Democracy]'', pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Awzar Thi, a member of the [[Asian Human Rights Commission]], the rule of law in Thailand, Cambodia, and most of Asia is weak or nonexistent:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Apart from a number of states and territories, across the continent there is a huge gulf between the rule of law rhetoric and reality. In Thailand, the police force is an organized crime gang. In Cambodia, judges are proxies for the ruling political party ... That a judge may harbor political prejudice or apply the law unevenly are the smallest worries for an ordinary criminal defendant in Asia. More likely ones are: Will the police fabricate the evidence? Will the prosecutor bother to show up? Will the judge fall asleep? Will I be poisoned in prison? Will my case be completed within a decade?&lt;ref&gt;Thi, Awzar.

In countries such as China and Vietnam, the transition to a market economy has been a major factor in a move toward the rule of law, because the rule of law is important to foreign investors and to economic development. It remains unclear whether the rule of law in countries like China and Vietnam will be limited to commercial matters or will spill into other areas as well, and if so whether that spillover will enhance prospects for related values such as democracy and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Peerenboom, Randall ''in'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=YlKYLRjcoi0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22Rule+of+law+in+Asia%22&amp;ei=hcIASqy4KKGeygSpzf2vDQ Asian Discourses of Rule of Law], p. 39 (Routledge 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chinese law#Rule of law|rule of law in China]] has been widely discussed and debated by both legal scholars and politicians in China.

In Thailand, a kingdom that has had a constitution since the initial attempt to overthrow the absolute monarchy system in 1932, the rule of law has been more of a principle than actual practice.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Ancient prejudices and political bias have been present in the three branches of government with each of their foundings, and justice has been processed formally according to the law but in fact more closely aligned with royalist principles that are still advocated in the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In November 2013, Thailand faced still further threats to the rule of law when the executive branch rejected a supreme court decision over how to select senators.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In India, the longest constitutional text in the history of the world has governed that country since 1950. Although the [[Constitution of India]] may have been intended to provide details that would limit the opportunity for judicial discretion, the more text there is in a constitution the greater opportunity the judiciary may have to exercise [[Constitution of India#Judicial Review|judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;Baxi, Upendra ''in'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=YlKYLRjcoi0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22Rule+of+law+in+Asia%22&amp;ei=hcIASqy4KKGeygSpzf2vDQ#PPA336,M1 Asian Discourses of Rule of Law], pp. 336–337 (Routledge 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Indian journalist [[Harish Khare]], "The rule of law or rather the Constitution [is] in danger of being supplanted by the rule of judges."&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Simon. [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1556853,00.html "For Activist Judges, Try India"], ''[[Time Magazine]]'' (2006-11-08).&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan had centuries of tradition prior to [[World War II]], during which there were laws, but they did not provide a central organizing principle for society, and they did not constrain the powers of government (Boadi, 2001). As the 21st century began, the percentage of people who were lawyers and judges in Japan remained very low relative to western Europe and the United States, and legislation in Japan tended to be terse and general, leaving much discretion in the hands of bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Carl. [http://www.asiasociety.org/speeches/green.html "Japan: 'The Rule of Law Without Lawyers' Reconsidered"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623094753/http://www.asiasociety.org/speeches/green.html |date=2008-06-23 }}, Speech to the [[Asia Society]] (2001-03-14).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite book|last1=Goodman|first1=Carl F.|title=The rule of law in Japan : a comparative analysis|date=2008|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business|isbn=9789041127501|edition=2nd rev.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xIsmHbijQesC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
Various organizations are involved in promoting the rule of law.

=== The Council of Europe ===
[[Statute of the Council of Europe|The Statute]] of [[Council of Europe|the Council of Europe]] characterizes the rule of law as one of the core principles which the establishment of the organization based on. The paragraph 3 of the preamble of the Statute of the Council of Europe states: "Reaffirming their devotion to the spiritual and moral values which are the common heritage of their peoples and the true source of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law, principles which form the basis of all genuine democracy." The Statute lays the compliance with the rule of law principles as a condition for the European states to be a full member of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rm.coe.int/1680306052|title=Statute of the Council of Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Commission of Jurists===
In 1959, an event took place in [[New Delhi]] and speaking as the [[International Commission of Jurists]], made a declaration as to the fundamental principle of the rule of law. The event consisted of over 185 judges, lawyers, and law professors from 53 countries. This later became known as the [[Declaration of Delhi]]. During the declaration they declared what the rule of law implied. They included certain rights and freedoms, an independent judiciary and social, economic and cultural conditions conducive to human dignity. The one aspect not included in The Declaration of Delhi, was for rule of law requiring legislative power to be subject to [[judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, Jeffrey. [https://books.google.com/books?id=84tBKuObyNEC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=%22Declaration+of+Delhi%22+and+%22rule+of+law%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=5PLOSdWiJ4WoNsPhoMcH “Legislative Sovereignty and the Rule of Law"] in Tom Campbell, Keith D. Ewing and Adam Tomkins (eds), ''Sceptical Essays on Human Rights'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===
The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] defines the rule of law as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrol.org/article.aspx?article_id=3 What is the Rule of Law?], United Nations Rule of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
a principle of governance in which all persons, institutions and entities, public and private, including the State itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards. It requires, as well, measures to ensure adherence to the principles of supremacy of law, equality before the law, accountability to the law, fairness in the application of the law, separation of powers, participation in decision-making, legal certainty, avoidance of arbitrariness and procedural and legal transparency.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The General Assembly has considered rule of law as an agenda item since 1992, with renewed interest since 2006 and has adopted resolutions at its last three sessions.&lt;ref&gt;See United Nations General Assembly Resolutions A/RES/61/39, A/RES/62/70, A/RES/63/128.&lt;/ref&gt; The Security Council has held a number of thematic debates on the rule of law,&lt;ref&gt;See United Nations Security Council debates S/PRST/2003/15, S/PRST/2004/2, S/PRST/2004/32, S/PRST/2005/30, S/PRST/2006/28.&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted resolutions emphasizing the importance of these issues in the context of women, peace and security,&lt;ref&gt;See United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1325 and 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; children in armed conflict,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see United Nations Security Council Resolution 1612.&lt;/ref&gt; and the protection of civilians in armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see United Nations Security Council Resolution 1674.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peacebuilding Commission]] has also regularly addressed rule of law issues with respect to countries on its agenda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ruleoflaw/index.shtml United Nations and the Rule of Law].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] also requires the rule of law be included in [[human rights education]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] Part II, paragraph 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Bar Association===
The Council of the [[International Bar Association]] passed a resolution in 2009 endorsing a substantive or "thick" definition of the rule of law:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=9925C6FD-5804-407F-9D39-ECB9D6A8B9D4 Resolution of the Council of the International Bar Association of October 8, 2009, on the Commentary on Rule of Law Resolution (2005)].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;An independent, impartial judiciary; the presumption of innocence; the right to a fair and public trial without undue delay; a rational and proportionate approach to punishment; a strong and independent legal profession; strict protection of confidential communications between lawyer and client; equality of all before the law; these are all fundamental principles of the Rule of Law. Accordingly, arbitrary arrests; secret trials; indefinite detention without trial; cruel or degrading treatment or punishment; intimidation or corruption in the electoral process, are all unacceptable. The Rule of Law is the foundation of a civilised society. It establishes a transparent process accessible and equal to all. It ensures adherence to principles that both liberate and protect. The IBA calls upon all countries to respect these fundamental principles. It also calls upon its members to speak out in support of the Rule of Law within their respective communities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===World Justice Project===
As used by the [[World Justice Project]], a non-profit organization committed to advancing the rule of law around the world, the rule of law refers to a rules-based system in which the following four universal principles are upheld:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjusticeproject.org About the WJP].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# The government and its officials and agents are accountable under the law;
# The laws are clear, publicized, stable, fair, and protect fundamental rights, including the security of persons and property;
# The process by which the laws are enacted, administered, and enforced is accessible, fair, and efficient;
# Access to justice is provided by competent, independent, and ethical adjudicators, attorneys or representatives, and judicial officers who are of sufficient number, have adequate resources, and reflect the makeup of the communities they serve.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The World Justice Project has developed an Index to measure the extent to which countries adhere to the rule of law in practice. The [[World Justice Project#WJP Rule of Law Index|WJP Rule of Law Index]] is composed of 9 factors and 52 sub-factors, and covers a variety of dimensions of the rule of law—such as whether government officials are accountable under the law, and whether legal institutions protect fundamental rights and allow ordinary people access to justice.&lt;ref&gt;Agrast, M., Botero, J., Ponce, A., WJP [http://worldjusticeproject.org/sites/default/files/wjproli2011_0.pdf Rule of Law Index 2011.] Washington, D.C.: The World Justice Project. (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The International Development Law Organization (IDLO)===
The [[International Development Law Organization]] (IDLO) is an intergovernmental organization with a joint focus on the promotion of rule of law and development. It works to empower people and communities to claim their rights, and provides governments with the know-how to realize them.&lt;ref name="IDLO - What we Do"&gt;{{cite web|title=IDLO – What We Do|url=http://www.idlo.int/what-we-do|website=idlo.int|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It supports emerging economies and middle-income countries to strengthen their legal capacity and rule of law framework for sustainable development and economic opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/about-idlo/strategic-plan IDLO Strategic Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208164000/http://idlo.int/about-idlo/strategic-plan |date=2015-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only intergovernmental organization with an exclusive mandate to promote the rule of law and has experience working in more than 170 countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/about-idlo/mission-and-history IDLO Mission and History]&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Development Law Organization has a holistic definition of the rule of law:

&lt;blockquote&gt;More than a matter of due process, the rule of law is an enabler of justice and development. The three notions are interdependent; when realized, they are mutually reinforcing. For IDLO, as much as a question of laws and procedure, the rule of law is a culture and daily practice. It is inseparable from equality, from access to justice and education, from access to health and the protection of the most vulnerable. It is crucial for the viability of communities and nations, and for the environment that sustains them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/what-we-do/rule-law IDLO – Rule of Law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

IDLO is headquartered in Rome and has a branch office in [[The Hague]] and has Permanent Observer Status at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in New York City.

=== The International Network to Promote the Rule of Law (INPROL) ===
The [http://inprol.org International Network to Promote the Rule of Law (INPROL)] is a network of over 3,000 law practitioners from 120 countries and 300 organizations working on rule of law issues in post-conflict and developing countries from a policy, practice and research perspective.  INPROL is based at the US Institute of Peace (USIP) in partnership with the US Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Strategic Police Matters Unit, the Center of Excellence for Police Stability Unit, and William and Marry School of Law in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://inprol.org/about-inprol |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202002311/http://inprol.org/about-inprol |archive-date=2017-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its affiliate organizations include the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Folke Bernadotte Academy, International Bar Association, International Association of Chiefs of Police, International Association of Women Police, International Corrections and Prisons Association, International Association for Court Administration, International Security Sector Advisory Team at the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces, Worldwide Association of Women Forensic Experts (WAWFE), and International Institute for Law and Human Rights.

INPROL provides an online forum for the exchange of information about best practices.  Members may post questions, and expect a response from their fellow rule of law practitioners worldwide on their experiences in addressing rule of law issues.

==In relation to economics==
One important aspect of the rule-of-law initiatives is the study and analysis of the rule of law’s impact on [[economic development]]. The rule-of-law movement cannot be fully successful in transitional and developing countries without an answer to the question: does the rule of law matter for economic development or not?&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flores Ballesteros. "Corruption and development. Does the 'rule of law' factor weigh more than we think?" 54 Pesos May. 2008:54 Pesos 15 Nov 2008. [http://54pesos.org/2008/11/15/corruption-and-development-does-the-%E2%80%9Crule-of-law%E2%80%9D-factor-weigh-more-than-we-think/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constitutional economics]] is the study of the compatibility of economic and financial decisions within existing constitutional law frameworks, and such a framework includes government spending on the [[judiciary]], which, in many transitional and [[developing countries]], is completely controlled by the executive. It is useful to distinguish between the two methods of [[political corruption|corruption]] of the judiciary: corruption by the executive branch, in contrast to corruption by private actors.

The standards of [[constitutional economics]] can be used during annual [[budget process]], and if that budget planning is transparent then the rule of law may benefit. The availability of an effective court system, to be used by the [[civil society]] in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of previously authorized appropriations, is a key element for the success of the rule-of-law endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, "Defining the rules", ''The European Lawyer'', Issue 90, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rule of Law is especially important as an influence on the economic development in developing and transitional countries. To date, the term "rule of law" has been used primarily in the English-speaking countries, and it is not yet fully clarified even with regard to such well-established democracies as, for instance, Sweden, Denmark, France, Germany, or Japan. A common language between lawyers of common law and civil law countries as well as between legal communities of developed and developing countries is critically important for research of links between the rule of law and real economy.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova. [http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf "The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia, in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform"], edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The "rule of law" primarily connotes "protection of property rights".&lt;ref name=licht/&gt; The economist [[F. A. Hayek]] analyzed how the rule of law might be beneficial to the free market. Hayek proposed that under the rule of law, individuals would be able to make wise investments and future plans with some confidence in a successful return on investment when he stated: "under the Rule of Law the government is prevented from stultifying individual efforts by ''ad hoc'' action. Within the known rules of the game the individual is free to pursue his personal ends and desires, certain that the powers of government will not be used deliberately to frustrate his efforts."&lt;ref name=Serfdom&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=F.A.|title=The Road to Serfdom|year=1994|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-32061-8|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that weak rule of law (for example, discretionary regulatory enforcement) discourages investment. Economists have found, for example, that a rise in discretionary regulatory enforcement caused US firms to abandon international investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=Brad|last2=Stroup|first2=Caleb|year=2016|title=Does Anti-bribery enforcement deter foreign investment?|url=http://fcpa.stanford.edu/academic-articles/20150511-does-anti-bribery-enforcement-deter-foreign-investment.pdf|journal=Applied Economics Letters|volume=|pages=63–67|via=Taylor and Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In relation to culture==
The Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments or [[Roerich Pact]] is an inter-American [[treaty]]. The most important idea of the Roerich Pact is the [[legal recognition]] that the defense of [[cultural objects]] is more important than the use or destruction of that culture for military [[defense (military)|purposes]], and the protection of culture always has precedence over any [[military necessity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/75th_Anniversary_of_Roerich_Pact_Eng.html Peter Barenboim, Naeem Sidiqi, ''Bruges, the Bridge between Civilizations: The 75 Anniversary of the Roerich Pact, Grid Belgium, 2010]. {{ISBN|978-5-98856-114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Roerich Pact signed on April 15, 1935 by the representatives of 21 American states in the [[Oval Office]] of the [[White House]] (Washington, DC). It was the first international treaty signed in the Oval Office.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Stoumatoff, ''FDR's Unfinished Portrait: A Memoir'', University of Pittsburgh Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8229-3659-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] is the first [[international treaty]] that focuses on the protection of [[cultural property]] in armed conflict. It was signed at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] on 14 May 1954 and entered into force on 7 August 1956. As of June 2017, it has been ratified by 128 states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13637&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule of law can be hampered when there is a disconnect between legal and popular consensus. An example is [[intellectual property]]. Under the auspices of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], nominally strong copyright laws have been implemented throughout most of the world; but because the attitude of much of the population does not conform to these laws, a rebellion against ownership rights has manifested in rampant [[copyright infringement|piracy]], including an increase in [[peer-to-peer file sharing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=White Paper: Building a Culture of Respect for the Rule of Law|publisher=American Bar Association|author=Bica-Huiu, Alina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Russia, [[tax evasion]] is common and a person who admits he does not pay taxes is not judged or criticized by his colleagues and friends, because the tax system is viewed as unreasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~ieresgwu/assets/docs/demokratizatsiya%20archive/07-02_pope.pdf|title=The Rule of Law and Russian Culture – Are They Compatible?|author=Pope, Ronald R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bribery]] likewise has different normative implications across cultures.&lt;ref name=licht&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Comparative Economics|volume=35|issue=4|date=December 2007|pages=659–688|title=Culture rules: The foundations of the rule of law and other norms of governance|author=Licht, Amir N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The Rule of Law has been criticised by several scholars, authors, philosophers and activists as unrealistic, hypocritical or dangerous.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Author [[Peter Gelderloos]] argues that attempting to create a specialised class of judicial authority that is separate from the community will inevitably lead to corruption. He points out that nonviolent drug-related offences receive far more police and media attention than workplace injuries or pollution, which kill far more people each year. He argues that [[restorative justice]] is a far more effective and humane alternative to prisons, courts and the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Works|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''sentence function''' refers to a speaker's purpose in uttering a specific sentence, phrase, or clause. Whether a listener is present or not is sometimes irrelevant. It answers the question: "Why has this been said?" The four basic sentence functions in the world's languages include the ''declarative'', ''interrogative'', ''exclamative'', and the ''imperative''. These correspond to a ''statement'', ''question'', ''exclamation'', and ''command'' respectively. Typically, a sentence goes from one function to the next through a combination of changes in word order, intonation, the addition of certain auxiliaries or particles, or other times by providing a special verbal form. The four main categories can be further specified as being either ''communicative'' or ''informative''.

==Communicative vs. informative==
While [[communication]] is traditionally defined as the transfer of [[information]], the two terms, under present context, are differentiated as follows below:

===Communicative sentences===
These types of sentences are more intended for the speaker's sake than for any potential listener. They are meant more for the speaker's immediate wants and needs. These sentences tend to be less intentional (out of frustration for example), in general more literal, more primitive, and are usually about the here and now. Because of these features, it is generally speculated that this is pretty much the basis or limitation of any form of animal communication. (Speculated because scientists will never truly be able to understand non-human forms of communication like we do our own; although studies with "talking" primates have clued us in to a certain degree.)

====Exclamatory====
{{citation needed span|date=September 2018|text=An exclamative or exclamatory sentence is released because of, and expresses strong emotion. They many times feel like involuntary reactions to a situation, yet they ''can'' technically be stifled if need be. And while exclamatives most usually manifest themselves as one or two word interjections, they can also come as major sentences. They are essentially unfiltered vocalizations of our feelings, and a form of self-talk because they are directed either at the speaker themself or at nobody in particular. In [[punctuation]], an exclamative is ended with an exclamation mark.

* ''Ouch!''
* ''I'll never finish this paper in time!''}}

====Imperative====
An imperative sentence gives anything from a command or order, to a request, direction, or instruction. Imperative sentences are more intentional than exclamatory sentences and ''do'' require an audience; as their aim is to get the person(s) being addressed either to do or to not do something. And although this function usually deals with the immediate temporal vicinity, its scope can be extended, i.e. you can order somebody to ''move out as soon as you find yourself a job''. The negative imperative can also be called the ''prohibitive'' and the inclusive plural imperative, the ''hortative''. It is debatable whether the imperative is only truly possible in the second person. The vocative case of nouns can be said to indicate the imperative as well since it does not seek information, but rather a reaction from the one being addressed. An imperative can end in either a period or an exclamation point depending on delivery.

* ''Look at me.''
* ''After separating them from the yolks, beat the whites until they are light and fluffy.''

===Informative sentences===
Informative sentences are more for the mutual benefit of both the listener ''and'' the speaker, and, in fact, require more of an interaction between both parties involved. They are more intentional or premeditated, less essential, more cooperative, and they aim to either provide or retrieve information, making them quintessential abstractions. But perhaps the most differentiating quality that distinguishes informative sentences from the communicative is that the former more naturally and freely make use of [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]]. Displacement refers to information lost in time and space which allows us to communicate ideas relating to the past or future (not just the now), and that have taken or can take place at a separate location (from here).  To an extent, this is one of the biggest differences between human communication and that of other animals.

====Declarative====
The declarative sentence is the most common kind of sentence in language, in most situations, and in a way can be considered the default function of a sentence. What this means essentially is that when a language modifies a sentence in order to form a question or give a command, the base form will always be the declarative. In its most basic sense, a declarative states an idea (either objectively or subjectively on the part of the speaker; and may be either true or false) for the sheer purpose of transferring intel. In writing, a statement will end with a period.

* ''Roses are red and violets are blue.''
* ''She must be out of her mind.''

====Interrogative====
An interrogative sentence asks a question and hence ends with a question mark. In speech, it almost universally ends in a rising inflection. Its effort is to try to gather information that is presently unknown to the interrogator, or to seek validation for a preconceived notion held. Beyond seeking confirmation or contradiction, sometimes it is approval or permission that is sought as well, among other reasons one could have for posing a question. The one exception in which it isn't information that is needed, is when the question happens to be rhetorical (see [[Sentence function#Allofunctional implicature|allofunctional implicature]] section below). While an imperative is a call for action, an interrogative is a call for information.

* ''What do you want?''
* ''Are you feeling well?''

==Declarative vs. affirmative vs. positive==
A declarative statement should not be deemed synonymous with an [[affirmative (linguistics)|affirmative]] one. This is because although a declarative statement can state facts (given that the speaker is not consciously lying), it can also express something which is not true. The information he or she is providing, regardless of whether it be true or not in ''reality'', is in fact true or false to that speaker. Therefore, a declarative can be either in the affirmative or in the [[negation (linguistics)|negative]], and we can say that, ''Joanna is late'' and ''Joanna is not late'', both technically qualify as declarative sentences. ''Declarative'' refers to a sentence's function or purpose, while ''affirmative'' and ''negative'' deal with a sentence's veracity, or grammatical polarity, which is why the different terms can overlap simultaneously.

Though not as erroneous as the above misnomer, there is a clouding that can occur between the slight distinction of the affirmative, and the [[positive (linguistics)|positive]]. Although it semantically speaking comes natural that ''positive'' is the opposite of ''negative'', and therefore should be completely synonymous with ''affirmative'', grammatically speaking, once again they tend to be separate entities; depending on specificity. ''Positive'' in linguistic terms refers to the degree of the quality of an adjective or adverb, while ''affirmative'' refers to the perceived validity of the ''entire'' sentence.

Thus, all three terms being separate entities, an adjective or adverb can be in the positive degree but expressed in the negative, so that the sentence, ''This hummer does not seem to be eco-friendly'', has all negative, positive, and declarative properties.

In fact, an exclamatory, imperative, as well as a question can be in the negative form: ''I can't do this!'', ''Don't touch me'', ''Don't you want to?''

==Allofunctional implicature==
There are many instances in which a sentence can be grammatically shaped as one function, yet in actual execution, may serve a completely different purpose than suggested by the way it was constructed; hence, ''allofunctional'', to mean 'serving a different purpose than originally intended'. Or in other words, it is very subtly yet unequivocally implied by process of [[pragmatics]] that its function ''must'' be changed to another in order for the sentence to make sense in the present context of conversation.

A classic example would be the "question": ''Could you pass the salt?''

In the above sentence, although it is grammatically structured as a question, it can quite safely be inferred that the speaker is not inquiring as to whether the person they are addressing is physically capable of passing the salt at the dinnertable or not. What the speaker really wants is to get the salt. It is a request, or call for action as opposed to information, thus making the sentence allofunctional (note that adding a word like 'please' at the end would tend to make this point clearer, and when posed as a question, this request is perceived as being more polite than if it were simply in the natural imperative). Therefore, what at first may come off as an interrogative sentence upon initial delivery, the listener must almost immediately reinterpret as an imperative and respond accordingly.

Other examples include;

*'''Exclamative interrogative''' (interrogative structure with exclamative function): ''Why does this keep happening to me?''
**I might utter this phrase only to vent out my frustration vocally.
*'''Imperative declarative''' (declarative structure with imperative function): ''I would feel more comfortable if you wore your seatbelt.''
**If I say this to you I'm strongly urging you to buckle up.

The list goes on, and as a matter of fact, all 12 combinations between each of the four functions and their three other counterparts should be theoretically possible.

Another important point to note is that the allofunctionality of a sentence is completely language specific as to how it differentiates function. To exemplify this, we can look at English and generalize that imperative sentences, when affirmative, tend to begin with the verb, while declarative sentences that are prosaic will almost always start with the subject (this is because in the imperative, the subject is implied, or obviously unmistakable, since it is the subject itself which is being spoken to). All that being taken into account, we can more clearly see why a statement such as, ''You are not going to that bar. (I forbid it)'', would qualify as allofunctional.

discussed sentences that have "perlocutionary force": uttering them (at least
in the correct context) directly causes something to be or to occur.
For example, "I promise", "I warn", "I forgive" or "I resign". Such utterances
do not fit readily into any of the traditional sentence functions described above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13035">'''Somatic theory''' is a theory of human social behavior based loosely on the [[somatic marker hypothesis]] of [[António Damásio]], which proposes a mechanism by which emotional processes can guide (or bias) behavior, particularly decision-making, as well as the [[attachment theory]] of [[John Bowlby]] and the [[self psychology]] of [[Heinz Kohut]], especially as consolidated by [[Allan Schore]]. 

It draws on various philosophical models from ''[[Genealogy of Morals|On the Genealogy of Morals]]'' of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] through [[Martin Heidegger]] on ''das Man'', [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] on the [[lived body]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] on social practices to [[Michel Foucault]] on discipline, as well as theories of [[performativity]] emerging out of the [[speech act]] theory of [[J. L. Austin]], especially as developed by [[Judith Butler]] and [[Shoshana Felman]];&lt;ref&gt;See Felman, Shoshana. (1980/2003). ''The Scandal of the Speaking Body: Don Juan With J.L. Austin, or Seduction in Two Languages''. Translated by Catherine Porter. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; some somatic theorists have also tied somaticity to performance in the schools of actor training developed by [[Constantin Stanislavski|Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]].

''Consciousness, Literature and the Arts'' 3.2 (August).&lt;/ref&gt; applies Damasio’s somatic-marker hypothesis to critical thinking as an embodied performance, and provides a review of the theoretical literature in performance studies that supports something like Damasio’s approach:

* [[Howard Gardner]]’s [[theory of multiple intelligences]], especially bodily-kinesthetic intelligence
* Thomas Hanna’s insistence that “We cannot sense without acting and we cannot act without sensing”&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Thomas. (1995). “What is Somatics?” In Don Hanlon Johnson, ed., ''Bone, Breath and Gesture'', 345. Berkeley: North Atlantic.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen's movement-pedagogy
* [[Constantin Stanislavski|Konstantin Stanislavski]]’s acting theory that “In every physical action, unless it is purely mechanical, there is concealed some inner action, some feelings. This is how the two levels of life in a part are created, the inner and the outer. They are intertwined. A common purpose brings them together and reinforces the unbreakable bond.”&lt;ref&gt;Stanislavski, Konstantin. (1961/1989). ''Creating a Role'', 228. Translated by Elizabeth Reynolds Hapgood.

''International Studies Quarterly'' 51: 53-77.&lt;/ref&gt; applies Damasio's somatic-marker hypothesis to the [[cognitive linguistics]] of [[Gilles Fauconnier]] and [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]]&lt;ref&gt;See Fauconnier and Turner (2002), ''The Way We Think''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson (philosopher)|Mark Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;See Lakoff and Johnson (1999), ''Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Thought''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; especially Fauconnier and Turner's theory of [[conceptual blending]] and Lakoff and Johnson's [[embodied mind]] theory of [[metaphor]]. His goal in importing somatic theory into cognitive linguistics is to show that

:the primary purpose of achieving human scale is not to help us ''apprehend'' a situation, but rather to help us to know how to ''feel'' about it. Especially in political and religious discourse--situations where speakers are attempting to influence their listeners' values and decision-making processes--I would like to argue that the achievement of human scale is intended primarily to import normativity to the blend, which is accomplished through the recruitment of human-scale emotional-somatic reactions. This argument is essentially an attempt to connect of conceptual blending theorists with those of neuroscientists who argue for the importance of somatic states and emotional reactions in human value-creation and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;"Conceptual Blending," p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Douglas Robinson ===

[[Douglas Robinson (academic)|Douglas Robinson]] first began developing a somatic theory of language for a keynote presentation at the 9th American Imagery Conference in Los Angeles, October, 1985, based on [https://archive.is/20130122002312/http://eideticinstitute.com/joomla/more-infmormation/6-more-about-dr-akhter-ahsen Ahkter Ahsen]'s theory of somatic response to images as the basis for therapeutic transformations; in contradistinction to Ahsen's model, which rejected Freud's "[[talking cure]]" on the grounds that words do not awaken somatic responses, Robinson argued that there is a very powerful somatics of language. He later incorporated this notion into ''The Translator's Turn'' (1991), drawing on the (passing) somatic theories of [[William James]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and [[Kenneth Burke]] in order to argue that somatic response may be "idiosomatic" (somatically idiosyncratic) but typically is "ideosomatic" (somatically ideological, or shaped and guided by society), and that the ideosomatics of language explains how language remains stable enough for communication to be possible. This work preceded the Damasio group's first scientific publication on the somatic-marker hypothesis in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, Antonio R., Daniel Tranel, and Hannah Damasio. (1991). "Somatic Markers and the Guidance of Behaviour: Theory and Preliminary Testing." In H.S. Levin, H.M. Eisenberg and A.L. Benton (eds.), ''Frontal lobe function and dysfunction'', 217-229. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and Robinson did not begin to incorporate Damasio's somatic-marker hypothesis into his somatic theory until later in the 1990s.

In ''Translation and Taboo'' (1996) Robinson drew on the protosomatic theories of [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jacques Lacan]], and [[Gregory Bateson]] to explore the ways in which the ideosomatics of [[taboo]] structure (and partly sanction and conceal) the translation of [[Religious text|sacred texts]]. His first book to draw on Damasio's somatic-marker hypothesis is ''Performative Linguistics'' (2003); there he draws on [[J. L. Austin]]'s theory of [[speech acts]], [[Jacques Derrida]]'s theory of [[Citationality|iterability]], and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s theory of [[dialogism]] to argue that performativity as an activity of the speaking body is grounded in somaticity. He also draws on Daniel Simeoni's application of [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s theory of ''[[habitus (sociology)|habitus]]'' in order to argue that his somatics of translation as developed in ''The Translator's Turn'' actually explains translation norms more fully than [[Gideon Toury]] in ''Descriptive Translation Studies and beyond'' (1995).&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam and Philadelphia: John Benjamins, 1995, pp. 56ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Robinson began writing a series of books exploring somatic theory in different communicative contexts: [[modernism|modernist]]/[[Russian formalism|formalist]] theories of [[Defamiliarization|estrangement]] (Robinson 2008), translation as ideological pressure (Robinson 2011), [[first-year composition|first-year writing]] (Robinson 2012), and the [[refugee]] experience, [[decolonization|(de)colonization]], and the [[transgenerational trauma|intergenerational transmission of trauma]] (Robinson 2013).&lt;ref&gt;See [[Somatic theory#Further reading|Further Reading]] for bibliographical information.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Robinson's articulation, somatic theory has four main planks:

# the ''stabilization'' of social constructions through '''[[somatic marker hypothesis|somatic markers]]'''
# the ''interpersonal sharing'' of such stabilizations through the '''mimetic somatic transfer'''
# the regulatory ('''ideosomatic''') ''circulation'' or ''reticulation'' of such somatomimeses through an entire group in the '''somatic exchange'''
# the "[[kludge|klugey]]" nature of social regulation through the somatic exchange, leading to various '''idiosomatic''' failures and refusals to be fully regulated

In addition, he has added concepts along the way: '''the [[proprioception]] of the body politic''' as a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] balancing between too much familiarity and too much strangeness (Robinson 2008); tensions between '''loconormativity''' and '''xenonormativity''', the '''[[Exosomatic memory|exosomatization]]''' of places, objects, and skin color, and '''paleosomaticity''' (Robinson 2013); '''ecosis''' and '''icosis''' (unpublished work).

{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}

The '''Sonning Prize''' ({{lang-da|Sonningprisen}}) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] culture prize awarded biennially for outstanding contributions to European culture. It is named after the Danish editor and author Carl Johan Sonning (1879–1937), who established the prize by his [[Will and testament|will]]. The prize was first awarded in 1950, although its second winner was in 1959 after an eight-year hiatus. It was then awarded every year from 1959 to 1971, and then every second year from 1971 to 1991, and again from 1994 to present.

Prize winners are chosen by a committee chaired by the rector of the [[University of Copenhagen]] which decides on laureates from a selection of candidates proposed by European universities. The prize amounts to [[Danish krone|DKK]] 1 million (~[[Euro|€]]135,000) and the award ceremony is always held on or around 19 April (Sonning's birthday) in [[Copenhagen]].

'''''The Dinosaur and the Missing Link: A Prehistoric Tragedy''''' is a 1915 American comedy silent film animated by [[Willis O'Brien]]. The film was distributed by [[Thomas Edison]]'s film company ''Conquest Pictures'' in 1917.

The film is also known as '''''The Dinosaur and the Baboon''''' (American reissue title).

== Plot ==
It starts with a caveman going to give some flowers to a cavegirl. He fails when he hits a tree. However, he keeps going. However, the "Self Appointed Hero" of the story steals the girl's heart. Meanwhile, an evil [[gorilla]]-like [[ape]] called "Wild Willie" the Missing Link is watching them. When the Missing Link goes to the lake to get some water, where the [[dinosaur]] is, the dinosaur kills the Missing Link and goes away. Then the "Hero" finds the Missing Link and takes the credit for killing Wild Willie.

==Background and publication history==

Like his other posthumous work, ''The Nick Adams Stories'' may have been reworked and edited in a manner he never intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fame beyond the grave |author=Nicolette Jones |newspaper=Telegraph |date= 3 Jul 2009 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/5720775/Fame-beyond-the-grave.html |accessdate=2010-01-15 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer for ''The New York Times'' had this to say about one of the stories "Three Shots", a section Hemingway originally cut from "[[Indian Camp]]" – one of his earliest stories first published in 1925 volume ''[[In Our Time (short story collection)|In Our Time]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Alone, "Three Shots" stands as a vignette of a boy's fear, accorded sympathy by his father and impatience by his uncle.

'''Tin-glazing''' is the process of giving [[ceramic]] items a tin-based [[ceramic glaze|glaze]] that is white, glossy and opaque, which is normally applied to red or buff [[earthenware]]. The opacity and whiteness of tin glaze encourage its frequent decoration with [[overglaze]] colour.  [[Majolica]], [[delftware]] and [[faience]] are among the terms used for common types of [[tin-glazed pottery]].  An alternative is [[Lead-glazed earthenware|lead-glazing]], where the basic glaze is transparent; some types of pottery use both.&lt;ref&gt;For example polychrome [[Delftware]]; Savage, 160&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Tin dioxide|Tin oxide]] is valued in glazes as both an [[opacifier]] and as a white colorant.&lt;ref&gt;’The Glazer’s Book’ – 2nd edition. ''A.B.Searle.The Technical Press Limited.'' London. 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; Tin oxide has long been used to produce a white, opaque and glossy glaze.&lt;ref name="C.W.Parmelee 1973"&gt;’Ceramic Glazes’ Third edition. C.W.Parmelee &amp; C.G.Harman.

==History==
{{Main|Tin-glazed pottery}}
[[File:Chinese white ware and Iraqi earthenware bowls 9th 10th century both found in Iraq.jpg|thumb|350px|Chinese [[porcelain]] white ware bowl, not tin-glazed (left), found in [[Iran]], and Iraqi tin-glazed earthenware bowl (right) found in [[Iraq]], both 9-10th century, an example of [[Chinese influences on Islamic pottery]]. [[British Museum]].]]
The earliest tin-glazed pottery appears to have been made in [[Abbasid]] [[Iraq]] (750-1258 AD)/[[Mesopotamia]] in the 8th century, fragments having been excavated during the First World War from the palace of [[Samarra]] about fifty miles north of [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name=CaigerSmith73&gt;Caiger-Smith, Alan, ''Tin-Glaze Pottery in Europe and the Islamic World: The Tradition of 1000 Years in Maiolica, Faience and Delftware'', London, Faber and Faber, 1973 {{ISBN|0-571-09349-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From Mesopotamia, tin glazes spread to Islamic Egypt (868–905 AD) during the 10th century, and then to Andalusian Spain (711-1492 AD), leading to the maximum development of Islamic [[lusterware]].&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;Mason, R. B., and M. S. Tite, "The beginnings of tin-opacification of pottery glazes", ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' 39:41-58, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borgia, I., B. Brunettu, A. Sgamellontti, F. Shokouhi, P. Oliaiy, J. Rahighi, M. Lamehi-rachti, M. Mellini, and C. Viti. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 

The history of tin glazes in the Islamic world is disputed. One possible reason for the earlier production of tin-glazed wares could be attributed to the trade between the [[Abbasid Empire]] and ancient China from the 8th to 9th century onwards, resulting in imitation of white Chinese [[stoneware]] by local Islamic potters.&lt;ref&gt;Kleimann, B. 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Another might be local glaze-making rather than foreign influence, supported by the similarility between the chemical and microstructural features of pre-Islamic white opaque glazes and that on the first tin-opacified wares&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt;
[[File:Dutch delft tile topsham.JPG|thumb|Dutch [[delftware]] tin-glazed tile]]

From the Middle East, tin-glaze spread through the Islamic world to [[Hispano-Moresque ware|Spain]]. In the 13th century, tin glazes reached [[Italy]], where the earliest recorded reference to their use is in the 1330s,&lt;ref&gt;’Ceramic Glazes’ C.W.Parmelee. ''Industrial Publications, Inc''. Chicago. 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the emergence of Italian [[Maiolica]]. Amongst others, [[Luca della Robbia]], born in Florence about 1400, used tin oxide as an opacifier in glazes.&lt;ref&gt;’Pottery And Ceramics.’ E.Rosenthal. Pelican Books. Harmondsworth. 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Potters began to draw polychrome paintings on the white opaque surface with metallic oxides such as cobalt oxide and to produce [[lustreware]]. The off-white fired body of [[Delftware]] and English [[Majolica]] was made to appear white, and hence mimic the appearance of Chinese porcelain, by the application of a glaze opacified and coloured white by the addition of tin oxide.&lt;ref&gt;’Pottery And Ceramics.’ E.Rosenthal. ''Pelican Books''. Harmondsworth. 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;’Pottery’ C.J.Noke &amp; H.J.Plant. Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, Ltd. London. 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current use and alternatives===
Tin oxide has been widely used as the opacifier in sanitaryware glazes.&lt;ref&gt;''Ceramics Glaze Technology.'' J. R. Taylor &amp; A. C. Bull. The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press. Oxford. 1986&lt;/ref&gt; In this application, additions of up to 6% are reported to be in then-current use.&lt;ref&gt;’Sanitaryware’. D.Fortuna. ''Gruppo Editoriale Faenza Editrice s.p.a''. Florence. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of tin oxide rose considerably during the 1914-1918 war, and resulted in a search for cheaper alternatives.&lt;ref name="Ceramics Glaze Technology 1986"/&gt; The first successful replacement was [[zirconia]] and later [[zircon]].&lt;ref&gt;‘Ceramics Glaze Technology.’ J.R.Taylor &amp; A.C.Bull. ''The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press''. Oxford. 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst zirconium compounds are not as effective their low price led to a gradual increase in popularity with an associated reduction in use of tin oxide. Today, tin oxide usage in glazes finds limited use in conjunction with zircon compounds, although it is generally restricted to specialist low temperature applications and use by studio potters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ceramic Glazes 1960"&gt;‘Ceramic Glazes.’ F.Singer &amp; W.L.German. ''Borax Consolidated Limited''. London. 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;  The whiteness resulting from the use of zirconia has been described as more ''clinical'' than that from tin oxide, and is consequently preferred in some applications.&lt;ref&gt;'Science For Craft Potters And Enamellers.' K.Shaw. ''A.H.&amp; A.W.Reed.'' Wellington. 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The Koninklijke Tichelaar Makkum factory, or Royal Tichelaar Makkum, based in [[Makkum, Wûnseradiel|Makkum]], [[Friesland]] continue the production [[Delftware]] using tin-glazed [[earthenware]].&lt;ref&gt;''Klei/Glas/Keram''. 13, No.4, 1992. Pg.103-106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tichelaar.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The nature of tin glaze==
[[File:SnO2powder.jpg|thumb|[[Tin dioxide]], the raw ingredient in Tin-glazing.]]
For glaze use only one tin compound, tin (IV) oxide [[Tin dioxide]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and also called stannic acid,&lt;ref&gt;’A Treatise On Ceramic Industries.’ E.Bourry. Fourth edition. ''Scott, Greenwood &amp; Son''. London. 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; is commercially exploited. Opacity is produced in glazes by the addition of some substance to scatter and reflect some of the incident light. 

The opacity of glaze could be determined by the particles which spread through the glaze, therefore the light is absorbed by the particles, being scattered back before reaching the ceramic body, leading to the opaque glaze. As a result, the concentration of the absorbing or scattering particles in the glaze could determine the degree of opacification. Generally speaking, the more different the [[refractive index]] between the particles and the glaze matrix, the larger the opacity. Similarly, the closer the particle size to the light wavelength (100-1000&amp;nbsp;nm for [[visible light]]) and the more irregular the surface, the larger the degree of opacification.

[[tin dioxide|Tin oxide]] remains in suspension in vitreous matrix of the fired glazes, and, with its high refractive index being sufficiently different from the matrix, light is scattered, and hence increases the [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] of the glaze. The degree of dissolution increases with the firing temperature, and hence the extent of opacity diminishes.&lt;ref&gt;’A Treatise On Ceramic Industries.’ E.Bourry. Fourth edition. Scott, Greenwood &amp; son. London. 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; Although dependent on the other constituents the solubility of tin oxide in glaze melts is generally low. Its solubility is increased by Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduced by CaO, BaO, ZnO, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and to a limited extent PbO.&lt;ref name="C.W.Parmelee 1973"/&gt;

Some research on medieval tin glaze has shown that the particle size of tin oxide which appears as cassiterite is around several hundred nanometer, which corresponds to the range of wavelength of visible light.&lt;ref name=Molera1999&gt;Molera, J., Pradell T., Salvadó, N. and Vendrell-Saz, M. "Evidence of Tin Oxide Recrystallization in Opacified Lead Glazes", ''Journal of American Ceramic Society'', 1999, 82:2871-2875&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the tin oxide is presented not only as small crystals but also as aggregates of particles. These factors – the high refractive index, the low solubility in glazes and the particle size make tin oxide an excellent opacifier.    

In the beginning of the use of tin oxide, it is mainly viewed as a [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] layer between the glaze and ceramic body. This could be seen from the [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] photomicrographs of some earlier Islamic glazed ceramics, of which the particles of tin oxide are concentrated at the interface, together with the existence of [[wollastonite]], [[diopside]] and air bubble as other opacifiers.&lt;ref name=Manson&gt;Manson, R. B., and M. S. Tite, "The beginnings of tin-opacification of pottery glazes", ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' 39:41-58, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  The microanalysis of later tin glazes reveals the distribution of tin oxide through the glazes rather than just at the interface, which indicates that tin oxide is really acting as an [[opacifier]] instead of only a surface coating layer.&lt;ref name=Manson/&gt;

Lead is usually brought into the glazes with tin oxide. The reaction between lead and tin oxide results in the [[Recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallisation]] of tin oxide,&lt;ref name=Molera1999/&gt; and thus enhances the degree of opacification in tin-opacified glazes than in tin-opacified glass. A high PbO/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio is often found in ancient glazes. During the firing process, [[lead(II) oxide|lead oxide]] reacts with quartz at approximately 550℃ to form PbSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which then reacts with tin oxide to produce lead-tin oxide (PbSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) at a temperature higher than 600℃. After the formation of lead-tin oxide, the melting of PbSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, PbO and PbSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; occurs at the temperature in the range of 700℃ to 750℃, resulting in the dissolution of PbSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The degree of the crystallisation of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases with the increasing of temperature. During either heating or cooling, the recrystallisation is taken place until the supply of tin is exhausted. In the second heating, lead in the form of lead oxide no longer reacts with tin oxide to form lead silicate, thus the recrystallised [[cassiterite]] (SnO2) remain undissolved and precipitate in the glazes. The [[nucleation]] and [[Crystal growth|growth]] rates of the precipitation depend upon temperature and time. The particle size of the cassiterite developed is also dependent on the temperature, and smaller than that used in the very beginning. It is the smaller particle size of the recrystallised SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in glazes that increases the opacity in tin-opacified glazes. Besides the increasing the opacity, the high lead oxide to tin oxide ratio also reduces the melting point of glazes, lead to a lower firing temperature during production.&lt;ref&gt;Tite, M. S., T. Pradell, and A. Shortland. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==The technology of tin-glazing==

===Analyses and recipes===
The earliest [[Middle East]]ern tin glazes used [[calcium]], [[lead]] and [[sodium]] [[Chemical compound|compounds]]  as fluxes in combination with the [[silica]] in silica. An Islamic opaque white glaze has been analysed, and is quoted below as a Seger formula:&lt;ref&gt;al-Saad, Z. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  
::*PbO=0.32
::*CaO=0.32
::*K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O=0.03
::*Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O=0.29
::*MgO=0.04
::*Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=0.03
::*SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=1.73
::*SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=0.07

In this recipe, the addition of [[alkali]] helps to increase the hardness of the surface and clarify the colour of the glaze as well. With the development of tin glazes, the significant amount of tin oxide indicates its deliberate addition as an opacifier. A recipe involving the use of three ingredients was given in Abu’l-Qasim’s treatise from [[Iran|Persia]] in the 14th century: a glass-[[frit]] of [[quartz]] and [[potash]], a lead-tin [[calx]] and a [[calcination]] of [[limestone]] and quartz.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, J. 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, with the spread of tin glazes, lead gradually became the principal background in tin glazes, though a small proportion of alkali was still introduced in order to increase the [[fusibility]]. No specific recipes alluding to tin glazes in [[Spain]] have been found in ancient archives. However, recent research has shown that, at least since the 10th century AD, most Islamic white glazes in Spain were lead-silica glazes with tin oxide as an opacifier. That is, no alkaline glazes or lead-alkaline glazes have been found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Molera, J., M. Vendrell-Saz, and J. Pérez-Arantegui. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Piccolpasso recorded several glazes used in Italy in the 1550s, all variations of lead, tin, lime, soda and potash glazes.  It is believed early Spanish glazes were similar.&lt;ref name=CaigerSmith73/&gt;

A Seger analysis of a tin glaze from the early 20th century is:&lt;ref&gt;'A Text-Book On Ceramic Calculations.' W.Jackson. ''Longhmans, Green And Co.'' London. 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;
::*PbO=0.52
::*CaO=0.16
::*K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O=0.03
::*Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O=0.29
::*Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=0.15
::*SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=2.77
::*SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=0.23

A more recent recipe is:&lt;ref name=CaigerSmith73/&gt;
::*[[Lead]] bisilicate [[frit]]: 74%
::*[[China clay]]: 10%
::*[[Calcium carbonate|Whiting]]: 2%
::*[[Flint]]: 4%
::*[[Tin oxide]]: 10%
And another is:&lt;ref name="Ceramics Glaze Technology 1986"/&gt;
::*Potassium [[feldspar]]: 65%
::*[[Calcium carbonate|Limestone]]: 11%
::*[[Silica]]: 11%
::*[[Zinc oxide]]: 9%
::*[[Tin oxide]]: 4%

===As a glaze colorant===
In combination with chromium compounds addition of 0.5 - 1.5% tin oxide to a glaze result in a pink colour, with such glazes being known as Chrome-tin pinks.&lt;ref&gt;‘An Introduction To The Technology Of Pottery.’ P.Rado. ''The Institute Of Ceramics''. Oxford. 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Ceramics Glaze Technology.’ J.R.Taylor &amp; A.C.Bull. ''The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press.'' Oxford. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with small additions of zinc oxide and titanium oxide, additions of tin oxide up to 18% to lead glazes can produce a satin or vellum surface finish.&lt;ref name="Ceramic Glazes 1960"/&gt; The firing temperatures of such glazes are low, in the region of 950 – 1000 ℃ because of the variable degrees of solution of the individual oxides.&lt;ref name="Ceramics Glaze Technology 1986"/&gt; The amount of tin oxide used for coloured glazes depends upon the opacifying property of the chosen chromophore and the intensity of the colour desired; if a deep colour is required less opacifier will be needed than for pastel shades.&lt;ref&gt;’Ceramic Glazes’ C.W.Parmelee. ''Industrial Publications, Inc.'' Chicago. 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacture===

Though the recipe of tin glazes may differ in different sites and periods, the process of the production of tin glazes is similar. Generally speaking, the first step of the production of tin glazes is to mix tin and lead in order to form oxides, which was then added to a glaze matrix (alkali-silicate glaze, for example) and heated.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, S. R. 1997&lt;/ref&gt; After the mixture cooled, the tin oxide crystallises as what has been mentioned above, therefore generates the so-called white tin-opacified glazes. Besides, the body of tin-opacified wares is generally [[List of vineyard soil types|calcareous clays]] containing 15-25% CaO, of which the [[thermal expansion coefficient]] is close to that of tin glazes, thus avoid [[crazing]] during the firing process.&lt;ref&gt;Tite, M. S. 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravaglioli, A., A. Keajewski, M. S. Tite, R. R. Burn, P. A. Simpson, and G. C. Bojani. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the calcareous clay fired in an oxidising atmosphere results in a buff colour, thus lower the concentration of tin oxide used &lt;ref&gt;Tite, M. S., Freestone, I. and Manson, R.B., "Lead glazes in antiquity - methods of production and reasons for use", ''archaeometry'', 1998, 40:241-260&lt;/ref&gt;

The white opaque surface makes tin glaze a good base for painted decoration. The decoration is applied as metallic oxides, most commonly [[cobalt oxide]] for blue, [[Copper(II) oxide|copper oxide]] for green, [[iron oxide]] for brown, [[manganese dioxide]] for purple-brown and [[antimony]] for yellow.  Late Italian [[maiolica]] blended oxides to produce detailed and realistic polychrome paintings, called ''istoriato''. To these oxides modern potters are able to add powdered ceramic colours made from combinations of oxide, sometimes [[frit]]ted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pottersconnection.co.uk/shop/33/index.htm Potters Connection]&lt;/ref&gt; In the sixteenth century, the use of subtle and blended colours which were not strong enough to penetrate the opaque glaze made the delicate control of ton-value possible, and the painting therefore had to be done on the glaze surface, which then becomes a common manner of painting on tin-glazed wares.&lt;ref name=CaigerSmith73/&gt;

The pottery vessels are biscuit fired, usually between 900 ℃ and 1000 ℃. The fired vessel is dipped in a liquid glaze [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] which sticks to it, leaving a smooth and absorbent surface when dry. On this surface colours are applied by brush, the colours made from powered oxides mixed with water to a consistency of water-colour paint, sometimes with the addition of a binding agent such as [[gum arabic]].  The unfired glaze absorbs the pigment like [[fresco]], making errors difficult to correct but preserving the brilliant colors of the oxides when fired.  The glazed and decorated vessels are returned to the kiln for a second firing, usually between 1000 and 1120 ℃ (the higher temperatures used by modern potters). Lustered wares have a third firing at a lower temperature, necessitating a delicate control of the amount of oxygen in the kiln atmosphere and therefore a flame-burning kiln.

Traditional kilns were wood firing, which required the pots to be protected in the glaze and luster firings by [[saggar]]s or to be fired in a [[muffle]] kiln. Except for those making luster ware, modern tin-glaze potters use electric kilns.

The recrystallisation of tin oxide during the firing provides evidence of the slightly different methods of different production sites, as the crystal size, the distribution and the concentration may be influenced. For instance, the analysis of the 14th century Islamic tin glazes from eastern Spain indicates that these samples may be produced by non-fritting methods, as the heterogeneous distribution of tin oxides may be the remains of original grains of tin oxides.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 

The interaction between glaze and body also give clues to different handling and firing processes. As mentioned above, tin glaze suspension is applied to [[biscuit (pottery)|bisque or biscuit]] body made of calcareous clay with high content of [[calcium oxide]]. This could be inferred from the absence of trapped glaze bubbles. If it is applied to an unfired body, the [[calcium carbonate]] will decompose, generating [[carbon dioxide]], the releasing of which from the body to the glaze results in trapped bubbles in the glaze layers.

'''''Transcendental Wild Oats: A Chapter from an Unwritten Romance''''' is a prose [[satire]] written by [[Louisa May Alcott]], about her family's involvement with the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] community [[Fruitlands (transcendental center)|Fruitlands]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard Francis, ''Transcendental Utopias: Individual and Community at Brook Farm, Fruitlands, and Walden'', Ithaca, NY, Cornell University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1840s. The work was first published in a New York newspaper in 1873,&lt;ref&gt;''The Independent'', Vol. 25 No. 1307, 18 December 1873, pp. 1569-71.&lt;/ref&gt; and reprinted in 1874,&lt;ref&gt;''The Woman's Journal'', Vol. 5 No. 8, 21 February 1874.&lt;/ref&gt; 1876,&lt;ref&gt;''Silver Pitchers, Laurel Leaves: Original Poems, Stories, and Essays'', Boston, William Gill, 1876.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1915&lt;ref&gt;Clara Endicott, ed., ''Bronson Alcott's Fruitlands'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; and after.

In her account, Alcott provides the real people involved with thin pseudonymous disguises. Her father [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] is "Abel Lamb," while his partner and community co-founder [[Charles Lane (transcendentalist)|Charles Lane]] is "Timon Lion;" [[Abby May|Abigail May Alcott]], Louisa's mother and Bronson's wife, is "Sister Hope." Alcott depicts her father as dominated by his more forceful partner, and both men as feckless and impractical dreamers. The men of the community spend their time in pointless debates while Sister Hope works from dawn to dusk to maintain their existence. 

A crisis arises at harvest time, when the grain crop is threatened by an approaching storm. In Alcott's words, "About the time the grain was ready to house, some call of the [[Over-soul|Oversoul]] wafted all the men away."&lt;ref&gt;"Transcendental Wild Oats," 1915 edition, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Sister Hope organizes the only available help, three little girls and a boy, and manages to save the crop.

The little community collapses as soon as the weather turns cold, when it becomes clear that their provisions are too meager to last the coming winter. Timon Lion and his son abscond to join the [[Shakers]] &amp;mdash; though Timon is unhappy to learn that life among them is "all work and no play." Abel is crushed by the failure of the enterprise; after days of despair he begins to eat again only when he realizes that his family needs him. Sister Hope finds a way for them to subsist and persevere.&lt;ref&gt;Nan Bowman Albinski, "Utopia Reconsidered: Women Novelists and Nineteenth-Century Utopian Visions," ''Signs'', Vol. 13 No. 4 (Summer 1988); pp. 830-41; see pp. 837-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcott's view of male arrogance and female exploitation in this piece is paralleled in her novel ''[[Work: A Story of Experience|Work]]'', published in the same year as ''Transcendental Wild Oats''.

''Transcendental Wild Oats'' has been reprinted in several modern editions.&lt;ref&gt;Including: Louisa May Alcott, ''Transcendental Wild Oats: And Excerpts from the Fruitlands Diary'', Boston, Harvard Common Press, 1975; and: Joan M. Jensen, ed., ''With These Hands: Women Working on the Land'', New York, Feminist Press, 1980; pp. 49-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, he was convicted in [[New York City]] of one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.&lt;ref name=rfe/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E7DD1231F93BA35750C0A9619C8B63&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fU%2fUnited%20Nations%20 ''World Briefing | United Nations: Russian Ex-Diplomat Guilty In Bribe Case'', New York Times, March 8, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  In October of the same year, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 51 months and a fine of $73,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[ITAR-TASS]] October 12, 2007: [http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=11962892&amp;PageNum=0 Russian diplomat sentenced on money laundering charges]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuznetsov was indicted in September 2005 in Southern District of New York (1:05-cr-00916-DAB-1) following a guilty plea and immediate cooperation by the former UN official Alexander Yakovlev, who is facing 20 years in jail on a conspiracy to commit money laundering charge and has not been sentenced. Yakovlev's lawyer, Arkady Bukh, has stated that he expects Mr. Yakovlev's sentence to be significantly reduced in exchange for Yakovlev's testimony at trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kommersant.com/page.asp?id=620287 ''Russia’s U.N. Officer Waits for Sentence in Pledged House'', Kommersant]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Kuznetsov was elected to a three-year term on the budget advisory committee in January 2003. The prestigious panel’s 15 members, including a representative of the United States, then elected him as its chairman. He has worked in various budget-related positions in the U.N. Secretariat and the Russian Mission since 1980.

The chairman is the only member of the ACABQ to draw a U.N. salary and benefits, and also gets [[diplomatic immunity]]. Committee members are not UN employees and do not normally enjoy diplomatic immunity. But the General Assembly granted him immunity because of his chairmanship. This diplomatic immunity was waived however, in August, by the UN.

'''Yuri Ivanovitch Manin''' ({{lang-ru|Ю́рий Ива́нович Ма́нин}}; born 1937) is a Russian mathematician, known for work in [[algebraic geometry]] and [[diophantine geometry]], and many expository works ranging from [[mathematical logic]] to [[theoretical physics]]. Moreover, Manin was one of the first to propose the idea of a [[quantum computer]] in [[Timeline of quantum computing|1980]] with his book "Computable and Uncomputable".&lt;ref name="manin1980vychislimoe"&gt;{{cite book| author=Manin, Yu.

==Life and career==
Manin gained a doctorate in 1960 at the [[Steklov Mathematics Institute]] as a student of [[Igor Shafarevich]]. He is now a Professor at the [[Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik]] in [[Bonn]], and a professor [[emeritus]] at [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/99|title=Yuri Manin {{!}} Max Planck Institute for Mathematics|website=www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de|language=en|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.math.northwestern.edu/people/emeriti/ |title=Emeriti Faculty: Department of Mathematics - Northwestern University |website=www.math.northwestern.edu |language=en |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manin's early work included papers on the arithmetic and [[formal group]]s of [[abelian varieties]], the [[Mordell conjecture]] in the [[global function field|function field]] case, and [[algebraic differential equation]]s. The [[Gauss–Manin connection]] is a basic ingredient of the study of [[cohomology]] in families of [[algebraic varieties]]. He wrote a book on [[cubic surface]]s and [[cubic form]]s, showing how to apply both classical and contemporary methods of algebraic geometry, as well as [[nonassociative algebra]]. He also indicated the role of the [[Brauer group]], via [[Grothendieck]]'s theory of global [[Azumaya algebra]]s, in accounting for obstructions to the [[Hasse principle]], setting off a generation of further work. He also formulated the [[Manin conjecture]], which predicts the asymptotic behaviour of the number of rational points of bounded height on algebraic varieties. He has further written on [[Yang–Mills theory]], [[quantum information]], and [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]].

Manin had over 40 doctoral students, including [[Vladimir Berkovich]], [[Mariusz Wodzicki]], [[Alexander Beilinson]], [[Ivan Cherednik]], [[Alexei Skorobogatov]], [[Vladimir Drinfeld]], [[Mikhail Kapranov]], [[Vyacheslav Shokurov]], [[Arend Bayer]] and [[Victor Kolyvagin]], as well as foreign students including [[Hà Huy Khoái]], now the most senior mathematician in Vietnam.   He was awarded the [[Brouwer Medal]] in 1987, the [[Schock Prize]] in 1999 and the [[Cantor Medal]] in 2002.  In 1994, he was awarded the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]]. In 2010, he received the [[Bolyai Prize]] of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].

In 1990 he became foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/4514 |title=Y.I.
