The '''Namita Sunita murder incident''' (नमिता सुनिता हत्याकाण्ड) is a controversial, unsolved rape and murder of three girls that took place in 1980. Three girls, Namita Bhandari, Sunita Bhandari and Neera Parajuli, were raped and murdered in [[Pokhara]], [[Nepal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/world/other-world/demand-for-fresh-probe-into-nepal-triple-rape-murder-1.236080|title=Demand for fresh probe into Nepal triple rape, murder|publisher=Gulfnews.com|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="badname"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Day Pokhara Got a Bad Name. |url=http://beingnrb.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/the-day-pokhara-got-a-bad-name-namita-sunita-murder/ |accessdate=October 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108170854/http://beingnrb.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/the-day-pokhara-got-a-bad-name-namita-sunita-murder/ |archivedate=November 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Demands for fresh probe into Nepal murder case |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1033170541.html |accessdate=October 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328145532/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1033170541.html |archivedate=March 28, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nepalitimes.com/news.php?id=16066#.VD0Nb2eSyss|title=Lawlessness and disorder|publisher=Nepaltimes.com|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a single witness. The witness, Churamani Adhikari, later committed suicide as per the official report and the case went unsolved.

==Background==
In the summer of 1980, sisters Namita and Sunita Bhandari took a bus to [[Pokhara]] to spend their school holidays. Namita and Sunita, along with their relative Neera Parajuli from Bindhyaabasini visited the [[Seti]] river bank. There was a [[Nepalese Army|Nepal Army]] camp nearby on the east side of the Mahendra bridge. As the girls reached the river bank, a group of boys nearby started teasing them and turned hostile, then allegedly raped and murdered all three girls and disposed of their bodies in the Seti river.&lt;ref name="badname"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
In June 2001, [[King Birendra]] and his family were massacred and [[Gyanendra]] was sworn in as the new king. The case drew suspicion when police were asked to close the case just 10 days after his ascension. The case was closed inconclusively in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.webindia123.com/news/Articles/Asia/20060507/326828.html|title=Demands for fresh probe into Nepal murder case|publisher=News.webindia123.com|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can involve hatred, grievance, distrust, intimidation, fear, and hostility towards the Hungarian [[Hungarian diaspora|people]], [[Hungarian language|language]] and [[Culture of Hungary|culture]].

==History==
{{Undue weight section|date=August 2016}}
During the era of the Austro-Hungarian monarchs, the court in [[Vienna]] was influenced by Hungarophobia, but the Hungarian landowner nobles also showed signs of [[Germanophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hochedlinger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=U-LTw-cylfoC&amp;pg=PA25 Austria's Wars of Emergence: War, State and Society in the Habsburg Monarchy, 1683-1797], Pearson Education, 2003, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, after the end of [[Rákóczi's War of Independence]], many immigrants came to the underpopulated southern parts of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]: for instance, 800 new German villages were established.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Spira, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=aPGmTpDlLIS38gPi7KGsDw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=mMhnAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=800+german+villages+1780+Hungary&amp;q=800+#search_anchor German-Hungarian relations and the Swabian problem: from Károlyi to Gömbös, 1919-1936], East European quarterly, 1977, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities preferred non-Hungarian settlers.

The resettlement policy was characterized as anti-Hungarian,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jZvuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=habsburgok+magyarellenes+betelepitesek&amp;dq=habsburgok+magyarellenes+betelepitesek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BpLNUfKYCoiN7Qb864DQAQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg Hídfő könyvtár, Volume 8], Issue 1, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Istvàn Sisa, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=BpLNUfKYCoiN7Qb864DQAQ&amp;id=UgQiAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=habsburgok+magyarellenes+betelepitesek&amp;q=politika#search_anchor Magyarságtükör: nemzet határok nélkül], Püski, 2001, p. 99 Cited: "Magyarellenes betelepítési politika.

The Habsburgs and their advisers skilfully manipulated the Croatian, Serbian and Romanian peasantry, led by priests and officers firmly loyal to the Habsburgs, and they induced them to rebel against the Hungarian government. The Austrians had encouraged the [[Galician slaughter|Galician uprising]] to decimate Polish insurgent nobles.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Thousands of Hungarians were [[1848–1849 massacres in Transylvania|massacred in Transylvania in 1848-49]] (now part of [[Romania]]) in nine separate incidents during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]].

===Czechoslovakia===
Minorities in Czechoslovakia in 1918 to 1939 enjoyed personal freedoms and were properly recognized by the state. There were three Hungarian and/or Hungarian-centric political parties:
* [[Hungarian-German Social Democratic Party]]
* [[Hungarian National Party]]
* [[Provincial Christian-Socialist Party]]

In Slovakia, Hungarian and pro-Hungarian political parties are a stable part of the political system. Anti-Hungarian sentiment had been criticized particularly during the third government of [[Vladimír Mečiar]]. In the past, so-called "Hungarian card" had been used mainly by the [[Slovak National Party]] (SNS)&lt;ref name="Sharipol"/&gt; against the granting of a special status to the Hungarian minority; it argued for the complete assimilation of the Hungarian minority into Slovak society.{{Verify source|date=August 2016}} It considers that Hungarians in Slovakia are actually overprivileged.&lt;ref name="Sharipol"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Politics Without a Past: The Absence of History in Postcommunist Nationalism|last=Cohen |first= Shari J.|authorlink= |year= 2009|publisher=Duke University Press, Nov 22, 1999|location=|ref= |isbn=0822323990 |page= |pages= 140 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HHRF&gt;[http://www.hhrf.org/hhrf/index_en.php?oldal=182 Hungarian Human Rights Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105110629/http://www.hhrf.org/hhrf/index_en.php?oldal=182 |date=2011-01-05 }} New Slovak Government Embraces Ultra-Nationalists, Excludes Hungarian Coalition Party&lt;/ref&gt; After personnel changes in the presidium, SNS abandoned similar rhetoric and formed a common government with pro-Hungarian [[Most-Híd]] in 2016.

Anti-Hungarian rhetoric of some far-right organizations in Slovakia is based on historical stereotypes and conflicts in the common history as interpreted from nationalistic positions and recent events. In such interpretations, the arrival of old Hungarian tribes is described as the occupation by barbarian tribes and contributed to the destruction of [[Great Moravia]]. Other negative sentiments are related to the period of [[Magyarization]], the policy of interwar Hungary, the collaboration of Hungarian-minority parties with the Hungarian government against Czechoslovakia, the [[First Vienna Award]] and the [[Slovak–Hungarian War]].&lt;ref name="danilov-nociar"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Milovaní a nenávidení: Podobnosti a rozdiely medzi slovenskou a maďarskou krajnou pravicou |trans-title=Loved and hated: Similarities and differences between Slovak and Hungarian far-right |editor1-last=Danilov |editor1-first=Sergej |editor2-last=Nociar |editor2-first=Tomáš |year= 2012 | publisher=Inštitút pre medzikultúrny dialóg | location=Bratislava |ref= | isbn=978-80-970915-0-7 |pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hungary is accused of still trying to undermine the territorial integrity of Slovakia, and local minority politicians are accused of [[irredentism]].&lt;ref name="danilov-nociar"/&gt; However, anti-Hungarian sentiment is not typical even for all far-right organisations, and the leader of the [[Slovak Brotherhood]] emphasized the need for collaboration with Hungarian far-right organisations against [[materialism]] and [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref name="danilov-nociar"/&gt;

Women, Slovak or not, used to be required to affix the Slovak feminine marker ''-ová'' (used for [[declension]] of feminine names) at the end of their surname.&lt;ref name="BRND"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Minority rights in Central and Eastern Europe |last=Bernd |first= Rechel|authorlink= |year= 2009|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|location=|ref= |isbn=0415590310|page= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One incident of ethnically-motivated violence against Hungarians in Slovakia is the [[Hedvig Malina]] case. The 23-year-old Hungarian student from [[Horné Mýto]] was allegedly beaten and robbed in [[Nitra]] after speaking [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] in public.&lt;ref name=BP&gt;{{cite web|title=Malina case bungled: Prosecutor|publisher=''The Budapest Times''|url=http://www.budapesttimes.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=635&amp;Itemid=27|accessdate=2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "higherjustice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maligned Hungarian seeks higher justice|publisher=''The Budapest Times'' |url=http://www.budapesttimes.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3070&amp;Itemid=26 |date=2007-12-10|accessdate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.lepetitjournal.com/content/view/8350/956/ | language = French | title = Une étudiante met le feu aux poudres ("A student sets fire to the powder") | publisher = lepetitjournal.com | date = 2006-09-18 | accessdate = 2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A football match in [[Dunajská Streda]] also caused tensions between Slovakia and Hungary when Hungarian fans were badly beaten by the Slovak police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/33498/2/football_riot_stokes_tension.html |title=Football riot stokes tension |publisher=spectator.sme.sk |accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority and the Hungarian minority describe their coexistence mostly as good.

The '''Bambara''' (Bamana) language, '''''Bamanankan''''', is a [[lingua franca]] and [[national language]] of [[Mali]] spoken by perhaps 15 million people, natively by 5 million [[Bambara people]] and about 10 million [[Second language|second-language]] users. It is estimated that about 80 percent of the population of Mali speak Bambara as a first or second language. It has a [[subject–object–verb]] clause structure and two lexical [[tone (tonal language)|tone]]s.

==Classification==
Bambara is a variety of a group of closely related languages called [[Manding languages|Manding]], whose native speakers trace their cultural history to the medieval [[Mali Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mandelang.kunstkamera.ru/files/mandelang/mandekan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408104148/http://mandelang.kunstkamera.ru/files/mandelang/mandekan.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Varieties of Manding are generally considered (among native speakers) to be mutually intelligible &amp;ndash; dependent on exposure or familiarity with dialects between speakers &amp;ndash; and spoken by 30 to 40 million people in the countries [[Burkina Faso]], [[Senegal]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Guinea]], [[Liberia]], [[Ivory Coast]] and [[the Gambia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/SILESR/2000/2000-003/Manding/Manding.htm|title=Mandé Language Family: Manding|website=www.sil.org|accessdate=1 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121102940/http://www.sil.org/SILESR/2000/2000-003/Manding/Manding.htm|archivedate=21 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manding is part of the larger [[Mande languages|Mandé]] family of languages.

==Alphabet and literature==
It uses seven vowels a, e, ɛ, i, o, ɔ and u, each of which can be nasalized, pharyngealized and murmured, giving a total number of 21 vowels (the letters approximate their [[help:IPA|IPA]] equivalents). {{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
Writing with the latin alphabet began during the [[French West Africa|French]] occupation, and the first orthography was introduced in 1967. Literacy is limited, especially in rural areas. Although written literature is only slowly evolving (due to the predominance of French as the "language of the educated"), there exists a wealth of [[oral history|oral literature]], which is often tales of kings and heroes. This oral literature is mainly tradited by the [[griot]]s (''Jeliw'' in Bambara) who are a mixture of [[storytelling|storyteller]]s, praise singers, and human history books who have studied the trade of singing and reciting for many years. Many of their songs are very old and are said to date back to the old empire of Mali.

==Geographical distribution==
Bambara is spoken throughout Mali as a lingua franca. The language is most widely spoken in the areas east, south, and north of Bamako, where native speakers and/or those that identify as members of the Bambara ethnic group are most densely populated. These regions are also usually considered to be the historical geographical origin of Bambara people, particularly [[Ségou]], after diverging from other Manding groups.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/SILESR/2000/2000-003/Manding/Bamana.htm|title=Mandé Language Family: Maps of Manding-East, North-Eastern Manding, Bamana, Urban  koine|website=www.sil.org|accessdate=1 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122172907/http://www.sil.org/SILESR/2000/2000-003/Manding/Bamana.htm|archivedate=22 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
The main dialect is Standard Bamara, which has significant influence from Maninkakan.{{clarify|date=August 2015}} Bambara has many local dialects: Kaarta, Tambacounda (west); Beledugu, Bananba, Mesekele (north); Jitumu, Jamaladugu, Segu (center); Cakadugu, Keleyadugu, Jalakadougu, Kurulamini, Banimɔncɛ, Cɛmala, Cɛndugu, Baninkɔ, Shɛndugu, Ganadugu (south); Kala, Kuruma, Saro, dialects to the northeast of Mopti (especially Bɔrɛ); Zegedugu, Bɛndugu, Bakɔkan, Jɔnka (southeast).,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vydrine 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
Since 1967, Bambara has mostly been written in the [[Latin script]], using [[African reference alphabet|some additional phonetic characters]]. The vowels are ''a, e, [[ɛ]]'' (formerly ''[[è]]''&lt;span style="margin-left:3px"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, ''i, o, [[ɔ]]'' (formerly ''[[ò]]''&lt;span style="margin-left:3px"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, ''u''&lt;span style="margin-left:2px"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; accents can be used to indicate tonality. The former digraph ''ny'' is now written ''[[ɲ]]'' when it designates a palatal nasal glide; the ''ny'' spelling is kept for the combination of a nasal vowel with a subsequent oral palatal glide. Following the 1966 Bamako spelling conventions, a nasal velar glide "[[ŋ]]" is written as "[[ŋ]]", although in early publications it was often transcribed as ''ng'' or ''nk''.

The [[N'Ko script|N'Ko]] ({{script|Nkoo|ߒߞߏ}}) alphabet is a script devised by [[Solomana Kante]] in 1949 as a writing system for the Manding languages of West Africa; N’Ko means 'I say' in all Manding languages. Kante created N’Ko in response to what he felt were beliefs that Africans were a "cultureless people" since prior to this time there had been no indigenous African writing system for his language. N'ko came first into use in Kankan, Guinea as a Maninka alphabet and disseminated from there into other Manding-speaking parts of West Africa. N'ko and the [[Arabic script]] are still in use for Bambara, although the Latin script is much more common.

Each consonant represents a single sound. Although, there are some exceptions:
* "W" is pronounced as in English (e.g. wait), but placed at the end of a word, "w" is the plural mark and is pronounced as [u]
* "S" is pronounced most often as in the English word "see", but sometimes it can be pronounced as "sh" (in phonetic alphabet [ʃ]) as in the word "shoe", or again as [z]
* "G" is pronounced most often as in the English word "go", but within a word it can be pronounced as in the Spanish word "abogado" (in phonetic alphabet [ɣ]), and sometimes at the beginning [gw]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cours pratique de bambara|last=Bailleul|first=Charles|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
Like Turkish and Japanese, it is an agglutinative language, meaning that morphemes are glued together to form a word.

The basic sentence structure is Subject Object Verb.  Take the phrase, "n t'a don" (I don't know [it]). "n" is the subject (me), "a" is the object (it), and "[ka] don" is the verb ([to] know). The "t'" is from the present tense marker "té." "té" is the negative present tense marker and "bé" is the affirmative present tense marker. Therefore, "n b'a don" would mean "I know it".

Bambara is an [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] language and has two (mid/standard and high) [[tone (tonal language)|tone]]s; e.g. ''sa'' 'die' vs. ''sá'' 'snake.' The typical argument structure of the language consists of a subject, followed by an aspectival auxiliary, followed by the direct object, and finally a transitive verb.  Naturally, if the verb is intransitive, the direct object is absent.

Bambara does not inflect for gender. Gender for a noun can be specified by adding an adjective, ''-cɛ'' or ''-kɛ'' for male and ''-muso'' for female. The plural is formed by attaching a vocalic suffix ''-u'', most often with a low tone (in the orthography, ''-w'') to nouns or adjectives.

Bambara uses postpositions in much the same manner as languages like English and French use prepositions. These postpositions are found after the verb and are used to express direction, location, and in some cases, possession.

===Loan words===
In urban areas, many Bambara conjunctions have been replaced in everyday use by French borrowings that often mark code-switches. The [[Bamako]] dialect makes use of sentences like: ''N taara Kita mais il n'y avait personne là-bas.'' : ''I went to Kita [Bambara] but there was no one there [French].'' The sentence in Bambara alone would be ''N taara Kita nka mɔgɔsi tuntɛ yen.'' The French proposition "est-ce que" is also used in Bambara; however, it is pronounced more slowly and as three syllables, {{IPA|[ɛsəkə]}}.

Bambara uses many French loan words. For example, some people might say:
''I ka kulosi ye jauni ye'': "Your skirt is yellow" (using a derivation of the French word for yellow, jaune.)

However, one could also say:
''I ka kulosi ye neremuguman ye'', also meaning "your skirt is yellow." The original Bambara word for yellow comes from "''neremugu''," being flour (''mugu'') made from [[Parkia biglobosa|néré]] (locust bean), a seed from a long seed pod. Neremugu is often used in sauces in Southern Mali.

Most French loan words are suffixed with the sound 'i'; this is particularly common when using French words which have a meaning not traditionally found in Mali. For example, the Bambara word for [[snow]] is ''niegei'', based on the French word for snow ''neige''. As there has never been snow in Mali, there was no unique word in Bambara to describe it.

===Examples===
:''N bɛ bamanankan mɛn dɔɔni-dɔɔni''
:I understand/hear a little bit of Bambara (lit: I ''aux positive'' Bambara hear small-small)

:''I tɛna dumuni ke wa?''
:Aren't you going to eat? (lit: you ''aux negative future'' eating do ''question particle'')

:''Du Mara be ameriki hali bi wa?''
:Is Dou Mara still living in the USA? (lit: Dou Mara still America in live ''question particle'')

==Music==
Malian artists such as [[Oumou Sangaré]], [[Sidiki Diabaté]], [[Rokia Traoré]], [[Ali Farka Touré]], [[Salif Keita]], [[Habib Koité]], and the married duo [[Amadou &amp; Mariam]] often sing in Bambara.  Aïda of the band [[Métisse (band)|Métisse]] often sings in [[Dyula language|Dioula]], as does [[Mory Kante]], born in Guinea to a Malian mother; his most famous song to date is "Yeke Yeke" ([[Alpha Blondy]]).  Lyrics in Bambara occur on [[Stevie Wonder]]'s soundtrack ''[[Journey through the Secret Life of Plants]]''.
[[Tiken Jah Fakoly]] (reggae) often sings in Dioula and French.

Additionally, in 2010, [[Spain|Spanish]] rock group [[Dover (band)|Dover]] released its 7th studio album [[I Ka Kené]], with the majority of lyrics in the language. American rapper [[Nas]] also released a track titled "Sabali" in 2010, which featured [[Damian Marley]]. ''Sabali'' is a Bambara word that means patience.

==Legal status==
Bambara is one of several languages designated by Mali as a [[national language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Skattum |first=Ingse |date=2010 |title=L'introduction des langues nationales dans le système éducatif au Mali: objectifs et conséquences |trans-title=The Introduction of National Languages to the Malian Educational System: Problems and Consequences |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/docserver/19552629/3/1/19552629_003_01_S013_text.pdf?expires=1487354096&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=2A729881414DED33D000C3984B49D9E3 |language=French |journal=Journal of Language Contact |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=248 |doi=10.1163/19552629-90000013 |access-date=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Big Brother''' is a fictional character and symbol in [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.

He is ostensibly the leader of [[Oceania (1984)|Oceania]], a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state wherein the ruling party [[Ingsoc]] wields total power "for its own sake" over the inhabitants. In the society that Orwell describes, every citizen is under constant [[surveillance]] by the authorities, mainly by [[telescreen]]s (with the exception of the [[Proles]]). The people are constantly reminded of this by the slogan "Big Brother is watching you": a maxim that is ubiquitously on display.

In modern culture, the term "Big Brother" has entered the [[lexicon]] as a synonym for abuse of government power, particularly in respect to [[civil liberties]], often specifically related to [[mass surveillance]].

== Purported origins ==
In the essay section of his novel ''[[1985 (Anthony Burgess novel)|1985]]'', [[Anthony Burgess]] states that Orwell got the idea for the name of Big Brother from advertising [[billboard]]s for educational [[correspondence course]]s from a company called Bennett's during [[World War II]]. The original posters showed [[J. M. Bennett]] himself, a kindly-looking old man offering guidance and support to would-be students with the phrase "Let me be attached. According to Burgess, after Bennett's death, his son took over the company and the posters were replaced with pictures of the son (who looked imposing and stern in contrast to his father's kindly demeanor) with the text "Let me be your big brother".

Additional speculation from [[Douglas Kellner]] of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] argued that Big Brother represents [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/index.html |title=Douglas Kellner, George F. Kneller Philosophy of Education Chair, UCLA |work=ucla.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709224448/http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/index.html |archivedate=9 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/essays/from1984toonedimensional.pdf|title=From 1984 to One-Dimensional Man: Critical Reflections on Orwell and Marcuse|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829021052/http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/essays/from1984toonedimensional.pdf|archivedate=29 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that the inspiration for Big Brother was [[Brendan Bracken]], the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Minister of Information]] until 1945. Orwell worked under Bracken on the [[BBC]]'s Indian Service. Bracken was customarily referred to by his employees by his initials, B.B., the same initials as the character Big Brother. Orwell also resented the wartime censorship and need to manipulate information which he felt came from the highest levels of the Minister of Information and from Bracken's office in particular.

== Appearance inside the novel ==
=== Existence ===
[[File:Telescreen.png|thumb|250px|Big Brother's face looms from giant telescreens in Victory Square]]
In the novel, it is never made clear whether Big Brother is or had been a real person, or is a [[National personification|fictional personification]] of [[Ingsoc|the Party]], similar to [[Britannia]] and [[Uncle Sam]]. Big Brother is described as appearing on posters and telescreens as a man in his mid-40s. In Party propaganda, Big Brother is presented as one of the founders of the Party, along with [[Emmanuel Goldstein|Goldstein]].

At one point, [[Winston Smith]], the protagonist of Orwell's novel, tries "to remember in what year he had first heard mention of Big Brother. He thought it must have been at some time in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. In the Party histories, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of the Revolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London".

In the book ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'', read by Winston Smith and purportedly written by Goldstein, Big Brother is referred to as infallible and all-powerful. No one has ever seen him and there is a reasonable certainty that he will never die. He is simply "the guise in which the Party chooses to exhibit itself to the world" since the emotions of love, fear and reverence are more easily focused on an individual (if only a face on the hoardings and a voice on the telescreens) than an organisation. When Winston Smith is later arrested, [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]] repeats that Big Brother will never die. When Smith asks if Big Brother exists, O'Brien describes him as "the embodiment of the Party" and says that he will exist as long as the Party exists. When Winston asks "Does Big Brother exist the same way I do?" (meaning is Big Brother an actual human being), O'Brien replies "You do not exist" (meaning that Smith is now an [[unperson]]; an example of [[doublethink]]).

=== Cult of personality ===
A spontaneous ritual of devotion to Big Brother ("BB") is illustrated at the end of the "[[Two Minutes Hate]]": {{quote|At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow, rhythmic chant of 'B-B! . . . B-B! . . . B-B!'—over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first 'B' and the second—a heavy murmurous sound, somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamps of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms.  For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up.  It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion.  Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George (1949). Nineteen Eighty-Four.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though Oceania's [[Ministry of Truth]], [[Ministry of Plenty]] and [[Ministry of Peace]] each have names with meanings deliberately opposite to their real purpose, the [[Ministry of Love]] is perhaps the most straightforward as "rehabilitated thought criminals" leave the Ministry as loyal subjects who have been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] into adoring (loving) Big Brother, hence its name.

=== Big Brother salute ===
Like the [[Nazi salute]], Ingsoc has its own salute to Big Brother, which consists of crossing one's arms above the head during [[Two Minutes Hate]]s and [[Hate week]]s, showing loyalty to Big Brother and the Party. Note that it is only mentioned and shown in the movie adaptation of the novel.

== Legacy ==
{{Global surveillance}}
[[File:Plaza George Orwell, Barcelona..jpg|thumb|left|[[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] in [[George Orwell]] Square in [[Barcelona]], Spain]]
Since the publication of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', the phrase "Big Brother" has come into common use to describe any prying or overly-controlling authority figure and attempts by government to increase surveillance. Big Brother and other [[Orwellian]] imagery are often referenced in the joke known as the [[Russian reversal]].

The magazine ''Book'' ranked Big Brother No. 59 on its 100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900 list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christine Paik |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/totn/features/2002/mar/020319.characters.html |title=100 Best Fictional Characters Since 1900 |publisher=NPR |date=19 March 2002 |accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine rated him the 75th greatest villain of all time.&lt;ref&gt;''Wizard'' #177&lt;/ref&gt;

The worldwide reality television show ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' is based on the novel's concept of people being under constant [[surveillance]]. In 2000, after the [[Big Brother (U.S. TV series)|United States version]] of the [[CBS]] program ''Big Brother'' premiered, the Estate of George Orwell sued CBS and its production company Orwell Productions, Inc. in federal court in Chicago for copyright and trademark infringement. The case was ''Estate of Orwell v. CBS'', 00-c-5034 (ND Ill). On the eve of trial, the case settled worldwide to the parties' "mutual satisfaction", but the amount that CBS paid to the Orwell Estate was not disclosed. CBS had not asked the Estate for permission. Under current laws, the novel will remain under [[copyright]] protection until 2020 in the European Union and until 2044 in the United States.

The iconic image of Big Brother (played by David Graham) played a key role in [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s "[[1984 (advertisement)|1984]]" television commercial introducing the [[Macintosh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/news/remembering-the-1984-super-bowl-mac-ad/263647 Remembering the '1984' Super Bowl Mac ad] ZDNet, 23 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/technology/2009/09/iconic_apple_ad_gets_doubletwi.html Apple's 'Big Brother' sequel] BBC News, 30 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Orwell Estate viewed the Apple commercial as a copyright infringement and sent a cease-and-desist letter to Apple and its advertising agency. The commercial was never televised again,&lt;ref&gt;William R. Coulson [http://www.dartmouthlawjournal.org/articles/106-115.pdf ‘Big Brother’ is watching Apple: The truth about the Super Bowl's most famous ad] The Dartmouth Law Journal, 25 June 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220353/http://www.dartmouthlawjournal.org/articles/106-115.pdf |date=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the date mentioned in the ad (24 January) was but two days later, making it unlikely that it would have been re-aired. Subsequent (now posthumous) ads featuring [[Steve Jobs]] (for a variety of products including audio books) have mimicked the format and appearance of that original ad campaign, with the appearance of Jobs nearly identical to that of Big Brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nick |last= Farrell |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1558044/steve-jobs-big-brother |title=Steven Jobs is the new Big Brother |publisher= the Inquirer |date=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last= Gianatasio |url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/steve-jobs-once-again-cast-big-brother-11810 |title=Steve Jobs (once again) cast as Big Brother |publisher= AdWeek |date=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' spoofed Apple's Big Brother commercial in an episode entitled "[[MyPods and Boomsticks|Mypods and Boomsticks]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=MG |last= Siegler |url=https://venturebeat.com/2008/12/01/the-simpsons-apple-spoof-likely-has-many-wondering-what-a-mycube-is/ |title=The Simpsons Apple spoof likely has many wondering what a "myCube" is |publisher= VentureBeat |date=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer company [[Microsoft]] patented in 2011 a product distribution system with a camera or capture device that monitors the viewers that consume the product, allowing the provider to take "remedial action" if the actual viewers do not match the distribution license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220120278904%22.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20120278904&amp;RS=DN/20120278904 |title=Content distribution regulation by viewing use |publisher=Appft.uspto.gov |date= |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kinect|system]] has been compared with ''1984'''s telescreen surveillance system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Robert |last=Evans |url=http://www.i4u.com/42421/kinect-makes-i1984i-reality |title=Kinect Makes 1984 Reality: Well, one part anyway |publisher=I4u.com |date=12 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6C2DUhIdV?url=http://www.i4u.com/42421/kinect-makes-i1984i-reality |archivedate=9 November 2012 |df=dmy }} .&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of laws intended to implement the European Union [[Data Retention Directive]] in [[Romania]] were nicknamed "the Big Brother laws" by Romanian media and civil society as they would have led to blanket storage of citizens' telecommunications data for six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://economie.hotnews.ro/stiri-telecom-12503594-traian-basescu-promulgat-asa-numita-39-lege-big-brother-39-care-prevede-stocarea-pentru-sase-luni-datelor-trafic-ale-tuturor-utilizatorilor-telefonie-internet.htm |title=Traian Basescu a promulgat asa numita 'lege Big Brother' care prevede stocarea pentru sase luni a datelor de trafic ale tuturor utilizatorilor de telefonie si internet }}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these laws were struck down as unconstitutional by the [[Constitutional Court of Romania]] and the Directive itself was ultimately invalidated by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]].

In the 2010 game ''[[Bioshock 2]]'', there is an enemy named the Big Sister.

'''Board certification''' is the process by which a [[physician]] or other professional demonstrates a mastery of basic knowledge and skills through written, practical, or simulator-based testing.

==Certification bodies==
There are 24 boards that certify physician specialists in the United States and there is no legal requirement to attain it. Some hospitals may demand that physicians must be board certified to get privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Gynecology’s Gender Question |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/health/gynecologys-gender-question.html?ref=science |quote=The gynecology board is one of 24 boards that certify medical specialists in the United States, based on training, exams and other requirements. Certification is voluntary and not required by law, but in practice it is essential, because most hospitals and insurers require it and patients are increasingly encouraged to choose only specialists who are certified. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 23, 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commonly used acronym BE/BC (board eligible/board certified) refers to a doctor who is eligible or is certified to practice medicine in a particular field.

The term ''board certified'' is also used in the [[nursing]] field, where a candidate with advanced mastery of a [[List of Nursing Specialties|nursing specialty]] can also become eligible to be [[Nursing board certification|Board Certified]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nursingcertification.org/|title=ABNS - Home|author=|date=|website=www.nursingcertification.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Board certification is also used in the field of pharmacy, where a [[Pharmacist#Specialization and credentialing|pharmacist]] can be recognized in specialized areas of advanced pharmacy practice after fulfilling eligibility requirements and passing a certification examination by the Board of Pharmacy Specialties&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpsweb.org/|title=Board of Pharmacy Specialties Homepage|author=|date=|website=Board of Pharmacy Specialties}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the National Board of Medication Therapy Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbmtm.org/|title=National Board of Medication Therapy Management Homepage|author=|date=|website=National Board of Medication Therapy Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctoral level psychologists ([[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], or [[Doctor of Psychology|Psy.D.]]) may also be board certified by the [[American Board of Professional Psychology]], or the [[American Board of Professional Neuropsychology]] or the American Board of Pediatric Neuropsychology.  

The [[FDA]] encourages board certification of all toxicologists who work in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, especially of those who oversee preclinical product safety studies.  The American Board of Toxicology is the oldest and largest certification body in the world to ensure the competency of toxicologists involved in preclinical drug discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.yrtph.2016.09.017 |pmid=27647630 |title=A practice analysis of toxicology |journal=Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology |volume=82 |pages=140–146 |year=2016 |last1=Wood |first1=Carol S. |last2=Weis |first2=Christopher P. |last3=Caro |first3=Carla M. |last4=Roe |first4=Amy }}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Board certification is available to a licensed [[lawyer|attorney]] ([[Juris Doctor|J.D.]]) in the United States as well, although it generally is not considered a form of licensure and usually does not confer additional privileges of any kind. Many state bar associations, including Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas, offer board certification in various specialty areas, such as admiralty law, civil trial law, estate planning (or wills, trusts, and estates) law, family (and/or marital) law, immigration law, and tax law. Other organizations also offer certification, with some being accredited by the [[American Bar Association]]. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Specialization offers extensive resources to attorneys and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/committees_commissions/specialization.html|title=Standing Committee on Specialization - Standing Committee / Specialization|author=|date=|website=www.americanbar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one state allows board certified attorneys to use an acronym similar to board certified doctors: [[The Florida Bar]] allows its certified attorneys to use the acronym B.C.S. to identify themselves as a "Board Certified Specialist" and prohibits attorneys not holding board certification from identifying themselves as "experts" or "specialists" (though a non-certified attorney may advertise that he or she "specializes" in one or more areas).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.floridabar.org/TFB/TFBResources.nsf/Attachments/53249E61C0B0107A85256F73005424F0/$FILE/Board%20Certification%20Q%20&amp;%20A.pdf?OpenElement (Accessed May 15, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining a medical specialty==
The core body of knowledge that defines an area of [[Specialty (medicine)|medical specialization]] is referred to as the core competencies for that specialty. Core competencies are developed through detailed review of the medical literature combined with review by recognized experts from established medical specialties, experts within the new area of specialization and experts from outside the medical profession. This list of core knowledge and skills is then compiled into a draft [[core competency]] document.

Once the core competency document is drafted, the certifying organization and its associated professional academy, college or society review the document against the existing literature and again solicit expert opinion regarding the domains of competence and areas of competency contained in the document. The core competencies are next formatted using a psychometric taxonomy such as [[Bloom's Taxonomy]] based on the core competencies required by physicians practicing in the area of specialization as non-specialists and as specialists or sub-specialists. Development of the first core competency document takes five to ten years and is a prerequisite to creating the certification examination.

==Certification examinations==
Physicians seeking board certification in a given area of specialty must successfully complete and pass an examination process designed to test their mastery of the minimum knowledge and skills contained in the core competency document. Prior to taking the examination, a physician must graduate with a degree, either MD, DO or DPM and meet all other prerequisites to certification as set out by the certifying agency or "board."

The examination itself may consist of one or more parts. Traditionally, an exhaustive written examination is required of all candidates for board certifications in any specialty. While written examinations are adequate measures of basic knowledge, they do not test the mastery of skills or the application of knowledge as well. Many specialties have over the decades attempted to evaluate skills through "practical" examinations using "model" patients (actors) or by observing the physician candidate in a clinical environment. The practical examination has been criticized for being subjective and irreproducible even in the hands of an experienced examiner. As a result, computerized [[animatronic]] [[virtual patient|human patient simulator]] based examinations are now being adopted. The traditional written examination is also rapidly being replaced by [[computer-based testing]].

The certification application and examination process for physicians is similar to the process for attorneys. Most state bar associations and organizations approved by the American Bar Association to certify attorneys in a particular area of law generally require five or more years of practice in that area, a minimum number of continuing legal education credits in that area, and references from peer attorneys, judges, or others qualified to comment on the attorney applicant's certification candidacy. Examinations vary, but many utilize multiple choice and essay questions to test the attorney's substantive knowledge and experience. For example, the Texas Board of Legal Specialization generally administers a six-hour examination consisting of three hours of essay questions in the morning and three hours of multiple choice questions in the afternoon, although the format varies based on the area of specialty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbls.org/Cert/AttyExamSpecs.aspx|title=TBLS Attorney Exam Specifications|author=|date=|website=www.tbls.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certifying agencies for physicians==
Board certification is overseen by different agencies and organizations throughout the world. In most cases, these organizations are not only specific to a particular type of physician training (MD vs. DO), but a specific country or group of countries. There are three agencies or organizations in the United States which collectively oversee the certification of [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.s]] and [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.s]] in the 26 recognized medical specialties. These organizations are the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] (ABMS) and the [[American Medical Association]]; the [[American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists]] (AOABOS) and the [[American Osteopathic Association]]; the [[American Board of Physician Specialties]] (ABPS) and the [[American Association of Physician Specialists]]. AOABOS and ABPS each have associated with associated national medical organization functions as an umbrella for its various specialty academies, colleges and societies (see table). The American Board of Medical Specialties represents the largest of these organizations, with over 800,000 US physicians having received certification from one or more of its 24-member Boards. The ABMS is not affiliated with any medical society. ABPS is recognized by most states, however, there are some states where physicians are not, by law, allowed to call themselves "board certified" if the specialty designation is from their boards.&lt;ref&gt;American Association of Physician Specialists, Inc. v. Brian J. Wing et al. No. 06 civ. 14253-WGY. United States District Court, Southern District of New York. 17 Sept. 09. http://docwhisperer.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/aaps-nysdoh-decision.pdf (Accessed October 11, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many boards of certification now require that physicians demonstrate, by examination, continuing mastery of the core knowledge and skills for their chosen specialty. Recertification varies by specialty between every 7 and every 10 years.

==Certifying agencies for attorneys==
Most state bar associations restrict their licensed attorneys from advertising that they are certified, experts, or specialists in a particular area of law unless they are either (a) certified by the state bar association or (b) certified by an organization approved by the American Bar Association. This approach generally follows Rule 7.4 of the [[ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct|American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct]].&lt;ref name="ABA 7.4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_7_4_communication_of_fields_of_practice_specialization.html |title=Rule 7.4: Communication of Fields of Practice &amp; Specialization |work=ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct |publisher=American Bar Association |accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Specialization lists specialty certification programs, including state bar associations and the specialty areas offered for certification purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/committees_commissions/specialization/resources/resources_for_lawyers/sources_of_certification.html|title=Sources of Certification - Division for Legal Services|author=|date=|website=www.americanbar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABA Model Rule 7.4(b) specifically allows [[patent attorney]]s to advertise their specialty, and Rule 7.4(c) allows [[United States admiralty law|admiralty]] lawyers to do so.&lt;ref name="ABA 7.4"/&gt; In the case of patent attorneys, admission to practice before the patent division of the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] requires that the attorney pass a [[USPTO registration examination|federally administered examination]].

==Specialty colleges==
{{See also|List of medical specialty colleges in the United States}}
Medical specialty colleges are societies that represent specialist physicians. Any physician may join these organizations, though most require board certification in order to become a fellow of the college and use the respective [[post-nominal letters]]. Similarly, legal specialty colleges are societies that represent specialist lawyers. Fellows of a particular legal specialty college might or might not be board certified. The [[American College of Trust and Estate Counsel]], which was originally known as the American College of Probate Counsel, is one of the oldest legal specialty colleges, although the [[American College of Trial Lawyers]] was founded a year later (1950).

==Criticism==

While medical licensing in general [[Medical license#Criticism|has been criticized]], the board certification process itself has generated a number of controversies and debates. Since many certification boards have begun requiring periodic re-examination, critics in newspapers such as ''The New York Times'' have decried board certification exams as being "its own industry", costing doctors thousands of dollars each time and serving to enrich testing and prep companies rather than improving the quality of the profession.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/16/opinion/board-certification-has-gone-too-far.html|title=Opinion - Stop Wasting Doctors' Time|date=15 December 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|via=NYTimes.com|last1=Ofri|first1=Danielle}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some also have reported that testing has evolved into a more generalized examination, where a significant portion of the test isn't relevant to the specialty a given doctor practices, and thus passing rates are much lower.

In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] there is a significant community of [[China|Chinese]] migrants located in the capital of [[Kinshasa]] and the mineral rich southern province of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]]. According to official figures from the Chinese embassy, there are 4,000 to 5,000 Chinese living in the DRC but this is considered an underestimate.&lt;ref name=shops&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalis in Soweto and Nairobi, Chinese in Congo and Zambia, local anger in Africa targets foreigners|url=http://mgafrica.com/article/2015-01-25-somalis-in-s-africa-chinese-in-dr-congo-and-zambia-anti-state-rage-in-africa-targets-foreigners/|agency=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Business==
Business links, both by individual entrepreneurs and state owned enterprises, has brought Chinese migration to the DRC. 

The first wave of migrants were individuals who opened stores, restaurants, and private medical clinics.&lt;ref name=morningpost&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese migrants thrive in the Congo, world's poorest nation|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1321910/chinese-migrants-thrive-congo-worlds-poorest-nation|agency=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese run stores in Kinshasa are typically scattered across neighborhoods and are not concentrated in any [[Chinatown]].&lt;ref name=storeowner&gt;{{cite news|title=The Chinese in Africa: Meet Mr. Chen|url=http://www.chinaafricaproject.com/chinese-merchants-kinshasa-africa-congo/|publisher=The China Africa Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stores carry a range of household goods and change money.&lt;ref name=storeowner/&gt; The owner eekes out a small profit albeit one still higher than what is earned by neighborhood stores in China.&lt;ref name=storeowner/&gt;

Some small scale entrepreneurs are in mining. In [[Katanga Province]] 60 of the 75 mineral processing plants are owned by Chinese entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Simon|title=China Lets Child Workers Die Digging in Congo Mines for Copper|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=nw&amp;pname=mm_0908_story3.html|agency=Bloomberg|date=July 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese employers have been criticized for their use of [[child labor]] and lack of health and safety standards.&lt;ref name=bloomberg/&gt;

Major deals have been signed by Chinese state owned companies and the DRC government. In 2012, Chinese investors and the Export-Import Bank of China offered to build $6 billion worth of infrastructure as part of a loan backed by collateral in mineral rights.&lt;ref name=naturalresource&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ryan|first1=Greg|title=Natural resource extraction in the DRC: China - saviour or plunderer?|url=http://www.consultancyafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1726:natural-resource-extraction-in-the-drc-china-saviour-or-plunderer&amp;catid=58:asia-dimension-discussion-papers&amp;Itemid=264|date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These state owned enterprises have brought Chinese employees to the country.&lt;ref name=morningpost/&gt;

==Anti-Chinese violence==
Congolese mobs have attacked Chinese businesses on at least two occasions. In December 2010, local team TP Mazembe lost to Italian club [[Inter Milan]].&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|title=Unrest in DR Congo after TP Mazembe lose to Inter Milan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12030051|agency=BBC News|date=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobs in [[Lubumbashi]] were angered by the calls made by a Japanese referee who was mistaken for Chinese, provoking attacks on Chinese businesses in the city.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

During [[2015 Congolese protests|protests]] in January 2015 against the government of [[Joseph Kabila]], Chinese businesses in the Kinshasa neighborhoods of [[Ngaba]] and [[Kalamu]] were targeted for destruction.&lt;ref name=shops/&gt; An [[Agence France-Presse]] article on the attacks reported the motivation for violence was both resentment by local businesses that had difficulty competing against the low prices of Chinese run stores and association by rioters of Chinese nationals running stores with investment deals concluded by Chinese companies and the government.&lt;ref name=shops/&gt;

'''Cocama''' (Kokáma) is an [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[language]] spoken by thousands of native people in western [[South America]]. It is spoken along the banks of the Northeastern lower [[Ucayali]], lower [[Marañón river|Marañón]], and [[Huallaga River|Huallaga]] rivers and in neighboring areas of [[Brazil]] and an isolated area in [[Colombia]]. There are three dialects. The robust dialect is known as Cocama, Kokama, Kukama-Kukamiria, Ucayali, Xibitaoan, Huallaga, Pampadeque, and Pandequebo. By 1999, Cocamilla (Kokamíya) was moribund, being only spoken by people over 40.

Out of a projected ethnic population of 15,000, the majority of Cocama speakers, 2,000, live in Perú.  Remaining speakers live in Amazonas state in Brazil, where 50 out of 411 ethnic Chayahuitas speak it and it is known as Kokama or Kokamilla.  Most speakers are trilingual and can also speak Portuguese and Spanish. Very few are monolingual.  There are 20 ethnic groups in Colombia's Lower Putumayo area with an unknown number of Cocama-Cocamilla speakers.  Most expected speakers would also be trilingual, but the language may be extinct in the region.

Cocama speakers have a 3% literacy rate, compared with 50% for Spanish. Grammar rules have been developed and the language is written using the [[Latin script]]. Parts of the Bible have been translated into the language.

Cocama is closely related to [[Omagua language|Omagua]], a nearly extinct language spoken in Peru and Brazil.

== Revitalization efforts ==
In 2013, residents of [[Nauta]], [[Loreto Province]], Peru created a children's rap video in the Kukama-Kukamiria dialect, in collaboration with Radio Ucamara. The local radio station has been involved in conserving the language for "a few years," and "started managing a school called Ikuar, with the goal of teaching the language through songs and traditional story telling."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10154">'''Electracy''' is a theory by [[Gregory Ulmer]] that describes the kind of skills and facility necessary to exploit the full communicative potential of new [[electronic media]] such as [[multimedia]], [[hypermedia]], [[social software]], and [[virtual world]]s.  According to Ulmer, electracy "is to digital media what literacy is to print."&lt;ref&gt;Ulmer, G. L.  (2003). ''Internet Invention:  From Literacy to Electracy''. New York:  Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;  It encompasses the broader cultural, institutional, pedagogical, and ideological implications inherent in the transition from a culture of print literacy to a culture saturated with [[electronic media]]. "Electracy" is the term he gives to what is resulting from this major transition that our society is undergoing.  The term is a portmanteau word, combining "electrical" with "literacy", to allude to one of the fundamental terms used by the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] to name the relational spacing that enables and delimits any signification in any medium.

Electracy denotes a broad spectrum of research possibilities including the history and invention of writing and mnemonic practices, the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] and [[Ontology|ontological]] changes resulting from such practices, the sociological and psychological implications of a networked culture, and the pedagogical implementation of practices derived from such explorations.

Ulmer writes of electracy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What literacy is to the analytical mind, electracy is to the affective body: a prosthesis that enhances and augments a natural or organic human potential. Alphabetic writing is an artificial memory that supports long complex chains of reasoning impossible to sustain within the organic mind. Digital imaging similarly supports extensive complexes of mood atmospheres beyond organic capacity. Electrate logic proposes to design these atmospheres into affective group intelligence. Literacy and electracy in collaboration produce a civilizational left-brain right-brain integration. If literacy focused on universally valid methodologies of knowledge (sciences), electracy focuses on the individual state of mind within which knowing takes place (arts).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/glue/longman/pedagogy/electracy.html|title=Electracy and Pedagogy|work=CLAS Users}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ulmer's work benefits from considering other historical moments of radical technological change (such as the profound changes resulting from the inventions of the alphabet, writing, and the printing press), and thus his work is [[grammatology|grammatological]] insofar as it derives and extrapolates a methodology from the history of writing and mnemonic practices.  His career can be encapsulated as an attempt to invent a rhetoric for electronic media.

Ulmer introduced ''electracy'' in ''Teletheory'' (1989), and it began to be noted in the scholarship as early as 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, David. ''Internet Culture''. New York: Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been regarded as among the "most prominent" contemporary designations&lt;ref&gt;Inman, James. A. ''Computers and Writing: The Cyborg Era''. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; for what Walter J. Ong once described as a "secondary orality" that will eventually supplant print literacy&lt;ref&gt;Ong, Walter J. ''Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word''. London: Metheun, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; As James Inman writes, "It is important to distinguish ''electracy'' from other terms, such as computer-based literacy, Internet literacy, digital literacy, electronic literacies, [[metamedia]] literacy, and even cyber-punk literacy. None of these other terms have the breadth electracy does as a concept, and none of them draw their ontology from electronic media exclusively".&lt;ref&gt;Inman, James A. "Electracy for the Ages: Collaboration with the Past and Future." ''Electronic Collaboration in the Humanities: Issues and Options''. Ed. James A. Inman, Cheryl Reed, and Peter Sands. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2003. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have viewed the ''electracy'' paradigm, along with other "apparatus theories" such as Ong's, with skepticism, arguing that they are "essentialist" or "determinist".&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Inman's cautionary statement on page 161 of ''Computers and Writing: The Cyborg Era'' and a response essay by Stephen Tchudi in ''Electronic Collaboration in the Humanities'', pp. 79–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pedagogy ==

Ulmer's work has implications for the practice of education as well. Co-author of a textbook for freshman English courses,&lt;ref&gt;Scholes, R., Comley, N. &amp; Ulmer, G.L. (1994). ''Text Book: An Introduction to Literary Language 2nd Edition''.  New York:  St. Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ulmer develops undergraduate and graduate level courses which incorporate his theories and invite students into the process of inventing new practices and genres.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, student work posted at http://web.nwe.ufl.edu/~gulmer/s01/sevans2/, http://web.nwe.ufl.edu/~gulmer/course/mystory1.html, and http://www.anabiosispress.org/rsmyth/writings/diss/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Clinton, in a review of ''Internet Invention'', writes that "Ulmer's pedagogy ultimately levels the playing field between student and teacher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reconstruction.eserver.org/051/clinton.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120717113746/http://reconstruction.eserver.org/051/clinton.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-17 |title=Reconstruction 5.1 (Winter 2005) |publisher=Reconstruction.eserver.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic Lisa Gye also recognizes the pedagogical implications of Ulmer's work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The transition from a predominantly literate culture to an electronic culture is already engendering changes in the ways in which we think, write and exchange ideas. Ulmer has been concerned with the kinds of changes that take place as a result of this transition and his primary concern has been a pedagogical one – that is, he is interested in how learning is transformed by the shift from the apparatus of literacy to the apparatus of what he comes to term 'electracy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue2/issue2_gye.html |title=FCJ-006 Halflives, A Mystory: Writing Hypertext to Learn &amp;#124; The Fibreculture Journal : 02 |publisher=Journal.fibreculture.org |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Electracy as an educational aim has been recognized by scholars in several fields, including English composition and rhetoric,&lt;ref&gt;See Inman and also Leander, Kevin, and Paul Prior, "Speaking and Writing: How Talk and Text Interact in Situated Practices," ''What Writing Does and How It Does It: An Introduction to Analyzing Texts and Textual Practices'', ed. Charles Bazerman and Paul Prior, Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; literary and media criticism,&lt;ref&gt;O'Gorman, Marcel. ''E-Crit: Digital Media, Critical Theory, and the Humanities''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; digital media and art, and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Mitrasinovic, Miodrag, ''Total Landscape, Theme Parks, Public Space'', Aldershot, England, and Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing, 2006; Muecke, Mikesch W. ''Gottfried Semper in Zurich: An Intersection of Theory and Practice''. Ames, IA: Culicidae Architectural Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mikesch Muecke explains that "Gregory Ulmer's ideas on ''electracy'' provide ... a model for a new pedagogy where learning is closer to invention than verification."&lt;ref&gt;Muecke, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Ulmer himself writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Electrate pedagogy is based in art/aesthetics as relays for operating new media organized as a prosthesis for learning any subject whatsoever. The near absence of art in contemporary schools is the electrate equivalent of the near absence of science in medieval schools for literacy. The suppression of empirical inquiry by religious dogmatism during the era sometimes called the "dark ages" (reflecting the hostility of the oral apparatus to literacy), is paralleled today by the suppression of aesthetic play by empirical utilitarianism (reflecting the hostility of the literate apparatus to electracy). The ambivalent relation of the institutions of school and entertainment today echoes the ambivalence informing church-science relations throughout the era of literacy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ulmer's educational methods fit into a broader paradigm shift in pedagogical theory and practice known as [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]. He discusses the relationship between pedagogy and electracy at length in an interview with Sung-Do Kim published in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Sung-Do. "The Grammatology of the Future" (An Interview with Gregory Ulmer). ''Deconstructing Derrida: Tasks for the New Humanities''. Ed. Peter Pericles Trifonas and Michael A. Peters. New York: Palgrave-Macmillan, 2005. 137–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2598">The '''European Charter on Freedom of the Press''' is a non-binding guideline on [[press freedom]], signed on 25 May 2009 in [[Hamburg]] by 48 editors-in-chief and leading journalists from 19 European countries. It is open for signature by all journalists, e.g. the prohibition of [[censorship]], free access to national and foreign media sources and freedom to gather and disseminate information.&lt;ref name="PressFreedom"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecpmf.eu/ecpmf/charter |title=European Charter on Freedom of the Press |publisher=European Centre for Press &amp; Media Freedom |access-date=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charter condense in 10 articles the main [[media freedom]] principles, including the right to safety from surveillance, electronic eavesdropping and searches of editorial departments and computers, and remarks the need for unimpeded access for journalists and citizens to all domestic and foreign sources of information. It formulates the main values that public authorities - including EU institutions - should respect when dealing with journalists.&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-09-891_en.htm?locale=en |title=Commissioner Reding welcomes New European Charter on Freedom of the Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/New_European_Charter_Lays_Down_Guidelines_For_Press_Freedom/1740966.html|title=New Free-Press Guidelines For Europe|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the Charter was born in 2007 out of the yearly policy dialogue which started in 2005 between [[European Commission]]er [[Viviane Reding]] (assisted by the Commission's Media Task Force) and the editors-in-chief of European newspapers, headed by [[Stern]]'s [[Hans-Ulrich Jörges]]. &lt;ref name=EC/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Charter was handed to the [[European Commission]] in Brussels on 9 June 2009 and to the [[Council of Europe]] in Luxembourg on 26 October 2009, with the aim that it may become a benchmark in their assessment exercises on [[media freedom]] in member and candidate countries, and that it may empower journalists across Europe in their relations with state authorities.&lt;ref name=PressFreedom /&gt;

}}

'''Gallo''' is a [[languages of France|regional language of France]]. It is not as commonly spoken as it once was, as the standard form of [[French language|French]] now predominates. Gallo is classified as one of the [[Langues d'oïl|Oïl languages]].

Gallo was originally spoken in the [[Marches of Neustria]], which now corresponds to the border lands of Brittany and Normandy and its former heart in [[Le Mans]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]]. Gallo was the shared spoken language of several of those who took part in the [[Norman conquest of England]], most of whom originated in [[Lower Brittany]] and [[Lower Normandy]]. Thus, Gallo was a vehicle for the subsequent transformation ("Gallicisation") of English, along with the [[Norman language]].

Gallo continued as the language of [[Higher Brittany]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]] and some neighbouring portions of [[Normandy]] until the introduction of universal education across France, but today Gallo is spoken by only a small minority of the population, having been largely superseded by standard [[French language|French]].

As an Oïl language, Gallo forms part of a [[dialect continuum]] which includes [[Norman language|Norman]], [[Picard language|Picard]] and the [[Poitevin dialect]], among others. One of the features that distinguish it from Norman is the absence of [[Old Norse]] influence. There is some limited [[mutual intelligibility]] with adjacent varieties of the Norman language along the linguistic frontier and with [[Guernésiais]] and [[Jèrriais]]. However, as the dialect continuum shades towards [[Mayenne|Mayennais]], there is a less clear [[isogloss]]. The clearest isogloss is that distinguishing Gallo from [[Breton language|Breton]], a [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic Celtic language]] traditionally spoken in the western territory of Brittany.

In the west, the vocabulary of Gallo has been influenced by contact with Breton, but remains overwhelmingly Latinate. The influence of Breton decreases eastwards across Gallo-speaking territory.

{{as of|1980}}, Gallo's western extent stretches from [[Plouha]] (''Plóha''), in [[Côtes-d'Armor]], south of [[Paimpol]] (''Paimpol''), passing through [[Châtelaudren]] (''Châtié''), [[Corlay]] (''Corlaè''), [[Loudéac]] (''Loudia''), east of [[Pontivy]] (''Pontivy''), [[Locminé]] (''Lominoec''), [[Vannes]] (''Vannes'') and ending in the south, east of the Rhuys peninsula, in [[Morbihan]].

==Etymology==
{{see also|Linguistic boundary of Brittany}}
The term ''gallo'' is sometimes spelled ''galo'' or ''gallot''.&lt;ref name="Chevalier"&gt;{{Citation |last=Chevalier |first=Gwendal |title=Gallo et Breton, complémentarité ou concurrence? |date=2008 |url=https://hal-univ-lyon3.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00369542 |work=Cahiers de sociolinguistique |issue=12 |pages=75-109 |trans-title=Gallo and Breton, complementarity or competition? |language=fr |access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as ''langue gallèse'' or ''britto-roman'' in [[Brittany]].&lt;ref name="Chevalier" /&gt; In south [[Lower Normandy]] and in the west of [[Pays de la Loire]] it is often referred to as [[patois]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/gallo.htm |title=Gallo language, alphabet and pronunciation |website=Omniglot.com |access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is a matter of some contention.&lt;ref&gt;Leray, Christian and Lorand, Ernestine. Dynamique interculturelle et autoformation: une histoire de vie en Pays gallo. L'Harmattan. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gallo'' comes from the [[Breton language|Breton]] word ''gall'', meaning "foreigner",  "French" or "non-Breton".&lt;ref name="Chevalier" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walter|first1=Henriette|title=Les langues régionales de France : le gallo, pris comme dans un étau (17/20)|url=http://www.canalacademie.com/ida6813-Les-langues-regionales-de-France-le-gallo-pris-comme-dans-un-etau.html|website=www.canalacademie.com|publisher=Canal Académie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celtic, Latin and Germanic roots==
The [[Celts]] settled in [[Armorica]] toward the 8th century BCE. Some of early groups mentioned in the written records of the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] were the [[Redones]] and the [[Namnetes]]. They spoke dialects of the [[Gaulish language]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celticcountries.com/society/18-gallo-language Celtic Countries], "Gallo Language" 04 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and maintained important economic ties with the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref name="ict.griffith.edu.au"&gt;[http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/wiseman/DECB/DECBps.html] "The Ruin and Conquest of Britain 400 A.D. - 600 A.D" 04 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Julius Caesar]]'s invasion of Armorica in 56 BC led to a sort of  [[Romanization]] of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Places/Place/781091 Ancient Worlds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106060909/http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Places/Place/781091 |date=2012-01-06 }} "Armorica" 04 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Gaulish continued to be spoken in this region until the 6th century CE,&lt;ref&gt;[http://indoeuro.bizland.com/tree/selt/gaulish.html]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "Gaulish Language" 04 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; especially in less populated, rural areas. When the [[Bretons]] emigrated to Armorica around this time, they found a people who had retained their Celtic language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bretagne.fr/internet/jcms/prod_192282/languages Bretagne.fr] "An Overview of the Languages Used in Brittany" 04 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bretons were therefore able to integrate easily.

In contrast to Armorica's western countryside, [[Nantes]] and [[Rennes]] were Roman cultural centres. Following the [[Migration Period]],&lt;ref name="ict.griffith.edu.au"/&gt; these two cities, as well as regions to the east of the [[Vilaine]], including the town [[Vannes]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/623076/Vannes Encyclopædia Britannica], "Vannes" 13 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; fell under [[Franks|Frankish]] rule.&lt;ref name="ict.griffith.edu.au"/&gt;  Thus, during the [[Merovingian dynasty]], the population of Armorica was diverse, consisting of Gaulish tribes with assimilated Bretons, as well as Romanized cities and Germanic tribes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/mladjov/files/french_rulers.pdf] "France" 04 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  War between the Frank and Breton kingdoms was constant between the 6th and 9th centuries,&lt;ref name="ict.griffith.edu.au"/&gt; which made the border between the two difficult to define.  Before the 10th century, Breton was spoken by at least one third of the population&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sorosoro.org/en/breton Sorosoro] "Breton" 04 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; up to the cities of Pornic and Avranches.

== Decline of Gallo ==
Historically, France has been a nation with a high degree of linguistic diversity matched with relative tolerance, that is until the French Revolution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gallo's status as a tolerated regional language of France suffered as a direct consequence of the French Revolution. During the revolution, the Jacobins viewed regional languages as a way in which the structural inequalities of France were perpetuated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Accordingly, they sought to eradicate regional languages to free regional language speakers of their unconstitutional inequalities.

The consequences of the revolution on Gallo stretch into recent history. Within the 1900s, government policy directly affected the use of minority languages in France. In 1962, Charles de Gaulle established the Haut Comité pour la défense et l'expansion de la langue française; this French Language policy's purpose was to enforce the traditional dialect of French, to the detriment of minority languages.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation |last=Radford |first=Gavin |title=French language law: The attempted ruination of France's linguistic diversity |date=2015-03-04 |url=http://trinitycollegelawreview.org/french-language-law-the-attempted-ruination-of-frances-linguistic-diversity/ |work=Trinity College Law Review (TCLR) online |language=en-GB |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 1994, the Loi Toubon declared that any governmental publications and advertisements must be in French.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, the use of Gallo declined due to direct government actions.

Furthermore, Gallo speakers began to associate French as the language of intellectuals and social promotion, and their Gallo language as an impediment to their success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/676254/filename/article_marges_linguistiques_enseignement_du_gallo.pdf|title=Le Gallo dans l'eseignement, l'enseignement du gallo|last=D'Herve|first=Gildas|date=|website=|publisher=Marges linguistiques|access-date=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the rate of children learning the language has diminished, since parents  struggle to see the benefit of Gallo in their children's future.

== Gallo and education ==
Within recent history, the presence of Gallo has fluctuated in Brittany's school system. Shortly before World War II, the Regional Federation of Bretagne introduced the idea of rejuvenating Gallo's presences in schools.&lt;ref name="Le-Coq"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Le-Coq |first=André |date=2009-09-01 |title=L'enseignement du gallo |url=https://trema.revues.org/942 |journal=Tréma |language=fr |issue=31 |pages=39–45 |doi=10.4000/trema.942 |issn=1167-315X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were primarily motivated in increasing the linguistic competence of children.&lt;ref name="Le-Coq" /&gt;

In 1982, Gallo was officially adopted as an optional subject in high schools in Brittany, even appearing on France's high school-exit exam, the Baccalaureat.&lt;ref name="Le-Coq" /&gt; It took years for the Gallo language to actually be incorporated into the curriculum, but by the 1990s, the main focus of the curriculum was cultural awareness of the Gallo language and identity.&lt;ref name="Le-Coq" /&gt; However, in 2002, Gallo's optional-subject status in high schools was withdrawn.&lt;ref name="Le-Coq" /&gt;

In reaction to the 2002 decision, an effective and committed network of Gallo activists advanced Gallo's status in Brittany schools.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nolan |first=John Shaun |date=2008 |title=The Role of Gallo in the Identity of Upper-Breton School Pupils of the Language Variety and their Parents |url=https://www.academia.edu/5648128/The_Role_of_Gallo_in_the_Identity_of_Upper-Breton_School_Pupils_of_the_Language_Variety_and_their_Parents?auto=download |journal=Sociolinguistic Studies |language=en |volume=2 |issue=1 |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallo is now taught in Upper Brittany's state schools, though the population of students enrolled in Gallo courses remains low. In the academic year of 2003 to 2004, there were 569 students learning Gallo at high school or college.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For comparison, in the same year, 3791 students were learning Breton in either high school or college.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Status==
[[Image:Loudéac bilingual sign Gallo.jpg|left|thumb|The town of [[Loudéac]] displays its Gallo name, ''Loudia'', on signage]]
One of the metro stations of the Breton capital, [[Rennes]], has bilingual signage in [[French language|French]] and Gallo, but generally the Gallo language is not as visibly high-profile as the Breton language, even in its traditional heartland of the ''Pays Gallo'', which includes the two historical capitals of [[Rennes]] (Gallo ''Resnn'', Breton ''Roazhon'') and [[Nantes]] (Gallo ''Nauntt'', Breton ''Naoned'').

Different dialects of Gallo are distinguished, although there is a movement for standardisation on the model of the dialect of [[Upper Brittany]].

It is difficult to record the exact number of Gallo speakers today. Gallo and vernacular French share a social-linguistic landscape, so speakers have difficulty determining exactly which language they are speaking.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nolan |first=John Shaun |date=2011 |title=Reassessing Gallo as a regional language in France: language emancipation vs. monolingual language ideology |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269406884_Reassessing_Gallo_as_a_regional_language_in_France_language_emancipation_vs_monolingual_language_ideology |journal=International Journal of the Sociology of Language |volume=2011 |issue=209 |doi=10.1515/ijsl.2011.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes estimates of the number of speakers vary widely.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Literature==
Although a written literary tradition exists, Gallo is more noted for extemporised story-telling and theatrical presentations. Given Brittany's rich musical heritage, contemporary performers produce a range of music sung in Gallo (see [[Music of Brittany]]).

The roots of written Gallo literature are traced back to ''Le Livre des Manières'' written in 1178 by Etienne de Fougères, a poetical text of 336 quatrains and the earliest known Romance text from Brittany, and to ''Le Roman d'Aquin'', an anonymous 12th century chanson de geste transcribed in the 15th century but which nevertheless retains features typical of the mediaeval Romance of Brittany. In the 19th century oral literature was collected by researchers and folklorists such as Paul Sébillot, Adolphe Orain, Amand Dagnet and Georges Dottin. Amand Dagnet (1857-1933) also wrote a number of original works in Gallo, including a play ''La fille de la Brunelas'' (1901).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourel|first=Claude|title=Contes et récits du Pays Gallo du XIIe siècle à nos jours|year=2001|publisher=Astoure|location=Fréhel|isbn=2845830262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the 1970s that a concerted effort to promote Gallo literature started. In 1979 Alan J. Raude published a proposed standardised orthography for Gallo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Paroles d'oïl|year=1994|publisher=Geste|location=Mougon|isbn=2905061952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rise of nationalism in the Balkans}}

The '''Greek War of Independence''', also known as the '''Greek Revolution''' ({{lang-el|Ελληνική Επανάσταση, Elliniki Epanastasi}}, or also referred to by Greeks in the 19th century as the Αγώνας, ''Agonas'', "'''Struggle'''"; [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman]]: يونان عصياني ''Yunan İsyanı'', "'''Greek Uprising'''"), was a successful [[war of independence]] waged by Greek revolutionaries against the [[Ottoman Empire]] between 1821 and 1830. The Greeks were later assisted by the [[Russian Empire]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], and the [[Bourbon Restoration|Kingdom of France]], while the Ottomans were aided by their North African vassals, the [[eyalet]]s of [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]], [[Ottoman Algeria|Algeria]], and [[Ottoman Tripolitania|Tripolitania]], and the [[Beylik of Tunis]].

Even several decades before the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the Ottoman Empire in 1453, most of [[Greece]] had come under Ottoman rule.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Finkel Osman's Dream p.17&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, there were [[Ottoman Greece#Uprisings before 1821|several revolt attempts by Greeks]] to gain independence from Ottoman control.&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, ''A Story of Modern Greece'', 'The Dark Age of Greece (1453–1800)', p. 113, Faber and Faber (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814, a secret organization called the [[Filiki Eteria]] was founded with the aim of liberating Greece. The Filiki Eteria planned to launch revolts in the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Danubian Principalities]], and in [[Constantinople]] and its surrounding areas. By late 1821, the insurrection had been planned for 25 March (Julian Calendar) 1821, on the Feast of the Annunciation for the Orthodox Christians. However, as the plans of Filiki Eteria had been discovered by the Ottoman authorities, the revolutionary action started earlier. The first of these revolts began on  6 March/22 February 1821 in the Danubian Principalities, but it was soon put down by the Ottomans. The events in the north urged the Greeks in the Peloponnese into action and on 17 March 1821, the [[Maniots]] declared war on the Ottomans. This declaration was the start of a spring of revolutionary actions from other controlled states against the Ottoman Empire.

On 25 March the revolution was officially declared and by the end of the month, the Peloponnese was in open revolt against the Turks. By October 1821, the Greeks under [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] had captured [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]]. The Peloponnesian revolt was quickly followed by revolts in [[Crete]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], and [[Central Greece]], which would soon be suppressed. Meanwhile, the makeshift Greek navy was achieving success against the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman navy]] in the [[Aegean Sea]] and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea.

Tensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars. In the meantime, the [[Ottoman Sultan]] negotiated with [[Mehmet Ali of Egypt]], who agreed to send his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gain. Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and had immediate success: by the end of 1825, most of the Peloponnese was under Egyptian control, and the city of [[Missolonghi]] fell in April 1826 after a [[Third Siege of Missolonghi|year-long siege]] by the Turks. Although [[Ottoman–Egyptian invasion of Mani|Ibrahim was defeated in Mani]], he had succeeded in suppressing most of the revolt in the Peloponnese, and Athens had been retaken.

Following years of negotiation, three Great Powers—Russia, Britain and France—decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to Greece. Following news that combined Ottoman–Egyptian fleets were going to attack the Greek island of [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]], the allied fleet intercepted the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet at [[Pylos|Navarino]]. The [[Battle of Navarino|battle]] began after a tense week-long standoff, ending in the destruction of the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet. By 1828 the Egyptian army withdrew under pressure of a [[Morea expedition|French expeditionary force]] to which the Ottoman garrisons in the Peloponnese then surrendered, while the Greeks proceeded to the Ottoman-controlled part of central Greece. After eight years of war, Greece was finally recognized as an independent, sovereign state under the [[London Protocol (1830)|London Protocol]] of February 1830. Later, in 1832, the [[London Conference of 1832|London Conference]] and the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)|Treaty of Constantinople]] defined the final borders of the new state and established [[Otto of Greece|Prince Otto]] of Bavaria as the first king of Greece.

The Greek Revolution is celebrated by the modern Greek state as a [[Greek Independence Day|national day]] on 25 March.

==Background==
{{Details|Background of the Greek War of Independence}}

===Ottoman rule===
{{See also|Ottoman Greece}}
The [[Fall of Constantinople]] on 29&amp;nbsp;May 1453 and the subsequent fall of the successor states of the Byzantine Empire marked the end of Byzantine sovereignty. After that, the Ottoman Empire ruled the Balkans and Anatolia, with some exceptions.{{cref|i}} Orthodox Christians were granted some political rights under Ottoman rule, but they were considered inferior subjects.&lt;ref name="B118"&gt;Barker, ''Religious Nationalism in Modern Europe'', p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Greeks were called [[Rayah]] by the Turks, a name that referred to the large mass of non-Muslim subjects under the Ottoman [[ruling class]].{{cref|ii}}&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition, Houghton Mifflin Company, (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Greek intellectuals and humanists, who had migrated west before or during the Ottoman invasions, such as [[Demetrios Chalkokondyles]] and [[Leonardos Philaras]], began to call for the liberation of their homeland.&lt;ref name="BisMil"&gt;Bisaha, ''Creating East and West'', 114–115&lt;br/&gt;* Milton (&amp; Diekhoff), ''Milton on himself'', 267&lt;/ref&gt; Demetrius Chalcondyles called on Venice and "all of the Latins" to aid the Greeks against "the abominable, monstrous, and impious barbarian Turks".&lt;ref&gt;Bisaha, Nancy (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WU_wy3qbLsIC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=%22all+of+the+latins%22+Chalcondyles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tRpoGFTFhk&amp;sig=ySvR-CAkbsX8QW4zNtGWXxf499k&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22all%20of%20the%20latins%22%20Chalcondyles&amp;f=false Creating East and West: Renaissance humanists and the Ottoman Turks]''. University of Pennsylvania Prees {{ISBN|0-8122-3806-0}}. p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Greece was to remain under Ottoman rule for several more centuries.

The Greek Revolution was not an isolated event; numerous failed attempts at regaining independence took place throughout the history of the Ottoman era. Throughout the 17th century there was great resistance to the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]] in the [[Morea]] and elsewhere, as evidenced by revolts led by [[Dionysius the Philosopher]].&lt;ref name="Kassis29"&gt;Kassis, ''Mani's History'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Morean War]], the [[Peloponnese]] came under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule for 30 years, and remained in turmoil from then on and throughout the 17th century, as the bands of [[klepht]]s multiplied.&lt;ref name="Kassis31-33"&gt;Kassis, ''Mani's History'', pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first great uprising was the Russian-sponsored [[Orlov Revolt]] of the 1770s, which was crushed by the Ottomans after having limited success. After the crushing of the uprising, Muslim Albanians ravaged many regions in mainland Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Svoronos, ''History of Modern Greece'', p. 59&lt;br /&gt;* Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', p.336&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Maniots]] continually resisted Ottoman rule, and defeated several Ottoman incursions into their region, the most famous of which was the [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1770)|invasion of 1770]].&lt;ref name="Kassis35"&gt;Kassis, ''Mani's History'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)|Second Russo-Turkish War]], the Greek community of [[Trieste]] financed a small fleet under [[Lambros Katsonis]], which was a nuisance for the Ottoman navy; during the war klephts and ''armatoloi'' (guerilla fighters in mountainous areas) rose once again.&lt;ref&gt;Svoronos, ''History of Modern Greece'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, a number of Greeks enjoyed a privileged position in the Ottoman state as members of the Ottoman bureaucracy. Greeks controlled the affairs of the Orthodox Church through the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]], as the higher clergy of the Orthodox Church was mostly of Greek origin. Thus, as a result of the Ottoman [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]], the predominantly Greek hierarchy of the Patriarchate enjoyed control over the Empire's Orthodox subjects (the ''Rum milleti''&lt;ref name="Arnakis, p. 238"&gt;Georgiadis–Arnakis, ''The Greek Church of Constantinople'', p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="B118" /&gt;

The [[Greek Orthodox Church]] played a pivotal role in the preservation of national identity, the development of Greek society and the resurgence of Greek nationalism.{{cref|iii}} From the early 18th century and onwards, members of prominent Greek families in Constantinople, known as [[Phanariotes]] (after the [[Fener|Phanar]] district of the city) gained considerable control over Ottoman foreign policy and eventually over the bureaucracy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Paparrigopoulos, ''History of the Hellenic Nation'', Eb, p. 108&lt;br /&gt;* Svoronos, ''The Greek Nation'', p. 89&lt;br /&gt;* Trudgill, "Greece and European Turkey", p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

====Klephts and armatoloi====
[[File:BoningtonArmatolos.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a Greek armatolos by [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] (oil painting, 1825–1826, Benaki Museum)]]

In times of militarily weak central authority, the Balkan countryside became infested by groups of bandits that struck at Muslims and Christians alike, called "[[klepht]]s" ({{lang-el|κλέφτες}}) in Greece, the equivalent of the [[hajduk]]s. Defying Ottoman rule, the klephts were highly admired and held a significant place in popular lore.&lt;ref name="CloggCH40"&gt;Clogg, ''A Concise History of Greece'', pp. 9, 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to the klephts' attacks, the Ottomans recruited the ablest amongst these groups, contracting Christian militias, known as "[[armatoloi]]" ({{lang-el|αρματολοί}}), to secure endangered areas, especially mountain passes.{{cref|iv}} The area under their control was called an "armatolik",&lt;ref name="Koliopoulos27"&gt;Koliopoulos, ''Brigands with a Cause'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; the oldest known being established in [[Agrafa]] during the reign of [[Murad II]] (r. 1421–1451).&lt;ref name="VacalopoulosGreekNation"&gt;Vacalopoulos, ''The Greek Nation, 1453–1669'', p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between klephts and ''armatoloi'' was not clear, as the latter would often turn into klephts to extort more benefits from the authorities, while, conversely, another klepht group would be appointed to the ''armatolik'' to confront their predecessors.&lt;ref name="Batalas156"&gt;Batalas, ''Irregular Armed Forces'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, klephts and ''armatoloi'' formed a provincial elite, though not a social class, whose members would muster under a common goal.&lt;ref name="Batalas154"&gt;Batalas, ''Irregular Armed Forces'', p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; As the ''armatoloi'''s position gradually turned into a hereditary one, some captains took care of their ''armatolik'' as their personal property. A great deal of power was placed in their hands and they integrated in the network of clientelist relationships that formed the Ottoman administration.&lt;ref name="Batalas156" /&gt; Some managed to establish exclusive control in their ''armatolik'', forcing the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] to try repeatedly, though unsuccessfully, to eliminate them.&lt;ref name="Batalas156-7"&gt;Batalas, ''Irregular Armed Forces'', pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the War of Independence powerful ''armatoloi'' could be traced in [[Rumeli]], Thessaly, Epirus and southern Macedonia.&lt;ref name="Koliopoulos29"&gt;Koliopoulos, ''Brigands with a Cause'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; To the revolutionary leader and writer [[Yannis Makriyannis]], klephts and ''armatoloi''—being the only available major military force on the side of the Greeks—played such a crucial role in the Greek revolution that he referred to them as the "yeast of liberty".&lt;ref name="el.wikisource.org"&gt;Makriyannis, ''Memoirs'', [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%BD%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%BF%CE%BD%CE%B5%CF%8D%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B1_%CE%9C%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%81%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%AC%CE%BD%CE%BD%CE%B7_9 IX] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002043939/http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%BD%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%BF%CE%BD%CE%B5%CF%8D%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B1_%CE%9C%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%81%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%AC%CE%BD%CE%BD%CE%B7_9 |date=2 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment and the Greek national movement===
{{See also|Modern Greek Enlightenment}}
[[File:Adamantios Korais.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adamantios Korais]]]]

Due to economic developments within and outside the Ottoman Empire in the 18th century, Greek merchants and sailors became affluent and generated the wealth necessary to found schools and libraries, and to pay for young Greeks to study at the universities of Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, "Greece and European Turkey", p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; There they came into contact with the radical ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|European Enlightenment]], the French Revolution and romantic nationalism.&lt;ref name="Cl48"&gt;Clogg, ''A Concise History of Greece '', pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Educated and influential members of the large Greek diaspora, such as [[Adamantios Korais]] and [[Anthimos Gazis]], tried to transmit these ideas back to the Greeks, with the double aim of raising their educational level and simultaneously strengthening their national identity. This was achieved through the dissemination of books, pamphlets and other writings in Greek, in a process that has been described as the [[Diafotismos|modern Greek Enlightenment]] ({{lang-el|Διαφωτισμός}}).&lt;ref name="Cl48" /&gt;

[[File:Rigas Feraios 01.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Rigas Feraios]] (d.&amp;nbsp;1798), intellectual and revolutionary, is regarded as a forerunner of the Greek Revolution.]]

Crucial for the development of the Greek national idea were the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the 18th century. [[Peter the Great]] had envisaged a disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and the re-institution of a new Byzantine Empire with an Orthodox emperor. His [[Pruth River Campaign]] of 1711 set a precedent for the Greeks, when Peter appealed to Orthodox Christians to join the Russians and rise against the Turks to fight for "''faith and homeland''".  The Russo-Turkish wars of Catherine II (1762-1796) made the Greeks  consider their emancipation with the aid of Russia. An independence movement in Peloponnesus (Morea) was incited by Russian agents in 1769, and a Greek flotilla under Lambros Katsonis assisted the Russian fleet in the war of 1788-1792.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YwbHCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Lucien J. Frary, Russia and the Making of Modern Greek Identity, 1821-1844, OUP Oxford, 11 June 2015, p.  20, 21.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek revolts of the 18th century were unsuccessful but far larger than the revolts of previous centuries, and they announced the initiative for a national revolution.&lt;ref&gt;From the Greek translation of Svoronos (Nicolas), ''Histoire de la Grèce moderne'', Presses Universitaires de France, Paris, 1972., pp. 59-61 of the Greek edition, "Themelio", Athens.&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolutionary nationalism grew across Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries (including in the Balkans), due to the influence of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Paroulakis32"&gt;Goldstein, ''Wars and Peace Treaties'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; As the power of the Ottoman Empire declined, Greek nationalism began to assert itself.&lt;ref name="BoimeTr"&gt;Boime, ''Social History of Modern Art'', pp. 194–196&lt;br /&gt;* Trudgill, "Greece and European Turkey", p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential of the Greek writers and intellectuals was [[Rigas Feraios]]. Deeply influenced by the French Revolution, Rigas was the first to conceive and organize a comprehensive national movement aiming at the liberation of all [[Balkans|Balkan]] nations—including the Turks of the region—and the creation of a "Balkan Republic". Arrested by [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] officials in [[Trieste]] in 1797, he was handed over to Ottoman officials and transported to [[Belgrade]] along with his co-conspirators. All of them were strangled to death in June 1798 and their bodies were dumped in the [[Danube]].&lt;ref&gt;Svoronos, ''History of Modern Greece'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Rigas fanned the flames of Greek nationalism; his nationalist poem, the "Thourios" (war-song), was translated into a number of Western European and later [[Languages of the Balkans|Balkan languages]] and served as a rallying cry for Greeks against Ottoman rule.&lt;ref name="Paroulakis32 2"&gt;Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence'', p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influential Greek writer and intellectual was [[Adamantios Korais]] who witnessed the French Revolution. Korais' primary intellectual inspiration was from the Enlightenment, and he borrowed ideas from Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. When Korais was a young adult he moved to Paris to continue his studies. He eventually graduated from the Montpellier School of Medicine and spent the remainder of his life in Paris. He would often have political and philosophical debates with Thomas Jefferson. While in Paris he was a witness to the French Revolution and saw the democracy that came out of it. He spent a lot of his time convincing wealthy Greeks to build schools and libraries to further the education of Greeks. He believed that a furthering in education would be necessary for the general welfare and prosperity of the people of Greece, as well as the country. Korais' ultimate goal was a democratic Greece much like the Golden Age of Pericles but he died before the end of the revolution.

The connection of the Greek Revolution with the Enlightenment and the French Revolution has been questioned by several Greek authors, who considered this theory mechanistic and false.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antifono.gr/portal/%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B5%CF%82/%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%B1-%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B1-%CE%B3%CE%B5%CF%89%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE/%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%84%CF%8C%CF%82-%CE%BB%CF%8C%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82/4775-%CF%84%CE%B1-%CF%83%CF%87%CE%AE%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B1-%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BC%CE%B7%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF-21-%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%B8%CE%BF%CF%82-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%B4%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%AC.html Diamantis Apostolos, "Schemes for the explanation of 21". 24 March 2014, antifono.gr, in greek language.

Mantouvalou is professor of Modern and Medieval Greek Philology at the University of Athens.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Th. Proussis, the main external factor who contributed to the progress to the Revolution was Russia. Since the era of Peter the Great, Russia envisioned a Christian battle against the Turks under his leadership. Greece has been involved in the Russian plans since the [[Orlov revolt|revolution of 1770]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://ojs.lib.uom.gr/index.php/BalkanStudies/article/view/2338/2362 Theophilus C.

The Greek cause began to draw support not only from the large Greek merchant diaspora in both Western Europe and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], but also from Western European [[Philhellenism|Philhellenes]].&lt;ref name="BoimeTr"/&gt; This Greek movement for independence was not only the first movement of national character in Eastern Europe, but also the first one in a non-Christian environment, like the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Clogg, ''A Concise History of Greece'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filiki Eteria===
{{Main|Filiki Eteria}}
[[File:Filiki Eteria oath.jpg|thumb|Oath of the [[Filiki Eteria]]]]

Feraios' martyrdom was to inspire three young Greek merchants: [[Nikolaos Skoufas]], [[Emmanuil Xanthos]], and [[Athanasios Tsakalov]]. Influenced by the Italian [[Carbonari]] and profiting from their own experience as members of [[Freemasonry|Freemasonic]] organizations, they founded in 1814 the secret [[Filiki Eteria]] ("Friendly Society") in [[Odessa]], an important center of the Greek mercantile diaspora in [[Russian Empire|Russia]].&lt;ref name="Clogg31"&gt;Clogg, ''A Concise History of Greece'', p. 31&lt;br/&gt;* Dakin, ''The Greek struggle for independence'', pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of wealthy Greek exile communities in Britain and the United States and with the aid of sympathizers in Western Europe, they planned the rebellion.&lt;ref name="Jelavich204-05"&gt;Jelavich, ''History of the Balkans'', pp. 204–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society's basic objective was a revival of the Byzantine Empire, with Constantinople as the capital, not the formation of a national state.&lt;ref name="Jelavich204-05"/&gt; In early 1820, [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], an official from the [[Ionian Islands]] who had become the joint [[List of Russian foreign ministers|foreign minister]] of [[Tsar Alexander I]], was approached by the Society in order to be named leader but declined the offer; the ''Filikoi'' (members of Filiki Eteria) then turned to [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792-1828)|Alexander Ypsilantis]], a Phanariote serving in the Russian army as general and adjutant to Alexander, who accepted.&lt;ref name="Clogg31-2"&gt;Clogg, ''A Concise History of Greece'', pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

The Filiki Eteria expanded rapidly and was soon able to recruit members in all areas of the Greek world and among all elements of the Greek society.{{cref|v}} In 1821, the Ottoman Empire mainly faced war against [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]] and more particularly the revolt by [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina|Ali Pasha]] in Epirus, which had forced the ''vali'' (governor) of the Morea, [[Hursid Pasha]], and other local pashas to leave their provinces and campaign against the rebel force. At the same time, the [[Great Power]]s, allied in the "[[Concert of Europe]]" in opposition to revolutions in the aftermath of [[Napoleon I of France]], were preoccupied with [[Revolutions of 1820|revolts in Italy and Spain]]. It was in this context that the Greeks judged the time ripe for their own revolt. The plan originally involved uprisings in three places, the Peloponnese, the [[Danubian Principalities]] and Constantinople.&lt;ref name="Sowards"&gt;{{cite news|title=Twenty-five Lectures on Modern Balkan History: The Greek Revolution and the Greek State |last=Sowards |first=Steven |publisher=[[Michigan State University]] |url=http://www.lib.msu.edu/sowards/balkan/lecture6.html |date=14 June 1999 |accessdate=31 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510143919/http://www.lib.msu.edu/sowards/balkan/lecture6.html |archivedate=10 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philhellenism==

Because of the Greek origin of so much of the West's classical heritage, there was tremendous sympathy for the Greek cause throughout Europe. Some wealthy Americans and [[Western Europe]]an aristocrats, such as the renowned poet [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and later the physician [[Samuel Gridley Howe|Samuel Howe]], took up arms to join the Greek revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Richard, Laura E. ''Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe'', pages 21–26. Boston: Dana Estes &amp; Company, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many more also financed the revolution. The [[London Philhellenic Committee]] helped insurgent Greece to float two loans in 1824 (£800,000) and 1825 (£2,000,000).&lt;ref&gt;Wynne William H., (1951), State insolvency and foreign bondholders, New Haven, Yale University Press, vol. 2, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish philhellene [[Thomas Gordon (British army officer)|Thomas Gordon]] took part in the revolutionary struggle and later wrote the first histories of the Greek revolution in English. According to Albert Boime, "The philhellenes willingly overlooked many of the contradictory stories about Greek atrocities, because they had nowhere else to deposit their libertarian impulses."&lt;ref&gt;Boime, ''Social History of Modern Art'', 191&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the Greek revolt aroused widespread sympathy among the public, although at first it was met with lukewarm and negative reception from the Great Powers. Some historians argue that Ottoman atrocities were given wide coverage in Europe, while Greek atrocities tended to be suppressed or played down.&lt;ref&gt;Boime, ''Social History of Modern Art'', 195&lt;br /&gt;* Brown, ''International Politics and the Middle East'', 52&lt;br /&gt;* Schick, ''Christian Maidens, Turkish Ravishers'', 286&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman [[Chios Massacre|massacres at Chios]] in 1822 inspired [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s famous painting ''[[The Massacre at Chios|Massacre of Chios]]''; other philhellenic works by Delacroix were inspired by various Byron poems. Byron, the most celebrated philhellene of all, lent his name, prestige and wealth to the cause.&lt;ref&gt;Boime, ''Social History of Modern Art'', 194&lt;/ref&gt;

Byron organized funds and supplies (including the provision of several ships), but died from fever at [[Missolonghi]] in 1824. Byron's death helped to create an even stronger European sympathy for the Greek cause. His poetry, along with [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix's]] art, helped arouse European public opinion in favor of the Greek revolutionaries to the point of no return, and led Western powers to intervene directly.&lt;ref name="Br52"&gt;Brown, ''International Politics and the Middle East'', 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Philhellenism made a notable contribution to [[romanticism]], enabling the younger generation of artistic and literary intellectuals to expand the classical repertoire by treating modern Greek history as an extension of ancient history; the idea of a regeneration of the spirit of ancient Greece permeated the rhetoric of the Greek cause's supporters. Classicists and romantics of that period envisioned the casting out of the Turks as the prelude to the revival of the Golden Age.&lt;ref&gt;Boime, ''Social History of Modern Art'', 195–196&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AlexanderYpsilantisPruth.jpg|thumb|''Alexander Ypsilantis crosses the Pruth'', by [[Peter von Hess]] (Benaki Museum, Athens)]]

Alexander Ypsilantis was elected as the head of the Filiki Eteria in April 1820 and took upon himself the task of planning the insurrection. His intention was to raise all the Christians of the Balkans in rebellion and perhaps force Russia to intervene on their behalf. On 22 February {{smaller|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|N.S.]] 6&amp;nbsp;March]}}, he crossed the river [[Prut]] with his followers, entering the [[Danubian Principalities]].&lt;ref name="Clogg32"&gt;Clogg, ''A Concise History of Greece'', p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In order to encourage the local [[Romanians|Romanian]] Christians to join him, he announced that he had "the support of a Great Power", implying Russia. Two days after crossing the Prut, at [[Trei Ierarhi Monastery|Three Holy Hierarchs Monastery]] in [[Iași|Iaşi (Jassy)]], the capital of [[Moldavia]], Ypsilantis issued a proclamation calling all Greeks and Christians to rise up against the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Clogg32"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hitchins149-50"&gt;Hitchins, ''The Romanians'', 149–150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manastireasftreiierarhi.ro/en/history/ The Three Holy Hierarchs Monastery - A glimpse on its history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929144221/http://www.manastireasftreiierarhi.ro/en/history/ |date=29 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://curierul-iasi.ro/iasul-istoric-1821-eteria-pornea-de-la-iasi-8999 Iaşul istoric 1821 – Iaşi, Starting point of the Eteria] {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Soutzos]], then [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince of Moldavia]] and a member of Filiki Etaireia, set his guard at Ypsilantis' disposal. In the meanwhile, [[Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople]] and the Synod had anathematized and excommunicated both Ypsilantis and Soutzos issuing many encyclicals, an explicit denunciation of the Revolution in line with the Orthodox Church's policy.&lt;ref&gt;Clogg, ''Review'' pp. 251–252.&lt;br/&gt;* Koliopoulos &amp; Veremis, ''Greece: the Modern Sequel'', pp. 143–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of directly advancing on [[Brăila]], where he arguably could have prevented Ottoman armies from entering the Principalities, and where he might have forced Russia to accept a [[List of French phrases used by English speakers#F|fait accompli]], Ypsilantis remained in Iaşi and ordered the executions of several pro-Ottoman Moldavians. In [[Bucharest]], where he arrived in early April after some weeks delay, he decided that he could not rely on the [[Wallachia]]n [[Vladimirescu's Pandurs|Pandurs]] to continue their [[Oltenia]]n-based [[Wallachian uprising (1821)|revolt]] and assist the Greek cause. The Pandur leader was [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], who had already reached the outskirts of Bucharest on 16&amp;nbsp;March {{smaller|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|N.S.]] 28&amp;nbsp;March]}}. In Bucharest, the relations of the two men deteriorated dramatically; Vladimirescu's first priority was to assert his authority against the newly appointed prince [[Scarlat Callimachi (hospodar)|Scarlat Callimachi]], trying to maintain relations with both Russia and the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Hitchins149-50"/&gt;

At that point, Kapodistrias, the foreign minister of Russia, was ordered by [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] to send Ypsilantis a letter upbraiding him for misusing the mandate received from the Tsar; Kapodistrias announced to Ypsilantis that his name had been struck off the army list and that he was commanded to lay down arms. Ypsilantis tried to ignore the letter, but Vladimirescu took this as the end of his commitment to the Eteria. A conflict erupted inside his camp and Vladimirescu was tried and put to death by the Eteria on 26&amp;nbsp;May {{smaller|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|N.S.]] 7&amp;nbsp;June]}}. The loss of their Romanian allies, followed by an Ottoman intervention on Wallachian soil, sealed defeat for the Greek exiles and culminated in the disastrous [[Battle of Dragashani]] and the destruction of the [[Sacred Band (1821)|Sacred Band]] on 7&amp;nbsp;June {{smaller|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|N.S.]] 19&amp;nbsp;June]}}.&lt;ref name="Clogg33"&gt;Clogg, ''A Concise History of Greece'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Greek War of Independence (Year 1 events).svg|thumb|350px|Important events of the first year of the war]]

Alexander Ypsilantis, accompanied by his brother Nicholas and a remnant of his followers, retreated to [[Râmnicu Vâlcea]], where he spent some days negotiating with the Austrian authorities for permission to cross the frontier. Fearing that his followers might surrender him to the Turks, he gave out that Austria had declared war on Turkey, caused a [[Te Deum]] to be sung in [[Cozia Monastery]], and on pretext of arranging measures with the Austrian commander-in-chief, he crossed the frontier. However, the reactionary policies of the [[Holy Alliance]] were enforced by [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] and the country refused to give asylum for leaders of revolts in neighboring countries. Ypsilantis was kept in close confinement for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Paroulakis, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In Moldavia, the struggle continued for a while, under [[Giorgakis Olympios]] and [[Yiannis Pharmakis]], but by the end of the year the provinces had been pacified by the Ottomans.

The outbreak of the war was met by mass executions, pogrom-style attacks, the destruction of churches, and looting of Greek properties throughout the Empire. The most severe atrocities occurred in Constantinople, in what became known as the [[Constantinople Massacre of 1821]]. The Orthodox Patriarch [[Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople|Gregory V]] was executed on 22&amp;nbsp;April 1821 on the orders of the Sultan despite his opposition to the revolt, which caused outrage throughout Europe and resulted in increased support for the Greek rebels.&lt;ref name="Clogg2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Clogg|title=A Concise History of Greece|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5pyUIY4THYC|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=20 June 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00479-4|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peloponnese===
[[File:Panagiotis Kefalas by Hess.jpg|thumb|"Kephalas plants the flag of liberty upon the walls of Tripolizza" ([[Siege of Tripolitsa]]) by [[Peter von Hess]].]]

The [[Peloponnese]], with its long tradition of resistance to the Ottomans, was to become the heartland of the revolt. In the early months of 1821, with the absence of the Ottoman governor of the [[Morea]] (''Mora valisi'') [[Hursid Pasha]] and many of his troops, the situation was favourable for the Greeks to rise against Ottoman occupation. The crucial meeting was held at Vostitsa (modern [[Aigion]]), where chieftains and prelates from all over the Peloponnese assembled on 26&amp;nbsp;January. There, [[Papaflessas]], a pro-revolution priest who presented himself as representative of [[Filiki Eteria]] clashed with most of the civil leaders and members of the senior clergy, such as [[Germanos III of Old Patras|Metropolitan Germanos of Patras]], who were sceptical and demanded guarantees about a Russian intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Papageorgiou, "First Year of Freedom", p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Palaion Patron Germanos by Hess.jpg|thumb|"Bishop Germanos of Old Patras blessing the flag of Liberty", by Peter von Hess.]]
As news came of Ypsilantis' march into the Danubian Principalities, the atmosphere in the Peloponnese was tense, and by mid-March, sporadic incidents against Muslims occurred, heralding the start of the uprising. According to tradition and several contemporary sources, the Revolution was declared on 25&amp;nbsp;March 1821 ([[Gregorian Calendar|N.S.]] 6&amp;nbsp;April) by Metropolitan Germanos of Patras, who raised the banner with the cross in the Monastery of [[Agia Lavra]], although some historians question the historicity of the event.&lt;ref&gt;Frazee, ''The Orthodox Church and Independent Greece'', p. 19, who also cites (footnote 3) Germanos of Old Patras, ''Recollections of the Greek Revolution'', 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Some claim that the story first appears in 1824 in a book written by a French diplomat François Pouqueville, whose book is full of inventions.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 3"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The British historian David Brewer noted that Pouqueville was an Anglophobe, and in his account of the speech by Germanos in his book, Pouqueville has the Metropolitan denounce Britain in language that smacks more of French Anglophobia than anything that a Greek would say, and has him praise France as Greece's one true friend in the world, which led Brewer to conclude that Pouqueville had invented the entire story as a way to bash Britain.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 3"/&gt; However, a research on the archive of Hugues Pouqueville (François Pouqueville's brother, then Consul of France in Patras) kept in the French Ministry of External Affairs, claims that François' account is correct and is based on H. Pouqueville's diary.&lt;ref&gt;Mavrogiannis Dionyssios, "Aspects of civic, economic and social life in Achaia and Moreas at the beginning of the revolutionary process of 1821.

On 17 March 1821, war was declared on the Turks by the Maniots in [[Areopoli]]. The same day, a force of 2,000 Maniots under the command of [[Petros Mavromichalis]] advanced on the [[Messenia]]n town of [[Kalamata]], where they united with troops under [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]], [[Nikitaras]] and [[Papaflessas]]; Kalamata fell to the Greeks on 23 March.&lt;ref name="Kassis39"&gt;Kassis, ''Mani's History'', p. 39.&lt;br/&gt;* Papageorgiou, "First Year of Freedom", p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Achaea|Achaia]], the town of [[Kalavryta]] was besieged on 21 March, and in [[Patras]] conflicts lasted for many days. The Ottomans launched sporadic attacks towards the city while the revolutionaries, led by [[Panagiotis Karatzas]], drove them back to the fortress.&lt;ref&gt;Vakalopoulos, "The Great Greek Revolution", pp. 327–331&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of March, the Greeks effectively controlled the countryside, while the Turks were confined to the fortresses, most notably those of Patras (recaptured by the Turks on 3 April by Yussuf Pasha), [[Rio Castle|Rio]], [[Acrocorinth]], [[Monemvasia]], [[Nafplion]] and the provincial capital, [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]], where many Muslims had fled with their families at the beginning of the uprising. All these were loosely besieged by local irregular forces under their own captains, since the Greeks lacked artillery. With the exception of Tripolitsa, all sites had access to the sea and could be resupplied and reinforced by the Ottoman fleet. Since May, Kolokotronis organized the siege of Tripolitsa, and, in the meantime, Greek forces twice defeated the Turks, who unsuccessfully tried to repulse the besiegers. Finally, Tripolitsa was seized by the Greeks on 23 September {{smaller|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|N.S.]] 5&amp;nbsp;October]}},&lt;ref&gt;Kassis, ''Mani's History'', p. 39.&lt;br/&gt;* Papageorgiou, "First Year of Freedom", p. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; and the city was given over to the mob for two days.&lt;ref&gt;St. Clair, ''That Greece Might still Be Free'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; After lengthy negotiations, the Turkish forces surrendered Actrocorinth on 14 January 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Papageorgiou, "First Year of Freedom", p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Greece===

The first regions to revolt in [[Central Greece]] were [[Phocis]] (24 March) and [[Amfissa|Salona]] (27 March). In [[Boeotia]], [[Livadeia]] was captured by [[Athanasios Diakos]] on 31 March, followed by [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] two days later.

They would go out in parties of fifty to a hundred, mounted on fleet horses, and scour the open country in search of Greek peasantry, who might from necessity or hardihood have ventured down upon the plains. After capturing some, they would give the poor creatures a certain distance to start ahead, hoping to escape, and then try the speed of their horses in overtaking them, the accuracy of their pistols in firing at them as they ran, or the keenness of their sabres' edge in cutting off their heads".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Those not cut down or shot down during the "Greek hunts" were impaled afterwards when captured.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial Greek successes were soon put in peril after two subsequent defeats at the battles of [[Battle of Alamana|Alamana]] and Eleftherohori against the army of [[Omer Vrioni]]. Another significant loss for the Greeks was the death of Diakos, a promising military leader, who was captured in Alamana and executed by the Turks when he refused to declare allegiance to the Sultan. The Greeks managed to halt the Turkish advance at the [[Battle of Gravia]] under the leadership of [[Odysseas Androutsos]], who, with a handful of men, inflicted heavy casualties upon the Turkish army. After his defeat and the successful retreat of Androutsos' force, Omer Vrioni postponed his advance towards Peloponnese awaiting reinforcements; instead, he invaded Livadeia, which he captured on 10 June, and Athens, where he lifted the siege of the Acropolis. After a Greek force of 2,000 men managed to destroy at [[Battle of Vassilika|Vassilika]] a Turkish relief army on its way to Vrioni, the latter abandoned [[Attica]] in September and retreated to [[Ioannina]]. By the end of 1821, the revolutionaries had managed to temporarily secure their positions in Central Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Papageorgiou, "First Year of Freedom", p. 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ottoman reaction===
[[File:1821 attrocities Constantinople.jpg|thumb|[[Constantinople massacre of 1821|Atrocities]] against the Greek population of Constantinople, April 1821. [[Gregory V of Constantinople|Patriarch Gregory V]] was executed by the Ottoman authorities.]]

The news that the Greeks had revolted sparked murderous fury all over the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; In Constantinople, on Easter Sunday, the Patriarch of the Greek Orthodox Church, [[Gregory V of Constantinople|Gregory V]], was publicly hanged despite the fact that he had condemned the revolution and preached obedience to the Sultan in his sermons.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the revolution began in March, the [[Sublime Porte]] had executed at random various prominent Greeks living in Constantinople, such as a loyal [[Phanariot]] serving as a [[dragoman]], two retired dragoman, a number of wealthy bankers and merchants, including a member of the ultra-rich Mavrokordhatos family, three monks and a priest of the Orthodox church, and three ordinary Greeks accused of planning to poison the city's water supply.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 104.&lt;/ref&gt; In the city of [[Smyrna]] (modern İzmir, Turkey), which until 1922 was a mostly Greek city, Ottoman soldiers drawn from the interior of Anatolia on their way to fight in either Greece or Moldavia/Wallachia, staged a pogrom in June 1821 against the Greeks, leading Gordon to write: "3,000 ruffians assailed the Greek quarter, plundered the houses and slaughtered the people; Smyrna resembled a place taken by assault, neither age or sex being respected".&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 101"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 101.&lt;/ref&gt; When a local imam was asked to give a ''fatwa'' justifying the murder of Christians by Muslims and refused, he too was promptly killed under the grounds that he was not a proper Muslim.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 101"/&gt;

===International reaction===
[[File:President Jean-Pierre Boyer of Haiti (Hispaniola Unification Regime) Portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], President of [[Haiti]]. Haiti was the first independent state that recognised the revolution.]]

The news of the revolution was greeted with dismay by the conservative leaders of Europe, committed to upholding the system established at the Congress of Vienna, but was greeted with enthusiasm by many ordinary people across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 135-137.&lt;/ref&gt; After the execution of the Patriarch Gregory V, the Russian Emperor Alexander I broke off diplomatic relations with the Sublime Porte after his foreign minister Count [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] sent an ultimatum demanding promises from the Ottomans to stop executing Orthodox priests, which the Porte did not see fit to answer.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 107.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1821, various young men from all Europe began to gather in the French port of [[Marseilles]] to book a passage to Greece and join the revolution.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 137"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 137.&lt;/ref&gt; The French philhellene [[Jean-François-Maxime Raybaud]] wrote when he heard of the revolution in March 1821, "I learnt with a thrill that Greece was shaking off her chains" and in July 1821 boarded a ship going to Greece.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 137"/&gt; Between the summer of 1821 and end of 1822, when the French started to inspect ships leaving Marseilles for philhellenes, some 360 volunteers travelled to Greece.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 138"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 138.&lt;/ref&gt; From the United States came the doctor [[Samuel Gridley Howe]] and the soldier [[George Jarvis (Philhellene)|George Jarvis]] to fight with the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'' London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 241.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest contingents came from the German states, France and the Italian states.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 138"/&gt; In [[Nafplio]], a monument to honor the philhellenes who died fighting in the war listed 274 names, of which 100 are from Germany, forty each from France and Italy, and the rest from Britain, Spain, Hungary, Sweden, Portugal and Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, Italy and France many clergyman and university professors gave speeches saying all of Europe owed a huge debt to [[ancient Greece]], that the modern Greeks were entitled to call upon the classical heritage as a reason for support, and that Greece would only achieve progress with freedom from the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 138"/&gt; A young medical student in [[Mannheim]] wrote that hearing his professor lecture on the need for Greek freedom went through him like an electric shock, inspiring him to drop his studies and head to Greece, while a Danish student wrote: "How could a man inclined to fight for freedom and justice find a better place than next to the oppressed Greeks?".&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 138"/&gt; In France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, the United States and many other places "Greek committees" were established to raise funds and supplies for the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 139&lt;/ref&gt; The classicist [[Edward Everett]], a professor of Greek at Harvard, was active in championing the Greek cause in the United States and in November 1821 published an appeal from Adhamantios Korais reading "To the Citizens of the United States, it is your land that Liberty has fixed her abode, so you will not assuredly imitate the culpable indifference or rather the long ingratitude of the Europeans", going on to call for American intervention, in several American newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'' London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 141.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821, the Greek committee in Charleston, South Carolina sent the Greeks 50 barrels of salted meat while the Greek Committee in Springfield, Massachusetts sent supplies of salted meat, sugar, fish and flour.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 141"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers in the United States gave the war much coverage and were overwhelmingly pro-Greek in their stance, which explains why American public opinion was so supportive.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 141"/&gt; In New York City, one ball put on by the Greek committee raised $8,000.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 141"/&gt; In Russia, the St. Petersburg Greek committee under Prince Alexander Golitsyn had raised 973, 500 roubles by August 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 142.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, millions of roubles had been fund-raised in Russia for the relief of refugees and to buy Greeks enslaved freedom (though the government forbade buying arms for the Greeks), but no Russian is known to have gone to fight with the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'' London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 142-144.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Haiti]] was the first government of an independent state to recognise the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gr/en/blog/greece-bilateral-relations/haiti/ Hellenic Republic - Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Haiti]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], President of Haiti, following a Greek request for assistance, addressed a letter on 15 January 1822. In the letter sent to Greek expatriates living in France, [[Adamantios Korais]], Christodoulos Klonaris, Christodoulos Klonaris, Konstantinos Polychroniades and A. Bogorides, who had assembled themselves into a Committee which was seeking international support for the ongoing Greek revolution, expressed his support for the Greek Revolution and compared the struggle underfoot across the Atlantic to the struggle for independence in [[Haitian Revolution|his own land]]. He apologized for being unable to support the Revolution in Greece financially, though he hoped he might be able to in the future. But he articulated his moral and political support for the revolution, notably by filling his letter with references to classical Greek history, demonstrating a detailed knowledge of this history and powerfully evoking the contemporary revolutionaries as the rightful heirs of their ancestors.&lt;ref name="Letter from Jean-Pierre Boyer to Greek Revolutionaries"&gt;[https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1149177831/a-letter-from-jean-pierre-boyer-to-greek-revolutionaries A Letter from Jean-Pierre Boyer to Greek Revolutionaries]&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians claim that Boyer also sent to the Greeks 25 tons of Haitian coffee that could be sold and the proceeds used to purchase weapons, but not enough evidence exists to support this or the other claim that one hundred Haitian volunteers set off to fight in the Greek Revolution. Allegedly, their ship was boarded by pirates somewhere in the Mediterranean and these fighters purportedly never reached their destination.&lt;ref name="neoskosmos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neoskosmos.com/news/en/haiti-and-the-greek-revolution|publisher=neoskosmos.com|title=Haiti and the Greek revolution &amp;#124; Neos Kosmos|accessdate=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of Kalamata, the Messenian Senate, the first of the Greeks' local governing councils, held its inaugural session. At almost the same time, the Achean Directorate was summoned in Patras, but its members were soon forced to flee to Kalavryta. With the initiative of the Messenian Senate, a Peloponnesian assembly convened, and elected a Senate on 26 May. Most of the members of the Peloponnesian Senate were local notables (lay and ecclesiastical) or persons controlled by them. The three major social groups that provided the leadership of the revolution were the primates (wealthy landowners who controlled about a third of the arable land in the Peloponnese), the captains drawn from the ''klephts'' and/or ''armatolos'' (''klepts'' and ''armatolos'' tended to alternate), and the wealthy merchants, who were the most Westernised elements in Greek society.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 126-127&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more prominent leaders of the merchants and a "Westerniser" was the Phanariot [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]] who was living with the poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and his wife [[Mary Shelley]] in Pisa when the revolution began, and upon hearing of the revolution, purchased supplies and a ship in Marseilles and then set sail for Greece.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 127"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Mavrokordhatos's wealth, education (he was fluent in seven languages) and his experience as an Ottoman official ruling Wallachia led many to look towards him as a leader.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 127"/&gt;  When [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] arrived in Peloponnese as official representative of Filiki Eteria, he tried to assume control of the Revolution's affairs, and he thus proposed a new system of electing the members of the Senate, which was supported by the military leaders, but opposed by the notables.{{cref|vi}} Assemblies convened also in Central Greece (November 1821) under the leadership of two Phanariots: [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]] in the western part, and [[Theodoros Negris]] in the eastern part. These assemblies adopted two [[Greek local statutes|local statutes]], the Charter of Western Continental Greece and the Legal Order of Eastern Continental Greece, drafted mainly by Mavrokordatos and Negris respectively. The statutes provided for the creation of two local administrative organs in Central Greece, an [[Areopagus of Eastern Continental Greece|Areopagus]] in the east, and a [[Senate of Western Continental Greece|Senate]] in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Koliopoulos &amp; Veremis, ''Greece: the Modern Sequel'', pp. 14–17.&lt;br/&gt;* Papageorgiou, "First Year of Freedom", pp. 67–70.&lt;/ref&gt; The three local statutes were recognized by the [[First National Assembly at Epidaurus|First National Assembly]], but the respective administrative institutions were turned into administrative branches of the central government. They were later dissolved by the [[Second National Assembly at Astros|Second National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Koliopoulos &amp; Veremis, ''Greece: the Modern Sequel'', pp. 19–20.&lt;br/&gt;* Theodoridis, "A Modern State", pp. 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolutionary activity in Crete, Macedonia and Cyprus===

====Crete====
[[File:Hatzimichalis Dalianis.JPG|thumb|[[Hatzimichalis Dalianis]], commander of the campaign to Crete, was killed in Frangokastello in 1828.]]

Cretan participation in the revolution was extensive, but it failed to achieve liberation from Turkish rule because of Egyptian intervention.&lt;ref name="Detorakis375"&gt;Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crete]] had a long history of resisting Turkish rule, exemplified by the folk hero [[Daskalogiannis]], who was killed while fighting the Turks.&lt;ref name="Detorakis375"/&gt; In 1821, an uprising by Christians was met with a fierce response from the Ottoman authorities and the execution of several bishops, regarded as ringleaders.&lt;ref&gt;Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the Turkish reaction the rebellion persisted, and thus Sultan [[Mahmud II]] (r. 1808–1839) was forced to seek the aid of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], trying to lure him with the ''pashalik'' of Crete.&lt;ref name="Detorakis375"/&gt; On 28&amp;nbsp;May 1822, an Egyptian fleet of 30 warships and 84 transports arrived at [[Souda Bay]] led by Hasan Pasha, Mehmet Ali's son-in-law; he was tasked with ending the rebellion and did not waste any time in the burning of villages throughout Crete.&lt;ref name="Detorakis375"/&gt;

After Hasan's accidental death in February 1823, another son-in-law of Muhammad Ali of Egypt, Hussein [[Bey]],&lt;ref&gt;Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; led a well-organised and well-armed joint Turkish-Egyptian force of 12,000 soldiers with the support of artillery and cavalry. On 22&amp;nbsp;June 1823, [[Emmanouil Tombazis]], appointed Commissioner of Crete by the Greek revolutionary government, held the Convention of Arcoudaina in an attempt to reconcile the factions of local captains and unite them against the common threat.&lt;ref&gt;Krimbas, ''Greek Auditors'', 155&lt;/ref&gt; He then gathered 3,000 men in [[Gergeri]] to face Hussein, but the Cretans were defeated by the much larger and better-organised force, and lost 300 men at the battle of Amourgelles on 20&amp;nbsp;August 1823.&lt;ref&gt;Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; By the spring of 1824, Hussein had managed to limit the Cretan resistance to just a few mountain enclaves.&lt;ref&gt;St. Clair, ''That Greece Might still Be Free'', 227&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frangokastello 3.jpg|thumb|240px|left|View of the [[Frangokastello]] castle.]]

Towards the summer of 1825, a body of three to four hundred Cretans, who had fought with other Greeks in the Peloponnese, arrived in Crete and revitalized the Cretan insurgency (the so-called "Gramvousa period"). On 9&amp;nbsp;August 1825, led by Dimitrios Kallergis and Emmanouil Antoniadis, this group of Cretans captured the fort at [[Gramvousa]] and other insurgents captured the fort at [[Kissamos]], and attempted to spread the insurgency further afield.&lt;ref&gt;Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Ottomans did not manage to retake the forts, they were successful in blocking the spread of the insurgency to the island's western provinces. The insurgents were besieged in Gramvousa for more than two years and they had to resort to piracy to survive. Gramvousa became a hive of piratical activity that greatly affected Turkish–Egyptian and European shipping in the region. During that period the population of Gramvousa became organised and built a school and a church dedicated to the ''Panagia i Kleftrina'' ("Our Lady the piratess")—St Mary as the patron of the [[klepht]]s.&lt;ref name="Detorakis383"&gt;Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1828, the [[Epirus|Epirote]] [[Hatzimichalis Dalianis]] landed in Crete with 700 men and in the following March took possession of [[Frangokastello]], a castle in the [[Sfakia]] region. Soon the local Ottoman ruler, [[Mustafa Naili Pasha]], attacked Frangokastello with an army of 8,000 men. The castle's defence was doomed after a seven-day siege and Dalianis perished along with 385 men.&lt;ref name=Bakker&gt;{{cite book |last=Bakker|first=Johan de |title=Across Crete: From Khania to Herakleion |publisher=I.B.Tauris |pages=82–83 |ref=|isbn=978-1-85043-387-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bDQJ5ubpxzcC&amp;dq= |date=18 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1828, Kapodistrias sent Mavrocordatos with British and French fleets to Crete to deal with the klephts and the pirates. This expedition resulted in the destruction of all pirate ships at Gramvousa and the fort came under British command.&lt;ref name="Detorakis383"/&gt;

====Macedonia====
[[File:Letter from Alexandros Ipsilantis to Emmanouil Papas.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Letter of [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792–1828)|Alexander Ypsilantis]] to [[Emmanouel Pappas]], dated 8 October 1820]]

The economic ascent of [[Thessaloniki]] and of the other urban centres of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] coincided with the cultural and political renaissance of the Greeks. The ideals and patriotic songs of Rigas Feraios and others had made a profound impression upon the Thessalonians. Α few years later, the revolutionary fervour of the southern Greeks was to spread to these parts, and the seeds of Filiki Eteria were speedily to take root. The leader and coordinator of the revolution in Macedonia was [[Emmanouel Pappas]] from the village of [[Emmanouil Pappas|Dobista]], [[Serres (regional unit)|Serres]], who was initiated into the Filiki Eteria in 1819. Pappas had considerable influence over the local Ottoman authorities, especially the local governor, Ismail Bey, and offered much of his personal wealth for the cause.&lt;ref&gt;Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia''&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the instructions of Alexander Ypsilantis, that is to prepare the ground and to rouse the inhabitants of Macedonia to rebellion, Pappas loaded arms and munitions from Constantinople on a ship on 23 March and proceeded to [[Mount Athos]], considering that this would be the most suitable spring-board for starting the insurrection. As Vacalopoulos notes, however, "adequate preparations for rebellion had not been made, nor were revolutionary ideals to be reconciled with the ideological world of the monks within the Athonite regime".&lt;ref&gt;Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', p.592&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 May, the Turks, infuriated by the landing of sailors from [[Psara]] at [[Stomio, Larissa|Tsayezi]], by the capture of Turkish merchants and the seizure of their goods, rampaged through the streets of Serres, searched the houses of the notables for arms, imprisoned the Metropolitan and 150 merchants, and seized their goods as a reprisal for the plundering by the Psarians.&lt;ref&gt;Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&amp;nbsp;594–595&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thessaloniki, governor Yusuf Bey (the son of Ismail Bey) imprisoned in his headquarters more than 400 hostages, of whom more than 100 were monks from the monastic estates. He also wished to seize the powerful notables of [[Polygyros]], who got wind of his intentions and fled. On 17 May, the Greeks of Polygyros took up arms, killed the local governor and 14 of his men, and wounded three others; they also repulsed two Turkish detachments. On 18 May, when Yusuf learned of the incidents at Polygyros and the spreading of the insurrection to the villages of [[Chalkidiki]], he ordered half of his hostages to be slaughtered before his eyes. The Mulla of Thessalonica, Hayrıülah, gives the following description of Yusuf's retaliations:
{{quote|Every day and every night you hear nothing in the streets of Thessaloniki but shouting and moaning. It seems that Yusuf Bey, the ''Yeniceri Agasi'', the ''Subaşı'', the ''hocas'' and the ''ulemas'' have all gone raving mad.&lt;ref&gt;Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&amp;nbsp;595–596&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:EmmanouilPapas.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of [[Emmanouel Pappas]] in [[Athens]]]]

It would take until the end of the century for the city's Greek community to recover.&lt;ref&gt;Mazower, ''Salonica, City of Ghosts'', pp. 132–139&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt, however, gained momentum in Mount Athos and [[Kassandra, Chalkidiki|Kassandra]], and the island of [[Thasos]] joined it.&lt;ref&gt;Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&amp;nbsp;601–603&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the revolt in Chalkidiki was progressing slowly and unsystematically. In June 1821 the insurgents tried to cut communications between [[Thrace]] and the south, attempting to prevent the ''[[serasker]]'' Hadji Mehmet Bayram Pasha from transferring forces from Asia Minor to southern Greece. Even though the rebels delayed him, they were ultimately defeated at the pass of [[Rentina, Thessaloniki|Rentina]].&lt;ref&gt;Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', p.609&lt;/ref&gt;

The insurrection in Chalkidiki was, from then on, confined to the peninsulas of Mount Athos and Kassandra. On 30 October 1821, an offensive led by the new Pasha of Thessaloniki, Mehmet Emin Abulubud, resulted in a decisive Ottoman victory at Kassandra. The survivors, among them Pappas, were rescued by the Psarian fleet, which took them mainly to [[Skiathos]], [[Skopelos]] and [[Skyros]]. However, Pappas died en route to join the revolution at [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]]. [[Sithonia]], Mount Athos and Thasos subsequently surrendered on terms.&lt;ref&gt;Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&amp;nbsp;615–619&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the revolt spread from [[central Macedonia|Central]] to [[Western Macedonia]], from [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] to [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]] and [[Vermion Mountains|Vermion]]. In the autumn of 1821, Nikolaos Kasomoulis was sent to southern Greece as the "representative of South-East Macedonia", and met Demetrius Ypsilantis. He then wrote to Papas from Hydra, asking him to visit Olympus to meet the captains there and to "fire them with the required patriotic enthusiasm".&lt;ref&gt;Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&amp;nbsp;627–628&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 1822, [[Anastasios Karatasos]] and [[Aggelis Gatsos]] arranged a meeting with other ''armatoloi''; they decided that the insurrection should be based on three towns: [[Naousa, Imathia|Naoussa]], [[Kastania (Pieria), Greece|Kastania]], and [[Siatista]].&lt;ref&gt;Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&amp;nbsp;628–629&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1822, Mehmed Emin secured decisive victories at [[Kolindros]] and Kastania.&lt;ref&gt;Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&amp;nbsp;633–636&lt;/ref&gt; Further north, in the vicinity of Naousa, [[Zafeirakis Theodosiou]], Karatasos and Gatsos organized the city's defense, and the first clashes resulted in a victory for the Greeks. Mehmed Emin then appeared before the town with 10,000 regular troops and 10,600 irregulars. Failing to get the insurgents to surrender, Mehmed Emin launched a number of attacks pushing them further back and finally captured Naousa in April, helped by the enemies of Zafeirakis, who had revealed an unguarded spot, the "Alonia".&lt;ref&gt;Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&amp;nbsp;635–637&lt;/ref&gt; Reprisals and executions ensued, and women are reported to have flung themselves over the Arapitsa waterfall to avoid dishonor and being sold in slavery. Those who broke through the siege of Naousa fell back in [[Kozani]], Siatista and [[Aspropotamos River]], or were carried by the Psarian fleet to the [[northern Aegean]] islands.&lt;ref&gt;Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&amp;nbsp;638–639&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyprus====
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Kanaris Konstantinos - Greek Fighter.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Konstantinos Kanaris]]]]

On 9 June 1821 3 ships sailed from Cyprus with General [[Konstantinos Kanaris]]. They landed at Asprovrisi, of Lapithou. Kanaris brought with him papers from the Filiki Etaireia, and the ships were welcomed with rapturous applause and patriotic cries from the local Greeks of the area, who helped Kanaris and the soldiers from Cyprus as much as they could.

Kanaris brought with him the Cypriots who created the "Column of Cypriots" («Φάλαγγα των Κυπρίων»), led by General Chatzipetros, which fought with extraordinary heroism in Greece. In total, over 1000 Cypriots fought in the War of Independence, many of whom died. At Missolonghi many were killed, and at the Battle of Athens in 1827, around 130 were killed. General Chatzipetros, showing military decorations declared "These were given to me by the heroism and braveness of the Column of Cypriots". In the National Library, there is a list of 580 names of Cypriots who fought in the War between 1821 and 1829.

The Cypriot battalion brought with them their own distinctive war banner, consisting of a white flag with a large blue cross, and the words ''GREEK FLAG OF THE MOTHERLAND CYPRUS'' emblazoned in the top left corner. The flag was hoisted on a wooden mast, carved and pointed at the end to act as a lance in battle. The legendary battle flag is currently stored at the National Historical Museum of Athens.

Throughout the War of Independence, supplies were brought from Cyprus by the Filiki Etairia to aid the Greek struggle. The Greeks of Cyprus underwent great risk to provide these supplies, and secretly load them onto boats arriving at intervals from Greece, as the Ottoman Rulers in Cyprus at the time were very wary of Cypriot insurgency and sentenced to death any Greek Cypriots found aiding the Greek cause. Incidences of these secret loading trips from Cyprus were recorded by the French consul to Cyprus, Mechain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.synexelixi.org/el/component/content/article/60-kypros-1821 |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325235958/http://www.synexelixi.org/el/component/content/article/60-kypros-1821 |archive-date=25 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Cyprus during the war, the local population suffered greatly at the hands of the Ottoman rulers of the islands, who were quick to act with great severity at acts of patriotism and sympathy of the Greeks of Cyprus to the Revolution, fearing a similar uprising in Cyprus. The leader of the Greeks of the island at the time, [[Archbishop Kyprianos]] was initiated into the Filiki Etairia in 1818 and had promised to aid the cause of the Greek Elladites with food and money.

In early July 1821, the Cypriot Archimandrite Theofylaktos Thiseas arrived in [[Larnaca]] as a messenger of the Filiki Etairia, bringing orders to Kyprianos, while proclamations were distributed in every corner of the island. However, the local pasha, [[Küçük Mehmet]], intercepted these messages and reacted with fury, calling in reinforcements, confiscating weapons and arresting several prominent Cypriots. Archbishop Kyprianos was urged (by his friends) to leave the island as the situation worsened but refused to do so.

On 9 July 1821 Küçük Mehmet had the gates to the walled city of Nicosia closed and executed, by beheading or hanging, 470 important Cypriots amongst them Chrysanthos (bishop of Paphos), Meletios (bishop of Kition) and Lavrentios of (bishop of Kyrenia). The next day, all abbots and monks of monasteries of Cyprus were executed. In addition, the Ottomans arrested all the Greek leaders of the villages and imprisoned them before executing them, as they were suspected of inspiring patriotism in their local population.

In total, it is estimated that over 2,000 Greeks of Cyprus were slaughtered as an act of revenge for participating in the revolution. This was a very significant proportion of the total population of the island at the time. Küçük Mehmet had declared ''"I have in my mind to slaughter the Greeks in Cyprus, to hang them, to not leave a soul..."'' before undertaking these massacres. From 9 to 14 July, the Ottomans killed all prisoners on the list of the pasha, and in the next 30 days, looting and massacres spread throughout Cyprus as 4,000 Turkish soldiers from Syria arrived on the island.

Archbishop Kyprianos was defiant in his death. He was aware of his fate and impending death, yet stood by the Greek cause. He is revered throughout Cyprus as a noble patriot and defender of the Orthodox faith and Hellenic cause. An English explorer by the name of Carne spoke to the Archbishop before the events of 9 July, who was quoted as saying: "My death is not far away. I know they [the Ottoman] are waiting for an opportunity to kill me". Kyprianos chose to stay, despite these fears, and provide protection and counsel for the people of Cyprus as their leader.

He was publicly hanged from a tree opposite the former palace of the Lusignan Kings of Cyprus on 19 July 1821. The events leading up to his execution were documented in an epic poem written in the Cypriot dialect by [[Vassilis Michaelides]].

===War at sea===
[[File:Aris figurehead of Tsamadoy ship.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[figurehead]] of [[Anastasios Tsamados]]’ famous brig [[Greek brig Aris|Aris]], today in the [[National Historical Museum, Athens]].]]

From the early stages of the revolution, success at sea was vital for the Greeks. When they failed to counter the [[Ottoman Navy]], it was able to resupply the isolated Ottoman garrisons and land reinforcements from the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s provinces, theatening to crush the rebellion; likewise the failure of the Greek fleet to break the naval blocade of Missolonghi (as it did several times earlier) in 1826 led to the fall of the city.

The Greek fleet was primarily outfitted by prosperous Aegean islanders, principally from three islands: [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]], [[Spetses]] and [[Psara]]. Each island equipped, manned and maintained its own squadron, under its own admiral.&lt;ref name="Brewer, pp. 89–91"&gt;Brewer, pp. 89–91.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were manned by experienced crews, the Greek ships were not designed for warfare, equipped with only light guns and staffed by armed merchantmen.&lt;ref name="Brewer, pp. 89–91"/&gt; Against them stood the Ottoman fleet, which enjoyed several advantages: its ships and supporting craft were built for war; it was supported by the resources of the vast Ottoman Empire; command was centralized and disciplined under the [[Kapudan Pasha]]. The total Ottoman fleet size consisted of 20 three-masted [[ship of the line|ships of the line]], each with about 80 guns and 7 or 8 [[frigate]]s with 50 guns, 5 corvettes with about 30 guns and around 40 [[brig]]s with 20 or fewer guns.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Κωνσταντίνος Βολανάκης - Το κάψιμο της τουρκικής φρεγάτας.jpg|thumb|240px|"The burning of the Ottoman frigate at Eressos by [[Dimitrios Papanikolis]]" by [[Konstantinos Volanakis]]]]

In the face of this situation, the Greeks decided to use [[fire ship]]s ({{lang-el|πυρπολικά or μπουρλότα}}), which had proven themselves effective for the Psarians during the [[Orlov Revolt]] in 1770. The first test was made at [[Eresos]] on 27 May 1821, when an Ottoman frigate was successfully destroyed by a fire ship under [[Dimitrios Papanikolis]]. In the fire ships, the Greeks found an effective weapon against the Ottoman vessels. In subsequent years, the successes of the Greek fire ships would increase their reputation, with acts such as the destruction of the Ottoman flagship by [[Constantine Kanaris]] at [[Chios]], after the [[Chios Massacre|massacre of the island's population in June 1822]], acquiring international fame. {{citation needed span|Overall, 59 fire ship attacks were carried out, of which 39 were successful.|date=August 2017}}

At the same time, conventional naval actions were also fought, at which naval commanders like [[Andreas Vokos Miaoulis|Andreas Miaoulis]] distinguished themselves. The early successes of the Greek fleet in direct confrontations with the Ottomans at Patras and Spetses gave the crews confidence and contributed greatly to the survival and success of the uprising in the Peloponnese.

Later, however, as Greece became embroiled in a civil war, the Sultan called upon his strongest subject, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], for aid. Plagued by internal strife and financial difficulties in keeping the fleet in constant readiness, the Greeks failed to prevent the capture and destruction of [[Kasos]] and [[Destruction of Psara|Psara]] in 1824, or the landing of the Egyptian army at [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]]. Despite victories at [[Samos Island|Samos]] and Gerontas, the Revolution was threatened with collapse until the intervention of the Great Powers in the [[Battle of Navarino]] in 1827.

==1822–1824==
[[File:Solomos portrait 3.jpg|thumb|[[Dionysios Solomos]] wrote in 1823 the ''[[Hymn to Liberty]]'', which later became the National Greek anthem.]]

Revolutionary activity was fragmented because of the lack of strong central leadership and guidance. However, the Greek side withstood the Turkish attacks, because, during the same period, the Ottoman military campaigns were periodic, and the Ottoman presence in the rebel areas uncoordinated due to logistical problems. The cash-strapped Ottoman state, whose always difficult relations with Russia had been made worse by the hanging the Patriarch Grigorios, and the Sublime Porte needed to concentrate substantial forces on borders with Russia in case war should break out.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 188"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 188.&lt;/ref&gt; From October 1820 to July 1823, the Ottomans were at war with Persia, and in March 1823 a huge fire at the Tophana military arsenal in Constantinople destroyed much of the Ottoman state's supplies of ammunition and its main cannon foundry.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 188"/&gt; Short of men and money, the Ottoman state turned to hiring Albanian tribesmen to fight the Greeks, and by 1823, the bulk of the Ottoman forces in Greece were Albanian mercenaries hired for a campaigning season rather than the Ottoman Army.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 188"/&gt; The Albanian tribesmen, whose style of war was very similar to the Greeks, fought only for money and were liable to go home when not paid or able to plunder in lieu of pay.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 188"/&gt; The Greek military leaders preferred battlefields where they could annihilate the numerical superiority of the opponent, and, at the same time, the lack of artillery hampered Ottoman military efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Tzakis, "The Military Events", pp. 73–78&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 April 1822, the Ottoman fleet, under the Kapitan Pasha, Kara Ali, arrived on the island of [[Chios]].&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman sailors and soldiers promptly went on a rampage, killing and raping without mercy, as one contemporary recalled: "Mercy was out of the question, the victors butchering indiscriminately all who came in their way; shrieks rent the air, and the streets were strewn with the dead bodies of old men, women, and children; even the inmates of the hospital, the madhouse and deaf and dumb institution, were inhumanely slaughtered".&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Before Kara Ali's fleet had arrived, Chios had between 100,000 and 120,000 Greeks living there, of which some 25,000 were killed in the massacre, with another 45,000 (mostly women and children) sold into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chios massacre]] shocked all of Europe and further increased public sympathy for the Greek cause.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 166-167.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks avenged the massacre on the night of 18 June 1822, when the Ottoman fleet were busy celebrating the end of the sacred Muslim holiday of Ramadan, which the Greek fleet under Admiral [[Konstantinos Kanaris]] and Andreas Pipinos took advantage of to launch a fire ship attack.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 163-164.&lt;/ref&gt; As Kara Ali's ship was brightly lit as befitting the Kapitan Pasha, a fire ship under Kanaris was able to strike his ship, causing the Ottoman flagship to blow up.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 164"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 2,286 or so aboard the flagship, only 180 survived, but unfortunately many of the dead were Chians enslaved by Kara Ali, who was planning on selling them on the slave markets when he reached Constantinople.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 164"/&gt; In July 1822, the Greeks and philhellenes at the [[Battle of Peta]] under [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]] inflicted much punishment on an Ottoman army commanded by [[Omer Vrioni]], but reflecting the chronic factionalism and disunity that characterized the Greek war effort, were undone when one of the Greek captains, Gogos Bakolas betrayed his own side to the Ottomans, allowing Albanian infantry to advance up the ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 149-150&lt;/ref&gt; The battle ended in an Ottoman victory, and with most of the philhellenes killed.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The successive military campaigns of the Ottomans in Western and Eastern Greece were repulsed: in 1822, [[Mahmud Dramali Pasha]] crossed Roumeli and invaded Morea, but suffered a serious defeat in the [[Battle of Dervenakia|Dervenakia]].&lt;ref&gt;Dakin, ''The Greek Struggle for independence'', pp. 96–8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]], who annihilated Dramali Pasha's army at Dervenakia, became the hero of the hour, attracting much praise all over Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dramalis Expedition at Argos by Isaias.jpg|thumb|"Expedition of [[Mahmud Dramali Pasha]] at Argos" by Alexandros Isaias]]

The Greek government had been desperately short of money since the start of the revolution, and in February 1823, the banker Andréas Louriótis arrived in London, seeking a loan from the City.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Assisted by the London Greek Committee, which included several MPs and intellectuals, Louriótis began to lobby the City for a loan.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 221"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 221.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the British philhellenes, Edward Blaquiere, issued a report in September 1823 which grossly exaggerated Greece's wealth and claimed that once independent, Greece would easily become "one of the most opulent nations of Europe".&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 221"/&gt; Blaquiere further assisted the campaign by publishing two books in 1824, in which he claimed: "I should have no hesitation whatever in estimating the physical strength of regenerated Greece to be fully equal to the whole South American continent", concluding there was "no part of the world...with a more productive soil or happier climate than Greece...Of all the countries or governments who have borrowed money in London within the last ten years...Greece possesses the surest and most ample means of re-payment".&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1823 campaign in Western Greece was led by [[Mustafa Reshit Pasha]] and Omer Vrioni. During the summer the [[Souliot]] [[Markos Botsaris]] was shot dead at the [[Battle of Karpenisi]] in his attempt to stop the advance of the Ottomans;&lt;ref&gt;Dakin, ''The Greek Struggle for independence'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; the announcement of his death in Europe generated a wave of sympathy for the Greek cause. The campaign ended after the [[Second Siege of Missolonghi]] in December 1823. In February 1824, the loan for Greece was floated in the City, attracting some £472, 000 pounds sterling, which was money that the Greeks badly needed.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infighting===
{{details|Greek civil wars of 1824–1825}}
{{double image|right|Londos2.jpg|145|Kolokotronis Theodore.JPG|167|[[Andreas Londos]] (left) and [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] (right) were opponents during the first civil war, when the Peloponnesians were divided. They allied themselves during the second and bloodiest phase of the infighting.}}

The First National Assembly was formed at [[Epidaurus]] in late December 1821, consisting almost exclusively of Peloponnesian notables. The Assembly drafted the [[Greek Constitution of 1822|first Greek Constitution]] and appointed the members of an executive and a legislative body that were to govern the liberated territories. Mavrokordatos saved the office of president of the executive for himself, while Ypsilantis, who had called for the Assembly, was elected president of the legislative body, a place of limited significance.&lt;ref&gt;Dakin, ''The Greek Struggle for independence'', pp. 87–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military leaders and representatives of Filiki Eteria were marginalized, but gradually Kolokotronis' political influence grew, and he soon managed to control, along with the captains he influenced, the Peloponnesian Senate. The central administration tried to marginalize Kolokotronis, who also had under his control the fort of [[Nafplion]]. In November 1822, the central administration decided that the new National Assembly would take place in Nafplion, and asked Kolokotronis to return the fort to the government. Kolokotronis refused, and the Assembly was finally gathered in March 1823 in [[Astros, Greece|Astros]]. Central governance was strengthened at the expense of regional bodies, a [[Greek Constitution of 1823|new constitution]] was voted, and new members were elected for the executive and the legislative bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Rotzokos, "Civil Wars", 143–151&lt;/ref&gt;

Trying to coax the military leaders, the central administration proposed to Kolokotronis that he participate in the executive body as vice-president. Kolokotronis accepted, but he caused a serious crisis when he prevented Mavrokordatos, who had been elected president of the legislative body, from assuming his position. His attitude towards Mavrokordatos caused outrage amongst the members of the legislative body.&lt;ref&gt;Rotzokos, "Civil Wars", 152–154&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis culminated when the legislature, which was controlled by the Roumeliotes and the Hydriots, overturned the executive, and fired its president, Petros Mavromichalis. Kolokotronis and most of the Peloponnesian notables and captains supported Mavromichalis, who remained president of his executive in Tripolitsa. However, a second executive, supported by the islanders, the Roumeliotes, and some Achaean notables—[[Andreas Zaimis]] and [[Andreas Londos]] were the most prominent—was formed at [[Kranidi]] with [[Georgios Kountouriotis|Kountouriotis]] as president.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Dimitropoulos, ''Theodoros Kolokotronis'', 79–81&lt;br/&gt;* Rotzokos, "Civil Wars", 154–161&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1824, the forces of the new executive besieged Nafplion and Tripolitsa. After one month of fighting and negotiations, an agreement was reached between Kolokotronis, from one side, and Londos and Zaimis, from the other side. On 22 May, the first phase of the civil war officially ended, but most of the members of the new executive were displeased by the moderate terms of the agreement that Londos and Zaimis brokered.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

During this period, the two first installments of the English loan had arrived, and the position of the government was strengthened; but the infighting was not yet over. Zaimis and the other Peloponnesians who supported Kountouriotis came into conflict with the executive body, and allied with Kolokotronis, who roused the residents of Tripolitsa against the local tax collectors of the government. Papaflessas and Makriyannis failed to suppress the rebellion, but Kolokotronis remained inactive for some period, overwhelmed by the death of his son, Panos.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Dimitropoulos, ''Theodoros Kolokotronis'', 79–81&lt;br/&gt;* Rotzokos, "Civil Wars", 164–170.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government regrouped its armies, which now consisted mainly of Roumeliotes and Souliotes, led by [[Ioannis Kolettis]], who wanted a complete victory. Under Kolettis' orders, two bodies of Roumeliotes and Souliotes invaded the Peloponnese: the first under Gouras occupied [[Corinth]] and raided the province; the second under Karaiskakis, [[Kitsos Tzavelas]] and others, attacked in Achaea, Lindos and "Zaimis". In January 1825, a Roumeliote force, led by Kolettis himself, arrested Kolokotronis, Deligiannis' family and others. In May 1825, under the pressure of the Egyptian intervention, those imprisoned were released and granted amnesty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

On 19 July 1824, the largest fleet seen in the Mediterranean since Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798 set sail from Alexandria, consisting of 54 warships and 400 transports carrying 14,000 French-trained infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 500 artillerymen, with some 150 cannons.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 235-236.&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian intervention was initially limited to Crete and Cyprus. However, the success of Muhammad Ali's troops in both places settled the Turks on the horns of a very difficult dilemma, since they were afraid of their [[wāli]]'s expansionist ambitions. Muhammad Ali finally agreed to send his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] to Greece in exchange not only for Crete and Cyprus, but for the Peloponnese and [[Syria]] as well.&lt;ref name="Howarth182"&gt;Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 182.&lt;br/&gt;* Sayyid-Marsot, ''Egypt in the Reign of Muhammad Ali'', p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 February 1825, a second loan to Greece was floated in the City of London.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 289.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the Greek government had squandered the money from the first loan, the second loan was oversubscribed and raised some £1.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 289-290.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the first loan, the second loan from the City was to be managed by a Board of Control in London, consisting of the banker Samson Ricardo, two MPs, Edward Ellice and Sir Francis Burdett and John Cam Hobhouse of the London Greek Committee, who were to use the money to buy warships and other supplies, which would then be handed over to the Greeks.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 290"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 290.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Greek government had wasted most of the money from the first loan, the City did not trust them to spend the money from the second loan wisely.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 290"/&gt; The Board of Control used the money to hire the naval hero, Lord Cochrane, to command the Greek Navy and to buy steamships.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 290-291.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the British philhellenes, [[Frank Abney Hastings]] believed that the use of mechanised warships powered by steam and using red-hot shot would allow the Greeks to destroy the Ottoman navy, powered as it was by sail.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Hastings persuaded the Board of Control to invest in the revolutionary technology of the steamship, making the first use of a mechanised warship in a war.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 291-292.&lt;/ref&gt; The two loans from the City imposed a crippling burden on a poor nation like Greece, and only in 1878 was a deal struck between the British creditors and the Greek government to reduce the loans, now worth £10 million, with unpaid interest down to one and a half million pounds sterling, and even then it took the Greeks decades to pay off the loans.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibrahim Pasha landed at [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]] on 24 February 1825, and a month later he was joined by his army of 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry.&lt;ref name="Howarth186"&gt;Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks had not expected Ibrahim Pasha to land during the stormy winter weather, and were taken by surprise.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks initially laughed at the Egyptian soldiers, who were short, skinny ''fallāḥīn'' (peasant) conscripts, many of them blind in one eye owing to the prevalence of parasitic worms that attacked the eye in the Nile, wearing cheap red uniforms comprising a jacket, trousers and a skull-cap.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 238"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 238&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Greeks soon learned that the Egyptians, who were trained by French officers recruited by Mohammed Ali, were tough and hardy soldiers who, unlike the Turkish and Albanian units that the Greeks had been fighting until then, stood their ground in combat.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 238"/&gt; Ibrahim proceeded to [[Battle of Sphacteria (1825)|defeat the Greek garrison]] on the small island of [[Sphacteria]] off the coast of Messenia.&lt;ref name="Howarth188"&gt;Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Greeks in disarray, Ibrahim ravaged the Western Peloponnese and killed [[Papaflessas]] at the [[Battle of Maniaki]].&lt;ref name="Howarth233189"&gt;Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; To try to stop Ibrahim, Kanaris led the [[Greek raid on Alexandria (1825)|raid on Alexandria]], an attempt to destroy the Egyptian fleet that failed due to a sudden change of the wind.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 244.&lt;/ref&gt; The British traveller and Church of England minister, Reverend Charles Swan, reported Ibrahim Pasha as saying to him that he "would burn and destroy the whole Morea".&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 246"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Popular opinion in both Greece and the rest of Europe, soon credited Ibrahim Pasha with the so-called "barbarisation project", where it was alleged that Ibrahim planned to deport the entire Christian Greek population to Egypt as slaves and replace them with Egyptian peasants.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 246"/&gt; It is not clear even today if the "barbarisation project" was a real plan or not, but the possibility that it was created strong demands for humanitarian intervention in Europe.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 246"/&gt; The Porte and Mohammed Ali both denied having plans for the "barbarisation project", but pointedly refused to put their denials into writing.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 254"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Russia warned that if the "barbarisation project" was a real plan, then such an egregious violation of the [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]], under which Russia had a vague claim to be the protector of all the Orthodox peoples of the Ottoman Empire, would lead to Russia going to war against the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 254"/&gt; In turn, the British Foreign Secretary George Canning wrote, rather than run the risk of Russia defeating the Ottomans alone, Britain would have to intervene to stop the "barbarisation project" as the British did not wish to see the Russians conquer the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 246"/&gt; While diplomats and statesmen debated what to do in London and St. Petersburg, the Egyptian advance continued in Greece. The Greek government, in an attempt to stop the Egyptians, released Kolokotronis from captivity, but he too was unsuccessful. By the end of June, Ibrahim had captured the city of [[Argos]] and was within striking distance of [[Nafplion]]. The city was saved by Makriyannis and Dimitrios Ypsilantis who successfully defended Miloi at the outskirts of Nafplion, making the mills outside the town a fortress causing damage to Ibrahim's far superior forces who were unable to take the position and eventually left for Tripolitsa. Makriyannis was wounded and was taken aboard by Europeans who were overseeing the battle. Among them was De Rigny, who had an argument with Makriyannis and advised him to quit his weak position but Makriyannis ignored him.&lt;ref name="el.wikisource.org"/&gt; Commodore Gawen Hamilton of the [[Royal Navy]], placed his ships in a position which looked like he would assist in the defence of the city.&lt;ref name="Howarth233189"/&gt;

[[File:Vryzakis-Stratopedo Karaiskaiki.jpg|thumb|"The camp of [[Georgios Karaiskakis]] at Phaliro" by [[Theodoros Vryzakis]]]]

At the same time, the Turkish armies in Central Greece were besieging the city of [[Missolonghi]] for the [[Third Siege of Missolonghi|third time]]. The siege had begun on 15 April 1825, the day on which Navarino had fallen to Ibrahim.&lt;ref name="Howarth190"&gt;Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', pp.&amp;nbsp;233–34.&lt;/ref&gt; In early autumn, the Greek navy, under the command of [[Andreas Vokos Miaoulis|Miaoulis]] forced the Turkish fleet in the [[Gulf of Corinth]] to retreat, after attacking it with fire ships. The Turks were joined by Ibrahim in mid-winter, but his army had no more luck in penetrating Missolonghi's defences.&lt;ref name="Howarth194"&gt;Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 192–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1826, Ibrahim managed to capture the marshes around the city, although not without heavy losses. He thus cut the Greeks off from the sea and blocked off their supply route.&lt;ref name="Howarth195"&gt;Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the Egyptians and the Turks offering them terms to stop the attacks, the Greeks refused, and continued to fight.&lt;ref name="Howarth196"&gt;Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 April, the Greeks decided to sail from the city during the night, with 3,000 men, to cut a path through the Egyptian lines and allow 6,000 women, children and non-combatants to follow.&lt;ref name="Howarth196"/&gt; However, a [[Bulgaria]]n deserter informed Ibrahim of the Greeks' intention, and he had his entire army deployed; only 1,800 Greeks managed to cut their way through the Egyptian lines. Between 3,000 and 4,000 women and children were enslaved and many of the people who remained behind decided to blow themselves up with gunpowder rather than be enslaved.&lt;ref name="Howarth197"&gt;Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; The news that the [[Third Siege of Missolonghi]] had ended in an Ottoman victory sparked horror all over Greece; at the National Assembly, Kolokotronis was giving a speech when the news of Missolonghi's fall reached him, leaving him to remember: "the news came to us that Missolonghi was lost. We were all plunged into great grief; for half an hour there was so complete a silence that no one would have thought there was a living soul present; each of us was revolving in his mind how great was our misfortune".&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 286"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'' London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 286.&lt;/ref&gt; The American philhellene [[Samuel Gridley Howe]], serving as a doctor with the Greeks, wrote back to America: "I write you with an almost breaking heart. Missolonghi has fallen!", which he called "damning proof of the selfish indifference of the Christian world. You may talk to me of national policy and the necessity of neutrality, but I say, a curse upon such a policy!".&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 286"/&gt; The news of Missolonghi's fall had a huge impact on the rest of Europe, sparking a vast outpouring of songs, poems, essays, sermons and plays in Britain, France, Germany and Switzerland, with the recurring image of Missolonghi's fall being the murder of a sweet and innocent young Greek woman at the hands of the Turks as a symbol of the unwillingness of the Christian powers of the world to do anything for the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'' London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 286-287.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1826, Hastings arrived in Greece with a British-built steamship, the [[Karteria (Greek warship)|''Karteria'']] (Perseverance), which astonished the Greeks to see a ship powered by steam and did not move either via sail or oars.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 292"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'' London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 292.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Karteria'' suffered from constant engine breakdowns, but Hastings was able to use the ship successfully twice over the course of the next two years, at Volos and in the Gulf of Corinth.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 292"/&gt;

Ibrahim sent an envoy to the Maniots demanding that they surrender or else he would ravage their land as he had done to the rest of the Peloponnese. Instead of surrendering, the Maniots simply replied:

{{cquote|&lt;br&gt;From the few Greeks of Mani and the rest of the Greeks who live there to Ibrahim Pasha. We received your letter in which you try to frighten us, saying that if we don't surrender, you'll kill the Maniots and plunder Mani. That's why we are waiting for you and your army. We, the inhabitants of Mani, sign and wait for you.&lt;ref name="Kassis40"&gt;Kassis, ''Mani's History'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Ottoman–Egyptian Invasion of Mani|Ibrahim tried to enter Mani]] from the north-east near Almiro on 21 June 1826, but he was forced to stop at the fortifications at Vergas in northern Mani. His army of 7,000 men was held off by an army of 2,000 Maniots and 500 refugees from other parts of Greece until Kolokotronis attacked the Egyptians from the rear and forced them to retreat. The Maniots pursued the Egyptians all the way to Kalamata before returning to Vergas. Simultaneously, Ibrahim sent his fleet further down the Maniot coast in order to outflank the Greek defenders and attack them from the rear. However, when his force landed at [[Pyrgos Dirou]], they were confronted by a group of Maniot women and repelled. Ibrahim again attempted to enter Mani from central [[Laconia]], but again the Maniots defeated the Turkish and Egyptian forces at Polytsaravo. The Maniot victory dealt the death blow to Ibrahim's hope of occupying Mani.&lt;ref name="Kassis40-1"&gt;Kassis, ''Mani's History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;40–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The losses Ibrahim Pasha had taken at Missolonghi had greatly reduced his army, and he spent the rest of 1826 chasing the Greek guerillas up and down the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'' London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 306-307.&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 1826, Reshid Pasha had arrived outside of Athens and laid siege to the city, marking the beginning of the [[Siege of the Acropolis (1826–27)|siege of the Acropolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 310&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of August, only the Acropolis still held out under [[Yannis Gouras]].&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 310"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 310.&lt;/ref&gt; To break the siege, an attack was launched on Reshid Pasha on 18 August 1826 led by the guerrilla leader [[Georgios Karaiskakis]] and the French philhellene Colonel [[Charles Nicolas Fabvier]] but were driven off with the loss of some 300 dead.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 310"/&gt; On 13 October 1826, Gouras was killed by an Ottoman sniper and a week later, the new commander [[Yannis Makriyannis]] was wounded three times in a single day.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 310"/&gt; In December, Febvier was able to infiltrate a force of some 500 men into the Akropolis, bringing in much needed supplies of gunpowder, through he was much offended when Makriyannis had his men start firing to wake up the Turks, trapping Febvier and his men.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 311"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 311.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1826, the Greek government gave command of its army to the British General Sir [[Richard Church (general)|Richard Church]].&lt;ref name="Brewer, David pages 300"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 300.&lt;/ref&gt; The British historian George Finlay wrote: "Church was of a small, well-made, active frame, and of a healthy constitution. His manner was agreeable and easy, with the polish of a great social experience, and the goodness of his disposition was admitted by his enemies, but the strength of his mind was not the quality of which his friends boasted...Both Church and the Greeks misunderstood one another. The Greeks expected Church to prove a Wellington, with a military chest well supplied from the British treasury. Church expected the irregulars of Greece to execute his strategy like regiments of guards".&lt;ref name="Brewer, David pages 300"/&gt; Church landed in Greece in March 1827, and was welcomed by his old friend Kolokotronis.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David pages 300"/&gt; A week later, Lord Cochrane arrived to take command of the Greek Navy and refused to leave his yacht until the Greeks agreed to form a united government.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David pages 300"/&gt; On 31 March 1827 the Trizina Assembly began its work, drafting a new constitution and offered the presidency of Greece to the former Russian foreign minister, Count [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]].&lt;ref name="Brewer, David pages 300"/&gt; In the meantime, the siege of Athens continued. On 5 February 1827, a force of 2,300 Greeks under the command of Colonel Thomas Gordon landed at Piraeus, and laid siege to the monastery of Ayios Spiridhon, held by Turkish and Albanian troops.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 311"/&gt; In April 1827, Church and Cochrane arrived at Athens and immediately clashed over strategy.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 312"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 312.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Ottoman garrison at Aios Spiridhon surrendered, they were promised safe conduct, but as they were marching out, a shot went off and most of the Ottoman soldiers were killed.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 312"/&gt; Cochrane insisted on a bold but risky plan to stage a night attack across the open plains to break the siege. An operation which launched on 5 May 1827 ended in disaster, as the Greek forces got lost and scattered as the captains quarrelled with one another. This led to a devastating Ottoman cavalry charge in the morning, with Ottomans hunting the scattered Greek forces almost at leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 313.&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 June 1827, the starving and thirsty men in the Acropolis surrendered in the last Ottoman victory of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kapodistrias arrived in Greece to become the Governor on 28 January 1828.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 337.&lt;/ref&gt; The first task of Greece's new leader was to create a state and a civil society, which the workaholic Kapodistrias toiled at mightily, working from 5 am until 10 pm every night.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 339.&lt;/ref&gt; Kapodistrias alienated many with his haughty, high-handed manner and his open contempt for most of the Greek elite, but he attracted support from several of the captains, such as [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] and [[Yannis Makriyannis]] who provided the necessary military force to back up Kapodistrias's decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 339-340.&lt;/ref&gt; As a former Russian foreign minister, Kapodistrias was well connected to the European elite and he attempted to use his connections to secure loans for the new Greek state and to achieve the most favorable borders for Greece, which was being debated by Russian, French and British diplomats.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 344.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign intervention against the Ottomans==
{{See also|Eastern Question}}

===Initial hostility===
When the news of the Greek Revolution was first received, the reaction of the European powers was uniformly hostile. They recognized the degeneration of the [[Ottoman Empire]], but they did not know how to handle this situation (a problem known as the "Eastern Question"). Afraid of the complications the partition of the empire might raise, the British foreign minister [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Viscount Castlereagh]], Austrian foreign minister Prince [[Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]], and the Tsar of Russia [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] shared the same view concerning the necessity of preserving the ''status quo'' and the peace of Europe. They also pleaded that they maintain the [[Concert of Europe]].

Metternich also tried to undermine the Russian foreign minister, [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], who was of Greek origin. Kapodistrias demanded that Alexander declare war on the Ottomans in order to liberate Greece and increase the greatness of Russia. Metternich persuaded Alexander that Kapodistrias was in league with the Italian [[Carbonari]] (an Italian revolutionary group), leading Alexander to disavow him. As a result of the Russian reaction to Alexander Ypsilantis, Kapodistrias resigned as foreign minister and moved to [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;Troyat, ''Alexander of Russia'', pp. 269–270&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Alexander's position was ambivalent, since he regarded himself as the protector of the Orthodox Church, and his subjects were deeply moved by the hanging of the Patriarch. These factors explain why, after denouncing the Greek Revolution, Alexander dispatched an ultimatum to Constantinople on 27 July 1821. However, the danger of war passed temporarily, after Metternich and Castlereagh persuaded the Sultan to make some concessions to the Tsar.&lt;ref&gt;Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', pp. 286–288&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 December 1822, the Holy Alliance denounced the Greek Revolution, considering it audacious.

===Change of stance===
{{double image|right|George Canning by Richard Evans.jpg|175|Nicholasbotman(1).jpg|210|Left: [[George Canning]] was the architect of the [[Treaty of London (1827)|Treaty of London]], which launched European intervention in the Greek conflict.&lt;br /&gt;Right:[[Tsar Nicholas I]] co-signed the Treaty of London, and then launched the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1828–1829, which finally secured Greek independence.}}

In August 1822, [[George Canning]] was appointed by the British government as Foreign Secretary, succeeding Castlereagh. Canning was influenced by the mounting popular agitation against the Ottomans, and believed that a settlement could no longer be postponed. He also feared that Russia might undertake unilateral action against the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1823, Canning declared that "when a whole nation revolts against its conqueror, the nation cannot be considered as piratical but as a nation in a state of war". In February 1823 he notified the Ottoman Empire that Britain would maintain friendly relations with the Turks only under the condition that the latter respected the Christian subjects of the Empire. The Commissioner of the [[Ionian Islands]], which belonged to Britain, was ordered to consider the Greeks in a state of war and give them the right to cut off certain areas from which the Turks could get provisions.&lt;ref name="Br52" /&gt;

These measures led to the increase of British influence. This influence was reinforced by the issuing of two loans that the Greeks managed to conclude with British fund-holders in 1824 and 1825. These loans, which, in effect, made the City of London the financier of the revolution,&lt;ref name="Br52" /&gt; inspired the creation of the "British" political party in Greece, whose opinion was that the revolution could only end in success with the help of Britain. At the same time, parties affiliated to Russia and France made their appearance. These parties would later strive for power during king Otto's reign.&lt;ref&gt;"Newer and Modern History"(Ιστορία Νεότερη και Σύγχρονη), Vas. Sfyroeras, Schoolbook for Triti Gymnasiou, 6th edition, Athens 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;191–192&lt;/ref&gt;

When Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] succeeded Alexander in December 1825, Canning decided to act immediately: he sent the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] to Russia, and the outcome was the [[Protocol of St Petersburg]] of 4 April 1826.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 256"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence The Struggle for Freedom from Ottoman Oppression'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 256&lt;/ref&gt; According to the protocol, the two powers agreed to mediate between the Ottomans and the Greeks on the basis of complete autonomy of Greece under Turkish sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David page 256"/&gt; The Anglo-Russian protocol that Wellington negotiated with Nicholas in St. Petersburg attracted much scorn from Metternich, who was consistently the most pro-Ottoman and anti-Greek European statesmen. Metternich  dismissively wrote, "If the Irish were to revolt against the British Crown, and the King of France were to offer to mediate," leading him to ask: "Is England then ready to regard as a Power equal to rights to that of the [British] King the first Irish Club which declares itself the Insurgent Government of Ireland? To regard as justified the French Power which would accept the office of mediator, by reason of the sole fact that the invitation had been addressed to it by the Irish Government?...Whither does this absurdity not lead us?".&lt;ref name="Brewer, David pages 257"&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia, whose king Frederich Wilhelm was close to Metternich, chose to follow the Austrian lead.&lt;ref name="Brewer, David pages 257"/&gt; Before he met with Wellington, the Tsar had already sent an ultimatum to the Porte, demanding that the principalities be evacuated immediately, and that plenipotentiaries be sent to Russia to settle outstanding issues. The Sultan agreed to send the plenipotentiaries, and on 7 October 1826 signed the [[Akkerman Convention]], in which Russian demands concerning Serbia and the principalities were accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks formally applied for the mediation provided in the Petersburg Protocol, while the Turks and the Egyptians showed no willingness to stop fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence The Struggle for Freedom from Ottoman Oppression'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 316&lt;/ref&gt; France, which initially backed its client Muhammad Ali the Great with weapons and officers to train his army, changed its stance, partly because of the pro-Greek feelings of the French people, and partly because King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] saw the offer to impose mediation as a way of assuring French influence in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence The Struggle for Freedom from Ottoman Oppression'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 316-317&lt;/ref&gt; Since Britain and Russia were going to impose mediation with or without France, if the French declined the offer to impose mediation, Greece would be in the Anglo-Russian sphere of influence, while if the French did take part, then Greece would also be in the French sphere of influence.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence The Struggle for Freedom from Ottoman Oppression'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 317&lt;/ref&gt; Canning therefore prepared for action by negotiating the [[Treaty of London (1827)|Treaty of London]] (6 July 1827) with France and Russia. This provided that the Allies should again offer negotiations, and if the Sultan rejected it, they would exert all the means which circumstances would allow to force the cessation of hostilities. Meanwhile, news reached Greece in late July 1827 that Mehmet Ali's new fleet was completed in [[Alexandria]] and sailing towards [[Pylos|Navarino]] to join the rest of the Egyptian-Turkish fleet. The aim of this fleet was to attack Hydra and knock the island's fleet out of the war. On 29 August, the Porte formally rejected the Treaty of London's stipulations, and, subsequently, the commanders-in-chief of the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|British]] and [[Mediterranean Fleet (France)|French]] Mediterranean fleets, Admiral [[Edward Codrington]] and Admiral [[Henri de Rigny]], sailed into the Gulf of Argos and requested to meet with Greek representatives on board {{HMS|Asia|1824|6}}.&lt;ref name="Howarth231"&gt;Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Battle of Navarino (1827)====
{{Main|Battle of Navarino}}
[[File:ModernEgypt, Muhammad Ali by Auguste Couder, BAP 17996.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] (by [[Auguste Couder]], 1841, [[Palace of Versailles]]), whose expedition to the Peloponnese precipitated European intervention in the Greek conflict.]]

After the Greek delegation, led by Mavrocordatos, accepted the terms of the treaty, the Allies prepared to insist upon the armistice, and their fleets were instructed to intercept supplies destined for Ibrahim's forces. When Mehmet Ali's fleet, which had been warned by the British and French to stay away from Greece, left Alexandria and joined other Ottoman/Egyptian units at Navarino on 8 September, Codrington arrived with his squadron off Navarino on 12 September. On 13 October, Codrington was joined, off Navarino, by his allied support, a French squadron under De Rigny and a Russian squadron under [[Login Petrovich Geiden|Login Geiden]].&lt;ref name="Howarth233-34"&gt;Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', pp. 231–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon their arrival at Navarino, Codgrinton and de Rigny tried to negotiate with Ibrahim, but Ibrahim insisted that by the Sultan's order he must destroy Hydra. Codrington responded by saying that if Ibrahim's fleets attempted to go anywhere but home, he would have to destroy them. Ibrahim agreed to write to the Sultan to see if he would change his orders, but he also complained about the Greeks being able to continue their attacks. Codrington promised that he would stop the Greeks and Philhellenes from attacking the Turks and Egyptians. After doing this, he disbanded most of his fleet, which returned to Malta, while the French went to the Aegean.&lt;ref name="Howarth233-34"/&gt;

However, when [[Frank Abney Hastings|Frank Hastings]], a [[Philhellenism|Philhellene]], destroyed a Turkish naval squadron during a [[Battle of Itea|raid off Itea]], Ibrahim sent a detachment of his fleet out of Navarino in order to defeat Hastings. Codrington had not heard of Hastings's actions and thought that Ibrahim was breaking his agreement. Codrington intercepted the force and made them retreat and did so again on the following day when Ibrahim led the fleet in person. Codrington assembled his fleet once more, with the British returning from Malta and the French from the Aegean. They were also joined by the Russian contingent led by Count Login Geiden. Ibrahim now began a campaign to annihilate the Greeks of the Peloponnese as he thought the Allies had reneged on their agreement.&lt;ref name="Howarth236-37"&gt;Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', pp. 236–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Naval Battle of Navarino by Garneray.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|''The Naval [[Battle of Navarino]]'' by [[Ambroise Louis Garneray]] (1827).]]

On 20 October 1827, as the weather got worse, the British, Russian and French fleets entered the Bay of Navarino in peaceful formation to shelter themselves and to make sure that the Egyptian-Turkish fleet did not slip off and attack Hydra. When a British [[frigate]] sent a boat to request the Egyptians to move their fire ships, the officer on board was shot by the Egyptians. The frigate responded with musket fire in retaliation and an Egyptian ship fired a cannon shot at the French flagship, the Sirene, which returned fire.&lt;ref name="Howarth239"&gt;Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; A full engagement was begun which ended in a complete victory for the Allies and in the annihilation of the Egyptian-Turkish fleet. Of the 89 Egyptian-Turkish ships that took part in the battle, only 14 made it back to Alexandria and their dead amounted to over 8,000. The Allies didn't lose a ship and suffered only 181 deaths. The Porte demanded compensation from the Allies for the ships, but his demand was refused on the grounds that the Turks had acted as the aggressors. The three countries' ambassadors also left Constantinople.&lt;ref name="Howarth241"&gt;Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the battle was criticized as being an 'untoward event' towards Turkey, which was called an 'ancient ally'. Codrington was recalled and blamed for having allowed the retreating Egyptian-Turkish ships to carry 2,000 Greek slaves. In France, the news of the battle was greeted with great enthusiasm and the government had an unexpected surge in popularity. Russia formally took the opportunity to declare war on the Turks.&lt;ref name="Howarth241"/&gt;

In October 1828, the Greeks regrouped and formed a new government under Kapodistrias. They then advanced to seize as much territory as possible, including [[Athens]] and [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], before the Western powers imposed a ceasefire. As far as the Peloponnese was concerned, Britain and Russia accepted the offer of France to send an army to expel Ibrahim's forces. [[Nicolas Joseph Maison]], who was given command of the French expeditionary Corps, landed on 30 August 1828 at [[Petalidi]] and helped the Greeks evacuate the Peloponnese from all the hostile troops by 30 October. Maison thus implemented the convention Codrington had negotiated and signed in Alexandria with Muhammad Ali, which provided for the withdrawal of all Egyptian troops from the Peloponnese.&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, ''History of the Greek Revolution'', II, 192–193&lt;br /&gt;* Williams, ''The Ottoman Empire and Its Successors'', 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The final major engagement of the war was the [[Battle of Petra]], which occurred north of [[Attica]]. Greek forces under Demetrius Ypsilantis, for the first time trained to fight as a regular European army rather than as guerrilla bands, advanced against Aslan Bey's forces and defeated them. The Turks surrendered all lands from [[Livadeia]] to the [[Spercheios River]] in exchange for safe passage out of [[Central Greece]]. As [[George Finlay]] stresses: "Thus Prince [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] had the honor of terminating the war which his brother had commenced on the banks of the Pruth."&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, ''History of the Greek Revolution'', II, 208&lt;/ref&gt;

===From autonomy to independence===
[[File:Map Greece expansion 1832-1947-en.svg|thumb|350px|Map showing the original territory of the [[Kingdom of Greece]] as laid down in the Treaty of 1832 (in dark blue)]]

In September 1828, the [[Conference of Poros]] opened to discuss what should be the borders of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 344&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 December 1828, the ambassadors of Britain, Russia, and France met on the island of [[Poros]] and prepared a protocol, which provided for the creation of an autonomous state ruled by a monarch, whose authority should be confirmed by a [[Firman (decree)|firman]] of the Sultan. The proposed borderline ran from [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] to [[Volos]], and, despite Kapodistrias' efforts, the new state would include only the islands of the [[Cyclades]], the [[Sporades]], [[Samos]], and maybe [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 344-345&lt;/ref&gt; The Sublime Porte, which had rejected the call for an armistice in 1827, now rejected the conclusions of the Poros conference, with the Sultan [[Mahmud II]] saying he would never grant Greece independence, and the war would go on until he reconquered all of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 345&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the Protocol of Poros, the London Conference agreed on the [[London Protocol (1829)|protocol of 22 March 1829]], which accepted most of the ambassadors' proposals but drew the borders farther south than the initial proposal and did not include Samos and Crete in the new state.&lt;ref&gt;Dimakis, ''The Great Powers and the Struggle of 1821'', 525&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|pressure from Russia]], the Porte finally agreed on the terms of the Treaty of London of 6 July 1827 and of the Protocol of 22 March 1829. Soon afterward, Britain and France conceived the idea of an independent Greek state, trying to limit the influence of Russia on the new state.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge &amp; Bullen, ''The Great Powers and the European States System'', 83&lt;br /&gt;* Dimakis, ''The Great Powers and the Struggle of 1821'', 526–527&lt;/ref&gt; Russia disliked the idea but could not reject it, and consequently the three powers finally agreed to create an independent Greek state under their joint protection, concluding the [[London Protocol (1830)|protocols of 3 February 1830]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gr/NR/rdonlyres/E1DA0D5F-5493-4BF4-8FD3-D5CD6C6BB96C/0/1830_london_protocol.doc |title=London Protocol |accessdate=26 December 2008 |format=DOC |publisher=Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185207/http://www.mfa.gr/NR/rdonlyres/E1DA0D5F-5493-4BF4-8FD3-D5CD6C6BB96C/0/1830_london_protocol.doc |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Right: After Kapodistrias' assassination, the London Conference (1832) established the [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|Kingdom of Greece]] with [[Otto of Greece|Otto of Bavaria]] as the first King.}}

By one of the protocols, the Greek throne was initially offered to [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold]], Prince of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] and the future [[Monarchy of Belgium|King of Belgium]]. Discouraged by the gloomy picture painted by Kapodistrias, and unsatisfied with the Aspropotamos-Zitouni borderline, which replaced the more favorable line running from Arta to Volos considered by the Great Powers earlier, he refused. Negotiations temporarily stalled after Kapodistrias was assassinated in 1831 in [[Nafplion]] by the [[Mavromichalis family|Mavromichalis clan]], after having demanded that they unconditionally submit to his authority. When they refused, Kapodistrias put [[Petrobey Mavromichalis|Petrobey]] in jail, sparking vows of vengeance from his clan.&lt;ref&gt;Clogg, ''A Short History of Modern Greece'', pp. 66–67&lt;br /&gt;* Verzijl, ''International Law in Historical Perspective'', pp. 462–463&lt;/ref&gt;

The withdrawal of Leopold as a candidate for the throne of Greece and the [[July Revolution]] in France further delayed the final settlement of the new kingdom's frontiers until a new government was formed in Britain. [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], who took over as British Foreign Secretary, agreed to the Arta–Volos borderline. However, the secret note on Crete, which the Bavarian plenipotentiary communicated to Britain, France and Russia, bore no fruit.

In May&amp;nbsp;1832, Palmerston convened the [[London Conference of 1832|London Conference]]. The three Great Powers, Britain, [[July Monarchy|France]] and Russia, offered the throne to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavarian]] prince, [[Otto of Greece|Otto of Wittelsbach]]; meanwhile, the [[Fifth National Assembly at Nafplion]] had approved the choice of Otto, and passed the Constitution of 1832 (which would come to be known as the "Hegemonic Constitution"). As co-guarantors of the monarchy, the Great Powers also agreed to guarantee a loan of 60&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;francs to the new king, empowering their ambassadors in the Ottoman capital to secure the end of the war. Under the protocol signed on May&amp;nbsp;7, 1832 between Bavaria and the protecting powers, Greece was defined as a "monarchical and independent state" but was to pay an indemnity to the Porte. The protocol outlined the way in which the Regency was to be managed until Otto reached his majority, while also concluding the second Greek loan for a sum of £2.4&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Clogg, ''A Short History of Modern Greece'', pp. 68–69&lt;br /&gt;* {{Cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gr/NR/rdonlyres/2201071A-B2D4-4360-A8A3-6C4C324DA136/0/1832_constantinople_treaty.doc |title=Treaty of Constantinople |accessdate=26 December 2008 |format=DOC |publisher=Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002170858/http://www.mfa.gr/NR/rdonlyres/2201071A-B2D4-4360-A8A3-6C4C324DA136/0/1832_constantinople_treaty.doc |archivedate=2 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;br /&gt;* See the full text of the Protocol in Dodsley, ''Annual Register'', p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Massacres==
{{Main|Massacres during the Greek Revolution}}
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - Le Massacre de Scio.jpg|thumb|Eugène Delacroix|[[Eugène Delacroix]]'s ''[[The Massacre at Chios|Massacre of Chios]]'' (1824, oil on canvas, [[Louvre]], Paris)]]

Almost as soon as the revolution began, there were large scale massacres of civilians by both Greek revolutionaries and Ottoman authorities.{{cref|vii}} Greek revolutionaries massacred Jews, Muslims, and Christians suspected of Ottoman sympathies alike, mainly in the Peloponnese and Attica where Greek forces were dominant.&lt;ref&gt;William St Clair, That Greece Might Still Be Free, Open Book Publishers, 2008, p.104-107 [http://www.google.gr/books?id=NphFnF2RRKUC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=greeks+killed+turks&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AXu4By6pzL&amp;sig=MVIc17kVYg7E7WPQCabJxKiuEw4&amp;hl=gr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hjUkUPaEMsTLswam24HgDA&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ebook]&lt;/ref&gt; The Turks massacred Greeks identified with the revolution, especially in Anatolia, Crete, Constantinople, [[Cyprus]], Macedonia and the Aegean islands.&lt;ref&gt;Peacock, Herbert Leonard, ''A History of Modern Europe'', (Heinemann Educational Publishers; 7th edition, September 1982) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; They also massacred unarmed Greeks in places which did not revolt, as in [[Smyrna]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://digitalcommons.unf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&amp;context=ahis_facpub Theophilus C. Prousis, "Smyrna in 1821: A Russian View", 1992, History Faculty Publications. 16, University of North Florida]&lt;/ref&gt; and Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;See article [[Constantinople massacre of 1821]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the more infamous atrocities include the [[Chios Massacre]], the [[Constantinople massacre of 1821|Constantinople Massacre]], the [[Destruction of Psara]], the massacres following the [[Tripolitsa Massacre]], and the [[Navarino Massacre]]. There is debate among scholars over whether the massacres committed by the Greeks should be regarded as a response to prior events (such as the massacre of the Greeks of Tripoli, after the failed [[Orlov Revolt]] of 1770 and the destruction of the [[Sacred Band (1821)|Sacred Band]]&lt;ref&gt;Booras, ''Hellenic Independence and America's Contribution to the Cause''. p. 24.&lt;br /&gt;* Brewer, ''The Greek War of Independence'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;) or as separate atrocities, which started simultaneously with the outbreak of the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, ''History of the Greek Revolution'', I, 171–172&lt;br /&gt;* Jelavich, ''History of the Balkans'', p. 217&lt;br /&gt;* St. Clair, ''That Greece Might still Be Free'', pp. 1–3, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, tens of thousands of Greek civilians were killed, left to die or taken into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;St. Clair, ''That Greece Might still Be Free'', pp. 80–81, 92&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Greeks in the Greek quarter of Constantinople were massacred.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fisher, H.A.L]], ''A History of Europe'', (Edward Arnold, London, 1936 &amp; 1965) p. 882&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of Christian clergymen were also killed, including the Ecumenical Patriarch Gregory V.{{cref|viii}}

Sometimes marked as allies of the Turks in the Peloponnese, Jewish settlements were also massacred by Greek revolutionaries; Steve Bowman argues that the tragedy may have been more a side-effect of the butchering of the Turks of Tripolis, the last Ottoman stronghold in the South, where the Jews had taken refuge from the fighting, than a specific action against Jews as such. Many Jews around Greece and throughout Europe were supporters of the Greek revolt, using their resources to loan substantial amounts to the newly formed Greek government. In turn, the success of the Greek Revolution was to stimulate the incipient stirrings of Jewish nationalism, later called [[Zionism]].&lt;ref name="Rivlin"&gt;Bowman, "The Jews of Greece", [http://www.umass.edu/judaic/anniversaryvolume/articles/30-F3-Bowman.pdf 421–422] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Theodoros Vryzakis, Grateful Hellas (1858).jpg|thumb|left|upright|"Grateful Hellas" by [[Theodoros Vryzakis]]]]

The consequences of the Greek revolution were somewhat ambiguous in the immediate aftermath. An independent Greek state had been established, but with Britain, Russia and France claiming a major role in Greek politics, an imported Bavarian dynast as ruler, and a mercenary army.&lt;ref name="Jelavich229-34"&gt;Jelavich, ''History of the Balkans'', pp.&amp;nbsp;229–34.&lt;/ref&gt; The country had been ravaged by ten years of fighting and was full of displaced refugees and empty Turkish estates, necessitating a series of land reforms over several decades.&lt;ref name="Sowards"/&gt;

The population of the new state numbered 800,000, representing less than one-third of the 2.5 million Greek inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire. During a great part of the next century, the Greek state sought the liberation of the "[[irredentism|unredeemed]]" Greeks of the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the [[Megali Idea]], i.e., the goal of uniting all Greeks in one country.&lt;ref name="Sowards"/&gt;

As a people, the Greeks no longer provided the princes for the Danubian Principalities, and were regarded within the Ottoman Empire, especially by the Muslim population, as traitors. [[Phanariotes]], who had until then held high office within the Ottoman Empire, were thenceforth regarded as suspect, and lost their special, privileged status. In Constantinople and the rest of the Ottoman Empire where Greek banking and merchant presence had been dominant, Armenians mostly replaced Greeks in banking, and Jewish merchants gained importance.&lt;ref name="Jelavich229"&gt;Jelavich, ''History of the Balkans'', p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

In the long-term historical perspective, this marked a seminal event in the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, despite the small size and the impoverishment of the new Greek state. For the first time, a Christian subject people had achieved independence from Ottoman rule and established a fully independent state, recognized by Europe. Whereas previously, only large nations (such as the British or the French) were judged worthy of national self-determination by the Great Powers of Europe, the Greek Revolt legitimized the concept of small, ethnically based nation-states, and emboldened nationalist movements among other subject peoples of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Serbs]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Albanians]] (who did not fight against the Ottomans but against their Balkan neighbours), [[Romanians]] and [[Armenians]] all subsequently fought for and won their independence.

Shortly after the war ended, the people of the Russian-dependent [[Congress Poland|Poland]], encouraged by the Greek victory, started the [[November Uprising]], hoping to regain their independence. The uprising, however, failed, and Polish independence had to wait until 1918. The newly established Greek state would become a catalyst for further expansion and, over the course of a century, [[Macedonia (Greece)|parts of Macedonia]], [[Crete]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], many [[Aegean Islands]] and other Greek-speaking territories would unite with the new Greek state.

{{Cnote|v|Clogg asserts that uncertainty surrounds the total number of those recruited into the Filiki Eteria.

{{Cnote|vi|As Koliopoulos &amp; Veremis argue, Ypsilantis proposed a smaller electorate, limited to the more "prestigious" men of the districts. On the other hand, the notables insisted on the principle of [[universal suffrage]], because they were confident that they could secure the support of their people. They thus advocated "democratic" principles, while Ypsilantis and the military promoted "aristocratic" procedures. Koliopoulos &amp; Veremis conclude that "Ypsilantis' assembly was essentially a royal chamber, while that of the local notables was closer to a parliament".&lt;ref&gt;Koliopoulos &amp; Veremis, ''Greece: the Modern Sequel'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Hasania''' (or '''Hassania''') are members of a Muslim tribe of [[Arab]] origin. As of 1911, they were inhabitants of the desert between [[Merowe, Sudan|Merowe]] and the [[Nile]] at the [[Cataracts of the Nile|6th Cataract]], and the left bank of the [[Blue Nile]] immediately south of [[Khartoum]].

==Origin and present circumstances==

The Hiranbaz are sub-group within the [[Qassab]] community. Their name literally means a deer hunter, and they were employed as professional deer hunters by the rulers of [[Bikaner]]. They trace their origin to the town of Merta in [[Nagaur District]], and are now found in [[Bikaner District]]. The Hiranbaz speak [[Marwari language|Marwari]], and many now also speak [[Urdu]]. They are divided into a number of clans, the main ones being the Solanki and Panwar.

'''ICPSR''', the '''Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research''', was established in 1962. An integral part of the infrastructure of [[social science]] research, ICPSR maintains and provides access to a vast archive of social science data for research and instruction (over 8,000 discrete studies/surveys with more than 65,000 datasets). Since 1963, ICPSR has offered training in [[quantitative research|quantitative methods]] to facilitate effective data use. The [http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/sumprog ICPSR Summer Program in Quantitative Methods of Social Research] offers a comprehensive curriculum in research design, statistics, data analysis, and methodology. To ensure that data resources are available to future generations of scholars, ICPSR curates and preserves data, migrating them to new storage media and file formats as changes in technology warrant. In addition, ICPSR provides user support to assist researchers in identifying relevant data for analysis and in conducting their research projects.

ICPSR supports students, instructors, researchers, and policy makers who:
* Conduct secondary research to support primary research findings or generate new findings
* Preserve and disseminate primary research data
* Study or teach statistical methods in quantitative analysis
* Write articles, papers, or theses to fulfill undergraduate or graduate requirements
* Develop funding proposals for grants or contracts that require a data management plan

ICPSR provides a number of tools as classroom aids for college-level instructors:
* Bibliography of Data-related Literature — citations to data from published works; a good starting point for literature reviews and research papers
* Social Science Variables Database — lets students learn by comparing variables across datasets
* Survey Documentation and Analysis online analysis package — allows exploration of data directly online
* Crosstab Assignment Builder — lets students create contingency tables from ICSPR data using an instructor-predefined subset of variables

A unit within the [[University of Michigan Institute for Social Research|Institute for Social Research]] at the [[University of Michigan]], ICPSR is a membership-based organization, with approximately 760 member colleges and universities and other research institutions around the world. A Governing Council of leading scholars and data professionals guides and oversees the activities of ICPSR.

While many of the datasets housed at ICPSR are provided to the public without cost, most require the user to be a member of an ICPSR member institution or to pay a download fee.

The ICPSR data archive is listed in the [[Registry of Research Data Repositories]] re3data.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICPSR entry in re3data.org|url=http://service.re3data.org/repository/r3d100010255|website=www.re3data.org|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ICPSR Summer Program in Quantitative Methods of Social Research ==
The founders of ICPSR believed researchers needed training to use the data the consortium was providing.

The first Summer Program was held in 1963 and was attended by 21 faculty members and 41 graduate students from member institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/files/ICPSR/fifty/sumprog63-64.pdf|title = 1963-1964 ICPSR Annual Report|date = |accessdate = December 10, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program offered nine courses, with the most popular class, "Proseminar in Behavior Research Methods," attracting 46 participants.

The Summer Program expanded its offerings and participation over time. In 2015, the ICPSR Summer Program offered 81 courses addressing quantitative and analytic skills taught by 101 instructors from across North America and Europe. Participants included students, faculty, and nonacademic researchers from more than 40 countries, 300 institutions, and 30 disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/sumprog/|title = ICPSR Summer Program|date = |accessdate = December 10, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iraqis in Germany''' include migrants from [[Iraq]] to [[Germany]], as well as their descendants. The number of Iraqis in Germany is estimated at around +300,000 people. Of which 122,000 refugees accepted in 2015.&lt;ref name=PopulationPressures&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecre.org/positions/Iraq_Quest_Summary_Apr04.shtml |title=Population pressures |accessdate=2007-08-19 |publisher=ecre.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807230323/http://www.ecre.org/positions/Iraq_Quest_Summary_Apr04.shtml |archivedate=2007-08-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iraqi community is made up of ethnic [[Arabs]], [[Kurds in Iraq|Kurds]], [[Iraqi Turkmen]], as well as smaller minority groups. 

==History and population==
The number of Iraqis in Germany is estimated at around 300,000.&lt;ref name=PopulationPressures /&gt; In 2015, out of 2,727 asylum applications for Iraqi refugees, only 8.3 percent were accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,507444,00.html The Iraqi Exodus:Number of Iraqi refugees in Germany Surges]&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources claim there to be just around 40,000 Iraqi refugees residing in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.peopleandplanet.net/doc.php?id=1933# |title=Iraqi refugees in European nations |access-date=2015-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212544/http://www.peopleandplanet.net/doc.php?id=1933# |archive-date=2007-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Germany granted just 8.3 percent of Iraqi asylum demands, according to the ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haveeru1.com.mv/english/?page=details&amp;id=18230 Refugees find Germany "1000 times better than Iraq"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Germany received 2,117 applications for asylum from Iraqis, which is the third highest number in the EU. The country is already home to a sizeable Iraqi population, many of whom were granted protection by the German authorities after fleeing persecution from Saddam Hussein’s former regime. However, the recognition rate for Iraqis has fallen from an average of 57 per cent between 1997 and 2001, to a mere 11 per cent for the year 2006, which is one of the lowest in the European Union.&lt;ref name=IraqisInEurope /&gt;

However, Germany has adopted another policy towards Iraqi refugees which has distinguished it from all other EU states, the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|German Federal Ministry of the Interior]] has taken the unique step of systematically revoking the refugee status of thousands of Iraqis who were granted protection before 2003. Since the threat of persecution from the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Iraqi Ba’ath regime]] is no longer present, 18,000 Iraqi refugees who entered the country before the 2003 invasion have thus had their refugee status revoked, placing them in a situation of uncertainty and precariousness. In June 2007, the German government asked the asylum authorities to temporarily suspend the revocation of refugee status for certain groups of Iraqis such as those from Baghdad, single women, and members of religious or ethnic minorities such as [[Assyrians in Iraq|Iraqi Assyrians]].&lt;ref name=IraqisInEurope&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/publ/RESEARCH/470c9be92.pdf |title=Iraqis in Europe |accessdate=2008-02-14 |publisher=unhcr.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906113441/http://www.unhcr.org/publ/RESEARCH/470c9be92.pdf |archivedate=September 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was estimated in April 2007 that 14,000 Iraqis were living with 'tolerated status' in Germany, with the threat of possible imminent deportation hanging over them.

'''Kambera''', also known as '''East Sumbanese''', is a [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language]] spoken in the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Indonesia]]. Kambera is a member of Bima-Sumba subgrouping within Central Malayo-Polynesian inside Malayo-Polynesian.&lt;ref&gt;Klamer, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The island of Sumba, located in the Eastern Indonesia, has an area of 12,297&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Klamer 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The name Kambera comes from a traditional region which is close to a town in Waingapu. Because of export trades which concentrated in [[Waingapu]] in the 19th century, the language of the Kambera region has become the bridging language in eastern Sumba.

==Morphology==

===Pronouns and Person Markers===
Personal pronouns are used in Kambera for emphasis/disambiguation and the syntactic relation between full pronouns and [[clitic]]s is similar to that between NPs and clitics. NPs and pronouns have morphological [[Grammatical case|case]].

{| class="wikitable" 
|+ Personal Pronouns
|-

Kambera, as a [[head-marking language]], has rich morpho-syntactic marking on its predicators. The pronominal, aspectual and/or mood clitics together with the predicate constitute the nuclear [[clause]]. Definite verbal arguments are crossreferenced on the predicate for person, number and case ([[Nominative case|Nominative]] (N), [[Genitive case|Gentive]] (G), [[Dative case|Dative]] (D), [[Accusative case|Accusative]] (A)). The four main pronominal clitic paradigms are given below.

=== Possession ===
Kambera has a possessive or reflexive noun ''wiki'' ‘self/own’, which can be
used to mark possession (1). 
:{|
|(1)
|''Uma''
|''wiki''
|''-nggu''
|-
|
|house
|self/own
|&lt;nowiki&gt;-1sG&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|
| colspan="3" |'My own house'
|}
''Wiki'' has the structural properties of a noun and can be used as a nominal modifier (compare 2 &amp; 3), unlike pronouns which must be cross-referenced on the noun with a genitive clitic (3).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Grammar of Kambera|last = Klamer|first = Marian|publisher = Mouton de Gruyter|year = 1998|isbn = 3-11-016187-7|location = Berlin; New York|pages = 130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{|
|(2)
|''Uma''
|''witu''
|''-nggu''
|-
|
|house
|grass
|&lt;nowiki&gt;-1sG&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|
| colspan="3" |'My hut'
|}
:{|
|(3)
|''Uma''
|''-nggu''
|''nyungga''
|-
|
|house
|&lt;nowiki&gt;-1sG&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|I
|-
|
| colspan="3" |'My house'
|}
As (3) is a possessed noun phrase, the enclitic attaches to the noun. In possessed and modified noun phrases, the genitive enclitic attaches to the noun modifier (4).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Grammar of Kambera|last = Klamer|first = Marian|publisher = Mouton de Gruyter|year = 1998|isbn = 3-11-016187-7|location = Berlin; New York|pages = 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{|
|(4)
|''Na''
|''uma''
|''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'bakul''
|''-nggu''
|-
|
|ART
|house
|be big
|&lt;nowiki&gt;-1sG&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|
| colspan="4" |'My big house'
|}
In Kambera, where cross-referencing is used, the noun phrase is optional. A verb along with its pronominal markers constitutes a complete sentence. Pronominal clitics are a morphological way of expressing relationships between syntactic constituents such as a noun and its possessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Grammar of Kambera|last = Klamer|first = Marian|publisher = Mouton de Gruyter|year = 1998|isbn = 3-11-016187-7|location = Berlin; New York|pages = 60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Possessor Relativisation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Grammar of Kambera|last = Klamer|first = Marian|publisher = Mouton de Gruyter|year = 1998|isbn = 3-11-016187-7|location = Berlin; New York|pages = 320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Possessors can be relativised with a ''ma-'' relative clause. There are three types of clauses used in the relativisation of possessors.

The first is when the embedded verb is derived from a relational noun such as mother or child. These derived transitive verbs express relations between the subject and the object (5).
:{|
|(5)
|''Na''
|''anakeda''
|''[na''
|''ma-''
|''ina''
|''-nya]''
|-
|
|ART
|child
|[ART
|RmS-
|mother
|&lt;nowiki&gt;-3sD]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|
| colspan="6" |'the child whose mother she is'/'the child she is the mother of'
|}
The second clause type is where the possessor is the head of the ma- relative clause and the possessee is the subject of the embedded verb (6).
:{|
|(6)
|''Ita''
|''-nggu''
|''-nya''
|''[na''
|''tau''
|''na''
|''ma-meti''
|''kuru uma''
|''-na]''
|-
|
|See
|&lt;nowiki&gt;-1sG&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|&lt;nowiki&gt;-3sD&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|[ART
|person
|ART
|RmS-die
|wife
|&lt;nowiki&gt;-3sG]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|
| colspan="9" |'I saw [the man whose wife died]
|}
The final type is where the relative clause contains the verb ''ningu'' ‘be’ and the incorporated argument of this verb. The head of the relative construction is the possessor (7).
:{|
|(7)
|''Na''
|''tau''
|''na''
|''ma-''
|''ningu''
|''ihi''
|''woka''
|''.ng''
|-
|
|ART
|person
|ART
|RmS-
|be
|content
|garden
|.ng
|-
|
| colspan="8" |'the person that has crops' (lit.: 'the person whose garden content is')
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;N.B: the morpheme ''.ng'' marks the edge of incorporation

Normally, the possessor pronoun ''nyuna'' ‘he/she’ follows the possessed noun (8), though it can also be the head of a relativised clause (9).
:{|
|(8)
|''Na''
|''marihak''
|''[na''
|''kalembi''
|''-na''
|''nyuna]''
|-
|
|ART
|be dirty
|[ART
|shirt
|&lt;nowiki&gt;-3sG&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|he]
|-
|
| colspan="6" |'His shirt is dirty'
|}
:{|
|(9)
|''Nyuna''
|''na''
|''[ma-''
|''marihak''
|''na''
|''kalembi''
|''-na''
|-
|
|He
|ART
|RmS-
|be dirty
|ART
|shirt
|&lt;nowiki&gt;-3sG&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|
| colspan="7" |'He whose shirt is dirty'
|}

Possessors can also be relativised in the same way as subjects. For example, in the following headless relative clause (no possessor NP is present), a definite article is present (10).
:{|
|(10)
|Na
|ma-
|rabih
|karaha
|kalai
|&lt;nowiki&gt;-na&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|
|ART
|RmS-
|trickle
|side
|left
|&lt;nowiki&gt;-3sG&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|
| colspan="6" |'The (one) whose left side trickles (i.e. lets water through)' 
(mythological character that is the source of rain)
|}

[[File:Expos.rural_floridayparag_1875.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The first Rural Exhibition held in Buenos Aires, 1875.]]

'''''La Exposición Rural''''' (in English: The Rural Exhibition), is an annual [[agricultural show|agricultural and livestock show]] held in the [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]] section of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].  The event is organised by ''La Sociedad Rural Argentina'' (in English: The Argentine Rural Society) and both the Exhibition and the Society are known locally as ''La Rural''.

The exhibition has taken place in the society's [[Santa Fe Avenue]] exhibition centre and fairground, each year in July since 1886. Primarily a farming show, breeders arrive from all over the country to exhibit their [[livestock]], particularly [[cattle]]. It became a major feature of the ''[[porteño]]'' social scene in prosperous Argentina, taking place in [[Buenos Aires]]' most exclusive neighbourhood and accompanied by [[Ball (dance)|ball]]s and other events. However, with the onset of the country's economic crisis towards the end of the 20th century, the event lost some of its vitality, although it is still popular with visitors. In 2005, 715,000 people visited the exhibition, which had almost 400 stands and 4,000 animals.

The Society was founded on 10 July 1866 by Eduardo Olivera and José Martínez de Hoz with the motto 'To cultivate the soil is to serve the country', and was formerly known as 'El Solar de Palermo'. Built in the 1870s, the Society's showground features a [[Belle Époque|Belle Epoque]] stadium and a modern exhibition hall. During the rest of the year, the exhibition hall is used for other events including [[trade show]]s.

===Slang names for cannabis===
The slang word ''[[Marijuana (word)|marihuana]]'' was first used in the United States in the early part of the twentieth century, and was popularized to demonize and eventually ban cannabis in the 1930s. Most slang names for cannabis date to the [[Jazz Age|jazz era]]. ''Weed'' is a commonly used slang name for cannabis. New slang names, like ''trees'', came into use early in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name="Lexicon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PittNews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Westword"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.westword.com/marijuana/dea-issues-helpful-list-of-marijuana-slang-9154114 |title=The ABCs of Marijuana Slang From the DEA |last=McKee Simmons, Kate |date=June 16, 2017 |website=[[Westword]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MAVO Dance.jpg|thumb|MAVO Dance]]

'''MAVO''' was a radical Japanese art movement of the 1920s. Founded in 1923, as a re-institution of the Japanese Association of Futurist Artists, the anarchistic artist group displayed an outdoor exhibit in Ueno Park in Tokyo in protest of conservatism in the Japanese art world. The group leader was [[Tomoyoshi Murayama]] (1901 - 1977). The group deployed an interdisciplinary array of performance art, painting, illustration and architecture, to communicate anti-establishment messages to the mainstream. Fueled by responses to industrial development, the MAVO group created works about crisis, peril and uncertainty. Art Historian, [[Gennifer Weisenfeld]] has written that Mavo sought to reintegrate art into daily life.  Other artists involved in the movement include [[Masamu Yanase]], [[Kamenosuke Ogata]], [[Shuzo Oura]] and [[Shinro Kadowaki]], and later [[Osamu Shibuya]], [[Shuichiro Kinoshita]], [[Iwane Sumiya]], [[Tatsuo Okada]], [[Michinao Takamizawa]], [[Kimimaro Yabashi]], [[Tatsuo Todai]], [[Masao Kato]] and [[Kyojiro Haiwara]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weisenfeld|first1=Gennifer|title=Mavo: Japanese Artists and the Avant-Garde, 1905-1931|date=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520223387|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520223387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wang|first1=Yang|title=Russia Constructed: the Practice of Avant-gardism in Taisho-era Japan, 1912-1926|date=December 2009|url=https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/1811/.../1/New_RU_JP_Hayes.pdf|website=osu.edu|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;“Mavoist” artists sought to disrupt or blur the boundaries between art and daily life. They rebelled against the establishment by combining industrial products with painting or printmaking, usually in collage form. Their performance art protests against social injustice deployed theatrical eroticism, that mocked public norms for morality at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monskop.org|title=MAVO|url=http://monoskop.org/Mavo|website=Monoskop|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

During the 1923 demonstration, [[Takamizawa Michinao]], one of the members of MAVO, threw rocks in protest, through a glass ceiling of a building housing an exhibition of artworks curated by Nika-kai (The Second Society). Nika-kai was established in 1914 to oppose the conservative [[Bunten]], the governmental Ministry of Education Exhibition. Murayama had spent 1922 in Berlin where he became familiar with the social satire painting of [[Georg Grosz]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]]'s "spiritual" abstract paintings, [[El Lissitzky]]'s constructivist works, and [[Alexander Archipenko]]'s sculptures. As a cultural leader and public figure, Murayama had a confident, flamboyant personality, an androgynous physical presence sporting a bob-hairstyle, and posing for photographs in states of undress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Larking|first1=Matthew|title=Mavo, the movement that rocked Japan’s art scene|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2012/04/26/arts/mavo-the-movement-that-rocked-japans-art-scene-2/#.VttW5ulE90A|accessdate=5 March 2016|publisher=The Japan Times|date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazine==

Tatsuo Okada and Tomoyoshi Murayama edited MAVO magazine, that published seven issues between July 1924 and August 1925. The publication included essays on socio-cultural art, poetry, and theatrical texts. The pages included original linocut prints and photographic reproductions of visual art that often appropriated the work of their own members. Reuse and recycling from one project to another was one of the group's trademark strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=William|title=Poetry and New Media: An Essay on the 1920's Avant-garde, Focusing on Hagiwara Kyojiro's "Advertising Tower !"  詩と新メディア : 萩原恭次郎の｢広告塔！｣を中心にした一九二〇年代のアヴァンギャルド論考|journal=Comparative Literature and Culture|date=1999|issue=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists' books==

Several members of the group produced short-run artist's books including Hagiwara Kyojiro's ''Shikei senkoku'' (Death Sentence), an anthology of visual poetry published in 1925, and illustrated by MAVO; Ernst Toller's ''Tsubame no sho'', (The Swallow Book) illustrated by Tatsuo Okada and translated by Tomoyoshi Murayama (1925); and Hideo Saito's ''Aozameta douteikyo'',  (The Pale-faced Virgin's Mad Thoughts) visual poetry published in 1926 and illustrated by Tatsuo Okada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weisenfeld|first1=Gennifer|title=Mavo's Conscious Constructivism: Art, Individualism, and Daily Life in Interwar Japan|journal=Art Journal|date=Autumn 1996|volume=55|issue=3|pages=64–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medical journalism''' is news reporting (as opposed to peer-review publication) of medical news and features. Medical journalism is diverse, and reflects its audience. The main division is into (1) medical journalism for the general public, which includes medical coverage in general news publications and in specialty medical publications, and (2) medical journalism for doctors and other professionals, which often appears in peer-reviewed journals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mjauk.org/about/ Medical Journalists' Association (UK)]&lt;/ref&gt; The accuracy of medical journalism varies widely. Reviews of mass media publications have graded most stories unsatisfactory, although there were examples of excellence.&lt;ref name="Schwitzer-JAMAIM"&gt;{{cite journal| title =A guide to reading health care news stories.| journal =JAMA Intern.

| pmid =22286507| pmc =3267473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some web sites, such as [[Columbia Journalism Review]] and [[Hippocrates Med Review]], publish and review medical journalism.

== Sources ==
Medical journalism can come from a variety of sources including:
* Television news programs
* Newspapers
* Internet websites
* Scientific journals (those that report health- and medical-related news)

== Accuracy ==

Most inaccuracies and speculations in news coverage can be attributed to several barriers between the scientific community and the general public that include lack of knowledge by reporters, lack of time to prepare a proper report, and lack of space in the publication.&lt;ref name=Larsson&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Larsson A, Oxman AD, Carling C, Herrin J |title= Medical messages in the media—barriers and solutions to improving medical journalism |journal= Health Expect |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=323–31 |year=2003 |pmid=15040794 |pmc= 5060204 |doi=10.1046/j.1369-7625.2003.00228.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most news articles fail to discuss important issues such as evidence quality, costs, and risks versus benefits.&lt;ref name=Schwitzer&gt;{{cite journal |author= Schwitzer G |title= How Do US Journalists Cover Treatments, Tests, Products, and Procedures? An Evaluation of 500 Stories |journal= PLoS Med |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=e95 |year=2008 |pmid=18507496 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050095 |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050095 |laysummary=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/21/2 |laysource=Guardian |laydate=2008-06-21 |pmc= 2689661}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, medical journalism is not only what is being commercialized and covered by news and mass media. There is also another extensive, more academic branch of medical journalism which is based on evidence. Evidence-based research is more accurate and thus it is a much more reliable source than medical news disseminated by tabloids. Medical journalism in this regard is a professional field and is often disregarded. There are also some medical journalism institutions that provide assistance to medical researchers to enable them to perform more reliable studies. A 2009 study found small improvements in some areas of medical reporting in Australia, but the overall quality remained poor, particularly in commercial human-interest television programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Wilson A, Bonevski B, Jones A, Henry D |title= Media Reporting of Health Interventions: Signs of Improvement, but Major Problems Persist |journal= PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=e4831 |year=2009 |pmid=19293924 |pmc=2652829 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004831 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004831 |editor1-last= Gluud |editor1-first= Lise Lotte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the use of [[Medical writing|medical writers]] has become more popular as a way to produce medical literature that is clear, concise, and easier to read by the lay person.

The [http://www.icmje.org/ ICMJE], International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, is a committee that specifically deals with this kind of issue.  This organization is committed to keeping medical reporting as true as possible by setting a standard known as URM, or the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts.  These requirements do not only specify technical points such as bibliographical references and copyrights but also regarding ethical issues that may arise.  For example, a submitter must disclose any personal or professional relationships that might even slightly have a bearing on the submitted work.

To this end, it is not uncommon for researchers to hold a press conference or interviews before publishing significant research to prevent any misconstruing of any data or methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICMJE Uniform Requirements of Manuscripts|url=http://www.icmje.org/publishing_9media.html|publisher=International Committee of Medical Journal Editors|accessdate=12 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111091852/http://www.icmje.org/publishing_9media.html|archivedate=11 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflict of interest ==

===Between scientists and journalists===
A large gap divides the scientific and journalist communities when it comes to deciding what is newsworthy.  The ongoing nature of peer review in the scientific community makes it difficult to report interesting advances in scientific discovery. Consequently, this can create a focus on the negative aspects of medicine and science; causing journalists to report on the mistakes of doctors or misconstruing the results of research. However, journalists are not the only ones to fault as scientists have also broadcast their promising initial research to the media in attempts to secure future funding.&lt;ref name=Nelkin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelkin|first=Dorothy|title=An Uneasy Relationship: The Tensions between Medicine and the Media.|journal=Lancet|date=June 1996|volume=347|issue=1905|pages=1600–1603|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(96)91081-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, research done by George Washington University in 1993 on in-vitro fertilization was warped by the media into a horrific foray into human cloning.

===Due to corporate influence===
Medical journalists also face challenges due to potential conflicts of interest. The pharmaceutical industry has sponsored journalism contests that carry large prizes in cash or in overseas trips. The [[Association of Health Care Journalists]] (AHCJ) urges journalists to consider these contests carefully before entering, and most journalists avoid them. The Center for Excellence in Health Care Journalism, the supporting 501(c)(3) for AHCJ, does not accept industry funding. The [[National Association of Science Writers]] does not accept such funding. The changing nature of news media has caused more reporters to work freelance, outside of traditional news organizations such as major metropolitan newspapers, which may have created more ways to sidestep conflict-of-interest standards, and the rise of blogs has allowed nontraditional providers of news that lack these standards entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Greene J |title= Pharma's influence on the fourth estate: health care journalists' conflicts also scrutinized |journal= Ann Emerg Med |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=18A–20A |year=2009 |pmid=19244660 |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2009.01.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the effect of direct corporate investments in research funding.  While appreciated by scientists, this may cause conflicts with journalists that see this as profiteering.&lt;ref name=Nelkin/&gt;

== Reviews ==

Sources for evaluating health care media coverage include the review websites Behind the Headlines, [[Health News Review]], and Media Doctor (see ''[[#External links|External links]]''), along with specialized academic journals such as the ''Journal of Health Communication''. Reviews can also appear in the ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'', the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', [[Ben Goldacre]]'s "Bad Science" column in ''[[The Guardian]]'', and others. Health News Review has published criteria for rating news stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthnewsreview.org/how_we_rate.php |accessdate=2009-03-26 |year=2008 |publisher=Health News Review |title=How we rate stories |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110012618/http://www.healthnewsreview.org/how_we_rate.php |archivedate=January 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on the general public ==
Although medical news articles often deliver public health messages effectively, they often convey wrong or misleading information about health care, partly when reporters do not know or cannot convey the results of clinical studies, and partly when they fail to supply reasonable context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Dentzer S |title= Communicating medical news—pitfalls of health care journalism |journal= N Engl J Med |volume=360 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |year=2009 |pmid=19118299 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp0805753 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/360/1/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result in unrealistic expectations due to coverage of radical medical procedures and experimental technology.&lt;ref name=Larsson/&gt; Mass media news outlets can also create a "communications storm" to shift attention to a single health issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carducci|first=Annalaura|author2=Simona Alfani|title=Mass media health information: Quantitative and qualitative analysis of daily press coverage and its relation with public perceptions|journal=Patient Education and Counseling|year=2011|volume=82|issue=3|pages=475–478|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2010.12.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lack of health knowledge in the general public creates a situation where a person can be easily swayed to a certain point of view that is cast in the manner in which information is reported. Consequently, this can create a potentially unhealthy focus on an illness that in actuality is relatively rare.

Medical journalism can also influence an individual's quality of health care. Due to the relative ease at which information can be obtained on the internet, many people will now question doctors on new medications and treatments for their conditions. In more extreme cases, people will compare their symptoms, real or imagined, to various illnesses in attempts to diagnose themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suziedelyte|first=Agne|title=How does searching for health information on the Internet affect individuals' demand for health care services?|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=August 2012|volume=75|issue=10|pages=1828–1835|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.07.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a few recent studies that have tried to explore the availability of health information as complement to health care or as a substitute yet no direct relationships have been found. This is most likely caused by a lack of knowledge or a lack of the ability in the individual to apply the health information once found resulting in seeking health care.

== Training ==
Only a handful of universities and institutes globally offer undergraduate, postgraduate or diploma level programs related to medical journalism. The University of Westminster, UK conducts a BA Honors in Medical Journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Westminster Website|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/courses/subjects/journalism-and-mass-communication/undergraduate-courses/full-time/d09fumej-ba-honours-medical-journalism|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, Boston University via its College of Communication conducts a Science and Medical Journalism program leading to a Master's of Science Degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston University Website|url=http://www.bu.edu/com/academics/journalism/graduate/science-journalism/curriculum/|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those looking for an online mode of education, the James Lind Institute conducts Diploma and Advanced Diploma programs related to Scientific Writing and Medical Journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Lind Institute Website|url=http://www.jli.edu.in/diploma_sw_mj.php|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The [[causes of mental disorders]] are often unclear. Theories may incorporate findings from a range of fields. Mental disorders are usually defined by a combination of how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; This may be associated with particular regions or functions of the brain, often in a [[society|social context]]. A mental disorder is one aspect of [[mental health]]. Cultural and religious beliefs, as well as [[Norm (social)|social norms]], should be taken into account when making a diagnosis.&lt;ref name=DSM5pg101&gt;{{cite book| author= American Psychiatric Association |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |publisher= American Psychiatric Publishing |location= Arlington |isbn=978-0-89042-555-8 |pages= 101–5 |edition= 5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and prevention --&gt;
[[Services for mental disorders|Services]] are based in [[psychiatric hospitals]] or in the [[community mental health services|community]], and assessments are carried out by mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, and [[social work|clinical social workers]], using various methods such as [[psychometric tests]] but often relying on observation and questioning. Treatments are provided by various mental health professionals. [[Psychotherapy]] and [[psychiatric medication]] are two major treatment options. Other treatments include social interventions, [[peer support]], and [[self-help]]. In a minority of cases there might be [[involuntary commitment|involuntary detention]] or [[involuntary treatment|treatment]]. Prevention programs have been shown to reduce depression.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
Common mental disorders include [[major depressive disorder|depression]], which affects about 400 million, [[dementia]] which affects about 35 million, and [[schizophrenia]], which affects about 21 million people globally.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; [[Social stigma|Stigma]] and [[mentalism (discrimination)|discrimination]] can add to the suffering and [[disability]] associated with mental disorders, leading to various [[social movements]] attempting to increase understanding and challenge [[social exclusion]].

==Definition==
The definition and classification of mental disorders are key issues for researchers as well as service providers and those who may be diagnosed. For a mental state to classify as a disorder, it generally needs to cause dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stein|first=Dan J.|title=What is a mental disorder? A perspective from cognitive-affective science|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry|date=December 2013|volume=58|issue=12|pages=656–62|pmid=24331284|url=http://publications.cpa-apc.org/media.php?mid=1607|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304140000/http://publications.cpa-apc.org/media.php?mid=1607|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=|doi=10.1177/070674371305801202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most international clinical documents use the term mental "disorder", while "illness" is also common. It has been noted that using the term "mental" (i.e., of the [[mind]]) is not necessarily meant to imply separateness from [[brain]] or [[Human body|body]].

According to [[DSM-IV]], a mental disorder is a psychological [[syndrome]] or pattern which is associated with [[mental distress|distress]] (e.g. via a painful [[symptom]]), [[disability]] (impairment in one or more important areas of functioning), increased risk of death, or causes a significant loss of autonomy; however it excludes normal responses such as [[grief]] from loss of a loved one, and also excludes [[Deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]] for political, religious, or societal reasons not arising from a dysfunction in the individual.&lt;ref name=psychol-med&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stein |first1=Dan J |last2=Phillips |first2=K.A |last3=Bolton |first3=D |last4=Fulford |first4= K.W.M |last5=Sadler |first5=J.Z |last6=Kendler |first6=K.S  |date=November 2010 |title=What is a Mental/Psychiatric Disorder?

In addition, this syndrome or pattern must not be merely an expectable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, for example, the death of a loved one. Whatever its original cause, it must currently be considered a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual. Neither deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) nor conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict is a symptom of a dysfunction in the individual, as described above. |pmc=3101504 |pmid=20624327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=psychol-med-T1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stein |first1=Dan J |last2=Phillips |first2=K.A |last3=Bolton |first3=D |last4=Fulford |first4= K.W.M |last5=Sadler |first5=J.Z |last6=Kendler |first6=K.S  |date=November 2010 |title=What is a Mental/Psychiatric Disorder?

DSM-IV precedes the definition with caveats, stating that, as in the case with many medical terms, ''mental disorder'' "lacks a consistent operational definition that covers all situations", noting that different levels of abstraction can be used for medical definitions, including pathology, symptomology, deviance from a normal range, or etiology, and that the same is true for mental disorders, so that sometimes one type of definition is appropriate, and sometimes another, depending on the situation.&lt;ref name=dsm4-caveats&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stein |first1=Dan J |last2=Phillips |first2=K.A |last3=Bolton |first3=D |last4=Fulford |first4= K.W.M |last5=Sadler |first5=J.Z |last6=Kendler |first6=K.S  |date=November 2010 |title=What is a Mental/Psychiatric Disorder?

|quote=&lt;!--long quote per fair use and to mitigate linkrot due to robots exclusion--&gt;... although this manual provides a classification of mental disorders, it must be admitted that no definition adequately specifies precise boundaries for the concept of ‘mental disorder.’ The concept of mental disorder, like many other concepts in medicine and science, lacks a consistent operational definition that covers all situations. All medical conditions are defined on various levels of abstraction—for example, structural pathology (e.g., ulcerative colitis), symptom presentation (e.g., migraine), deviance from a physiological norm (e.g., hypertension), and etiology (e.g., pneumococcal pneumonia). Mental disorders have also been defined by a variety of concepts (e.g., distress, dyscontrol, disadvantage, disability, inflexibility, irrationality, syndromal pattern, etiology, and statistical deviation).

In 2013, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) redefined mental disorders in the [[DSM-5]] as "a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Use of the Manual |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|edition= 5th|chapter-url=http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596.UseofDSM5 |url=http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/book/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596 |url-access=subscription |author=American Psychiatric Association|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|accessdate=10 May 2017 |doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596.UseofDSM5 |isbn=978-0-89042-559-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final draft of [[ICD-11]] contains a very similar definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http%3a%2f%2fid.who.int%2ficd%2fentity%2f334423054|title=Chapter 6 on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders|last=|first=|date=|website=ICD-11 for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics, 2018 version|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''How Everyone Became Depressed: The Rise and Fall of the Nervous Breakdown'' (2013), Edward Shorter, a professor of psychiatry and the history of medicine, argues for a return to the old-fashioned concept of nervous illness:
{{quote|About half of them are depressed. Or at least that is the diagnosis that they got when they were put on antidepressants. ... They go to work but they are unhappy and uncomfortable; they are somewhat anxious; they are tired; they have various physical pains – and they tend to obsess about the whole business. There is a term for what they have, and it is a good old-fashioned term that has gone out of use. They have nerves or a nervous illness. It is an illness not just of mind or brain, but a disorder of the entire body. ... We have a package here of five symptoms–mild depression, some anxiety, fatigue, somatic pains, and obsessive thinking. ... We have had nervous illness for centuries. When you are too nervous to function ... it is a nervous breakdown. But that term has vanished from medicine, although not from the way we speak. ... The nervous patients of yesteryear are the depressives of today. That is the bad news. ... There is a deeper illness that drives depression and the symptoms of mood. We can call this deeper illness something else, or invent a neologism, but we need to get the discussion off depression and onto this deeper disorder in the brain and body.

==Classifications==
{{Main|Classification of mental disorders}}

There are currently two widely established systems that classify mental disorders:

* ''[[ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders]]'', since 1949 part of the [[International Classification of Diseases]] produced by the WHO,
*  the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-5) produced by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) since 1952.

Both of these list categories of disorder and provide standardized criteria for diagnosis. They have deliberately converged their codes in recent revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable, although significant differences remain. Other classification schemes may be used in non-western cultures, for example the ''[[Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders]]'', and other manuals may be used by those of alternative theoretical persuasions, for example the ''[[Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual]]''. In general, mental disorders are classified separately from [[neurological disorders]], [[learning disabilities]] or [[intellectual disability]].

Unlike the DSM and ICD, some approaches are not based on identifying distinct categories of disorder using [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] symptom profiles intended to separate the abnormal from the normal. There is significant scientific debate about the relative merits of categorical versus such non-categorical (or hybrid) schemes, also known as [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] or dimensional models. A [[spectrum approach]] may incorporate elements of both.

In the scientific and academic literature on the definition or classification of mental disorder, one extreme argues that it is entirely a matter of value judgements (including of what is [[norm (sociology)|norm]]al) while another proposes that it is or could be entirely [[objectivity (science)|objective]] and [[scientific]] (including by reference to statistical norms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1440-1614.1999.00555.x |title=Classifications in psychiatry: A conceptual history |year=1999 |last1=Berrios |first1=German E. |journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=145–60 |pmid=10336212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common hybrid views argue that the concept of mental disorder is objective even if only a "fuzzy [[prototype]]" that can never be precisely defined, or conversely that the concept always involves a mixture of scientific facts and subjective value judgments.&lt;ref&gt;Perring, C. (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-illness/ Mental Illness] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Although the diagnostic categories are referred to as 'disorders', they are presented as medical diseases, but are not validated in the same way as most medical diagnoses. Some neurologists argue that classification will only be reliable and valid when based on neurobiological features rather than clinical interview, while others suggest that the differing ideological and practical perspectives need to be better integrated.&lt;ref name=Katsching&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20148149 |year=2010 |last1=Katschnig |first1=Heinz |title=Are psychiatrists an endangered species?

The DSM and ICD approach remains under attack both because of the implied causality model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |last1=Doward |first1=Jamie |date=11 May 2013 |title= Medicine's big new battleground: does mental illness really exist? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/may/12/medicine-dsm5-row-does-mental-illness-exist |website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because some researchers believe it better to aim at underlying brain differences which can precede symptoms by many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/updates/2013/mental-disorders-as-brain-disorders-thomas-insel-at-tedxcaltech.shtml |title=NIMH » Mental Disorders as Brain Disorders: Thomas Insel at TEDxCaltech |website=National Institute of Mental Health |date=23 April 2013 |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507060046/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/updates/2013/mental-disorders-as-brain-disorders-thomas-insel-at-tedxcaltech.shtml |archivedate=7 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dimensional models===

The high degree of comorbidity between disorders in categorical models such as the DSM and ICD have led some to propose dimensional models.  Studying comorbidity between disorders have demonstrated two latent (unobserved) factors or dimensions in the structure of mental disorders that are thought to possibly reflect etiological processes.  These two dimensions reflect a distinction between internalizing disorders, such as mood or anxiety symptoms, and externalizing disorders such as behavioral or substance abuse symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hankin|first1=BL|last2=Snyder|first2=HR|last3=Gulley|first3=LD|last4=Schweizer|first4=TH|last5=Bijttebier|first5=P|last6=Nelis|first6=S|last7=Toh|first7=G|last8=Vasey|first8=MW|title=Understanding comorbidity among internalizing problems: Integrating latent structural models of psychopathology and risk mechanisms.|journal=Development and Psychopathology|date=November 2016|volume=28|issue=4pt1|pages=987–1012|doi=10.1017/S0954579416000663|pmid=27739389|pmc=5119897}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A single general factor of psychopathology, similar to the [[G factor (psychometrics)|g factor]] for intelligence, has been empirically supported.  The ''p factor'' model supports the internalizing-externalizing distinction, but also supports the formation of a third dimension of thought disorders such as schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caspi|first1=A|last2=Houts|first2=RM|last3=Belsky|first3=DW|last4=Goldman-Mellor|first4=SJ|last5=Harrington|first5=H|last6=Israel|first6=S|last7=Meier|first7=MH|last8=Ramrakha|first8=S|last9=Shalev|first9=I|last10=Poulton|first10=R|last11=Moffitt|first11=TE|title=The p Factor: One General Psychopathology Factor in the Structure of Psychiatric Disorders?|journal=Clinical Psychological Science|date=March 2014|volume=2|issue=2|pages=119–137|doi=10.1177/2167702613497473|pmid=25360393|pmc=4209412}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biological evidence also supports the validity of the internalizing-externalizing structure of mental disorders, with twin and adoption studies supporting heritable factors for externalizing and internalizing disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forbes|first1=MK|last2=Tackett|first2=JL|last3=Markon|first3=KE|last4=Krueger|first4=RF|title=Beyond comorbidity: Toward a dimensional and hierarchical approach to understanding psychopathology across the life span.|journal=Development and Psychopathology|date=November 2016|volume=28|issue=4pt1|pages=971–986|doi=10.1017/S0954579416000651|pmid=27739384|pmc=5098269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gizer|first1=IR|title=Molecular genetic approaches to understanding the comorbidity of psychiatric disorders.|journal=Development and Psychopathology|date=November 2016|volume=28|issue=4pt1|pages=1089–1101|doi=10.1017/S0954579416000717|pmid=27739393|pmc=5079621}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lahey|first1=BB|last2=Krueger|first2=RF|last3=Rathouz|first3=PJ|last4=Waldman|first4=ID|last5=Zald|first5=DH|title=A hierarchical causal taxonomy of psychopathology across the life span.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=February 2017|volume=143|issue=2|pages=142–186|doi=10.1037/bul0000069|pmid=28004947|pmc=5269437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disorders===
{{see also|List of mental disorders as defined by the DSM and ICD}}
There are many different categories of mental disorder, and many different facets of human behavior and personality that can become disordered.&lt;ref name=Gazzaniga&gt;Gazzaniga, M.S., &amp; Heatherton, T.F.

[[Anxiety (mood)|Anxiety]] or [[fear]] that interferes with normal functioning may be classified as an [[anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref name=webMD_types&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-types-illness |title=Mental Health: Types of Mental Illness |accessdate=2009-09-29 |publisher=[[WebMD]] |date=1 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly recognized categories include specific [[phobia]]s, [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[social anxiety disorder]], [[panic disorder]], [[agoraphobia]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

Other affective (emotion/mood) processes can also become disordered. [[Mood disorder]] involving unusually intense and sustained sadness, melancholia, or despair is known as [[major depression]] (also known as unipolar or clinical depression). Milder but still prolonged [[Depression (mood)|depression]] can be diagnosed as [[dysthymia]]. [[Bipolar disorder]] (also known as manic depression) involves abnormally "high" or pressured mood states, known as [[mania]] or [[hypomania]], alternating with normal or depressed moods. The extent to which unipolar and bipolar mood phenomena represent distinct categories of disorder, or mix and merge along a dimension or spectrum of mood, is subject to some scientific debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2005.12.035 |title=The DSM-IV and ICD-10 categories of recurrent \major depressive and bipolar II disorders: Evidence that they lie on a dimensional spectrum |year=2006 |last1=Akiskal |first1=Hagop S. |last2=Benazzi |first2=Franco |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=92 |pages=45–54 |pmid=16488021 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2015}}

Patterns of belief, language use and perception of reality can become disordered (e.g., [[delusions]], [[thought disorder]], [[hallucinations]]). [[Psychotic disorder]]s in this domain include [[schizophrenia]], and [[delusional disorder]]. [[Schizoaffective disorder]] is a category used for individuals showing aspects of both schizophrenia and affective disorders. [[Schizotypy]] is a category used for individuals showing some of the characteristics associated with schizophrenia but without meeting cutoff criteria.

[[Personality development|Personality]]—the fundamental characteristics of a person that influence thoughts and behaviors across situations and time—may be considered disordered if judged to be abnormally rigid and [[maladaptive]]. Although treated separately by some, the commonly used categorical schemes include them as mental disorders, albeit on a separate "[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#Multi axial system|axis&amp;nbsp;II]]" in the case of the DSM-IV. A number of different [[personality disorder]]s are listed, including those sometimes classed as "eccentric", such as [[paranoid personality disorder|paranoid]], [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] and [[schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] personality disorders; types that have described as "dramatic" or "emotional", such as [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]], [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] or [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] personality disorders; and those sometimes classed as fear-related, such as [[avoidant personality disorder|anxious-avoidant]], [[dependent personality disorder|dependent]], or [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder|obsessive-compulsive]] personality disorders. The personality disorders, in general, are defined as emerging in childhood, or at least by adolescence or early adulthood. The ICD also has a category for enduring personality change after a catastrophic experience or psychiatric illness. If an inability to sufficiently adjust to life circumstances begins within three months of a particular event or situation, and ends within six months after the stressor stops or is eliminated, it may instead be classed as an [[adjustment disorder]]. There is an emerging consensus that so-called "personality disorders", like personality traits in general, actually incorporate a mixture of acute dysfunctional behaviors that may resolve in short periods, and maladaptive temperamental traits that are more enduring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190200 |title=Assessment and Diagnosis of Personality Disorder: Perennial Issues and an Emerging Reconceptualization |year=2007 |last1=Clark |first1=Lee Anna |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=58 |pages=227–57 |pmid=16903806 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are also non-categorical schemes that rate all individuals via a profile of different dimensions of personality without a symptom-based cutoff from normal personality variation, for example through schemes based on dimensional models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0033291706009482 |title=Comparison of alternative models for personality disorders |year=2006 |last1=Morey |first1=Leslie C. |last2=Hopwood |first2=Christopher J. |last3=Gunderson |first3=John G. |last4=Skodol |first4=Andrew E. |last5=Shea |first5=M.

[[Eating disorder]]s involve disproportionate concern in matters of food and weight.&lt;ref name=webMD_types /&gt; Categories of disorder in this area include [[anorexia nervosa]], [[bulimia nervosa]], [[exercise bulimia]] or [[binge eating disorder]].

[[Sleep disorder]]s such as [[insomnia]] involve disruption to normal [[sleep]] patterns, or a feeling of tiredness despite sleep appearing normal.

[[Sexual disorder]]s and [[gender dysphoria]] may be diagnosed, including [[dyspareunia]] and [[egodystonic sexual orientation|ego-dystonic homosexuality]]. Various kinds of [[paraphilia]] are considered mental disorders (sexual arousal to objects, situations, or individuals that are considered abnormal or harmful to the person or others).

People who are abnormally unable to resist certain urges or impulses that could be harmful to themselves or others, may be classed as having an impulse control disorder, and disorders such as [[kleptomania]] (stealing) or [[pyromania]] (fire-setting). Various behavioral addictions, such as [[gambling]] addiction, may be classed as a disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder can sometimes involve an inability to resist certain acts but is classed separately as being primarily an anxiety disorder.

The use of drugs (legal or illegal, including [[alcoholic beverages|alcohol]]), when it persists despite significant problems related to its use, may be defined as a mental disorder. The DSM incorporates such conditions under the umbrella category of [[substance use disorders]], which includes [[substance dependence]] and [[substance abuse]]. The DSM does not currently use the common term drug addiction, and the ICD simply refers to "harmful use". Disordered substance use may be due to a pattern of compulsive and repetitive use of the drug that results in tolerance to its effects and withdrawal symptoms when use is reduced or stopped.

People who suffer severe disturbances of their self-identity, memory and general awareness of themselves and their surroundings may be classed as having a [[dissociative identity disorder]], such as [[depersonalization disorder]] or Dissociative Identity Disorder itself (which has also been called multiple personality disorder, or "split personality"). Other memory or [[cognitive disorder]]s include [[amnesia]] or various kinds of old age [[dementia]].

A range of [[developmental disorders]] that initially occur in childhood may be diagnosed, for example [[autism spectrum]] disorders, [[oppositional defiant disorder]] and [[conduct disorder]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), which may continue into adulthood.

Conduct disorder, if continuing into adulthood, may be diagnosed as [[antisocial personality disorder]] (dissocial personality disorder in the ICD). Popularist labels such as [[psychopath]] (or sociopath) do not appear in the DSM or ICD but are linked by some to these diagnoses.

Somatoform disorders may be diagnosed when there are problems that appear to originate in the body that are thought to be manifestations of a mental disorder. This includes [[somatization disorder]] and [[conversion disorder]]. There are also disorders of how a person perceives their body, such as [[body dysmorphic disorder]]. [[Neurasthenia]] is an old diagnosis involving somatic complaints as well as fatigue and low spirits/depression, which is officially recognized by the ICD-10 but no longer by the DSM-IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00406-006-0699-6 |title=The spectra of neurasthenia and depression: Course, stability and transitions |year=2006 |last1=Gamma |first1=Alex |last2=Angst |first2=Jules |last3=Ajdacic |first3=Vladeta |last4=Eich |first4=Dominique |last5=Rössler |first5=Wulf |journal=European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience |volume=257 |issue=2 |pages=120–7 |pmid=17131216}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2015}}

[[Factitious disorder]]s, such as [[Munchausen syndrome]], are diagnosed where symptoms are thought to be experienced (deliberately produced) and/or reported (feigned) for personal gain.

There are attempts to introduce a category of [[relational disorder]], where the diagnosis is of a relationship rather than on any one individual in that relationship. The relationship may be between children and their parents, between couples, or others. There already exists, under the category of psychosis, a diagnosis of [[shared psychotic disorder]] where two or more individuals share a particular delusion because of their close relationship with each other.

There are a number of uncommon psychiatric [[syndromes]], which are often named after the person who first described them, such as [[Capgras syndrome]], [[De&amp;nbsp;Clerambault syndrome]], [[Othello syndrome]], [[Ganser syndrome]], [[Cotard delusion]], and [[Delusional parasitosis|Ekbom syndrome]], and additional disorders such as the [[Couvade syndrome]] and [[Geschwind syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.73.2.211-c |title=Uncommon psychiatric syndromes, 4th edn |year=2002 |last1=Trimble |first1=Michael |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=211–c |pmc=1738003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various new types of mental disorder diagnosis are occasionally proposed. Among those controversially considered by the official [[committees]] of the diagnostic manuals include [[self-defeating personality disorder]], [[sadistic personality disorder]], [[passive-aggressive personality disorder]] and [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]].

Two recent unique unofficial proposals are [[solastalgia]] by [[Glenn Albrecht]] and hubris syndrome by [[David Owen]]. The application of the concept of [[mental illness]] to the phenomena described by these authors has in turn been critiqued by Seamus Mac Suibhne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacSuibhne |first1=Seamus P |year=2009 |title=What makes 'a mental illness?'

==Signs and symptoms==

===Course===
The likely course and outcome of mental disorders varies and is dependent on numerous factors related to the disorder itself, the individual as a whole, and the social environment. Some disorders are transient, while others may be more chronic in nature.

Even those disorders often considered the most serious and intractable have varied courses i.e. schizophrenia, psychotic disorders, and personality disorders. Long-term international studies of schizophrenia have found that over a half of individuals recover in terms of symptoms, and around a fifth to a third in terms of symptoms and functioning, with many requiring no medication. While some have serious difficulties and support needs for many years, "late" recovery is still plausible. The [[World Health Organization]] concluded that the long-term studies' findings converged with others in "relieving patients, carers and clinicians of the chronicity paradigm which dominated thinking throughout much of the 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.178.6.506 |title=Recovery from psychotic illness: A 15- and 25-year international follow-up study |year=2001 |last1=Harrison |first1=G. |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=178 |issue=6 |pages=506–17 |pmid=11388966 |last2=Hopper |first2=K |last3=Craig |first3=T |last4=Laska |first4=E |last5=Siegel |first5=C |last6=Wanderling |first6=J |last7=Dube |first7=KC |last8=Ganev |first8=K |last9=Giel |first9=R |last10=An Der Heiden |first10=W |last11=Holmberg |first11=SK |last12=Janca |first12=A |last13=Lee |first13=PW |last14=León |first14=CA |last15=Malhotra |first15=S |last16=Marsella |first16=AJ |last17=Nakane |first17=Y |last18=Sartorius |first18=N |last19=Shen |first19=Y |last20=Skoda |first20=C |last21=Thara |first21=R |last22=Tsirkin |first22=SJ |last23=Varma |first23=VK |last24=Walsh |first24=D |last25=Wiersma |first25=D}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref name="Jobe2005"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16494258 |year=2005 |last1=Jobe |first1=TH |last2=Harrow |first2=M |title=Long-term outcome of patients with schizophrenia: A review |volume=50 |issue=14 |pages=892–900 |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around half of people initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder achieve syndromal recovery (no longer meeting criteria for the diagnosis) within six weeks, and nearly all achieve it within two years, with nearly half regaining their prior occupational and residential status in that period.

===Disability===
Some disorders may be very limited in their functional effects, while others may involve substantial disability and support needs. The degree of ability or disability may vary over time and across different life domains. Furthermore, continued disability has been linked to [[institutionalization]], [[mentalism (discrimination)|discrimination]] and [[social exclusion]] as well as to the inherent effects of disorders. Alternatively, functioning may be affected by the stress of having to hide a condition in work or school etc., by adverse effects of medications or other substances, or by mismatches between illness-related variations and demands for regularity.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation [http://www.bu.edu/cpr/reasaccom/whatis-psych.html What is Psychiatric Disability and Mental Illness?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104041024/http://www.bu.edu/cpr/reasaccom/whatis-psych.html |date=2012-01-04 }} Boston University, Retrieved January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the case that, while often being characterized in purely negative terms, some mental traits or states labeled as disorders can also involve above-average creativity, non-conformity, goal-striving, meticulousness, or empathy.&lt;ref name="Rogers&amp;Pilgram05"/&gt; In addition, the public perception of the level of disability associated with mental disorders can change.&lt;ref&gt;Ferney, V. (2003) [http://www.nycvoices.org/article.php?article_id=585 The Hierarchy of Mental Illness: Which diagnosis is the least debilitating?] ''New York City Voices'' Jan/March&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, internationally, people report equal or greater disability from commonly occurring mental conditions than from commonly occurring physical conditions, particularly in their social roles and personal relationships. The proportion with access to professional help for mental disorders is far lower, however, even among those assessed as having a severely disabling condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.107.039107 |title=Disability and treatment of specific mental and physical disorders across the world |year=2008 |last1=Ormel |first1=Johan |last2=Petukhova |first2=Maria |last3=Chatterji |first3=Somnath |last4=Aguilar-Gaxiola |first4=Sergio |last5=Alonso |first5=Jordi |last6=Angermeyer |first6=Matthias C. |last7=Bromet |first7=Evelyn J. |last8=Burger |first8=Huibert |last9=Demyttenaere |first9=Koen |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=192 |issue=5 |pages=368–75 |pmid=18450663 |pmc=2681238 |last10=De Girolamo |first10=G. |last11=Haro |first11=J.

R. |last23=Zhang |first23=M. |last24=Kessler |first24=R. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disability in this context may or may not involve such things as:

* Basic [[activities of daily living]]. Including looking after the self (health care, grooming, dressing, shopping, cooking etc.) or looking after accommodation (chores, DIY tasks, etc.)
* [[Interpersonal relationships]]. Including [[communication skills]], ability to form relationships and sustain them, ability to leave the home or mix in crowds or particular settings
* Occupational functioning. Ability to acquire a [[employment]] and hold it, cognitive and social skills required for the job, dealing with [[workplace]] culture, or studying as a student.

In terms of total [[Disability-adjusted life years]] (DALYs), which is an estimate of how many years of life are lost due to premature death or to being in a state of poor health and disability, mental disorders rank amongst the most disabling conditions. Unipolar (also known as Major) depressive disorder is the third leading cause of disability worldwide, of any condition mental or physical, accounting for 65.5 million years lost. The total DALY does not necessarily indicate what is the most individually disabling because it also depends on how common a condition is; for example, schizophrenia is found to be the most individually disabling mental disorder on average but is less common. Alcohol-use disorders are also high in the overall list, responsible for 23.7 million DALYs globally, while other drug-use disorders accounted for 8.4 million. Schizophrenia causes a total loss of 16.8 million DALY, and bipolar disorder 14.4 million. Panic disorder leads to 7 million years lost, obsessive-compulsive disorder 5.1, primary insomnia 3.6, and post-traumatic stress disorder 3.5 million DALYs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/475027a |title=Grand challenges in global mental health |year=2011 |last1=Collins |first1=Pamela Y. |last2=Patel |first2=Vikram |last3=Joestl |first3=Sarah S. |last4=March |first4=Dana |last5=Insel |first5=Thomas R. |last6=Daar |first6=Abdallah S. |last7=Bordin |first7=Isabel A. |last8=Anderson |first8=E.

The first ever systematic description of global disability arising in youth, published in 2011, found that among 10- to 24-year-olds nearly half of all disability (current and as estimated to continue) was due to mental and neurological conditions, including substance use disorders and conditions involving [[self-harm]]. Second to this were accidental injuries (mainly traffic collisions) accounting for 12 percent of disability, followed by communicable diseases at 10 percent. The disorders associated with most disability in high income countries were unipolar major depression (20%) and alcohol use disorder (11%). In the eastern Mediterranean region it was unipolar major depression (12%) and schizophrenia (7%), and in Africa it was unipolar major depression (7%) and bipolar disorder (5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60512-6 |title=Global burden of disease in young people aged 10–24 years: A systematic analysis |year=2011 |last1=Gore |first1=Fiona M |last2=Bloem |first2=Paul JN |last3=Patton |first3=George C |last4=Ferguson |first4=Jane |last5=Joseph |first5=Véronique |last6=Coffey |first6=Carolyn |last7=Sawyer |first7=Susan M |last8=Mathers |first8=Colin D |journal=The Lancet |volume=377 |issue=9783 |pages=2093–102 |pmid=21652063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In schizophrenia and psychosis, risk factors include migration and discrimination, childhood trauma, bereavement or separation in families, abuse of drugs,&lt;ref name="schizophreniacommission.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schizophreniacommission.org.uk/the-report/ |title=The Report |publisher=The Schizophrenia Commission |date=2012-11-13 |accessdate=2013-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405104051/http://www.schizophreniacommission.org.uk/the-report/ |archivedate=2013-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and urbanicity.&lt;ref name="Krabbendam"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Krabbendam, L., Van Os, J. | year = 2005 | title = Schizophrenia and Urbanicity: A Major Environmental Influence – Conditional on Genetic Risk

In anxiety, risk factors may include parenting factors including parental rejection, lack of parental warmth, high hostility, harsh discipline, high maternal negative affect, anxious childrearing, modelling of dysfunctional and drug-abusing behaviour, and child abuse (emotional, physical and sexual).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12480&amp;page=530 |chapter=Table E-4 Risk Factors for Anxiety |page=530 |editor1-first=Mary Ellen |editor1-last=O'Connell |editor2-first=Thomas |editor2-last=Boat |editor3-first=Kenneth E. |editor3-last=Warner |publisher=National Academies Press |title=Prevention of Mental Disorders, Substance Abuse, and Problem Behaviors: A Developmental Perspective |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-309-12674-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[bipolar disorder]], stress (such as childhood adversity) is not a specific cause, but does place genetically and biologically vulnerable individuals at risk for a more severe course of illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0954579408000424 |title=Prevention of bipolar disorder in at-risk children: Theoretical assumptions and empirical foundations |year=2008 |last1=Miklowitz |first1=David J. |last2=Chang |first2=Kiki D. |journal=Development and Psychopathology |volume=20 |issue=3 |pmid=18606036 |pages=881–97 |pmc=2504732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social influences have also been found to be important,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hiday|first1=VA|title=The social context of mental illness and violence|journal=Journal of health and social behavior|date=June 1995|volume=36|issue=2|pages=122–37|pmid=9113138|doi=10.2307/2137220|jstor=2137220}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[abuse]], [[neglect]], [[bullying]], [[social stress]], [[Traumatic event (psychological)|traumatic events]], and other negative or overwhelming life experiences. Aspects of the wider community have also been implicated,&lt;ref name="Krabbendam" /&gt; including [[employment]] problems, [[socioeconomic]] [[Economic inequality|inequality]], lack of social cohesion, problems linked to [[Human migration|migration]], and features of particular [[societies]] and [[cultures]]. The specific risks and pathways to particular disorders are less clear, however.

===Models===
Mental disorders can arise from multiple sources, and in many cases there is no single accepted or consistent cause currently established. An [[wikt:eclectic|eclectic]] or [[Scientific pluralism|pluralistic]] mix of models may be used to explain particular disorders.&lt;ref name="Ormel2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kendler2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Kendler, K.S.|year=2012|title= The dappled nature of causes of psychiatric illness: replacing the organic-functional/hardware-software dichotomy with empirically based pluralism|volume=17|issue=4|pages=377–88|pmid=22230881|pmc=3312951|doi=10.1038/mp.2011.182|journal=Mol Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary paradigm of contemporary mainstream Western psychiatry is said to be the [[biopsychosocial model]] which incorporates biological, psychological and social factors, although this may not always be applied in practice.

[[Biological psychiatry]] follows a [[biomedical]] model where many mental disorders are conceptualized as disorders of brain circuits likely caused by developmental processes shaped by a complex interplay of genetics and experience. A common assumption is that disorders may have resulted from [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[child development|developmental]] vulnerabilities, exposed by [[stress (biology)|stress]] in life (for example in a [[diathesis–stress model]]), although there are various views on what causes [[individual differences|differences between individuals]]. Some types of mental disorders may be viewed as primarily [[neurodevelopmental disorders]].

[[Evolutionary psychology]] may be used as an overall explanatory theory, while [[attachment theory]] is another kind of evolutionary-psychological approach sometimes applied in the context of mental disorders. [[Psychoanalytic]] theories have continued to evolve alongside and [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]]-[[Behaviorism|behavioral]] and [[Systems psychology|systemic-family]] approaches. A distinction is sometimes made between a "[[medical model]]" or a "[[social model]]" of disorder and disability.

==Diagnosis==
Psychiatrists seek to provide a [[medical diagnosis]] of individuals by an assessment of [[symptoms]], [[medical signs|signs]] and impairment associated with particular types of mental disorder. Other mental health professionals, such as clinical psychologists, may or may not apply the same diagnostic categories to their [[clinical formulation]] of a client's difficulties and circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1352465800003118 |title=Evolving Formulations: Sharing Complex Information with Clients |year=2000 |last1=Kinderman |first1=Peter |last2=Lobban |first2=Fiona |journal=Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=307–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of mental health problems are, at least initially, assessed and treated by family physicians (in the UK [[general practitioners]]) during consultations, who may refer a patient on for more specialist diagnosis in [[acute (medicine)|acute]] or [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] cases.

Routine diagnostic practice in mental health services typically involves an interview known as a [[mental status examination]], where evaluations are made of appearance and behavior, self-reported symptoms, mental health history, and current life circumstances. The views of other professionals, relatives or other third parties may be taken into account. A physical examination to check for ill health or the effects of medications or other drugs may be conducted. [[Psychological testing]] is sometimes used via paper-and-pen or computerized questionnaires, which may include [[algorithms]] based on ticking off standardized diagnostic criteria, and in rare specialist cases neuroimaging tests may be requested, but such methods are more commonly found in research studies than routine clinical practice.&lt;ref&gt;HealthWise (2004) [http://health.yahoo.com/topic/mentalhealth/symptoms/medicaltest/healthwise/tp16780 Mental Health Assessment.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626070720/http://health.yahoo.com/topic/mentalhealth/symptoms/medicaltest/healthwise/tp16780 |date=2006-06-26 }} Yahoo!

There may be specific problems with accurate diagnosis in developing countries.

More structured approaches are being increasingly used to measure levels of mental illness.
* HoNOS is the most widely used measure in English mental health services, being used by at least 61 trusts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is HoNOS? |url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/traininpsychiatry/eventsandcourses/courses/honos/whatishonos.aspx |website=Royal College of Psychiatrists}}&lt;/ref&gt; In HoNOS a score of 0–4 is given for each of 12 factors, based on functional living capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Introduction to HoNOS |url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/traininpsychiatry/eventsandcourses/courses/honos/workingageadults/introduction.aspx |website=Royal College of Psychiatrists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has been supportive of HoNOS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1477-7525-3-76 |date=November 2005 |last1=Pirkis |first1=Jane E |last2=Burgess |first2=Philip M |last3=Kirk |first3=Pia K |last4=Dodson |first4=Sarity |last5=Coombs |first5=Tim J |last6=Williamson |first6=Michelle K |journal=Health and Quality of Life Outcomes |volume=3 |page=76 |pmid=16313678 |title=A review of the psychometric properties of the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) family of measures |pmc=1315350 |issue=1 |url=http://hqlo.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1477-7525-3-76}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some questions have been asked about whether it provides adequate coverage of the range and complexity of mental illness problems, and whether the fact that often only 3 of the 12 scales vary over time gives enough subtlety to accurately measure outcomes of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.178.6.561 |title=Value of HoNOS in assessing patient change in NHS psychotherapy and psychological treatment services |date=June 2001 |last1=Audin |first1=K. |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=178 |issue=6 |pages=561–6 |pmid=11388975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===

Since the 1980s, [[Paula Caplan]] has been concerned about the subjectivity of psychiatric diagnosis, and people being arbitrarily “slapped with a psychiatric label.” Caplan says because psychiatric diagnosis is unregulated, doctors are not required to spend much time interviewing patients or to seek a second opinion.  The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] can lead a psychiatrist to focus on narrow checklists of symptoms, with little consideration of what is actually causing the patient’s problems. So, according to Caplan, getting a psychiatric diagnosis and label often stands in the way of recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/psychiatrys-bible-the-dsm-is-doing-more-harm-than-good/2012/04/27/gIQAqy0WlT_story.html |title=Psychiatry’s bible, the DSM, is doing more harm than good |first=Paula J. |last=Caplan |author-link=Paula Caplan |date=28 April 2012  |newspaper=Washington Post |department=Opinions }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|sure=y|date=October 2015}}

In 2013, psychiatrist [[Allen Frances]] wrote a paper entitled "The New Crisis of Confidence in Psychiatric Diagnosis", which said that "psychiatric diagnosis… still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests." Frances was also concerned about "unpredictable overdiagnosis."&lt;ref name=frana&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frances |first1=Allen |author1-link=Allen Frances |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-159-3-201308060-00655 |doi-access=free |pmid=23685989 |date=6 August 2013 |title=The New Crisis in Confidence in Psychiatric Diagnosis |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=159 |issue=3 |pages=221–2 |department=Ideas and Opinions |quote=Unfortunately, the extensive research has had no effect on psychiatric diagnosis, which still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests. … In the past 20 years, the rate of attention-deficit disorder tripled, the rate of bipolar disorder doubled, and the rate of autism increased more than 20-fold (4). The lesson should be clear that every change in the diagnostic system can lead to unpredictable overdiagnosis. |url=http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1722526 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, marginalized psychiatrists (such as [[Peter Breggin]], [[Thomas Szasz]]) and outside critics (such as [[Stuart A. Kirk]]) have "been accusing psychiatry of engaging in the systematic medicalization of normality." More recently these concerns have come from insiders who have worked for and promoted the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (e.g., [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]], [[Allen Frances]]).&lt;ref name=stuarta&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kirk |first1=S.A. |author1-link=Stuart A.

==Prevention==
{{Main|Prevention of mental disorders}}
The 2004 WHO report "Prevention of Mental Disorders" stated that "Prevention of these disorders is obviously one of the most effective ways to reduce the [disease] burden."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=World Health Organization, Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse |author2=Prevention Research Centre of the Universities of Nijmegen and Maastricht |date=2004 |title=Prevention of mental disorders: effective interventions and policy options: summary report |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |isbn=92-4-159215-X |url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/en/prevention_of_mental_disorders_sr.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2011 [[European Psychiatric Association]] (EPA) guidance on prevention of mental disorders states "There is considerable evidence that various psychiatric conditions can be prevented through the implementation of effective evidence-based interventions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.eurpsy.2011.10.004 |title=European Psychiatric Association (EPA) guidance on prevention of mental disorders |year=2012 |last1=Campion |first1=J. |last2=Bhui |first2=K. |last3=Bhugra |first3=D. |journal=European Psychiatry |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=68–80 |pmid=22285092 |last4=European Psychiatric |first4=Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2011 [[UK Department of Health]] report on the economic case for mental health promotion and mental illness prevention found that "many interventions are outstandingly good value for money, low in cost and often become self-financing over time, saving public expenditure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/businessAndConsultancy/LSEEnterprise/news/2011/healthstrategy.aspx |title=Mental health promotion and mental illness prevention: The economic case |publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science |date=2 February 2011 |accessdate=May 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal prevention (aimed at a population that has no increased risk for developing a mental disorder, such as school programs or mass media campaigns) need very high numbers of people to show effect (sometimes known as the "power" problem). Approaches to overcome this are (1) focus on high-incidence groups (e.g. by targeting groups with high risk factors), (2) use multiple interventions to achieve greater, and thus more statistically valid, effects, (3) use cumulative meta-analyses of many trials, and (4) run very large trials.&lt;ref name="Muñoz et al 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-033109-132040 |title=Prevention of Major Depression |year=2010 |last1=Muñoz |first1=Ricardo F. |last2=Cuijpers |first2=Pim |last3=Smit |first3=Filip |last4=Barrera |first4=Alinne Z. |last5=Leykin |first5=Yan |journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology |volume=6 |pages=181–212 |pmid=20192789}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.8.1385 |title=Examining the Effects of Prevention Programs on the Incidence of New Cases of Mental Disorders: The Lack of Statistical Power |year=2003 |last1=Cuijpers |first1=P. |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=8 |pages=1385–91 |pmid=12900296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment and support for mental disorders is provided in [[psychiatric hospitals]], [[clinics]] or any of a diverse range of [[community mental health services]]. A number of professions have developed that specialize in the treatment of mental disorders. This includes the [[Medicine|medical]] specialty of psychiatry (including psychiatric nursing),&lt;ref name=AJP154Editorial&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9137110 |year=1997 |last1=Andreasen |first1=NC |title=What is psychiatry? |volume=154 |issue=5 |pages=591–3 |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |doi=10.1176/ajp.154.5.591}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UM&gt;{{cite web |publisher=University of Melbourne |date=19 August 2005 |title=What is Psychiatry? |accessdate=April 19, 2007 |url=http://www.psychiatry.unimelb.edu.au/info/what_is_psych.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820104600/http://www.psychiatry.unimelb.edu.au/info/what_is_psych.html |archivedate=August 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CPA&gt;{{cite web |publisher=California Psychiatric Association |date=28 February 2007 |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Psychiatry &amp; Psychiatrists |accessdate=April 19, 2007 |url=http://www.calpsych.org/publications/cpa/faqs.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416210423/http://www.calpsych.org/publications/cpa/faqs.html |archivedate=16 April 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the field of [[psychology]] known as [[clinical psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association, Division 12, http://www.apa.org/divisions/div12/aboutcp.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the practical application of [[sociology]] known as [[social work]].&lt;ref&gt;Golightley, M.

In some countries services are increasingly based on a [[recovery approach]], intended to support each individual's personal journey to gain the kind of life they want, although there may also be 'therapeutic pessimism' in some areas.

There are a range of different types of treatment and what is most suitable depends on the disorder and on the individual. Many things have been found to help at least some people, and a [[placebo]] effect may play a role in any intervention or medication. In a minority of cases, individuals may be treated against their will, which can cause particular difficulties depending on how it is carried out and perceived.

Compulsory treatment while in the community versus non-compulsory treatment does not appear to make much of a difference except by maybe decreasing victimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kisely|first=Steve R.|last2=Campbell|first2=Leslie A.|last3=O'Reilly|first3=Richard|date=2017|title=Compulsory community and involuntary outpatient treatment for people with severe mental disorders|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=3|pages=CD004408|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004408.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28303578|pmc=4393705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychotherapy===
A major option for many mental disorders is [[psychotherapy]]. There are several main types. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is widely used and is based on modifying the patterns of thought and behavior associated with a particular disorder. [[Psychoanalysis]], addressing underlying psychic conflicts and defenses, has been a dominant school of psychotherapy and is still in use. [[Systemic therapy]] or [[family therapy]] is sometimes used, addressing a network of significant others as well as an individual.

Some psychotherapies are based on a [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]] approach. There are a number of specific therapies used for particular disorders, which may be offshoots or hybrids of the above types. Mental health professionals often employ an [[Integrative Psychotherapy|eclectic or integrative approach]]. Much may depend on the [[therapeutic relationship]], and there may be problems with [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[confidentiality]] and [[engagement]].

===Medication===
A major option for many mental disorders is [[psychiatric medication]] and there are several main groups. [[Antidepressants]] are used for the treatment of [[clinical depression]], as well as often for anxiety and a range of other disorders. [[Anxiolytics]] (including [[sedatives]]) are used for anxiety disorders and related problems such as insomnia. [[Mood stabilizers]] are used primarily in bipolar disorder. [[Antipsychotics]] are used for psychotic disorders, notably for [[Schizophrenic reaction|positive symptoms in schizophrenia]], and also increasingly for a range of other disorders. [[Stimulants]] are commonly used, notably for [[ADHD]].

Despite the different conventional names of the drug groups, there may be considerable overlap in the disorders for which they are actually indicated, and there may also be [[off-label use]] of medications. There can be problems with [[adverse effects]] of medication and [[Compliance (medicine)|adherence]] to them, and there is also criticism of [[pharmaceutical marketing]] and professional [[conflicts of interest]].

===Other===
[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) is sometimes used in severe cases when other interventions for severe intractable depression have failed. [[Psychosurgery]] is considered experimental but is advocated by some [[neurologists]] in certain rare cases.&lt;ref&gt;Mind Disorders Encyclopedia [http://www.minddisorders.com/Ob-Ps/Psychosurgery.html Psychosurgery] [Retrieved on August 5th 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2004.09.002 |title=Psychosurgery: Past, present, and future |year=2005 |last1=Mashour |first1=George A. |last2=Walker |first2=Erin E. |last3=Martuza |first3=Robert L. |journal=Brain Research Reviews |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=409–19 |pmid=15914249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Counseling]] (professional) and [[co-counseling]] (between peers) may be used. [[Psychoeducation]] programs may provide people with the information to understand and manage their problems. Creative therapies are sometimes used, including [[music therapy]], [[art therapy]] or [[drama therapy]]. Lifestyle adjustments and supportive measures are often used, including peer support, [[self-help groups for mental health]] and [[supported housing]] or supported employment (including [[social firms]]). Some advocate [[dietary supplements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-7-2 |title=Nutritional therapies for mental disorders |year=2008 |last1=Lakhan |first1=Shaheen E |last2=Vieira |first2=Karen F |journal=Nutrition Journal |volume=7 |page=2 |pmid=18208598 |pmc=2248201 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reasonable accommodation]]s (adjustments and supports) might be put in place to help an individual cope and succeed in environments despite potential disability related to mental health problems. This could include an [[emotional support animal]] or specifically trained [[psychiatric service dog]].

A 2004 cross-Europe study found that approximately one in four people reported meeting criteria at some point in their life for at least one of the DSM-IV disorders assessed, which included mood disorders (13.9%), anxiety disorders (13.6%) or alcohol disorder (5.2%).

Studies of the prevalence of personality disorders (PDs) have been fewer and smaller-scale, but one broad Norwegian survey found a five-year prevalence of almost 1 in 7 (13.4%).

While rates of psychological disorders are often the same for men and women, women tend to have a higher rate of depression. Each year 73 million women are affected by major depression, and suicide is ranked 7th as the cause of death for women between the ages of 20–59. Depressive disorders account for close to 41.9% of the disability from neuropsychiatric disorders among women compared to 29.3% among men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/genderwomen/en/ |title=Gender disparities and mental health: The Facts |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{Main|History of mental disorders}}

===Ancient civilizations===
Ancient civilizations described and treated a number of mental disorders. Mental illnesses were well known in ancient [[Mesopotamia]],&lt;ref name="NemetNejat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nemet-Nejat|first=Karen Rhea|authorlink=Karen Rhea Nemet-Nejat|date=1998|title=Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lbmXsaTGNKUC&amp;pg=PA81|location=Santa Barbara, California|publisher=Greenwood|series=Daily Life|isbn=978-0-313-29497-6|pages=80–81|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; where diseases and mental disorders were believed to be caused by specific deities.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=Jeremy|first2=Anthony|last2=Green|title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05LXAAAAMAAJ|publisher=The British Museum Press|year=1992|isbn=0-7141-1705-6|pages=102|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[hand]]s symbolized control over a person, mental illnesses were known as "hands" of certain deities.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; One psychological illness was known as ''Qāt Ištar'', meaning "Hand of [[Ishtar]]".&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; Others were known as "Hand of [[Shamash]]", "Hand of the Ghost", and "Hand of the God".&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; Descriptions of these illnesses, however, are so vague that it is usually impossible to determine which illnesses they correspond to in modern terminology.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; Mesopotamian doctors kept detailed record of their patients' [[hallucination]]s and assigned spiritual meanings to them.&lt;ref name="NemetNejat"/&gt; The royal family of [[Elam]] was notorious for its members frequently suffering from insanity.&lt;ref name="NemetNejat"/&gt; The Greeks coined terms for [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]], [[hysteria]] and phobia and developed the [[humorism]] theory. Mental disorders were described, and treatments developed, in Persia, Arabia and in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]].

===Europe===

====Middle Ages====
Conceptions of madness in the Middle Ages in Christian Europe were a mixture of the divine, diabolical, magical and humoral and transcendental.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982958263|title=The SAGE encyclopedia of abnormal and clinical psychology|last=|first=|publisher=Sage Publishing|others=Wenzel, Amy,|year=2017|isbn=9781483365831|location=Thousand Oaks, California|pages=|oclc=982958263}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early modern period, some people with mental disorders may have been victims of the witch-hunts.

====Eighteenth century====
[[File:Gautier - Salpetriere.JPG|thumb|Eight patients representing mental diagnoses as of the 19th century at the [[Salpêtrière]], Paris.]]

By the end of the 17th century and into the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], madness was increasingly seen as an organic physical phenomenon with no connection to the soul or moral responsibility. Asylum care was often harsh and treated people like wild animals, but towards the end of the 18th century a [[moral treatment]] movement gradually developed. Clear descriptions of some syndromes may be rare prior to the 19th century.

====Nineteenth century====
[[Industrialization]] and population growth led to a massive expansion of the number and size of insane asylums in every Western country in the 19th century. Numerous different classification schemes and diagnostic terms were developed by different authorities, and the term [[psychiatry]] was coined (1808), though medical superintendents were still known as alienists.

====Twentieth century====
[[File:A mentally ill patient in a strait-jacket attached to the wa Wellcome V0016643ER.jpg|thumb|A patient in a strait-jacket and barrel contraption, 1908]]
The turn of the 20th century saw the development of psychoanalysis, which would later come to the fore, along with [[Kraepelin]]'s classification scheme. Asylum "inmates" were increasingly referred to as "patients", and asylums renamed as hospitals.

===Europe and the United States===
[[File:Insulin shock therapy.jpg|thumb|[[Insulin shock therapy|Insulin shock procedure]], 1950s]]

Early in the 20th century in the United States, a [[mental hygiene]] movement developed, aiming to prevent mental disorders. [[Clinical psychology]] and social work developed as professions. [[World War I]] saw a massive increase of conditions that came to be termed "[[Combat stress reaction|shell shock]]".

[[World War II]] saw the development in the U.S. of a new psychiatric manual for categorizing mental disorders, which along with existing systems for collecting census and hospital statistics led to the first [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) also developed a section on mental disorders. The term [[stress (biological)|stress]], having emerged from [[endocrinology]] work in the 1930s, was increasingly applied to mental disorders.

[[Electroconvulsive therapy]], [[insulin shock therapy]], [[lobotomy|lobotomies]] and the "[[neuroleptic]]" [[chlorpromazine]] came to be used by mid-century. In the 1960s there were many challenges to the concept of [[mental illness]] itself. These challenges came from psychiatrists like Thomas Szasz who argued that mental illness was a myth used to disguise moral conflicts; from sociologists such as [[Erving Goffman]] who said that mental illness was merely another example of how society labels and controls non-conformists; from behavioural psychologists who challenged psychiatry's fundamental reliance on unobservable phenomena; and from gay rights activists who criticised the APA's listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder. A study published in ''Science'' by [[Rosenhan experiment|Rosenhan]] received much publicity and was viewed as an attack on the efficacy of psychiatric diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.academyanalyticarts.org/kirk&amp;kutchins.htm |last1=Kirk |first1=Stuart A. |last2=Kutchins |first2=Herb |date=1994 |title=The Myth of the Reliability of DSM |journal=Journal of Mind and Behavior |volume=15 |issue=1&amp;2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307115815/http://www.academyanalyticarts.org/kirk%26kutchins.htm |archivedate=2008-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deinstitutionalization]] gradually occurred in the West, with isolated psychiatric hospitals being closed down in favor of [[community mental health services]]. A [[Psychiatric survivors movement|consumer/survivor movement]] gained momentum. Other kinds of psychiatric medication gradually came into use, such as "psychic energizers" (later [[antidepressants]]) and [[lithium pharmacology|lithium]]. [[Benzodiazepines]] gained widespread use in the 1970s for anxiety and depression, until dependency problems curtailed their popularity.

Advances in [[neuroscience]], genetics and psychology led to new research agendas. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] and other psychotherapies developed. The DSM and then ICD adopted new criteria-based classifications, and the number of "official" diagnoses saw a large expansion. Through the 1990s, new [[SSRI]]-type antidepressants became some of the most widely prescribed drugs in the world, as later did [[antipsychotics]]. Also during the 1990s, a [[recovery approach]] developed.

==Society and culture==
[[File:Self.svg|right|frameless|upright=0.9]]
Different societies or [[cultures]], even different individuals in a [[subculture]], can disagree as to what constitutes optimal versus pathological biological and psychological functioning. Research has demonstrated that cultures vary in the relative importance placed on, for example, happiness, autonomy, or social relationships for pleasure. Likewise, the fact that a behavior pattern is valued, accepted, encouraged, or even statistically normative in a culture does not necessarily mean that it is conducive to optimal psychological functioning.

People in all cultures find some behaviors bizarre or even incomprehensible. But just what they feel is bizarre or incomprehensible is ambiguous and subjective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1021164602485 |year=2002 |last1=Heinimaa |first1=Markus |journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=291–5 |title=Incomprehensibility: The role of the concept in DSM-IV definition of schizophrenic delusions}}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences in determination can become highly contentious. The process by which conditions and difficulties come to be defined and treated as medical conditions and problems, and thus come under the authority of doctors and other health professionals, is known as [[medicalization]] or pathologization.

=== Religion ===
{{See also|Psychology of religion}}
[[Religious]], [[spirituality|spiritual]], or [[transpersonal]] experiences and beliefs meet many criteria of delusional or psychotic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00131746-200105000-00004 |title=Faith or Delusion?

Controversy has often surrounded psychiatry, and the term [[anti-psychiatry]] was coined by psychiatrist [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]] in 1967. The anti-psychiatry message is that [[psychiatric treatment]]s are ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients, and psychiatry's history involves what may now be seen as dangerous treatments.&lt;ref name=burns111/&gt; [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] was one of these, which was used widely between the 1930s and 1960s. [[Lobotomy]] was another practice that was ultimately seen as too invasive and brutal. [[Diazepam]] and other [[sedatives]] were sometimes over-prescribed, which led to an epidemic of dependence. There was also concern about the large increase in prescribing psychiatric drugs for children. Some charismatic psychiatrists came to personify the movement against psychiatry. The most influential of these was [[R.D. Laing]] who wrote a series of best-selling books, including ''[[The Divided Self]]''. Thomas Szasz wrote ''[[The Myth of Mental Illness]]''.

Alternatively, a movement for [[global mental health]] has emerged, defined as 'the area of study, research and practice that places a priority on improving mental health and achieving equity in mental health for all people worldwide'.&lt;ref name=Patel&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.2010.616 |title=Global Mental Health: A New Global Health Field Comes of Age |year=2010 |last1=Patel |first1=Vikram |journal=JAMA |volume=303 |issue=19 |pages=1976–7 |pmid=20483977 |last2=Prince |first2=M |pmc=3432444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural bias===
Current diagnostic guidelines, namely the DSM and to some extent the ICD, have been criticized as having a fundamentally Euro-American outlook. Opponents argue that even when diagnostic criteria are used across different cultures, it does not mean that the underlying constructs have validity within those cultures, as even reliable application can prove only consistency, not legitimacy.&lt;ref name=Widiger2000&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.51.1.377 |title=Adult Psychopathology: Issues and Controversies |year=2000 |last1=Widiger |first1=T. A. |last2=Sankis |first2=L. M. |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=51 |pages=377–404 |pmid=10751976 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocating a more culturally sensitive approach, critics such as [[Carl Bell (physician)|Carl Bell]] and Marcello Maviglia contend that the cultural and [[ethnic]] diversity of individuals is often discounted by researchers and service providers.&lt;ref name=wash-post&gt;{{cite news |first=Shankar |last=Vedantam |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/25/AR2005062500982.html |title=Psychiatry's Missing Diagnosis: Patients' Diversity Is Often Discounted |work=The Washington Post |date=June 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cross-cultural psychiatry|Cross-cultural psychiatrist]] [[Arthur Kleinman]] contends that the Western bias is ironically illustrated in the introduction of cultural factors to the [[DSM-IV]]. Disorders or concepts from non-Western or non-mainstream cultures are described as "culture-bound", whereas standard psychiatric diagnoses are given no cultural qualification whatsoever, revealing to Kleinman an underlying assumption that Western cultural phenomena are universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/10673229709030563 |title=Triumph or Pyrrhic Victory? The Inclusion of Culture in DSM-IV |year=1997 |last1=Kleinman |first1=Arthur |journal=Harvard Review of Psychiatry |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=343–4 |pmid=9385013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kleinman's negative view towards the [[culture-bound syndrome]] is largely shared by other cross-cultural critics. Common responses included both disappointment over the large number of documented non-Western mental disorders still left out and frustration that even those included are often misinterpreted or misrepresented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bhugra |first1=D. |last2=Munro |first2=A. |year=1997 |title=Troublesome Disguises: Underdiagnosed Psychiatric Syndromes |publisher=Blackwell Science}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mainstream psychiatrists are dissatisfied with the new culture-bound diagnoses, although for partly different reasons. [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]], a lead architect of the [[DSM-III]], has argued that adding cultural formulations was an attempt to appease cultural critics, and has stated that they lack any scientific rationale or support. Spitzer also posits that the new culture-bound diagnoses are rarely used, maintaining that the standard diagnoses apply regardless of the culture involved. In general, mainstream psychiatric opinion remains that if a diagnostic category is valid, cross-cultural factors are either irrelevant or are significant only to specific symptom presentations.&lt;ref name="Widiger2000" /&gt;

Clinical conceptions of mental illness also overlap with [[value (personal and cultural)|personal and cultural values]] in the domain of [[morality]], so much so that it is sometimes argued that separating the two is impossible without fundamentally redefining the essence of being a particular [[person]] in a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1521/pedi.2006.20.2.184 |title=The Role of Moral Judgment in Personality Disorder Diagnosis |year=2006 |last1=Clark |first1=Lee Anna |journal=Journal of Personality Disorders |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=184–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In clinical psychiatry, persistent distress and disability indicate an internal disorder requiring treatment; but in another context, that same distress and disability can be seen as an indicator of emotional struggle and the need to address social and structural problems.&lt;ref name="Karasz05"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.08.011 |title=Cultural differences in conceptual models of depression |year=2005 |last1=Karasz |first1=Alison |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=60 |issue=7 |pages=1625–35 |pmid=15652693}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5172/hesr.13.1.54 |title='There are orphans in Africa still looking for my hands': African women refugees and the sources of emotional distress |year=2004 |last1=Tilbury |first1=Farida |last2=Rapley |first2=Mark |journal=Health Sociology Review |volume=13 |pages=54–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dichotomy has led some academics and clinicians to advocate a [[postmodernist]] conceptualization of mental distress and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7288.724 |title=Postpsychiatry: A new direction for mental health |year=2001 |last1=Bracken |first1=P. |journal=BMJ |volume=322 |issue=7288 |pages=724–7 |pmid=11264215 |last2=Thomas |first2=P |pmc=1119907}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1009018429802 |year=2000 |last1=Lewis |first1=Bradley |journal=Journal of Medical Humanities |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=71–84 |title=Psychiatry and Postmodern Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such approaches, along with cross-cultural and "[[heresy|heretical]]" psychologies centered on alternative cultural and [[ethnic]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race-based]] identities and experiences, stand in contrast to the mainstream psychiatric community's alleged avoidance of any explicit involvement with either morality or culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10912-005-7698-x |title=The Heresy of African-Centered Psychology |year=2005 |last1=Kwate |first1=Naa Oyo A. |journal=Journal of Medical Humanities |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=215–35 |pmid=16333686}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries there are attempts to challenge perceived prejudice against [[minority groups]], including alleged [[institutional racism]] within psychiatric services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/pb.bp.107.017137 |title=Institutional racism in mental health services does not imply racism in individual psychiatrists: Commentary on...

===Laws and policies===
{{See also|Mental health law}}
Three quarters of countries around the world have mental health legislation. Compulsory admission to mental health facilities (also known as [[involuntary commitment]]) is a controversial topic. It can impinge on personal liberty and the right to choose, and carry the risk of abuse for political, social and other reasons; yet it can potentially prevent harm to self and others, and assist some people in attaining their right to healthcare when they may be unable to decide in their own interests.&lt;ref name="WHORIGHTS"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=World Health Organization |year=2005 |url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/policy/who_rb_mnh_hr_leg_FINAL_11_07_05.pdf |title=WHO Resource Book on Mental Health: Human rights and legislation |isbn=92-4-156282-X |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025235045/http://www.who.int/mental_health/policy/who_rb_mnh_hr_leg_FINAL_11_07_05.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-25 |df= }}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[human rights]] oriented mental health laws require proof of the presence of a mental disorder as defined by internationally accepted standards, but the type and severity of disorder that counts can vary in different jurisdictions. The two most often utilized grounds for involuntary admission are said to be serious likelihood of immediate or imminent danger to self or others, and the need for treatment. Applications for someone to be involuntarily admitted usually come from a mental health practitioner, a family member, a close relative, or a guardian. Human-rights-oriented laws usually stipulate that independent medical practitioners or other accredited mental health practitioners must examine the patient separately and that there should be regular, time-bound review by an independent review body.&lt;ref name="WHORIGHTS"/&gt; The individual should also have personal access to independent [[advocacy]].

In order for [[involuntary treatment]] to be administered (by force if necessary), it should be shown that an individual lacks the mental capacity for [[informed consent]] (i.e. to understand treatment information and its implications, and therefore be able to make an informed choice to either accept or refuse). Legal challenges in some areas have resulted in [[supreme court]] decisions that a person does ''not'' have to agree with a psychiatrist's characterization of the issues as constituting an "illness", nor agree with a psychiatrist's conviction in medication, but only recognize the issues and the information about treatment options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=17696026 |date=June 2007 |last1=Sklar |first1=Ronald |title=Starson v. Swayze: The Supreme Court Speaks Out (Not all That Clearly) on the Question of 'Capacity' |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=390–6 |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |url=http://publications.cpa-apc.org/media.php?mid=411 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821021858/http://publications.cpa-apc.org/media.php?mid=411 |archivedate=2014-08-21 |df= |doi=10.1177/070674370705200609 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy consent (also known as [[Surrogate decision-maker|surrogate or substituted decision-making]]) may be transferred to a personal representative, a family member or a legally appointed guardian. Moreover, patients may be able to make, when they are considered well, an [[advance directive]] stipulating how they wish to be treated should they be deemed to lack mental capacity in future.&lt;ref name="WHORIGHTS"/&gt; The right to [[Decision aids|supported decision-making]], where a person is helped to understand and choose treatment options before they can be declared to lack capacity, may also be included in legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Manitoba Family Services and Housing. The Vulnerable Persons Living with a Mental Disability Act, 1996{{psc|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There should at the very least be [[shared decision-making]] as far as possible. Involuntary treatment laws are increasingly extended to those living in the community, for example [[outpatient commitment]] laws (known by different names) are used in New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom and most of the United States.

The World Health Organization reports that in many instances national mental health legislation takes away the rights of persons with mental disorders rather than protecting rights, and is often outdated.&lt;ref name="WHORIGHTS"/&gt; In 1991, the [[United Nations]] adopted the ''Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and the Improvement of Mental Health Care'', which established minimum human rights standards of practice in the mental health field. In 2006, the UN formally agreed the ''[[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]'' to protect and enhance the rights and opportunities of disabled people, including those with psychosocial disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/ ENABLE website] UN section on disability&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[insanity]], sometimes used [[colloquialism|colloquially]] as a [[synonym]] for mental illness, is often used technically as a legal term. The [[insanity defense]] may be used in a legal trial (known as the [[Mental Disorder (Insanity) Defense|mental disorder defence]] in some countries).

====Stigma====
The [[social stigma]] associated with mental disorders is a widespread problem.

Recent depictions in media have included leading characters successfully living with and managing a mental illness, including in bipolar disorder in ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'' (2011) and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013).{{Original research inline|date=May 2013}}

====Violence====
Despite public or media opinion, national studies have indicated that severe mental illness does not independently predict future violent behavior, on average, and is not a leading cause of violence in society. There is a statistical association with various factors that do relate to violence (in anyone), such as substance abuse and various personal, social and economic factors.&lt;ref name="pmid19188537"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2008.537 |title=The Intricate Link Between Violence and Mental Disorder: Results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions |year=2009 |last1=Elbogen |first1=Eric B. |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=152–61 |pmid=19188537 |last2=Johnson |first2=SC}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 review found that in the United States, about 4% of violence is attributable to people diagnosed with mental illness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Metzl|first1=Jonathan M.|last2=MacLeish|first2=Kenneth T.|title=Mental Illness, Mass Shootings, and the Politics of American Firearms|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=February 2015|volume=105|issue=2|pages=240–249|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2014.302242|pmid=25496006|pmc=4318286}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2014 study found that 7.5% of crimes committed by mentally ill people were directly related to the symptoms of their mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Jillian K.|last2=Skeem|first2=Jennifer|last3=Kennealy|first3=Patrick|last4=Bray|first4=Beth|last5=Zvonkovic|first5=Andrea|title=How often and how consistently do symptoms directly precede criminal behavior among offenders with mental illness?|journal=Law and Human Behavior|date=2014|volume=38|issue=5|pages=439–449|doi=10.1037/lhb0000075}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of people with serious mental illness are never violent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swanson|first1=JW|last2=McGinty|first2=EE|last3=Fazel|first3=S|last4=Mays|first4=VM|title=Mental illness and reduction of gun violence and suicide: bringing epidemiologic research to policy.|journal=Annals of Epidemiology|date=May 2015|volume=25|issue=5|pages=366–76|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2014.03.004|pmid=24861430|pmc=4211925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, findings consistently indicate that it is many times more likely that people diagnosed with a serious mental illness living in the community will be the victims rather than the perpetrators of violence.&lt;ref name="Stuart03"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.52.10.1358 |title=Risks for Individuals with Schizophrenia Who Are Living in the Community |year=2001 |last1=Brekke |first1=John S. |journal=Psychiatric Services |volume=52 |issue=10 |pages=1358–66 |pmid=11585953 |last2=Prindle |first2=C |last3=Bae |first3=SW |last4=Long |first4=JD}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of individuals diagnosed with "severe mental illness" living in a US inner-city area, a quarter were found to have been [[Victimology|victims]] of at least one violent crime over the course of a year, a proportion eleven times higher than the inner-city average, and higher in every category of crime including violent assaults and theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.62.8.911 |title=Crime Victimization in Adults with Severe Mental Illness: Comparison with the National Crime Victimization Survey |year=2005 |last1=Teplin |first1=Linda A. |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=62 |issue=8 |pages=911–21 |pmid=16061769 |last2=McClelland |first2=GM |last3=Abram |first3=KM |last4=Weiner |first4=DA |pmc=1389236}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with a diagnosis may find it more difficult to secure prosecutions, however, due in part to prejudice and being seen as less credible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/009385480102800601 |title=Crime Victims with Developmental Disabilities: A Review Essay |year=2001 |last1=Petersilia |first1=J.

However, there are some specific diagnoses, such as childhood conduct disorder or adult [[antisocial personality disorder]] or [[psychopathy]], which are defined by, or are inherently associated with, conduct problems and violence. There are conflicting findings about the extent to which certain specific symptoms, notably some kinds of psychosis (hallucinations or delusions) that can occur in disorders such as schizophrenia, delusional disorder or mood disorder, are linked to an increased risk of serious violence on average. The [[Mediation (statistics)|mediating]] factors of violent acts, however, are most consistently found to be mainly socio-demographic and socio-economic factors such as being young, male, of lower [[socioeconomic status]] and, in particular, substance abuse (including [[alcoholism]]) to which some people may be particularly vulnerable.&lt;ref name="Rogers&amp;Pilgram05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuart03"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Stuart H |title=Violence and mental illness: an overview |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=121–124 |date=June 2003|pmid=16946914 |pmc=1525086}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.55.5.393 |title=Violence by People Discharged from Acute Psychiatric Inpatient Facilities and by Others in the Same Neighborhoods |year=1998 |last1=Steadman |first1=H.

==Mental health==
{{Main|Mental health}}
The recognition and understanding of [[mental health]] conditions have changed over time and across cultures and there are still variations in definition, assessment and [[classification of mental disorders|classification]], although standard guideline criteria are widely used. In many cases, there appears to be a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] between mental health and mental illness, making diagnosis complex.&lt;ref name=SurgeonGeneral1999chap2/&gt;{{rp|39}} According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), over a third of people in most countries report problems at some time in their life which meet criteria for diagnosis of one or more of the common types of mental disorder.&lt;ref name="WHOICPE"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10885160 |year=2000 |title=Cross-national comparisons of the prevalences and correlates of mental disorders.

==Other animals==
{{main|Animal psychopathology}}
[[Psychopathology]] in non-human [[primates]] has been studied since the mid-20th century. Over 20 behavioral patterns in captive chimpanzees have been documented as (statistically) abnormal for frequency, severity or oddness—some of which have also been observed in the wild. Captive [[great apes]] show gross behavioral abnormalities such as [[stereotypy]] of movements, [[self-mutilation]], disturbed emotional reactions (mainly fear or aggression) towards companions, lack of species-typical communications, and generalized [[learned helplessness]]. In some cases such behaviors are hypothesized to be equivalent to symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders in humans such as depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. Concepts of antisocial, borderline and schizoid personality disorders have also been applied to non-human great apes.&lt;ref name="Brune2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2006.09.002 |title=Psychopathology in great apes: Concepts, treatment options and possible homologies to human psychiatric disorders |year=2006 |last1=Brune |first1=M |last2=Brunecohrs |first2=U |last3=McGrew |first3=W |last4=Preuschoft |first4=S |journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=1246–59 |pmid=17141312}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0019855 |title=Signs of Mood and Anxiety Disorders in Chimpanzees |year=2011 |editor1-last=Callaerts |editor1-first=Patrick |last1=Ferdowsian |first1=Hope R. |last2=Durham |first2=Debra L. |last3=Kimwele |first3=Charles |last4=Kranendonk |first4=Godelieve |last5=Otali |first5=Emily |last6=Akugizibwe |first6=Timothy |last7=Mulcahy |first7=J.

The risk of [[anthropomorphism]] is often raised with regard to such comparisons, and assessment of non-human animals cannot incorporate evidence from linguistic communication. However, available evidence may range from nonverbal behaviors—including physiological responses and homologous facial displays and acoustic utterances—to neurochemical studies. It is pointed out that human psychiatric classification is often based on statistical description and judgment of behaviors (especially when speech or language is impaired) and that the use of verbal self-report is itself problematic and unreliable.&lt;ref name="Brune2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fabrega2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2006.09.004 |title=Making sense of behavioral irregularities of great apes |year=2006 |last1=Fabregajr |first1=H |journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=1260–73; discussion 1274–7 |pmid=17079015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychopathology has generally been traced, at least in captivity, to adverse rearing conditions such as early separation of infants from mothers; early sensory deprivation; and extended periods of social isolation. Studies have also indicated individual variation in temperament, such as sociability or impulsiveness. Particular causes of problems in captivity have included integration of strangers into existing groups and a lack of individual space, in which context some pathological behaviors have also been seen as coping mechanisms. Remedial interventions have included careful individually tailored re-socialization programs, [[behavior therapy]], environment enrichment, and on rare occasions psychiatric drugs. Socialization has been found to work 90% of the time in disturbed chimpanzees, although restoration of functional sexuality and care-giving is often not achieved.&lt;ref name="Brune2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld1999"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0735-7036.113.4.365 |title=A preliminary investigation of the construct of psychopathic personality (psychopathy) in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) |year=1999 |last1=Lilienfeld |first1=Scott O. |last2=Gershon |first2=Jonathan |last3=Duke |first3=Marshall |last4=Marino |first4=Lori |last5=De Waal |first5=Frans B. M. |journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology |volume=113 |issue=4 |pages=365–75 |pmid=10608560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laboratory researchers sometimes try to develop [[animal models]] of human mental disorders, including by inducing or treating symptoms in animals through genetic, neurological, chemical or behavioral manipulation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moran M |title=Animals Can Model Psychiatric Symptoms |journal=Psychiatric News |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=20–30 |date=June 20, 2003 |url=http://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/newsarticle.aspx?articleid=106357 |doi=10.1176/pn.38.12.0020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0954579401003029 |title=Early adverse experience as a developmental risk factor for later psychopathology: Evidence from rodent and primate models |year=2001 |last1=Sánchez |first1=M.

==Demographics==
According to David Bradley (2004),&lt;ref name="Bradley2004"&gt;Bradley, David. 2004. ''[https://www.academia.edu/5737342/Endangered_Central_Ngwi_Languages_of_Central_Yunnan Endangered Central Ngwi Languages of Central Yunnan]''. Keynote Presentation, 37th International Conference on Sino-Tibetan Languages and Linguistics, Lund University, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt; Naluo (Naruo, Laluo, Naru, Shuitian 水田, Shui Yi 水彝 (used in Yunnan)) is spoken by about 15,000 people mostly in eastern [[Yongsheng County]] and southern [[Huaping County]], Yunnan, as well as in Pingjiang 平江 and Futian 福田镇 townships, western [[Panzhihua]] City, Sichuan. Naluo is moribund or extinct in Sichuan, and endangered in Yunnan.

*'''Luoluo 倮倮''' subgroup (autonym: '''Xiqima 洗期麻'''; also called '''Li 傈/黎''')

Other varieties are:&lt;ref&gt;https://asiaharvest.org/people-group-profiles/#china&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Naru 纳儒''' of southern and central [[Yongsheng County]] (pop. 7,000) and southern [[Huaping County]] (pop. 4,500)
*'''Naruo 纳若''' (Zhili) of [[Yongsheng County]] and [[Huaping County]], spoken by about 12,000 people. It may be the same as Xiaoliangshan Nosu.

'''Lopi (Shuitian 水田)'''&lt;ref&gt;http://asiaharvest.org/wp-content/themes/asia/docs/people-groups/China/chinaPeoples/L/Lopi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is an essentially extinct language, although there are more than 15,000 people belonging to the ethnic group in [[Panzhihua]], Sichuan (in Futian 福田 and Pingjiang 平江 Townships) and in northern Yunnan.

'''''Nongoloza's Children: Western Cape Prison Gangs During and After Apartheid''''', a book written as a monograph about the gangs from prisons of the [[Western Cape]] during and after [[Racial integration|racial isolation]], was written for the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation by [[Jonny Steinberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csvr.org.za/docs/gangs/nongolozaschildren.pdf|title=Nongoloza's Children: Western Cape prison gangs during and after apartheid|author=Jonny Steinberg|website=Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation| page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Center for Security Studies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/services/digital-library/publications/publication.html/99648 |title=Nongoloza's Children  |date=July 2004 |website=Center for Security Studies, Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich |accessdate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It explores the prevalence of gangs in society and in prisons and offers recommendations for solving post-[[apartheid]] [[gang violence]].&lt;ref name="Center for Security Studies" /&gt;

==Overview==
The author writes that he spent nine months of research at PollsMoor Prison Admission Center. There he interviewed the prisoners, most of whom were awaiting trial. For an 18-month period he interviewed about 30 veterans members of gangs. During the 1980s and 1990s all of them served their sentences in prisons throughout the Western Cape.&lt;ref name="Make this up"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/17533171.2011.642586 | volume=13 | title="In a Country where You couldn't Make this Shit up"?: Literary Non‐Fiction in South Africa | year=2012 | journal=Safundi | pages=5–28 | author=Twidle Hedley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TandF"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/10246029.2005.9627345 | volume=14 | title=BOOK REVIEWS | journal=African Security Review | pages=135–143 | year=2005 | author=Altbeker Antony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Steinberg, [[The Numbers Gang]]s take their inspiration from the historical figure Nongoloza Mathebula, born Mzuzephi Mathebula, who became the founder of The Number Gangs in South Africa. An early Johannesburg bandit, he built a quasi-military band of outlaws, welding his small army together with a simple but potent ideology of banditry-as-anti-colonial-resistance.&lt;ref name="Make this up" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TandF" /&gt;

'''Orlando Winfield Wilson''' (May 15, 1900 – October 18, 1972), also known as '''O. W. Wilson''', was an American police officer, later becoming a leader in [[policing]]. Wilson served as Superintendent of Police for the [[Chicago Police Department]] under the [[Richard J. Daley]] administration from 1960 until retiring in 1967. [[chief of police]] in [[Fullerton, California]] and [[Wichita, Kansas]], and authored several books on policing.
==Background==
===Early life and career===
Wilson was born on May 15, 1900, in [[Veblen, South Dakota]], and moved with his family to California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Police An Introduction |author=Lyman, Michael D. |year=2004 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-118222-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1921, Wilson enrolled in the [[University of California, Berkeley]], majoring in [[criminology]] and studying under [[August Vollmer]]. Wilson graduated in 1924, with a Bachelor of Arts degree.&lt;ref name="cdlib"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf3v19n6s0&amp;doc.view=entire_text |title=Guide to the Orlando Winfield Wilson Papers, ca. 1928–1972 |publisher=Online Archive of California |accessdate=2006-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Berkeley, he also worked as a [[police officer]] with the [[Berkeley Police Department]]; such education for a [[police officer]] was rare at the time.&lt;ref name="donnermeyer"&gt;{{cite book |title=Security and Crime Prevention |author=[[Joseph Donnermeyer|Donnermeyer, Joseph F.]], Robert L. O'Block |year=1991 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-7506-9007-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, Wilson served as a Provost Marshal with the U.S. Army and retired from the service with the rank of full colonel in the military police. Wilson remained in Europe until 1947 as an advisor to local law enforcement.
===Policing===
In 1925, Wilson became chief of police of the [[Fullerton Police Department]] for two years.&lt;ref name="cdlib"/&gt;  He then spent two years as an investigator with the Pacific Finance Corporation.&lt;ref name="nytimes-19600302"/&gt;  In 1928, at age 28, he became chief of police of the [[Wichita Police Department]], where he served until 1939.&lt;ref name="cdlib"/&gt;  In Wichita, he led reforms to reduce [[Police corruption|corruption]]. There he instituted professionalism in the department, requiring new hires to have a [[college]] education, and introduced innovations, such as the use [[police car]]s for patrol, mobile [[radio]]s, and use of a mobile [[crime laboratory]].&lt;ref name="donnermeyer"/&gt;  He believed that use of [[two-way radio]] allowed for better supervision of patrol officers, and therefore more efficient policing.&lt;ref name="nytimes-19600302"/&gt; When the war ended, he remained in Europe until 1947, leading reorganization of police forces in Europe.&lt;ref name="russell"&gt;{{cite book |author=Russell, Gregory D., Terry Gingerich, Rebecca Paynich, James A Conser |title=Law Enforcement in the United States |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7637-8352-5}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
===Chicago===
In 1960, [[Chicago]] mayor [[Richard J. Daley]], in the wake of a major police [[scandal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crime and Punishment in American History |author=Friedman, Lawrence M. |year=1993 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-01461-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; established a commission headed by Wilson to find a new police commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Police Head Resigns in Chicago After Stratton Bids Mayor Act |publisher=Associated Press/The New York Times |date=January 24, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end, Daley decided to appoint Wilson himself, as Commissioner.&lt;ref name="nytimes-1960"&gt;{{cite news |title=Chicago Chooses Criminologist to Head and Clean Up the Police |publisher=United Press International/The New York Times |date=February 22, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning on March 2, 1960,&lt;ref name="nytimes-19600302"/&gt; Wilson served the Superintendent of Police of the [[Chicago Police Department]] until 1967 when he retired. Reforms demanded at the outset by Wilson included establishment of a non-partisan police board to help govern the police force, a strict [[:wikt:merit|merit]] system for promotions within the department, an aggressive, nationwide recruiting drive for hiring new officers, and higher police salaries to attract professionally qualified officers.&lt;ref name="nytimes-1960"/&gt; For starters, Wilson moved the superintendent's office from City Hall to Police Headquarters and closed police districts and redrew their boundaries without regard to politics. Hiring standards were raised, graft curbed, and discipline tightened, with a new Police Board overseeing it. Wilson updated the communications system, adopted computers and improved record-keeping, bought new squad cars, and eliminated most foot patrols. Police boasted of quicker response times to citizen calls. Police morale, and the public image of the police, rose. Wilson also improved police relations with the black community. He recruited more African American officers, promoted black sergeants, and insisted on police restraint in racially charged conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/983.html |title=Police|publisher=Encyclopedia of Chicago |accessdate=2007-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Academia===
Wilson had also taught at [[Harvard University]] in the 1930s, working with the Harvard Bureau for Street Traffic Research.&lt;ref name="halsey"&gt;{{cite news |title=Law Enforcement Held Safety Need |author=Halsey, Maxwell |date=November 11, 1936 |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also served as director of the New England Traffic Officers' Training School, which offered intensive two-week courses to police officers on [[traffic]] safety and enforcement.&lt;ref name="halsey"/&gt; In 1939, Wilson became Professor of Police Administration at Berkeley.&lt;ref name="cmsu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmsu.edu/x74741.xml |title=O.W. Wilson |publisher=University of Central Missouri |accessdate=2006-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1950 to 1960, Wilson was the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of Berkeley's School of Criminology.&lt;ref name="cdlib"/&gt;  Wilson authored several books, including ''Police Records'', ''Police Planning'', and the highly influential work, ''Police Administration'' which was first published in 1943.&lt;ref name="russell"/&gt;  While at Berkeley, Wilson also served as a consultant, advising cities including [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], and [[Louisville, Kentucky]] on reorganization of their police agencies.&lt;ref name="nytimes-19600302"/&gt;
==Police professionalism==
By the 1950s, Wilson's ideas of police professionalism, presented in ''Police Administration'', were widely implemented in police agencies across the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Police Innovation: Contrasting Perspectives |author=Weisburd, David, Anthony A. Braga |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-83628-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These ideas remained popular until the advent of [[community policing]].&lt;ref name="chu"&gt;{{cite book |title=Law Enforcement Information Technology: A Managerial, Operational, and Practitioner Guide |author=Chu, James |year=2001 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8493-1089-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilson believed that preventive [[patrol]] and rapid response to calls would be effective, creating a sense of police omnipresence among [[criminal]]s.&lt;ref name="chu"/&gt;

==Personal and death==
Wilson, together with his wife Ruth Elinor Wilson, had one daughter.&lt;ref name="nytimes-19600302"&gt;{{cite news |title=Educator on a New Beat |publisher=The New York Times |date=March 2, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilson had another son and daughter, by a previous marriage.&lt;ref name="nytimes-19600302"/&gt; After retiring from the Chicago Police Department in 1967, Wilson lived in [[Poway, California]] until his death in 1972.&lt;ref name="cdlib"/&gt;

'''OFFLU''' is the joint '''O'''IE-'''F'''AO global network of expertise on animal in'''flu'''enzas.  OFFLU aims to reduce negative impacts of animal [[influenza virus]]es by promoting effective collaboration between [[animal health]] experts and with the human health sector.  OFFLU puts a strong emphasis on the importance of analysing and sharing information, and biological material to identify and reduce health threats early, and on sharing information about animal influenza viruses with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) to assist with the early preparation of human vaccines. Since its establishment in 2005, initially to support the global effort to control [[H5N1]] highly pathogenic avian influenza, OFFLU has become a strong and functional network. 

The technical contribution to OFFLU is provided by an open network of world leading experts. This includes animal influenza experts from the OIE and FAO Reference Laboratories and Collaborating Centres, and from other institutes with leading expertise in diagnostics, epidemiology, bioinformatics, vaccinology, and animal production.  Under the coordination and management of OFFLU, experts work together in discussion groups, called OFFLU Technical Activities, on pertinent topics and on technical projects to provide concrete outputs on relevant influenza related issues. To date, these Technical Activities have delivered guidance on diagnostic protocols, antigenic matching of vaccine strains with circulating field viruses, minimum biosafety guidelines for laboratory workers, and strategic guidance on animal influenza surveillance. 

The effectiveness and degree of collaboration between OFFLU and the human health sector (WHO) has improved significantly.  This was highlighted following the emergence of pandemic H1N1 in April 2009 when OFFLU rapidly mobilised its experts to address the human-animal interface aspects of pandemic H1N1 jointly with colleagues from the public health sector.

OFFLU continues to develop in terms of scope and geographical representation, and is looking ahead to developing a sustainable and effective mechanism for monitoring influenza viruses in animals and for communicating significant findings to all partners quickly.

==OFFLU's Objectives==
•	To share and offer technical advice, training and veterinary expertise to international organisations and Member Countries to assist in the prevention, diagnosis, surveillance and control of animal influenza. &lt;br /&gt;
•       To exchange scientific data and biological materials (including virus strains) within the network, to analyse such data, and to share such information with the wider scientific community.&lt;br /&gt;
•	To collaborate with the WHO on issues relating to the animal-human interface, including pandemic preparedness for early preparation of human vaccine. &lt;br /&gt;
•	To highlight influenza surveillance and research needs, promote their development and ensure co-ordination.

''Structure''&lt;br /&gt;
The OFFLU network is managed by a steering committee who provide strategic direction, an Executive Committee who implement the decisions of the steering committee, a secretariat, and a dedicated OFFLU scientist.  
The network itself is made up of world leading scientists from a range of fields including virology, epidemiology, bioinformatics, vaccinology, and animal production.

==Origins==
In February 2006, "OFFLU launched a campaign for openness when Dr. Ilaria Capua of Italy, chair of the network's Scientific Committee, published sequence data on H5N1 strains from Nigeria and Italy and urged 50 colleagues around the world to share their data. In March, the OFFLU Scientific Committee decided "to put new emphasis on the need for further collection, characterization, and exchange" of avian flu viruses and for expansion of sequence data, the FAO reported. At about the same time, Capua and four OFFLU colleagues wrote a letter to the journal Science promising to make H5N1 samples available for sequencing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/aug0306sharing.html CIDRAP] article ''Indonesia, FAO, OIE pledge to publish H5N1 data'' published August 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Leland Kirk''' (May 9, 1902 &amp;ndash; June 5, 1970&lt;ref name="natcyc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt;) was a [[chemist]], [[forensic science|forensic scientist]] and participant in the [[Manhattan Project]] who was specialized in [[microscopy]]. He also investigated the bedroom in which Sam Sheppard supposedly murdered his wife and provided the key [[bloodstain pattern analysis|blood spatter evidence]] that led to his [[acquittal]] in a retrial over 12 years after the murder. The highest honor one can receive in the [[criminalistics]] section of the [[American Academy of Forensic Sciences]] carries Kirk's name.&lt;ref name="chisum"&gt;

==Education==
Kirk received his [[Bachelor's degree]] in chemistry from [[Ohio State University]] and got his [[Masters degree]] in chemistry from the [[University of Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref name="chisum"/&gt; He went on to receive a [[Ph.D.]] in [[biochemistry]] from [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]].&lt;ref name='sheppard-testimony'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/sheppard/kirktestimony.html |title=Selected Testimony of Doctor Paul Kirk in Sam Sheppard's 1966 Murder Trial |accessdate=2007-03-18 |publisher=[[University of Missouri-Kansas City]] School of Law |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416191653/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/sheppard/kirktestimony.html |archive-date=2007-04-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}; taken from: Paul Holmes,  Retrial: Murder and Dr. Sam Sheppard (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1929 Kirk became professor of biochemistry at UC Berkeley. According to Kirk, he first became interested in forensic science in his early days as a teacher after a student asked if it could be determined if a dog had died of [[poison]]ing. Forensic science permanently piqued his interest when authorities asked him to do a microscopic examination of a rape victim's clothing. He found fibers from the attacker's shirt and this evidence resulted in a conviction. In 1937, Kirk became leader of UC Berkeley's [[criminology]] program. Due to his extensive experience in microscopy, Kirk was asked to join the [[Manhattan Project]] where he worked on the process to isolate [[Nuclear fission|fissionable]] [[plutonium]] from 1942 to 1945. When he returned to Berkeley, he created a major in technical criminology and when [[August Vollmer]] established the UC School of Criminology, Kirk was appointed to chair the criminalistics department.&lt;ref name="chisum"/&gt;

Kirk was also an avid supporter of [[Locard's exchange principle]]. As a result of his detailed descriptions of the principle, Kirk's words have repeatedly been mistaken for those of [[Edmond Locard]] himself. Unlike others before him, Kirk understood the limits of the principle and argued for caution in the interpretation of exchange evidence.&lt;ref name="chisum"/&gt;

Kirk is best known for his work in the [[Sam Sheppard]] case. On January 22, 1955 &amp;ndash; one month after Sheppard's conviction &amp;ndash; Kirk visited the scene of the crime after which he wrote an extensive report primarily based on [[bloodstain pattern analysis]]. A motion for a retrial had been denied in 1955, but this decision was overturned in 1964 and in 1966, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] upheld the decision for a retrial. Later that same year, Kirk testified at the retrial, which led to Sheppard's acquittal. Kirk's testimony embarrassed [[Samuel Gerber]], a senior member of the [[American Academy of Forensic Sciences]] (AAFS) who was working for the prosecution and believed in Sheppard's guilt. Kirk was denied AAFS membership, but he still left his mark on the organization. The highest honor awarded in the [[criminalistics]] section of the AAFS is the Paul L. Kirk Award.&lt;ref name="chisum"/&gt;

Dr. Kirk's photographs, analysis, and testimony from the Sam Sheppard case can be seen at http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/kirk_photos/index.2.html.

==Bibliography==
Not only did Kirk publish around 250 articles in multiple fields of research ranging from biochemistry to criminalistics; he also contributed articles to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] and he was the author of the following books.&lt;ref name="natcyc"/&gt;
*''Quantitative Ultramicroanalysis'' (1950)

Muslim polygamy, in practice and law, differs greatly throughout the Islamic world. In some Muslim countries, polygamy is relatively common, while in most others, it is often rare or non-existent. Polygamy is most widely practiced by Muslims in West Africa (where it is also widely practiced by non-Muslims), as well as in certain traditionalist Arabian states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

As with [[polygyny in Islam]] in general, men are allowed up to four wives, and women are not permitted multiple husbands.&lt;ref name=Publishing2006/&gt;

''' Preparation ''' is a management principle whereby people get ready for a final product or for a successful experience. Preparation means "a substance especially prepared".&lt;ref name=OnlineEty&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=preparation |title=preparation |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2014|website=Online Etymology Dictionary  |publisher=Douglas Harper |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparation is a proceeding or readiness for a future event as a goal and an acceptable accomplished final outcome.&lt;ref name=OnlineDictionary/&gt; It is to make something (''e.g.'', child, food, procedures, machines) acceptable before you give it to others.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=6}}

== Etymology ==

The word "preparation" comes from late Middle English (1350–1400): via Old French from Latin praeparationem ''praeparatio(n-)'' "a making ready". It is from a past participle stem of ''praeparāre'' meaning to prepare; from prae "before" + parare "make ready".{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=6}} The word "prepare" means to put in proper readiness beforehand and has a relationship to the word "parent."&lt;ref name=OnlineDictionary&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Preparation+?s=t |title=preparation |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website= |publisher=Dictionary.Com |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==

The concept of preparation is where one prepares (makes ready) for something. An example of a preparatory process is when a high school student prepares for a [[higher education]] by taking the appropriate [[college prep]] courses. High school students can also take certain courses that will enable them to be prepared for the work force upon graduation.{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|pp=6–11}} Certain school courses teach preparation for choosing a career.{{sfn|Baker|2005|pp=299–333}}
The discipline of old-school step-by-step meticulous preparing as getting ready for something leads to ultimate accomplishment.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=1}}

== Checklist ==
Preparation is preparing and getting ready materials and equipment before an event takes place.{{sfn| Cialdini|2010|p=71}}{{sfn| Klein|2004|pp=34–37}}{{sfn| Kyriacou|1998|p=16}} Many times a [[checklist]] is the result of someone not doing the proper beforehand steps needed before a major event is to occur (''i.e.'', [[Takeoff|airplane takeoff]], [[medical procedure]]) and later disastrous results happen because of this lack of preparedness.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=4}} Meetings should involve people being first notified so they can do preparation ahead of the meeting time.{{sfn|Gates|2009|p=20}}

Preparation involves a fact-finding mission in getting a qualified person for a position in a company. This includes not only the characteristics of the potential new employee but the parameters of a particular company including its policies and dynamics.{{sfn|Khurana|2011|pp=134–5}} The person as a business partner should know how to solve problems, create opportunities, and use the company’s strengths in a strategic way.{{sfn| Gilley|2007|pp=186–9}} Organizations involved in teaching must prepare new knowledge to teach individuals to grow. This preparation of new information and teaching self-motivation then involves forming knowledge acquisition plans.{{sfn|Gilley|2000|pp=130–9}} [[On the job training]] engages people in activities that are practical in preparation for an improvement in their career skills. To get an individual self-motivated one should be taught how certain information and preparation of specific skills will benefit them personally. A method of preparation is when a manager will explain what is expected as an end result and some possible ways to accomplish that and get the employee engaged in real life situations.{{sfn|Buckingham|2005|pp=121–2}}

== System ==
[[File:WikiPreparation.jpg|thumb|Wikipedian preparing for a new article]]
Having a well defined ''preparation system'' will increase one's chances of becoming a strong competitor.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=36}} Preparation is to harness your passion of something with a system of developing steps to accomplish a good outcome.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=19}} 
For example, Wikipedians do certain steps in preparing to create a new article.{{sfn|Ayers|Matthews|Yates|2008|p=162}} Preparation is used in business transactions and management.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=4}} Professionals in all fields that achieve their goals are masters at preparing and putting their ducks in a row.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=10}}

Many times an important part of preparation is the concept that [[time is of the essence]] and applies especially to [[contract law]].{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=5}} Preparation allows time needed to do the right steps sequentially in the correct order, instead of panicking and doing quick steps haphazardly with no thought has to what should come first and what should come next.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=5}} Preparation time gives better results as a conclusion where one can achieve what's desired.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=5}} Avoiding proper preparation through scheming short-cuts in the long run doesn't pay and will give unwanted results.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|pp=22–25}}

== Beforehand planning ==
The concept of "preparation" has a [[Venn diagram|Venn relationship]] with the concept of "planning"; the two concepts are separate but closely intertwined.{{sfn|Harnack|Story |1998|pp=995–1000}} In scholarly use, the concept of "planning" is often associated with long-tailed, open-ended processes of chronological foresight, while the concept of "preparation" is more closely tied to immediate steps taken to achieve a tangible, closed-ended goal.{{sfn|Harnack|Story |1998|pp=995–1000}} For example, a dietician may counsel her clients on the elements of meal "planning," and after internalizing this training the client may utilize his meal-planning skills in the immediate task of preparing a meal.{{sfn|Harnack|Story |1998|pp=995–1000}} In business use, "planning" is a management principle to set up details to achieve a goal,&lt;ref name=Bplanning&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/planning.html |title=planning |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=BusinessDictionary.com |publisher= WebFinance, Inc.|accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the concept of "preparation" is tied to contemplation of a future event by making something ready now.&lt;ref name=Bpreparation&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/preparation.html |title=preparation |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=BusinessDictionary.com |publisher= WebFinance, Inc.|accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example here would be [[merchandising]] where the preparation is the buying of the merchandise and getting it ready in the storage area and the planning is the goal of getting the merchandise shelved and sold to the customer to make a profit.&lt;ref name=merchandising&gt;{{cite web |url= http://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/differences-between-merchandising-stocking-12561.html |title=The Differences Between Merchandising &amp; Stocking |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=azcentral |publisher=Gannett Company |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[salesmanship]] use, "planning" is the principle to set up a strategy (''i.e.'', techniques) to [[Closing (sales)|close the sale]], while the concept of "preparation" is tied to contemplation of the completion of the sale and [[Guided selling|making ready now]] the assumption that it will happen.{{sfn|Bettger|2009|pp=40–55}} An example here is the preparation to ask questions to find out the customer's needs so that [[Solution selling|the plan to close the sale]] will happen.{{sfn|Bettger|2009|pp=40–55}}

[[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s viewpoint on preparation was that the secret of success in life is when a person is ready for his once in a lifetime opportunity.{{sfn|Maxwell|1998|p=29}} [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s viewpoint was that politics is a profession for which no preparation is necessary.{{sfn|Lederer|2007|p=32}} GM’s [[Alfred Sloan]] believes that with the preparation of sound facts that sound policies can be put into place.{{sfn|Gates|2009|p=20}} [[Sun Tzu]]'s philosophy on war was ''he will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.''&lt;ref name=suntzusaid&gt;{{cite web |url= http://suntzusaid.com/book/3 |title=Attack by Stratagem  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=Sun Tzu's Art of War |publisher=John Watson, LLC |accessdate=2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protean word ''qawm'' is of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin, and is used in Afghanistan to refer to any form of solidarity. [[Afghan|Afghans]] identify themselves by qawm, rather than by tribe or nationality. Qawm identity has added to the challenge of creating a national identity in Afghanistan. A qawm is typically governed by a [[jirga]] or [[shura]] (a council or assembly of elder males).

Many [[social sciences|social scientists]] support the correlation.&lt;ref name="anderson2003"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1111/j.1529-1006.2003.pspi_1433.x| pmid=26151870| title=The influence of media violence on youth| journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest| volume=4| issue=3| pages=81–110| year=2003| last1=Anderson| first1=Craig A.| last2=Berkowitz| first2=Leonard| last3=Donnerstein| first3=Edward| last4=Huesmann| first4=L.

Complaints about the possible deleterious effects of mass media appear throughout history, even [[Plato]] was concerned about the effects of plays on youth.&lt;ref name=weaver2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weaver|first=Erin|title=Based on a True Story:  The Use of Truth on the Didactic Stage|journal=Inquiry@Queen's|year=2007|issue=1|pages=1–5|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1974/1062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various media/genres, including [[dime novel]]s, [[comic book]]s, [[jazz]], [[rock and roll]], [[role playing game|role playing]]/[[computer game]]s, television, films, internet (by computer or cell phone) and many others have attracted speculation that consumers of such media may become more aggressive, rebellious or immoral. This has led some scholars to conclude statements made by some researchers merely fit into a cycle of media-based moral panics (e.g. Gauntlett, 1995; Trend, 2007; Kutner &amp; Olson, 2008). The advent of [[television]] prompted research into the effects of this new medium in the 1960s.  Much of this research has been guided by [[social learning theory]] developed by [[Albert Bandura]].  Social learning theory suggests that one way in which human beings [[imitation|learn]] is by the process of modeling.

==Media effects theories==

===Social learning theory===
Social learning theory originated with [[Albert Bandura|Bandura's]] which suggests that children may learn aggression from viewing others.&lt;ref name="Sparks, G.G. 2008 pp. 269"&gt;Sparks, G.G., Sparks, E. A &amp; Sparks, C.W. (2008) Media Violence. In J. Bryant (      
Ed),''Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research''(3rd ed., pp. 269–286)&lt;/ref&gt;  Modeling of behavior was observed in Bandura's [[Bobo Doll experiment]]s.  Bandura presented children with an Aggressive Model: The model played with 'harmless' tinker toys for a minute or so but then progressed onto the Bobo doll, the model lay the Bobo doll down and was violent towards it; punched its nose, hit it with a mallet, tossed it in the air, and kicked it. In addition, verbal comments were made in relation. They then put the children in a room with a Bobo doll to see if he/she would imitate the behavior previously seen on the video.

The findings of this experiment suggest that children tended to model the behavior they witnessed in the video.  This has been often taken to imply that children may imitate aggressive behaviors witnessed in media.  However, Bandura's experiments have been criticized (e.g. Gauntlett, 1995) on several grounds.  First, it is difficult to generalize from aggression toward a bo-bo doll (which is intended to be hit) to person-on-person violence.  Secondly, it may be possible that the children were motivated simply to please the experimenter rather than to be aggressive.  In other words, the children may have viewed the videos as instructions, rather than incentives to feel more aggressive.  Third, in a latter study (1965) Bandura included a condition in which the adult model was punished for hitting the bo-bo doll by himself being physically punished.  Specifically the adult was pushed down in the video by the experimenter and hit with a newspaper while being berated.  This actual person-on-person violence actually decreased aggressive acts in the children, probably due to vicarious reinforcement.  Nonetheless these last results indicate that even young children don't automatically imitate aggression, but rather consider the context of aggression.

Given that some scholars estimate that children's viewing of violence in media is quite common, concerns about media often follow social learning theoretical approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beresin|first=Eugene|title=The Impact of Media Violence on Children and Adolescents: Opportunities for Clinical Interventions|url=http://www.aacap.org/cs/root/developmentor/the_impact_of_media_violence_on_children_and_adolescents_opportunities_for_clinical_interventions|publisher=American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social cognitive theory===
[[Social cognitive theories]] build upon social learning theory, but suggest that aggression may be activated by learning and priming aggressive scripts.  Desensitization and arousal/excitation are also included in latter social cognitive theories.  The concept of [[desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]] has particularly gotten much interest from the scholarly community and general public.  It is theorized that with repeated exposure to media violence, a psychological saturation or emotional adjustment takes place such that initial levels of anxiety and disgust diminish or weaken.&lt;ref name="Sparks, G.G. 2008 pp. 269"/&gt;  For example, in one recent study, a sample of college students were assigned at random to play either a violent or [[non-violent video game]] for 20 minutes.  They were then asked to watch a 10-minute video of real life violence.  The students who had played the violent video games were observed to be significantly less affected by a simulated aggressive act than those who didn't play the violent video games.  However the degree to which the simulation was "believable" to the participants, or to which the participants may have responded to "demand characteristics" is unclear (see criticisms below).  Nonetheless, social cognitive theory was arguably the most dominant paradigm of media violence effects for many years, although it has come under recent criticism (e.g. Freedman, 2002; Savage, 2004).  Recent scholarship has suggested that social cognitive theories of aggression are outdated and should be retired.&lt;ref name="Ferguson &amp; Dyck, 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Christopher|title=Paradigm change in aggression research: The time has come to retire the General Aggression Model|journal=Aggression and Violence Behavior|year=2012|issue=3|pages=220–228|url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Paradigm%20Change.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2012.02.007|first2=Dominic|volume=17|last2=Dyck|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927103208/http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Paradigm%20Change.pdf|archivedate=2013-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars also argue that the continuous viewing of violent acts makes teenagers more susceptible to becoming violent themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mrug|first=Sylvie|date=January 1, 2016|title=Emotional Desensitization to Violence Contributes to Adolescents' Violent Behavior|journal=Journal of abnormal child psychology|volume=44|pages=75|via=NUI, Maynooth Library Search}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catalyst model===
One alternative theory is the catalyst model (Ferguson et al., 2008) which has been proposed to explain the etiology of violence.  The catalyst model is a new theory and has not been tested extensively.  According to the catalyst model, violence arises from a combination of genetic and early social influences (family and peers in particular).  According to this model, media violence is explicitly considered a weak causal influence.  Specific violent acts are "catalyzed" by stressful environment circumstances, with less stress required to catalyze violence in individuals with greater violence predisposition.  Some early work has supported this view (e.g. Ferguson et al., 2008).  Recent research with inmates has, likewise, provided support for the catalyst model.&lt;ref name="Surette, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Surette|first=Ray|title=Cause or catalyst: The interaction of real world and media crime models|journal=American Journal of Criminal Justice|year=2013|issue=38|pages=392–409|doi=10.1007/s12103-012-9177-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, as suggested by the catalyst model, perpetrators of crimes sometimes included stylistic elements or behaviors in their crimes they had seen in media, but the motivation to commit crimes itself was unrelated to media viewing.

===Moral panic theory===
A final theory relevant to this area is the [[moral panic]]. Elucidated largely by [[David Gauntlett]],&lt;ref name="dg4"&gt;David Gauntlett (2005), [http://www.theory.org.uk/david/book7.htm Moving Experiences, second edition: Media Effects and Beyond], London: John Libbey&lt;/ref&gt; this theory postulates that concerns about new media are historical and cyclical. In this view, a society forms a predetermined negative belief about a new medium—typically not used by the elder and more powerful members of the society. Research studies and positions taken by scholars and politicians tend to confirm the pre-existing belief, rather than dispassionately observe and evaluate the issue. Eventually the panic dies out after several years or decades, but ultimately resurfaces when yet another new medium is introduced.

==Criticisms==
Although organizations such as the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] and the [[American Psychological Association]] have suggested that thousands (3500 according to the AAP) of studies have been conducted confirming this link, others have argued that this information is incorrect. Rather, only about two hundred studies (confirmed by meta-analyses such as Paik and Comstock, 1994) have been conducted in peer-reviewed scientific journals on television, film, music and video game violence effects. Critics argue that about half find some link between media and subsequent aggression (but not violent crime), whereas the other half do not find a link between consuming violent media and subsequent aggression of any kind.&lt;ref name="freedman2002"&gt;Freedman, Jonathan L. (2002). ''Media violence and its effect on aggression: Assessing the scientific evidence.'' Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-8020-3553-0}} {{page needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms of the media violence link focus on a number of methodological and theoretical problems including (but not limited to) the following (see Bryce &amp; Kaye, 2011; Freedman, 2002; Olson, 2004; Tedeschi &amp; Quigley, 1996; Pinker, 2002):

# Failure to adequately control experimental conditions when assessing aggressive outcomes between violent and non-violent games (see Adachi &amp; Willoughby, 2010). Traditionally, researchers have selected one violent game and one non-violent game, yet shown little consideration of the potentially different responses to these games as a result of differences in other game characteristics (e.g., level of action, frustration, enjoyment).
# Failure to acknowledge the role of social contexts in which media violence is experienced. Within theoretical models explaining the influence of violent video game exposure on aggressive attitudes and behaviour, no acknowledgement is made towards understanding the influence of social gaming experiences and contexts on these outcomes. That is, differential outcomes of gaming arise as a result of different social contexts (online versus offline gaming) and social dynamics involved in social gaming experiences (Kaye &amp; Bryce, 2012). Existing theoretical models assume that the outcomes of gaming are equivalent, regardless of these different contexts. This is a key limitation of current theory within media violence research
# ''Failure to employ [[standardization|standardized]], [[Reliability (statistics)|reliable]] and [[Validity (logic)|valid]] measures of aggression and media violence exposure.''  Although measurement of psychological variables is always tricky at best, it is generally accepted that measurement techniques should be standardized, reliable and valid, as demonstrated empirically.  However, some scholars argue that the measurement tools involved are often unstandardized, sloppily employed and fail to report reliability coefficients.  Examples include the "Competitive Reaction Time Test" in which participants believe that they are punishing an opponent for losing in a reaction time test by subjecting the opponent to noise blasts or electric shocks.  There is no standardized way of employing this task, raising the possibility that authors may manipulate the results to support their conclusions.  This task may produce dozens of different possible ways to measure "aggression", all from a single participant's data.  Without a standardized way of employing and measuring aggression using this task, there is no way of knowing whether the results reported are a valid measure of aggression, or were selected from among the possible alternatives simply because they produced positive findings where other alternatives did not. Ferguson and Kilburn, in a paper in Journal of Pediatrics, have found that poorly standardized and validated measures of aggression tend to produce higher effects than well validated aggression measures.
# ''Failure to report negative findings.'' Some scholars contend that many of the articles that purport positive findings regarding a link between media violence and subsequent aggression, on a closer read, actually have negative or inconclusive results. One example is the experimental portion of Anderson &amp; Dill (2000; with video games) which measures aggression four separate ways (using an unstandardized, unreliable and unvalidated measure of aggression, the Competitive Reaction Time Test mentioned above) and finds significance for only one of those measures. Had a statistical adjustment known as a [[Bonferroni correction]] been properly employed, that fourth finding also would have been insignificant. This issue of selective reporting differs from the "file drawer" effect in which journals fail to publish articles with negative findings.  Rather, this is due to authors finding a "mixed bag" of results and discussing only the supportive findings and ignoring the negative findings within a single manuscript.  The problem of non-reporting of non-significant findings (the so-called "[[publication bias|file cabinet effect]]") is a problem throughout all areas of science but may be a particular issue for publicized areas such as media violence. 
# ''Failure to account for "third" variables.'' Some scholars contend that media violence studies regularly fail to account for other variables such as genetics, personality and exposure to family violence that may explain both why some people become violent and why those same people may choose to expose themselves to violent media. Several recent studies have found that, when factors such as mental health, family environment and personality are controlled, no predictive relationship between either video games or television violence and youth violence remain (Ferguson, San Miguel &amp; Hartley, 2009; Ybarra et al., 2008, Figure 2).
# ''Failure to adequately define "aggression."''  Experimental measures of [[aggression]] have been questioned by critics (Mussen &amp; Rutherford, 1961; Deselms &amp; Altman, 2003). The main concern of critics has been the issue of the [[external validity]] of experimental measures of aggression.  The validity of the concept of aggression itself, however, is rarely questioned.  Highly detailed taxonomies of different forms of aggression do exist.  Whether researchers agree on the particular terminology used to indicate the particular sub-types of aggression (i.e. relational versus social aggression), concepts of aggression are always operationally defined in peer-reviewed journals.  However many of these operational definitions of aggression are specifically criticized.   Many experimental measures of aggression are rather questionable (i.e. Mussen &amp; Rutherford, 1961; Berkowitz, 1965; Bushman &amp; Anderson, 2002; Deselms &amp; Altman, 2003). Other studies fail to differentiate between "aggression" aimed at causing harm to another person, and "aggressive play" in which two individuals (usually children) may pretend to engage in aggressive behavior, but do so consensually for the purpose of mutual enjoyment. (Goldstein)
# ''Small "effects" sizes.'' In the research world, the meaning of "[[statistical significance]]" can be ambiguous.  A measure of effect size can aid in the interpretation of statistical significance. In a meta-analysis of 217 studies by Paik and Comstock (1994), effect sizes for experiments were r = .37 and r = .19 for surveys, which are small to moderate effects.  Most of these studies however did not actually measure aggression against another person.  Paik and Comstock note that when aggression toward another person, and particularly actual violent crime is considered, the relationship between media violence and these outcomes is near zero.  Effects can vary according to their size (for example the effects of eating bananas on your mood could very well be "statistically significant" but would be tiny, almost imperceptible, whereas the effect of a death in the immediate family would also be "statistically significant" but obviously much larger). Media violence studies usually produce very small, transient effects that do not translate into large effects in the real world. Media violence researchers often defend this by stating that many medical studies also produce small effects (although as Block and Crain, 2007, note, these researchers may have miscalculated the effect sizes from medical research). 
# ''Media violence rates are not correlated with violent crime rates.'' One limitation of theories linking media violence to societal violence is that media violence (which appears to have been consistently and unfailingly on the rise since the 1950s) should be correlated with violent crime (which has been cycling up and down throughout human history). By discussing only the data from the 1950s through the 1990s, media violence researchers create the illusion that there is a correlation, when in fact there is not. Large spikes in violent crime in the United States occurred without associated media violence spikes during the 1880s (when records were first kept) and 1930s. The homicide rate in the United States has never been higher than during the 1930s. Similarly, this theory fails to explain why violent crime rates (including among juveniles) dramatically fell in the mid 1990s and have stayed low, during a time when media violence has continued to increase, and saw the addition of violent video games. Lastly media violence researchers can not explain why many countries with media violence rates similar to or equal to the U.S. (such as Norway, Canada, Japan, etc.) have much lower violent crime rates. Huesmann &amp; Eron's own cross-national study (which is often cited in support of media violence effects) failed to find a link between television violence and aggressive behavior in most of the countries included in the analysis (including America, and even in studies on American boys).
#''Media violence on TV is a reflection of the level of violence that occurs in the real world''.  Many TV programmers argue that their shows just mirror the violence that goes on in the real world.  Zev Braun, of CBS, in 1990 argued in a debate on the Violence Bill that, "We live in a violent society.  Art imitates modes of life, not the other way around: it would be better for Congress to clean that society than to clean that reflection of society."&lt;ref name="Anderson, C. A. 2001"&gt;Anderson, C. A. &amp; Bushman, B. J. (2001) Media Violence and the American Public: Scientific Facts Versus Media Misinformation. ''American Psychologist''&lt;/ref&gt;
''Culture and Media Violence''
The majority of this research derives from American communication and psychological research. Concerns about the 'effect' of media violence is far less prominent in public and academic discourse in Europe and other parts of the developed world. To a large degree, this is because European and Australian scholars, in particular, recognise that the relationship between media and culture is a great deal more complex than is often conceded by psychological and communications research in North America.  There is a recognition that culture is critical to our understanding of these complexities, and that there are no clear causal relations between culture, media, politics and human violence. They simply work in complicated ways through and upon one another through social interactions and history.&lt;ref&gt;''Media, Culture and Human Violence''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to criticisms==

#Social science uses randomized experiments to control for possible differences between media conditions, although these must be done with care.  In a typical study, children or young adults are randomly assigned to different media conditions and then are observed when given an opportunity to be aggressive. Researchers who argue for causal effects have defended their work that is based on well-established methodological and statistical theory and on empirical data.&lt;ref&gt;name=Bushman, Rothstein, &amp; Anderson (2010), [http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/faculty/caa/abstracts/2010-2014/10BRA.pdf Much Ado About Something: Violent Video Game Effects and a School of Red Herring: Reply to Ferguson and Kilburn (2010)], American Psychological Association&lt;/ref&gt;
#Regarding the inconclusive nature of some findings, media researchers who argue for causal effects often contend that it is the critics who are misinterpreting or selectively reporting studies (Anderson et al., 2003).  It may be that both sides of the debate are highlighting separate findings that are most favorable to their own "cause".
#Regarding "third" variables, media violence researchers who argue for causal effects acknowledge that other variables may play a role in aggression (Bushman &amp; Anderson, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bushman | first1 = B.J. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = C.A. | year = 2001 | title = Media violence and the American public: Scientific facts versus media misinformation | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 56 | issue = 6–7| pages = 477–489 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.56.6-7.477| pmid = 11413871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that aggression is due to a confluence of variables. These variables are known as "third variables" and if found, would probably be ''[[mediator variable]]s'' (which differ from'' [[moderator variable]]s''). A mediator variable could 'explain away' media violence effects, whereas a moderator variable cannot. For instance, some scholars contend that trait aggressiveness has been demonstrated to moderate media violence effects (Bushman), although in some studies "trait aggression" does appear to account for any link between media violence exposure and aggression. Other variables have also been found to moderate media violence effects (Bushman &amp; Geen, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bushman | first1 = B.J. | last2 = Green | first2 = R.G. | year = 1990 | title = Role of cognitive-emotional mediators and individual differences in the effects of media violence on aggression | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 1| pages = 156–163 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.1.156| pmid = 2308072 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue is the way in which experimental studies deal with potential confounding variables. Researchers use random assignment to attempt to neutralize the effects of what commonly are cited as third variables (i.e. gender, trait aggressiveness, preference for violent media). Because experimental designs employ random assignment to conditions, the effect of such attributive variables on experimental results is assumed to be random (not systematic).  However, the same can not be said for correlational studies, and failure to control for such variables in correlational studies limits the interpretation of such studies.  Often, something as simple as gender proves capable of "mediating" media violence effects.
#Regarding aggression, the problem may have less to do with the definition of aggression, but rather how aggression is measured in studies, and how aggression and violent crime are used interchangeably in the public eye.
#Much of the debate on this issue seems to revolve around ambiguity regarding what is considered a "small" effect.  Media violence researchers who argue for causal effects contend that effect sizes noted in media violence effects are similar to those found in some medical research which is considered important by the medical community (Bushman &amp; Anderson, 2001), although medical research may suffer from some of the same interpretational flaws as social science.  This argument has been challenged as based on flawed statistics, however (Block &amp; Crain, 2007).  Block &amp; Crain (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Block | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Crain | first2 = B.R. | year = 2007 | title = Omissions and errors in "Media Violence and the American Public | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 252–253 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.62.3.252| pmid = 17469907 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recently found that social scientists (Bushman &amp; Anderson, 2001) had been miscalculating some medical effect sizes.  The interpretation of effect size in both medical and social science remains in its infancy.
#More recently, media violence researchers who argue for causal effects have acknowledged that societal [[media consumption]] and violent crime rates are not well associated, but claim that this is likely due to other variables that are poorly understood.  However, this effect remains poorly explained by current media violence theories, and media violence researchers may need to be more careful not to retreat to an [[unfalsifiable]] theory&amp;nbsp;– one that cannot be disproven (Freedman, 2002).
#Researchers  who argue for causal effects argue that the discrepancy of violent acts seen on TV compared to that in the real world are huge.  One study looked at the frequency of crimes occurring in the real world compared with the frequency of crimes occurring in the following reality-based TV programs: America's Most Wanted, Cops, Top Cops, FBI, The Untold Story and American Detective, (Oliver, 1994). The types of crimes were divided into two categories, violent crimes and non-violent crimes.  87% of crimes occurring in the real world are non-violent crimes, whereas only 13% of crimes occurring on TV are considered non-violent crimes.&lt;ref name="Anderson, C. A. 2001"/&gt;  However, this discrepancy between media and real-life crimes may arguably dispute rather than support media effects theories.  Some previous research linked boxing matches to homicides&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, D.P. (1986).

Berkowitz (Ed.), ''Advances in experimental social psychology'' (Vol.19, pp.207-250). Orlando, FL: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; although other researchers consider such linkages to be reminiscent of ecological fallacies (e.g. Freedman, 2002). Much more research is required to actually establish any causal effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = C.

==Media violence and youth violence==
On average, children in the United States spend six hours a day connected to media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jason | first1 = L.

==Relationship between media violence and minor aggressive behaviors==

Given that little evidence links media violence to serious physical aggression, bullying or youth violence,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; at present most of the debate appears to focus on whether media violence may influence more minor forms of aggressiveness. An article done in 1987 reviewing a history of court cases dealing with violent acts of youths showed that the courts were hesitant to hold media at fault for the violent acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Dee Lushbough|first = Juliet|date = 1987-06-01|title = Media Accountability for Real-Life Violence: A Case of Negligence or Free Speech?|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1987.tb00986.x/abstract|journal = Journal of Communication|language = en|volume = 37|issue = 2|pages = 106–139|doi = 10.1111/j.1460-2466.1987.tb00986.x|issn = 1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, no consensus has been reached on this issue. For example, in 1974 the US Surgeon General testified to congress that "the overwhelming consensus and the unanimous Scientific Advisory Committee's report indicates that televised violence, indeed, does have an adverse effect on certain members of our society."&lt;ref name="APS"&gt;[http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/pspi/pspi43.pdf American Psychological Society]&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2001, the US Surgeon General's office, The Department of Health and Human Services had largely reversed itself, relegating media violence to only a minor role and noting many serious limitations in the research.&lt;ref name="Department of Health And Human Services"&gt;[http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/youthviolence/report.html Department of Health And Human Services]&lt;/ref&gt; Studies, have also disagreed regarding whether media violence contributes to desensitization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fanti|first=Kostas|title=Desensitization To Media Violence Over A Short Period of Time|journal=Aggressive Behavior|year=2009|volume=35|pages=179–187|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=ff3fe166-b536-4ac1-b8fe-1f2206068aa2%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=106|accessdate=11 July 2012|doi=10.1002/ab.20295|pmid=19172659|first2=E|last3=Henrich|first3=CC|last4=Avraamides|first4=MN|issue=2|last2=Vanman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramos|first=Raul|title=Desensitization Comfortably numb or just yet another movie?

===Media violence and cultural studies===
Much of the research on media and violence derives from the United States, particularly the related research fields of psychology and media/communication studies. Research in Europe and Australia on the relationship between media and violence is far broader and is much more clearly embedded in politics, culture and social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;B. Lewis and J. Lewis, Health Communication: A Media and Cultural Studies Approach, Palgrave, London, Ch.s 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jeff Lewis (professor)|Jeff Lewis]]' book ''Media Culture and Human Violence'' challenges the conventional approaches to media violence research.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Lewis (2015) Media, Culture and Human Violence, Rowman and Littlefield, Lanham, MD.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis argues that violence is largely generated through the interaction of social processes and modes of thinking which are constantly refreshed through the media, politics and other cultural discourses. Violence is continually presented as 'authorised' or 'legitimate' within government, legal and narrative media texts. Accordingly, Lewis disputes with the proposition that violence is 'natural' or that violence is ''caused'' by media of any sort. Rather, media interacts with culturally generated and inherited modes of thinking or 'consciousness' to create the conditions in which violence can occur. These forms of 'violence thinking' are embedded in historically rooted processes of hierarchical social organisation. These hierarchical organisational systems shape our knowledge and beliefs, creating a ferment in which violence is normalised and authorised by governments and other powerful institutions. The link between violence and the media is therefore very complex, but exists within the normative framework of modern culture. &lt;ref&gt;See also S. Critchley (2014) The Faith of the Faithless, Verso, New York; John Gray (2007) Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals, Farrarm Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Running of the Nudes''', like the well-known [[Running of the Bulls]], takes place in [[Pamplona]], [[Spain]]. The Running of the Nudes occurs two days before the Running of the Bulls, just before the start of the nine-day festival of [[San Fermín]]. The event was created in 2002 and is supported by animal welfare groups, including [[PETA]], who object to the Running of the Bulls, claiming that the event is cruel and glorifies [[bullfighting]], which the groups oppose. In the Running of the Nudes, naked humans, many wearing only plastic horns and red scarves, follow the same route taken by the Running of the Bulls, from the Santo Domingo corrals through the town’s streets, ending at the Plaza de Toros. The length of the run is some 800 metres (about half a mile) and the event takes about one hour.

==History==
In 2002, approximately 25 naked [[streaking|streaker]]s ran through Pamplona's winding streets to promote an alternative to the Running of the Bulls. Subsequent events saw a steady increase in the numbers of runners with an estimated 1000 nude or semi-nude runners taking part in the event in 2006.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.istc.org/sisp/?fx=event&amp;event_id=112893 |title=Student Travel Information |accessdate=2007-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050725073412/http://www.istc.org/sisp/?fx=event&amp;event_id=112893 |archivedate=2005-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Animal welfare]] groups across Europe and in North America have promoted the event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prijatelji-zivotinja.hr/index.en.php?id=613 |title=AFC - 07/03/06 Running of the Nudes |publisher=Prijatelji-zivotinja.hr |date= |accessdate=2011-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aran.ie/pamplona.html |title=Aran.ie |publisher=Aran.ie |date=2011-01-18 |accessdate=2011-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721121938/http://aran.ie/pamplona.html |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; coordinating low-cost transportation and accommodations for the runners. The event has become an annual alternative festival to the Running of the Bulls. Local citizens, initially offended by the public display of nudity, have become more accepting due to changing morals and because the new event has extended the traditional festival and added to its important economic impact for the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=85&amp;story_id=27999 |title=A guide to Spain's major festivals |publisher=Expatica |date= |accessdate=2011-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizers work with local government to obtain permits and provide insurance, as required by local law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.runningofthenudes.com/past_events.asp |title=Out With The Old-In With the Nude! // Past Events |publisher=Running Of The Nudes |date= |accessdate=2011-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rural Free Delivery''' ('''RFD''') is a service which began in the United States in the late 19th century, to deliver mail directly to rural farm families. Prior to RFD, individuals living in more remote homesteads had to pick up mail themselves at sometimes distant post offices or pay private carriers for [[Delivery (commerce)|delivery]] (this fee was in addition to the postage paid by the mailer).  RFD became a [[political football]], with politicians promising it to voters and using it themselves to reach voters. The proposal to offer free rural delivery was not universally embraced. Private carriers and local shopkeepers feared a loss of business.  The [[United States Post Office Department]] began experiments with Rural Free Delivery as early as 1890. However, it was not until 1893, when Georgia Congressman [[Thomas E. Watson]] pushed through legislation, that the practice was mandated.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/512968/Rural-Free-Delivery-RFD  Encyclopædia Britannica - Rural Free Delivery]&lt;/ref&gt; However, universal implementation was slow; RFD was not adopted generally in the [[United States Postal Service|United States Post Office]] until 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rural Free Delivery|url=http://www.usps.com/postalhistory/_pdf/RuralFreeDelivery.pdf|publisher=United States Postal Service|accessdate=April 17, 2011|author=Historian United States Postal Service|date=May 2007|quote=On October 1, 1890, Congress authorized funding of $10,000 to test the "practicability" of delivering mail to small towns, defined as those having populations of from 300 to 5,000 people, and nearby rural districts..}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rural delivery service uses a network of rural routes traveled by carriers to deliver and pick up mail to and from roadside mailboxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2b2c_ruralmailbox.html| title=Rural Mailboxes|publisher=[[National Postal Museum]]| accessdate= 2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Rural carrier in automobile at mailboxes, c.1910.jpg|thumb|Rural carrier in an early [[electric vehicle]], circa 1910]]

Until the late 19th century, residents of rural areas had to either travel to a distant [[post office]] to pick up their mail, or else pay for delivery by a private carrier.  Postmaster General [[John Wanamaker]], owner of a major department store, was ardently in favor of Rural Free Delivery (RFD), with many thousands of Americans living in rural communities who wanted to send and receive retail orders inexpensively. However, the adoption of a nationwide RFD system had many opponents. Some were simply opposed to the cost of the service.  Private [[Package delivery|express carriers]] thought inexpensive rural mail delivery would eliminate their business, and many town merchants worried the service would reduce farm families' weekly visits to town to obtain goods and merchandise, or that [[mail order]] merchants selling through [[Sears catalog|catalogs]], such as [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]] might present significant competition.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name = mc-dch-2007-26&gt;{{Cite journal

| quote = Did You Know?  'Neither snow nor rain .....'  Contrary to popular belief, the quote at the beginning of this article is not the official motto of the U.S. Postal Service. According to the Postal Service, this inscription was supplied by [[William Mitchell Kendall]] of the firm [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]], the architects who designed the New York General Post Office building in 1912. Kendall explained that the sentence appears in the works of [[Herodotus]] and describes the expedition of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] against the [[Persian Empire|Persians]] under [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], about [[500 B.C.]] The Persians operated a system of mounted postal couriers, and the sentence describes the fidelity with which their work was done.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the introduction of a nationwide rural mail delivery service came from [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry]], the nation's oldest agricultural organization.

[[Fayette County, Indiana|Fayette County]] in east-central  Indiana claims to be the birthplace of Rural Free Delivery.  Milton Trusler, a leading farmer in the county, began advocating the idea in 1880; as the president of the Indiana Grange, he spoke to farmers statewide frequently over the following sixteen years.&lt;ref&gt;Division of Historic Preservation and Archeology.  ''Fayette County Interim Report''.  [[Indianapolis]]: [[Indiana Department of Natural Resources]], 1981-07, xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Post Office Department first experimented with the idea of rural mail delivery on October 1, 1891 to determine the viability of RFD. They began with five routes covering ten miles, 33 years after free delivery in cities had begun. The first routes to receive RFD during its experimental phase were in [[Jefferson County, West Virginia]], near [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], [[Halltown, West Virginia|Halltown]], and [[Uvilla, West Virginia|Uvilla]].&lt;ref name="first" /&gt;

Legislation by [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] [[Thomas E. Watson]] of Georgia mandated the practice, and RFD finally became an official service in 1896.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; That year, 82 rural routes were put into operation. A massive undertaking, nationwide RFD service took several years to implement, and remains the "biggest and most expensive endeavor"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/ref/nchistory/oct2006/index.html|title=This Month in North Carolina History|author=Harry McKown|date=2006-10-31| publisher=[[University of North Carolina]]| work=This Month in North Carolina History}}&lt;/ref&gt; ever instituted by the U.S. postal service.

The service has grown steadily. By 1901, the mileage had increased to over 100,000; the cost was $1,750,321 and over 37,000 carriers were employed. In 1910 the mileage was 993,068; cost $36,915,000; carriers 40,997. In 1913 came the introduction of [[parcel post]] delivery, which caused another boom in rural deliveries. Parcel post service allowed the distribution of national newspapers and magazines, and was responsible for millions of dollars of sales in [[Mail order|mail-order]] merchandise to customers in rural areas. In 1930 there were 43,278 rural routes serving about 6,875,321 families—that is about 25,471,735 persons. The cost was $106,338,341.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.si.edu/ondisplay/parcelpost/cf/view.cfm|title=Parcel Post: Delivery of Dreams| publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, the [[Rural Post "Good" Roads Act of 1916|Rural Post "Good" Roads Act]] authorized federal funds for rural post roads.

{{Violence against women}}

==Overview==
[[Uganda]] has over 234,000 refugees and 65 percent are from [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[South Sudan]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title=Refugee women in Uganda suffer sex abuse''|url=https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1335355/refugee-women-uganda-suffer-sex-abuse|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The other refugees in Uganda come from [[Ethiopia]], [[Somalia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Burundi]], and [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Refugees in Uganda|url=http://www.refugeandhope.org/refugees-in-Uganda|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overall situation==
Some of the refugees in [[Ugandan]] camps are sexually harassed and beaten. These include mostly women, girls and few boys who are between the ages of 14 and 25. These harassments happen across the different refugee settlements in [[Uganda]]. These are sexually harassed and beaten. A survey conducted by Pan African Development Education and Advocacy Programme (PADEAP) in 2012 under the country director; Michael Mafabi revealed that 70% of the women experienced one form of violence, more so with about 45% of them being sexually abused.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
According to Mafabi, the victims rarely report these incidences because the culprits have power over them.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
These culprits are the people who provide relief to these refugees. Also, Mafabi indicates that when some of these victims go to report, they are harassed in exchange for services.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Causes==
Debanjana Choudhuri who visited one of the camps in [[Uganda]] has reported that according to the data she got, girls frequently experience coerced sexual initiation which they view it as a normal form of relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Choudhuri|first1=Debanjana|title=My Visit To A Ugandan Refugee Camp: Tackling Gender-Based Violence And HIV|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.in/debanjana-choudhuri/tackling-sgbv-and-hiv-in-_b_8174562.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source mentioned that culture and religion influence refugees to be victims of abuse and the fact that they fear to be embarrassed if they say anything against what they are experiencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jeff and Dennis|first1=Lule and  Dibele|title=Refugee  women and children in different settlements around the country, continue to be exposed to sexual abuse, allegedly by some humanitarian service providers and security officials.|url=https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1335355/refugee-women-uganda-suffer-sex-abuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culprits==
The culprits are a secretive network of pimps operating in [[Uganda]]. The group mostly spread information about their business through word of mouth.

==Victims==
One of the victims of sexual harassment include a girl who flee from [[South Sudan]] camp after being raped , only to be raped again in Ugandan camps.  
She explained that she lives alone and a lot of men come to her area at night and she gets scared. According to the source, there is nothing much she could have done to prevent herself from being raped because she lives in a tent that does not have a door.More other girls who experienced the same thing as the one form [[South Sudan]] claimed that they also live in fear of being attacked by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girls flee sexual violence in South Sudan only to be raped again in refugee camp|url=https://news.trust.org/item/20171004084050-y6bzq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Capitalism |Systems}}
'''State capitalism''' is an [[economic system]] in which the [[State (polity)|state]] undertakes commercial (i.e. [[Profit (economics)|for-profit]]) economic activity and where the [[means of production]] are organized and managed as [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned business enterprises]] (including the processes of [[capital accumulation]], [[wage labor]] and [[Centralisation|centralized management]]), or where there is otherwise a dominance of [[Corporatization|corporatized]] government agencies (agencies organized along business-management practices) or of [[Public company|publicly listed corporations]] in which the state has controlling shares.&lt;ref&gt;

The term "state capitalism" is also used by some in reference to a private capitalist economy controlled by a state, often meaning a privately owned economy that is subject to [[statist]] economic planning. This term was often used to describe the controlled economies of the [[Great Powers]] in the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought|editor1=David Miller|editor2=Janet Coleman|editor3=William Conolly|editor4=Alan Ryan|publisher=Blackwell|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; State capitalism has also come to refer to an economic system where the means of production are owned privately, but the state has considerable control over the allocation of [[Credit (finance)|credit]] and investment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Works of Mikhail Bakunin 1873|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1873/statism-anarchy.htm|website=marxists.org|accessdate=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State capitalism|url=https://www.tititudorancea.com/z/state_capitalism.htm|website=tititudorancea.com|accessdate=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in the case of France during the period of [[dirigisme]] after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. State capitalism may be used (sometimes interchangeably with [[state monopoly capitalism]]) to describe a system where the state intervenes in the economy to protect and advance the interests of [[Big business|large-scale businesses]].

[[Libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialist]] [[Noam Chomsky]] applies the term "state capitalism" to economies such as that of the [[United States]], where large enterprises that are deemed "too big to fail" receive publicly funded government bailouts that mitigate the firms' assumption of risk and undermine market laws and where the state largely funds private production [[Lemon socialism|at public expense, but private owners reap the profits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chomsky.info/20110407-2/|title=The State-Corporate Complex: A Threat to Freedom and Survival|author=Noam Chomsky|date=7 April 2011|publisher=Chomsky.info|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History Doesn't Go In a Straight Line {{!}} Jacobin|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/09/noam-chomsky-bernie-sanders-greece-tsipras-grexit-austerity-neoliberalism-protest/|website=jacobinmag.com|accessdate=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State and Corp., Noam Chomsky interviewed by uncredited interviewer|url=http://chomsky.info/20050518/|website=chomsky.info|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is often claimed to be in contrast with the ideals of both [[socialism]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Allan G. Johnson. ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology''. (2000). Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|0-631-21681-2}}. p. 306. In 2008, the U.S. National Intelligence Council used the term in ''Global Trends 2025: A World Transformed'' to describe the development of Russia, India and China.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various theories and critiques of state capitalism, some of which existed before the 1917 [[October Revolution]]. The common themes among them identify that the workers do not meaningfully control the means of production and detect that commodity relations and production for profit still occur within state capitalism. In ''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific'' (1880), [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that state ownership does not do away with capitalism by itself, but rather would be the final stage of capitalism, consisting of ownership and management of large-scale production and communication by the [[Capitalist state|bourgeois state]]. He argued that the tools for ending capitalism are found in state capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frederick Engels |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm |title=Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (Chpt. 3)|website=marxists.org|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and early uses of the term==
[[File:Wilhelm Liebknecht 2.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm Liebknecht]]: "Nobody has combated State Socialism more than we German Socialists"]]
The term was first used by [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] in 1896 who said: "Nobody has combated [[State Socialism (Germany)|State Socialism]] more than we [[German socialism|German Socialists]]; nobody has shown more distinctively than I, that State Socialism is really State capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Wilhelm|last=Liebknecht|authorlink=Wilhelm Liebknecht|title=Our Recent Congress|journal=Justice|year=1896|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/liebknecht-w/1896/08/our-congress.htm|accessdate=May 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the concept of state capitalism can be traced back to [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s critique during the [[First International]] of the potential for state exploitation under Marxist-inspired socialism, or to [[Jan Waclav Machajski]]'s argument in ''The Intellectual Worker'' (1905) that socialism was a movement of the [[intelligentsia]] as a class, resulting in a new type of society he termed state capitalism.&lt;ref name="Fox - Ante Ciliga" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Slavic Review'', 50, no. 1 (Spring 1991): 127-143. Published in Croatian translation in ?asopis za suvremenu povijest [Journal of Contemporary History], Zagreb, no. 3, 1994, 427-450.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Bakunin: Gouldner, A.W. 1982. 'Marx's last battle: Bakunin and the First International', ''Theory and Society'' 11(6), November, pp. 853-84. Gouldner argues that Bakunin formulated an original critique of Marxism as 'the ideology, not of the working class, but of a new class of scientific intelligentsia—who would corrupt socialism, make themselves a new elite, and impose their rule on the majority' (pp. 860-1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Machajski: [[Marshall S. Shatz]] {{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/cont.html|title=''Jan Waclaw Machajski: A Radical Critic Of The Russian Intelligentsia And Socialism''|accessdate=October 26, 2009|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026180626/http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/cont.html|archivedate=October 26, 2009|df=}}; TB Bottomore ''Elites and Society'' p.54&lt;/ref&gt; For anarchists, [[state socialism]] is equivalent to state capitalism, hence oppressive and merely a shift from private capitalists to the state being the sole employer and capitalist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secH3.html#sech313] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219024910/http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secH3.html#sech313|date=December 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], using [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s idea that [[Czarism]] was taking a "Prussian path" to capitalism, the [[Bolshevik]] [[Nikolai Bukharin]] identified a new stage in the development of capitalism in which all sectors of national production and all important social institutions had become managed by the state—he termed this new stage "state capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Bukharin, N. 1915 [1972]. ''Imperialism and World Economy''. London: Merlin. p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

After the October Revolution, Lenin used the term positively. In spring 1918, during a brief period of economic liberalism prior to the introduction of [[war communism]] and again during the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) of 1921, Lenin justified the introduction of state capitalism controlled politically by the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] to further central control and develop the productive forces: &lt;blockquote&gt;Reality tells us that state capitalism would be a step forward. If in a small space of time we could achieve state capitalism, that would be a victory.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/cw/volume27.htm Collected Works Vol. 27], p. 293, quoted by [http://www.geocities.com/aufheben2/auf_6_ussr1.html Aufheben]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also David S. Pena "[http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/5869/ Tasks of Working-Class Governments under the Socialist-oriented Market Economy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905230042/http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/5869/|date=September 5, 2008}}", PoliticalAffairs.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lenin argued the state should temporarily run the economy, which would eventually be taken over by workers.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm#s4|title=The State and Revolution — Chapter 5 |publisher=[[Marxists.org]]|date=March 25, 2006|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Lenin, "state capitalism" did not mean the state would run most of the economy, but that "state capitalism" would be one of five elements of the economy:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; {{quote|text=State capitalism would be a step forward as compared with the present state of affairs in our Soviet Republic. If in approximately six months' time state capitalism became established in our Republic, this would be a great success and a sure guarantee that within a year socialism will have gained a permanently firm hold.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1921/apr/21.htm|title=The Tax in Kind|publisher=[[Marxists.org]]|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Use of the term by the left==

===Socialists===
The term "state capitalism" has been used by various [[socialists]], including [[anarchists]], [[Marxists]] and [[Leninists]].

===Anarchists ===
Perhaps the earliest critique of the [[Soviet Union]] as state capitalist was formulated by the Russian anarchists as documented in Paul Avrich's work on Russian anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Avrich, 1967, ''The Russian Anarchists'', Princeton University Press, chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

This claim would become standard in anarchist works. For example, the prominent anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] in an article from 1935 titled "There Is No Communism in Russia" said of the Soviet Union: &lt;blockquote&gt;Such a condition of affairs may be called state capitalism, but it would be fantastic to consider it in any sense Communistic [...] Soviet Russia, it must now be obvious, is an absolute despotism politically and the crassest form of state capitalism economically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/emma-goldman-there-is-no-communism-in-russia|title=There Is No Communism in Russia|author=Emma Goldman|date=1935|work=The Anarchist Library|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When speaking about [[Marxism]], [[Murray Bookchin]] said the following: &lt;blockquote&gt;Marxism, in fact, becomes ideology. It is assimilated by the most advanced forms of state capitalist movement—notably Russia. By an incredible irony of history, Marxian 'socialism' turns out to be in large part the very state capitalism that Marx failed to anticipate in the dialectic of capitalism. The proletariat, instead of developing into a revolutionary class within the womb of capitalism, turns out to be an organ within the body of bourgeois society [...] Lenin sensed this and described 'socialism' as 'nothing but state capitalist monopoly made to benefit the whole people'. This is an extraordinary statement if one thinks out its implications, and a mouthful of contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-listen-marxist#fn_back9|title=Listen, Marxist!|author=Murray Bookchin|date=1971|work=The Anarchist Library|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While speaking about [[Leninism]], the authors of [[An Anarchist FAQ]] say: &lt;blockquote&gt;Rather than present an effective and efficient means of achieving revolution, the Leninist model is elitist, hierarchical and highly inefficient in achieving a socialist society. At best, these parties play a harmful role in the class struggle by alienating activists and militants with their organisational principles and manipulative tactics within popular structures and groups. At worse, these parties can seize power and create a new form of class society (a state capitalist one) in which the working class is oppressed by new bosses (namely, the party hierarchy and its appointees).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionH5#sech510|title=An Anarchist FAQ - H.5 What was the Kronstadt Rebellion? (What is vanguardism and why do anarchists reject it?)|date=|publisher=Infoshop|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Russian communist left===
{{Left communism sidebar}}
Another early analysis of the Soviet Union as state capitalist came from various groups advocating [[left communism]]. One major tendency of the [[Left communism#Russian left communism|1918 Russian communist left]] criticised the re-employment of [[authoritarian]] capitalist relations and methods of production. As [[Valerian Osinsky]] in particular argued, "one-man management" (rather than the democratic factory committees workers had established and Lenin abolished)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/brinton/1970/workers-control/02.htm|title=The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control: The State and Counter-Revolution|author=Maurice Brinton|date=1970|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other impositions of capitalist discipline would stifle the active participation of workers in the organisation of production—[[Taylorism]] converted workers into the appendages of machines and [[piece work]] imposed individualist rather than collective rewards in production so instilling [[petty bourgeois]] values into workers. In sum, these measures were seen as the re-transformation of proletarians within production from collective subject back into the atomised objects of capital. The working class, it was argued, had to participate consciously in economic as well as political administration. This tendency within the 1918 left communists emphasized that the problem with capitalist production was that it treated workers as objects. Its [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] lay in the workers' conscious creativity and participation, which is reminiscent of [[Marx's critique of alienation]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, W. and Buick, A. 1967. 'Soviet state capitalism? The history of an idea', ''Survey'' 62, January, pp. 58-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

These criticisms were revived on the left of the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik)|Russian Communist Party]] after the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|10th Congress]] in 1921, which introduced the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP). Many members of the [[Workers' Opposition]] and the [[Decists]] (both later banned) and two new underground Left Communist groups, [[Gavril Myasnikov]]'s Workers' Group and the Workers' Truth group, developed the idea that Russia was becoming a state capitalist society governed by a new bureaucratic class.&lt;ref name="Fox - Ante Ciliga" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EH Carr, ''The Interregnum 1923-1924'', London, 1954, p80&lt;/ref&gt; The most developed version of this idea was in a 1931 booklet by Myasnikov.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Shatz {{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/machg.html |title="Makhaevism After Machajski" |accessdate=2014-04-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027132629/http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/machg.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mensheviks and orthodox Marxists===
{{Marxism}}
Immediately after the Russian Revolution, many Western Marxists questioned whether socialism was possible in Russia. Specifically, [[Karl Kautsky]] said: {{quote|It is only the old feudal large landed property which exists no longer. Conditions in Russia were ripe for its abolition but they were not ripe for the abolition of capitalism. Capitalism is now once again celebrating a resurrection, but in forms that are more oppressive and harrowing for the proletariat than of old. Instead of assuming higher industrialised forms, private capitalism has assumed the most wretched and shabby forms of black marketeering and money speculation. Industrial capitalism has developed to become state capitalism. Formerly state officials and officials from private capital were critical, often very hostile towards each other. Consequently the working man found that his advantage lay with one or the other in turn. Today the state bureaucracy and capitalist bureaucracy are merged into one—that is the upshot of the great socialist revolution brought about by the Bolsheviks. It constitutes the most oppressive of all despotisms that Russia has ever had to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;Kautsky, K. 1919 [1983]. Terrorism and Communism. Cited from P. Goode (ed.), Karl Kautsky: Selected Political Writings. London: Macmillan, 1983, cited in [http://www.hetsa.org.au/pdf/34-A-08.pdf  'State Capitalism' in the Soviet Union M.C. Howard and J.E. King]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After 1929, exiled [[Mensheviks]] such as [[Fyodor Dan]] began to argue that Stalin's Russia constituted a state capitalist society.&lt;ref&gt;Liebich, A. 1987. 'Marxism and totalitarianism: Rudolf Hilferding and the Mensheviks', ''Dissent'' 34, Spring, pp. 223-40&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the orthodox Marxist group the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] independently developed a similar doctrine. Although initially beginning with the idea that Soviet capitalism differed little from western capitalism, they later began to argue that the bureaucracy held its productive property in common, much like the [[Catholic Church]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;State capitalism: the wages system under new management / Adam Buick and John Crump.  Basingstoke : Macmillan, 1986. {{ISBN|0-333-36775-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As John O'Neill notes: {{quote| Whatever other merits or problems their theories had, in arguing that the Russian revolution was from the outset a capitalist revolution they avoided the ad hoc and post hoc nature of more recent Maoist- and Trotskyist-inspired accounts of state capitalism, which start from the assumption that the Bolshevik revolution inaugurated a socialist economy that at some later stage degenerated into capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;STATE CAPITALISM - THE WAGES SYSTEM UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT - BUICK,A, CRUMP,J; ONEILL, J; POLITICAL QUARTERLY 59 (3): 398-399 JUL-SEP 1988&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Rudolf Hilferding]], writing in the Menshevik journal ''Socialist Courier'' April 25 1940 rejected the concept of state capitalism, noting that, as practiced in the Soviet Union, it lacked the dynamic aspects of capitalism such as a market which set prices or a set of entrepreneurs and investors which allocated capital. Thus, state capitalism was not a form of capitalism but a form of totalitarianism.&lt;ref name="Marxist"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Rudolf Hilferding |authorlink1=Rudolf Hilferding |title=State Capitalism or Totalitarian State Economy |website=marxists.org |publisher=Socialist Courier |accessdate=June 17, 2018 |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/hilferding/1940/statecapitalism.htm |date=April 25, 1940 |quote=A capitalist economy is governed by the laws of the market (analyzed by Marx) and the autonomy of these laws constitutes the decisive symptom of the capitalist system of production}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shachtmanite Trotskyists===
{{Third Camp}}
[[Leon Trotsky]] said the term state capitalism "originally arose to designate the phenomena which arise when a bourgeois state takes direct charge of the means of transport or of industrial enterprises" and is therefore a "partial negation" of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

After [[World War II]], [[Orthodox Trotskyism|most Trotskyists]] accepted an analysis of the Soviet bloc countries as being [[deformed workers' states]]. However, alternative opinions of the Trotskyist tradition have developed the theory of state capitalism as a [[New Class]] theory to explain what they regard as the essentially non-socialist nature of the Soviet Union, [[Cuba]], [[China]] and other self-proclaimed [[socialist states]].

The discussion goes back to internal debates in the [[Left Opposition]] during the late 1920s and early 1930s. [[Ante Ciliga]], a member of the Left Opposition imprisoned at Verkhne-Uralsk in the 1930s, described the evolution of many Left Oppositionists to a theory of state capitalism influenced by [[Gavril Myasnikov]]'s Workers Group and other Left Communist factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ante|last=Ciliga|title=Au pays du grand mensonge|year=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox - Ante Ciliga"&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael S.|last=Fox|url=http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/ciliga_trotsky.pdf |title=Ante Ciliga, Trotskii and State Capitalism: Theory, Tactics and Reevaluation during the Purge Era, 1935-1939 |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027132653/http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/ciliga_trotsky.pdf |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe Bourrinet]] "[http://www.left-dis.nl/uk/ciliga.htm An Ambiguous Journey]"&lt;/ref&gt; On release and returning to activity in the [[International Left Opposition]], Ciliga "was one of the first, after 1936, to raise the theory [of state capitalism] in Trotskyist circles".&lt;ref name="Fox - Ante Ciliga" /&gt; [[George Orwell]], who was an [[anti-Stalinist left]]ist like Ciliga, used the term in his ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938).

After 1940, dissident Trotskyists developed more theoretically sophisticated accounts of state capitalism. One influential formulation has been that of the [[Johnson–Forest Tendency]] of [[C. L. R. James]] and [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] who formulated her theory in the early 1940s on the basis of a study of the first three [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plan]]s alongside readings of Marx's [[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|early humanist writings]]. Their political evolution would lead them away from Trotskyism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gWA0AAAAIAAJ&amp;q= ''State-capitalism and World Revolution by Johnson-Forest''], Socialist Workers Party, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; Another is that of [[Tony Cliff]], associated with the [[International Socialist Tendency]] and the British [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP), dating back to the late 1940s. Unlike Johnson-Forest, Cliff formulated a theory of state capitalism that would enable his group to remain Trotskyists, albeit heterodox ones.&lt;ref&gt;Aufheben [http://libcom.org/library/what-was-the-ussr-aufheben-1 Cliff and the [[neo-Trotskyist]] theory of the USSR as state capitalist] in What Was The USSR?&lt;/ref&gt; A relatively recent text by [[Stephen Resnick]] and [[Richard D. Wolff]], ''Class Theory and History'', explores what they term state capitalism in the former Soviet Union, continuing a theme that has been debated within Trotskyist theory for most of the past century.

Compare with other left-wing theories regarding Soviet-style societies: [[deformed workers' state]]s, [[degenerated workers' state]]s, [[new class]], [[state socialism]] and [[bureaucratic collectivism]].

===Use by later left communists and council communists===
The [[left communist]]/[[council communist]] traditions outside Russia consider the Soviet system as state capitalist. [[Otto Rühle]], a major German left communist, developed this idea from the 1920s and it was later articulated by Dutch council communist [[Anton Pannekoek]], for instance in [http://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1936/dictatorship.htm "State Capitalism and Dictatorship"] (1936).

===Use by Maoists and anti-revisionists===
From 1956 to the late 1970s, the [[Communist Party of China]] and their [[Maoist]] or [[anti-revisionist]] adherents around the world often described the Soviet Union as state capitalist, essentially using the accepted Marxist definition, albeit on a different basis and in reference to a different span of time from either the Trotskyists or the left-communists. Specifically, the Maoists and their descendants use the term state capitalism as part of their description of the style and politics of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and his successors as well as to similar leaders and policies in other self-styled "socialist" states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mltranslations.org/Ireland/ico.htm ''The Economics of Revisionism''] by the Irish Communist Organisation, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; This was involved in the ideological [[Sino-Soviet Split]].

After [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, amidst the supporters of the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the "[[Gang of Four (China)|Gang of Four]]", most extended the state capitalist formulation to China itself and ceased to support the Communist Party of China, which likewise distanced itself from these former [[Fraternal party|fraternal]] groups. The related theory of [[Hoxhaism]] was developed in 1978, largely by [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Socialist Albanian]] President [[Enver Hoxha]], who insisted that Mao himself had pursued state capitalist and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/toc.htm ''Imperialism and the Revolution''] by Enver Hoxha, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most current communist groups descended from the Maoist ideological tradition still adopt the description of both China and the Soviet Union as being "state capitalist" from a certain point in their history onwards—most commonly, the Soviet Union from 1956 to its collapse in 1991 and China from 1976 to the present. Maoists and "anti-revisionists" also sometimes use the term "[[social imperialism]]" to describe socialist states that they consider to be actually capitalist in essence—their phrase, "socialist in words, imperialist in deeds" denotes this.

[[File:Murray Rothbard.jpg|thumb|left|Murray Rothbard advanced a [[right-libertarian]] analysis of state capitalism]]
[[Murray Rothbard]], an [[anarcho-capitalist]] philosopher, uses the term interchangeably with the term [[state monopoly capitalism]] and uses it to describe a partnership of government and big business in which the state intervenes on behalf of large capitalists against the interests of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

This usage dates from the 1960s, when [[Harry Elmer Barnes]] described the post-New Deal economy of the United States as "state capitalism".

The term is not used by the [[classical liberals]] to describe the public ownership of the means of production. The [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] explained the reason: "The socialist movement takes great pains to circulate frequently new labels for its ideally constructed state. Each worn-out label is replaced by another which raises hopes of an ultimate solution of the insoluble basic problem of Socialism—until it becomes obvious that nothing has been changed but the name. The most recent slogan is "State Capitalism." It is not commonly realized that this covers nothing more than what used to be called Planned Economy and State Socialism, and that State Capitalism, Planned Economy, and State Socialism diverge only in non-essentials from the "classic" ideal of egalitarian Socialism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Use by Italian Fascists==
[[File:Mussolini biografia.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Benito Mussolini]] claimed that the modern phase of capitalism is [[state socialism]] "turned on its head"]]
On economic issues, [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]] claimed in 1933 that were Fascism to follow the modern phase of capitalism, its path would "lead inexorably into state capitalism, which is nothing more nor less than [[state socialism]] turned on its head. In either event, [whether the outcome be state capitalism or state socialism] the result is the bureaucratization of the economic activities of the nation".&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini, Benito; "Address to the National Corporative Council (14 November 1933)". ''Fascism: Doctrine and Institutions''. Fertig, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini claimed that capitalism had degenerated in three stages, starting with dynamic or [[heroic capitalism]] (1830–1870), followed by static capitalism (1870–1914) and then reaching its final form of decadent capitalism, also known as [[Supercapitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|supercapitalism]] beginning in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Falasca-Zamponi, Simonetta. ''Fascist Spectacle: The Aesthetics of Power in Mussolini's Italy''. University of California Press, 2000. Pp. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mussolini denounced supercapitalism for causing the "standardization of humankind" and for causing excessive consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Falasca-Zamponi, Simonetta. ''Fascist Spectacle: The Aesthetics of Power in Mussolini's Italy''. University of California Press, 2000. Pp. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini claimed that at this stage of supercapitalism "[it] is then that a capitalist enterprise, when difficulties arise, throws itself like a dead weight into the state's arms. It is then that state intervention begins and becomes more necessary. It is then that those who once ignored the state now seek it out anxiously".&lt;ref name="Mussolini, Benito 1933 Pp. 158"&gt;Mussolini, Benito; Schnapp, Jeffery Thompson (ed.); Sears, Olivia E. (ed.); Stampino, Maria G. (ed.). "Address to the National Corporative Council (14 November 1933) and Senate Speech on the Bill Establishing the Corporations (abridged; 13 January 1934)". ''A Primer of Italian Fascism''. University of Nebraska Press, 2000. Pp. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the inability of businesses to operate properly when facing economic difficulties, Mussolini claimed that this proved that state intervention into the economy was necessary to stabilize the economy.&lt;ref name="Mussolini, Benito 1933 Pp. 158"/&gt;

Mussolini claimed that dynamic or heroic capitalism and the [[bourgeoisie]] could be prevented from degenerating into static capitalism and then supercapitalism only if the concept of economic [[individualism]] were abandoned and if state supervision of the economy was introduced.&lt;ref name="Salvemini. Pp. 134"&gt;Salvemini, Gaetano. Under the Axe of Fascism. READ BOOKS, 2006. Pp. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Private enterprise]] would control production, but it would be supervised by the state.&lt;ref name="Salvemini. Pp. 134"/&gt; Italian Fascism presented the economic system of [[corporatism]] as the solution that would preserve private enterprise and property while allowing the state to intervene in the economy when private enterprise failed.&lt;ref name="Salvemini. Pp. 134"/&gt;

==In Western countries==
An alternate definition is that state capitalism is a close relationship between the government and private capitalism, such as one in which the private capitalists produce for a guaranteed market. An example of this would be the [[military–industrial complex]] in which autonomous [[entrepreneurial]] firms produce for lucrative government contracts and are not subject to the discipline of competitive markets.  

Both the Trotskyist definition and this one derive from discussion among Marxists at the beginning of the 20th century, most notably [[Nikolai Bukharin]], who in his book ''Imperialism and the world economy'' thought that advanced, [[imperialist]] countries exhibited the latter definition and considered (and rejected) the possibility that they could arrive at the former.

State capitalism is practised by a variety of Western countries with respect to certain strategic resources important for [[national security]]. These may involve private investment as well. For example, a government may own or even monopolize oil production or transport infrastructure to ensure availability in the case of war. Examples include [[Neste]], [[Statoil]] and [[OMV]].

There are limits according to arguments that state capitalism exists to ensure that wealth creation does not threaten the ruling elite's political power, which remains unthreatened by tight connections between the government and the industries while state capitalist fears of capitalism's "creative destruction", of the threat of revolution and of any significant changes in the system result in the persistence of industries that have outlived their economic usefulness and an inefficient economic environment that is ill equipped to inspire innovation.

==In European studies==
Several European scholars and political economists have used the term to describe one of the three major varieties of capitalism that prevail in the modern context of the [[European Union]]. This approach is mainly influenced by Schmidt's (2002) article on ''The Futures of European Capitalism'', in which he divides modern European capitalism in three groups: "Market", "Managed" and "State". Here, state capitalism refers to a system where high coordination between the state, large companies and labour unions ensures economic growth and development in a quasi-[[corporatist]] model. The author cites France and to a lesser extent Italy as the prime examples of modern European state capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Wolff]] and [[Stephen Resnick]] identify state capitalism as the dominant class system throughout the history of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Resnick, Stephen &amp; Wolff, Richard (2002) Class Theory and History: Capitalism and Communism in the U.S.S.R. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==State monopoly capitalism==
The theory of [[state monopoly capitalism]] was initially a [[neo-Stalinist]] doctrine popularised after [[World War II]]. Lenin had claimed in 1916 that [[World War I]] had transformed ''laissez-faire'' capitalism into [[monopoly capitalism]], but he did not publish any extensive theory about the topic. The term refers to an environment where the state intervenes in the economy to protect large monopolistic or [[Oligopoly|oligopolistic]] businesses from competition by smaller firms.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought&lt;/ref&gt; The main principle of the ideology is that big business, having achieved a [[monopoly]] or [[cartel]] position in most markets of importance, fuses with the government apparatus. A kind of financial [[oligarchy]] or conglomerate therefore results, whereby government officials aim to provide the social and legal framework within which giant corporations can operate most effectively. This is a close partnership between big business and government and it is argued that the aim is to integrate labour-unions completely in that partnership.

State monopoly capitalist (stamocap) theory aims to define the final historical stage of capitalism following monopoly capitalism, consistent with Lenin's definition of the characteristics of imperialism in his short pamphlet of the same name. Occasionally the stamocap concept also appears in [[neo-Trotskyist]] theories of state capitalism as well as in [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] anti-state theories. The analysis made is usually identical in its main features, but very different political conclusions are drawn from it.

===Political implications===
{{quote|Ever since monopoly capital took over the world, it has kept the greater part of humanity in poverty, dividing all the profits among the group of the most powerful countries. The standard of living in those countries is based on the extreme poverty of our countries.| [[Che Guevara]], 1965&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/02/24.htm At the Afro-Asian Conference in Algeria] by Che Guevara, Delivered at the Second Economic Seminar of Afro-Asian Solidarity in Algiers, Algeria - on February 24, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The strategic political implication of stamocap theory towards the end of the [[Joseph Stalin]] era and afterwards was that the labour movement should form a "people's democratic alliance" under the leadership of the Communist Party with the progressive middle classes and small business against the state and big business (called "monopoly" for short). Sometimes this alliance was also called the "anti-monopoly alliance".

===Neo-Trotskyist theory===
In neo-Trotskyist theory, such an alliance was rejected as being based either on a false strategy of [[popular front]]s, or on political [[opportunism]], said to be incompatible either with a [[permanent revolution]] or with the principle of independent [[working class]] political action.

The [[State (polity)|state]] in Soviet-type societies was redefined by the neo-Trotskyists as being also state-monopoly capitalist. There was no difference between the West and the East in this regard. Consequently, some kind of anti-bureaucratic revolution was said to be required, but different Trotskyist groups quarreled about what form such a revolution would need to take, or could take.

Some Trotskyists believed the anti-bureaucratic revolution would happen spontaneously, inevitably and naturally, others believed it needed to be organised—the aim being to establish a society owned and operated by the working class. According to the neo-Trotskyists, the Communist Party could not play its leading role because it did not represent the interests of the working class.

===Criticism===
When Varga introduced the theory, orthodox Stalinist economists attacked it as incompatible with the doctrine that state planning was a feature only of socialism and that "under capitalism anarchy of production reigns".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/dunayevskaya/works/1949/varga.htm The Case of Eugene Varga] Raya Dunayevskaya 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the stamocap theory (e.g. [[Ernest Mandel]] and [[Leo Kofler]]) claimed the following:
* Stamocap theory wrongly implied that the state could somehow overrule inter-capitalist [[competition]], the laws of motion of capitalism and market forces generally, supposedly cancelling out the operation of the [[law of value]]. 
* Stamocap theory lacked any sophisticated account of the class basis of the [[State (polity)|state]] and the real linkages between governments and elites. It postulated a monolithic structure of [[wikt:domination|domination]] which in reality did not exist in that way.
* Stamocap theory failed to explain the rise of [[neo-liberal]] ideology in the business class, which claims precisely that an important social goal should be a reduction of the state's influence in the economy. 
* Stamocap theory failed to show clearly what the difference was between a socialist state and a bourgeois state, except that in a socialist state the Communist Party (or, rather, its central committee) played the leading political role. In that case, the class-content of the state itself was defined purely in terms of the policy of the ruling political party (or its central committee).

===In popular culture===
* ''[[WALL-E]]'' has the "Buy n' Large" corporation, which acted as the ''[[de facto]]'' and possibly ''[[de jure]]'' government in the decades before, and after, the evacuation of Earth.
* The Druuge, an alien race in ''[[Star Control]]'', are governed by the Crimson Corporation, which owns the Druuge home planet and everything on it. All Druuge are employees and/or shareholders of this corporation and Druuge who lose their jobs are immediately executed for stealing the planet's air, which the company owns, by breathing it.

==Current forms in the 21st century==
State capitalism is distinguished from capitalist [[mixed economies]] where the state [[State interventionism|intervenes]] in markets to correct market failures or to establish social regulation or social welfare provisions in the following way: the state operates [[business]]es for the purpose of accumulating capital and directing investment in the framework of either a free market or a mixed-market economy. In such a system, governmental functions and public services are often organized as [[corporation]]s, companies or business enterprises.

===China===
Many analysts assert that China is one of the main examples of state capitalism in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.forbes.com/greatspeculations/2010/03/22/communism-is-dead-but-state-capitalism-thrives/ Communism Is Dead, But State Capitalism Thrives], by Vahan Janjigian, forbes.com, Mar. 22 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.forbes.com/gadyepstein/2010/08/31/the-winners-and-losers-in-chinese-capitalism/ The Winners And Losers In Chinese Capitalism], by Gady Epstein, forbes.com, Aug. 31 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'' (2012). "State Capitalism: The Visible Hand". Special Report.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''[[The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations]]'', political scientist [[Ian Bremmer]] describes China as the primary driver for the rise of state capitalism as a challenge to the free market economies of the developed world, particularly in the aftermath of the [[2008 financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/439ccee0-bec6-11df-a755-00144feab49a,dwp_uuid=9bee261a-bec7-11df-a755-00144feab49a.html#axzz17YEJxrzO | title=State capitalism: China's 'market-Leninism' has yet to face biggest test | first=Geoff | last=Dyer | work=Financial Times | date=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bremmer draws a broad definition of state capitalism as such:&lt;ref name=Ferguson&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/02/09/we_re_all_state_capitalists_now | title=We're All State Capitalists Now | first=Niall | last=Ferguson |work=Foreign Policy |date=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation|In this system, governments use various kinds of state-owned companies to manage the exploitation of resources that they consider the state's crown jewels and to create and maintain large numbers of jobs. They use select privately owned companies to dominate certain economic sectors. They use so-called sovereign wealth funds to invest their extra cash in ways that maximize the state's profits. In all three cases, the state is using markets to create wealth that can be directed as political officials see fit. And in all three cases, the ultimate motive is not economic (maximizing growth) but political (maximizing the state's power and the leadership's chances of survival). This is a form of capitalism but one in which the state acts as the dominant economic player and uses markets primarily for political gain.}}

Following on Bremmer, Aligica and Tarko&lt;ref&gt;Aligica, Paul and Vlad Tarko (2012). "State Capitalism and the Rent-SeekingConjecture", ''Constitutional Political Economy ''23(4): 357-379&lt;/ref&gt; further develop the theory that state capitalism in countries like modern day China and Russia is an example of a [[rent-seeking]] society. They argue that following the realization that the centrally planned socialist systems could not effectively compete with capitalist economies, formerly Communist Party political elites are trying to engineer a limited form of economic liberalization that increases efficiency while still allowing them to maintain political control and power.

In his article "We're All State Capitalists Now", British historian and Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at [[Harvard University]] [[Niall Ferguson]] warns against "an unhelpful oversimplification to divide the world into 'market capitalist' and 'state capitalist' camps. The reality is that most countries are arranged along a spectrum where both the intent and the extent of state intervention in the economy vary".&lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt; He then notes:&lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt; {{quotation|The real contest of our time is not between a state-capitalist China and a market-capitalist America, with Europe somewhere in the middle. It is a contest that goes on within all three regions as we all struggle to strike the right balance between the economic institutions that generate wealth and the political institutions that regulate and redistribute it.}}

Analysis of the "[[Socialist market economy|Chinese model]]" by the economists Julan Du and Chenggang Xu finds that the contemporary [[Economy of China|economic system of the People's Republic of China]] represents a state capitalist system as opposed to a market socialist system. The reason for this categorization is the existence of [[financial market]]s in the Chinese economic system, which are absent in the market socialist literature and in the classic models of market socialism; and that state profits are retained by enterprises rather than being equitably distributed among the population in a [[basic income]]/[[social dividend]] or similar scheme, which are major features in the market socialist literature. They conclude that China is neither a form of market socialism nor a stable form of capitalism.&lt;ref name="Market Socialism or Capitalism?

Singapore's large holdings of government-linked companies and the state's close cooperation with business are defining aspects of [[Economy of Singapore|Singapore's economic model]].

===Taiwan===
Taiwan's economy has been classified as a state capitalist system influenced by its Leninist model of political control, a legacy which still lingers in the decision-making process. [[Taiwan's economy]] includes a number of state-owned enterprises, but the Taiwanese state's role in the economy shifted from that of an entrepreneur to a minority investor in companies alongside the democratization agenda of the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dittmer |first= Lowell |title= Taiwan and China: Fitful Embrace |publisher= University of California Press|year= 2017|isbn= 978-0520295988|page = 118|quote=A decade after Taiwan made its democratic transition, the KMT’s Leninist control model has yet to fade from the decision-making process. In short, both China’s and Taiwan’s state capitalism have their roots in the Leninist legacy...To be specific, Taiwan’s state capitalism has experienced a transformation from ‘leviathan as entrepreneur’ in the pre-1989 period to ‘leviathan as a minority investor’ with the agenda of democratization in the late 1980s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Taiwanese economists refer to Taiwan's economy model as "[[party-state capitalism]]".

'''Stericycle''' is a compliance company that specializes in collecting and disposing regulated substances, such as medical waste and sharps, pharmaceuticals, hazardous waste, and providing services for recalled and expired goods. It also provides related education and training services, and patient communication services. The company was founded in 1989 and is headquartered in [[Lake Forest, Illinois]], with many more bases of operation around the world, including toxic waste incinerators in Utah and North Carolina.

Stericycle has been harshly criticized by residents living near their incinerators and environmentalists across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redbag.com/images/documents/SSMStericycleReport.pdf] {{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Stericycle is being investigated by the state of Utah for burning hazardous, radioactive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=31602336|title=Whistleblower claims radioactive material incinerated at Stericycle |website=Ksl.com|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; waste above legal levels at their [[North Salt Lake, Utah|North Salt Lake]] location. The investigations also are in response to Stericycle's alleged falsification of records to hide the alleged illegal quantity burning near Foxboro Elementary in North Salt Lake.&lt;ref name="utah.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utah.gov/governor/news_media/article.html?article=10393|title=Story Details - Governor Gary Herbert|website=Utah.gov|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kuer.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuer.org/post/governor-orders-criminal-probe-alleged-misconduct-stericycle-incinerator|title=Governor Orders Criminal Probe Into Alleged Misconduct at Stericycle Incinerator|first=Andrea|last=Smardon|website=Kuer.org|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standard.net/Environment/2014/09/25/Governor-proesters-put-pressure-on-Stericycle] {{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stericycle, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, offers regulated waste management services, sharps disposal containers to reduce the risk of needlesticks, healthcare compliance services, pharmaceutical disposal, and regulated returns management services for expired or recalled products through incineration processes.

The company serves healthcare facilities such as [[hospitals]], [[blood banks]], [[pharmaceutical manufacturers]],. Stericycle also serves myriad small businesses, which include outpatient clinics, medical and dental offices, abortion clinics, veterinary and animal hospitals, [[funeral homes]], home healthcare agencies, body art studios, and long-term and sub-acute care facilities. Medical device manufacturers, consumer goods manufacturers, and retailers are also key customers.

==History==
Stericycle was founded in 1989 as a regulated medical waste company and became a publicly traded company in 1996. 

In 1999, it began offering safety and compliance training services with the launch of its Stericycle Steri-Safe OSHA Compliance program.

It acquired Bio Systems in 2003. Today, Stericycle Sharps Management Service with Bio Systems containers is the US leader in reusable sharps container management service.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}  The company’s pharmaceutical waste programs provide disposal of unused or expired wastes in hospitals, healthcare practices, and pharmacies.  To help hospitals manage their waste streams and drive recycling efforts, Stericycle began to offer Stericycle Integrated Waste Stream [[Solution]]s in 2009.

In 2010, Stericycle began to include patient notification services with the acquisition of NotifyMD. Several other acquisitions followed, giving Stericycle an interest in telephone support services for physician offices. 

In 2014, it acquired PSC Environmental Services LLC in a deal worth $275 million to form [http://www.stericycleenvironmental.com Stericycle Environmental Solutions].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140423/business/140429344/|title=Stericycle acquires PSC Environmental|first=Daily Herald News|last=Services|date=23 April 2014|website=Dailyherald.com|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled expansion in hazardous waste management.

In 2015, it acquired Shred-it International in a deal worth $2.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-15/stericycle-to-acquire-shred-it-international-for-2-3-billion|title=Stericycle to Buy Shred-It International for $2.3 Billion|website=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company’s international business began in 1997 with a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, Stericycle has created services, tools and resources for healthcare professionals not only in the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]], but also in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Ireland]], [[Japan]], [[Portugal]], Puerto Rico, [[Romania]], Spain, and the [[United Kingdom]].  

The company lost a contract to provide clinical waste services to GPs and pharmacies in [[Cumbria]] and north-east England in April 2017, when their competitor, [[Healthcare Environment Services]] put in a substantially cheaper offer, of £310,000, than theirs of £479,999. Stericycle then contrived a legal challenge against [[NHS England]]’s decision which was dismissed by the [[High Court of Justice]] in July 2018, and the company's behaviour severely criticised. Their commercial director Lindsay Dransfield was described as  “a broadly unsatisfactory witness”. The company said it intended to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stericycle sought to 'hurt NHS England' |url=https://www.mrw.co.uk/latest/stericycle-sought-to-hurt-nhs-england/10033751.article |accessdate=13 November 2018 |agency=Materials Recycling World |date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond services related to healthcare wastes, in some markets the company has expanded its offerings to include management of certain hazardous wastes as well as patient transport and medical courier services.

==Controversy==
Stericycle's medical waste incinerator located in North Salt Lake, Utah has been a topic of hot debate in the community. In September 2013, [[Erin Brockovich]] joined in with Utah residents in their call for Stericycle to discontinue their business in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/56933623-90/stericycle-salt-community-lake.html.csp|title=Erin Brockovich fires up Utah medical-waste incinerator foes|website=Sltrib.com|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksl.com/?sid=27046470|title=Erin Brockovich joins environmental activists in fight against Utah incinerator - KSL.com|website=Ksl.com|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brockovich's visit was spurred by a violation notice from the Utah Division of Air Quality to Stericycle for excessive emissions above legal limits, and manipulating their reporting to show lower amounts of Mercury, Dioxins, and other potentially harmful chemicals emitted through burning medical waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brockovich.com/portfolio/stericycle-utah/] {{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/utah-medical-waste-incinerator-stericycle-pollution_n_3909083.html | work=Huffington Post | title=A Toxic Technology? From Biological Hazards To Chemical Dangers | date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The violations in 2013 were followed by criminal investigations at the order of Utah Governor [[Gary Herbert]].&lt;ref name="utah.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kuer.org"/&gt; 
Investigations by California's Soil Water Air Protection Enterprise, or SWAPE, in connection with Ms. Brockovich, discovered [[Dioxin]] in homes near the incinerator at levels 16x higher than what is considered "safe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://e.standard.net/stories/2014/03/15/dangerous-levels-dioxin-found-stericycle-neighborhood-homes] {{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christophergauthier.com/galleries/the-new-downwinders-2/|title=The New Downwinders - Christopher M. Gauthiér|website=Christophergauthier.com|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 1, 2014, Stericycle and the Utah Division of Air Quality reached an agreement acknowledging no wrongdoing, though the settlement does require Stericycle to relocate approximately 40 miles to the west of the incinerator's current location in North Salt Lake. The settlement also calls for Stericycle to pay a $2.3 million fine, half of which is forgivable if the move happens within 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox13now.com/2014/12/01/stericycle-reaches-settlement-with-state-clean-air-advocates-object/|title=Stericycle reaches settlement with state; clean air advocates object|date=2 December 2014|website=Fox13now.com|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865616764/Proposed-Stericycle-settlement-calls-for-23-million-fine-move-to-Tooele-County.html?pg=all|title=Proposed Stericycle settlement calls for $2.3 million fine, move to Tooele County|first=Amy Joi|last=O'Donoghue|date=1 December 2014|website=Deseretnews.com|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2017, a  $295 million settlement was reached on behalf of a nationwide class of Stericycle customers, following a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of engaging in a price-increasing scheme that automatically inflated customers' bills up to 18 percent biannually, according to a news release from Hagens Berman, the Chicago-based law firm that represented the class.

'''Uthapuram''' is a village in [[Madurai district]], [[Tamil Nadu]], India. It is known for a wall which segregated [[Dalit]]s from the village for two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7404062.stm | title=The walls still keeping untouchables out | work=BBC News | date=19 May 2008 | accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uthapuram wall ==
The village have two major communities, one is dominant caste Hindu [[Pillai (surname)|Pillai]] another one is scheduled caste [[Dalit]] [[Pallar]] community.&lt;ref name="accord"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2823/stories/20111118282312100.htm |title=Accord in Uthapuram |publisher=Front line}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Caste-related violence in India|caste violence]] occurred occasionally between these communities. The violence happened in 1948, 1964 and 1989. After 1989 violence caste Hindus constructed a 30 meter long wall to segregate Dalits from the village. The wall later described as "wall of [[untouchability]]". The Dalits were not allowed to enter the streets of caste Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/Electrified-wall-divides-people-on-caste-lines/article15205203.ece |title=Electrified wall divides people on caste lines |publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, [[Tamil Nadu Untouchability Eradication Front]] (TNUEF) of [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] and Dalit organizations protested against the construction of the wall.&lt;ref name="accord" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2511/stories/20080606251112300.htm |title=The fall of a wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caste Hindus argued that the wall was built on the private land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7386601.stm |title='Caste wall' is partly demolished}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, Madurai district administration demolished the wall and allowed the Dalits into the village. After demolition, violence occurred between the communities. The caste Hindus threatened that they would leave the village. To control the situation police opened fire in that one person died. The cases were filed against the incident. In 2012, [[Madras High Court]] ordered compensation to the people who suffered during the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/uthapuram-wall-is-no-berlin-wall/article3024288.ece |title="Uthapuram wall is no Berlin wall" |publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="will"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2909/stories/20120518290904200.htm |title=Wall vs will |publisher=Front line}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/G.O.-issued-for-paying-Rs.1.14-crore-as-compensation-to-Uthapuram-Dalits/article14020886.ece |title=G.O. issued for paying Rs.1.14 crore as compensation to Uthapuram Dalits |publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mansell and Senna at Silverstone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nigel Mansell]] gives [[Ayrton Senna]] a lift back to the pits on his victory lap after winning the [[1991 British Grand Prix]].]]
[[File:2015 Punta del Este ePrix - Videos - Victory lap.webm|thumb|Victory lap at the 2015 Punta del Este ePrix]]

A '''victory lap''' (also '''lap of honor''') is a term used in [[motorsports]] to describe an extra lap of the [[race track]] after the conclusion of a [[Racing|race]]. This lap, driven at reduced speed, allows the winning driver to celebrate their victory and gives the spectators an opportunity to congratulate and honor the competitors. Commonly, trackside flag [[marshals]] will wave their [[racing flags|flags]] in a gesture known as the '''[[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] salute''' or the ''Monkey Dance'' in the US.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} It is not uncommon for marshals to clap or wave their hands at drivers as a gesture and sometimes the drivers wave back in response.

Victory laps can sometime become dangerous for the winner and the other drivers, since in many tracks the safety nets can be easily climbed over by the crowd, which then becomes an obstacle for the racers.

Victory laps have regularly seen drivers who have retired in the final stages of a race being given a lift back to the pits on one of their competitors' cars.  Some notable examples in [[Formula One]] include [[Riccardo Patrese]] and [[Didier Pironi]] at the [[1982 Monaco Grand Prix]], [[Nigel Mansell]] and [[Ayrton Senna]] at the [[1991 British Grand Prix]] (pictured), [[Jean Alesi]] and [[Michael Schumacher]] at the [[1995 Canadian Grand Prix]], Michael Schumacher and [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] at the [[1997 German Grand Prix]], [[Mika Häkkinen]] and [[David Coulthard]] at the [[2001 Spanish Grand Prix]], and [[Mark Webber]] and [[Fernando Alonso]] at the [[2011 German Grand Prix]] and [[2013 Singapore Grand Prix]]

Recently the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]], motor sport's world governing body, have restricted what a Formula One driver may do on his victory lap. The sporting regulations state that at the end of a race, "all cars must proceed on the circuit directly to the post race parc fermé without stopping, without overtaking (unless clearly necessary), without receiving any object whatsoever and without any assistance (except that of the marshals if necessary)."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.fia.com/resources/documents/548514743__2006_F1_SPORTING_REGULATIONS.pdf FIA Sporting Regulations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408104015/http://www.fia.com/resources/documents/548514743__2006_F1_SPORTING_REGULATIONS.pdf |date=April 8, 2006 }}'' FIA.com.

==Polish victory lap==
[[Image:PolishVictoryLapIceRacing.jpg|thumb|right|A winning [[ice racing]] driver taking a Polish Victory Lap on a frozen [[Wisconsin]] lake]]
A '''Polish''', or '''Kulwicki victory lap''' entails the driver turning his car around and driving in the opposite direction, which is clockwise on [[NASCAR]] ovals.  It has been used in road courses.

This style of victory lap is common in local short track or dirt track races, where the victorious driver takes the [[Racing flag#The checkered flag|checkered flag]] from the flag stand, and then proceeds to drive with the driver's side of the car facing the fans for their victory lap.

The term was first [[neologism|coined]] as a result of [[Polish American]] [[Alan Kulwicki]]'s celebration of his first career [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup]] victory at the [[Checker Auto Parts 500|Checker 500]] ([[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]]) on November 6, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/videos/2013/11/7/sprint-cup-series-memorable-moments-phoenix.html|title=Memorable Moments: Phoenix|work=[[NASCAR]]|date=November 7, 2013|accessdate=November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He celebrated his victory by driving a clockwise victory lap. A [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] engineer slapped him on the back and asked if that was a "Polish" victory lap. Kulwicki's only other Polish Victory lap came in [[1992 in NASCAR|1992]], in celebration of his Winston Cup Championship at the [[1992 Hooters 500]].

The term was solidified after Kulwicki's death. Kulwicki died in a plane crash on Thursday, April 1, 1993, near [[Blountville, Tennessee]]. Hours after Kulwicki's death, Peter Jellen drove Kulwicki’s racecar hauler counter-clockwise around [[Bristol Motor Speedway]] before leaving the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.speedtv.com/articles/nascar/nextel/33878/?page=4 |pages=4 |title=CUP: A Tribute to Alan Kulwicki |accessdate=2007-07-09 |date=November 10, 2006 |publisher=[[Speed Channel]].com |author=Tom Jensen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after Kulwicki's death, [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]] [[Nationwide Series|Busch Series]] race winner [[Michael Waltrip]] honored his old short track foe by turning Kulwicki's trademark reverse Polish Victory Lap, but only half a lap, stating that he didn't want to do Kulwicki's entire routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underbird.com/news/toofast.htm|title=Sports|work=underbird.com|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Winston Cup winner [[Rusty Wallace]] followed Waltrip's lead,&lt;ref&gt;[https://sports.yahoo.com/nascar/news?slug=jb-rustybristol082605&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns Rusty's last bash]; Jerry Bonkowski; [[Yahoo!]], August 25, 2005, Retrieved March 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and proceeded to run a full Polish Victory Lap, both after that race, and after each victory for the rest of the 1993 season.  Tom Roberts, Wallace's and sponsor Miller Brewing's publicist, was also Kulwicki's publicist.  In addition, most winners for the remainder of the [[1993 in NASCAR|1993 season]] honored Kulwicki with a Polish victory lap. On November 14, 1993, after the [[Labor Day Classic 500|Hooters 500]] ([[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]]), the last race of that season, the race winner Wallace and 1993 series champion [[Dale Earnhardt]] ran a Polish Victory Lap together while carrying #7 and #28 flags commemorating Kulwicki and [[Davey Allison]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underbird.com/news/inmemory.htm|title=SpeedwayMedia.com, In Memory of Alan--Ten Years Gone (Revisited)|work=underbird.com|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Joy]] frequently refers to this as an "Alan Kulwicki victory lap" in memory of the driver, and noted the spectators see the driver, who usually waves and sometimes has his helmet off, as he salutes the fans.   Joy's term is reminiscent of other cases where a term is named for the person who developed the idea (i. e., [[Gurney flap]], Petty bar).  The term "Polish victory lap" is considered by some{{who|date=January 2016}} as [[political correctness|politically incorrect]], referring to [[Polish jokes]].

[[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] did a Polish victory lap after winning the [[2001 MBNA Cal Ripken, Jr. 400]] at [[Dover International Speedway|Dover Downs International Speedway]] in the first NASCAR Winston Cup Race following the [[September 11 attacks]] while holding a large American flag out the driver's side window.

[[Kurt Busch]] celebrated his 2005 win at Phoenix with a Polish victory lap. Busch watched his first NASCAR races at the track, and wanted to honor Kulwicki.  [[Kyle Busch]] also did a Polish Victory Lap after his 2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup win at Bristol.

Many local racetrack winners and series champions have saluted Kulwicki or his underdog spirit with a Polish victory lap, especially in his home state of [[Wisconsin]]. 2006 [[Milwaukee Mile|Milwaukee]] (Wisconsin) race winner [[Paul Menard]] (a Wisconsinite) celebrated his first Busch Series win with a Polish Victory lap.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070312031735/http://www.motorsporttoday.com/2006-Busch-Milwaukee-Review.html Paul Menard captures first career Busch Series victory in Milwaukee]; Motorsport Today&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt Busch, with his win at Atlanta in Sprint Cup, 2009, ended up putting the car in reverse and driving it around the track backwards. His brother Kyle also used this after his win in Bristol. The practice was later dubbed, "The Unwind Lap".

In 2012, [[Tony Stewart]] did a Polish victory lap after finally winning for the first time at Las Vegas Motor Speedway in the Kobalt Tools 400.

In 2014, Earnhardt, Jr. celebrated his Daytona 500 victory with a Polish victory lap.  His second win of the 2014 season came on June 8 at Pocono, where he repeated it. He also performed the feat after winning the [[2014 Goody's Headache Relief Shot 500|Goody's Headache Relief Shot 500]] in October.

In 2014, [[Denny Hamlin]] celebrated his [[Nationwide Series]] in his home state track at [[Richmond International Raceway]] with a Polish Victory Lap, and completing it while performing a burnout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kVA4JhoF-k|title=Hamlin delivers a win in home state|date=24 April 2015|work=YouTube|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
The '''women in Northern Cyprus''' are inhabitants of the internationally unrecognised [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], where they have been contributors to the fields of science, law and justice.&lt;ref name=Cypnet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cypnet.co.uk/ncyprus/people/women/sayiner-g.html|title=Turkish-Cypriot Women: Dr Gülin Sayiner|author=|date=|website=www.cypnet.co.uk|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231152/http://www.cypnet.co.uk/ncyprus/people/women/sayiner-g.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several factors have inhibited women's participation in politics, and women constitute only 8% of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Northern Cyprus)|Assembly of the Republic]]. In 2013, [[Sibel Siber]] became the first female prime minister of Northern Cyprus.

Northern Cyprus has no active women's shelters. In 2014, the parliament unanimously voted to establish a department promoting gender equality, which is establishing institutions for women's welfare.

== Societal attitudes ==
A survey of 600 women in 2010 for the Association for Support for Life from Women (KAYAD) indicated that 51% of women agreed that women had to conform to pre-determined gender roles, 88% agreed that above all else, women should be good mothers and caretakers of the home, 58% believed that women should be home before their husbands and 80% believed that girls should be raised to become "ladies", 20% believed that widowed or divorced women should not live alone. 40% stated that they had difficulties in achieving their goals due to societal pressure, while 38% believed that it was not as important for women to have a significant role in public life in comparison to men. 55% believed that women should be able to work outside the family even if not necessitated by economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kıbrıs’ın Kuzey Kesimindeki Kadınların Profili|url=http://kayadcommunitycenter.com/KadinProfili.pdf|publisher=KAYAD|accessdate=10 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914030159/http://kayadcommunitycenter.com/KadinProfili.pdf|archivedate=14 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics ==
Constraints affecting women who have entered politics in Northern Cyprus include investing time for home, motherhood, family, and political life. The fact that [[coffeehouse]]s and [[meyhane]] (traditional drinking taverns), social spaces that have been traditionally reserved for men, remain central to Turkish Cypriot politics is a restraining factor for women. Even some regional headquarters of political parties function as coffeehouses.&lt;ref name=Index&gt;Yirmibeolu, Gözde.

===Female politicians===
As of 2010, there were only 7 female Northern Cypriots who held high-level positions in the [[Parliament of Northern Cyprus]].&lt;ref name=Index/&gt; The posts that the women occupied included parliamentarian and ministerial jobs, such as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the appointed Minister of Education. [[Fatma Ekenoğlu]] was the Speaker of the House of Representatives. [[Onur Borman]] was the Minister of the Ministry of Economy and Finance and was also the Minister of the Ministry of Public Works between 1993 and 1999. [[Gülsen Bozkurt]] was the former Minister of the Ministry of Health. [[Gülin Sayıner]] was one of the first two elected female members of the Parliament of Northern Cyprus (Republican Assembly) and served from 1987 to 1993.&lt;ref name=Cypnet/&gt; [[Şerife Ünverdi]] used to be the Minister of Labor and Social Security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brtk.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=26807:messages-have-been-issued-by-president-dervis-eroglu-prime-minister-irsen-kucuk-and-minister-of-labor-and-social-security-serife-unverdi&amp;catid=5:kktc&amp;Itemid=28 MESSAGES HAVE BEEN ISSUED BY PRESIDENT DERVIS EROGLU, PRIME MINISTER IRSEN KUCUK AND MINISTER OF LABOR AND SOCIAL SECURITY SERIFE UNVERDI] ([[Bayrak|BRT]]) Retrieved 2010-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt; These women were able to reach out to voters of Northern Cyprus because of their medical backgrounds.&lt;ref name=Index/&gt;&lt;ref name=Deep/&gt; In 2013, [[Sibel Siber]] became the first female prime minister of Northern Cyprus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Default.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nid=48659 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019095831/http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Default.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nid=48659 |archivedate=2014-10-19 |df= }} Turkish Cyprus to see first female prime minister, Hürriyet Daily News, 12 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and is running for president from the ruling [[Republican Turkish Party]] (CTP) in the [[Northern Cyprus presidential election, 2015|2015]] presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CTP'NİN CUMHURBAŞKANI ADAYI SİBER|url=http://www.yeniduzen.com/Haberler/siyaset/ctpnin-cumhurbaskani-adayi-siber/42349|publisher=[[Yeni Düzen]]|accessdate=15 February 2015|language=Turkish|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215171849/http://www.yeniduzen.com/Haberler/siyaset/ctpnin-cumhurbaskani-adayi-siber/42349|archivedate=15 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, women constitute only 8% of the parliament as of 2015. Only 4 out of 47 female candidates were elected in the [[Northern Cyprus parliamentary election, 2013|2013 parliamentary election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kadın milletvekilleri yine azınlıkta!|url=http://www.kibrispostasi.com/index.php/cat/35/news/111243|publisher=Kıbrıs Postası|accessdate=15 February 2015|language=Turkish|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215185816/http://www.kibrispostasi.com/index.php/cat/35/news/111243|archivedate=15 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 29, 1980, [[Gönül Başaran Erönen]] became the first female Justice of Northern Cyprus. She was also appointed as the first female District Court Judge in Cyprus. At present, she is the only female justice of the Supreme Court on the whole island of Cyprus.&lt;ref name=Eronen&gt;[http://www.cypnet.co.uk/ncyprus/people/women/eronen.html Gönül Başaran Erönen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014204443/http://cypnet.co.uk/ncyprus/people/women/eronen.html |date=2010-10-14 }}, First woman Justice of the T.R. of Northern Cyprus], Turkish-Cypriot Women, People &amp; Life, cypnet.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a new Political Parties Law brought a quota requiring that at least 30% of candidates for member of parliament are selected from each sex by each party. Any party that does not fulfill this requirement may not participate in elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barajı geçememesine karşın en az yüzde 3 oy alan partiler devlet yardımı alabilecek|url=http://www.kibrispostasi.com/index.php/cat/35/news/174662/PageName/KIBRIS_HABERLERI|publisher=Kıbrıs Postası|accessdate=26 October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027143256/http://www.kibrispostasi.com/index.php/cat/35/news/174662/PageName/KIBRIS_HABERLERI|archivedate=27 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Violence against women ==
In 2014, 204 women filed complaints to the police reporting violence against them. [[Aziz Gürpınar]], the Minister of Labour and Social Security at the time, called the figure "frightening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kadınlar şiddet kurbanı|url=http://www.kibrisgazetesi.com/?p=728246|publisher=Kıbrıs|accessdate=10 July 2016|date=23 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820175706/http://www.kibrisgazetesi.com/?p=728246|archivedate=20 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2013 and 2015, the number of complaints was 442 in total, and according to [[Asım Akansoy]], Minister of the Interior at the time, only 10% of victims were estimated to have reported violence. Northern Cyprus ratified the [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=İçişleri Bakanı'ndan 'Kadına Şiddet' Raporu|url=http://haberkibris.com/icisleri-bakanindan-kadina--siddet-raporu-2016-02-16.html|publisher=Haber Kıbrıs|accessdate=10 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820015431/http://haberkibris.com/icisleri-bakanindan-kadina--siddet-raporu-2016-02-16.html|archivedate=20 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of 1000 married women in 2012 by the non-governmental organization Feminist Workshop found that 33% of married women experienced violence, while the participants reported knowing on average 2.58 women who experienced violence from their partners. 14% of women reported having experienced [[marital rape]].&lt;ref name="femasurvey"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kıbrıs’ın Kuzeyinde Aile İçi Şiddet|url=http://www.yeniduzen.com/Ekler/gaile/241/kibris-in-kuzeyinde-aile-ici-siddet/916|publisher=Yeni Düzen|accessdate=10 July 2016|date=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the lack of a reliable public transport system, students in Northern Cyprus sometimes have to hitchhike. Students have reported that female students often face sexual harassment in these hikes, while male students also reported harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KKTC’de kadın ve erkek öğrenciler tacize uğruyor!|url=http://www.kibrisadahaber.com/kktcde-kadin-ve-erkek-ogrenciler-tacize-ugruyor.html|publisher=Kıbrıs Ada Haber|accessdate=10 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815230859/http://www.kibrisadahaber.com/kktcde-kadin-ve-erkek-ogrenciler-tacize-ugruyor.html|archivedate=15 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employment ==
According to a 2015 survey by the State Planning Organization, 39-40% of women participated in the workforce as opposed to 71-72% of men. Female unemployment rate was found to be 8.9%, as opposed to 6.5% for men, and 36.5% of all employees were women.

The Plan for the Support of Local Employment, whose implementation started in 2013, prioritised the increase of women's participation in the workforce. The plan resulted in the employment of 2091 women along with 1812 men until January 2015. The plan also allowed 78 women to start businesses in 39 sectors. These women owned their own businesses for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kadınların işgücüne katılımı konusunda atılan adımlar meyve vermeye başladı|url=http://www.kibrispostasi.com/index.php/cat/35/news/154060/PageName/KIBRIS_HABERLERI|publisher=Kıbrıs Postası|accessdate=10 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728001630/http://www.kibrispostasi.com/index.php/cat/35/news/154060/PageName/KIBRIS_HABERLERI|archivedate=28 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in Syria''' constitute 49.4% of Syria's population,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://countrymeters.info/en/Syria|title = Syria Population|last = |first = |date = 7 Apr 2015|journal = Syria Population|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are active participants not only in everyday life, but also in the socio-political fields. The [[Syrian Civil War]] put a new obstacle on Syrian women, forcing them to face increasing levels of violence, including [[war rape]], and traditional abusive practices such as [[honor killings]] which occur in rural areas and areas held by extremist terrorists.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

== History ==
In the 20th century a movement for [[women's rights]] developed in Syria, made up largely of upper-class, educated women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=edited by Bonnie G.|title=Women's history in global perspective|year=2005|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana, Ill.|isbn=9780252029905|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, [[Naziq al-Abid]] founded Noor al-Fayha (Light of Damascus), the city's first women's organization, alongside an affiliated publication of the same name. She was made an honorary general of the [[Syrian Army]] after fighting in the [[Battle of Maysaloun]], and in 1922 she founded the [[Syrian Red Crescent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syrian Women Making Change|url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/thelightinhereyes/syrian-women-making-change-past-and-present.php|accessdate=15 March 2013|publisher=PBS|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 Lebanese-Syrian feminist [[Nazira Zain al-Din]], one of the first people to critically reinterpret the [[Quran]] from a feminist perspective, published a book condemning the practice of veiling or [[hijab]], arguing that [[Islam]] requires women to be treated equally with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keddie|first=Nikki R.|title=Women in the Middle East: past and present|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=9780691128634|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 the [[Ba'th Party]] took power in Syria, and pledged full equality between women and men as well as full workforce participation for women.&lt;ref name="Tohidi 1998 103"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tohidi|first=ed. by Herbert L. Bodman, Nayereh|title=Women in muslim societies: diversity within unity|year=1998|publisher=L. Rienner|location=Boulder (Colo.)|isbn=9781555875787|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 Syrian women formed a quasi-governmental organization called the [[General Union of Syrian Women]] (GUSW), a coalition of women's welfare societies, educational associations, and voluntary councils intended to achieve equal opportunity for women in Syria.&lt;ref name="Tohidi 1998 103"/&gt;

The year 2011 marked the beginning of the conflict throughout Syria where many innocent civilians fell victims to the war perpetuated by the freedom fighters, who targeted hospitals, schools and the country’s infrastructure. And in rebel held areas, women were particularly targeted due to them being perceived as weak and lesser than men.  

The Syrian women in conflict areas were terrorized and forced into hiding to avoid being caught and raped by the men fighting for ISIS/ISIL or the freedom fighters. Women and children were also forced to appear in videos serving the propaganda against the Syrian government and the army, in many cases under the threat of violence. In cases where women were pro-ISIS, pro-Rebels, they were active in the terrorist acts committed against innocent Syrian civilians by blowing themselves up near primary schools, causing the death of young children, and hospitals in order to destroy public access to healthcare. 

Some were active participants in “Jihad al-Nikah” &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_jihad&lt;/ref&gt;where they served as nothing more than bodies used for sex, traded between the so-called freedom fighters, with many falling pregnant and bearing children into the war serving as nothing more than tools in the propaganda against Bashar Al-Assad’s government. And despite the numerous claims of the MSM; throughout the entire country, many Syrian women are pro-government and pro-Bashar Al-Assad and vehement supporters of the Syrian Arab Army. 

In response to the violence conducted by the terrorists against them, many ordinary Syrian women joined the all-female brigade unit that is part of the constitutional army of the Syrian Arab Republic and joined the fight against the ISIL/ISIS terrorists; where some took the roles of snipers to avoid direct-combat areas and others actively fought on the frontlines, side by side with their male counterparts in the army. &lt;ref&gt;https://arabic.sputniknews.com/arab_world/201610171020473107-نساء-تقاتل-بجانب-الجيش-السوري/&lt;/ref&gt;

They are applauded for their bravery and dedication to the homeland by the Syrian populace, echoing the bravery of the women in Syria throughout its long, ancient history.

== Legal rights ==
While Syria has developed some fairly secular features during independence in the second half of the 20th century, [[personal status]] law is still based on [[Sharia]]&lt;ref name=Sharia1&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/Syria_APS.doc|publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|page=13|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and applied by Sharia Courts.&lt;ref name=Sharia2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/islamic-family-law/home/research/legal-profiles/syria-syrian-arab-republic/|title=Islamic Family Law: Syria (Syrian Arab Republic)|publisher=Law.emory.edu|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syria has a dual legal system which includes both secular and religious courts, and the latter discriminate against women.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Syria-Gender-Eqaulity-Profile-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marriage contracts]] are between the groom and the bride's father, and Syrian law does not recognize the concept of [[marital rape]].&lt;ref name="Syria Capabilities Approach"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Charles|first=Lorraine|author2=Kate Denman |title="Every knot has someone to undo it." Using the Capabilities Approach as a lens to view the status of women leading up to the Arab Spring in Syria|journal=Journal of International Women's Studies|date=October 2012|volume=13|issue=5|pages=195–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syrian women are legally allowed to participate in everyday life, although they are not guaranteed a spot in being part of political, social, cultural and economic categories. The legal marriage for females in Syria is seventeen years old and eighteen for males. Early marriage is not out of the ordinary in their culture. Even though the legal age is seventeen, the courts can allow for girls as young as thirteen to be married. Women are technically allowed to have a say in what the agreements are between them and the groom. Although, since this contract has to be signed by the groom and the male guardian of the bride, her wishes are rarely met. On the other hand, of marriage, the divorce laws are unique in Syria. Women are in fact allowed to file for divorce except it is a long drawn out process and she must get consent from her husband. There are some circumstances in which the woman can apply for a divorce through the judicial system. In order to do this, she must prove that her husband has abused her or neglected his other duties as a husband. If a man wants to divorce a woman, all he has to do is go to court and orally demand a divorce three times, then the court will order him a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Legal rights - Syria {{!}} Kvinfo.dk|url = http://kvinfo.org/mena/legal-rights-syria-0|website = kvinfo.org|accessdate = 2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

The early schooling in Syria starts at six years old and ends at the age of eighteen. In Syrian universities, women and men attend the same classes. Between 1970 and the late 1990s, the female population in schools dramatically increased. This increase included the early school years, along with the upper level schools such as universities. Although the number of women has increased, there are still ninety five women to every one hundred men. Although many women start going to school, the dropout rate for women is much higher than for men.

The literacy rate for women is 74.2 percent and 91 percent for men. The rate of females over 25 with secondary education is 29.0 percent.&lt;ref name=gii/&gt;

== Politics ==

In 1949, women in Syria were first allowed to vote and received universal suffrage in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pamela|first=Paxton|title=Women, Politics, and Power: A Global Perspective|year=2007|publisher=Pine Forge Press|location=Thousand Oaks, California|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, [[Thuraya Al-Hafez]] ran for [[People's Council of Syria|Parliament]], but was not elected. By 1971, women held four out of the 173 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moubayed|first=Sami|title=A History of Syrian Women|url=http://onfaith.washingtonpost.com/postglobal/needtoknow/2006/12/a_history_of_syrian_women.html|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current president of Syria is a male. There are also two vice presidents (including female vice president [[Najah al-Attar]] since 2006), a prime minister and a cabinet. As of 2012, in the national parliament men held 88% of the seats while women held 12%.&lt;ref name="Syrian Arab Republic"/&gt; The [[People's Council of Syria|Syrian Parliament]] was previously led by female [[Speaker of the People's Council of Syria|Speaker]] [[Hadiya Khalaf Abbas]], the first woman to have held that position.&lt;ref name=SANA&gt;{{cite news |title=250 New Parliament Members Take Constitutional Oath |author= |url=http://syriatimes.sy/index.php/news/local/24397-250-new-parliament-members-take-constitutional-oath |publisher=[[Syria Times]] |date=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Assad's political and media adviser is [[Bouthaina Shaaban]]. Shaaban served as the first [[Ministry of Expatriates (Syria)|Minister of Expatriates]] for the [[Syrian Arab Republic]], between 2003 and 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dreams and Shadows: the Future of the Middle East |last=Wright |first=Robin B.|authorlink=Robin Wright (author) |year=2008 |publisher=Penguin Group |location= |isbn=978-1-59420-111-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nzXA7PZdO0AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Dreams+and+Shadows+:+the+Future+of+the+Middle+East&amp;ei=trTBS5CyMqaukAS39ITOCQ&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she has been described as the Syrian government's face to the outside world.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

== Role in economy and in the military ==

In 1989 the Syrian government passed a law requiring factories and public institutions to provide on-site childcare.&lt;ref name="Tohidi 1998 103"/&gt;

However, women's involvement in the workforce is low; according to [[World Bank]], as of 2014, women made up 15.5% of the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are not conscripted in the military, but may serve voluntarily. The female militias of Syria are trained to fight for the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. A video was found dating back to the 1980s with female soldiers showing their pride and protectiveness toward Assad's father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The all-female militias of Syria|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/01/25/the-all-female-militias-of-syria/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2013-01-25|access-date = 2015-04-21|issn = 0190-8286|first = Liz|last = Sly|first2 = Ahmed|last2 = Ramadan}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Because women are rarely involved in the armed side of the revolution, they are much less likely to get stopped, searched, or hassled at government checkpoints. This has proved crucial in distributing humanitarian aid throughout Syria."&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/syria/2013-03-06/how-syrian-women-are-fueling-resistance|title=How Syrian Women Are Fueling the Resistance|date=2013-03-07|website=Foreign Affairs|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's health ==

Between 2010 and 2015, the average life expectancy at birth for women in Syria is 77.7 years, compared with 74.5 years for men.&lt;ref name="Syrian Arab Republic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Syrian Arab Republic|url=http://data.un.org/CountryProfile.aspx?crName=Syrian+Arab+Republic|publisher=United Nations Statistics Division|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime against women ==
===Honor killings===
[[Honor killings]] take place in Syria in situations where women are deemed to have brought shame to the family, affecting the family's 'reputation' in the community. Some estimates suggest that more than 200 honor killings occur every year in [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7042249.stm | work=BBC News | first=Lina | last=Sinjab | title=Honour crime fear of Syria women | date=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forced and child marriage===
The conflict in Syria has led to an increase in child marriages.. The harsh living conditions, the insecurity, and the fear of rape, have led families to force their daughters into early marriages.&lt;ref&gt;https://europa.eu/eyd2015/en/unfpa/stories/child-marriage-takes-toll-syrian-girls&lt;/ref&gt;

=== '''Domestic Violence''' ===
Physical abuse (battering at least 3 times in the last year) was found in 23% of the investigated women in 2003, 26% amongst married women. Regular abuse (battering at least once weekly) was found in 3.3% of married women, with no regular abused reported by non-married women. The prevalence of physical abuse amongst country residents was 44.3% compared to 18.8% amongst country residents. In most cases (87.4%) the abuse was inflected by the husband, and in 9.5% of cases, the abuse was inflicted by more than one person. Correlates of physical abuse was women's education, religion, age, marital status, economic status, mental distress, smoking and residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maziak|first=Wasim|last2=Asfar|first2=Taghrid|date=2003-04|title=PHYSICAL ABUSE IN LOW-INCOME WOMEN IN ALEPPO, SYRIA|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07399330390191689|journal=Health Care for Women International|language=en|volume=24|issue=4|pages=313–326|doi=10.1080/07399330390191689|issn=0739-9332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Federation of Northern Syria - Rojava ==
{{Further information|Rojava|Jineology|Kongreya Star}}

[[File:Kurdish female fighter.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|Member of the YPJ with a standard uniform]]

With the [[Syrian Civil War]], the Kurdish populated area in Northern Syria has gained de facto autonomy as the [[Rojava|Federation of Northern Syria - Rojava]], with the leading political actor being the progressive [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)|Democratic Union Party]] (PYD). Kurdish women have several armed and non-armed organizations in Rojava, and enhancing women's rights is a major focus of the political and societal agenda. Kurdish female fighters in the [[Women's Protection Units]] (YPJ) played a key role during the [[Siege of Kobani]] and in rescuing [[Yazidis]] trapped on [[Mount Sinjar]], and their achievements have attracted international attention as a rare example of strong female achievement in a region in which women are heavily repressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rudaw.net/english/middleeast/05032015|title=Female Kurdish fighters battling ISIS win Israeli hearts|work=Rudaw|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctQFgDabh1U|title=The Fight Against ISIS in Syria And Iraq December 2014 by Itai Anghel|date=22 December 2014|work=The Israeli Network via YouTube|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tin.tv/site/show/cat2/fact-2012-uvda|title=Fact 2015 (Uvda) – Israel’s leading investigative show|date=22 December 2014|work=The Israeli Network|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rudaw.net/english/world/26122014|title=Kurdish female fighters named ‘most inspiring women’ of 2014|work=Rudaw|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/kobani-how-sacrifice-local-knowledge-heroism-kurdish-female-fighters-beat-isis-1487358|title=Kobani: How strategy, sacrifice and heroism of Kurdish female fighters beat Isis|work=International Business Times UK|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil laws of Syria are valid in Rojava, as far as they do not conflict with the Constitution of Rojava. One notable example for amendment is personal status law, in Syria still Sharia-based,&lt;ref name=Sharia1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharia2/&gt; where Rojava introduced civil law and proclaims absolute equality of women under the law and a ban on [[forced marriage]] as well as [[polygamy]] was introduced,&lt;ref name=jolie&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37337908|title=Kurdish 'Angelina Jolie' devalued by media hype|work=BBC|date=2016-09-12|accessdate=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; while underage marriage was outlawed as well.&lt;ref name=underage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2016/11/syrian-kurds-tackle-underage-marriages-polygamy/|title=Syrian Kurds tackle conscription, underage marriages and polygamy|work=ARA News|date=15 November 2016|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in Syrian history, [[civil marriage]] is being allowed and promoted, a significant move towards a secular open society and intermarriage between people of different religious backgrounds.&lt;ref name=marriage&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria Kurds challenging traditions, promote civil marriage|url=http://aranews.net/2016/02/syria-kurds-challenging-traditions-promote-civil-marriage/|publisher=ARA News|date=2016-02-20|accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual [[academic conference|conference]] are held in a three-year cycle: with [[American Association for Public Opinion Research]] (AAPOR) in North America (2016), in connection with either [[European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research]] (ESOMAR) or ESRA in Europe (2017), and in the third year in a new location (2018). This arrangement permits WAPOR members to meet with academic, commercial, and government researchers from the main centers of survey research around the globe. Our most recent annual conference was held Austin, Texas, USA during the dates of May 10-12, 2016. &lt;ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Yasuo Mizui'''|水井　康雄|Mizui Yasuo|extra=30 May 1925 – 3 September 2008}} was a Japanese stone sculptor who lived in France. He prefers abstract form in [[public art|public sculpture]] within architectural contexts and took part in several [[Academic conference|symposia]] on sculpture in Europe, the US, Israel, and Japan.&lt;ref name="Middleheim"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pas|first1=Johan|title=The Middleheim Collection|date=2010|publisher=S.I. Ludion|location=Antwerp|isbn=978-90-5544-961-3|pages=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Yasuo Mizui entered into [[Kobe University]] in 1944.&lt;ref name="Dictionnaire Bénézit"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bénézit|first1=Emmanuel|title=Dictionnaire Bénézit|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Paris|isbn=2-7000-3040-0|page=685}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], he worked as technician at a company and learned casting.  After his graduation in 1947, he entered [[Tokyo University of the Arts]] and majored in Sculpture. He was taught by Kazuo Kikuchi and [[Hirakushi Denchū]].  The reason of shifting his interest from mechanical engineering to sculpture was because he hoped of possibility of power of art, which has no frontier nor war and he chose "Art [[casting]] – Casting [[Budda|daibutsu]]" as his thesis.&lt;ref name="50 ans de Sculpture"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mizui|first1=Yasuo|title=50 ans de Sculpture|date=2003|publisher=Yasuo Mizui|location=Lacoste|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation from [[Tokyo University of the Arts]] in 1953, he obtained a scholarship from French government to study further at [[École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts]] de Paris from 1953 to 1958, where he learned monumental art and sculpture from [[Alfred Janniot]] and [[Marcel Gimond]].  He apprenticed Apel·les Fenosa from 1954 to 1958 while studying at the university.&lt;ref name="Dictionnaire Bénézit" /&gt; While visiting the atelier, Fenosa assigned Mizui to create one piece of work made by clay every day upon his arrival. After several months, Mizui felt despair from his own creativity. However, he managed to create one at the last minute.  This experience helped his subsequent career to attend the [[International Sculpture Symposium]] and to create large monumental works under the French program 1% for art.&lt;ref name="50 ans de Sculpture" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lavoixdunord.fr/region/villeneuve-d-ascq-met-a-l-honneur-le-sculpteur-ia28b50417n2754813|title=Villeneuve-d'Ascq met à l'honneur le sculpteur japonais Yasuo Mizui|date=5 April 2015|work=La Voix du Nord|language=French|accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Works for Olympic games in Japan and France===
He has created walls of sculptures ''Les murs des fossils (Walls of fossils)'' for [[1964 Summer Olympics|Tokyo Olympic games]] in Tokyo, Japan in 1964 and ''Microcosme et macrocosme'' for [[Winter Olympic Games]] in [[Grenoble]], France.

Yoyogi National Gymnasium is arena for athletic games, located in Yoyogi Park, Tokyo, designed by [[Kenzo Tange]] and it was built between 1961 and 1964. Mizui received a request from Tange in February 1964 and created the wall of art with ten other assistants in [[List of islands of Japan|Kitagi island]] for three months, then, delivered it to Tokyo in August for completion. Foreign media introduced its works in September.
The length of the large abstract wall of reliefs is 93 m in total. They consist of 408 pieces of 1 m 82&amp;nbsp;cm x 60&amp;nbsp;cm x 30&amp;nbsp;cm Mikage stone and the total weight is 160 tons. These Mikage stones come from Kitagi Island, also known as "Stone Island", in [[Okayama]], Japan. 
His concept ''Walls of Fossiles'' expresses 10 landscapes in his deep involvement with experience of life and nature-like memory as fossils; Travel – Flame – Weight – Perfume – Obsession – Water – Wisdom – Sound – Time – Light. As always, he carved all works by hand using chisels and large and small hammer.&lt;ref name="PL Kyodan"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Relief concept for Olympic Gymnagium|journal=Geisei Journal|date=30 March 1964|issue=Church of Perfect Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the term, he, Minister of Cultural Affairs under Charles de Gaulle regime, who has deep knowledge of arts, visited the Olympic Village. He saw the wall of art and said to Mizui "Excellent!".&lt;ref name="1% for art"&gt;{{cite journal|title=1% for art in France – Giving urban city for soul and artists for creative activities|journal=Asahi Journal|date=1 February 1977|issue=The Asahi Shimbun company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1% for art===
[[File:04153開く壁.JPG|280px|right|Wall that Opens]]
In France, the law of 1951 provides that 1% of the state budget is spent on the decoration of public buildings with artwork. The majority of the works of Mizui in France are created under [[percent for art|1% for art]]. He has been built 26 sculptures between 1968 and 1982(for 14 years).&lt;ref name="Mainichi - ask Mizui"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shuzo|first1=Yasui|title=With large sculpture, ask Yasuo Mizui|issue=Evening post|publisher=The Mainichi Newspapers Co., Ltd|date=17 January 1974|location=Tokyo, Japan|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; For The first order from French cultural ministry was to create sculpture at Bordeaux University (department of law) in 1968, where he built ''Jet d'eau pétrifiée (Petrified waterjet)''.&lt;ref name="Bordeaux fountain"&gt;{{cite web|title=Œuvres du "1% artistique"|url=http://patrimoine.bordeaux.free.fr/bordeauxIV.html|website=Art&amp;Fac 2010|publisher=Association C'Dynamique|accessdate=14 February 2016|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; This request was made after his reputation towards Microcosme et Macrocosme at Winter Olympic games in Grenoble. ''Le Mur qui s'ouvre (Wall that Opens)''(cement / 4.5m x 13 x 1.4 / 1972/ located in Lycée Louis Bascan, [[Rambouillet]]) is a retaining wall. The artist used molds of expanded polyester material that cut through the electrical resistance, a very specific technique that Mizui has obtained from his engineering background.&lt;ref name="Memo of 1% for art France"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Memorandum of 1% for art in France|journal=Sankei Shimbun|date=18 November 1983|issue=Evening post|publisher=Sankei Shimbun Co., Ltd|location=Tokyo, Japan|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symposium===
[[File:Clef d'Amour Berlin 2013.jpg|230px|right|Clet d'amour]]
The sculpture symposium gave Mizui an opportunity for a new direction to develop and promote a sense of sculptural monumentality in the urban beauty. It also provided competitions among artists to demonstrate one's ability to create the same material. This movement has been achieved since 1959 in [[:de:Symposion europäischer Bildhauer 1961–1963|St. Margrethen]] in Germany.  The first participation of Mizui was in Austria in 1960. He discovered the charm of work from large stone blocks of 4 meters. In 1962, he created the work, ''Clef d'amour (Key of Love)'' (stone /4m x 0.9 x 0.6) before the [[Berlin Wall]] in Germany. The new bank had the slogan of this symposium: "The wall to the east, creating a sculpture to the west ." The Symposium was awarded German critique prize. He stated " There is a wall between east and west. The wall he created a sad story every day. Our silent anger supported this meeting." Location of the statue has been moved and currently presented at Berlin Square in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Yasuo Mizui «La fête de la Carrière», articles over "Geijyutsushinncho", édition [[Shinchōsha]] Japan, {{p.|80-82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year in 1963, he participated International Sculpture Symposium at [[Manazuru]] City, [[Kanagawa|Kanagawa Prefecture]] in Japan, as a leader, under the financial support from [[Asahi Shimbun Company]], where 11 other sculptors from eight different countries also participated.&lt;ref name="Expectation for Manazuru Symposium"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yasuo|first1=Kamon|title=Expectation for Sculpture Symposium|issue=Morning Post|publisher=Asahi Shimbun Company|date=24 June 1963|location=Tokyo, Japan|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diagonal Yin Yang===
 [[File:00396石の彫刻陰陽.JPG|200px|right|Yin Yang]][[File:04123斜陰陽.JPG|200px|right|Yin Yang]][[File:04115斜陰陽.JPG|200px|right|Yin Yang]]
There is a [[Fontaine-de-Vaucluse]] near to Lacoste where Mizui lived. This is a mysterious fountain, which has love story, dated back to the 14th century.  He stated: "Why not, [[Nachi Falls]] gush somewhere in France as the rain hollows constantly rocks the fountain." When he visited Nachi Falls in Japan later on, his heart and body trembled in front of the cascade and he was convinced: " Waterfall Nachi had really pierced the earth and it rebounds into Fontaine-de-Valucluse." He, at the age of 70 years old, realized "Diagonal Yin Yang" was divided between Japan and France; Two paths, two unfinished cultures. He often questions the place of the two extremes in his sculptural work where he felt caught between the [[Hammer (tool)]] and [[Anvil (tool)|Anvil]]. Along with these two realizations that coexist in his work, one under the influence of another, the Yin and Yang characters are also identified by Mizui, Japan as ( ''Yin'' ), and France as ( ''Yang'' ). This assimilation takes more consistency with the movement that brings these two countries. It is in the conversation and the confrontation between the aspects [[Yin and Yang]], which constantly oppose each other, are answered, push, and embraces he discovers, though this sculpture as a new form. River, a house, or a woman appearance, are as Yin elements. While a flower, a tree, an animal, and a patron will generally have the character of Yang. He constantly questions the expression of his sculpture in terms of strengths ''Yin'' or ''Yang''. He himself says "The response looks like a mask play between truth and falsehood."&lt;ref name="Catalogue Diagonal Yin Yang"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mizui|first1=Yasuo|title=Catalogue Diagonal Yin Yang|date=1995|publisher=Yasuo Mizui|location=Tokyo, Japan|language=Japanese, French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mizui heard by his friend, Tadao Takemoto, who is the writer of ''Andre Malraux and Nachi Waterfall''; [[André Malraux]] said "Nachi Waterfall is the backbone of the [[Shintoism]]."&lt;ref name="AM-Nachi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Takemoto|first1=Tadao|title=André Malraux et la cascade de Nachi|date=1989|publisher=Julliard|location=Paris, France|isbn=2260006558|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Diagonal Yin Yang'' is a series of 40 stone sculptures, made in Japan for the exhibition at Gallery Tatuno Hiranomachi, [[Osaka]], Japan, in 1965. After this exhibition, all his works were transferred to France, in the garden of his residence in Lacoste.  Two statues were offered on the occasion of the exhibition at [[Luxeuil-les-Bains]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="Luxeuil catalogue"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exposition Rétrospective Mizui|url=http://www.musees-franchecomte.com/gallery_files/site_1/829/dp-exposition-mizui-luxeuil-les-bains-2013.pdf|website=musees-franchecomte.com|publisher=Tourist office of Luxeuil-les-bains|accessdate=15 February 2016|language=French|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wall of Hope===
[[File:000717希望の壁.JPG|333px|right|Le Mur de l'Espoir]]
In 1985, during a project with Seita Onishi, a Japanese business man, and philanthropist, Mizui was keen on the actor [[James Dean]]. Together, they had a goal, to create a James Dean Center, which would be located in [[Cholame]], in California in the United States, near the place of the fatal car accident of James Dean. [[File:Le mur de l'espoir.JPG|150px|left|Wall of Hope]]Earlier year in 1981, Mizui had been created and placed chromium cenotaph for James Dean, commissioned by Onishi, near to the place his accident.&lt;ref name="People-Seita Onishi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Obsessed by James Dean, Japan's Seita Onishi Makes a Monument to That Fallen Rebel His Cause|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20120914,00.html|website=People|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=17 February 2016|pages=6|date=7 August 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mizui worked on James Dean Center project for three years, creating sketches and sculptures, as well as visiting the United States. Following a conflict of opinion with the owner of the proposed Center site, the project could not be fulfilled. Yet the "Wall of Hope" remains, a monumental sculpture (Limestone/13 x 4,50 x 1,20 m) dedicated to the memory of James Dean; this sculpture took three years for him to complete; it consists of 150 tons of stone extracted from the quarry of [[Lacoste]], in the village where he lived. On one of the sides of the "Wall of Hope", he sculpted in stone the face of the film icon. "I said to myself, the three masterpieces of James Dean saved his fans from despair, the desperate walls open and give us the light of hope", the artist explains.&lt;ref name="Jean-Noel, JD secret"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coghe|first1=Jean-Noël|title=Jimmy the Kid : James Dean secret : on a tous quelque chose de James Dean--|date=2007|publisher=Hugo doc|location=[Paris]|isbn=978-2755601763|page=364|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Wall of Hope" was inaugurated in 2006, 51 years after the death of the actor, and, though not in California, it welcomes visitors to the garden, like an open-air museum, of Mizui, in Lacoste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yasuo|first1=Mizui|title=50ans de Sculpture|date=2003|publisher=Yasuo Mizui|location=Tokyo, Japan|page=82|language=French, Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stone and Asceticism===
Mizui said: "Given the immense nature, I felt myself very small. In addition, the stone has rough context, but it is already so beautiful.
Although I talked, insulted, and sighed him, he remained transferable and quietly annoyed in spite of my pleas and anger. However, after some time, the stone started to talk. It was he who guided me;'' Not so! And there! Yes, like this.'' ''If I can one day to melt into the divine nothingness, my sculpture will remain as an offering to the great nature."&lt;ref name="Mizue"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pierre et Ascese|journal=Mizue|date=October 1963|publisher=Bijyutsu Shuppan Sha Co., Ltd|location=Tokyo, Japan|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean- Rosenberg, science professor at [[University of Poitiers]], told about the sculpture of Mizui; ''In his non-figurative art, the temporal dimension is absent. There are no messages coded by symbols or figures. His work is cosmic. One feels the origin of life and evolution; it represents the universal entities, which have not individualized, but as they stand at the beginning of evolution.''&lt;ref&gt;Yasuo Mizui, ''50ans de Sculpture'', {{p.|125}},2003&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Métagraphie ===
[[File:Métagraphie Mizui,jpg modifié-1.jpg|200px|right|métagraphie]]
The technique of compressing a color between two sheets of paper or two other materials gave rise to unexpected fantastic images. The artist analyzed the causality of phenomena that may be considered accidental. In other words, it is to introduce the power of the will in the creation of such phenomena, by developing a technique and practice. This process expresses the reflection, change, succession, and the fact of going beyond, beside, and between etc. Obtained by a non-reproducible process, the métagraphie implies that the artist makes the slide watercolor on waterproof paper, then lets it have the chance to act on the matter. His own response is to find the right balance between the fluidity of watercolor and the exposure time. There are similar techniques, such as pressed oil, starch-pressed, and the decal. But the manner and the choice of material of Mizui are different.&lt;ref name="Expo catalogue-luxeuil"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exposition Retrospective Mizui|url=http://www.musees-franchecomte.com/gallery_files/site_1/829/dp-exposition-mizui-luxeuil-les-bains-2013.pdf|website=Musees-franchecomte|publisher=Association L'art dans la Rue|accessdate=17 February 2016|language=French|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An international critic of Fine Arts, Sakae Hasegawa, said in 1984: "When I saw this painting for the first time, I thought this was a picture of a snowy mountain. But looking closer, it was not a picture and this picture had a strong resonance in me, it perceives cold silence. I find this painting conveys a philosophical and meditative opening, as if he could let the silence of the heart.".&lt;ref&gt;Yasuo Mizui, ''50ans de Sculpture'', 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Four completed forms===

;1. The sculpture of the oscillation / ''Oscillo-Relief'', 1972–1982
''Oscillo-Relief'' cut is the shape obtained by the vertical oscillatory motion and horizontal oscillation of an electrical resistance. This free form is not the result of a prior plan, but the technique requires precise control. ''Oscillo-Relief'' is a fundamental invention of Mizui. He applied the technique to his sculptures in 1972. He was invited for The 2nd Henry Moore Grand Prize Exhibition at [[Hakone Open-Air Museum]], in [[Nagano Prefecture]], Japan in 1981, created ''Oscillo-complex''(stone / 3m x 1.3 x 1.2), and received Special Prize at the exhibition.&lt;ref name="2nd Henry Moore -Hakone"&gt;{{cite news|title=The 2nd Henry Moore Grand Prize Exhibition The Hakone Open-Air Museum|publisher=The Hakone Open-Air Museum|date=1981|location=Hakone|language=English, Japanese|format=Exhibition catalogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Hommage à Néguev (To Neguev)" (marble / 3.7m x 1.7 x 0.6 / 1962 / [[Mitzpe Ramon]], Israel, Symposium) performed on the occasion of a Symposium in Israel. About this experience, the artist expresses himself in these words: ''It was a real brainwashing life for two months in the Negev desert. I felt my sculpture as a drop in the sea with immensity of nature. This is the first time that I could hold chisel with sincerely humble. When I made an elliptical hole in the top part, I felt that sun light was rising towards me.''&lt;ref name="Great Nature Paean"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matsumura|first1=Kazuo|title=Great Nature Paean|issue=Evening Post|publisher=Sankei Shimbun Co., Ltd|date=2 December 1985|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"ZIG and ZAG" (stone / 2m x 0.4 x 0.4 / 1973 / [[Savannah College of Art and Design]], [[Lacoste, Vaucluse|Lacoste]]). Mizui first worked with blocks of polystyrene by cutting them to see the final shape of sculpture. He directed dozens of works like this. In the fifties, Parisian artists like to establish their workshop in [[Provence]]. The New Yorker painter, Bernard Pfriem, opened an art school to bring American students in the center of the village of Lacoste, France.&lt;ref name="history o f the lacoste school of the arts"&gt;{{cite web|title=An Unofficial History of the Lacoste School of the Arts|url=https://lacostoise.wordpress.com/|website=Souvenirs de Lacoste|publisher=Worldpress.com|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This school is located in a large house located next to the ancient castle, The Marquis de Sade. He had remained relationship with the school for 20 years, taught students about stone sculpture every summer, and made one piece of work with them every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mizui|first1=Yasuo|title=50ans de Sculpture|date=2003|location=Tokyo|page=34|language=French, Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Yun's granddaughters, named Zhou ({{zh|c=周}}), was recorded in the Yun family [[genealogy book]], which has been used to suggest that her artistic skills were worthy of the Yun clan.&lt;ref name=lu/&gt;

==Art==
Yun's painting style was heavily influenced by her family's preference for the "boneless" technique. She predominantly painted [[bird-and-flower painting]]s, but also painted people, one of which depicts a woman doing her hair known as the ''Hairpin Scroll'' (簪花图轴).&lt;ref name=wen/&gt; Yun is often compared with her contemporary [[Ma Quan]], who similarly specialised in [[bird-and-flower painting]] but favoured strong outlines. The ''Chuyue jiexu wenjian lu'' (初月接续闻见录), compiled in 1818, describes how people throughout the [[Jiangnan]] region described them as the "two without parallel" ({{zh|c=两绝}})&lt;ref name=sina&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2017-11-28/doc-ifypacti8770528.shtml|title=浙博明清女性画家展：看古代闺阁付诸笔端的闲情与才思|trans-title=Zhejiang museum's exhibition of Ming and Qing female artists: the leisure and creativity from the end of a brush in ancient ladies' chambers|editor=Gui Qiang 桂强|publisher=Sina|date=28 November 2017|access-date=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure as [[Viceroy of Liangjiang|governor-general of Liangjiang]], Yi Jishan presented some of Yun's works to [[Empress Xiaoshengxian|Empress Dowager Chongqing]] who in turn showed them to the [[Qianlong Emperor]]. The emperor was reportedly so impressed that he wrote a poem praising her art, after which Yun's reputation as a painter spread.&lt;ref name = wen/&gt;

There is a significant population of '''Zimbabweans in South Africa''', making up [[South Africa]]'s largest group of foreign migrants.&lt;ref name="Polzer2008a"&gt;{{harvnb|Polzer|2008|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of their numbers range from one to five million.&lt;ref name="Polzer2008a" /&gt;

==History==
Temporary labour migration to South Africa has long been a feature of [[Rhodesia]]n and then [[Zimbabwe]]an society. A 2002 survey by the Southern African Migration Project show that almost 25% of adult Zimbabweans' parents or grandparents had worked in South Africa at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tevera|Zinyama|2002|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, permanent emigration is a relatively new phenomenon. There have been two major waves of emigration from Zimbabwe. The first was that of [[white people in Zimbabwe]] who left the country soon after the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] ended the [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] government; the second, still ongoing, was that of ethnic Zimbabweans beginning in the 1990s. In both cases, [[South Africa]] was again their primary destination. From 1994 onwards, the South African government displayed increasing hostility to [[skilled worker|skilled]] immigration from the rest of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tevera|Zinyama|2002|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has not served to limit the number of immigrants; Zimbabwean migration to South Africa since 2000 has been described as the "largest concentrated flow" in the country's history.&lt;ref name="Polzer2008"&gt;{{harvnb|Polzer|2008|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migrants previously consisted of young people arriving alone to look for work, but since 2000 have increasingly shifted towards women, children, and the elderly who are not able to work and require humanitarian assistance.&lt;ref name="Polzer2008" /&gt;

A large proportion of the migrants are irregular; they typically pay [[South African rand|R]]200 to [[people smuggler]]s to take them across the [[Limpopo River]] at night and coordinate with taxi drivers who transport the migrants to [[Johannesburg]] and watch for the approach of police or soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6642619.stm|title=Zimbabwe's starving border jumpers|date=2007-05-10|accessdate=2009-08-25|last=Guerin|first=Orla|periodical=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numbers and distribution==
Estimates of the number of Zimbabwean migrants to South Africa since 2000 range from one to five million. Exact figures are difficult to obtain due to the large proportion of undocumented migrants.&lt;ref name="Polzer2008a" /&gt; There was some [[circular migration|return migration]] to Zimbabwe as a result of xenophobic violence in the [[Xenophobia in South Africa#May 2008 pogroms|2008 riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Time Magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1808958,00.html|accessdate=2009-08-25|last=Lindow|first=Megan|date=2008-05-23|title=Zimbabweans Fleeing South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Reference necessary|text=Most reside in [[Gauteng]], [[Limpopo]], [[Mpumalanga]], and [[North West (South African province)|North West]], with a large concentration in the more economically-advanced urban areas of Gauteng.|date=April 2010}}
