The '''African-American Baseline Essays''' are a series of educational materials commissioned in 1987 by the [[Portland Public Schools (Oregon)|Portland public school district]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] and compiled by [[Asa Grant Hilliard III]], intended to "provide information about the history, culture, and contributions of Africans and African-Americans in the disciplines of Art, Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, and Music," to "be used by teachers and other District staff as a reference and resource just as adopted textbooks and other resources are used" as part of "a huge multicultural curriculum-development effort."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pps.net/cms/lib/OR01913224/Centricity/Domain/179/pdfs/prefc-af.pdf |title=Preface to the African/African-American Baseline Essays |last=Prophet |first=Matthew W. |date=Spring 1987 |website=Portland Public Schools |access-date=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Despite criticism of their inaccuracies and "Egypt-centric" outlook, the Baseline Essays were widely adopted in the early 90s by large school districts throughout the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How Valid Are the Portland Baseline Essays? |last=Martel |first=Erich |date=December 1991 |access-date=July 7, 2018 |url=http://shop.ascd.org/ASCD/pdf/journals/ed_lead/el_199112_martel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=D'Antonio |first=Michael |date=Feb 11, 1996 |title=Science fights back: is it winning? |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=July 7, 2018 |url=http://ezproxy.lapl.org/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.lapl.org/docview/2044185102?accountid=6749}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the debut of the African-American Baseline Essays, three other series have been released as part of the "PPS Geocultural Baseline Essay Series," focused around "[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]]," "[[Hispanic-Americans]]," and "[[Asian-Americans]]."&lt;ref name="pps"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pps.net/Page/816|title=Baseline Essays|website=Portland Public Schools|access-date=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Their inclusion of the essay "African and African-American Contributions to Science and Technology" by Hunter Havelin Adams III&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pps.net/cms/lib/OR01913224/Centricity/Domain/179/pdfs/be-af-sc.pdf|title=African and African-American Contributions to Science and Technology|last=Adams|first=Hunter Havelin III|website=Portland Public Schools|access-date=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was criticized in particular for promoting [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] ideas like [[astrology]], [[psychokinesis]], and "psychoenergetics" as "[[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/multicultural_pseudoscience_spreading_scientific_illiteracy|title=Multicultural Pseudoscience: Spreading Scientific Illiteracy Among Minorities|last=Ortiz De Montellano|first=Bernard|date=Fall 1991|website=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|access-date=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams' essay is referenced in the article behind the [[Sokal affair]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html|title=Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity|last=Sokal|first=Alan D.|access-date=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in light of this the Baseline Essays themselves have sometimes been called a hoax,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textbookleague.org/92hoax.htm|title=Recalling the Portland Hoax|last=Bennetta|first=William J.|date=May-June 1998|website=The Textbook League|access-date=July 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180821122302/http://www.textbookleague.org/92hoax.htm|archive-date=2018-08-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are still available on the Portland Public Schools web site.&lt;ref name="pps" /&gt;

The '''Allied Schools''' constitute an association of [[independent schools]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alliedschools.org.uk/ |title=The Allied Schools |access-date=2007-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203145427/http://www.alliedschools.org.uk/ |archive-date=2008-02-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly known as the Church of England Trust, it was established in 1923 when the Revd. [[Percy Warrington]], vicar of [[Monkton Combe]] founded [[Canford School]] in [[Dorset]], and [[Stowe School]] in [[Buckinghamshire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Evangelicals in the Church of England 1734&amp;ndash;1984''; Kenneth Hylson Smith, 1989, p.270&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation grew to 10 schools in Britain and a girls' school in [[Kenya]].The trustees of the schools were then all trustees of the Martyrs' Memorial and [[Church of England]] Trust. When the schools ran into severe financial difficulties during the [[Great Depression]], they were rescued by mortgages from the [[Legal &amp; General|Legal and General Assurance Society]], but under a new management scheme in 1934 the Martyrs' Trust was permitted to nominate only one sixth of the governors of schools. The loans were finally repaid in 1980, when a revised scheme of management was agreed, creating the Allied Schools Council.

The association offers two levels of membership &amp;ndash; Associate, and Full. Associate members get support from the organisation's [[head office]] in [[Banbury]], [[Oxfordshire]] in return for an annual fee. In this way the organisation offers an insurance policy against difficult times, as well as administrative support. They also act as a network between schools for the purpose of sharing information and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''The Independent Schools Guide 2004&amp;ndash;2005''; Gabbitas Educational Consultants, 2004, p.462&lt;/ref&gt; Full members get the same benefits, as well as support when they need it from other full members.

Current members are:

*[[Canford School]], [[Dorset]]
*[[Stowe School]], [[Buckinghamshire]]
*[[Harrogate Ladies' College]], [[Yorkshire]]
*[[Westonbirt School]], [[Gloucestershire]]
*[[Wrekin College]], [[Shropshire]]


The organisation is run by a Council, which is independently chaired and members include the chairmen of full member schools.

'''Amalia Holst''' (''[[née]]'' '''Amalia von Justi'''; 10 February 1758–6 January 1829) was a [[Germany|German]] writer, [[intellectual]], and [[feminist]]. Her work examined traditional [[pedagogy]] and challenged [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. She is often called the German counterpart to [[Mary Wollstonecraft]].&lt;ref name="Sotiropoulos 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sotiropoulos|first=Carol Strauss|title=Scandal Writ Large in the Wake of the French Revolution: The Case of Amalia Holst|journal=Women in German Yearbook|year=2004|volume=20|pages=98–121|jstor=20688974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still little known about Amalia Holst’s life. She rose to prominence in the late 1700s through her works as a teacher, although she became more widely recognized in the 1970s after her work was rediscovered and published.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emanzipationsprüche zwischen der Querelle des Femmes und der modernen Frauenbewegung|last=Spitzer|first=Elke|publisher=Kassel University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=163–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

=== Early life ===
Amalia Holst was born in 1758 in [[Mecklenburg]]. She is the daughter of Johanna Maria Magdalena Marchand and [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bloomsbury Dictionary of 18th Century German Philosophers|last=Klemme|first=Heiner|last2=Kuehn|first2=Manfred|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2016|isbn=1474255981|location=|pages=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the oldest of six children from her father’s second marriage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her father was a well-known political economist and the [[Prussian]] chief inspector of mines. He was also a feminist, who published pieces advocating for improved women’s education.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When Holst was 10 years old, he was accused of embezzling funds and imprisoned in Küstrin where he died several years later.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After her father’s death, the family was split up. Their possessions had to be dissolved. Holst’s mother went to live with her brother, who was a pastor in Brunswick. Her younger sisters were lodged into a monastery in Potsdam and her brother was admitted into a Danish cadet school. It is unknown what happened to Holst during this time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In large part due to Justi’s progressive beliefs, Holst was one of only very few women to receive a college education during this time.&lt;ref name="Sotiropoulos 2004" /&gt; She is also said to have received a doctorate in philosophy&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; from the University of Kiel.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Marriage and children ===
Her name appeared again 20 years later in 1791 when at the age of 33, she married Ludolf Holst, a lawyer as well as the director of the Pedagogical Institute in Hamburg-St Georg. They had three children together, one son and two daughters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Career ===
That same year she published her first work, ''Observations on the Errors of our Modern Education by a Practical Teacher (''German'': Bemerkungen über die Fehler unserer Modernen Erziehung von einer Praktischen Erzieherin)''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; after having supported herself through teaching from a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Productive Men, Reproductive Women: The Agrarian Household and the Emergence of Separate Spheres During the German Enlightenment|last=Gray|first=Marion W.|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2000|isbn=1571811729|location=New York|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1792-1802, Holst was the headmistress of the preschool that her husband oversaw.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During this time, she also opened several small schools in [[Hamburg]], [[Wittenberg]] and [[Boizenburg]]. These schools were short-lived however, and the reason for their closings is not known.&lt;ref name="Sotiropoulos 2004" /&gt;

Holst published "Letters on Elisa, or Women as they Ought to be" (German: “Breife über Elisa, oder das Weib wie es seyn sollte"), the second of her three known works, in 1799. It was written in response to the novel, which according to Holst dangerously extolled the marital oppression of the title character. In it she also strongly advocated for marital equality and female autonomy. She argued that women should be defined as human beings first and wives second. This was the beginning of her involvement in a larger debate about [[feminism]] occurring during this time.&lt;ref name="Sotiropoulos 2004" /&gt;

In 1802, Holst published her final work: ''On the Purpose of Women’s Advanced Intellectual Development'' (German: ''Über die Bestimmung des Weibes zur höhern Geistesbildung'')''.''&lt;ref name="Sotiropoulos 2004" /&gt;

=== Death and afterward ===
Holst passed away in Groß-Timkenberg on January 6, 1829.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She is memorialized in [[Judy Chicago| Judy Chicago’s]] installation art piece [[The Dinner Party]] which features a triangular table with 39 place settings, each commemorating important women in history. While she is not given a place setting, her name, along with the names of 998 other feminist icons, is inscribed in gold on the white tile floor below the table.&lt;ref name="brooklyn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/amelia_holst.php|title=Amelia Holst|work=The Dinner Party: Heritage Floor|publisher=[[Brooklyn Museum]]|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

=== Observations on the Errors of Our Modern Education by a Practical Teacher ===
Published in 1791, it criticizes widely accepted conservative pedagogical theories, specifically those of [[Joachim Heinrich Campe|Campe]] and [[Johann Bernhard Basedow|Basedow]].&lt;ref name="Sotiropoulos 2004" /&gt; Holst analyzes their ideas from the perspective of an educator, and points out the flaws and contradictions within them. She also calls attention to the impractical nature of their ideas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Letters on Elisa ===
In 1799 Holst responded to the success of the novel ''Elisa'', which appeared in its fifth edition. She wrote four letters to the title character criticizing the self-sacrificing and submissive role of women. This seems to be her first public push for gender equality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to Holst, a woman's attachment to her spouse did not detract from her autonomy. However, she also emphasized a woman's responsibility to her domestic duty and referred to her own marriage as "a domestic bliss."

=== On the Purpose of Women’s Advanced Intellectual Development ===
In this work, Holst makes the case for higher, ungendered education for males and females alike. This notion was very radical: unlike many of the prominent female-education advocates before her such as [[Sophie von La Roche|La Roche]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], Holst rejected the idea of separate curriculums for each gender, believing that women could and should learn the same things men do. This was not an accepted idea at the time. Her ideas diverged from most her contemporary equal education advocates as well, including the likes of [[Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Elder|Hippel]], Wollstonecraft and [[Marquis de Condorcet|Condorcet]]: while they were in favor of an advanced public coeducation system, Holst insisted on a professional maternal educator who would instruct her children in all academic disciplines from early childhood through adolescence. Only women who were thoroughly educated themselves were fit to educate the next generation, and thus Holst reasoned that every woman was to be educated. She advocated for an in depth knowledge of history, the sciences, philosophy, geography and the arts. Holst stressed that the most important quality of an effective maternal educator was the ability to draw meaningful connections among all disciplines. She also placed an emphasis on individual perfection, urging women to continually engage in intellectual pursuits throughout the course of their lives.&lt;ref name="Sotiropoulos 2004" /&gt;

She made several demands for female education:
* Women were to have complete freedom to study every subject.
* They were to be given access to original sources, as opposed to those specifically written for women, which she claimed offered “superficial knowledge” and which “treat [women] like overgrown children.”
* Exceptionally intelligent women were to have access to a formal university education. They were also to be free of the pressure to have children. She used the philosophers [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] as examples, noting that both were celibate but their “immortal works, the offspring of their minds, have enriched the world.” Why then, Holst argued, shouldn’t the same apply to women?
* It was to be accepted that women were capable of achieving in the most advanced fields of thought. Holst asserts “there exists no proof that a woman’s mind cannot comprehend the higher sciences.”&lt;ref name="Sotiropoulos 2004" /&gt;

== BrainPop characters ==
Tim and Moby are the main characters in most BrainPop movies.&lt;ref name=Edsurge /&gt;

=== Tim ===
Tim is a teenager who does most of the talking in the movies and understands what Moby says. The design on his shirt usually matches the topic being covered.  At the beginning of each video, Tim reads a letter from a student asking about the topic.&lt;ref name=WayToUse&gt;[http://www.brainpop.com/new_common_images/files/68/68609_ideas_home.pdf "Ways to Use BrainPop at Home"], Brainpop, 2007, accessed March 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Often at the end of the movies, Moby will humorously annoy Tim, or vice versa.&lt;ref name=Sparktop&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100308033750/http://www.sparktop.org/explore/brainpop.html Brainpop movies and profiles of Tim and Moby] at Sparktop.org&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moby ===
Moby the Robot is an orange [[robot]] who communicates in beeping noises. The three lights on his chest light up when he beeps, and Tim usually translates what he's saying. Moby is Tim's friend but loves to drive him crazy. Moby helps out by fetching things for Tim and asking questions about the topic they are discussing. As a robot, he can do things that people are unable to do, such as changing his hand into a freeze-ray, sending himself back in time, throwing garbage into a [[black hole]] in space, removing his head, and using lasers. Some of the movies, such as the Earth, Radar and [[Milky Way]] videos, imply that Moby is of an extraterrestrial origin. However, the [[Leonardo da Vinci]] movie implies that he was invented by da Vinci.&lt;ref name=Sparktop /&gt;

=== Other characters ===
'''Cassie''' and '''Rita''' are two teenage girls, who are best friends and are mainly featured in comics that accompany many of the movies in the "FYI" section. They also occasionally appear in the main movies and even narrate a few of them. Rita tends to be more composed and intelligent, while Cassie tends to be more absent-minded. Like Moby, Cassie enjoys annoying Tim, while some of the movies imply that Rita has a romantic interest in Tim and that he returns her feelings.

'''Bob''' is a rat with a broken tail and a patched chest.  He is featured in, and often conducts, experiments called "Experiments with Bob the Ex-Lab Rat", which relate to mostly science movies.&lt;ref name=WayToUse /&gt;

'''Gary''' and '''gary''' are a father and son featured in comics called "How To With Gary and gary", which show how to do something safely. The capitalized "Gary" is the father, and the lowercase "gary" is the son.

== BrainPop Jr. ==
BrainPop Jr. was launched in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrett, Kevin. [http://www.ncs-tech.org/?p=653 "BrainPop Jr. has launched!"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327184508/http://www.ncs-tech.org/?p=653 |date=March 27, 2012 }} September 5, 2006, accessed July 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to BrainPop in subject areas, but the movies are geared towards grades K-3 (age 5-9).

=== Characters in BrainPop Jr. ===
'''Annie''' is a young girl who narrates the movies. She wears red framed glasses and also works with Moby.  She has a teenage sister named Mia. There are many hints in BrainPop Jr. that Annie is Mexican. For instance, her dog's name is Señor Maurice, and she sometimes refers to her father as "Papi".

In BrainPop Jr., Moby shows his emotions more often, like crying or getting excited. Moby is more kind-hearted in BrainPop Jr. than in BrainPop.  He can also do things that he can't do in the BrainPop videos, like sneeze, sweat, and drink water. He can also be sick and smell flowers.

'''Frank''' and '''Joey''' are two fish that star in the comic strip "Belly Up."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9825">&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Carla DeSola.png|thumb|Carla DeSola in about 1980]] --&gt;'''Carla DeSola''' (born 1937) is a choreographer, teacher, and performer who has built her reputation as a pioneer and advocate of [[liturgical dance]] over more than 40 years. In 1974 she founded the Omega Liturgical Dance Company which was soon based at the [[Cathedral of St. John the Divine]] in New York. In the 1990s she founded the Omega West Dance Company in the San Francisco Bay area. A Carla DeSola collection is being developed in the archives of the [[Graduate Theological Union]] library in Berkeley, Ca.

== Training and early initiatives in liturgical dance ==

Born on 24 April 1937, Carla Desola grew up in New York City.&lt;ref name=summers&gt;[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0jn9b19p Lindsey Timmons Summers, ''White Soul/Forbidden Body'', PhD dissertation, University of California Riverside, August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, she danced informally and also spent a year at the [[Hanya Holm]] dance school.&lt;ref name=summers/&gt; She studied dance for four years at the [[Juilliard School of Music]] where she was inspired by the work of her teacher [[José Limón]], especially by his ballet ''Missa Brevis'' and other dance work with religious and spiritual elements.&lt;ref name=summers/&gt; After graduating from Juilliard in 1960&lt;ref&gt;[http://spiritmovesomega.weebly.com/carla-de-sola.html Martha Ann Kirk, Th.D, Carla DeSola ]&lt;/ref&gt; she began to develop a modern dance company, but then changed direction, experimented with [[liturgical dance]] and founded the Omega Liturgical Dance Company (Omega). This was named after the [[Omega Point]], a spiritual concept of [[Teilhard de Chardin]]'s. The dance company was offered space in the crypt of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] cathedral, St. John the Divine, where DeSola built a studio with her future husband, Arthur Eaton.

Around 1970 DeSola, who had grown up in a non-religious Jewish home, became interested in Catholicism and eventually converted. She also became interested in social issues, and was particularly concerned about poverty.&lt;ref name=verbum&gt;[http://www.uiw.edu/verbumincarnatum/vi2014issue/verbumincarnatum2014.pdf Martha Ann Kirk, ThD, Blessed is She Who Dances for Justice and Peace, in ''Verbum Incarnatum'', Vol 6, 2014, ps 81-100]&lt;/ref&gt; These interests overlapped with themes she explored in dances choreographed for Omega and performed at the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]] in Philadelphia and also at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=verbum/&gt; DeSola presented ideas derived from her teaching in her 1974 book ''Learning Through Dance''. Three years later she explained more of her dance philosophy in ''The Spirit Moves: A Handbook of Dance and Prayer''.&lt;ref name=verbum/&gt;

== Career ==
In 1978 a critic in the ''New York Times'' wrote: “As a contemporary form, it [liturgical dance] was virtually nonexistent in this country before Miss DeSola's pioneering efforts a decade ago…”&lt;ref name=MD&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/03/archives/the-newold-art-of-liturgical-dance-liturgical-dance.html Mark Deitch, The New‐Old Art Of Liturgical Dance, in the ''New York Times'', 3 Dec 1978, p18]&lt;/ref&gt; She gradually integrated her formal training with her aim of expressing worship and prayer through dance.&lt;ref name=MD/&gt; DeSola places an emphasis on the "overlap between body and spirit", and believes people can experience dancing as a kind of "movement meditation".&lt;ref name=CS&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TNsTBpKMq7EC&amp;pg=RA1-PA95&amp;dq Robert Wuthnow, ''Creative Spirituality: The Way of the Artist'', University of California, 2001, p 177]&lt;/ref&gt; She makes a distinction between carefully choreographed dance with confident, experienced performers for services, and teaching that encourages untrained dancers to "move spiritually".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Lifting+the+soul%3A+liturgical+dance+companies+enhance+religious...-a080714379 Lifting the soul: liturgical dance companies enhance religious rituals, ''Dance Magazine'', December 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike religious dance in some traditions, where all dance is spontaneous, DeSola's liturgical dance is well-rehearsed.&lt;ref name=MD/&gt;

This unfamiliar art form was controversial and some Catholics disapproved.&lt;ref name=angelus&gt;[http://www.angelusonline.org/index.php?section=articles&amp;subsection=show_article&amp;article_id=332 Michael Davies, ''Bring on the Dancing Girls'', a March 1980 article later used in ''Pope Paul's New Mass'', pub. Angelus Press 1980]&lt;/ref&gt; A 1980 book, ''Pope Paul's New Mass'' by Michael Davies, criticised DeSola in a chapter asserting “there is no place for dancing, liturgical or otherwise, within the Catholic liturgy”.&lt;ref name=angelus/&gt; DeSola’s work continued to grow and in 1981 she told the ''New York Times'' "acceptance is seeping into all denominations."&lt;ref name=ec&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/20/nyregion/dance-for-some-a-form-of-religious-expression.html Eleanor Charles, DANCE, FOR SOME, A FORM OF RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION, ''New York Times'', 20 Dec 1981]&lt;/ref&gt; Though at that time Omega was most often invited to perform by “liberal groups in the Catholic Church”, by 1981 they had also “performed at churches and synagogues in a half-dozen states”.&lt;ref name=ec/&gt;

It was in the 1980s that Desola first taught a class for the [[Sacred Dance]] Guild, an organisation sympathetic to her work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacreddanceguild.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/carla_desola.pdf Carla DeSola's statement for the Sacred Dance Guild, December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; This was when she made first contact with Dr Doug Adams, professor at the [[Pacific School of Religion]] who initiated the Center for Arts, Religion and Education at the [[Graduate Theological Union]] in Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Douglas-Adams-professor-who-merged-theology-2527101.php San Francisco Chronicle, 29 July 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; He later became influential in her professional life. This period also saw the first year of the Earth Mass celebration at St John's Cathedral in 1985, when dancing choreographed by DeSola was added to [[Paul Winter]]'s music, [[Missa Gaia]]. The Mass is attended by thousands of people and is celebrated annually for the Feast of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]].

In 1990 DeSola moved to California, when she was invited to join the Pacific School of Religion faculty. She also studied there and received a Master of Arts degree in Theology and the Arts in 1993. Since the early 1990s she has been involved with the Center for Arts, Religion and Education at the [[Graduate Theological Union]], teaching and serving on its Board of Directors. She also started the Omega West dance company in San Francisco.

Over the years she has created many liturgical dances for a variety of audiences and congregations. She is known for devising works on the theme of peace,&lt;ref name=verbum/&gt; and has published ''PeaceRites: Dance and the Art of Making Peace''. She has taught in numerous different settings, in the US and abroad, and has been described as a “a liturgical dance pioneer”,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drew.edu/mellonarts/wp-content/uploads/sites/156/2014/08/MisirHiralall-liturgical-article-8-11-14-1.pdf Sabrina D.

She has been recognised with a Bene Award from Modern Liturgy Magazine (1993),&lt;ref name=archives/&gt; a cover photo and story in [[Dance Magazine]] (December 2001),&lt;ref name=verbum/&gt; naming as a “Living Legacy”  at the Sacred Dance Guild Golden Anniversary Festival in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spiritmovesomega.weebly.com/carla-de-sola.html Spirit Moves Omega: Carla De Sola]&lt;/ref&gt; a Distinguished Alumni Award from the Pacific School of Religion (2010 ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacreddanceguild.org/news/newsblurb1209.htm Sacred Dance Guild: Pacific School of Religion Names Carla DeSola to the 2010 Distinguished Alumni]&lt;/ref&gt; the title Honorary Member of the Sacred Dance Guild in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacreddanceguild.org/membership/honorary-members/ SDG - honorary members]&lt;/ref&gt; and becoming a mentor for Dance USA in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://danceusa.org/2016-mentors Dance USA 2016 Mentors]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cleanup|reason=The Carnegie Classifications changed sponsorship on January 1, 2015 &amp; most ref cites are already invalid.|date=October 2014}}

The '''Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education''' is a framework for classifying colleges and universities in the [[United States]]. The framework primarily serves educational and research purposes, where it is often important to identify groups of roughly comparable institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/|title=About Carnegie Classification|last=|first=|date=n.d.|website=The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|publisher=Indiana University Center for Postsecondary Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification includes all [[School accreditation|accredited]], [[academic degree|degree]]-granting colleges and universities in the United States that are represented in the National Center for Education Statistics [[Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System]] (IPEDS).

The Carnegie Classification was created by the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Commission on Higher Education]] in 1970. The classification was first published in 1973 with updates in 1976, 1987, 1994, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To ensure continuity of the classification framework and to allow comparison across years, the 2015 Classification update retains the same structure of six parallel classifications, initially adopted in 2005.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The 2005 report substantially reworked the classification system, based on data from the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 school years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Basic Classification Technical Details | publisher = Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching | year=  2005 | url = http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=805 | accessdate = 24 September 2008 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2014, the Carnegie Foundation transferred responsibility for the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education to the Center for Postsecondary Research of the [[Indiana University School of Education]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], [[Indiana]]. The classification retained the Carnegie name after the Center for Postsecondary Research took over on January 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.carnegiefoundation.org/newsroom/news-releases/iu-research-center-house-carnegie-classification-institutions-higher-education|title=IU research Center to House Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|last=|first=|date=2014-10-08|work=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|access-date=2017-06-02|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctorate-granting Universities===
''Doctorate-granting Universities'' are institutions that awarded at least 20 research/scholarly doctorates in 2013–14. Professional doctorates (M.D., J.D., etc.) are not included in this count. The framework further classifies these universities by their level of research activity, as measured by research expenditures, number of research doctorates awarded, number of research-focused faculty, and other factors.&lt;ref name=BasicTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005).

*''Doctoral Universities - Highest Research Activity (R1)'' (115)
*''Doctoral Universities - Higher Research Activity (R2)'' (107)
*''Doctoral Universities - Moderate Research Activity (R3)'' (113)

===Master's Colleges and Universities===
''Master's Colleges and Universities'' are institutions that "awarded at least 50 master's degrees in 2013–14, but fewer than 20 doctorates."&lt;ref name=BasicTechnical /&gt;

*''Master's Colleges and Universities: Larger programs (M1)'' are larger programs that awarded at least 200 masters-level degrees  (393)
*''Master's Colleges and Universities: Medium programs (M2)'' are medium programs that awarded 100–199 masters-level degrees (207)
*''Master's Colleges and Universities: Smaller programs (M3)'' are small programs that awarded 50-99 masters-level degrees (141)

===Baccalaureate Colleges===
''Baccalaureate Colleges'' are institutions where "bachelor's degrees accounted for at least 10 percent of all undergraduate degrees and they awarded fewer than 50 master's degrees (2013–14-degree conferrals)."&lt;ref name=BasicTechnical /&gt;

*''Baccalaureate Colleges—Arts &amp; Sciences'' (259)

*''Associate's Colleges: High Career - Mixed Traditional/Nontraditional'' (123)
*''Associate's Colleges: High Career - High Nontraditional'' (184)

===Special Focus Institutions===
''Special Focus Institutions'' were classified "based on the concentration of degrees in a single field or set of related fields, at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Institutions were determined to have a special focus with concentrations of at least 80 percent of undergraduate and graduate degrees. In some cases this percentage criterion was relaxed if an institution identified a special focus on the [[College Board]]'s Annual Survey of Colleges, or if an institution's only accreditation was from a body related to the special focus categories".&lt;ref name=BasicTechnical /&gt;

*''Special Focus Two-Year: Health Professions'' (267)
*''Special Focus Two-Year: Technical Professions'' (62)
*''Special Focus Two-Year: Arts and Design'' (41)

===Not classified===
The Basic Classification omits 26 institutions.

==Undergraduate Instructional Program==
The ''Undergraduate Instructional Program'' classification combines (a) the ratio of Arts and sciences and professional fields (as defined in the [http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2002165 Classification of Instructional Programs] (CIP)) and (b) the coexistence of programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels (again using the CIP).&lt;ref name=UIPTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=793 Technical Details &gt; Undergraduate Instructional Program].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts and sciences and professional fields===
The framework categorizes institutions based on the proportion of undergraduate majors in arts and sciences or professional fields, based on their two-digit CIP.&lt;ref name=UIPTechnical /&gt;

* ''Associates Only (Assoc)'' only award associate degrees.
* ''Associates Dominant (Assoc-Dom)'' award some bachelor's degrees, but award more associates's degrees.
* ''Arts &amp; Sciences Focus (A&amp;S-F)'' award least 80 percent of undergraduate degrees in the arts and sciences.
* ''Arts &amp; Sciences + Professions (A&amp;S+Prof)'' award between 80 and 59 percent of undergraduate degrees in the arts and sciences.
* ''Balanced Arts &amp; Sciences/Professions (Bal)'' award 41 to 59 percent of undergraduate degrees in each domain.
* ''Professions + Arts &amp; Sciences (Prof+A&amp;S)'' award between 80 and 59 percent of undergraduate degrees in a professional field.
* ''Professions Focus (Prof-F)'' award at least 80 percent of undergraduate degrees in a professional field.

===Graduate coexistence===
The framework categorizes institutions based on the proportion of undergraduate and graduate programs (defined by their 4-digit CIP) that coexist.&lt;ref name=UIPTechnical /&gt;

* ''No coexistence (NGC)''—no programs coexist.
* ''Some coexistence (SGC)''—some graduate programs coexist with undergraduate programs but fewer than half.
* ''High coexistence (HGC)''—at least half of the graduate programs coexist with undergraduate programs.

==Graduate instructional program==
The ''Graduate Instructional Program'' classification indicates (a) if the institution awards just master's degrees or master's degrees and doctoral degrees, and (b) in what general categories they  predominantly award graduate degrees. Institutions that do not award graduate degrees are not classified by this scheme.&lt;ref name=GIPTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=794 "Technical Details &gt; Graduate Instructional Program"].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postbaccalaureate graduate programs===
Institutions that offer graduate and professional programs (such as law schools) but do not award the doctorate are classified as having ''Postbaccalaureate'' graduate programs.&lt;ref name=GIPTechnical /&gt; These programs are classified by the fields in which the degrees are awarded.

*Single postbaccalaureate (education) (S-PostBac/Ed)''—only offer graduate training in education.
*''Single postbaccalaureate (business) (S-PostBac/Bus)''—only offer graduate training in business.
*''Single postbaccalaureate (other field) (S-PostBac/Other)''—only offer graduate training in a field other than education or business.
*''Postbaccalaureate comprehensive (PostBac-Comp)''—offer graduate training in the humanities, social sciences, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Medicine (STEM), and one or more professional fields.
*''Postbaccalaureate, arts &amp; sciences dominant (PostBac-A&amp;S)''—only offer graduate training in the arts and sciences.
*''Postbaccalaureate with arts &amp; sciences (education dominant) (PostBac-A&amp;S/Ed)—''offer graduate training primarily in the arts and sciences with some training in education.
*''Postbaccalaureate with arts &amp; sciences (business dominant) (PostBac-A&amp;S/Bus)''—offer graduate training primarily in the arts and sciences with some training in business.
*''Postbaccalaureate with arts &amp; sciences (other dominant fields) (PostBac-A&amp;S/Other)''—offer graduate training primarily in the arts and sciences with some training in a field other than education or business.
*''Postbaccalaureate professional (education dominant) (PostBac-Prof/Ed)''—offer graduate training primarily in professional fields with some training in education.
*''Postbaccalaureate professional (business dominant) (PostBac-Prof/Bus)''—offer graduate training primarily in professional fields with some training in business.
*''Postbaccalaureate professional (other dominant fields) (PostBac-Prof/Other)''—offer graduate training primarily in professional fields with some training in a field other than education or business.

===Doctoral degree programs===
Institutions that offer doctoral degrees, including medical and veterinary degrees, are classified by the field in which they award degrees.&lt;ref name=GIPTechnical /&gt;

*''Single doctoral (education) (S-Doc/Ed)'' only award doctoral degrees in education.
*''Single doctoral (other field) (S-Doc/Other)'' only award doctoral degrees in a single non-education field.
*''Comprehensive doctoral with medical/veterinary (CompDoc/MedVet)'' (a) award doctorates in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields, (b) graduate or professional degrees in one or more professional fields, and (c) award medical or veterinary doctoral degrees.
*''Comprehensive doctoral (no medical/veterinary) (CompDoc/NMedVet)'' (a) award doctorates in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields, (b) graduate or professional degrees in one or more professional fields, and (c) do not award medical or veterinary doctoral degrees.
*''Doctoral, humanities/social sciences dominant (Doc/HSS)'' award most of their doctorates in the humanities and social sciences.
*''Doctoral, [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] dominant (Doc/STEM)'' award most of their doctorates in STEM fields.
*''Doctoral, professional dominant (Doc/Prof)'' award most of their doctorates are awarded in professional fields other than engineering.

==Enrollment profile==
The Enrollment Profile of institutions are classified according to (a) the level of the highest degree awarded and (b) the ratio of undergraduate to graduate students.&lt;ref name=EPTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=795 Technical Details &gt; Enrollment Profile Program].&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Exclusively undergraduate two-year (ExU2)''—students are not awarded bachelor's or higher degrees.
*''Exclusively undergraduate four-year (ExU4)''—students are only awarded bachelor's degrees.
*''Very high undergraduate (VHU)''—fewer than 10 percent of students are graduate students.
*''High undergraduate (HU)''—more than 10 percent, but fewer than 25 percent of students are graduate students.
*''Majority undergraduate (MU)''—more than 24 percent, but fewer than 50 percent of students are graduate students.
*''Majority graduate/professional (MGP)''—fewer than 50 percent of students are undergraduates.
*''Exclusively graduate/professional (ExGP)—''students are only awarded degrees higher than bachelor's.

==Undergraduate profile==
The framework classifies institutions' ''Undergraduate Profile'' according to (a) the proportion of part-time undergraduate students to full-time students, (b) the institutions selectivity in admitting undergraduate students, and (c) the percentage of students who transfer into the university.&lt;ref name=UPTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=796 Technical Details &gt; Undergraduate Profile].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enrollment status===
The framework classifies ''Enrollment Status'' according to the ratio of part-time to full-time students (degree seeking students in four-year institutions).&lt;ref name=UPFlowchart&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/dynamic/downloads/file_1_338.pdf Undergraduate Profile] classification flow chart.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''PT2'': Higher part-time two-year—more than 60 percent of students at this 2-year institution are part-time.
*''Mix2'': Mixed part/full-time two-year—between 39 and 60 percent of students at this 2-year institution are part-time.
*''MFT2'': Medium full-time two-year—more than 60 but fewer than 91 percent of students at this 2-year institution are full-time.
*''FT2'': Higher full-time two-year—more than 90 percent of students at this 2-year institution are full-time.
*''PT4'': Higher part-time four-year—more than 39 percent of students at this 4-year or higher institution are part-time.
*''MFT4'': Medium full-time four-year—more than 60 percent but fewer than 80 percent of students at this 4-year or higher institution are full-time.
*''FT4'': Full-time four-year—more than 79 percent of students at this 4-year or higher institution are full-time.

===Achievement characteristics/selectivity===
''Selectivity'' is classified according to the [[SAT]] and [[ACT (examination)|ACT]] scores of first-time first-year students. This classification only applies to four-year or higher institutions.  As of the 2010 edition the criteria were as follows (http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/methodology/ugrad_profile.php)&lt;ref name=UPTechnical /&gt;
*''Inclusive (I)''—students had a 25th percentile ACT-equivalent score below 18.
*''Selective (S)''—students had a 25th percentile ACT-equivalent score from 18 to 21.
*''More Selective (MS)''—students had a 25th percentile ACT-equivalent score greater than 21.

===Transfer origin===
''Transfer origin'' characterizes the percentage of students who transfer to the institution, and only applies to four-year or higher institutions.&lt;ref name=UPTechnical /&gt;
*''Lower transfer-in (LTI)''—fewer than 20 percent of students transfer into the institution.
*''Higher transfer-in (HTI)''—more than 19 percent of students transfer into the institution.

==Size and setting==
''Size and Setting'' classifies institutions according to (a) size of their student body and (b) percentage of student who reside on campus. This does not apply to exclusively graduate and professional institutions and special-focus institutions.&lt;ref name=SSTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=797 Technical Details &gt; Size &amp; Setting].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size===
The ''size'' of institutions is based on their ''full-time equivalent (FTE)'' enrollment. FTEs are calculated by adding the number of full-time students to one-third the number of part-time students.  Two-year colleges are classified using a different scale than four-year and higher institutions.&lt;ref name=SSTechnical /&gt;

*''Very small two-year (VS2)''—fewer than 500 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*''Small two-year (S2)''—at least 500 but fewer than 2000 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*''Medium two-year (M2)''—at least 2000 but fewer than 5000 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*''Large two-year (L2)''—at least 5000 but fewer than 10000 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*''Very large two-year (VL2)''—10000 or more FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*''Very small four-year (VS4)''—fewer than 1000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.
*''Small four-year (S4)''—at least 1000 but fewer than 3000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.
*''Medium four-year (M4)''—at least 3000 but fewer than 10000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.
*''Large four-year (L4)''—more than 10000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.

===Setting===
''Setting'' is based on the percentage of full-time undergraduates who live in institutionally-managed housing.&lt;ref name=SSTechnical /&gt; Two-year institutions are not classified by setting.&lt;ref name=SSFlowchart&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/dynamic/downloads/file_1_373.pdf Size and Setting] classification flow chart.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Primarily nonresidential (NR)''—fewer than 25 percent of degree-seeking undergraduates or fewer than 50 percent enrolled full-time live on campus.&lt;ref name=SSTechnical /&gt;
*''Primarily residential (R): (a)''—at least 25 percent of degree-seeking undergraduates live on campus and (b) at least 50 percent but fewer than 80 percent attend full-time.
*''Highly residential (HR)''—at least half of degree-seeking undergraduates live on campus and at least 80 percent attend full-time.&lt;ref name=SSTechnical /&gt;

==2005 edition==
In contrast to previous classifications, the 2005 classification scheme provides a "...set of multiple, parallel classifications."&lt;ref name=MainWebsite&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/ The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822000000/http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/ |date=22 August 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alexander C. McCormick, Senior Scholar at The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and director of the classifications project, "The five new classifications are organized around three central questions: 1) What is taught, 2) to whom, and 3) in what setting?"&lt;ref name=McCormickPerspective&gt;McCormick, Alexander C. (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/perspectives/sub.asp?key=245&amp;subkey=882 A New Set of Lenses for Looking at Colleges and Universities], [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/perspectives/index.asp?key=532 Carnegie Perspectives], November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the new classification categories, the previously used classification scheme ("Basic classification") has been revised.

The Carnegie Foundation is also developing one or more voluntary classification schemes that rely on data submitted by institutions.&lt;ref name=MainWebsite /&gt; The first focuses on outreach and community engagement, and the second on "...how institutions seek to analyze, understand, and improve undergraduate education."&lt;ref name=McCormickPerspective /&gt;

The Carnegie Foundation has no plans to issue printed editions of the classifications. Their [https://web.archive.org/web/20080822012422/http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/ website] has several tools that let researchers and administrators view classifications.&lt;ref name=PrintFAQ&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/about/sub.asp?key=18&amp;subkey=405#13 Carnegie Classification FAQs: Will the classifications be available in print?].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revisions in the basic classification===
The "basic classification" is an update of the original classification scheme. In addition to changing names of some categories, the 2005 revision differs from previous editions in that it:&lt;ref name=BasicTechnical /&gt;

# Splits Associates colleges into subcategories. This is based on the work of Stephen Katsinas, Vincent Lacey, and David Hardy at the [[University of Alabama]] and is an update of work funded in the 1990s by the [[Ford Foundation]].
# Categorizes doctorate-granting institutions according to their level of research activity. This level is calculated using multiple measures, financial and otherwise.
# Simplifies the measurement of doctorate degrees awarded.
# Divides Master's colleges and universities into three categories based on the number of [[Master's degrees]] awarded.
# Deprecates "[[Liberal Arts]]" terminology.{{Request quotation|date=May 2014}}
# Modified the criteria separating Master's and Baccalaureate institutions. Institutions formerly classified as Master's Colleges and Universities are now classified as Baccalaureate Colleges.
# Requires institutions to have higher levels of single-field or related-field concentration for designation as special-focus institutions and utilizes more sources of information to identify special-focus institutions.
# Splits the "Schools of engineering and technology" category into two categories and eliminates the "Teacher's colleges" category.
# Measures and classifies service academies using to the same criteria as other institutions.

==Previous editions==
Prior to the 2000 edition, the Carnegie Foundation categorized doctorate-granting institutions according to the amount of [[Federal Government of the United States|federal]] funding they received.  The 2005 edition categorizes doctoral-institutions according to their research support but uses a more complex formula than used in previous editions.  Despite the fact that it is no longer used by the Carnegie Foundation, the descriptor ''[[Research I university|Research&amp;nbsp;I]]'' is still commonly used in reference to universities with the largest research budgets, often by the institutions themselves in their promotional materials.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

'''Universidad Autónoma Chapingo''' (Chapingo Autonomous University) is an agricultural college located in [[Texcoco, Mexico State]] in Mexico. The university is a federally funded public institution of higher education. It offers technical and full bachelor's degrees as well as having scientific and technological research programs. Many of these programs are related to agriculture, forestry and fishing.&lt;ref name="uach"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://portal.chapingo.mx/rectoria/?modulo=universidad |title=Rectoría |publisher=Universidad Autonoma de Chapingo |location=Texcoco, Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109102242/http://portal.chapingo.mx/rectoria/?modulo=universidad |archivedate=2010-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school began as the Escuela Nacional de Agricultura (National School of Agriculture) which was founded in 1854 at the Monastery of San Jacinto in Mexico City. The school was moved in 1923 to the President [[Álvaro Obregón]]&lt;ref name="historiauac"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://portal.chapingo.mx/rectoria/?modulo=historia |title=Historia |publisher=Universidad Autonoma de Chapingo |location=Texcoco, Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906131307/http://portal.chapingo.mx/rectoria/?modulo=historia |archivedate=2009-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="novo140"&gt;{{cite book |title= The State of Mexico |last=Novo |first=Gerardo |author2=Jorge de la Luz |year=2002 |publisher= Ediciones Nueva Guia SA de CV |location= Madrid |isbn=968-5437-26-2  |page=140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ex Hacienda of Chapingo.  Postgraduate studies were added in 1959. The school received autonomous status in 1978. It offers courses of study in Forestry, Agricultural Economics, Agricultural Industries, Irrigation, Rural Sociology and more.&lt;ref name="historiauac"/&gt;

The main attraction for visitors at this school is its murals. In the old hacienda chapel, which is now the University Ceremonies Room is a mural by [[Diego Rivera]] called “Tierra Fecundada” (Fertile Land). This work was begun in 1924 and completed in 1927. Covering an area of over 700m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the work divides into three parts. The left panel depicts man’s struggle to have land, the right panel shows the evolution of Mother Nature and the center shows the communion between man and earth. It is considered to be one of Rivera’s best works.&lt;ref name="novo140"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atractivos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texcoco.gob.mx/ciudad_atractivos_culturales_economicos |title=Ciudad / Atractivos turísticos y culturales |publisher=Municipality of Texcoco |location=Texcoco, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=City: Tourist and cultural attractions |accessdate=2010-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100103015303/http://www.texcoco.gob.mx/ciudad_atractivos_culturales_economicos |archivedate=2010-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the school acquired an unnamed mural by [[Luis Nishizawa]]. This work was produced during his last year at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plasticas (ENAP) of [[UNAM]] and depicts the agriculture of Mexico in both the past and the present. The work is six meters high, nine meters wide and in the form of a triangle. It is placed in a building that is commonly called “El Partenon.”&lt;ref name="lvalos"&gt;{{cite news |title= Llevan mural a Chapingo |first= Leopoldo |last=Avalos |newspaper=Reforma  |location= Mexico City  |date=2006-02-16 |page= 14 |language=Spanish |trans-title= Bringing mural to Chapingo}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The school is also home to the '''National Museum of Agriculture'''. The 2,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; facility presents the development of agriculture in Mexico from the pre-Hispanic past to the present day. The collection has about 4,000 objects relating to technology, agronomy including farming implements and photographs by Hanz Gutmann.&lt;ref name="musnatag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/2842-Museo-Nacional-de-Agricultura-de-la-Universidad-Aut%F3noma-de-Chapingo-%28Estado-de-M%E9xico%29 |title=Museo Nacional de Agricultura de la Universidad Autónoma de Chapingo (Estado de México) |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=The National Museum of Agriculture of the Autonomous University of Chapingo |accessdate=2010-02-16 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6991">'''David Boynton''' (1945–2007) was a leading expert on the natural history of the Hawaiian island of [[Kauai]], especially on the Koke'e Forest and the [[Alakai Wilderness Preserve|Alakai Swamp]] and its wildlife.[[Image:DavidSpaldingBoynton.JPG|thumb|David Boynton]] He was called "a voice for the Hawaiian wilderness,"&lt;ref name="Hon"/&gt; a "Guardian of the Koke'e Forest,"&lt;ref name="puna"/&gt; and as an educator, "the window through which thousands of Hawai'i students learned about Hawaiian birds, plants, marine creatures, climate and much more."&lt;ref name="Hon"/&gt;  Boynton photographed a bird now believed extinct, the {{okina}}Ō{{okina}}ō{{okina}}ā{{okina}}ā (''[[Moho braccatus]]''). He recorded the [[mating call]] of the single male, whose mate presumably did not survive [[Hurricane Iwa]] at the end of 1982.&lt;ref name="birdlife"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&amp;sid=5355&amp;m=0|title=Kauai Oo Moho braccatus |publisher=Birdlife International  |accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bird, probably the last of its species, was tending an empty nest.&lt;ref name="Hon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cryp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cryptomundo.com/cryptozoo-news/boynton-obit/|title=Extinct Bird Naturalist Dies in Menehune Valley|last=Coleman |first=Loren |date=February 12, 2007|publisher=Cryptozoology News|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Boynton used this poignant recording and story to inspire Hawaiian school children in the traditional Hawaiian values of kuleana, malama, kokua, laulima, ho‘ihi, lokahi, and pono,&lt;ref name="puna"/&gt; which translate roughly as rights and responsibilities to the land, the appropriateness of serving nature,  helping others, cooperation, respect, peace and unity, and duty to do what is right.&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wehewehe.org |title=Ulukau Hawaiian Electronic Library|publisher=University of Hawaii Press. |accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naturalist and teacher==

=== Early life and education ===
David Spalding Boynton, born and raised in [[Oahu]], graduated from the [[Punahou School]] in [[Honolulu]] in 1963, where his alumni profile says he "would rather have been in the ocean than in the classroom."&lt;ref name="puna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punahou.edu/page.cfm?p=1708 |title=Alumni Profile: David Boynton '63 Guardian of the Koke'e Forest|last=Thenabadu|first=Shiyana |publisher=Punahou High School|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boynton graduated from the [[University of California-Santa Barbara]] in 1967 and returned to live in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="legacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kauaiworld.com/articles/2007/02/13/news/news01.txt|title=David Boynton’s legacy to live on|last=Gregg |first=Amanda C. |date=February 12, 2007|publisher=THE GARDEN ISLAND |accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career ===
He was appointed the environmental resource teacher for Kaua`i School District after 18 years as a teacher at Waimea High School.&lt;ref name="legacy" /&gt; In 1992, David was honored by the Koke‘e Natural History Museum with the “One Person Can Make a Difference” award.&lt;ref name="legacy" /&gt; Boynton was instrumental in the creation, by the  state Department of Education, of the Koke‘e Discovery Center in 1994, a "groundbreaking" &lt;ref name="Hon" /&gt; overnight outdoor education facility and student-teacher resource center for fourth and fifth graders in [[Koke'e State Park]], where he served as Director.&lt;ref name="legacy" /&gt; Boynton claimed that Koke'e and surrounding wilderness areas contained many endangered species, over 400 different native plants, and the greatest concentration of ‘single-island endemics’ anywhere, making it the ideal place to teach about biodiversity, sustainability and environmental stewardship.&lt;ref name="puna"/&gt;
The David S. Boynton Educational Grant was established in his memory. Grants, for projects supporting the values Boynton taught, up to a maximum of $1,500 each are awarded to educators or students. The first grant was awarded in 2009.&lt;ref name="grant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegardenisland.com/news/local/article_c5456cc9-94a1-5e98-85fe-259918e261f7.html|title=Stepath receives Boynton grant |date=September 11, 2009|publisher=The Garden Island |accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photography==
Boynton was a much-published author or co-author of photographic essays of Hawaii.  Among his books are:
*'''Na Pali: Images of Kauai's Northwest Shore''' (2007)
*'''Kauai''' (2006)
*'''Flowers-Images from Hawaii's Gardens''' (with his wife, Sue Boynton) (2006)
*'''Kilauea Point and Kauai's National Wildlife Refuges''' (2004)
*'''Kauai, the Garden Island: A Pictorial History of the Commerce and Work of the People ''' (with Chris Cook) (1999)
*'''The Kaua'i Movie Book''' (with Chris Cook) (1996)
*'''Kaua‘i Days''' (2005)
*'''Discover Hawaii’s Forests''' (2000)
*'''Capturing Hawaii:  Kauai''' (1998)
*'''Hawaii Humpback''' Vol. 1 (1980)
*'''Kaua`i:  Ancient Place Names and Their Stories''' (1998) (with Frederick Wichman)
*'''By Wind, By Waves''' (with David L. Eyre) (2000)

In addition, his photographs have been reproduced in countless magazines, newspapers, and posters.  Boynton assisted in the production of the Emmy award-winning 1991 National Geographic Special documentary film, “Hawaii: Strangers in Paradise.”&lt;ref name="cryp"/&gt;

==Death in 2007==
Boynton's body was found in February, 2007 at the foot of a 300-foot cliff on the north face of the remote Miloli'i Valley of the [[Nā Pali Coast State Park|Na Pali]] coast, by all evidence the victim of an accident on the difficult trail. It was reported that Boynton had been alone en route to photograph sea turtles on Miloli'i Beach.&lt;ref name="Hon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2007/Feb/12/ln/FP702120332.html|title=David Boynton was nature buff |last=TenBruggencate |first=Jan |date=February 12, 2007 |publisher=The Honolulu Advertiser|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was familiar with this rugged trail and terrain.  He told a journalist in 2006, "There is a fern that grows in thick mats along these ridges, and I know from personal experience that you can try to push your way through this green layer and wind up stepping off into air."&lt;ref name="Outside"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outside.away.com/outside/culture/200611/unsolved-mysteries-7.html|title=A fateful trek into the Hawaiian jungle|last=Sohn|first=Tim|date=November 2006|publisher=Outside Magazine|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Denny Hall''' is a building on the main campus of the [[University of Washington]], in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States. Built between 1894 and 1895, it is named after [[Arthur A. Denny]].

==Design==
Denny Hall was designed by Charles Saunders and constructed between 1894 and 1895. The brick and sandstone, French Renaissance Revival building is the oldest on the University of Washington's current campus.{{efn|The University of Washington was founded in 1861 at a different location. It moved from its original [[Downtown Seattle]] site in the [[Metropolitan Tract]] to its current campus in the 1890s.&lt;ref name="pi"/&gt;}} A grassy area planted with large, canopy trees - the Denny Yard - sits in front of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Denny Hall Renovation - Draft Site Program Document|date=2007|publisher=[[University of Washington]]|location=[[Seattle, Washington]]|pages=2–4|url=http://opb.washington.edu/sites/default/files/opb/Architecture/ULAC%202007-11-30%20Denny%20Hall%20Site%20Program.pdf|accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Administration Building exterior showing north sides of building, University of Washington, Seattle, May 1, 1901 (PEISER 3).jpeg|thumb|Photograph of the Administration Building in 1901]]
The cornerstone of the building was laid in a July 1894 ceremony attended by a crowd of about 1,000. Originally called the Administration Building, in 1910 it was renamed after Arthur A. Denny, one of the founders of Seattle and an early benefactor of the university. The building was renovated, first in 1957, and a second time beginning in 2008. The $56&amp;nbsp;million renovation of 2008 was stalled by the [[recession of 2008]] but resumed in 2014 and was completed two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Minnick|first1=Benjamin|title=Denny Hall rehab is back on after being stalled by recession|url=http://www.djc.com/news/co/12066489.html|accessdate=December 23, 2016|work=[[Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce]]|date=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=DeMay|first1=Daniel|title=UW's oldest building getting a makeover|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/UW-s-oldest-building-getting-a-makeover-6644111.php|accessdate=December 23, 2016|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sdjc"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Minnick|first1=Benjamin|title=$56M Denny Hall renovation finishing in August, six months ahead of schedule|url=http://www.djc.com/news/co/12089480.html|accessdate=December 23, 2016|work=Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce|date=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dorpat|first1=Paul|title=Now &amp; Then — Denny Hall at University of Washington|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/2565|website=[[HistoryLink]]|publisher=HistoryInk|accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An engraving of Denny Hall is featured on the University of Washington's [[Ceremonial mace|mace]], which is carried and displayed by the Marshal of the University during Convocation and Commencement ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The University Mace|url=http://www.washington.edu/ceremony/tradition/symbols-meanings/university-mace/|website=Office of Ceremonies|publisher=[[University of Washington]]|accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Installed in the cupola of Denny Hall is a {{convert|400|lb|adj=on}}, 1859 bell ("the [[Varsity Bell]]") which is rung once per year, on [[Homecoming]], to ceremonially summon the university's alumni to campus. From 1961 until his death in 2013, [[Brewster Denny]] was responsible for the annual ringing of the Varsity Bell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelley|first1=Peter|title=Brewster Denny: Five decades ringing in UW Homecoming|url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2011/10/28/brewster-denny-five-decades-ringing-in-uw-homecoming/|accessdate=October 28, 2011|work=UW Today|publisher=[[University of Washington]]|date=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Long|first1=Katherine|title=Denny descendant rings UW's historic bell|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/education/2016636985_dennybell29m.html|accessdate=December 23, 2016|work=[[Seattle Times]]|date=October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mennen was the founding president of the [[Voice and Speech Trainers Association]] (VASTA) in 1986, which became an international organization because of her efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vasta.org/mennen-scholarship|title=Mennen Scholarship|website=www.vasta.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mennen continued as a vital member of the VASTA board for twenty years after her retirement. She also served on the board of the [[Indiana]] chapter of the [[National Association of Teachers of Singing]] (NATS) and was a member of the [[Voice Foundation]].&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

==Recognition==

===National recognition===
In 1985, she was given a national award for Leadership and Performance by the University/Resident Theatre Association(U/RTA).

===Mennen Scholarship===
After her retirement in 2001, Purdue Theatre professor Richard Stockton Rand said, "Dorothy has navigated through many generations of Purdue University Theater; assisting as needed, selflessly, in a myriad of capacities without any expectation of recognition at any point in her long and distinguished career." The Dorothy Runk Mennen Scholarship Fund was created at the end of the 2001-2002 Purdue University Theatre season, in order to commemorate and honor the efforts of one of the department's "biggest fans."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.purdueexponent.org/interface/bebop/showstory.php?date=2002%2F08%2F23&amp;section=features&amp;storyid=theaterfacultybenefitprev128|title=The Exponent - features|last=Herkamp|first=Anna|date=August 23, 2002|website=archive.PurdueExponent.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811175353/http://archive.purdueexponent.org/interface/bebop/showstory.php?date=2002%2F08%2F23&amp;section=features&amp;storyid=theaterfacultybenefitprev128|archive-date=2011-08-11|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter to the faculty reads, "Perhaps because my family lived here...I knew this was where I would be. I always saw the faculty and staff as a [[:wikt:gestalt|gestalt]]. it was our personal responsibility to make each one not only look good, but be good as artists and teachers. It was important to make the Theatre live up to its potential with the university and the students. To me, this meant being a part of the university as a whole and to serve it."&lt;ref name=announce /&gt;

The scholarship criteria reads:  The Dorothy Runk Mennen Scholarship was created to honor the spirit of Dorothy Runk Mennen, who has given much of her professional life to the theatre at Purdue University. Her academic work emphasized the importance of speech and voice in the theatre curriculum at Purdue and throughout higher education. Recognizing her impact beyond academics, this scholarship celebrates her unwavering enthusiasm and steadfast encouragement of students to pursue their dreams. It is a merit-based scholarship given to upperclassmen who have made outstanding artistic or craft contributions during their years of studying theatre at Purdue and who have provided notable support and encouragement of their fellow students.

Until 2006, the award was the highest honor which the Governor of Indiana bestows, a personal tribute usually given to those who rendered distinguished service to the state or to the governor.

===Mennen Research/Development Grants===

The VASTA Voice newsletter of September 2009 stated that this award was "named for Mennen, 'the mother of us all.' Dorothy's spirit of encouragement, vision of inclusivity, professionalism, determination and generosity are at the heart of VASTA's mission."&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Eric. "The Dorothy Mennen Research/Development Grants, " Vasta Voice Newsletter, September 2009, {{cite web |url=http://www.vasta.org/newsletter/09/04/index.html#5 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315060501/http://vasta.org/newsletter/09/04/index.html#5 |archivedate=2011-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EarSketch''' is a free educational programming environment. Its core purpose is to teach coding in two widely used languages, [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[JavaScript]], through music composing and remixing. This learning environment was developed first at [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (from 2011) under Prof. Jason Freeman ([[Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology|School of Music]]) and Prof. Brian Magerko ([[School of Literature, Media, and Communication]]).

EarSketch is web-based, which means users can access it with their web-browsers, and with no installation. No account is required to create projects or view existing projects.

EarSketch comprises different elements: a curriculum, a [[digital audio workstation]] (or DAW), a code editor and console, and a sound browser. EarSketch's sound library was created by [[Young Guru]], Jay Z's sound engineer, and famous sound designer [[Richard Devine]].

== Purpose ==
EarSketch has two main goals: to make computer science more engaging for students, and to diversify the population of students interested in computer science.

=== Engagement in computer science at school ===
The US has a shortage of computer science students, not only because not all schools are offering CS classes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Computer Science: Not Just an Elective Anymore|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/02/26/22computer_ep.h33.html|work=Education Week|date=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also because students do not enroll in such classes. A study published in 2009 states: "The percentage of U.S. high school students taking STEM courses has increased over the last 20 years across all STEM disciplines except computer science where it dropped from 25% to 19%".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exploringcs.org/resources/cs-statistics, consulted in November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Considering this, and the fact that all fields of the economy incorporate computing in their operations, EarSketch proposes to motivate students to enroll in CS classes and to pursue CS studies in higher education.
EarSketch attempts to reach this goal by adding a musical side to coding. This strategy is a [[STEAM fields|STEAMs]] approach to education that integrates arts into STEM teaching. A study conducted at Georgia Tech showed statistically significant results in this domain: students who study with EarSketch have been shown to make progress both in content knowledge and attitude towards CS (self-confidence, motivation, intent to persist, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Magerko, B., Freeman, J., McKlin, T., Reilly, M., Livingston, E., Mccoid, S., Crews-Brown, A. (2016), ACM Transactions on Computing Education (TOCE), Vol 16, Issue 4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Participation in computing ===
Today female and minority students in CS classes are, like in other engineering fields, underrepresented (with 22% of female students, 13% of African American students in US classes in 2015&lt;ref&gt;https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/01/30/computer-science-all, consulted in Nov 2016&lt;/ref&gt;). EarSketch has demonstrated success in tackling this issue,&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, J., Magerko, B., Edwards, D., Moore, R., McKlin, T., &amp; Xambó, A. (2015, August). EarSketch: A STEAM approach to broadening participation in computer science principles. In Research in Equity and Sustained Participation in Engineering, Computing, and Technology (RESPECT), 2015 (pp. 1-2). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; partly because of the focus on popular genres of music such as dubstep, and because EarSketch provides a creative, expressive, and authentic environment (since students compose their own music).

== History ==

=== Origin of the name EarSketch ===
The name EarSketch originated in a different project from co-creators Freeman and Magerko focused on collaborative composition and music analysis via drawing. That project never came to fruition, but the idea of collaborative music-making (and the name) remained in a new project focused more on coding and computer science education. Though sketching is no longer a focus of EarSketch, the environment does offer drawing and animation features through P5.

=== First version: Reaper-based desktop application ===
The initial version of EarSketch, released in 2012, was built inside of [[REAPER]], a commercial [[digital audio workstation]] with extensive support for coding via the ReaScript API for Python and the JavaScript plugin authoring architecture. As the project grew, the Reaper-based version of EarSketch was eventually retired due to its dependence on commercial software, the inability of the team to create an integrated user interface to author code, view musical results in the DAW, find sounds, and challenges installing the software in school computer labs.

=== Current version: web application ===
The project then evolved to become a website in 2014. This allowed students to start coding without having to download software. The website uses the [[HTML5 Audio#Web Audio API and MediaStream Processing API|web audio API]] and runs on a private server. New versions are release approximately once per month.
EarSketch is not just a software: the EarSketch team works hand in hand with teachers to build the curriculum, and trains teachers every year in summer professional development workshops.

=== Funding ===
EarSketch received funding from the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) (CNS #1138469, DRL #1417835, DUE #1504293, and DRL #1612644), the Scott Hudgens Family Foundation, the [[Arthur Blank|Arthur M. Blank]] Family Foundation, and the Google Inc. Fund of Tides Foundation.

== Sections ==
EarSketch is a [[web application]], and when opening a session, users see different sections: the curriculum, the code editor, the console, the Digital Audio Workstation, and the browser.  
[[File:ESsections.png|thumb|1000px|center|alt=EarSketch screenshot with sections|EarSketch sections]]

=== The curriculum ===
The curriculum is aligned with AP Computer Science Principles but can be used in any introductory programming course.
&lt;br /&gt;
Each chapter has several sections, a summary, a quiz, screencasts, and associated slides. The curriculum is positioned in the right side of the window. It is a textbook for EarSketch that includes chapters about major computing principles, Python and JavaScript, as well as an introduction to computer science. The curriculum is divided in the following sections:
* '''3 units''', namely:
** Unit 1 is an introduction to EarSketch, computing and to basic musical concepts (tempo and pitch, effects...),
** Unit 2 focuses on loops, string operations, musical form and beat,
** Unit 3 introduces conditionals, data structures, and randomness,
* Optional '''more in-depth chapters''', 
* The [[API]] '''documentation''', which describes all the functions that are specific to EarSketch, 
* A '''university-level introduction''' to computer science section, 
* '''Teacher materials''', which include lesson plans, examples, slides, and evaluation tools.
* '''An [[Hour of code]] tutorial''': Hour of code is a worldwide initiative to engage students in computer science, by providing 60 minute-long ludic introduction tutorials (for instance with [[Minecraft]] or [[Frozen (2013 film)|frozen]] components).&lt;ref&gt;https://code.org/learn, consulted in November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This particular tutorial is an introduction to computer science where students compose their first song with EarSketch. 
&lt;br /&gt;
The units are divided into chapters. Each chapter has several sections, a summary, a quizz, and associated slides. The curriculum contains Python and JavaScript example code that can be pasted into the '''code editor'''.

=== The code editor and console ===
EarSketch's '''code editor''' is located in the window at the center of the page. When the code is executed, it will create the music in the Digital Audio Workstation. If there is an error in the code, a message explaining the error will appear in the '''console''', located under the code editor.

=== The digital audio workstation ===
A [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) is a tool used by a majority of music producers which helps manipulate audio samples (or audio files), add effects, and accomplish other tasks in the composition process. EarSketch's DAW is located in the top center section, above the code editor. It contains tracks: each line is a track, and corresponds to an instrument. With code commands, the user will add sound samples in these tracks, as well as effects, such as volume changes, reverberation, delay, etc. 
When the code is executed, the DAW will be filled with the sound samples, and the user can play the music they just coded.

=== The browser: scripts and sounds ===
In order to compose music, EarSketch coders can use samples. Audio samples are located in the '''sound browser''', in the left window, which allows for sound file search, and personal sound file upload. 
In the left section, users can also show the '''script browser'''. A script is a code file, and different scripts will create different music in the DAW.

== Main feature examples ==
Although the code written in the code editor will be either in Python or JavaScript, there are EarSketch-specific functions that allow for the user to accomplish music related tasks. Here are some examples:
* One of the basic functions of EarSketch is '''fitMedia()''', which places a sample sound in the Digital Audio Workstation.
* Another important function is '''MakeBeat()''', that takes as input a [[String (computer science)|string]] and a file name. The string corresponds to times when the file should be played, sustained, or when there should be silence. This is a common way of creating percussive lines in music programming languages. For instance, in EarSketch, '0' indicates that the file should play, then '-' means a silence, and '+' means keep playing the sample. So if we use the string "0-000+++", it means play the audio file on the first sixteenth note, then there is a silence, then the file is played three times in a row, and finally, the file keeps playing through the three last sixteenth notes.
* Another example would be '''setEffect()''', which adds effects to a track. Effects are common in Digital Audio Workstations as they are an indispensable element of music production. Here are some examples of effects:
** [[Loudness|Volume]]: this modifies the loudness of a track. It can be used to emphasize a particular track compared to the rest of the instruments. It can also be used to fade in and fade out the music to have a smoother beginning and end. 
** [[Reverberation|Reverb]]: this makes the samples sound like they were being played in a room that echoes the sounds. 
** [[Delay (audio effect)|Delay]]: this produces an artificial echo.
** [[Filter (signal processing)|Frequency filters]]: these will modify the sound by either attenuating or highlighting certain frequencies.

'''Employment and Social Development Canada''' ('''ESDC'''; {{lang-fr|Emploi et Développement social Canada}}) is a [[Ministry (government department)|department]] of the [[Government of Canada]] responsible for social programs and the labour market at the federal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Back to Work Back to Work: Canada Improving the Re-employment Prospects of Displaced Workers: Improving the Re-employment Prospects of Displaced Workers|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mV4cCgAAQBAJ|publisher = OECD Publishing|date = 2015-07-07|isbn = 9789264233454|language = en|last = OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Creation ===
The Department of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) was created in December 2003, when [[Human Resources Development Canada]] was split into two separate departments: HRSDC and [[Social Development Canada]]. Though they continued to share many common services and operations, HRSDC was to focus on workforce-related aspects of the former HRDC portfolio, while SDC was to focus on social support programs for children, families and seniors. The split was given formal legal effect when the ''Department of Humans Resources and Skills Development Act'' and the ''Department of Social Development Act'' were [[Enactment of a bill|enacted]] in July 2005.

=== Recombined ===
Upon taking office in February 2006, the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] government of [[Stephen Harper]] announced it would recombine the two departments, and through a series of [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] Social Development Canada was folded into HRSDC.  Though a Department of Social Development remains in effect in legal terms, it no longer exists in any real sense.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

From 2006 to 2008, Social Development's preceding role was reflected by [[style (manner of address)|styling]] the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development as the "Minister of Human Resources and Social Development", and by changing the department's applied title to "Human Resources and Social Development Canada". This practice ended in late 2008 when the title was changed to "Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development."  The post was later referred to as "Minister of Employment and Social Development" when the department was renamed.

On November 4, 2015 the department underwent Machinery of Government Changes which saw the employment responsibilities transfer to the Labour Minister resulting in the newly re-titled [[Minister of Employment, Workforce and Labour]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/index.asp?lang=eng&amp;page=docs&amp;doc=mog-ag-eng.htm, Machinery of Government Changes&lt;/ref&gt; The Social Development aspects were then shaped into the [[Minister of Families, Children and Social Development]]. The [[Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities]] is now tasked with handling the file on persons with disabilities.

==Sub-agencies, programs and activities ==
Sub-agencies of ESDC include:
*[[Service Canada]]
**[[Service Canada Centres for Youth]]
*[[Student loans in Canada|Canada Student Loans Program]]
*[[Unemployment_benefits#Canada|Canada Employment Insurance Commission ]]
*[[Canada Pension Plan]]
*National Seniors Council
*[[Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program]]
*[[Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (Canada)|Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service]]
*[[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]]
*[[Canada Industrial Relations Board]]

ESDC delivers $87 billion in programs and services and has approximately 24,000 employees. Approximately 19,000 of those employees work under the [[Service Canada]] banner.

== Officials and structure ==
;* [[Minister of Families, Children and Social Development]]: [[The Honourable|Hon.]] [[Jean-Yves Duclos]]

;* [[Minister of Employment, Workforce and Labour]]: [[The Honourable|Hon.]] [[Patty Hajdu]]

;* [[Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities]] : [[The Honourable|Hon.]] [[Kirsty Duncan]]

== Controversies ==

=== 2012/2013 privacy breach ===

On January 11, 2013, Minister [[Diane Finley]] announced that a hard drive containing information of 583,000 student loan borrowers had been lost from a Canada Student Loans Program (CSLP)/HRSDC office in Gatineau, Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.gc.ca/web/article-eng.do?mthd=tp&amp;crtr.page=1&amp;nid=714639&amp;crtr.tp1D=4&lt;/ref&gt;  Borrowers who registered a loan between 2000–2006 were potentially affected.  The information on the hard drive contained full names, [[Social Insurance Number|Social Insurance Numbers]], contact information, and loan balances.  The hard drive also contained information on 250 HRSDC employees.  Concerns of privacy breaches and identity theft led to the filing of three class-action suits against the federal government on behalf of the affected students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-faces-third-class-action-lawsuit-over-student-loan-privacy-breach/article7531526/|title=Ottawa faces third class-action lawsuit over student-loan privacy breach|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2013, the Office of the [[Privacy Commissioner of Canada]] stated that a formal investigation had been launched.  The stated outcome of this investigation was to provide information to organizations and individuals to improve privacy protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.priv.gc.ca/information/pub/faqs_hrsdc_e.asp|title=Information for individuals regarding the loss of the HRSDC hard drive - January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCMP was notified but is waiting for the outcome of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada's investigation to do their own investigation.

This incident has become known as "1 in 60", representing the ratio of affected individuals to the Canadian population as a whole.

The '''European Schools''' ({{lang-la|Schola Europaea}}) is a network of private-authority schools, which emphasise a multilingual and multicultural pedagogical approach to the teaching of nursery, primary and secondary students, leading to the [[European Baccalaureate]] as their [[School leaving qualification|secondary leaving qualification]].

The first European School, founded in [[Luxembourg]], in 1953, had the objective of providing an education to the children of employees of the institutions of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]- a forerunner of today's [[European Union]]. Originally, a private initiative of employees of the ECSC, the concept attracted the attention of EU founding father, [[Jean Monnet]] as capturing the spirit of the post-[[World War II|war]] effort to reconcile and [[European integration|integrate]] [[Europe]].

As of 2017, there are thirteen European Schools located in six EU member states in close proximity to European institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eursc.eu/en/European-Schools/locations|title=Locations of the European Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=eursc.eu|publisher=Office of the Secretary General of the European Schools|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Schools are neither EU bodies, nor under the full jurisdiction of the individual [[Member state of the European Union|member states of the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gruber|first=Joachim|date=2011-06-01|title=European schools: A subject of International Law Integrated into the European Union|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/157237411x587388|journal=International Organizations Law Review|volume=8|issue=1|pages=175–196|doi=10.1163/157237411x587388|issn=1572-3747|subscription=yes|quote=Despite their name, the "European Schools" are not a European Union institution, but an independent, autonomous subject of international law.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are instead administered and financed through the international organisation "The European Schools", established by means of an intergovernmental [[treaty]], the 1957 Statute of the European School, since repealed and replaced by the 1994 Convention Defining the Statute of the European Schools. All [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]], as well as the EU itself, and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom) are party to this agreement. The Schools are legally recognised in all participating jurisdictions as public bodies.

Since 2005, upon a recommendation of the [[European Parliament]], the title of an "Accredited European School" has been available for schools under national jurisdiction, which have been approved, by the [[European Schools#The Board of Governors|Board of Governors]] of the European Schools, to offer the European Schools' curriculum and the European Baccalaureate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eursc.eu/en/Accredited-European-Schools/faq|title=Accredited European Schools - FAQ|last=|first=|date=|website=eursc.eu|publisher=Office of the Secretary General of the European Schools|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, there are thirteen Accredited European Schools located in eleven EU countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eursc.eu/en/Accredited-European-Schools/locations|title=Locations of the Accredited European Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=eursc.eu|publisher=Office of the Secretary General of the European Schools|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Foundation: An intergovernmental enterprise ===
Following the establishment of the institutions of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) in [[Luxembourg]], in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_seats_of_the_institutions_of_the_european_union-en-cd672879-aeb1-4cad-a0c1-9e4ff75ff660.html|title=The seats and institutions of the European Union|last=|first=|date=8 July 2016|website=cvce.eu|access-date=19 August 2017|quote=At the Conference of the Founding States of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) held on 23 July 1952, Luxembourg was chosen as the provisional place of work for its institutions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became apparent that it was necessary to provide an education to the children of the officials of those institutions in their [[mother tongues]]. The lack of such provisions posed challenges in building an administration that reflected the diverse makeup of the ECSC's [[Inner Six|six founding member states]], discouraging potential employees who heralded from outside the jurisdiction in which the institutions were based from relocating with their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Ronsheim|first=Sally Bober|title=A Study of Two International Cultural Schools in Western Europe|date=15 February 1967|degree=Ph.D.|publisher=[[New York University]]|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/302242827?accountid=13042|doi=|format=}} pp. 294-295. "The problem was first recognized at the end of 1952 when the families of the first functionaries of the European Coal and Steel Community settled in Luxembourg. An extremely complex and delicate problem arose; that of providing the kind of instruction needed for youngsters originating from five different countries. It was necessary to assure without discrimination, a way for them to follow their national studies within a multinational framework. The limited number of students from each country did not allow for the creation of as many schools as nationalities represented. A new kind of school had to be organized to allow for cultural diversity and the special needs of the Community population."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, employees of the ECSC established an association, financed by the [[High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community|High Authority of the ECSC]], for the purpose of founding a school in Luxembourg providing nursery and primary education to the children of the institutions' officials. The school begun to operate on 4 October 1953, with teachers recruited and paid by the association.

However, by the spring of 1954, it was apparent that the solution was inadequate, with the school unable to provide a secondary education to its enrolees. The President of the High Authority of the ECSC, [[Jean Monnet]], invited representatives of the [[education minister]]s of the [[Inner Six|six founding member states of the ECSC]] to Luxembourg for discussions on a school with [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] status. The member state representatives transformed themselves into a [[Board of governors|Board of Governors]], who would oversee the establishment of a such a school. It was agreed that teaching staff would be seconded from the member states, who would continue to pay their salary, and that salaries would be harmonised by means of an additional supplement. On 12 October 1954, the first two years of the secondary school began to operate.

On 12 April 1957, the governments of the six ECSC member states signed, and later subsequently ratified, the Statute of the European School, which took the form of an [[international treaty]]. Under Article 6 of the Statute, the European School was to have the status of a public institution in the law of each of the contracting parties and was to have [[legal personality]] to the extent requisite for the attainment of its objectives. The organs of the school were to be a Board of Governors, which would have executive authority over the School, a Boards of Inspectors, an Administrative Board and a [[Head teacher]]. Article 8 provided that the Board of Governors of the European School was to consist of the "[[Minister (government)|Minister]] or Ministers of each contracting party whose responsibilities include national education and/or external cultural relations", with the Board able to confer a position to a representative of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community, as per Article 27.

=== The spread of the European Schools ===
Following the foundation of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom) in 1957 and the establishment of the institutions of those Communities in various places, other European Schools were set up in [[Brussels]] and [[Mol, Belgium|Mol]], [[Belgium]] in 1958, in [[Varese]], [[Italy]] in 1960, [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]] in 1962, in [[Bergen]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] in 1963, and a second school in Brussels  in 1976. In order to facilitate the setting-up of those new schools and to provide them with a legal basis, the governments of the member states signed on 13 April 1962 in Luxembourg a Protocol on the setting-up of European Schools with reference to the 1957 Statute of the European School.

In 1967, the institutions of the EEC, ECSC and Euratom were merged to form the [[European Communities]]. Consequently, the three organisations were represented on the Board of Governors by the [[European Commission]] of the European Communities, the successor institution to the High Authority of the ECSC. Taking advantage of the powers conferred to it by the 1957 Statute, the Board of Governors signed an agreement with the [[European Patent Organisation]] - a separate intergovernmental organisation - in December 1975 allowing for the creation, in 1977, of a European School in [[Munich]], Germany for the education and instruction together of children of its staff. In 1973, the first [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]] of the European Communities saw the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland accede to the 1957 Statute. In 1978, a European School was established at [[Culham]], UK in order to serve the children of the staff posted to the [[Joint European Torus]] Joint Undertaking (JET), supervised by Euratom, for the development of a common [[Fusion power|nuclear fusion]] programme. By 1986, following the enlargement of the European Communities to include [[Greece]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], the Schools were obliged to provide an education to the students of officials originating from the 12 EC member states.

=== Coping with EU enlargement ===
Pursuant to the [[Maastricht Treaty|incorporation of the European Communities]] into the [[European Union]] in 1993, and envisioning the [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement in membership of the EU]] following the end of the [[Cold War]], it was decided that the legal and organisational framework of the Schools needed an overhaul. On 1 October 2002, the Convention Defining the Statute of the European Schools, originally signed in 1994, came into effect repealing and replacing the 1957 Statute of the European School and its accompanying 1962 Protocol. Following the accession of [[Croatia]] to the EU in 2013, the 1994 Convention includes amongst its contracting parties all 28 EU member states, as well as the EU itself, and Euratom.

== Principles and objectives ==
The historical significance of the first European School, founded a mere 12 years after the end of [[World War II]], was not lost on its architects. Children, whose parents had fought on opposite sides of the conflict, would not only be taught together, but, as per the curriculum of the School, learn history and geography in a foreign language and from a foreign point of view.  "May the Europe of the European schools definitively take the place of the Europe of the war cemeteries," [[René Mayer]], head of the ECSC proclaimed upon the opening of a new custom building for the School on [[N51 road (Luxembourg)|Boulevard de la Foire]] in Luxembourg, on 11 December 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n12/peter-pomerantsev/diary|title=Diary|last1=Pomerantsev|first1=Peter|authorlink=Peter Pomerantsev|date=16 June 2016|website=London Review of Books|pages=46–47|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment is echoed in the words inscribed in Latin on parchment and sealed in  each of the European Schools' foundation stones. Translated into English, it reads:
{{Quote|text=Educated side by side, untroubled from infancy by divisive prejudices, acquainted with all that is great and good in the different cultures, it will be borne in upon them as they mature that they belong together. Without ceasing to look to their own lands with love and pride, they will become in mind Europeans, schooled and ready to complete and consolidate the work of their fathers before them, to bring into being a united and thriving Europe.|sign=|source=Marcel Decombis, member of the cabinet of [[Jean Monnet]] and Head of the European School, Luxembourg between 1953 and 1960}}

The [[curriculum]] is common to all thirteen schools and is centrally controlled by the [[European Schools#The Boards of Inspectors|Board of Inspectors]] and the [[European Schools#The Board of Governors|Board of Governors]].

=== Secondary level ===
Compulsory subjects for Years 1–7 of the secondary school:
* First language (normally mother tongue)
* Second language (Usually one of English, French or German, with some schools providing a local language such as Spanish, Italian, Danish or Dutch as alternate option)
* Mathematics
* History (instructed in second language from Year 3)
* Geography (instructed in second language from Year 3)
* Ethics/religion (instructed in second language from Year 3)
* Physical education (instruction in second language is possible from year 3)
Compulsory for Years 1–3 of the secondary school:
*Art 
*Music
Compulsory subjects for Years 1–5 of the secondary school:
*Third language (any EU official language, as long as a minimum number of students choose it in the same school) 
*Natural sciences: Physics, Chemistry and Biology (usually combined for Years 1-3)
Compulsory subjects for Years 6–7 of the secondary school:
* Philosophy
* Physics and/or Chemistry and/or Biology (at least one science subject is obligatory)
Optional subjects:
* ICT (instructed in second language) and Latin in Year 3
*Economics (instructed in second language), Music, or a Fourth and Fifth language in Years 4–7

=== Foreign language education ===
All modern foreign languages offered are taught using the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]] where the lessons are taught in the language being learned, and the use of the student's native tongue is discouraged. These foreign languages lessons are shared with pupils from other language streams. The idea is to encourage the pupils to use the language they are learning as a means of crossing the communication barrier between themselves and pupils from other language streams. From Year 3 onwards of the secondary school, History and Geography as well as other secondary subjects such as Music are taught in each student's second language. Many of the pupils find themselves in a foreign country, so are surrounded by a foreign language. Some pick it up through [[language immersion]], hence some lessons are taught in the national language of the host country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eursc.eu/index.php?id=132id=132&amp;l=2 "European Schools Principles and objectives"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203221654/http://www.eursc.eu/index.php?id=132id=132&amp;l=2 |date=3 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Baccalaureate===
{{main|European Baccalaureate}}
The [[European Baccalaureate]] is the [[School leaving qualification|leaving certification]] of the European Schools, and should be distinguished from the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) and the baccalaureates of various national systems. It is a two-year course assessing the performance of students in the subjects taught in Years 6–7, and culminating in a final series exams taken at the end of Year 7. As per the multilingual ethos of the Schools, certain subjects are instructed and assessed in each student's respectvie second language.  Details of the examinations are set out in the Annex of the Statute of the European School and in the regulations for the European Baccalaureate.

Those students undertaking the European Baccalaureate are required to study at least 8 and up to a maximum of 11 academic subjects, in addition to physical education and moral/religion, with different weightings according to the course choices made when commencing the Baccaluareate.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/DCSF-Euro_Baccalaureate.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The final mark is calculated as a percentage, where 60% is the minimum for a pass.

The European Baccalaureate is administered and directly supervised by an external examining board appointed annually by the Board of Governors. The examining board consists of up to three representatives of each member state, who must satisfy the conditions governing the appointment of equivalent examining boards in their respective countries. It is presided over by a senior university educator appointed by each member state in turn, assisted by a member of the Board of Inspectors of the Schools.

Article 5 (2) of the Statute provides that holders of the Baccalaureate shall:

*enjoy, in the Member State of which they are nationals, all the benefits attaching to the possession of the diploma or certificate awarded at the end of secondary school education in that country; and
*be entitled to seek admission to any university in the territory of any Member State on the same terms as nationals of that Member State with equivalent qualifications.

The first awards of the European Baccalaureate were made in 1959.

==Common extra-curricula activities and events==
Sports teams of the European Schools compete in the biennial Eurosport event, with the Schools alternating as hosts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euroschool.lu/eses2015/Documents/Eurosport-handbook/2014-09-D-49-en-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, students of the Schools have the opportunity to take part in the annual European Schools Science Composium, the winners of which represent the European Schools in the [[European Union Contest for Young Scientists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euroschool.lu/esss/|title=European School Science Symposium|last=|first=|date=|website=euroschool.lu|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Schools also cooperate to take advantage of their unique relationship to EU institutions, to provide students on an annual basis with the opportunity to take part in political simulations of EU meetings, held on the premises of the institutions themselves. Students get the opportunity to role-play as delegates of EU member state governments in a Model [[European Council]], MEPs in a Model [[European Parliament]], or international journalists covering the meetings.

The federation of student representatives of the Schools, [[European Schools#The Pupils.27 Committees and CoSup|CoSup]], organises a "Europarty", held in a different European city each academic year, and open to any student of the European Schools over 16 years of age to attend.

== Organs ==

=== Board of Governors ===
The Board of Governors is the common executive body of the European Schools, determining educational, administrative and financial matters. When it is not in session, its powers are exercised by its officially appointed Secretary-General.

==== Membership ====
The [[Board of directors|governing board]] is composed of the [[Education minister|ministers of education]] of each of the [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]], normally represented by senior civil servants from the ministries of education or foreign affairs, together with the representative of the [[European Commission]], representing the [[European Union|EU]] and [[European Atomic Energy Community|Euratom]], and the representative of the [[European Patent Office]]. A representative designated by the Staff Committee and a representative of the parents designated by the Parents’ Associations are also members of the Board of Governors.

==== Preparatory Committees ====
Matters to be discussed by the Board of Governors first make their way through a range of preparatory committees, the most important of which are the Joint Teaching Committee and the Budgetary Committee. The Joint Teaching Committee gathers Inspectors and directors, together with representatives of teachers, parents and pupils and a representative of the European Commission and the European Patent Office. It examines proposals concerning the organisation and curricula of the schools. The Budgetary Committee, likewise, gathers finance officials from the EU member states, together with representatives of the European Commission and European Patent Office to examine the financial implications of educational proposals and the budgets of individual schools and of the General Secretariat in Brussels.

=== Boards of Inspectors ===
Supervision of the education provided by the European Schools is conducted by two Boards of Inspectors, one for the primary and nursery sections and one for the secondary section. One Inspector from each of the 28 EU member states sits on each Board.

=== Administrative Boards ===
Each European School has an Administrative Board responsible for the day-to-day administration and functioning of the each respective School. Chaired by the Secretary-General of the European Schools. Its other members are the director of the School, a representative of the European Commission, two elected representatives of the teachers, two representatives of the Parents’ Association, a representative of the administrative and socially staff and, at the European School of Munich, a representative of the European Patent Office. Bodies which have signed an agreement with a school and have at least 20 pupils on roll also have the right to be represented on the Administrative Board.

=== Directors (Head teachers) and teachers ===
Each head teacher is appointed by the Board of Governors for nine years. There are generally two deputy-head teachers, one for the secondary section and one for the primary and nursery sections. They are also appointed for nine years. Head and deputy-head teachers are appointed directly by the Board of Governors. All full time teachers are seconded by their national governments for a period up to nine years.

=== Staff Committees ===
Each European School elects, annually, two representatives of the teaching staff (one primary, one secondary) to form a European School Staff Committee which is represented on the Board of Governors, in the Preparatory Committees and on the Administrative Board of each School. In 2016, these roles were enlarged to include Locally Recruited Teachers (LRT)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eursc.eu/BasicTexts/2016-05-D-11-en-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and two further representatives are elected annually. These representatives do not have voting rights, however they are able to attend meetings and represent the interests of LRTs vis-a-vis the School.

=== Complaints Board ===
In the European Schools system, the Complaints Board, an independent administrative court, represents the judiciary, owing to the Schools' unique intergovernmental legal basis.

===Parents' Associations===

Common to each European School, the respective Parents' Associations are responsible for overseeing the provision of school transportation, the running of canteen services and extra-curricula activities. Each Parents' Association is open to any parent or legal guardian who has a child enrolled in the Schools, and possesses a place on the Administrative Board of their respective European School. Via a body which federates all the Parents' Associations of the European Schools, INTERPARENTS, they participate in meetings of the Board of Governors of the European Schools, enabling them a voice in intergovernmental meetings which set the future direction of the organisation as a whole. Each Parents' Association is also a member of the ''Groupe Unitaire pour la Défense des Ecoles Européennes'' (GUDEE), which groups Parents’Associations, Trades-Unions and other organisations possessing an interest in the future of the European Schools together.

===Pupils' Committees and CoSup===

Regulations agreed by the Board of Governors of the European Schools recognise the right of the students of each School to organise and represent themselves in the administration and functioning of the Schools via a Pupils' Committee. Each European Schools' Pupils' Committee is democratically elected at the start of each academic year, headed by a president.

The Pupils' Committees of the European Schools are federated via CoSup, an acronym formed from its French title, '''''Co'''nseil '''Sup'''érieur des Elèves''. Each Pupils' Committee elects two representatives to send to meetings of CoSup. Accredited European Schools may also send representatives. As of 2006, CoSup is recognised by the Board of Governors of the European Schools as an official body. It is able to represent common student interests on the European Schools' Joint Teaching Committee. CoSup possesses a common fund, able to financially support represented Pupils' Committees, when necessary. Amongst other duties, CoSup is responsible for organising the annual Europarty, held in a different European city each year, and open to any student of the European Schools over the age of 16 to attend. CoSup meets four times per academic year and utilises a Qualified Majority Voting system, endowing each European School represented a number of votes proportional to its share of the total number of students enrolled across all European Schools. Each School receives an equal vote weighting for matters concerning the functioning of CoSup, such as its presidential elections, which occur at the last meeting of each academic year.

There are thirteen European Schools, found in eight municipalities, across six EU countries, in close proximity to [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institutions]], or in the case of the European School, Munich, the [[European Patent Organisation]]. There are already five European Schools in Belgium (four in [[Brussels]] and one in [[Mol, Belgium|Mol]]) and discussions are currently being held about building a fifth school in Brussels at an undetermined future date. The [[European School, Culham]] closed on 31 August 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5623">The '''Eurydice Network''' is the Education Information Network in Europe. It consists of a coordinating European Unit and a series of national units; its aim is to provide policy makers in the [[member states of the European Union]] with up-to-date and reliable information on which to base policy decisions in the Education field.

Specific studies and reports are available free of charge on the [http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/index_en.php Eurydice website], along with [https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/index.php?title=Home Eurypedia], a comprehensive online Encyclopedia on national education systems in Europe.

==Origins==
The Eurydice Network is the Education Information Network in Europe. It was established by the [[European Commission]] in 1980, following a request by the then European Community Ministers of Education in their resolutions of 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Resolution of the Council and of the Ministers of Education, meeting within the Council, of 9 February 1976 comprising an action programme in the field of education , paras 8–12; [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:41976X0219:EN:HTML]&lt;/ref&gt;

In those early days of [[Education in the European Union|Education policy within the European Community]] there was considerable suspicion among some Ministers of Education of what the [[European Commission]] might do; their original action programme thus limited actions at European level to those that could not impinge on  national sovereignty: this included the exchange of information and documentation. The Commission established the European Eurydice Unit directly; and following some years' negotiations, the network held its first meeting in 1980.

==Structure and evolution ==
The network consisted originally of a European Unit and one or more units set up by Education Ministries in each of the then 9 [[member states of the European Union]]. These national units were normally located within Ministries responsible for Education, although in some cases (e.g., England) they were outsourced to research or documentation bodies. In federal countries (such as Germany or Belgium) the more than one unit was needed to respond to the structure of education in the country: thus, in Germany one national Eurydice Unit was established inside the documentation service of the Federal Ministry for Education; and another in the ''Conference of State Ministers of Education'', which brings together the Education Ministers of the federal states.

This structure has continued: the addition of more EU Member States with successive [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargements of the European Union]] has in each case been preceded by participation of the new country within the Eurydice network. At the end of 2006 there were 35 'national' units in 31 countries. Since 2014, the network consists of [http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/contacts_national_units_en.php 40 national units] based in all 36 countries participating in the EU's Erasmus+ programme (EU Member States, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the  Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Montenegro, Serbia, Turkey, Liechtenstein and Norway). Eurydice is now co-ordinated and managed by the [http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/index_en.php EU Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency] in Brussels, which drafts its studies and provides a range of online resources.

==Areas of Work==
Eurydice prepares and publishes a range of studies and material on all levels of education, from preprimary to tertiary and adult education, including: 
*[https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/index.php?title=Home Eurypedia], the European Encyclopedia on national Education Systems and other [http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/eurybase_en.php national descriptions]– e.g. Structures of Education and Training Systems;
*[http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/thematic_studies_en.php Comparative thematic studies] of topical issues in European education, such as higher education, the teaching profession, the  teaching of languages and science, the integration of immigrant children or education for citizenship;  
*[http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/key_data_en.php Indicators] – e.g.  Key Data on Education in Europe and subject-based Key Data on higher education, language teaching, and information and communication technology;  
*[http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/tools_en.php Facts and Figures] – e.g. School and academic calendars and Teachers' and School Heads' Salaries and Allowances in Europe.

==Coordination with other bodies==
Eurydice cooperates closely with several European and international organisations:
* [[Eurostat]] (Statistical Office of the European Communities)
* [http://crell.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ CRELL (Centre for Research on Lifelong Learning)]
* Cedefop ([[European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training]])
* ETF ([[European Training Foundation]])

The European Unit of Eurydice also supports the [[European Commission]] in the work it undertakes with international organisations such as the [[Council of Europe]], [[OECD]] (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)  and [[UNESCO]] (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization)

[[File:Gary Chapman.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Chapman speaking at a conference in 2010.]]

The first of many books promoting the above concept was ''[[The Five Love Languages|The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate]]'', first published in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Shinn Turner, [https://www.salisburypost.com/2018/01/28/dr-gary-chapman-speaks-at-chamber-breakfast-all-you-need-is-love/ Dr. Gary Chapman speaks at Chamber breakfast: 'All you need is love'], salisburypost.com, USA, January 28, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The book has sold over 11 million copies in English; having been translated into 49 other languages and the 2015 edition consistently ranks in the top 100 sellers on [[Amazon.com]], ranking in the top 50 as of February, 2007.  It also consistently ranks in the top 5 books on the ''New York Times'' bestsellers list, claiming the #1 spot at times.

He is perhaps best known for his concept of "Five Love Languages", helping people express and receive love as expressed through one of five languages: [[Praise|words of affirmation]], [[quality time]], [[Gift|receiving gifts]], [[Selfless service|acts of service]], or [[Haptic communication|physical touch]]. Chapman argues that while each of these languages is enjoyed to some degree by all people, a person will usually speak one primary language, but all are important and can be ranked after taking the love language profile.  He has also authored the Five Love Language concept books for parents of children and teenagers, single adults, and a special version for men.

'''Hands-free computing''' is any [[computer configuration]] where a [[user (computing)|user]] can interface without the use of their [[hand]]s, an otherwise common requirement of [[human interface device]]s such as the [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] and [[computer keyboard|keyboard]]. Hands-free computing is important because it is useful to both able and [[disabled]] users. [[Speech recognition]] systems can be [[trained]] to recognize specific [[command (computing)|commands]] and upon confirmation of correctness instructions can be given to systems without the use of hands. This may be useful while driving or to an inspector or engineer in a factory environment. Likewise disabled persons may find hands-free computing important in their everyday lives. Just like [[visually impaired]] have found computers useful in their lives.&lt;ref name=WearableComp&gt;{{cite conference |last=Burgy |first=Christian |title=Speech-Controlled Wearables: Are We There, Yet? |booktitle=2nd International Forum on Applied Wearable Computing |pages=17–27 |publisher=VDE VERLAG |date=March 17–18, 2005 |location=Switzerland |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1xEG7LzhtIsC|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can range from using the tongue, lips, mouth, or movement of the head to [[voice activated]] interfaces utilizing speech recognition software and a microphone or [[bluetooth]] technology.

Examples of available hands-free computing devices include mouth-operated [[joystick]] types such as the TetraMouse, the QuadJoy, the Jouse2, the QuadStick, and the IntegraMouse, [[camera]] based [[head tracking]] systems such as SmartNav, Tracker Pro, [[FreeTrack]], HeadMouse Extreme, HeadMaster and KinesicMouse,&lt;ref&gt;KinesicMouse: a [[Kinect]] based camera mouse for hands-free computing detecting more than 50 facial expressions http://kinesicmouse.com&lt;/ref&gt; and speech recognition specialized for disabilities such as [[Voice Finger]]. The joystick types require no physical connections to the user and enhances the user's feeling of independence. Camera types require targets mounted on the user, usually with the help of a [[caregiver]], that are sensed by the camera and associated software. Camera types are sensitive to ambient lighting and the mouse pointer may drift and inaccuracies result from head movements not intended to be mouse movements. Other examples of hands-free mice are units that are operated using switches that may be operated [[footmouse|by the feet]] (or other parts of the body), such as the NoHands Mouse and the switch-adapted TetraMouse. Speech recognition specialized for disabilities and hands-free computing focus more on low-level control of the keyboard and mouse than on usual areas like dictation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14231">An '''Income Share Agreement''' (or '''ISA''') is a United States financial structure in which an individual or organization provides something of value (often a fixed amount of money) to a recipient who, in exchange, agrees to pay back a percentage of his/her income for a fixed number of years. ISAs have gained prominence as a proposed alternative to the [[Student financial aid in the United States|traditional student loan system]] in [[Higher education in the United States|American higher education]], and a number of private companies now offer ISAs for a variety of purposes, including as a funding source for college tuition.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/10/22/what-would-happen-if-investments-in-people-succeeded/|title=What Would Happen if Investments in People Succeeded}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISAs are often considered to be less financially risky to a borrower than a traditional private [[student loan]]. In the UK this type of agreement is called a "Human Capital Contract" and is currently being assessed by the FCA (UK financial regulator) as a more affordable alternative to debt for post-graduation student funding.
==Characteristics==
Income Share Agreements are characterized by a percentage share of future income. They function like non-voting shares in a company where the individual student is treated like a company.  In the American system, this usually involves the investor transferring funds to an individual in exchange for a fixed percentage of his/her future income &lt;ref name="aei"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/files/2014/02/26/-investing-in-value-sharing-in-risk-financing-higher-education-through-inome-share-agreements_083548906610.pdf|title=Investing in Value, Sharing Risk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jainfamilyinstitute.org/#isa|title=Home|website=Jain Family Institute|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other features of Income Share Agreements could include a) a fixed length of time for the income sharing b) an income exemption where the borrower does not owe anything below a certain income, and c) a buyout option, where the borrower pays a fee to exit the contract. Some ISA investors offer different terms to different students based on their predicted likelihood of success, while others offer the same terms to all students. Potential groups of investors could include for-profit companies, altruistic non-profits, alumni groups, educational institutions, and local, state, or federal governments.&lt;ref name="aei"/&gt;

==History==

[[Milton Friedman]] originally proposed the concept in 1955, in his essay [http://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/330T/350kPEEFriedmanRoleOfGovttable.pdf The Role of Government in Education], in which he argued that students should be funded through an "equity investment" such that:

{{quote|[Investors] could "buy" a share in an individual’s earning prospects: to advance him the funds needed to finance his training on condition that he agree to pay the lender a specified fraction of his future earnings. In this way, a lender would get back more than his initial investment from relatively successful individuals, which would compensate for the failure to recoup his original investment from the unsuccessful.}}

In the 1970s [[Yale University]] attempted a modified form of Friedman’s proposal with several cohorts of undergraduate students. At Yale, instead of making individual contracts for a fixed number of years, all members of the cohort agreed to pay back a percentage of earnings until the entire cohort’s balance had been paid off. However, the system left students frustrated that they were paying more than their fair share, by being forced to make payments on behalf of peers unwilling or unable to pay back their loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Miguel |last=Palacios Lleras |year=2004 |title=Investing in Human Capital: A Capital Markets Approach to Student Funding |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=126 |isbn=0-521-82840-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Oregon legislators passed a bill that would investigate [[Pay It Forward (financial aid policy)|Pay It Forward]] as a college financing scheme. The model would allow students to attend college tuition-free, and then pay a proportion of their incomes post-graduation to finance the cost of their studies. However, unlike the Income Share Agreement model, Pay It Forward would be publicly funded, and it would offer fixed percentage repayments across all institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/pay-it-forward-oregon-college-tuition-99695.html|title=Can 'pay it forward' pay for college?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public debate over the Oregon plan led to renewed interest in equity-based funding models, including a prominent summit on Income Share Agreements at the [[New America Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newamerica.net/events/2013/_zero_education_debt|title=A Future With Zero Education Debt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a policy paper from the [[American Enterprise Institute]]. On April 9, 2014, Senator [[Marco Rubio]] announced the introduction of legislation that would 'broaden the use' of Income Share Agreements.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=Students Need Investors, Not Lenders|url=http://www.realclearpolicy.com/blog/2016/03/15/students_need_investors_not_lenders_1583.html|accessdate=21 March 2016|publisher=Real Clear Policy|date=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

Proponents of ISAs argue that they provide significant benefits over existing models of college financing:

'''Efficient allocation of resources'''

Since investors have an incentive to allow students to pay lower shares of their income when they enroll in high quality, low-cost educational programs, ISAs lead to a more efficient allocation of financial resources between colleges.&lt;ref name="aei" /&gt; 

This allows students to go to universities and educational institutions with higher placement and completion rates. A significant problem right now is that students frequently "underplace," i.e. prefer to go to a less expensive school, even if career outcomes from such schools are worse. ISAs allow a way to reward going to schools that provide more value and better career outcomes.

'''Insurance and downside protection''' 

ISAs reduce risk for students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=Students Need Investors, Not Lenders|url=http://www.realclearpolicy.com/blog/2016/03/15/students_need_investors_not_lenders_1583.html|accessdate=21 March 2016|publisher=Real Clear Policy|date=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore act as an [[insurance policy]] for graduates with low earnings:

{{quote|[With an ordinary student loan] my nominal monthly payment is fixed but my income could change or go away altogether (making certainty just a monthly repetition of bad news). With an Income Share Agreement the converse is true: I don’t know what my nominal monthly payment will be over the entire term, or how much I will pay overall, but I do know that I will always be able to afford it.&lt;ref name="newamerica"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edcentral.org/you-want-a-piece-of-me|title=You Want a Piece of Me?}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is a non-trivial benefit, since we know, based on current studies that student loans can impact both short term career outcomes and long term wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Batkeyev|first=Birzhan|last2=Krishnan|first2=Karthik|last3=Nandy|first3=Debarshi |date=March 2016 |title=Student Debt and Personal Portfolio Risk |ssrn=2777062 |work=Northeastern U. D’Amore-McKim School of Business Research Paper No. 2777062 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, recent articles indicate that student loans make it difficult for individuals to participate in the stock market to build long term wealth: &lt;blockquote&gt;“My money is spent servicing student loans,” said Marcus Wallace, a 25-year-old waiter in Washington, D.C. Until that debt is reduced, he explained, the great stock market bull run will have to go on without him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-dow-tops-25000-individual-investors-sit-it-out-1515099703|title=As Dow Tops 25000, Individual Investors Sit It Out|last=Otani|first=Akane|date=2018-01-04|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-01-05|last2=Dieterich|first2=Chris|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;'''Lower job search costs''' 

Research indicates that income based repayments make students' career outcomes more efficient by making the job search process less costly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herkenhoff|first=Kyle|last2=Phillips|first2=Gordon|last3=Cohen-Cole|first3=Ethan|date=May 2016|title=How Credit Constraints Impact Job Finding Rates, Sorting &amp; Aggregate Output |work=NBER Working Paper No. 22274 |doi=10.3386/w22274 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Does Student Debt Reduce Earnings? |date=November 2016 |first=Justin |last=Weidner |work=Working Paper |url=https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/jweidner/files/Weidner_JMP.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; If you are not worried about how to make your next repayment immediately, you are free to search for a job that is a better fit for your skills and can help you grow your career. 

'''Career development augmentation'''

Income share agreements align the incentives of investors to that of the student—i.e., both would like the student to do well in the job market. This creates an opening to combine ISA financing with career enhancement tools like career mentoring and networking support. Such a model can also help overcome many of the common concerns with ISAs (listed below). 

Students that need education finance the most (including low income, minority, and first generation students) also typically have limited social capital like family-based networks and career mentors that are frequently critical to success in the job market. ISAs augmented with career development provide a nice way to overcome such limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mystudentvoices.com/a-new-solution-to-the-student-loan-crisis-income-share-agreements-augmented-with-career-mentorship-6e334842c03a|title=A New Solution to the Student Loan Crisis: Income Share Agreements Augmented with Career Mentorship|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mentorworks.io/how-it-works/|title=How It Works - MentorWorks|work=MentorWorks|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Common concerns==

===Indentured servitude===
One of the most frequently cited concerns with Income Share Agreements is that they are a form of [[indentured servitude]]. Critics argue that because students owe a percentage of their income, the investor therefore own a piece of the student. For instance, Kevin Roose wrote in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine that ISA companies give "young people in the post-crash economy the chance to indenture themselves to patrons in the investor class."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/10/new-economy-is-indentured-taskrabbits.html|title=In the New Economy, Everyone Is an Indentured TaskRabbit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, advocates of ISAs contend that since students have no legal obligation to work in a particular industry, and since it is illegal for investors to pressure them into a certain career, students are no more “indentured” than those with a student loan. In fact, someone with a traditional student loan has less choice than someone with an ISA, because the student with a loan needs to be in a career where they make at least enough income to cover their monthly payment, whereas someone with an ISA can choose to never make any money, and would never owe the investor a dime.&lt;ref name="aei"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newamerica"/&gt;

===Uncaptured positive externalities===
Since Income Share Agreements are priced based on likely economic success, critics argue that programs that are not economically viable but still valuable to society may not receive ISAs. For instance, a Masters of Social Work is an expensive degree, but social workers often are not paid very much. Therefore, investors may not offer Income Share Agreements for social workers given current tuition rates. However, the same argument could be made for those with certain majors in the liberal arts. This risk is mitigated so long as other financing options are available, such as subsidized loans and grants from the federal government.&lt;ref name="aei"/&gt;

===Discrimination===
As of now,{{when|date=September 2016}} there are no documented cases of discrimination based on race or gender with ISA agreements, but some worry that should ISAs become a more popular model, the potential for discrimination could increase.&lt;ref name="aei"/&gt; While there are already anti-discrimination laws in most financial markets that would likely apply to ISA investors, the question, as of now, has not been completely resolved. Some advocates argue that ISAs are less discriminatory as compared to loans:

{{quote|Even when everyone receives the same interest rate, loans discriminate intensely on the dimension that really matters: affordability. Under a loan program with the same terms for all borrowers, a group who earns less than another despite having identical qualifications ends up with proportionally lower income after paying off that loan than the other group. To the extent that any systematic difference in income between two groups is unfair, loans in effect amplify the unfairness. If ISAs pool groups with similar qualifications but different income potential, then ISAs will partially address the unfairness that loans amplify.&lt;ref name="aei"/&gt;}}

===Creaming===
Some worry that ISAs would have the effect of "creaming" the best students and only fund elite institutions. However, ISAs should theoretically fund all economically viable programs (that is the future income of their graduates proportionately aligns with the cost of the degree), so the only way that could be true is if the vast majority of institutions are not economically viable.&lt;ref name="aei"/&gt;

'''Instructional Materials''' are any collection of materials including [[animate]] and inanimate objects and human and non-human resources that a teacher may use in teaching and learning situations to help achieve desired learning objectives.  Instructional materials may aid a student in concretizing a learning experience so as to make learning more exciting, interesting and interactive.
They are tools used in instructional activities, which include active learning and assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/relevance-of-the-use-of-instructional-materials-in-teaching-and-pedagogical-delivery/48956|work=global dictionary|accessdate=4 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term encompasses all the materials and physical means an instructor might use to implement instruction and facilitate students achievement of instructional objectives.

The value of instructional materials as a pedagogical aid can be seen in [[Vachel Lindsay]]'s poem "Euclid":
{{Quote
|text=&lt;poem&gt;Old [[Euclid]] drew a circle
On a sand-beach, long ago.
He bounded and enclosed it
With angles thus and so.

His set of solemn greybeards
Nodded and argued much
Of [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] and of circumference
Diameter and such.

A silent child stood by them
From morning until noon,
Because they drew such charming
Round pictures of the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Poetry: A Magazine of Verse |volume=II |date=April–September 1913 |editor1-last=Monroe |editor1-first=Harriet |last=Lindsay |first=Vachel |chapter=Euclid |page=123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4IcVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Types of Instructional Materials==

==Evaluation of Instructional Materials==
===Peer-Reviewed Instructional Materials Online (PRIMO) Committee===
The Peer-Reviewed Instructional Materials Online (PRIMO) Committee "'promotes and shares peer-reviewed instructional materials created by librarians to teach people about discovering, accessing and evaluating information in networked environments.' In doing so, it reviews librarian-created online tutorials dealing with information literacy and critical thinking skills, and highlights the highest-caliber projects through its “Site of the Month” posts on the ACRL Instruction Section blog (http://acrl.ala.org/IS/category/committees/primo)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaspar |first1=Wendy |last2=Borgerding |first2=Jodie |date=2017 |title=PRIMO: Peer-Reviewed Instructional Materials Online |url=https://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/16563/18009 |journal=College and Research Libraries (Online) |volume=78 |pages=2–7 |doi=10.5860/crl.78.1.2 |access-date=July 1, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  PRIMO's goal is to provide librarians quality tutorials for instructional use on a variety of topics in order to save time, effort and cost.  PRIMO accepts non-promotional online instructional material intended for undergraduate or graduate-level audiences emphasizing quality over comprehensiveness.

===Instructional Materials Evaluation Tool===

'''Isfahan University of Medical Sciences''' ('''IUMS''') ({{lang-fa|دانشگاه علوم پزشکی و خدمات بهداشتی درمانی اصفهان}}) is a university specializing in [[basic medical sciences]], [[clinical science]], and [[health services]], located in [[Isfahan, Iran]].

Isfahan University of Medical Sciences is one of the world's oldest universities. It is also one of the most prestigious Iranian medical schools. Admission to the university is limited to students with top scores on the national entrance examination, administered yearly by the [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran)]].

[[Isfahan]] University of Medical Sciences was founded by Great [[Avicenna]](Ibn_sina), under the patronage of the Kakouid ruler Alla-al-Dowleh in 1024/1025. It soon became one of the leading educational centers of the historic Muslim world. Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (IUMS), was established in 1946, as the Isfahan Higher School of Health Education. In 1950, the Isfahan Faculty of Medicine was inaugurated and students were admitted for the M.D. degrees after a 6-year medical training course.. Today, the university campus is located on Hezarjarib Street in southern [[Isfahan]].

Isfahan University of Medical Sciences provides undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate programs in 10 faculties and 75 main departments. The student body consists of about 10,000 students from all 31 [[provinces of Iran]] and some foreign countries. Funding for Isfahan University of Medical Sciences is provided by the government (via the ministry of health and medical education) and through some private investments.

== History ==

To the north of the [[Isfahan]] city centre lies an area called Dardasht, formerly known as Bab-ol Dasht, through which the Khiaban-e-Ibn Sina ([[Avicenna]] st.) runs. This ancient 11th century dome traditionally marks the spot where the great Sheikh-al-Rais Ibn-e-Sina, or [[Avicenna]], as he is known in the West, established his school of medicine under the patronage of the Kakouid ruler Alla-al-Dowleh Mohammad, who had conquered the town from the Deylamid rulers at the start of the 11th Century.

Teaching at the school began as early as 1024 under the name of "Alaii School" (مدرس علایی )/Avicenna School(مدرس ابن سینا), making Isfahan University of Medical Sciences the oldest medical university in the world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.

[[File:IbnSinaCanon1.jpg|thumb|12th-century manuscript of the ''Canon'' kept at the [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]].]]

Avicenna settled in Isfahan and authored a five-volume medical encyclopedia: the [[Canon of Medicine]] (Al-Qanun fi't-Tibb). It was used as the standard medical textbook in Isfahan, the Islamic world, India, and Europe until the 18th Century.

[[File:IbnSinaCanon4.jpg|328x328px]]

According to Abu Ubayd al-Juzjāni, a pupil and a close companion of Avicenna, the students used to gather at the residence of Sheikh al-Raiss (Avicenna′s school) every night and would study his book of [[Canon of Medicine|Canon]] and Shifā one by one under his instruction. The Canon still plays an important role in Iranian (Unani) medicine.

Avicenna (Ibn Sina) has been described as the "father of early modern medicine." He is credited with various medical observations and discoveries, such as recognizing the potential of airborne transmission of disease, providing insight into many psychiatric conditions, recommending the use of forceps in deliveries complicated by fetal distress, distinguishing central from peripheral facial paralysis, and describing guinea worm infection and trigeminal neuralgia. His works cover subjects including angelology, heart medicine, and treatment of kidney diseases.

Avicenna (Ibn Sina) was also a pioneer of experimental medicine, [[evidence-based medicine]], pharmaceutical sciences, clinical pharmacology, aromatherapy, pulsology, and sphygmology. 

The school of medicine in Isfahan by Avicenna became the representative of Islamic (Irani) medicine mainly through the influence of Ibn Sina's famous work al-Canon fi Tibb. The book was originally used as a textbook for instructors and students of medical sciences in the medical school of Avicenna.

[[File:Nabz pezeshk.jpg|thumb|Safavid lacquer work illustrating a physician taking the pulse of a patient. From a 17th-century copy of Avicenna's Canon of Medicine. Wellcome Library, London.]]

Abu ubaid al juzjani was a famous pupil of Avicenna. He spent many years with his master in Isfahan, becoming his lifetime companion. After Avicenna's death, he completed Avicenna's autobiography with a concluding section. He and the other students of Avicenna continued teaching in Avicenna's school in Isfahan.

[[File:Avicenna canon 1597.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of a manuscript of Avicenna's ''Canon'', dated 1596/7 (Yale, Medical Historical Library, Cushing Arabic ms. 5)]]

Also, [[Ibn Miskawayh]] (Persian: مُسکویه, 932–1030) was a Persian chancery official of the era, and a philosopher and physician that taught in the Isfahan school of medicine. As a Neoplatonist, his influence on Islamic philosophy is primarily in the area of ethics. Ibn Miskawayh was one of the first to clearly describe a version of the idea of [[evolution]].

The idea to establish the modern university came from doctors at the Amin Hospital in 1939. Finally, the hospital's board of directors approved a plan to establish the [[Isfahan]] Higher Institute of Health in 1946. Isfahan University of Medical Sciences was established as a modern institution in 1946 under the name "The Higher Institute of Health" and later was elevated to the "School of Medicine". 

In September of the same year, an ad signed by lecturer Dr. Jelveh, then caretaker of [[Isfahan Province]] Health and Medical Treatment Department, was published in local newspapers calling on prospective students to enroll in the new institute.

The first classes were held at the old Sa'di High School (now the Soureh Institute). Many more students enrolled in subsequent years. Therefore, the institute had to find a larger campus to accommodate the growing number of new students. As a result, the [[Isfahan University]] was founded to accommodate these students and establish new faculties.

On October 29, 1950, the first series of classes were held at the new campus, named the [[University of Isfahan]]. The newly established school of Medicine at Sa'di School and Literature College on Shahzadeh Ebrahim Street joined the University of Isfahan and relocated themselves to the main campus.

The university later offered programs in human sciences, engineering and medical sciences. Related programs of medical sciences, although they were the parent programs of [[Isfahan University]], were then separated from the [[University of Isfahan]] and became an independent university named Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(IUMS) in 1985.

With 12 hospitals and 75 departments, the university is currently a regional health care provider and the main medical center in [[Isfahan Province]] and [[central Iran]].

His work retains major academic influence throughout [[continental Europe]], [[South America]] and all other countries where "[[continental philosophy]]" has been predominant, particularly in debates around [[ontology]], [[epistemology]] (especially concerning [[social sciences]]), [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], [[hermeneutics]], and the [[philosophy of language]].

Particularly in his later writings, Derrida addressed ethical and political themes in his work. Some critics consider ''[[Speech and Phenomena]]'' (1967) to be his most important work. Others cite ''[[Of Grammatology]], [[Writing and Difference]]'', and ''Margins of Philosophy''. These writings influenced various activists and political movements.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; He became a well-known and influential public figure, while his approach to philosophy and the notorious abstruseness of his work made him controversial.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;Lawlor, Leonard.

==Life==
Derrida was born on July 15, 1930, in a summer home in [[El Biar]] ([[Algiers]]), Algeria,&lt;ref name="Jackie"/&gt; into a [[Sephardic]] Jewish family (originally from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]) that became French in 1870 when the [[Crémieux Decree]] granted full French citizenship to the indigenous Arabic-speaking Jews of Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;"I took part in the extraordinary transformation of the Algerian Jews; my great-grandparents were by language, custom, etc., still identified with Arabic culture. After the Cremieux Decree (1870), at the end of the 19th c., the following generation became bourgeois", ''[http://www.studiovisit.net/SV.Derrida.pdf Jacques Derrida The Last Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305215949/http://www.studiovisit.net/SV.Derrida.pdf |date=March 5, 2009 }}'', May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, Haïm Aaron Prosper Charles (Aimé) Derrida (1896–1970)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gw4.geneanet.org/index.php3?b=michelzaffran&amp;lang=fr;p=haim+aaron+prosper+charles+aime;n=derrida |title=Haim, Aaron, Prosper, Charles, Aimé Aimé, Mémé - Arbre Familial des Zaffran (Zafran et Safran), Miguéres, Gharbi, Allouche, Safar, Temime etc... - GeneaNet |publisher=Gw4.geneanet.org |date=18 January 2012 |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Georgette Sultana Esther Safar (1901–1991),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; Georgette, Sultana, Esther SAFAR |url=http://gw4.geneanet.org/index.php3?b=michelzaffran&amp;lang=fr;p=georgette+sultana+esther;n=safar |title=Georgette, Sultana, Esther SAFAR - Arbre Familial des Zaffran (Zafran et Safran), Miguéres, Gharbi, Allouche, Safar, Temime etc... - GeneaNet |publisher=Gw4.geneanet.org |date=18 January 2012 |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennington91p325"&gt;Bennington (1991), p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Safar surname: occupational name from Arabic ''saffar'' which means ''worker in copper or brass''", [http://www.ancestry.com/facts/Safar-family-history-uk.ashx The Safar surname]"&lt;/ref&gt; named him "Jackie", "which they considered to be an American name", though he would later adopt a more "correct" version of his first name when he moved to Paris; some reports indicate that he was named Jackie after the American child actor [[Jackie Coogan]], who had become well-known around the world via his role in the 1921 [[Charlie Chaplin]] film [[The Kid (1921 film)|''The Kid'']].&lt;ref name="Powell 2006, p. 12"&gt;Powell (2006), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,11617,1324460,00.html Obituary in ''The Guardian''], accessed August 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cixous (2001), p. vii; also see this  [http://www.themodernword.com/features/interview_caputo.html interview with Derrida's long-term collaborator John Caputo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524102847/http://www.themodernword.com/features/interview_caputo.html |date=2005-05-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also given the middle name [[Élie]] after his paternal uncle Eugène Eliahou, at his [[circumcision]]; this name was not recorded on his birth certificate unlike those of his siblings, and he would later call it his "hidden name".&lt;ref name="Circumfession"&gt;{{cite book|last= Peeters|first= Benoît|title= Derrida: A Biography|year= 2012|publisher= Polity|page= 13|quote= "When he was circumcised, he was given a second forename, Elie, which was not entered on his birth certificate, unlike the equivalent names of his brother and sister."}} See also {{cite book|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|title=Jacques Derrida|chapter="Circumfession"|year=1993|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|page=96|quote="'So I have borne, without bearing, without its ever being written (12-23-76)' the name of the prophet Élie, Elijah in English ... so I took myself toward the hidden name without its ever being written on the official records, the same name as that of the paternal uncle Eugène Eliahou Derrida ..."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrida was the third of five children. His elder brother Paul Moïse died at less than three months old, the year before Derrida was born, leading him to suspect throughout his life his role as a replacement for his deceased brother.''&lt;ref name="Powell 2006, p. 12"/&gt;'' Derrida spent his youth in Algiers and in El-Biar.

On the first day of the school year in 1942, French administrators in Algeria—implementing [[antisemitism]] quotas set by the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government—expelled Derrida from his [[lycée]]. He secretly skipped school for a year rather than attend the Jewish lycée formed by displaced teachers and students, and also took part in numerous [[association football|football]] competitions (he dreamed of becoming a professional player). In this adolescent period, Derrida found in the works of philosophers and writers (such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[André Gide|Gide]]) an instrument of revolt against family and society.&lt;ref name="TeenBooks"/&gt; His reading also included [[Albert Camus|Camus]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]].&lt;ref name = "TeenBooks" /&gt;

In the late 1940s, he attended the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Bugeaud|fr}}, in Algiers;&lt;ref name="Schrift p. 120"/&gt; in 1949 he moved to Paris,&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; attending the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]],&lt;ref name="Schrift p. 120"/&gt; where his professor of philosophy was [[Étienne Borne]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc Goldschmidt, ''Jacques Derrida : une introduction'', 2003, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time he prepared for his entrance exam to the prestigious [[École Normale Supérieure]] (ENS); after failing the exam on his first try, he passed it on the second, and was admitted in 1952.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; On his first day at ENS, Derrida met [[Louis Althusser]], with whom he became friends. After visiting the [[Husserl-Archives Leuven|Husserl Archive]] in [[Leuven]], Belgium (1953–1954), he completed his [[master's degree]] in philosophy (''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'') on [[Edmund Husserl]] (see [[#Early works|below]]). He then passed the highly competitive ''[[agrégation]]'' exam in 1956. Derrida received a grant for studies at [[Harvard University]], and he spent the 1956–57 academic year reading [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' at the [[Widener Library]].&lt;ref name = "Caputo97P25"&gt;Caputo (1997), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1957, he married the psychoanalyst [[Marguerite Aucouturier]] in [[Boston]]. During the [[Algerian War of Independence]] of 1954–1962, Derrida asked to teach soldiers' children in lieu of military service, teaching French and English from 1957 to 1959.

Following the war, from 1960 to 1964, Derrida taught philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he was an assistant of [[Suzanne Bachelard]] (daughter of [[Gaston Bachelard|Gaston]]), [[Georges Canguilhem]], [[Paul Ricœur]] (who in these years coined the term ''school of suspicion'') and [[Jean Wahl]].&lt;ref&gt;Bennington (1991), p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Marguerite, gave birth to their first child, [[Pierre Alféri|Pierre]], in 1963. In 1964, on the recommendation of [[Louis Althusser]] and [[Jean Hyppolite]], Derrida got a permanent teaching position at the ENS, which he kept until 1984.&lt;ref name="Powell06p34-5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell06p58"/&gt; In 1965 Derrida began an association with the ''[[Tel Quel]]'' group of literary and philosophical theorists, which lasted for seven years.&lt;ref name="Powell06p58"&gt;Powell (2006), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida's subsequent distance from the ''Tel Quel'' group, after 1971, has been attributed{{by whom|date=April 2015}} to his reservations about their embrace of [[Maoism]] and of the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Hill, ''The Cambridge Introduction to Jacques Derrida'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

With "[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences]]", his contribution to a 1966 colloquium on [[structuralism]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]], his work began to gain international prominence. At the same colloquium Derrida would meet [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Paul de Man]], the latter an important interlocutor in the years to come.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida and Geoffrey Bennington, ''Jacques Derrida'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; A second son, Jean, was born in 1967. In the same year, Derrida published his first three books—''[[Writing and Difference]]'', ''[[Speech and Phenomena]]'', and ''[[Of Grammatology]]''.

In 1980, he received his first [[honorary doctorate]] (from [[Columbia University]]) and was awarded his [[State doctorate]] (''doctorat d'État'') by submitting to the [[University of Paris]] ten of his previously published books in conjunction with a defense of his intellectual project under the title "L'inscription de la philosophie : Recherches sur l'interprétation de l'écriture" ("Inscription in Philosophy: Research on the Interpretation of Writing").&lt;ref name="Schrift p. 120"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell p. 145"&gt;Powell (2006), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; The text of Derrida's defense was based on an abandoned draft thesis he had prepared in 1957 under the direction of [[Jean Hyppolite]] at the ENS titled "The Ideality of the Literary Object"&lt;ref name="Powell p. 145"/&gt; ("L'idéalité de l’objet littéraire");&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leseditionsdeminuit.com/f/index.php?sp=livAut&amp;auteur_id=1522 Jacques Derrida - Editions de Minuit]&lt;/ref&gt; his 1980 dissertation was subsequently published in English translation as "The Time of a Thesis: Punctuations". In 1983 Derrida collaborated with [[Ken McMullen (film director)|Ken McMullen]] on the film ''[[Ghost Dance (film)|Ghost Dance]]''. Derrida appears in the film as himself and also contributed to the script.

Derrida traveled widely and held a series of visiting and permanent positions. Derrida became full professor (''directeur d'études'') at the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] in Paris from 1984 (he had been elected at the end of 1983).&lt;ref name="Powell p. 145"/&gt;  With [[François Châtelet]] and others he in 1983 co-founded the [[Collège international de philosophie]] (CIPH), an institution intended to provide a location for philosophical research which could not be carried out elsewhere in the academia. He was elected as its first president. In 1985 [[Sylviane Agacinski]] gave birth to Derrida's third child, Daniel.&lt;ref name="Guardian20041011"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/11/guardianobituaries.france "Obituary: Jacques Derrida"], by Derek Attridge and Thomas Baldwin, ''[[The Guardian]]'', October 11, 2004. Retrieved January 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 Derrida became Professor of the Humanities at the [[University of California, Irvine]], where he taught until shortly before his death in 2004. His papers were filed in the university archives. After Derrida's death, his widow and sons said they wanted copies of UCI's archives shared with the Institute of Contemporary Publishing Archives in France. The university had sued in an attempt to get manuscripts and correspondence from Derrida's widow and children that it believed the philosopher had promised to UC Irvine's collection, although it dropped the suit in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.continental-philosophy.org/2007/02/15/uc-irvine-drops-suit-over-derridas-personal-papers/ UC Irvine drops suit over Derrida's personal papers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520021511/http://www.continental-philosophy.org/2007/02/15/uc-irvine-drops-suit-over-derridas-personal-papers/ |date=May 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrida was a regular visiting professor at several other major American and European universities, including [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Yale University]], [[New York University]], [[Stony Brook University]], and [[The New School for Social Research]].

He was awarded honorary doctorates by the [[University of Cambridge]] (1992), [[Columbia University]], [[The New School for Social Research]], the [[University of Essex]], [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], the [[University of Silesia]], the [[University of Coimbra]], the [[University of Athens]], and many others around the world.

Derrida's honorary degree at Cambridge was protested by leading philosophers in the analytic tradition.  Philosophers including [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], [[Ruth Barcan Marcus|Marcus]], and [[David Malet Armstrong|Armstrong]] wrote a letter to the university objecting that "Derrida's work does not meet accepted standards of clarity and rigour," and "Academic status based on what seems to us to be little more than semi-intelligible attacks upon the values of reason, truth, and scholarship is not, we submit, sufficient grounds for the awarding of an honorary degree in a distinguished university".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digressionsnimpressions.typepad.com/digressionsimpressions/2016/03/the-letter-against-derridas-honorary-degree.html |title=The Letter against Derrida's Honorary Degree, re-examined |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrida was a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. Although his membership in Class IV, Section 1 (Philosophy and Religious Studies) was rejected,{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} he was subsequently elected to Class IV, Section 3 (Literary Criticism, including Philology).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} He received the 2001 [[:De:Theodor-W.-Adorno-Preis|Adorno-Preis]] from the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]].

Late in his life, Derrida participated in making two biographical documentaries, ''D'ailleurs, Derrida'' (''Derrida's Elsewhere'') by [[Safaa Fathy]] (1999),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356496/ IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Derrida (film)|Derrida]]'' by [[Kirby Dick]] and Amy Ziering Kofman (2002).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303326/ IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrida was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]] in 2003, which reduced his speaking and travelling engagements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_derrida.html philosophybasics.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He died during surgery in a hospital in Paris in the early hours of October 9, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21050-2004Oct9.html, Jacques Derrida Dies; Deconstructionist Philosopher], accessed May 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/obituaries/jacques-derrida-abstruse-theorist-dies-at-74.html |title=Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies at 74 |last=Kandell |first=Jonathan |work=The New York Times|date=October 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the time of his death, Derrida had agreed to go for the summer to [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] as holder of the [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] professorship,&lt;ref name="uni-heidelberg.de"&gt;
"[http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/press/news/press358_e.html The University of Heidelberg Mourns the Death of Jacques Derrida]"&lt;/ref&gt; whose invitation was expressed by the hermeneutic philosopher himself before his death. Peter Hommelhoff, Rector at Heidelberg by that time, would summarize Derrida's place as: "Beyond the boundaries of philosophy as an academic discipline he was a leading intellectual figure not only for the humanities but for the cultural perception of a whole age."&lt;ref name="uni-heidelberg.de"/&gt;

{{Main|Deconstruction}}
Derrida referred to himself as a historian.&lt;ref name="Afterword88P130" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LitHistorian"&gt;Derrida (1989) ''This Strange Institution Called Literature'', p. 54: {{quote|Contrary to what some people believe or have an interest in making believe, I consider myself very much a historian, very historicist [...] Deconstruction calls for a highly "historian's" attitude (''Of Grammatology'', for example, is a history book through and through).}}&lt;/ref&gt; He questioned assumptions of the [[Western philosophical tradition]] and also more broadly [[Western culture]].&lt;ref name="NationObituaries"/&gt; By questioning the dominant discourses, and trying to modify them, he attempted to [[democratize]] the university scene and to politicize it.&lt;ref name="CambridgeInterviewOct92"&gt;Derrida (1992) ''Cambridge Review'', pp. 404, 408–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida called his challenge to the assumptions of [[Western culture]] "[[deconstruction]]".&lt;ref name="NationObituaries"/&gt; On some occasions, Derrida referred to deconstruction as a radicalization of a certain spirit of [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;Derrida (1976) ''Where a Teaching Body Begins'', English translation 2002, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Derrida|first = Jacques |year = 1993|title = Spectres of Marx|page = 92|language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his detailed readings of works from Plato to Rousseau to Heidegger, Derrida frequently argues that Western philosophy has uncritically allowed metaphorical depth models to govern its conception of language and consciousness.  He sees these often unacknowledged assumptions as part of a "metaphysics of presence" to which philosophy has bound itself.  This "logocentrism," Derrida argues, creates "marked" or hierarchized binary oppositions that have an effect on everything from our conception of speech's relation to writing to our understanding of racial difference.  Deconstruction is an attempt to expose and undermine such "metaphysics."

Derrida approaches texts as constructed around binary oppositions which all speech has to articulate if it intends to make any sense whatsoever. This approach to text is, in a broad sense, influenced by the [[semiology]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]].&lt;ref name="Royle04p62"&gt;[[Nicholas Royle|Royle, Nicholas]] (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=nNaSdb9VMTwC ''Jacques Derrida''], pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferraris97p76"&gt;Derrida and Ferraris (1997), p. 76:
{{quote|I take great interest in questions of language and rhetoric, and I think they deserve enormous consideration, but there is a point where the authority of final jurisdiction is neither rhetorical nor linguistic, nor even discursive. The notion of trace or of text is introduced to mark the limits of the linguistic turn. This is one more reason why I prefer to speak of 'mark' rather than of language. In the first place, the mark is not anthropological; it is prelinguistic; it is the possibility of language, and it is everywhere there is a relation to another thing or relation to another. For such relations, the mark has no need of language.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Saussure, considered to be one of the fathers of [[structuralism]], posited that terms get their meaning in reciprocal determination with other terms inside language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saussure|first=Ferdinand de|title=Course in General Linguistics|year=1916 [trans. 1959]|publisher=New York Philosophical Library|location=New York|pages=121–22|url=http://faculty.smu.edu/dfoster/cf3324/saussure.htm}}
{{quote|In language there are only differences. Even more important: a difference generally implies positive terms between which the difference is set up; but in language, there are only differences without positive terms. Whether we take the signified or the signifier, language has neither ideas nor sounds that existed before the linguistic system, but only conceptual and phonic differences that have issued from the system. The idea or phonic substance that a sign contains is of less importance than the other signs that surround it. [...] A linguistic system is a series of differences of sound combined with a series of differences of ideas; but the pairing of a certain number of acoustical signs with as many cuts made from the mass thought engenders a system of values.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps Derrida's most quoted and famous assertion,&lt;ref name="Royle04p62"/&gt; which appears in an essay on [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] in his book ''[[Of Grammatology]]'' (1967),&lt;ref name="Derrida67p158"&gt;Derrida (1967) ''Of Grammatology'', Part II ''Introduction to the "Age of Rousseau,"'' section 2 "...''That Dangerous Supplement''...", title ''The Exorbitant.

In this form, which says exactly the same thing, the formula would doubtless have been less shocking."&lt;ref name="Afterword88P136"&gt;Derrida (1988) ''Afterword'', p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glendinning|first=Simon|title=Jacques Derrida: A Very Short Introduction|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early works&lt;!--linked from the 'Life' section--&gt;===
Derrida began his career examining the limits of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. His first lengthy academic manuscript, written as a dissertation for his ''diplôme d'études supérieures'' and submitted in 1954, concerned the work of [[Edmund Husserl]].&lt;ref&gt;The dissertation was eventually published in 1990 with the title ''Le problème de la genèse dans la philosophie de Husserl''. English translation: ''The Problem of Genesis in Husserl's Philosophy'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 he published ''Edmund Husserl's Origin of Geometry: An Introduction'', which contained his own translation of Husserl's essay. Many elements of Derrida's thought were already present in this work. In the interviews collected in ''[[Positions]]'' (1972), Derrida said: "In this essay the problematic of writing was already in place as such, bound to the irreducible structure of 'deferral' in its relationships to consciousness, presence, science, history and the history of science, the disappearance or delay of the origin, etc. [...] this essay can be read as the other side (recto or verso, as you wish) of ''Speech and Phenomena''."&lt;ref name="67RonseP5"&gt;J. Derrida (1967), interview with Henri Ronse, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrida first received major attention outside France with his lecture, "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences," delivered at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1966 (and subsequently included in ''Writing and Difference''). The conference at which this paper was delivered was concerned with [[structuralism]], then at the peak of its influence in France, but only beginning to gain attention in the United States. Derrida differed from other participants by his lack of explicit commitment to structuralism, having already been critical of the movement. He praised the accomplishments of structuralism but also maintained reservations about its internal limitations;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences," in ''[[Writing and Difference]]'', trans. Alan Bass (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978), p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; this has led US academics to label his thought as a form of [[post-structuralism]].&lt;ref name="Bensmaia05"&gt;Bensmaïa, Réda, "Poststructuralism", in Kritzman (2005), pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poster88"&gt;Poster (1988), pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The effect of Derrida's paper was such that by the time the conference proceedings were published in 1970, the title of the collection had become ''The Structuralist Controversy''. The conference was also where he met [[Paul de Man]], who would be a close friend and source of great controversy, as well as where he first met the French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]], with whose work Derrida enjoyed a mixed relationship.

===Phenomenology vs structuralism debate (1959)===
In the early 1960s, Derrida began speaking and writing publicly, addressing the most topical debates at the time. One of these was the new and increasingly fashionable movement of [[structuralism]], which was being widely favoured as the successor to the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] approach, the latter having been started by Husserl sixty years earlier. Derrida's countercurrent takes on the issue, at a prominent international conference, was so influential that it reframed the discussion from a celebration of the triumph of structuralism to a "phenomenology vs structuralism debate."

Phenomenology, as envisioned by Husserl, is a method of philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated Western thought since [[Plato]] in favor of a method of reflective attentiveness that discloses the individual's "lived experience;" for those with a more phenomenological bent, the goal was to understand experience by comprehending and describing its genesis, the process of its emergence from an origin or event.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} For the structuralists, this was a false problem, and the "depth" of experience could in fact only be an effect of structures which are not themselves experiential.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In that context, in 1959, Derrida asked the question: Must not structure have a genesis, and must not the origin, the point of genesis, be ''already'' structured, in order to be the genesis ''of'' something?&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, "'Genesis' and 'Structure' and Phenomenology," in ''Writing and Difference'' (London: Routledge, 1978), paper originally delivered in 1959 at Cerisy-la-Salle, and originally published in Gandillac, Goldmann &amp; Piaget (eds.), ''Genèse et structure'' (The Hague: Morton, 1964), p. 167:

{{quote|All these formulations have been possible thanks to the initial distinction between different irreducible types of genesis and structure: worldly genesis and transcendental genesis, empirical structure, eidetic structure, and transcendental structure. To ask oneself the following historico-semantic question: "What does the notion of genesis ''in general'', on whose basis the Husserlian diffraction could come forth and be understood, mean, and what has it always meant? What does the notion of structure ''in general'', on whose basis Husserl ''operates'' and operates distinctions between empirical, eidetic, and transcendental dimensions mean, and what has it always meant throughout its displacements? And what is the historico-semantic relationship between Genesis and structure ''in general''?" is not only simply to ask a prior linguistic question. It is to ask the question about the unity of the historical ground on whose basis a transcendental reduction is possible and is motivated by itself. It is to ask the question about the unity of the world from which transcendental freedom releases itself, in order to make the origin of this unity appear.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, every structural or "synchronic" phenomenon has a history, and the structure cannot be understood without understanding its genesis.&lt;ref&gt;If in 1959 Derrida was addressing this question of genesis and structure to Husserl, that is, to phenomenology, then in "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences" (also in ''Writing and Difference''; see [[#1967–1972|below]]), he addresses these same questions to Lévi-Strauss and the structuralists. This is clear from the very first line of the paper (p. 278):

{{quote|Perhaps something has occurred in the history of the concept of structure that could be called an "event," if this loaded word did not entail a meaning which it is precisely the function of structural—or structuralist—thought to reduce or to suspect.}}

Between these two papers is staked Derrida's philosophical ground, if not indeed his step beyond or outside philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, in order that there be movement or potential, the origin cannot be some pure unity or simplicity, but must already be articulated—complex—such that from it a "diachronic" process can emerge. This original complexity must not be understood as an original ''positing'', but more like a default of origin, which Derrida refers to as iterability, inscription, or textuality.&lt;ref name="DerridaScarpetta71"&gt;Derrida (1971), Scarpetta interview, quote from pp. 77–8:

{{quote|If the alterity of the other is ''posed'', that is, ''only'' posed, does it not amount to ''the same'', for example in the form of the "constituted object" or of the "informed product" invested with meaning, etc.? From this point of view, I would even say that the alterity of the other ''inscribes'' in this relationship that which in no case can be "posed." Inscription, as I would define it in this respect, is not a simple position: it is rather that by means of which every position is ''of itself confounded'' (''[[différance]]''): inscription, mark, text and not only ''thesis or theme''-inscription of the ''thesis''.}}

On the phrase "default of origin" as applied to Derrida's work, cf. [[Bernard Stiegler]], "Derrida and Technology: Fidelity at the Limits of Deconstruction and the Prosthesis of Faith," in Tom Cohen (ed.) ''Jacques Derrida and the Humanities'' (Cambridge &amp; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001). Stiegler understands Derrida's thinking of textuality and inscription in terms of a thinking of originary technicity, and in this context speaks of "the originary default of origin that arche-writing constitutes" (p. 239). See also Stiegler, ''[[Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus]]'' (Stanford: [[Stanford University Press]], 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; It is this thought of originary complexity that sets Derrida's work in motion, and from which all of its terms are derived, including "deconstruction".&lt;ref&gt;It is opposed to the concept of original purity, which destabilises the thought of both "genesis" and "structure", cf. [[Rodolphe Gasché]], ''The Tain of the Mirror'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts, &amp; London: Harvard University Press, 1986), p. 146:

{{quote|It is an opening that is structural or the structurality of an opening. Yet each of these concepts excludes the other. It is thus as little a structure as it is an opening; it is as little static as it is genetic, as little structural as it is historical. It can be understood neither from a genetic nor from a structuralist and taxonomic point of view, nor from a combination of both points of view.}}

And note that this complexity of the origin is thus not only spatial but temporal, which is why ''différance'' is a matter not only of difference but of delay or deferral. One way in which this question is raised in relation to Husserl is thus the question of the possibility of a phenomenology of ''history'', which Derrida raises in ''Edmund Husserl's Origin of Geometry: An Introduction'' (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrida's method consisted in demonstrating the forms and varieties of this originary complexity, and their multiple consequences in many fields. He achieved this by conducting thorough, careful, sensitive, and yet transformational readings of philosophical and literary texts, to determine what aspects of those texts run counter to their apparent systematicity (structural unity) or intended sense (authorial genesis). By demonstrating the [[aporia]]s and ellipses of thought, Derrida hoped to show the infinitely subtle ways in which this originary complexity, which by definition cannot ever be completely known, works its structuring and destructuring effects.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Rodolphe Gasché, "Infrastructures and Systematicity," in [[John Sallis]] (ed.), ''Deconstruction and Philosophy'' (Chicago &amp; London: University of Chicago Press, 1987), pp. 3–4:

{{quote|One of the more persistent misunderstandings that have thus far forestalled a productive debate with Derrida's philosophical thought is the assumption, shared by many philosophers as well as literary critics, that within that thought just anything is possible. Derrida's philosophy is more often than not construed as a license for arbitrary free play in flagrant disregard of all established rules of argumentation, traditional requirements of thought, and ethical standards binding upon the interpretative community. Undoubtedly, some of the works of Derrida may not have been entirely innocent in this respect and may have contributed, however obliquely, to fostering to some extent that very misconception. But deconstruction which for many has come to designate the content and style of Derrida's thinking, reveals to even a superficial examination, a well-ordered procedure, a step-by-step type of argumentation based on an acute awareness of level-distinctions, a marked thoroughness and regularity. [...] Deconstruction must be understood, we contend, as the attempt to "account," in a certain manner, for a heterogeneous variety or manifold of nonlogical contradictions and discursive equalities of all sorts that continues to haunt and fissure even the ''successful'' development of philosophical arguments and their systematic exposition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1967–1972&lt;!--linked from the 'Phenomenology vs structuralism debate (1959)' section--&gt;===
Derrida's interests crossed disciplinary boundaries, and his knowledge of a wide array of diverse material was reflected in the three collections of work published in 1967: ''Speech and Phenomena'', ''[[Of Grammatology]]'' (initially submitted as a ''[[Doctorat de spécialité]]'' thesis under [[Maurice de Gandillac]]),&lt;ref name="Schrift p. 120"&gt;Alan D. Schrift (2006), ''Twentieth-Century French Philosophy: Key Themes And Thinkers'', Blackwell Publishing, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Writing and Difference''.&lt;ref name="67RonseP4"&gt;Derrida (1967) interview with Henri Ronse, pp. 4–5: "[''Speech and Phenomena''] is perhaps the essay which I like most. Doubtless, I could have bound it as a long note to one or the other of the other two works. ''Of Grammatology'' refers to it and economizes its development. But in a classical philosophical architecture, ''Speech...'' would come first: in it is posed, at a point which appears juridically decisive for reasons that I cannot explain here, the question of the privilege of the voice and of phonetic writing in their relationship to the entire history of the West, such as this history can be represented by the history of metaphysics and metaphysics in its most modern, critical and vigilant form: Husserl's transcendental phenomenology."&lt;/ref&gt;

On several occasions, Derrida has acknowledged his debt to [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], and stated that without them he would not have said a single word.&lt;ref name="67RonseP8"&gt;Derrida (1967) interview with Henri Ronse, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LetterJap"&gt;On the influence of Heidegger, Derrida claims in his "Letter to a Japanese Friend" (''Derrida and différance'', eds. [[Robert Bernasconi]] and [[David Wood (philosopher)|David Wood]]) that the word "déconstruction" was his attempt both to translate and re-appropriate for his own ends the Heideggerian terms ''Destruktion'' and ''Abbau'', via a word from the French language, the varied senses of which seemed consistent with his requirements. This relationship with the Heideggerian term was chosen over the Nietzschean term "demolition," as Derrida shared Heidegger's interest in renovating philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the questions asked in these essays are "What is 'meaning', what are its historical relationships to what is purportedly identified under the rubric 'voice' as a value of presence, presence of the object, presence of meaning to consciousness, self-presence in so called living speech and in self-consciousness?"&lt;ref name="67RonseP4"/&gt; In another essay in ''Writing and Difference'' entitled "Violence and Metaphysics: An Essay on the Thought of Emmanuel Levinas", the roots of another major theme in Derrida's thought emerges: the Other as opposed to the Same&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, J. Violence and Metaphysics: An Essay on the Thought of Emmanuel Levinas, ''Writing and Difference''. Chicago: University of Chicago. 97–192.&lt;/ref&gt; "Deconstructive analysis deprives the present of its prestige and exposes it to something ''tout autre'', "wholly other," beyond what is foreseeable from the present, beyond the horizon of the "same"."&lt;ref name="Caputo97P42"&gt;Caputo (1997), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Other than Rousseau, Husserl, Heidegger and [[Emmanuel Levinas|Levinas]], these three books discussed, and/or relied upon, the works of many philosophers and authors, including linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]],&lt;ref&gt;''Linguistics and Grammatology'' in ''Of Grammatology'', pp. 27–73&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]],&lt;ref name="FromRestricted"&gt;"From Restricted to General Economy: A Hegelianism without Reserve" in ''Writing and Difference''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]],&lt;ref name="Cogitothe"&gt;"Cogito and the History of Madness" in ''Writing and Difference''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]],&lt;ref name="FromRestricted" /&gt; [[René Descartes|Descartes]],&lt;ref name="Cogitothe" /&gt; anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Violence of the Letter: From Lévi-Strauss to Rousseau'' in ''Of Grammatology'', pp. 101–140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences" in ''Writing and Difference''&lt;/ref&gt; paleontologist [[André Leroi-Gourhan|Leroi-Gourhan]],&lt;ref&gt;''Of Grammatology'', pp. 83–86.&lt;/ref&gt; psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]],&lt;ref&gt;"Freud and the Scene of Writing" in ''Writing and Difference''&lt;/ref&gt; and writers such as [[Edmond Jabès|Jabès]]&lt;ref&gt;"Edmond Jabès and the Question of the Book" and "Ellipsis" in ''Writing and Difference'', pp. 64-78 and 295-300.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Antonin Artaud|Artaud]].&lt;ref&gt;"La Parole soufflée" and "The Theater of Cruelty and the Closure of Representation" in ''Writing and Difference''&lt;/ref&gt;

This collection of three books published in 1967 elaborated Derrida's theoretical framework. Derrida attempts to approach the very heart of the [[Western intellectual tradition]], characterizing this tradition as "a search for a transcendental being that serves as the origin or guarantor of meaning". The attempt to "ground the meaning relations constitutive of the world in an instance that itself lies outside all relationality" was referred to by Heidegger as [[logocentrism]], and Derrida argues that the philosophical enterprise is ''essentially'' logocentric,&lt;ref name="Lamont87"&gt;{{Cite journal | jstor=2780292| title=How to Become a Dominant French Philosopher: The Case of Jacques Derrida| journal=American Journal of Sociology| volume=93| issue=3| pages=584–622| last1=Lamont| first1=Michele| date=November 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that this is a [[paradigm]] inherited from Judaism and [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenism]].&lt;ref name="Borody98"/&gt; He in turn describes logocentrism as phallocratic, [[patriarchal]] and [[masculine|masculinist]].&lt;ref name="Borody98"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hélène Cixous]], [[Catherine Clément]] [1975] ''La jeune née''&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida contributed to "the understanding of certain deeply hidden philosophical presuppositions and prejudices in [[Western culture]]",&lt;ref name="Borody98"&gt;[http://www.nipissingu.ca/faculty/wayneb/ Wayne A.

In 1968, he published his influential essay "[[Plato's Pharmacy]]" in the French journal ''[[Tel Quel]]'' .&lt;ref name="Spurgin97"&gt;Spurgin, Tim (1997) [http://www.lawrence.edu/dept/english/courses/60a/handouts/pharmacy.html Reader's Guide to Derrida's "Plato's Pharmacy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224024836/http://www.lawrence.edu/dept/english/courses/60A/handouts/pharmacy.html |date=February 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff93"&gt;Graff (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; This essay was later collected in ''[[Dissemination (Derrida)|Dissemination]]'', one of three books published by Derrida in 1972, along with the essay collection ''Margins of Philosophy'' and the collection of interviews entitled ''[[Positions]]''.

===1973–1980===
Starting in 1972, Derrida produced on average more than one book per year. Derrida continued to produce important works, such as ''[[Glas (book)|Glas]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond]]'' (1980).

Derrida received increasing attention in the United States after 1972, where he was a regular visiting professor and lecturer at several major American universities. In the 1980s, during the [[American 1980s culture wars|American culture wars]], [[conservatives]] started a dispute over Derrida's influence and legacy upon American intellectuals,&lt;ref name="NationObituaries"/&gt; and claimed that he influenced American literary critics and theorists more than academic philosophers.&lt;ref name="Lamont87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansson"&gt;Sven Ove Hansson {{cite web|url=http://www.infra.kth.se/phil/theoria/editorial721.htm |title=''Philosophical Schools'' |accessdate=2008-02-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718054747/http://www.infra.kth.se/phil/theoria/editorial721.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2006 |df= }} – Editorial From Theoria'' vol. 72, Part 1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=August 2010}}

===''Of Spirit'' (1987)===
On March 14, 1987, Derrida presented at the CIPH conference titled "Heidegger: Open Questions" a lecture which was published in October 1987 as ''Of Spirit: Heidegger and the Question''. It follows the shifting role of ''Geist'' (spirit) through Heidegger's work, noting that, in 1927, "spirit" was one of the philosophical terms that Heidegger set his sights on dismantling.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida (1989) ''Of Spirit'', pp.vii-1&lt;/ref&gt; With his Nazi political engagement in 1933, however, Heidegger came out as a champion of the "German Spirit," and only withdrew from an exalting interpretation of the term in 1953. Derrida asks, "What of this meantime?"&lt;ref&gt;Derrida (1989) ''Of Spirit'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; His book connects in a number of respects with his long engagement of Heidegger (such as "The Ends of Man" in ''Margins of Philosophy'', his Paris seminar on philosophical nationality and nationalism in the mid-1980s, and the essays published in English as ''Geschlecht'' and ''Geschlecht II'').&lt;ref&gt;Derrida (1989) ''Of Spirit'', p. 7, 11, 117–118&lt;/ref&gt; He considers "four guiding threads" of Heideggerian philosophy that form "the knot of this ''Geflecht'' [braid]": "the question of the question," "the essence of technology," "the discourse of animality," and "epochality" or "the hidden teleology or the narrative order."&lt;ref&gt;Derrida (1989) ''Of Spirit'', pp. 8–12&lt;/ref&gt;

''Of Spirit'' is an important contribution to the long debate on Heidegger's Nazism and appeared at the same time as the French publication of a book by a previously unknown Chilean writer, [[Victor Farias|Victor Farías]], who charged that Heidegger's philosophy amounted to a wholehearted endorsement of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) faction. Derrida responded to Farías in an interview, "Heidegger, the Philosopher's Hell" and a subsequent article, "Comment donner raison? How to Concede, with Reasons?" He called Farías a weak reader of Heidegger's thought, adding that much of the evidence Farías and his supporters touted as new had long been known within the philosophical community.&lt;ref&gt;Powell (2006), p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sbhlgspwVwMC&amp;pg=PA167 167].&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s: political and ethical themes===
Some have argued that Derrida's work took a "political turn" in the 1990s. Texts cited as evidence of such a turn include ''Force of Law'' (1990), as well as ''[[Specters of Marx]]'' (1994) and ''Politics of Friendship'' (1994). Others, however, including Derrida himself, have argued that much of the philosophical work done in his "political turn" can be dated to earlier essays.&lt;ref name="Martha C. Nussbaum 1990: 29, 227"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Nussbaum| first1 = Martha C.| title = Love's Knowledge: Essays on Philosophy and Literature| edition = 1st| year = 1990| publisher = Oxford University Press| location =  New York| isbn = 978-0195074857 | chapter = "Form and Content, Philosophy and Literature"| pages = 29 | chapter-url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/loves-knowledge-9780195074857| quote = "[He] chose to address the American Philosophical Association on the topic of Aristotle's theory of friendship ("Journal of Philosophy" 85 (1988), 632-44); Barbara Johnson's "A World of Difference" (Baltimore, 1987) argues that Deconstruction can make valuable ethical and social contributions; and in general there seems to be a return to the ethical and practical...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida develops an ethicist view respecting to hospitality, exploring the idea that two types of hospitalities exist, conditional and unconditional. Though this contributed to the works of many scholars, Derrida was seriously criticized for this.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, R. (1995). Habermas, Derrida, and the functions of philosophy. Revue internationale de philosophie, 49(194 (4), 437-459.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, R. (1989). Is Derrida a transcendental philosopher?.

Those who argue Derrida engaged in an "ethical turn" refer to works such as ''The Gift of Death'' as evidence that he began more directly applying deconstruction to the relationship between ethics and religion. In this work, Derrida interprets passages from the Bible, particularly on [[Abraham]] and the [[Binding of Isaac|Sacrifice of Isaac]],&lt;ref&gt;Jack Reynolds, Jonathan Roffe (2004) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=D7jq50nVzGAC Understanding Derrida]'' p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gift of Death'', pp. 57–72&lt;/ref&gt;  and from [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s ''[[Fear and Trembling]]''. Derrida's contemporary readings of [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Carl Schmitt]], [[Jan Patočka]], on themes such as law, justice, responsibility, and friendship, had a significant impact on fields beyond philosophy. Derrida and Deconstruction influenced aesthetics, literary criticism, architecture, [[film theory]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[historiography]], law, [[psychoanalysis]], [[theology]], [[feminism]], gay and lesbian studies and political theory. [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], [[Richard Rorty]], [[Geoffrey Hartman]], [[Harold Bloom]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Hélène Cixous]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Duncan Kennedy (legal philosopher)|Duncan Kennedy]], [[Gary Peller]], [[Drucilla Cornell]], [[Alan Hunt (professor)|Alan Hunt]], [[Hayden White]], [[Mario Kopić]], and [[Alun Munslow]] are some of the authors who have been influenced by deconstruction.

Derrida delivered a eulogy at Levinas' funeral, later published as ''Adieu à Emmanuel Lévinas'', an appreciation and exploration of Levinas's moral philosophy. Derrida used [[Bracha L. Ettinger]]'s interpretation of Lévinas' notion of femininity and transformed his own earlier reading of this subject respectively.&lt;ref&gt;B. L. Ettinger in conversation with Emmanuel Lévinas, "Que dirait Eurydice?" / "What would Eurydice Say?" (1991-93). Reprinted to coincide with Kabinet exhibition at Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam. Paris: BLE Atelier, 1997. This is a reprint of Le féminin est cette différence inouïe (Livre d'artiste, 1994, and it includes the text of Time is the Breath of the Spirit, MOMA, Oxford, 1993.) Reprinted in Athena: Philosophical Studies. Vol. 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrida continued to produce readings of literature, writing extensively on [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Paul Celan]], and others.

In 1991 he published ''The Other Heading'', in which he discussed the concept of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] (as in [[cultural identity]], [[European identity]], and [[national identity]]), in the name of which in Europe have been unleashed "the worst violences," "the crimes of xenophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, religious or nationalist fanaticism."&lt;ref&gt;''The Other Heading'', pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1997 [[Centre culturel international de Cerisy-la-Salle|Cerisy Conference]], Derrida delivered a ten-hour address on the subject of "the autobiographical animal" entitled [[The Animal That Therefore I Am (More To Follow)]]. Engaging with questions surrounding the ontology of nonhuman animals, the ethics of animal slaughter and the difference between humans and other animals, the address has been seen as initiating a late "animal turn" in Derrida's philosophy, although Derrida himself has said that his interest in animals is, in fact, present in his earliest writings.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida (2008), 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Work of Mourning'' (1981–2001)===
Beginning with "The Deaths of Roland Barthes" in 1981, Derrida produced a series of texts on mourning and memory occasioned by the loss of his friends and colleagues, many of them new engagements with their work. ''Memoires for Paul de Man'', a book-length lecture series presented first at Yale and then at Irvine as Derrida's Wellek Lecture, followed in 1986, with a revision in 1989 that included "Like the Sound of the Sea Deep Within a Shell: Paul de Man's War". Ultimately, fourteen essays were collected into ''The Work of Mourning'' (2001), which was expanded in the 2003 French edition, ''Chaque fois unique, la fin du monde'' (literally, "The end of the world, unique each time"), to include essays dedicated to [[Gérard Granel]] and Maurice Blanchot.

===2002===
In October 2002, at the theatrical opening of the film ''[[Derrida (film)|Derrida]]'', he said that, in many ways, he felt more and more close to [[Guy Debord]]'s work, and that this closeness appears in Derrida's texts. Derrida mentioned, in particular, "everything I say about the media, technology, the spectacle, and the 'criticism of the show', so to speak, and the markets – the becoming-a-spectacle of everything, and the exploitation of the spectacle."&lt;ref name="Derrida02Q&amp;A"&gt;Derrida (2002) Q&amp;A session at Film Forum&lt;/ref&gt; Among the places in which Derrida mentions the ''[[Spectacle (critical theory)|Spectacle]]'', is a 1997 interview about the notion of the intellectual.&lt;ref name="Derrida 97 Intellectuels p39"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Derrida|origyear = 1997|title = Les Intellectuels|year = 2005|pages = 39–40|language = French|postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Politics==
{{Prose|section|date=March 2018}}
Derrida engaged with many political issues, movements, and debates:
* Although Derrida participated in the rallies of the [[May 1968 protests]], and organized the first general assembly at the ''École Normale Superieure'', he said "I was on my guard, even worried in the face of a certain cult of spontaneity, a fusionist, anti-unionist euphoria, in the face of the enthusiasm of a finally "freed" speech, of restored "transparence," and so forth."&lt;ref name="Derrida91MagLitEwald"&gt;Derrida (1991) ''"A 'Madness' Must Watch Over Thinking"'', pp. 347–9.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[May '68]], he met frequently with [[Maurice Blanchot]].&lt;ref&gt;Bennington (1991), p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;
* He registered his objections to the [[Vietnam War]] in delivering "The Ends of Man" in the United States.
* In 1977, he was among the intellectuals, with Foucault and Althusser, who signed the [[French petition against age of consent laws|petition against age of consent laws]].
* In 1981 Derrida, on the prompting of [[Roger Scruton]] and others, founded the French Jan Hus association with structuralist historian [[Jean-Pierre Vernant]]. Its purpose was to aid dissident or persecuted Czech intellectuals. Derrida became vice-president.&lt;ref name="Powell06p151"&gt;Powell (2006), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;
* In late 1981 he was arrested by the [[Czechoslovakia]]n government upon leading a conference in [[Prague]] that lacked government authorization, and charged with the "production and trafficking of drugs", which he claimed were planted as he visited Kafka's grave. He was released (or "expelled", as the Czechoslovakian government put it) after the interventions of the [[François Mitterrand|Mitterrand]] government, and the assistance of Michel Foucault, returning to Paris on January 1, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, "'To Do Justice to Freud': The History of Madness in the Age of Psychoanalysis," ''Resistances of Psychoanalysis'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998) pp. 70–1.&lt;/ref&gt;
* He registered his concerns against the proliferation of nuclear weapons in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, Jacques. "No Apocalypse, Not Now (full speed ahead, seven missiles, seven missives)". Diacritics, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;
* He was active in cultural activities against the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|Apartheid government of South Africa]] and on behalf of [[Nelson Mandela]] beginning in 1983.
* He met with [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] intellectuals during a 1988 visit to [[Jerusalem]].
* He protested against the death penalty, dedicating his seminar in his last years to the production of a non-[[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] argument for its abolition, and was active in the campaign to free [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]].
* Derrida was not known to have participated in any conventional electoral [[political party]] until 1995, when he joined a committee in support of [[Lionel Jospin]]'s [[French Socialist Party|Socialist]] candidacy, although he expressed misgivings about such organizations going back to [[French Communist Party|Communist]] organizational efforts while he was a student at ENS.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* In the [[French presidential election, 2002|2002 French presidential election]] he refused to vote in the run-off between far-right candidate [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] and center-right [[Jacques Chirac]], citing a lack of acceptable choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qXmrAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT437&amp;dq=derrida%20and%20the%202002%20presidential%20election&amp;pg=PT437#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Derrida: A Biography|last=Peeters|first=Benoit|date=2013-08-27|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780745663029|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* While supportive of the American government in the wake of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|the terrorist attacks of 9/11]], he opposed the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] (see ''Rogues'' and his contribution to ''Philosophy in a Time of Terror'' with [[Giovanna Borradori]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]]).

Beyond these explicit political interventions, however, Derrida was engaged in rethinking politics and the political itself, within and beyond philosophy. Derrida insisted that a distinct political undertone had pervaded his texts from the very beginning of his career. Nevertheless, the attempt to understand the political implications of notions of responsibility, [[reason of state]], the other, decision, [[sovereignty]], Europe, friendship, difference, faith, and so on, became much more marked from the early 1990s on. By 2000, theorizing "democracy to come," and thinking the limitations of existing democracies, had become important concerns.

==Influences on Derrida==
Crucial readings in his adolescence were [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s ''[[Reveries of a Solitary Walker]]'' and ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'', [[André Gide]]'s journal, ''[[La porte étroite]]'', ''[[Les nourritures terrestres]]'' and ''[[The Immoralist]]'';&lt;ref name="TeenBooks"/&gt; and the works of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref name="TeenBooks"&gt;Derrida (1989) ''This Strange Institution Called Literature'', pp. 35, 38–9&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''Families, I hate you!'' in particular, which inspired Derrida as an adolescent, is a famous verse from Gide's ''Les nourritures terrestres'', book IV.&lt;ref&gt;Gide's ''Les nourritures terrestres'', book IV: «Familles, je vous hais! Foyers clos; portes refermées; possessions jalouses du bonheur.»&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1991 interview Derrida commented on a similar verse, also from book IV of the same Gide work: "I hated the homes, the families, all the places where man thinks to find rest" (''Je haïssais les foyers, les familles, tous lieux où l'homme pense trouver un repos'').&lt;ref&gt;1991 Interview with [[Francois Ewald]] ''Wahn muß übers Denken wachen'' published in: Werner Kolk (Translator). Literataz. 1992, p. 1-2. (German), as quoted in http://escholarship.org/uc/item/3891m6db#page-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influences upon Derrida are [[Martin Heidegger]],&lt;ref name="67RonseP8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LetterJap"/&gt; [[Plato]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Alexandre Kojève]], [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Georges Bataille]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Emmanuel Lévinas]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[James Joyce]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[J. L. Austin]]&lt;ref name="Afterword88P130"&gt;Derrida (1988) ''Afterword'', pp. 130–1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fPYL_NP-wskC&amp;lpg=PA217&amp;dq=derrida%20and%20St%C3%A9phane%20Mallarm%C3%A9.&amp;pg=PA217#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Stéphane Mallarmé|last=Pearson|first=Roger|date=2010-05-15|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=9781861897275|location=|pages=217|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peers and contemporaries==
Derrida's philosophical friends, allies, students  and the heirs of Derrida's thought include [[Paul de Man]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], [[Sarah Kofman]], [[Hélène Cixous]], [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[Alexander García Düttmann]], Joseph Cohen, [[Geoffrey Bennington]], [[Jean-Luc Marion]], [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]], Raphael Zagury-Orly, [[Jacques Ehrmann]], [[Avital Ronell]], [[Judith Butler]], [[Béatrice Galinon-Mélénec]], [[Ernesto Laclau]], [[Samuel Weber]] and [[Catherine Malabou]].

===Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe===
[[Jean-Luc Nancy]] and [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]] were among Derrida's first students in France and went on to become well-known and important philosophers in their own right. Despite their considerable differences of subject, and often also of a method, they continued their close interaction with each other and with Derrida, from the early 1970s.

Derrida wrote on both of them, including a long book on Nancy: ''Le Toucher, Jean-Luc Nancy'' (''On Touching—Jean-Luc Nancy'', 2005).

===Paul de Man===
{{Main|Paul de Man}}

Derrida's most prominent friendship in intellectual life was with Paul de Man, which began with their meeting at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and continued until de Man's death in 1983. De Man provided a somewhat different approach to deconstruction, and his readings of literary and philosophical texts were crucial in the training of a generation of readers.

Shortly after de Man's death, Derrida authored a book ''Memoires: pour Paul de Man'' and in 1988 wrote an article in the journal ''[[Critical Inquiry]]'' called "Like the Sound of the Sea Deep Within a Shell: Paul de Man's War". The memoir became cause for controversy, because shortly before Derrida published his piece, it had been discovered by the Belgian literary critic Ortwin de Graef that long before his academic career in the US, de Man had written almost two hundred essays in a pro-Nazi newspaper during the [[History of Belgium#World War II|German occupation of Belgium]], including several that were explicitly [[antisemitic]].

Derrida complicated the notion that it is possible to simply read de Man's later scholarship through the prism of these earlier political essays. Rather, any claims about de Man's work should be understood in relation to the entire body of his scholarship. Critics of Derrida have argued that he minimizes the antisemitic character of de Man's writing. Some critics have found Derrida's treatment of this issue surprising, given that, for example, Derrida also spoke out against antisemitism and, in the 1960s, broke with the Heidegger disciple [[Jean Beaufret]] over Beaufret's instances of antisemitism, about which Derrida (and, after him, [[Maurice Blanchot]]) expressed shock.

===Michel Foucault===
Derrida's criticism of [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] appears in the essay ''Cogito and the History of Madness'' (from ''Writing and Difference''). It was first given as a lecture on March 4, 1963, at a conference at [[Jean Wahl|Wahl]]'s ''[[Collège philosophique]]'', which Foucault attended, and caused a rift between the two men that was never fully mended.&lt;ref name="Powell06p34-5"&gt;Powell (2006) pp. 34–5&lt;/ref&gt;

In an appendix added to the 1972 edition of his ''History of Madness'', Foucault disputed Derrida's interpretation of his work, and accused Derrida of practicing "a historically well-determined little pedagogy [...] which teaches the student that there is nothing outside the text [...]. A pedagogy which inversely gives to the voice of the masters that infinite sovereignty that allows it indefinitely to re-say the text."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel, ''History of Madness'', ed. Jean Khalfa, trans. Jonathan Murphy and Jean Khalfa (London: Routledge, 2006), p. xxiv,573.&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Carlo Ginzburg]], Foucault may have written ''[[The Order of Things]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'' partly under the stimulus of Derrida's criticism.&lt;ref name="GinzburgNihilism"&gt;Carlo Ginzburg [1976], ''Il formaggio e i vermi'', translated in 1980 as ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4IUREWq_o3MC The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller]'', trans. Anne Tedeschi (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), xviii. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-4387-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlo Ginzburg briefly labeled Derrida's criticism in ''Cogito and the History of Madness'', as "facile, nihilistic objections," without giving further argumentation.&lt;ref name="GinzburgNihilism"/&gt;

===Derrida's translators===
[[Geoffrey Bennington]], [[Avital Ronell]] and [[Samuel Weber]] belong to a group of Derrida translators. Many of Derrida's translators are esteemed thinkers in their own right. Derrida often worked in a collaborative arrangement, allowing his prolific output to be translated into English in a timely fashion.

Having started as a student of de Man, [[Gayatri Spivak]] took on the translation of ''Of Grammatology'' early in her career and has since revised it into a second edition. [[Barbara Johnson]]'s translation of Derrida's ''Dissemination'' was published by The Athlone Press in 1981. Alan Bass was responsible for several early translations; Bennington and [[Peggy Kamuf]] have continued to produce translations of his work for nearly twenty years. In recent years, a number of translations have appeared by Michael Naas (also a Derrida scholar) and Pascale-Anne Brault.

Bennington, Brault, Kamuf, Naas, Elizabeth Rottenberg, and [[David Wills (writer)|David Wills]] are currently engaged in translating Derrida's previously unpublished seminars, which span from 1959 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derridaseminars.org/team.html |title=Derrida Seminar Translation Project |publisher=Derridaseminars.org |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Volumes I and II of ''The Beast and the Sovereign'' (presenting Derrida's seminars from December 12, 2001 to March 27, 2002 and from December 11, 2002 to March 26, 2003), as well as ''The Death Penalty, Volume I'' (covering December 8, 1999 to March 22, 2000), have appeared in English translation.  Further volumes currently projected for the series include ''Heidegger: The Question of Being and History'' (1964-1965), ''Death Penalty, Volume II'' (2000–2001), ''Perjury and Pardon, Volume I'' (1997–1998), and ''Perjury and Pardon, Volume II'' (1998–1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derridaseminars.org/volumes.html |title=Derrida Seminar Translation Project |publisher=Derridaseminars.org |accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Bennington, Derrida undertook the challenge published as ''Jacques Derrida'', an arrangement in which Bennington attempted to provide a systematic explication of Derrida's work (called the "Derridabase") using the top two-thirds of every page, while Derrida was given the finished copy of every Bennington chapter and the bottom third of every page in which to show how deconstruction exceeded Bennington's account (this was called the "Circumfession"). Derrida seems to have viewed Bennington in particular as a kind of rabbinical explicator, noting at the end of the "Applied Derrida" conference, held at the University of Luton in 1995 that: "everything has been said and, as usual, Geoff Bennington has said everything before I have even opened my mouth. I have the challenge of trying to be unpredictable after him, which is impossible... so I'll try to pretend to be unpredictable after Geoff. Once again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hydra.humanities.uci.edu/Derrida/applied.html |title=Lovely Luton |publisher=Hydra.humanities.uci.edu |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marshall McLuhan===
Derrida was familiar with the work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], and since his early 1967 writings (''Of Grammatology'', ''Speech and Phenomena''), he speaks of language as a "medium,"&lt;ref&gt;''Speech and Phenomena'', Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; of phonetic writing as "the medium of the great metaphysical, scientific, technical, and economic adventure of the West."&lt;ref&gt;''Of Grammatology'', Part I.1&lt;/ref&gt;

He expressed his disagreement with McLuhan in regard to what Derrida called McLuhan's ideology about the end of writing.&lt;ref name="Poster2010"&gt;Poster (2010), pp. 3–4, 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1982 interview, he said:

{{quote|I think that there is an ideology in McLuhan's discourse that I don't agree with because he's an optimist as to the possibility of restoring an oral community which would get rid of the writing machines and so on. I think that's a very traditional myth which goes back to... let's say Plato, Rousseau... And instead of thinking that we are living at the end of writing, I think that in another sense we are living in the extension – the overwhelming extension – of writing. At least in the new sense... I don't mean the alphabetic writing down, but in the new sense of those writing machines that we're using now (e.g. the tape recorder). And this is writing too.&lt;ref name="Brennan82"&gt;Derrida [1982] [http://www.dhspriory.org/kenny/PhilTexts/Derrida/Excuse.htm ''Excuse me, but I never said exactly so: Yet Another Derridean Interview''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413130756/http://www.dhspriory.org/kenny/PhilTexts/Derrida/Excuse.htm |date=April 13, 2016 }}, with Paul Brennan, ''On the Beach'' (Glebe NSW, Australia). No.1/1983: p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And in his 1972 essay ''Signature Event Context'' he said:

{{quote|As writing, communication, if one insists upon maintaining the word, is not the means of transport of sense, the exchange of intentions and meanings, the discourse and "communication of consciousnesses." We are not witnessing an end of writing which, to follow McLuhan's ideological representation, would restore a transparency or immediacy of social relations; but indeed a more and more powerful historical unfolding of a general writing of which the system of speech, consciousness, meaning, presence, truth, etc., would only be an effect, to be analyzed as such. It is this questioned effect that I have elsewhere called ''logocentrism''.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida 1972 ''Signature Event Context''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticism==

===Criticism from Marxists===

===Criticism from analytic philosophers===
Though Derrida addressed the [[American Philosophical Association]] on at least one occasion in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first = Newton|last = Garver|year = 1991|url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/k7413027q612127k/|title = Derrida's language-games|volume = 10|pages = 187–98|doi = 10.1007/BF00141339|issue = 2|journal = Topoi|postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

D'Ulisse, ''[http://www.newpartisan.com/home/derrida-1930-2004.html Derrida (1930–2004)]'', ''New Partisan'', December 24, 2004. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310180410/http://www.newpartisan.com/home/derrida-1930-2004.html |date=March 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[pseudophilosophy]] or [[sophistry]].

Some [[analytic philosopher]]s have in fact claimed, since at least the 1980s, that Derrida's work is "not philosophy." One of the main arguments they gave was alleging that Derrida's influence had not been on US philosophy departments but on literature and other [[humanities]] disciplines.&lt;ref name="Lamont87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansson"/&gt;

In his 1989 ''[[Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity]]'', [[Richard Rorty]] argues that Derrida (especially in his book, ''[[The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond]]'', one section of which is an experiment in fiction) purposefully uses words that cannot be defined (e.g., ''[[différance]]''), and uses previously definable words in contexts diverse enough to make understanding impossible, so that the reader will never be able to contextualize Derrida's literary self. Rorty, however, argues that this intentional obfuscation is philosophically grounded. In garbling his message Derrida is attempting to escape the naïve, positive metaphysical projects of his predecessors.&lt;ref name= a&gt;Rorty, Richard. ''Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-521-36781-6}}. Ch. 6: "From ironist theory to private allusions: Derrida"&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Sir [[Roger Scruton]] wrote in 2004, "He's difficult to summarise because it's nonsense. He argues that the meaning of a sign is never revealed in the sign but deferred indefinitely and that a sign only means something by virtue of its difference from something else. For Derrida, there is no such thing as meaning – it always eludes us and therefore anything goes."&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/12/philosophy|title=Deconstructing Jacques|date=12 October 2004|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Derrida's scholarship and writing style, [[Noam Chomsky]] wrote "I found the scholarship appalling, based on pathetic misreading; and the argument, such as it was, failed to come close to the kinds of standards I've been familiar with since virtually childhood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Chomsky | first = Noam | title = Postmodernism? | website = ZCommunications | url = http://zcomm.org/znetarticle/postmodernism-by-noam-chomsky/ | accessdate = 27 September 2014 | date=August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul R. Gross]] and [[Norman Levitt]] also criticized his work for misusing scientific terms and concepts in ''[[Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science]]'' (1994).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Three quarrels (or disputes) in particular went out of academic circles and received international mass media coverage: the 1972–88 quarrel with John Searle, the analytic philosophers' pressures on Cambridge University not to award Derrida an honorary degree, and a dispute with Richard Wolin and the NYRB.

====Searle–Derrida debate&lt;!--linked from 'John Searle'--&gt;====
{{main|Searle–Derrida debate}}
{{also|Limited Inc}}
In the early 1970s, Searle had a brief exchange with Jacques Derrida regarding speech-act theory. The exchange was characterized by a degree of mutual hostility between the philosophers, each of whom accused the other of having misunderstood his basic points.&lt;ref name=limitedinc&gt;Derrida, Jacques. ''Limited, Inc.'' Northwestern University Press, 1988. p. 29: "...I have read some of his [Searle's] work (more, in any case, than he seems to have read of mine)"&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;!--Footnote provided only sources half the claim.--&gt; Searle was particularly hostile to Derrida's [[deconstruction]]ist framework and much later refused to let his response to Derrida be printed along with Derrida's papers in the 1988 collection ''[[Limited Inc]]''. Searle did not consider Derrida's approach to be legitimate philosophy or even intelligible writing and argued that he did not want to legitimize the deconstructionist point of view by dedicating any attention to it. Consequently, some critics&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, Ian. 2004. "''un dialogue de sourds?'' Some implications of the Austin–Searle–Derrida debate", in ''Jacques Derrida: critical thought''. Ian Maclachlan (ed.) Ashgate Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; have considered the exchange to be a series of elaborate misunderstandings rather than a debate, while others&lt;ref name="Alfino"&gt;{{Cite journal | jstor=40237667| title=Another Look at the Derrida-Searle Debate| journal=Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric| volume=24| issue=2| pages=143–152| last1=Alfino| first1=Mark| year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; have seen either Derrida or Searle gaining the upper hand. The level of hostility can be seen from Searle's statement that "It would be a mistake to regard Derrida's discussion of Austin as a confrontation between two prominent philosophical traditions", to which Derrida replied that that sentence was "the only sentence of the "reply" to which I can subscribe".&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Glendinning]]. 2001. ''Arguing with Derrida''. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators have frequently interpreted the exchange as a prominent example of a confrontation between [[Analytical philosophy|analytical]] and [[continental philosophy]].

The debate began in 1972, when, in his paper  "Signature Event Context", Derrida analyzed J. L. Austin's theory of the [[illocutionary act]]. While sympathetic to Austin's departure from a purely denotational account of language to one that includes "force", Derrida was sceptical of the framework of normativity employed by Austin. He argued that Austin had missed the fact that any speech event is framed by a "structure of absence" (the words that are left unsaid due to contextual constraints) and by "iterability" (the constraints on what can be said, given by what has been said in the past). Derrida argued that the focus on [[intentionality]] in speech-act theory was misguided because intentionality is restricted to that which is already established as a possible intention. He also took issue with the way Austin had excluded the study of fiction, non-serious or "parasitic" speech, wondering whether this exclusion was because Austin had considered these speech genres governed by different structures of meaning, or simply due to a lack of interest. In his brief reply to Derrida, "Reiterating the Differences: A Reply to Derrida", Searle argued that Derrida's critique was unwarranted because it assumed that Austin's theory attempted to give a full account of language and meaning when its aim was much narrower. Searle considered the omission of parasitic discourse forms to be justified by the narrow scope of Austin's inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Campbell. 1993. "John R. Searle" in Irene Rima Makaryk (ed). Encyclopedia of contemporary literary theory: approaches, scholars, terms. University of Toronto Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Searle, "Reiterating the Différences: A Reply to Derrida", Glyph 2 (Baltimore MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Searle agreed with Derrida's proposal that intentionality presupposes iterability, but did not apply the same concept of intentionality used by Derrida, being unable or unwilling to engage with the continental conceptual apparatus.&lt;ref name="Alfino" /&gt; This, in turn, caused Derrida to criticize Searle for not being sufficiently familiar with [[wikt:phenomenological|phenomenological]] perspectives on intentionality.&lt;ref name="Hobson"&gt;Marian Hobson. 1998. Jacques Derrida: opening lines. Psychology Press. pp. 95-97&lt;/ref&gt; Searle also argued that Derrida's disagreement with Austin turned on his having misunderstood Austin's [[type–token distinction]] and his failure to understand Austin's concept of failure in relation to [[performativity]]. Some critics&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; have suggested that Searle, by being so grounded in the analytical tradition that he was unable to engage with Derrida's continental phenomenological tradition, was at fault for the unsuccessful nature of the exchange.

The substance of Searle's criticism of Derrida in relation to topics in the [[philosophy of language]]—referenced in Derrida's ''Signature Event Context''—was that Derrida had no apparent familiarity with contemporary philosophy of language nor of contemporary linguistics in Anglo-Saxon countries.  Searle explains, "When Derrida writes about the philosophy of language he refers typically to [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], not to mention [[Plato]]. And his idea of a "modern linguist" is [[Émile Benveniste|Benveniste]] or even [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]."&lt;ref name="Searle 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Searle | first1 = John R. | title = Literary Theory and Its Discontents | journal = Journal of Humanistic Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 637–67 | year = 1994 | jstor = 469470 | doi=10.2307/469470}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Searle describes Derrida's philosophical knowledge as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|pre-Wittgensteinian]]—that is to say, disconnected from analytic tradition—and consequently, in his perspective, naive and misguided, concerned with issues long-since resolved or otherwise found to be ''non''-issues.&lt;ref name="Searle 1994"/&gt;

Searle also wrote in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' that he was surprised by "the low level of philosophical argumentation, the deliberate obscurantism of the prose, the wildly exaggerated claims, and the constant striving to give the appearance of profundity by making claims that seem paradoxical, but under analysis often turn out to be silly or trivial."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Searle | first = John R. | others =  | title = The Word Turned Upside Down | journal = The New York Review of Books | url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1983/oct/27/the-word-turned-upside-down/ | date = 27 October 1983 | accessdate = 21 August 2013 | archiveurl =  https://web.archive.org/web/20121013010523/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1983/oct/27/the-word-turned-upside-down/ | archivedate=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrida, in his response to Searle ({{nowrap|"a b c ..."}} in ''Limited Inc''), ridiculed Searle's positions. Claiming that a clear sender of Searle's message could not be established, he suggested that Searle had formed with Austin a ''société à responsabilité limitée'' (a "[[limited liability company]]") due to the ways in which the ambiguities of authorship within Searle's reply circumvented the very speech act of his reply. Searle did not reply. Later in 1988, Derrida tried to review his position and his critiques of Austin and Searle, reiterating that he found the constant appeal to "normality" in the analytical tradition to be problematic from which they were only paradigmatic examples.&lt;ref name="Alfino" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Afterwordsp133"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.1988.tb00701.x|title = Iterability and Meaning: The Searle-Derrida Debate| journal=Metaphilosophy| volume=19| pages=53–64|year = 1988|last1 = Farrell|first1 = Frank B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In the description of the structure called "normal," "normative," "central," "ideal," this possibility must be integrated as an essential possibility. The possibility cannot be treated as though it were a simple accident-marginal or parasitic. It cannot be, and hence ought not to be, and this passage from can to ought reflects the entire difficulty. In the analysis of so-called normal cases, one neither can nor ought, in all theoretical rigor, to exclude the possibility of transgression. Not even provisionally, or out of allegedly methodological considerations. It would be a poor method, since this possibility of transgression tells us immediately and indispensable about the structure of the act said to be normal as well as about the structure of law in general.}}

He continued arguing how problematic was establishing the relation between "nonfiction or standard discourse" and "fiction," defined as its "parasite", "for part of the most original essence of the latter is to allow fiction, the simulacrum, parasitism, to take place-and in so doing to 'de-essentialize' itself as it were".&lt;ref name="Afterwordsp133"&gt;Jacques Derrida, "Afterwords" in ''Limited, Inc.'' (Northwestern University Press, 1988), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; 
He would finally argue that the indispensable question would then become:&lt;ref name="Afterwordsp133" /&gt;
{{quote|what is "nonfiction standard discourse," what must it be and what does this name evoke, once its fictionality or its fictionalization, its transgressive "parasitism," is always possible (and moreover by virtue of the very same words, the same phrases, the same grammar, etc.)?  This question is all the more indispensable since the rules, and even the statements of the rules governing the relations of "nonfiction standard discourse" and its fictional "parasites," are not things found in nature, but laws, symbolic inventions, or conventions, institutions that, in their very normality as well as in their normativity, entail something of the fictional.}}

In the debate, Derrida praises Austin's work but argues that he is wrong to banish what Austin calls "infelicities" from the "normal" operation of language. One "infelicity," for instance, occurs when it cannot be known whether a given speech act is "sincere" or "merely citational" (and therefore possibly ironic, etc.). Derrida argues that every iteration is necessarily "citational," due to the graphematic nature of speech and writing, and that language could not work at all without the ever-present and ineradicable possibility of such alternate readings. Derrida takes Searle to task for his attempt to get around this issue by grounding final authority in the speaker's inaccessible "intention". Derrida argues that intention cannot possibly govern how an iteration signifies, once it becomes hearable or readable.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} All speech acts borrow a language whose significance is determined by historical-linguistic context, and by the alternate possibilities that this context makes possible. This significance, Derrida argues, cannot be altered or governed by the whims of intention.

In 1994, Searle argued that the ideas upon which ''deconstruction'' is founded are essentially a consequence of a series of conceptual confusions made by Derrida as a result of his outdated knowledge or are merely banalities.  He insisted that Derrida's conception of ''iterability'' and its alleged "corrupting" effect on meaning stems from Derrida's ignorance of the [[type–token distinction]] that exists in current [[linguistics]] and [[philosophy of language]].  As Searle explains, "Most importantly, from the fact that different tokens of a sentence type can be uttered on different occasions with different intentions, that is, different speaker meanings, nothing of any significance follows about the original speaker meaning of the original utterance token."&lt;ref name="Searle 1994"/&gt;

In 1995, Searle gave a brief reply to Derrida in ''The Construction of Social Reality''. He called Derrida's conclusion "preposterous" and stated that "Derrida, as far as I can tell, does not have an argument. He simply declares that there is nothing outside of texts..."&lt;ref&gt;Searle ''The Construction of Social Reality'' (1995) pp. 157–160.&lt;/ref&gt; Searle's reference here is not to anything forwarded in the debate, but to a mistranslation of the phrase "''il n'y a pas dehors du texte''" ("there is no outside-text"), which appears in Derrida's ''[[Of Grammatology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tr. by [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]. Johns Hopkins University Press. Baltimore, 1976, 158–59&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Searle, the consistent pattern of Derrida's rhetoric is: 
&lt;br&gt;(a) announce a preposterous thesis, e.g. "there is no outside-text" (''il n'y a pas de hors-texte''); 
&lt;br&gt;(b) when challenged on ''(a)'' respond that you have been misunderstood and revise the claim in ''(a)'' such that it becomes a truism, e.g. "'''il n'y a pas de hors-texte''{{'}} means nothing else: there is nothing outside contexts";&lt;ref name="Derrida LI"&gt;{{cite book| last1 =  Derrida| first1 = Jacques| title = Limited Inc.| edition = 1st| year = 1988| publisher = Northwestern University Press| location = Illinois| isbn = 978-0810107885| chapter = Afterword: Toward An Ethic of Discussion| page = 136| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-ANhg9zaAtIC| quote = The phrase which for some has become a sort of slogan, in general so badly understood, of deconstruction ("there is no outside-text" [it n y a pas de hors-texte]), means nothing else: there is nothing outside context. In this form, which says exactly the same thing, the formula would doubtless have been less shocking. I am not certain that it would have provided more to think about.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;(c) when the reformulation from ''(b)'' is acknowledged then proceed as if the ''original'' formulation from ''(a)'' was accepted.  The revised idea—for example—that ''everything exists in some context'' is a banality but a charade ensues as if the original claim—''nothing exists outside of text'' [''sic'']—had been established.

====Cambridge honorary doctorate====
In 1992 some academics at [[Cambridge University]], mostly not from the philosophy faculty, proposed that Derrida be awarded an honorary doctorate. This was opposed by, among others, the university's Professor of Philosophy, [[David Hugh Mellor|David Mellor]]. Eighteen other philosophers from US, Austrian, Australian, French, Polish, Italian, German, Dutch, Swiss, Spanish, and UK institutions, including [[Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)|Barry Smith]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]], and [[René Thom]], then sent a letter to Cambridge claiming that Derrida's work "does not meet accepted standards of clarity and rigour"&lt;!-- original spelling --&gt; and describing Derrida's philosophy as being composed of "tricks and gimmicks similar to those of the [[Dada]]ists."  The letter concluded that:

{{quote|... where coherent assertions are being made at all, these are either false or trivial. Academic status based on what seems to us to be little more than semi-intelligible attacks upon the values of reason, truth, and scholarship is not, we submit, sufficient grounds for the awarding of an honorary degree in a distinguished university.&lt;ref name="BarrySmithEtAl"&gt;Barry Smith et al., "Open letter against Derrida receiving an honorary doctorate from Cambridge University," ''The Times'' [London], 9 May 1992 [http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/varia/Derrida_Letter.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the end the protesters were outnumbered—336 votes to 204—when Cambridge put the motion to a vote;&lt;ref name="prelectur.stanford.edu"&gt;[[John Rawlings]] (1999) [http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/derrida/ Presidential Lectures: Jacques Derrida: Introduction] at [[Stanford University]]&lt;/ref&gt; though almost all of those who proposed Derrida and who voted in favour were not from the philosophy faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richmond|first1=Sarah|title=Derrida and Analytical Philosophy: Speech Acts and their Force|journal=European Journal of Philosophy|date=April 1996|volume=4|issue=1|pages=38–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida suggested in an interview that part of the reason for the attacks on his work, was that it questioned and modified "the rules of the dominant discourse, it tries to politicize and democratize education and the university scene."  To answer the question about the "exceptional violence," the compulsive "ferocity," and the "exaggeration" of the "attacks," he would say that these critics organize and practice in his case "a sort of obsessive personality cult which philosophers should know how to question and above all to moderate".&lt;ref name="Derrida 1995pp409-413"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Derrida| first1 = Jacques| title = Points . .: Interviews, 1974-1994| edition = 1st| year = 1995| publisher = Stanford University Press| location =  New York| isbn = 978-0810103979 | chapter = "Honoris Causa: 'This is also very funny'"| pages = 409–413 | chapter-url = http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/derrida/interviews.html#cambridge| quote = If it were only a question of "my" work, of the particular or isolated research of one individual, this wouldn't happen. Indeed, the violence of these denunciations derives from the fact that the work accused is part of a whole ongoing process. What is unfolding here, like the resistance it necessarily arouses, can't be limited to a personal "oeuvre," nor to a discipline, nor even to the academic institution. Nor in particular to a generation: it's often the active involvement of students and younger teachers which makes certain of our colleagues nervous to the point that they lose their sense of moderation and of the academic rules they invoke when they attack me and my work.  &lt;br&gt; If this work seems so threatening to them, this is because it isn't simply eccentric or strange, incomprehensible or exotic (which would allow them to dispose of it easily), but as I myself hope, and as they believe more than they admit, competent, rigorously argued, and carrying conviction in its re-examination of the fundamental norms and premises of a number of dominant discourses, the principles underlying many of their evaluations, the structures of academic institutions, and the research that goes on within them. What this kind of questioning does is modify the rules of the dominant discourse, it tries to politicize and democratize the university scene.&amp;nbsp;... &lt;br&gt; In short, to answer your question about the "exceptional violence," the compulsive "ferocity," and the "exaggeration" of the "attacks," I would say that these critics organize and practice in my case a sort of obsessive personality cult which philosophers should know how to question and above all to moderate.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dispute with Richard Wolin and the ''NYRB''====
[[Richard Wolin]] has argued since 1991 that Derrida's work, as well as that of Derrida's major inspirations (e.g., Bataille, Blanchot, Levinas, Heidegger, Nietzsche), leads to a corrosive [[nihilism]].{{Page needed|date=November 2010}} For example, Wolin argues that the "deconstructive gesture of overturning and reinscription ends up by threatening to efface many of the essential differences between Nazism and non-Nazism".&lt;ref name="Wolin93Preface"&gt;Richard Wolin, Preface to the MIT press edition: Note on a missing text. In R. Wolin (ed.) ''The Heidegger Controversy: A Critical Reader''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. 1993, p. xiii. {{ISBN|0-262-73101-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, when Wolin published a Derrida interview on Heidegger in the first edition of ''The Heidegger Controversy'', Derrida argued that the interview was an intentionally malicious mistranslation, which was "demonstrably execrable" and "weak, simplistic, and compulsively aggressive". As French law requires the consent of an author to translations and this consent was not given, Derrida insisted that the interview not appear in any subsequent editions or reprints. Columbia University Press subsequently refused to offer reprints or new editions. Later editions of ''The Heidegger Controversy'' by MIT Press also omitted the Derrida interview. The matter achieved public exposure owing to a friendly review of Wolin's book by the Heideggerian scholar [[Thomas Sheehan (academic)|Thomas Sheehan]] that appeared in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', in which Sheehan characterised Derrida's protests as an imposition of censorship. It was followed by an exchange of letters.&lt;ref name="NYRBLetters"&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2658 NYBooks.com: 2658] and  [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2591 NYBooks.com: 2591]&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida in turn responded to Sheehan and Wolin, in "The Work of Intellectuals and the Press (The Bad Example: How the New York Review of Books and Company do Business)", which was published in the book ''[[Points...]]''.&lt;ref name="DerridaOnNYRB"&gt;Derrida, "The Work of Intellectuals and the Press (The Bad Example: How the New York Review of Books and Company do Business)", published in the book ''[[Points...]]'' (1995; see the footnote about {{ISBN|0-226-14314-7}}, [[Jacques Derrida bibliography|here]]) (see also the [1992] French version ''[[Points de suspension: entretiens]]'' ({{ISBN|0-8047-2488-1}}) [[Jacques Derrida bibliography|there]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-four academics, belonging to different schools and groups – often in disagreement with each other and with deconstruction – signed a letter addressed to ''The New York Review of Books'', in which they expressed their indignation for the magazine's behaviour as well as that of Sheenan and Wolin.&lt;ref name="PointsP434"&gt;''Points'', p. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical obituaries===
Critical obituaries of Derrida were published in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist''. [http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3308320 Obituary: Jacques Derrida, French intellectual], October 21, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/why-i-wont-be-mourning-derrida-543574.html ''The Independent'']&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine ''[[The Nation]]'' responded to the ''New York Times'' obituary saying that "even though American papers had scorned and trivialized Derrida before, the tone seemed particularly caustic for an obituary of an internationally acclaimed philosopher who had profoundly influenced two generations of American humanities scholars."&lt;ref name="NationObituaries"&gt;Ross Benjamin ''[http://www.thenation.com/article/hostile-obituary-derrida Hostile Obituary for Derrida]'', [[The Nation]], November 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Culler08"&gt;[[Jonathan Culler]] (2008) ''[http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Jan08/JonathanCuller.html Why deconstruction still matters: A conversation with Jonathan Culler]'', interviewed by Paul Sawyer for ''The Cornell Chronicle'', January 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jules Ferry Laws''' are a set of French laws which established free education in 1881, then mandatory and [[Laïcité|laic]] (secular) education in 1882.  [[Jules Ferry]], a lawyer holding the office of Minister of Public Instruction in the 1880s, is widely credited for creating the modern Republican school (''l'école républicaine''). The dual system of state and church schools that were largely staffed by religious officials was replaced by state schools and lay school teachers. The educational reforms enacted by Jules Ferry are often attributed to a broader [[anti-clerical]] campaign in [[France]].

==History==

French education during the 19th century was marked by two distinct and segregated systems,  the first being a [[secondary school]] system and the second a [[primary school]] system.  However, in each of these systems, the [[Catholic Church]] provided an alternative to [[Secularity|secular]] schooling that was often the only option for families in economically depressed regions of France.

Although the [[Radical Party (France)|Republican]] party is often credited for inventing the concept of free primary school, it was, in fact, a series of progressive improvements since mid-century. For example, in 1698, it was decreed that children ages 7–14 were to attend local [[Catholic]] schools with certified instructors, which were also added to areas that previously had none.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, H.C.. Education and the French Revolution (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,1969)&lt;/ref&gt; However, funds for these schools were to be provided by local residents, and it proved very difficult for these schools to afford to remain in practice. Overall, between 1837 (44 years before the Jules Ferry Laws were passed) and 1906, the number of schools had increased by more than 100%. In some areas, like Bretagne Ouest, it reached nearly 200% (197.2%).&lt;ref&gt;Donald N. Baker and Patrick J. Harrigan, The Making of Frenchmen: Current Directions in the History of Education in France, 1679–1979 (Ontario: Historical Reflections Press, 1980), 143–205&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of national government support for popular education and teacher training first became apparent as an important social and political issue during the [[French Revolution of 1789]].&lt;ref&gt;Quartararo, A. (1995). Women Teachers and Popular Education in Nineteenth-Century France. Newark: University of Delaware Press {{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent politicians, such as [[Talleyrand]] and [[Condorcet]], each proposed a national system of education that would provide every citizen with basic [[primary education]]. With the intention of strengthening [[Politics of France|France's politics]] and armed forces, a growing concentration on [[higher education]] was later seen after the Revolution, notably from [[Napoleon I]] in his establishment of the [[University of France|Imperial University]] in 1804-8.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, H.C.. Education and the French Revolution (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969) {{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Catholic Church still remained highly involved within primary education. The [[Guizot]] Laws passed in 1833 obliged all communes to open boys’ schools.&lt;ref&gt;Gemie, S. (1995). Women and Schooling in France, 1815–1914. Staffordshire: Keele University Press {{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Falloux Laws]] of March 15, 1850 abolished teacher training programs for men which had been put in place by the Guizot Law. These laws created a mixed system in which some primary education establishments were public and controlled by the state and others were under the supervision of Catholic congregations.&lt;ref&gt;Gemie, S. (1995). Women and Schooling in France, 1815–1914. Staffordshire: Keele University Press {{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the concept of universal public schooling was important to these revolutionaries, it became clear that financial issues and political debate thwarted the implementation.

==Philosophy==
Despite the differences on economic, social, and other issues among the Republican radicals with whom [[Jules Ferry]] identified, they were united by the desire to obtain a secular republic&lt;ref&gt;Auspitz, Katherine. The Radical Bourgeoisie: The Ligue de l’enseignement and the Origins of the Third Republic 1866–1885 (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1982) {{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the growing popularity of [[anti-clericalism]] since the Revolution and notably during the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. In the wake of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and its new practices of employment and work days, the radicals also "hoped that schooling would make workers as reasonable and self-satisfied as it was credited with making the bourgeoisie."&lt;ref&gt;Auspitz, Katherine.

The 1698 attempt would not have held sway with the [[republicanism|Republican]] radicals of Ferry’s generation, who would have seen it as Catholic propaganda and as a defense against the growing popularity of [[Protestantism]]. Likewise, Napoleon’s Imperial University remained connected to the Church and paid little heed to primary education that would ensure basic literacy needs among the larger population. In Ferry’s view, schools would educate on political doctrine and the virtues of nationalism, emphasizing independent thought.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, H.C.. Education and the French Revolution (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969).{{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of Catholic orders were not allowed to teach in public schools after a five-year transitional period.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Gordon. France in Modern Times. New York: Norton, 1987 p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws of 1881==
On June 16, 1881, the first set of Jules Ferry Laws were passed, making primary education free for both boys and girls. To finance of the project, the communes and departments had the responsibility to subsidize it. Additionally, the laws protected the wages of teachers by mandating that "salaries... may never under any circumstances become inferior to the salaries they have enjoyed during the three years preceding the application of the present law..." (Art. 6).

==Laws of 1882==
===Article I===
''This article outlines what is to be included in a free, mandatory, and laic education system. The Act of March 15, 1850, referred to at the end of the article, is the [[Falloux Act]].''

Primary education includes:

The moral and civic education;

Reading and writing;

The language and elements of French literature;

Geography, particularly that of France;

History, particularly that of France to the present;

Basic lessons on law and political economy;

The elements of the natural sciences and mathematics, and their applications to agriculture, hygiene, industrial arts, handicrafts and use the tools of the principal occupations;

The elements of drawing, modeling and music;

Gymnastics;

For boys, military exercises;

For girls, needlework.

Article 23 of the Act of March 15, 1850 is repealed.

===Article 2===
''This article regulates the option of a religious education, which differs between public and private institutions.''

The public primary schools will hold one day free, apart from Sunday, allowing parents to give, if they wish, their children a religious education outside from school buildings. Religious education is optional in private schools.

===Article 3===
''This article discusses further annulment of portions of the [[Falloux Laws]] regarding religious authority.''

The measures of sections 18 and 44 of the Act of March 15, 1850 are repealed, in that they gave ministers of religion a right of inspection, supervision and management in public and private elementary schools and in the kindergartens (''salle d’asile''), as well as paragraph 2 of Article 31 of the Act, which gives consistories the right to present teacher candidates belonging to non-Catholic faiths.

===Article 4===
''This article makes compulsory primary education and lays down the requirements of age and manner of instruction (whether they will be schooled in the home or at a public or private institution).''

Primary education is compulsory for children of both sexes between the ages of six to thirteen years and may be given either in institutions of primary or secondary schools, in public or free schools, or in the home, by the father himself or anyone he chooses.

A regulation will determine the means of ensuring primary education for deaf, mute, and blind.

===Article 5===
''This article explains the formation of school boards, national representation in Paris and Lyon, and the terms of office of the members. A stratification of responsibility begins to take shape: first, parents were to have the primary responsibility over the education of their children. Mayors, then, as presidents of the local school boards, were to oversee that parents followed through with this responsibility. To oversee the school board, therefore, was the central government (see Article 7 below). This now removes church officials from these positions.''

A municipal school board is established in each commune to monitor and encourage school attendance. It consists of the mayor, president; a cantonal delegate and, in common with several townships, as many delegates as there are townships, designated by the school inspector; with members appointed by the department council in equal numbers, at most, to one third of the members of this council.
In Paris and Lyon, there is a school board for each municipal district. It is chaired, in Paris, by the mayor, in Lyon, by assistants; it is composed of one delegate appointed by the cantonal inspector of schools, with members appointed by the council, numbering three to seven by each district.
The term of office of members of the school board, appointed by the council under the second paragraph, lasts until the election of a new municipal council.
Their terms will always renewable.
The primary inspector is ex officio member of all school boards established within his jurisdiction.

===Article 6===
''This article discusses the graduation of students after they have completed the appropriate amount of primary education, determined by a public examination.''

There shall be established a certificate of primary studies; it is awarded after a public examination which may be presented to children beginning from the age of eleven. Those who, from that age, have obtained the certificate of primary studies, will be exempt from remaining compulsory school time.

===Article 7===
''This article discusses the compulsory requirements of the parents or guardians of each child in procuring an education, whether private or public.''

The father, guardian, person having custody of the child, the boss with whom the child is placed, shall, at least fifteen days before the time classes begin, advise the mayor of the town if the child is to be given education in the family or in a public or private school; in the latter two cases, he will indicate the chosen school.

The families living near to two or more public schools have the option to enroll their children in either of these schools, whether within or outside the territory of their commune, unless they already have the maximum number of students permitted by the regulations.

In case of dispute, and by request of either the mayor or the parents, the department council rules as the last resort.

===Article 8===
''This article discusses further requirements of the parents or guardians in maintaining their child’s attendance, regulated by the student records kept by the municipal school boards.''

Each year the mayor shall prepare, in consultation with the municipal school board, the list of all children aged between six and thirteen years and is to notify those persons who are responsible for these children at the time classes begin.

Failure to register, fifteen days before the beginning of school, on the part of parents and other responsible persons, allows him to automatically register the child in a public school and notify the person responsible.

Eight days before classes begin, he gives to the directors of public and private schools the list of children who will attend their schools.

A duplicate of these lists is sent by him to the primary inspector.

===Article 9===
''This article discusses the procedures for changing schools and/or the manner in which education is received.''

When a child leaves school, parents or persons responsible must immediately give notice to the mayor and indicate how the child will receive instruction in the future.

The school inspector invites those responsible for the child to comply with the law and makes them aware of the provisions of Article 12 below.

===Article 10===
''This article outlines policy regarding school absences.''

When a child misses school temporarily, parents or persons responsible should inform the director or the directress the reasons for this absence.

The directors and directresses must keep a register of attendance that notes, for each class, the absences of the students. At the end of each month, they will address to the mayor and the primary inspector a copy of the register, indicating the number of absences and reasons.

The reasons for absence will be submitted to the school board. The only known legitimate reasons are: child's illness, death of a family member, incapacity resulting from accidental difficulty of communications. The exceptional circumstances invoked will be taken into consideration by the school board.

===Article 11===
''This article discusses penalties against a school director in the failure to abide by the preceding article.''

Any private school director who will have not complied with the requirements of the preceding article shall, on the report of the school board and primary inspector, remand to the county council.

The county council may impose the following penalties: 1) warning; 2) censorship; 3) suspension for not more than one month and in case of recurrence in the school year, for not more than three months.

===Article 12===
''This article discusses the parent or guardian’s duty in the situation of excessive absences of their child.''

When a child is absent from school four times a month for at least half a day without justification accepted by the school board, the father, guardian or responsible person will be invited at least three days in advance to appear in the municipal hall, before the National Commission, which will remind him the text of the law and explain his duty.

In case of failure to appear without accepted justification, the school board will apply the penalty set out in the following article.

===Article 13===
''This article discusses repeated occurrences of the preceding offenses.''

In cases of recurrence within twelve months after the first offense, the municipal school board shall order the posting for fifteen days or a month, at the door of city hall, the surnames, first names, and qualifications of the person responsible, stating the offense made out against the person.

The same shall apply to persons who have not complied with the requirements of Article 9.

===Article 14===
''This article discusses, in further offense of excessive absence, legal proceedings to be administered.''

In case of further offense, the school board, or, in its stead, the inspector, should address a complaint to the justice of the peace.

The offense will be considered as a contravention resulting in penalties by the police in accordance with Articles 479, 480 and the following of the Penal Code.

Section 463 of the same code is applicable.

===Article 15===
''This article discusses the procedures for excusing a child’s absence, including the case of a child’s industrial or agricultural labor.''

The school board may grant to children living with their parents or guardians, when they make a reasoned request, exemptions from school attendance that may not exceed three months per year except holidays.

These exemptions should, if they exceed fifteen days, be subject to the approval of the primary inspector.

These provisions do not apply to children who accompany their parents or guardians when they absent themselves temporarily from the town.

In this case, a notice given verbally or in writing to the mayor or the teacher will suffice.

The school board may also, with the approval of the department council, exempt children employed in industry, once arrived at the age of apprenticeship, of one of the two classes of the day; the same opportunity will be given to all children employed, outside their families, in agriculture.

===Article 16===
''This article discusses the assessment of students instructed by their families through public examinations.''

Children who receive instruction in the family, must, each year, by the end of the second year of compulsory education, take an examination which will focus on matters of education for their age in public schools according to the following forms and programs that will be determined by ministerial orders made in the High Council.

The Examination Board shall consist of: the primary inspector or his delegate, president; a cantonal delegate; a person holding a university degree or a certificate of competency; the judges will be selected by the school inspector.

In examining the girls, the certificated person shall be a woman.

If examination of the child is considered inadequate and no excuse is accepted by the jury, parents are required to send their child to a public or private school within a week of notification or to inform the mayor what school they have chosen.

In failure of reporting, registration will take place automatically, as stated in Article 8.

===Article 17===
''This article addresses school funding provided by the laws passed on April 10, 1867 by [[Victor Duruy]].''

The school fund, established by Article 15 of the Act of April 10, 1867, will be established in all communes.

In communes where the subsidy does not exceed 30 francs, the fund will be entitled, on the appropriation for this purpose at the Ministry of Education, a grant at least equal to the amount of municipal subsidies.

The distribution of relief will be under the responsibility of the school board.

===Article 18===
''This article addresses the results of the failure of a school or schools within a commune to comply with Article 4; mandating compulsory primary education.''

Ministerial orders, made at the request of the school inspectors and department councils, will determine each year the commune where, as a result of inadequate school facilities, the requirements of Articles 4 and following the obligation could not be enforced.

An annual report, sent to the Congress by the Minister of Education, will give the list of communes to which this section has been applied.&lt;ref&gt;Donald N. Baker and Patrick J.

'''Larry Bensky''' (born May 1, 1937) is a [[literature|literary]] and [[politics|political]] [[journalism|journalist]] with more than forty years experience in both print and [[broadcasting|broadcast media]], as well as a teacher and long-time [[political activist]]. He is well known for his work with [[Pacifica Radio]] station [[KPFA]]-FM in [[Berkeley, California]], and for the many nationally broadcast hearings he anchored for the Pacifica network.

A native of [[New York City]], Bensky graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]] in 1954 and, with departmental honors, from [[Yale University]], where he was [[managing editor]] of the ''[[Yale Daily News]]''. He is married and has one daughter.

==Career as journalist==
Prior to his broadcasting career (and continuing throughout), Bensky worked as a print journalist and editor.  He worked at the ''Minneapolis Star-Tribune'' after college, while attending graduate school at the University of Minnesota.  He then worked as an editor at Random House, before moving to France, where he was  [[Paris]] editor of ''[[The Paris Review]]'' from 1964 to 1966.&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;[http://www.sundaysalon.org/larrybensky.asp "About Larry"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814082915/http://www.sundaysalon.org/larrybensky.asp |date=2007-08-14 }}, Sunday Salon website&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to New York, as an editor of ''The New York Times'' Sunday Book Review, and also wrote daily book reviews.  But his views on the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]] were not well received by editors of the ''Times,'' and several of his reviews and features were rejected. In 1968, he moved to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to take over as managing editor of the radical, anti-war publication, ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine,&lt;ref name=Planet&gt;Judith Scherr, [http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/article.cfm?archiveDate=05-04-07&amp;storyID=26982 "Larry Bensky, Activist-Journalist, Cancels KPFA Show",] ''[[Berkeley Daily Planet]]'', May 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; working closely with editor-in-chief [[Robert Scheer]].

After leaving ''Ramparts,'' Bensky worked for a time at [[San Francisco]] radio station [[KYLD|KSAN]]-FM, before joining the staff of KPFA-FM in Berkeley. In 1972, he anchored and produced Pacifica Radio's coverage of the [[1972 Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[1972 Republican National Convention|Republican national conventions]], both held in [[Miami]], along with the attendant massive [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-war protests]], dubbed "The Siege of Miami".&lt;ref name=Planet /&gt;

Bensky served  as station manager for KPFA from 1974-77. After returning to KSAN as a news anchor, reporter, and talk show host,  he narrowly missed accompanying Congressman [[Leo Ryan]] to investigate conditions at the [[Jonestown]] colony in [[Guyana]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=Planet /&gt; (Ryan and four journalists were shot to death on an airstrip, precipitating the mass murder-suicide of over 900 people.) In the early 1980s, Bensky turned his attention to the [[Central American Crisis|revolutions and American interventions]] in [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]].  He produced the PBS documentary, "Nicaragua: These Same Hands" in 1980.

===National affairs correspondent===
Perhaps best known as national affairs correspondent for [[Pacifica Radio]] from 1987-1998, Bensky covered numerous national and international events for Pacifica, including the [[Iran-Contra affair|Iran-Contra hearings]] in 1987, the confirmation hearings for four [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] justices, the 1990 elections in [[Nicaragua]], and numerous demonstrations and protests in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and elsewhere. Most recently, he anchored Pacifica's live coverage of the [[September 11 Commission]] hearings, and co-anchored Pacifica's coverage of the 2004 Democratic and Republican conventions, as well as the Presidential debates. He was anchor for Pacifica's extensive coverage of the post 2004 election controversy in Ohio, as well as several Congressional hearings about the misuse of executive power in the Bush administration.

He recently retired as host of a weekly two-hour radio talk show, [[Sunday Salon]], originating at [[KPFA]] in Berkeley. The broadcasts are archived at SundaySalon.org.[https://web.archive.org/web/20120717/http://www.kpfa.org/bensky/] Among his guests were numerous literary and political luminaries, including the late Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], [[Paul Krugman]], [[Manning Marable]], [[Bernie Sanders]], [[Jane Smiley]], [[Calvin Trillin]], and [[Gary Shteyngart]].

Bensky has written for ''[[The Nation]],'' magazine, and was a regular contributor to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Sunday Book Review. A longtime resident of Berkeley, he was a political writer and [[columnist]] for the ''[[East Bay Express]]'' for fifteen years.

He has also appeared as a guest journalist on [[C-SPAN]], [[CNN]], ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]],'' and ''[[The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour]]'', as well as on San Francisco [[KQED-FM]]'s "Forum" and [[KQED-TV]]'s "This Week in Northern California." In addition, he was founding managing editor (1999-2000) of the web site Mediachannel.org.[http://www.mediachannel.org/]

Bensky won the prestigious [[George Polk award]] for his coverage of [[Iran-Contra]], and has won five Gold Reel awards from the [[National Federation of Community Broadcasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.brooklyn.liu.edu/polk/prev/prev80.html#87 | title = The George Polk Awards for Journalism | accessdate=August 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has won a career achievement award from the [[Society of Professional Journalists]], and the Golden Gadfly award from [[Media Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spj.org/norcal/eijwinners.html#B |title=Society of Professional Journalists Northern California Chapter |accessdate=August 21, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614164833/http://www.spj.org/norcal/eijwinners.html |archivedate=June 14, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educator and activist ==
In addition to his work as a journalist, Bensky has had a continuing role in the classroom.  For twelve years he taught [[broadcast journalism]] classes at [[Stanford]] and courses in [[mass communication]], journalism, broadcasting, and [[political science]] at [[California State University, East Bay|California State University (CSU), East Bay]] in [[Hayward, California]]. He currently teaches [[Media studies|media criticism and analysis]] at [[Berkeley City College]] and political science at CSU, East Bay.

Bensky has been a political activist since the 1960s, working with [[nuclear disarmament]] and [[anti-war]] groups in [[New York City]], [[Paris]], and [[San Francisco]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1968, he signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''&lt;/ref&gt; He co-designed and wrote numerous successful [[direct mail]] appeals for Modern [[progressivism in the United States#Contemporary progressivism|progressive]] organizations, including [[Greenpeace]], the [[Sierra Club]], and the [[United Farm Workers]]. He is a devout [[pacifism|pacifist]] and an outspoken opponent of [[capital punishment]].

==Current activities==
Since retiring from regular broadcasting in 2007, Bensky has returned to a lifetime [[avocation]], French language and literature.  He is producer and host
of "[http://www.Bard.edu/radioproust Radio Proust]," a web site which he's developing as a fellow of the Bard College Center.  He has also developed and is teaching classes about [[Marcel Proust|Proust]] for the [[Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes|Osher Lifelong Learning Institute]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

From 1881 to 1888 he served as an assistant to his brother, Professor Rolla C. Carpenter, in teaching courses at the [[Michigan State Agricultural College]].&lt;ref&gt;Annual Report of the [[Michigan State Agricultural College]] dated June 30, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883 he was awarded his Masters of Science degree from [[Michigan State Agricultural College]].&lt;ref name=Lamb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Twentieth/&gt;&lt;ref name=New/&gt;

==Career==
Carpenter began teaching mathematics at [[Michigan State Agricultural College]] and did so from 1883 to 1888.&lt;ref name=Twentieth/&gt;&lt;ref name=Herringshaw&gt;{{cite web| title=Carpenter, Louis George, Mathematician| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xxg7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR17&amp;lpg=PR17&amp;dq=louis+george+carpenter+1861&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_jNhex791I&amp;sig=3FhReI-GCAdVYEc-i_ZdUN-QqsY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D86MVaCgNYqWNtHZgVA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=louis%20george%20carpenter%201861&amp;f=false| publisher=Herringshaw's Encyclopedia of American Biography of the Nineteenth Century: Accurate and Succinct Biographies of Famous Men and Women in All Walks of Life who are Or Have Been the Acknowledged Leaders of Life and Thought of the United States Since Its Formation ... by Thomas William Herringshaw - published by the American Publishers' Association |date=1904| accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpenter was recruited by [[Colorado State University#President Charles Ingersoll|President Charles Ingersoll]] and accepted the chair of the Engineering &amp; Physics Department of the then Colorado Agricultural College.&lt;ref name=Lamb/&gt; It was there where he began the first organized and systematic college program for irrigation engineering. Those completing such instruction were awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Irrigation Engineering. In addition, Carpenter was a strong advocate to expand education opportunities to minorities and women. He helped promote and organize newly accredited degree programs despite opposition from those unwilling to change.&lt;ref name=World-wide/&gt;&lt;ref name=New/&gt;&lt;ref name=Papers&gt;{{cite web| title=Papers of Louis G. Carpenter, 1892-1910 - Carpenter, L. G.

Carpenter declined the Presidency of that college (later university) in 1891 and several times during his tenure.&lt;ref name=World-wide/&gt; Despite difficultly to enact change, he was significant in being able to help transform the farm focused college into a university of higher learning.&lt;ref name=Lamb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Twentieth/&gt;

In 1889 he became the director of the Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station.&lt;ref name=Twentieth/&gt;&lt;ref name=World-wide/&gt;&lt;ref name=New/&gt;

Carpenter was one of the foremost leading experts on irrigation systems. During his life he investigated irrigation systems not only in North America but also in Canada and Europe. This led to his engineering consulting and water law. He became Colorado's State Engineer which he held for several years while still teaching.&lt;ref name=Papers/&gt;

In 1911, Carpenter left academics and established an engineering consulting firm in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. This covered not only included Irrigation Engineering but consulting on hydraulic construction projects and the problems associated with such projects.&lt;ref name=Papers/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lange/&gt; He did this traveling around Canada, the United States and Western Europe with his brother running the office until his retirement in 1922. He left many papers to the University and was given an honorary doctorate before his death in 1935.&lt;ref name=Papers/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lange/&gt;

==Further work==
In 1907, Carpenter concluded a report for the [[British Columbia]] Irrigation commission to assist them in implementing in engineering the irrigation of southern BC. This led to the eventual development of the BC Ministry of Agriculture eight present watershed and demand areas.&lt;ref name=BCLIB&gt;{{cite web| title=Report of the Commission to Inquire into the Irrigation of Land in the Province of British Columbia - for the British Columbia Irrigation Commission 1907| author= Carpenter, Louis G.

Reportedly, he reviewed and edited geological reports from several countries.&lt;ref name=Twentieth/&gt;

==Books==
One example of a book written by Carpenter has the title, "On the measurement and division of water" published by the Colorado Agricultural College - Agricultural Experiment Station in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]].

== Early life ==

Maruxa was born in Madrid in 1930. His father's name was Antonino Pita and her 3 sisters: Carmen, Chita and Isabel. At the age of 17 she followed her older sister Chita and joined the Teresian Association that was founded by Father [[Pedro Poveda Castroverde|Pedro Poveda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.philstar.com/fashion-and-beauty/2013/04/17/931369/povedans-honor-maruxa-pita-lady-big-heart | title = Povedans honor Maruxa Pita, a lady with a big heart | newspaper = PhilStar.com | date = April 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Philippines ==

She arrived in the Philippines in 1959 to help established the ''Institucion Teresiana School'' now known as [[Saint Pedro Poveda College]] in Quezon City. She served as a school principal from 1965 to 1973. She then taught Spanish at both the [[University of Santo Tomas]] from 1973 to 1979 and the Spanish Cultural Center from 1975 to 1979. She also worked as the director of the Spanish Cultural Center where she organized all the teaching areas and managed the Spanish teachers from 1979 to 1993. In 1993, the Instituto Cervantes of Manila was established and she stayed as the academic head of the center. It was the first Cervantes established in Asia. The 
Instituto Cervantes gave a tribute to the tireless and outstanding teacher honoring her work in [[Spanish language in the Philippines]] and her dedication and commitment to help educate underprivileged children with her foundation.&lt;ref name="Thank you, Señora Maruxa"/&gt;

=== Trivia ===

At that time, Institucion Teresianas pre-school was coed. Maruxa recalls that she taught the four older children of the late former Sen. [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] and former President [[Corazon Aquino]], who included current President [[Benigno Aquino III]]. She says that "They were all together in school".&lt;ref name="Maruxa Pita: Angel Maruxa"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.philstar.com/feature/777799/maruxa-pita-angel-maruxa | title = Maruxa Pita: Angel Maruxa | newspaper = PhilStar.com | date = February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genesis ==
The National Academy of Medical Sciences originated as the Indian Academy of Medical Sciences, a registered society, on 21 April 1961, for the promotion of medical education and research in India.&lt;ref name="About NAMS" /&gt; The academy, housed in NAMS House, New Delhi, started functioning when [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the then Prime Minister of India inaugurated the institution on 19 December 1961. In 1963, the inaugural convocation was held at [[Vigyan Bhavan]], New Delhi when [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] addressed the gathering. The Academy re-branded itself as the National Academy of Medical Sciences (India) on 16 November 1976.

== Governance ==
The governance of the Academy is by a council composed of 22 members, selected from the Indian medical community, and is headed by a President and a Vice President, with a Treasurer assisting them in financial matters.&lt;ref name="About NAMS" /&gt; Mukund S. Joshi is the incumbent president and Sanjay Wadhwa and Manorama Berry serves as the vice president and treasurer, respectively.&lt;ref name="Office Bearers"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nams-india.in/about.php?n=officebearers | title=Office Bearers | publisher=NAMS | date=2016 | accessdate=March 19, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002326/http://www.nams-india.in/about.php?n=officebearers | archive-date=20 March 2016 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The council members include many notable medical personalities such as [[P. K. Dave]], [[Saroj Chooramani Gopal]] and [[Mohan Kameswaran]], among others.&lt;ref name="List Of Council Members"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nams-india.in/about.php?n=councilmembers | title=List Of Council Members | publisher=NAMS | date=2016 | accessdate=March 19, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002235/http://www.nams-india.in/about.php?n=councilmembers | archive-date=20 March 2016 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
One of the principal activities of NAMS is promoting medical education through [[continuing medical education]] (CME) programmes for the junior scientists and medical professionals.&lt;ref name="From Physiology and Chemistry to Biochemistry" /&gt; The Academy provides opportunities, on a regular basis, for the aspirants to undergo training at various centres of excellence. It conducts symposia and workshops on various medical topics where medical professionals and researchers are exposed to modern medical methodologies and practices and encourages them to join the stream as members of the Academy.&lt;ref name="About NAMS" /&gt; On successful performance at the entry examination conducted by the [[National Board of Examinations]], the examinees are awarded the [[Diplomate of National Board]] title (formerly MNAMS).&lt;ref name="Notification"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.natboard.edu.in/dnb_matter.php?notice_id=4 | title=Notification | publisher=National Board of Examinations | date=2016 | accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the academic promotion activities, the Academy recognizes excellence through Fellowships and Awards; the fellowship further categorized into Honorary Fellows and elected Fellows. Honorary Fellowship is awarded to eminent personalities while elected fellowship is limited to medical professionals. An annual conference is conducted by the Academy, NAMSCON, which is a major event in the Indian medical calendar.&lt;ref name="Namscon2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://namscon2014.com/pages/about-us.php | title=Namscon2014 | publisher=Namscon | date=2016 | accessdate=March 19, 2016 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320064104/http://namscon2014.com/pages/about-us.php | archivedate=March 20, 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, it acts as an advisory body to the Government of India in matters related to National Health Policy and Planning.&lt;ref name="About NAMS" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5968">The '''National Training System''' is the [[Australia]]n system for [[vocational education]] and training (VET) under the '''Australian Quality Training Framework''' (AQTF), in which [[employer]]s, the [[States of Australia]], and the [[Government of australia|Commonwealth Government]], formalise a curriculum available for Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) to teach and assess the competency of students.

The Australian Quality Training Framework (AQTF) sets the standards for the operation of training organisations registered to deliver training services and to issue VET qualifications. Training products  include national [[Training Package|training packages]] and accredited courses which outline the qualifications, competencies and assessment criteria for specific areas of training. These two dimensions form the National Skills Framework. The National Quality Council is responsible for overseeing the effective operation of the Framework. Training received and certified under the framework is 'portable' across state boundaries and industries.

All students doing nationally recognised training need to have a Unique Student Identifier (USI).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usi.gov.au/about&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training organisations==
Australia has a system of [[Technical and Further Education]] colleges, which offers courses in most larger towns and cities at technical schools and [[community college]]s.

Additionally, individuals and companies can be accredited as a Registered Training Organisation and offer courses and modules of training.

==Hierarchy==
The courses available are listed by the [http://www.training.gov.au]. The hierarchy of courses available for VET under the [[Australian Qualifications Framework#Vocational Education and Training and Higher Education sectors|Australian Qualifications Framework]] is:
* [[Advanced Diploma]]
* [[Diploma]]
* [[Australian Qualifications Framework|Certificate]] (ranked 1-4, with 4 being the highest)

The training packages at the Cert II-IV levels offer options as well as the mandatory courses. A person founding out their training would be able to group these extra training courses and be assessed for additional or higher certificates.

Hence: 
* Certificate 1 is a basic qualification, necessarily linked to other simple vocational competencies. Example:,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.training.gov.au], accessed 2009-05-09&lt;/ref&gt; Cert I in Furnishing
* Certificate 2 is a trade-specific competency, that would be linked to other competencies to become a trade qualification. Example:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntis.gov.au/Default.aspx?/trainingpackage/LMF02/qualification/LMF20202/rules LMF20202: Certificate II in Furniture Finishing], training.gov.au, accessed 2009-05-09&lt;/ref&gt; Cert II in Furniture Finishing
* Certificate 3 is a trade qualification, wherein several competencies are brought together as a demonstrated trade. Example:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntis.gov.au/Default.aspx?/trainingpackage/LMF02/qualification/LMF30402/rules LMF30402: Certificate III in Furniture Making (Cabinet Making)], National Training Information Service, accessed 2009-05-09&lt;/ref&gt; Cert III in Furniture Making (Cabinet Making)
* Certificate 4 demonstrates the person's qualification in a field of vocational education and training. Example:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntis.gov.au/Default.aspx?/trainingpackage/LMF02/qualification/LMF40202/rules LMF40202: Certificate IV in Furnishing Technology], National Training Information Service, accessed 2009-05-09&lt;/ref&gt; Cert IV in Furnishing Technology (that brings together a group of skills and workplace leadership competencies.)

==Recognition of prior learning==
A person's experience can also be assessed without formal training under a system of "[[recognition of prior learning]]" (RPL). In such cases, the assessor (who would be qualified as a [https://training.gov.au/training/details/tae40110 Certificate IV in Training and Assessment - TAE40110] from Training Package TAE10) can take evidence of the person's abilities, experience, and training the particular skill area, plus similar and other fields, and issue a certificate; or, require the person to undertake certain courses to round out the person's competencies before the issue of a certificate.

==History==
The RPL for history in Australia dates back to 1993 when it was first introduced by the Australian Government as part of a National Qualifications Framework.

RPL has been the mainstay of all assessments conducted under national vocational education and training systems since the late 1980s and continues to evolve as different VET systems evolve. It was first introduced into the UK by Susan Simosko, a consultant with the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, who adapted it as the central element of all competency-based assessments. A similar process was adopted by all countries during the development of their own vocational education and training systems, some aligned solely with the need to assess competence in line with the needs of private and public sector organizations, and others as a critical element of the assessment of skills and knowledge in order to grant vocational qualifications.

As of 2015, it is part of the Australian Quality Training Framework (AQTF) charter and the standards for Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) delivering accredited training. There are numerous companies that offer training online that help Australians get qualified and improve their careers. There is no RPL model that is suitable for all qualifications throughout Australia.

To be awarded a diploma, pupils must acquire the seven key competences of the "Common Core of Knowledge and Skills"&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.eduscol.education.fr/file/dossiers/50/3/enseignement_scolaire_VA_135503.pdf School Education in France], p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and score a minimum of 190 points (out of 380).&lt;ref&gt;[http://winbee.webs.com/onlinebrevet.htm Subjects to study for the Brevet Degree]&lt;/ref&gt; These points are awarded via tests in each subject except in history-geography-civics (continuous assessment: ''contrôle continu'') and in a final exam at the end of 3&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;. Also starting from 2008, pupils must acquire the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages|A2]] level of the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] in a foreign language (English, German, Spanish, Italian...).  In other countries, primarily the UK, [[United States]], [[Canada]], and several ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] and [[Asia]]n countries, the equivalent period covered by the diploma is [[middle school]].

==Continuous assessment==
Over the course of the ninth grade, at the end of each unit of a course, all pupils take a test graded out of twenty points.{{clarify|they skip 19? Random choice? for 20 points?|date=December 2011}} At the end of each trimester the average mark from each subject is calculated as well as a general average (the average of all the subjects' averages).&lt;ref&gt;[http://internationallessingschool.com ILS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until 2007 the averages from the two school years (six trimesters) from the start of the ''quatrième'' (eighth grade) to the end of the ninth grade were counted towards the final result. From 2007 onwards, only the marks from the ninth grade are used.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/2006/26/MENE0601428A.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A pupil may know he has a good enough average to pass the Brevet before sitting for the exams. However students may not skip the exams, as that would mean automatic disqualification.

==Final exam==
At the end of the ninth grade, three tests are taken, such that each will have a score of:&lt;br&gt;
French: 100&lt;br&gt;
History, geography and citizenship: 50&lt;br&gt;
Mathematics: 100&lt;br&gt;
Biology, Physics, Chemistry and Technology: 50

And as of 2011, an oral exam in cultural history&lt;ref&gt;histoire des arts&lt;/ref&gt; is mandatory for all students in the ninth grade. It is taken before the three other tests. It consists of writing an essay (around 2000 words) about any art form and analyzing 6 to 8 paintings, then presenting them to two teachers for 10–15 minutes then answering questions that they ask. This also has a score out of 40.

==Calculation==
The results are calculated using a weighted total. The subjects of the final exams are weighted as follows:&lt;ref&gt;http://eduscol.education.fr/D0071/accueil.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

*French: 2
*Mathematics: 2
*History, Geography and Civic Education: 2

The subjects studied in the ninth grade&lt;ref&gt;contrôle continu&lt;/ref&gt; are given a total weighting of 9 to 11, depending on the série taken.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/2005/31/MENE0501646A.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In order to pass the Brevet, the pupil must score on average the equivalent of 10 out of 20. A higher score may result in the award of a "mention":&lt;ref&gt;http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/2005/31/MENE0501622D.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* 16–20: ''Mention très bien'': TB (with highest honors)
* 14–15.9: ''bien'': B (high honors)
* 12–13.9: ''assez bien'': AB (honors)

'''Norbert Vesak''' (October 22, 1936 – October 2, 1990), one of Canada's leading choreographers in the 1970s, was a [[ballet]] [[dancer]], [[choreographer]], [[theatrical director]], master teacher, dance columnist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sunter|first=Robert|title=Vesak Seeks Craft First|newspaper=Vancouver Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; lecturer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Second Gold Medal For Choreographer|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=July 24, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opera ballet director, known for his unique, flamboyant style&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyman|first=Max|title=The Happiness Dancers: Vancouver's New Modern Troupe Is Previewed|newspaper=The Vancouver Sun|date=December 22, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and his multimedia approach to classical and contemporary choreography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pepper|first=Kaija|title=Renegade Bodies: Canadian Dance in the 1970s|year=2012|publisher=Dance Collection Danse Press, 2012|isbn=0929003705}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Jack|title=Norbert Vesak, 53, Former Chief of the Met Opera Ballet, Is Dead|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 3, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with helping to bring modern dance to Western Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Don|title=World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theater: The Americas|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415227452|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyman|first=Max|title=Western Dance Theatre leaps into reality|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|date=May 26, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacGillivray|first=Alex|title=Leisure|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|date=May 27, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Although Vesak worked internationally as a choreographer, he was frequently referred to as "Canada's finest male dancer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hunter|first=Don|title=A new company is born|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|date=January 9, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early in his career, he often choreographed works and then danced in them as well, receiving critical acclaim for both roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hunter|first=Don|title=Vesak preview exciting event|newspaper=Province Paper|date=December 22, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was described as a "Renaissance Man", well known as a lecturer, dancer, set and costume designer, and teacher, as well as for his choreography and work in the theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacDermid|first=Cassandre|title=Norbert Vesak Wins Friends For Contemporary Dance|newspaper=Trail Daily Times|date=March 26, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vesak was born in [[Port Moody]], [[British Columbia]] in 1936 to Frank and Nora Vesak, of Czech and Belgian descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lingg|first=Ann|title=The House|newspaper=The Metropolitan Mirror|date=January 1, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he was an opera fan who described listening to Metropolitan Opera broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Francis|title=The Metropolitan Opera|year=1957|publisher=Doubleday and Company|location=New York|isbn=0-385-12975-0|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied dance in Edmonton, Alberta with Laine Metz and followed that with study under Josephine Slater, whom he described as having the greatest influence on his career at that time, because in addition to teaching and mentoring him, she introduced him to [[Ted Shawn]] who was one of the pioneers of modern dance in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyman|first=Max|title=Canada's Happiness Dancers|newspaper=Dance Canada Danse Norbert Vesak Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vesak was given a scholarship to train with Shawn at [[Jacob's Pillow]] in Lee, Massachusetts, where he trained and eventually joined the teaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dance Collection Danse Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vesak also studied under [[Margaret Craske]], [[Merce Cunningham]], [[Geoffrey Holder]], [[Pauline Koner]], Madam La Meri, Robert Abramson, [[Ruth St. Denis]], and [[Vera Volkova]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Jack|title=Norbert Vesak, 53, Former Chief of the Met Opera Ballet, Is Dead|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 5, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was classically trained, and was a member of the Royal Academy of Dancing and Ballet in Britain and also studied ethnic dance extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hunter|first=Don|title=Dance: A new company is born|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|date=January 9, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he wanted to be an actor, at the age of 17, he decided on dance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacDermid|first=Cassandre|title=Norbert Vesak Wins Friends For Contemporary Dance|newspaper=Trail Daily Times|date=March 26, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was awarded a scholarship in 1960 to [[Jacob's Pillow Dance]] in Massachusetts, where he studied under the direction of [[Ted Shawn]] and other well-known teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hunter|first=DON|title=A new company is born|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|date=January 9, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Vesak returned to Vancouver, he co-founded the '''Pacific Dance Theatre''' in 1964 and later founded the eponymous Norbert Vesak Dancers, which became the '''Western Dance Theatre''' in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists Biography: Norbert Vesak|url=http://www.artsalive.ca/en/dan/meet/bios/artistDetail.asp?artistID=76|work=ArtsAlive.ca|publisher=Dance National Arts Center|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Norbert Vesak was named resident choreographer for the Vancouver Playhouse Theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cameron Academy|url=http://www.cameronacademy.ca/about/|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He went to England to perform with Western Theatre Ballet, and then returned to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Artists: Norbert Vesak|url=http://www.artsalive.ca/en/dan/meet/bios/artistDetail.asp?artistID=76|work=ArtsAlive.co|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, he served as the resident choreographer for the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, Theatre Calgary and the Banff Festival Ballet, and several other companies, doing choreography, teaching, and directorial work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Artists: Norbert Vesak|url=http://www.artsalive.ca/en/dan/meet/bios/artistDetail.asp?artistID=76|publisher=ArtsAlive.ca|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time he founded the Western Dance Theatre, he had already created 60 major works and had been a guest choreographer at several companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hunter|first=Don|title=A new company is born|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|date=January 9, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work with the Western Dance Theater was, by his description, designed to present stories about human relations, with influences from the monumental geography of British Columbia: "We would hope the rugged beauty of the environment of B.C. was evident in Western Dance Theatre's work, and that it is truly a product of a unique area of Canadian topography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyman|first=Max|title=City enriched by two dance companies|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|date=November 7, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vesak often undertook large, complex projects that attracted critical admiration for their scope, as for example, in June, 1969, when he choreographed  Pierrot Lunaire by Austrian composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]], danced to the central part of Schoenberg's 21-part orchestration of poems by Belgian poet [[Albert Giraud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyman|first=Max|title=Virtuosity Amidst Quantity|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|date=June 25, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;   One of Vesak's major objectives was educating the public about contemporary dance, and his companies often presented free educational programs on contemporary dance in public schools and other public venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vesak's Great Promise: A big dance step|newspaper=Vancouver Express|date=April 30, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyman|first=Max|title=Letting the Kids Tell It All|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|date=November 29, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His dance school in Vancouver at one time had an enrollment of more than 700 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacDermid|first=Cassandre|title=Norbert Vesak Wins Friends for Contemporary Dance|newspaper=Trail Daily Times|date=Marcy 26, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1961 to 1962, he published what has been called the "shortest-lived dance magazine in Canadian history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowring|first=Amy|title=Marking Time|journal=The Dance Current|date=May 2008|volume=11|issue=1|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Called "The Canadian Dance World Magazine", Vesak and Slater published a total of six issues of the free 16-page magazine and distributed it to 300 individuals who were interested in dance.  Each issue had its own theme including: men in dance, ethnic dance, religion in dance, symbolism, and leaders of the modern dance movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowring|first=Amy|title=Marking Time|journal=The Dance Current|date=May 2008|volume=11|issue=1|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the magazine as being "dedicated to the furtherance of dance" in Canada and he published it without attribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vesak|first=Norbert|title=Dear Reader|journal=The Canadian Dance World Magazine|year=1961|volume=1|series=Dance Canada Danse Archives|issue=1|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known for choreographing both classical and contemporary work, in 1963, Vesak debuted his choreographic work entitled '''Parenthesis''', at the first Canadian Modern Dance Festival in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Jack|title=Norbert Vesak, 53, Former Chief of the Met Opera Ballet, Is Dead|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 5, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also created works, such as ''From Ecstasy to Despair'' in 1969, that were described as futuristic and emotionally jarring, that provided an important social message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McLeod|first=Brian|title=Vesak dancers mirror social schizophrenia|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|date=September 17, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was director of the [[San Francisco Opera]] ballet from 1970 to 1975. He was named official choreographer for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dafoe|first=Christopher|title=Dancing Through Time|year=1990|publisher=Portage and Main|isbn=978-0969426417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1975, he was named director of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson,|first=Jack|title=Norbert Vesak, 53, Former Chief of the Met Opera Ballet, Is Dead|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 5, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He became one of the most internationally renowned choreographers of his time, having the rare distinction of being awarded two international gold medals for choreography in a single year, withhis broad range of work performed throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Into a Fantasy World: A History of Ballet|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/ballet/|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Company|date=September 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two notable ballets Vesak created in the 1970s, [[The Ecstasy of Rita Joe]] and ''What To Do 'Till the Messiah Comes'', were major successes for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and highlighted important cultural and sociological issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Terry|first=Walter|title=The Met: A New Ballet Look|journal=Dance Magazine|date=February 5, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Ecstasy of Rita Joe'', was commissioned by the Manitoba Indian Brotherhood and debuted as a ballet in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doob|first=Penelope|title=Canadian Encyclopedia: Encyclopedia of Music in Canada|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/norbert-vesak|publisher=Historica Dominion|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ballet was based on a controversial play written by George Ryga about a young Aboriginal girl who leaves the reservation to move to the big city, and about the cultural conflicts, poverty, and violence that she experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="The Ecstasy of Rita Joe": Royal Canadian Ballet revisits Groundbreaking Work|url=http://www.cbc.ca/manitoba/scene/other/2011/05/04/the-ecstasy-of-rita-joe/|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Company|date=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vesak's ballet was said to surpass the play itself in terms of delivering the intended message to the audience: "Most of the reviews were vehement in their support of the ballet's antiracist message. William Littler in the Toronto Daily Star called it 'perhaps the ballet of 1971, in terms of its social importance to Canadians'. He noted that the ballet is 'less angry, less polemical in tone than Ryga's play, which hammers away at the idea that white justice cannot comprehend the Indian fact.' In 'the abstracting medium of dance,' wrote Littler, the message 'loses some of its soap-box shrillness and gains symbolic power.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pepper|first=Kaija|title=Renegade Bodies - Canadian Dance in the 1970s|year=2012|publisher=Dance Collection Danse Press|isbn=9780929003702|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commissioning of this work by the Manitoba Indian Brotherhood was said to have been a calculated effort by the Brotherhood to bring the message about the effects of racism against indigenous peoples to a larger population through use of a medium, ballet, that was not usually used for inspiring societal understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pepper|first=Kaija|title=Renegade Bodies: Canadian Dance in the 1970s|year=2012|publisher=Dance Collection Danse Press|isbn=978-0929003702}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As a platform for Aboriginal rights, The Ecstasy of Rita Joe was undeniably potent, with people sobbing at the end of the ballet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pepper|first=Kaija|title=Renegade Bodies|year=2012|publisher=Dance Canada Danse|location=Toronto|isbn=0929003705|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ballet met with equal success when it was performed internationally: “Themes explored in Norbert Vesak’s the ''Ecstasy of Rita Joe'' met with resounding acceptance throughout Australia on the spring tour of 1972. Anna Maria de Gorriz, in the title role, brought down the house with curtain calls in Sidney and Melbourne.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dafoe|first=Christopher|title=Dancing Through Time|year=1990|publisher=Portage and Main|isbn=978-0969426417|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, ''What to do Till the Messiah Comes'' became another of Vesak's most acclaimed works, described as a visionary ballet set to rock music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Craine|first=Debra|title=Oxford Dictionary of Dance|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199563449|page=471}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1980, he won gold medals for his choreography of ''Belong Pas de Deux'' from that work at the International Ballet Concours in both Varna, Bulgaria and Osaka, Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Second Gold Medal for Choreographer|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=Junly 24, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Canadian ballerina [[Evelyn Hart]] won a gold medal in Varna, Bulgaria for her performance of ''Belong'' with [[David Peregrine]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Second Gold Medal for Choreographer|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=July 24, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hart rose to international stardom, and Vesak's "Belong" became a signature piece for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Triumphant, in Winnipeg|newspaper=Dance Canada Danse Norbert Vesak Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Belong Pas de Deux'' remains one of Vesak's most enduring works, and is in the repertoires of ballet companies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contemporary Dance Videos|url=http://contemporarydancevideos.com/belong-pas-de-deux/|work=Belong Pas de Deux|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Performances of it were televised in several countries including Canada, the United States, Scotland, England, Germany, and Israel, and it became the title subject of an IMAX film entitled ''Heart Land'', which was released in 1987 and distributed internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMAX Is Believing|url=http://www.imax.com/movies/m/heart-land/|accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neufeld|first=James|title=Passion to Dance: National Ballet of Canada|year=2011|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1459701212|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Albertson|first=Kristi|title=Fresh Legs|url=http://www.dailyinterlake.com/community/lifestyle/article_e78d7d6e-7b6f-5d41-af8e-19e5d98cfe72.html?mode=jqm|newspaper=The Daily Inner Lake|date=March 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Norbert Vesak collaborated with director Franco Zeffirelli, choreographing La Traviata for the Metropolitan Opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Review/Opera; More Zeffirelli on the Grand Scale In the Met's New 'Traviata'|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 18, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his choreography work, Norbert Vesak was highly sought after for his skill as a Master Teacher, particularly regarded for the individual attention he gave to dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Jack|title=Norbert Vesak, 53, Former Chief of the Met Opera Ballet, Is Dead|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 5, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He often co-taught master classes with [[Joffrey Ballet]] founder [[Robert Joffrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lingg|first=Ann|title=The House|newspaper=The Metropolitan Mirror|date=January 1, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vesak's commitment to mentoring and providing dance opportunities to young dancers, as well as raising interest in dance, was clear throughout his life.

Vesak was regularly chosen to create new works for international companies, receiving commissions from such institutions as the Metropolitan Opera, the Berlin Ballet, the North Carolina Dance Theatre, the Los Angeles Ballet, the Miami Ballet, the Scottish Ballet,  the Joffrey II Dancers, Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich, the National Ballet of Canada, the Winnipeg Contemporary Dancers, The Alberta Ballet, Ballet Florida in Palm Beach, National Association for Regional Ballet, the Marin Ballet in San Rafael, California, and the Deutsche Opera Ballet in Berlin, in addition to many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Jack|title=Norbert Vesak, 53, Former Chief Of the Met Opera Ballet, Is Dead|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 5, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lady of the Camellias''' was conceived by Norbert Vesak and Robert de La Rose to be a full-length ballet based on the novel of the same name by  Alexander Dumas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Montee|first=Kristy|title=This Ballet Premiere is Saga in Itself|newspaper=Sun Sentinel|date=February 20, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Vesak worked on the concept, the libretto, selected the music, and even had the costumes designed by de La Rose, ''Lady of the Camellias'' was ultimately choreographed by another international choreographer, [[Val Caniparoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Montee|first=Kristy|title=This Ballet Premiere is Saga in Itself|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-02-20/entertainment/9402160688_1_san-francisco-ballet-norbert-vesak-val-caniparoli|newspaper=Sun Sentinel|date=February 20, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vesak died suddenly of a [[brain aneurysm]] while on his way to attend the 20th anniversary celebration of North Carolina Dance Theater, where a work that he had designed for that company in 1975, ''The Gray Goose of Silence'', was being performed to commemorate the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Jack|title=Norbert Vesak, 53, Former Chief Of the Met Opera Ballet, Is Dead|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 5, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;   After his death, ''Lady of the Camellias'' remained in limbo for three years until de La Rose approached Caniparoli about taking it on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keane|first=Erin|title=Doomed Love Affair Opens Ballet Season|url=http://wfpl.org/post/doomed-love-affair-opens-ballet-season|newspaper=WFPL News|date=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caniparoli had known Vesak well, since Vesak had given Caniparoli his first professional job and was also one of Caniparoli's teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Bradley|title=Bringing New Life to An Old Story|url=http://www.urbantulsa.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A56446|newspaper=Urban Tulsa Weekly|date=January 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caniparoli agreed to do the project, adapting Vesak's concept and music to his own choreography, with de La Rose providing the costume and partial set design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Montee|first=Kristy|title=This Ballet Premiere Is Saga In Itself|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-02-20/entertainment/9402160688_1_san-francisco-ballet-norbert-vesak-val-caniparoli|newspaper=Sun Sentinel|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was Caniparoli's first full-length work, and debuted by Ballet Florida in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Montee|first=Kristy|title=This Ballet: Premiere Is a Saga in Itself|newspaper=Sun Sentinel|date=February 20, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It has since been performed by many companies including: Ballet West, Ballet Florida, Boston Ballet, Cincinnati Ballet, Tulsa Ballet, Alberta Ballet, Diablo Ballet, and Royal Winnipeg Ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keane|first=Erin|title=Doomed Love Affair Opens Ballet Season|url=http://wfpl.org/post/doomed-love-affair-opens-ballet-season|publisher=WFPL News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tulsa Ballet Stages Lady of the Camellias this February|work=January 17, 2013|publisher=Tulsa Ballet News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''peer tutor''' is anyone who is of a similar status as the person being [[tutor]]ed. In an [[undergraduate]] institution this would usually be other undergraduates, as distinct from the graduate students who may be teaching the writing classes; in an [[K-12]] school this is usually a student from the same grade or higher. There are some basic rules to establishing your peer tutoring program, the key to success is a clear objective. Thorough planning and [http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse;ID=ry0lxcvs63c8z#3 evidence gathering activities] will contribute to substantiation of the decisions you will make.



==About==

There are many benefits for both the peer tutor and tutee in this relationship, one aspect of this is that the tutor can establish a rapport with the tutee in a way that a teacher cannot. A peer tutor may have taken the same class recently, or have taken similar classes. 

Because the peer tutor is seen by the tutee as being more at their own level, advice given by the tutor may be accepted more readily than advice from a teacher. Another key reason for this is that a peer tutor does not give any grade on the paper, whereas a teacher serving in a tutor role may still be perceived as someone who grades papers.

Peer tutors can be trained through on-the-job training, as well as through formal [[workshop]]s. New tutors can be paired with more experienced tutors for their first few tutorials, and after the tutors are satisfied that the new tutors can operate alone they can give one-on-one tutoring. A key aspect of tutor training is the reflection on tutorials with other tutors. This reflection looks at what could have gone better as well as the tutor's progress in giving tutorials.

In higher education tutorial settings, the benefits of peer tutoring programs also extend to class tutors.&lt;ref&gt;Outhred, T, &amp; Chester, A. (2010). The Experience of Class Tutors in a Peer Tutoring Programme: A Novel Theoretical Framework, Australasian Journal of Peer Learning, 3(1), 12-23. Available at: http://ro.uow.edu.au/ajpl/vol3/iss1/3&lt;/ref&gt; Using grounded theory techniques, it was found that the following five themes underlie their experiences: role exploration, sharing responsibility, regulation of the peer tutored groups, harnessing the peer tutors’ role, and community (see article for further detail).

[[ESL]] training can be separated from regular tutor training as a subject that contains special difficulties that must be dealt with on their own. Tutoring in an [[Online Writing Lab]] can also be separated from normal training.

Stated by Goodlad and Sinclair, "Peer tutoring is the system of instruction in which learners help each other and learn by teaching. Tutoring schemes have been used in a variety of context, with students teaching students, students teaching school pupils, non-professional adults teaching adults and children, and pupils teaching pupils." {{sfn|eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED311006&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED311006|1989|p=1}}

The '''Performing Arts Training Center''' (PATC) was opened in 1967 in [[East St. Louis, Illinois]] by world-renowned African American dancer [[Katherine Dunham]] who was then Artist-in-Residence at [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]]. Dunham partnered with SIUE's Experiment in Higher Education to add educational resources to the program and give the youth of East St. Louis a better educational experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siue.edu/graduate/iur/history/dunham-dance.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720011535/http://www.siue.edu/graduate/iur/history/dunham-dance.shtml |archivedate=2014-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/feature/Giving_Guide_2011/2011/12/southern-illinois-university.html?page=all&lt;/ref&gt;

The PATC (later known as the Katherine Dunham Center for the Performing Arts) offered credit and non-credit courses in such arts as dance, martial arts, and crafts. At times, its company of dancers has toured widely. Now known as the Performing Arts Program, it is a part of  SIUE's [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville#East St. Louis Center|East St. Louis Center]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siue.edu/news/archives/ArchivesMAR2014.shtml#SIUEEastStLouisCentertoHostBirthdayFestivitiesfortheCity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stlamerican.com/entertainment/living_it/article_99918fa0-5efe-11e1-9795-0019bb2963f4.html?mode=image&amp;photo=0&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Prime Minister's Prizes for Science''' are annual [[Australian]] awards for outstanding achievements in scientific research, innovation, and teaching. The prizes have been awarded since 2000, when they replaced the [[Australia Prize]] for science.

The major awards are the Prime Minister's Prize for Science, regarded as the national award for the advancement of knowledge through science,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.gov.au/community/PrimeMinistersPrizesforScience/Pages/Prime-Ministers-Prize-for-Science-and-Prime-Ministers-Prize-for-Innovation.aspx Department of Industry, Innovation and Science]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Prime Minister’s Prize for Innovation (created in 2015), as the national award for  translation of science into commercial outcomes. In 2016, an additional Prize for New Innovators was also created. 

The Frank Fenner Prize for Life Scientist of the Year (previously known as the Science Minister's Prize for Science&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.gov.au/community/PrimeMinistersPrizesforScience/Pages/Frank-Fenner-and-Malcolm-McIntosh-Prizes.aspx Department of Industry, Innovation and Science]&lt;/ref&gt;) and the Malcolm McIntosh Prize for Physical Scientist of the Year were also created in 2000. Prizes for excellence in science teaching at primary and secondary schools were added in 2002.

==History of the Prime Minister's Prizes for Science==
The Australia Prize was the predecessor award to the Prime Minister's Prizes for Science and was awarded annually from 1990 to 1999 (although no award was made in 1991). It was an international award, aimed at a worldwide audience for an outstanding specific achievement in a selected area of science and technology promoting human welfare. It achieved widespread recognition by individuals and organisations throughout the world, receiving nominations from 18 countries.

The Government awarded the Australia Prize to both Australian and international scientists. Of the 28 recipients, 18 were Australian, demonstrating Australia's strong international standing in many scientific fields.

The Australia Prize was replaced in 2000 by the current set of prizes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://grants.innovation.gov.au/SciencePrize/Pages/PreviousPrizeWinners.aspx Australia Prize 1990–1999, Prime Minister's Prizes for Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127005629/http://grants.innovation.gov.au/SciencePrize/Pages/PreviousPrizeWinners.aspx |date=27 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project MUSE''', a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] collaboration between libraries and publishers, is an online database of [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/about/muse_journals_list.html|title=Project MUSE - Journals in  Project MUSE|website=muse.jhu.edu|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[electronic book]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/browse/titles/all?browse_view_type=list&amp;limit_content_type=book|title=Project MUSE - Browse|website=muse.jhu.edu|access-date=2016-07-16}} &lt;/ref&gt; Project MUSE provides access to digital [[humanities]] and [[social science]] content from over 250 [[university press]]es and [[scholarly societies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/about/publishers.html|title=Project MUSE - MUSE Publishers|website=muse.jhu.edu|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; around the world.

The goal of the project is to disseminate high-quality scholarly material through an affordable and sustainable model that meets the needs of libraries, publishers, and scholars. MUSE’s online journal collections are available on a subscription basis to [[Academic library|academic]], [[Public library|public]], [[Special library|special]], and [[School library|school libraries]]. Currently, more than 2,500 libraries worldwide subscribe. Electronic book collections became available for institutional purchase in January 2012. Thousands of scholarly books are available on the platform. 

==History==
Project MUSE was founded in 1993 as a joint project between the [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] and the [[Milton S. Eisenhower Library#Milton S. Eisenhower Library|Milton S. Eisenhower Library]] at the [[Johns Hopkins University]].  With grants from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], Project MUSE was launched online alongside the JHU Press Journals in 1995.  Beginning in 2000, journals from other scholarly publishers were integrated into MUSE’s online collections.  Additional publishers have added journals each subsequent year. In January 2012, a new interface was launched which incorporated its current journal collection with electronic books published by members of the University Press Content Consortium (UPCC). 

==Journals==
Project MUSE offers tiered-pricing structures to meet budgetary and research needs of subscribing institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/about/order/journal_collections.html|title=Project MUSE  - Journal Collections|work=jhu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subscribers may choose from four interdisciplinary journal collections, as well as two broad discipline collections in the humanities or social sciences.  Content is grouped into seventeen interdisciplinary research areas: Area and Ethnic Studies; Art and Architecture; Creative Writing; Education; Film, Theater, and Performing Arts; History; Language and Linguistics; Library Science and Publishing; Literature; Medicine and Health; Music; Philosophy; Religion; Science, Technology, and Mathematics; Social Sciences; Studies by Time Period; Women’s Studies, Gender, and Sexuality.

Project MUSE is the sole source of full-text versions of journal titles from a number of university presses and scholarly societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/about/muse_journals_list.html|title=Project MUSE - Journals in  Project MUSE|work=jhu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Journals are published electronically at the same time as their print counterparts and remain available permanently within the database.  Subscribing libraries are not required to maintain a print subscription to the same journals they access through Project MUSE.  Although much of the journal content consists of current publications, archival issues of many of its journals are regularly added to the database.  More than 600 journals from over 250 university presses and scholarly publishers are available. Of the 600+ journals in the database, more than 100 of them include complete runs.

A number of resources are provided including tutorials, instructional materials, and subject guides.  End-users have the capability to search the database and, if affiliated with a subscribing institution, immediately retrieve content in 100% [[Full text database|full-text]] [[PDF]] or [[HTML]] formats.  The complete content of each journal is available in the database, including all charts, graphics, and images.  MUSE supports various research and discovery tools such as [[social bookmarking]], citation management functions, and [[RSS]] feeds. Subscription licenses allow unlimited simultaneous access to its content, as well as the ability to retrieve content through [[interlibrary loan]].

==Books==
Supported by two grants from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], The University Press e-book Consortium (UPeC) emerged in 2009 to explore the feasibility of, and later develop, a university press-based e-book initiative that would balance the interests of both the publishing and library communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/about/UPCC.html#origin_UPeC|title=Project MUSE  - UPCC Books on Project MUSE|work=jhu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 2011, UPeC announced its partnership with Project MUSE, and the University Press Content Consortium (UPCC) Book Collections on Project MUSE was established.  Launched in January 2012, the UPCC Book Collections consist of thousands of peer-reviewed book titles from major university presses and related scholarly publishers.  Book collections are fully integrated with MUSE’s electronic journal collections, allowing users to search across books and journals simultaneously or limit searches by content type.

All content from the print editions of the electronic books are full-text, accessible in PDF format, and fully searchable and retrievable at the chapter level.  No [[Digital rights management|Digital Rights Management (DRM)]] are attached, allowing users to print, copy, download, and save content. Books available in the collections contain current publications that are released simultaneously as their print versions.

The UPCC Book Collections on Project MUSE include a range of current humanities and social science scholarly titles.  Books are available for purchase by publication date or through fourteen subject-based collections: Archaeology and Anthropology; Ecology and Evolution; Classical Studies; Film, Theater, and Performing Arts; Global Cultural Studies; Higher Education; History; Language and Linguistics; Literature; Philosophy and Religion; Psychology; Poetry, Fiction, and Creative Non-Fiction; Political Science and Policy Studies; United States Regional Studies. Additionally, eight Area Studies Collections are available: African, American, Asian and Pacific, Jewish, Latin American and Caribbean, Middle Eastern, Native American and Indigenous, and Russian and East European.

Two subscription options that provide access only (no ownership) are available to institutions. The Current Subscription provides access to all UPCC books in MUSE published or due to be published in the current year or prior two years; the Archival Subscription provides access to all UPCC books published more than three years prior. 

In November 2012, Project MUSE and YBP Library Services formed a partnership to sell single book titles from the University Press Content Consortium (UPCC) on the MUSE platform.

The '''Razak Report''' is a [[Federation of Malaya|Malayan]] educational proposal written in the 1956.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0000/000090/009059eb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Named after the then Education Minister, [[Tun Abdul Razak]], its goal was to reform the [[Education in Malaysia|education system in Malaya]].&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt; The report was incorporated into the Section 3 of the Education Ordinance of 1957 and served the basis of the educational framework for independent Malaya and eventually [[Malaysia]]. Private schools were nationalized, education was expanded at all levels and was heavily subsidized, and indeed the growth in enrollment rate again accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/college/coll-china-education-001.html|title=Historical Background: Expansion of Public Education|last=Berci|first=Liqing Tao, Margaret|date=2006-03-23|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-13|last2=He|first2=Wayne|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Razak Report is a compromise between the [[Barnes Report]] (favoured by the Malays) and the [[Fenn-Wu Report]] (favoured by the Chinese and Indians). The Barnes Report was formerly passed into law as the Education Ordinance of 1952. While the Razak Report forwards the [[Malay language]] as the main medium of instruction, {{Fact|date=March 2009}} it allows the retention of other language medium schools.

The Report provides for Malay, English, Chinese and Tamil schools at the primary school level, and Malay and English schools at the secondary school level. Malay-medium schools are referred to as "national" schools while other schools are referred to as "national-type" schools. All schools are government-funded and use a common national curriculum regardless of school type.

Other provisions include:
* Formation of a single system of national education
* Commencement of a Malayan-orientated curriculum
* Conception of a single system of evaluation for all
* Recognition of the eventual objective of making [[Malay language|Bahasa Melayu]] the main medium of instruction

==Rahman Talib Report==
In 1960, the Rahman Talib Report was introduced and incorporated in the Education Act 1961.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt; Among others, it called for:
* Stress on 3M basic education - ''Membaca, Menulis, dan Mengira'' (reading, writing and arithmetic)
* Stress on a strong spiritual education and the desired elements of discipline
* Stress on a Malayan curriculum
* Upper secondary education of two streams, academic and vocational
* Opportunity to continue education from 9 years to 11 years
* Facilitation of education management procedures to improve the overall quality of education

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2809">'''Ronald Giere''' is an American [[Philosophy of Science|philosopher of science]] who is an emeritus professor of philosophy at the [[University of Minnesota]]. He is a Fellow of The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]], a long-time member of the editorial board of the journal ''Philosophy of Science'', and a past president of the [[Philosophy of Science Association]]. His current research focuses on agent-based accounts of models and scientific representation, and on connections between naturalism and secularism.

==Work==
In his book ''Scientific Perspectivism'' he develops a version of perspectival realism in which he argues that scientific descriptions are somewhat like colours, in that they capture only selected aspects of reality, and those aspects are not bits of the world seen as they are in themselves, but bits of the world seen from a distinctive human perspective. In addition to the color example, Giere articulates his perspectivism by appeal to maps and to his own earlier and influential work on scientific models. Maps represent the world, but the representations they provide are conventional, affected by interest, and never fully accurate or complete. Similarly, scientific models are idealized structures that represent the world from particular and limited points of view. According to Giere, what goes for colors, maps, and models goes generally: science is perspectival through and through.&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Scientific Perspectivism'' in [[Science (journal)|Science]] 11 May 2007: Vol. '''316'''. no. 5826, p. 834 {{doi|10.1126/science.1141366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
In addition to many papers in the philosophy of science, he is the author of:
* ''Understanding Scientific Reasoning'' (5th ed 2006);
* ''Explaining Science: A Cognitive Approach'' (1988)
* ''Science Without Laws'' (1999)
* ''Scientific Perspectivism'' (2006), Chicago, University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|978-0-226-29212-0}}

He has also edited several volumes of papers in the philosophy of science, including, most recently, ''Cognitive Models of Science'' (1992) and ''Origins of Logical Empiricism'' (1996).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5932">'''Same language subtitling''' ('''SLS''') refers to the practice of [[subtitling]] programs on TV in the same language as the audio. Initially introduced in the early 1970s as a means to make services available to the hard of hearing, [[Closed captioning]] as it became known was standardized for Latin alphabets in the 1976 [[World System Teletext]] agreement. Non-Latin character set services have subsequently been introduced, and are used in [[India]], and in China to also aid literacy.

In the mid 1980s Pioneer introduced a range of [[Laserdisc]] Karaoke machines, with subtitled Music video playback combined with a [[Karaoke]] PA system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jg8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41-IA3&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Billboard - Karaoke Japan|date=30 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; the technology was transferred to the PlayStation 2, and later games consoles, and has in parallel been adapted to classroom use of synchronized [[captioning]] of [[Musical theater|musical]] lyrics (or any text with an Audio and/or Video source) as a Repeated Reading activity.

The 1996 [[DVD-Video]] standard was published with support for up to 32 separate synchronised subtitling streams to be packaged with a video file.

== Literacy promotion ==
This idea was struck upon by [[Brij Kothari]], who believed that SLS makes reading practice an incidental, automatic, and subconscious part of popular TV entertainment, at a low per-person cost to shore up [[Literacy in India|literacy rates in India]].&lt;ref name=AshokaBrij&gt;''[http://www.ashoka.org/fellow/3557 Brij Kothari] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828182628/http://www.ashoka.org/fellow/3557 |date=2008-08-28 }}'' from  [http://www.ashoka.org/ Ashoka.org]. Accessed on February 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFF1&gt;Biswas, Ranjita (2005). ''[http://www.asianfilm.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=98 Hindi film songs can boost literacy rates in India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820005707/http://www.asianfilm.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=98 |date=2009-08-20 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

Brij Kothari was watching a Spanish film on video with English subtitles during a break from dissertation writing in 1996 when the thought hit him that if all Hindi film songs were subtitled in Hindi, on television in India, it would bring about a revolution in literacy. Upon completion of his academic pursuits Kothari returned to India. In late 1996 he joined the faculty of the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad. While continuing to teach communication to MBA students, he started work on SLS and it became a project of IIM. The idea of SLS was first innovated, researched, pioneered and nationalized by the Centre for Educational Innovation, [[Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad]] under Brij Kothari.&lt;ref name=AshokaBrij/&gt; The program took off on a national scale by August 2002.&lt;ref name=AshokaBrij/&gt;

Before Kothari's study, most available research on captioning had demonstrated limited results. As a direct result of Kothari's success with subtitled music video there are several new related studies using technology and music video that are also showing remarkable results.

=== Implementation ===
During the last 10 years in India, SLS has been implemented on Doordarshan's film song programmes in [[Hindi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada]], [[Malayalam]], [[Oriya language|Oriya]], and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. For each language the subtitles are in the same language as the audio.

A 2002–2007 Nielsen-ORG study demonstrated that the ability to read a paragraph among schoolchildren jumped from 25% to 56% when exposed to 30 minutes a week of the Rangoli program with subtitles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Das |first=Gurcharan |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/rssarticleshow/msid-2929385,prtpage-1.cms |title=Power of subtitles - MEN &amp; IDEAS - Gurcharan Das |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2008-04-06 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 90% said they prefer having subtitles on songs owing to their interest in the lyrics.&lt;ref name=Wilkins1&gt;Kothari, Brij (2000). "10: Same Language Subtitling on Indian Television". ''Redeveloping Communication for Social Change: Theory, Practice, and Power''. Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield. pp. 135-146. {{ISBN|0-8476-9588-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic SLS reading activity involves students viewing a short subtitled presentation projected on-screen, while completing a response worksheet. Ideally, the subtitling should have high quality synchronization of audio and text, text should change colors in syllabic synchronization to audio model, and the source media should be dynamic and engaging.&lt;ref&gt;McCall, W.

== Outside India ==

[[Chinese-language]] programmes are often subtitled, because speakers of other [[varieties of Chinese]] can read [[Standard Written Chinese]], even if they cannot understand the spoken dialect.

'''Smart Way Reading and Spelling''' is a commercial brand of [[reading instruction]] methodology and materials that was developed in 2001 by Bright Sky Learning.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:smartwayreading.jpg|right|thumb|alt=alt text|Smart Way Reading and Spelling]]
Over two years in development, Smart Way Reading and Spelling is designed to be simple to use yet it is extremely efficient in teaching students. The [[Reading (process)|reading]] methodology ranges from teaching introductory sounds and how to learn [[American English]] through advanced reading strategies. The program has been used effectively in remedial reading programs &lt;ref&gt;''Overview of the Results of the Bright Sky Learning, Lancaster-Lebanon Intermediate Unit 13, School District of Lancaster Tutoring Research Project'', by Lana Edwards Santoro, Ph.D., Education Associates; Angela Kirby-Wehr, M.Ed., Pennsylvania Training and Technical Assistance Network (PaTTAN); and, Edward S. Shapiro, Ph.D., Lehigh University, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smartwayreading.com/Research_Study.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716093413/http://www.smartwayreading.com/Research_Study.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in states across the country with positive and consistent results and is based on the most complete scientific research on teaching reading which stresses systematic and explicit [[phonics]] coupled with [[reading comprehension]] and [[fluency]].&lt;ref&gt;National Reading Panel report&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smart Way Reading and Spelling program is presented in a series of twenty-seven individual flip chart lessons. Each flip chart contains a complete lesson that includes both the student and coach materials within one bound booklet. The student sees an image or text on one side of the flip chart, while the reading coach has his scripted instructions on the other side with a mirror image of what the student sees. The completely scripted nature of the program allows even the most novice coach to work with a student immediately. Extensive training is not necessary. Over time, as the coach becomes more confident, he can add more creativity and interaction in working with students. Rather than stressing individual [[phonetic]] rules for the sake of teaching rules, the Smart Way methodology introduces words and word patterns in families, helping students grasp the key [[phonetic]] rules through a cognitive learning process. The program was designed as both a complete learning system for youngsters and as an intervention method for older students and adults. Though results will vary, most students will complete each lesson in one to two hours.

== Additional Research Base of the Program ==

The delivery of the Smart Way Reading and Spelling program is based on the concept of self-efficacy and its application in instructional practices.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1986) ''[[Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory]]''. Prentice Hall Professional Technical Reference&lt;/ref&gt; The gradual, systematic approach allows students to develop their skills and increase their confidence. Explicit, systematic instruction is recognized as having a direct impact on student success, especially in low-achieving students and supports its use in [[phonics]] instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, M.E. (2004), Adolescents who struggle with word identification: Research and practice, in Adolescent literacy research and practice, T.L. Jetton and J.A. Dole, Editors. The Guilford Press: New York. p. 119-134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kamil, M., (Nov 2003), Adolescents and literacy: Reading in the 21st century. Alliance for Excellent Education.&lt;/ref&gt; As well, research shows phonics instruction is useful to students of all ages &lt;ref&gt;Curtis, M.E., &amp; Longo, A.M. (1999).

'''TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)''' is education and training which provides knowledge and skills for employment.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-UNEVOC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=What+is+TVET|title=What is TVET?|date=28 August 2017|website=UNESCO-UNEVOC|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; TVET uses [[Formal learning|formal]], [[Nonformal learning|non-formal]] and [[informal learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/skills-work-and-life|title=Skills for work and life|last=|first=|date=|website=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|archiveurl=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; TVET is recognised to be a crucial vehicle for [[social equity]], inclusion and sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233030e.pdf|title=Unleashing the Potential: Transforming Technical and Vocational Education and Training|last=Marope|first=P.T.M.|last2=Chakroun|first2=B.|last3=Holmes|first3=K.P.|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100091-1|pages=9-10, 41, 43, 47-48, 56-58, 63, 80, 95, 98-103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of the term TVET ==
The term 'Technical and Vocational Education and Training' or TVET was officiated at the World Congress on TVET in 1999 in [[Seoul|Seoul, Republic of Korea]]. The congress recognised the term TVET to be broad enough to incorporate other terms that had been used to describe similar educational and training activities including Workforce Education (WE), and Technical-Vocational Education (TVE). The term TVET parallels other types of education and training e.g [[Vocational education|Vocational Education]] but is also used as an umbrella term to encompass education and training activities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=What+is+TVET|title=What is TVET?|last=UNESCO-UNEVOC|first=|date=|website=www.unevoc.unesco.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision in 1999 to officiate the term TVET led to the development of the [[UNESCO-UNEVOC]] International Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training in [[Bonn, Germany]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Hybridisation ==
Because of TVET′s isolation with other education streams it was not widely adopted, in particularly in secondary education. Steps were taken to reduce segmentation of education and training and to address institutional barriers that restricted TVET learners′ options including choices to move vertically to higher levels of learning, or horizontally to other streams.

Policy-makers have introduced forms of hybridization with other education systems, additionally some of the distinctions between TVET and ′academic′ education streams have been blurred.&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, R. and Pavlova, M. 2011. Vocationalisation of secondary and higher education: pathways to the world of work. UNESCO-UNEVOC, ''Revisiting Global Trends in TVET: Reflections on Theory and Practice''. Bonn, Germany, UNESCO-UNEVOC International Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training, pp. 40–85.&lt;/ref&gt; This hybridisation has been termed the ′vocationalization of secondary education′, a similar process has happened to a lesser extent in tertiary education.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== France and the Netherlands ===
The [[Baccalauréat|baccalauréat professionnel]] in [[France]], and the [[Education in the Netherlands|middelbaar beroepsonderwijs]] (MBO) ount of work experience in the area they are specializing in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Germany and Austria ===
Apprenticeships enhanced content within occupational training courses and considerable emphasis has been placed on personal skills.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== India ===
Work education has been included in the primary standards (grades 1–8) to make the students aware of work. At the lower secondary level (grades 9–10) pre-vocational education has been included with the aim to increase students’ familiarity with the world of work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Republic of Korea ===
Around 40% of secondary students are currently enrolled in TVET education, in some schools, academic and vocational students share almost 75% of the curriculum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Russian Federation ===
A new approach to vocationalization of secondary schooling has been introduced within the framework of general educational reform. This has been guided by the Ministry of Education’s strategy of modernization. Vocationalization in the Russian Federation refers to the introduction of profile education at the upper-secondary level (the last two years of schooling, grades 10 and 11) and the process of preparation for profile selection. Profile education provided students with the opportunity to study a chosen area in depth, usually one that would be related to their further study (TVET or academic). Schools could design their own profiles, e.g science, socio-economics, humanities, and technology, or keep a general orientation curriculum. In preparation for the upper-secondary specialization, a ′pre-profiling′ programme in grade 9 has been introduced to help students make their choices in grade 10.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== United States of America ===
Tech-prep programmes in the [[United States|United States of America]] are examples of how the ′blending′ approach was used to help students make the connections between school and work. In year nine, programmes in broad occupational fields such as the health professions, [[Automotive tecnology|automotive technology]], computer systems networking are offered within general technology studies. The programmes continue for at least two years after the end of secondary school, through a tertiary education or an apprenticeship programme, with students achieving an associate degree or certificate by the end of the programme.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Private sector ==
Private TVET providers include [[for-profit]] and [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] institutions. Several factors triggered actions to support the expansion of private TVET including the limited capacities of public TVET providers and their low responsiveness to enterprises and trainees. Private TVET providers were expected to be more responsive because they were subject to fewer bureaucratic restrictions than public institutions (particularly in centralized systems). Their presence was expected to help raise quality system-wide, in many developing countries, government budgets constituted a vulnerable and unreliable source of financing for TVET, an important objective was to finance TVET systems by increasing the contribution of beneficiaries, including employers and trainees.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Private TVET provision over since 2005 has become a significant and growing part of TVET in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, R. K. and Adams, A. V. 2004. ''Skills Development in Sub-Saharan Africa''. Washington, DC, World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;ETF and World Bank. 2005. ''Reforming Technical Vocational Education and Training in the Middle East and North Africa: Experiences and Challenges''. Luxembourg, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities.&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, e.g [[Lebanon]], enrolments in private TVET institutions have exceeded enrolments in public institutions. In [[Jordan]], private provision at the community college level has been promoted by the government.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However not all experiences has been positive with private proprietary institutions or [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], their courses have often been concentrated in professional areas that typically do not require large capital investment, permitting easy entry and exit by private providers from the sector. Quality issues have also emerged, where market information about quality has been unavailable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Technological advancement and its impact==
TVET has an important role to play in technology diffusion through transfer of knowledge and skills. Rapid technological progress has had and continues to have significant implications for TVET. Understanding and anticipating changes has become crucial for designing responsive TVET systems and, more broadly, effective skills policies. The flexibility to adapt the supply of skills to the rapidly, and in some cases radically, changing needs in sectors such as [[information technology]] and the [[green economy]] has become a central feature of TVET systems. Globally, the skills requirements and qualifications demanded for job entry are rising. This reflects a need for not just a more knowledgeable and skilled workforce, but one that can adapt quickly to new emerging technologies in a cycle of continuous learning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

TVET courses have been created to respond to the diverse [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] needs of learners, whether these are related to work, education or citizenship. New courses have been introduced to address occupational changes in the ICT job market, while many TVET providers have shifted provision towards a blended approach, with significantly more self-directed and/or [[Distance education|distance learning]]. In developed countries, new ICT approaches have been introduced to modernize TVET organizations and to manage administration and finance, including learner records.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Education for all ==
{{main|Education For All}}

The Education for All (EFA) movement has had its own implications for TVET at both international and national levels. The third EFA goal lacked precision and measurable targets for TVET, however it called for ensuring ′that the learning needs of all young people and adults are met through equitable access to appropriate learning and life-skills programmes′.&lt;ref&gt;World Conference on Education for All. 2000. ''The Dakar Framework for Action: Meeting our Collective Commitments to Education for All''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; This goal had a symbolic value, helping to raise the visibility of TVET and skills development and create a more prominent place for them on the global education policy agenda. The current bulge of young people requiring TVET learning opportunities is partly fuelled by the success of the EFA movement in opening access to [[basic education]], particularly at the primary level. In 2009, 702 million children were enrolled worldwide in primary education, compared with 646 million in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Statistics. 2006. ''Participation in Formal Technical and Vocational Education and Training Programmes Worldwide: An Initial Statistical Study''. Bonn. UNESCO-UNEVOC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Continuing TVET ==
Continuing TVET involves ongoing training to upgrade existing skills and to develop new ones and has a much higher profile in ageing societies and knowledge-based economies. Increased recognition of the importance of human capital for economic growth and social development made it necessary to increase learning opportunities for adults in workplaces within the wider context of policies and strategies for lifelong learning.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. 2005. ''Promoting Adult Learning, Education and Training Policy''. Paris, OECD Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In many countries policy-makers have considered ways to expand workplace learning opportunities for workers and to assess and give credit for knowledge and skills acquired in workplaces. Efforts were geared towards training for workers in companies, encouraged by legislation, financial incentives and contractual agreements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Challenges ==
=== Labour market demands and trends ===
Following the [[Global financial crisis in 2009|global financial crisis in 2008]], labour markets across the world experienced structural changes that influenced the demand for skills and TVET. [[Unemployment]] worsened and the quality of jobs decreased, especially for [[youth]]. Gender differentials in labour force participation placed men ahead of women, and skill mismatches deepened. The crisis impacted labour markets adversely and led to deepening uncertainty, vulnerability of employment, and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Bacchetta, M. and Jansen, M. (eds). 2011. ''Making Globalisation Socially Sustainable''. Geneva, ILO and WTO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, measures to improve efficiency and profitability in the economic recovery have often led to [[jobless recovery|jobless growth]], as happened in [[Algeria]], [[India]] and [[post-apartheid South Africa]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In seeking to address the level of vulnerable employment, TVET systems have focused on increasing the employability of graduates and enhancing their capacity to function effectively within existing vulnerable labour markets and to adjust to other labour market constraints. This has meant enhanced coordination among government departments responsible for TVET and employment policies. It has also created the need for TVET systems to develop mechanisms that identify skills needs early on and make better use of labour market information for matching skills demands and supply. TVET systems have focused more on developing immediate job skills and wider competencies. This has been accomplished by adopting competency-based approaches to instruction and workplace learning that enable learners to handle vulnerable employment, adjust to changing jobs and career contexts, and build their capacity to learn and agility to adapt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Migration flows ===
Increasing migration are significant challenges to the national character of TVET systems and qualifications. TVET qualifications are progressively expected not only to serve as proxies for an individual's competencies but to also act as a form of a currency that signals national and international value.&lt;ref&gt;Leney, T. 2009a. ''Qualifications that Count: Strengthening the Recognition of Qualifications in the Mediterranean Region''. Thematic Study. Turin, Italy, ETF. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.etf.europa.eu/web&lt;/nowiki&gt;. nsf/(RSS)/C125782B0048D6F6C125768200396FB6?OpenDocument&amp;LAN=EN&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; TVET systems have been developing mechanisms to enable credible and fair cross-border recognition of skills. In 2007, the [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] identified three types of recognition that TVET system may use: unilateral (independent assessment by the receiving country), mutual (agreements between sending and receiving countries), and multilateral (mostly between a regional grouping of countries). The most prevalent of these is unilateral recognition, which is mostly under the control of national credential evaluation agencies. Countries have been slow to move from input-based skill evaluations to outcome-based methodologies that focus on competencies attained.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Keevy, J. 2011. ''The recognition of qualifications across borders: the contribution of regional qualifications frameworks''. Background paper commissioned by UNESCO. Pretoria, South African Qualifications Authority.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

TVET systems are responding to migration by providing qualifications that can stand the rigour of these recognition systems and by creating frameworks for mutual recognition of qualifications. Regional Qualifications Frameworks such as those in [[Southern Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Caribbean]] aim to significantly support the recognition of qualifications across borders.&lt;ref&gt;Keevy, J., Chakroun, B. and Deij, A. 2010. ''Transnational Qualifications Frameworks''. Luxembourg, Publications Office of the European Union.&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts are further supported through the introduction of outcome-based learning methodologies within the broader context of multilateral recognition agreements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Providing broader competencies alongside specialist skills===
Skills for economic development include a mix of technical and [[soft skills]]. Empirical evidence and TVET policy reviews conducted by [[UNESCO]] suggest that TVET systems may not as yet sufficiently support the development of the so-called soft competencies.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2013b. ''Policy Review of TVET in Cambodia''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0022/002253/225360e.pdf#xml=&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?database=&amp;set=53761B39_2_350&amp;hits_rec=2&amp;hits_lng=eng&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2013c. ''Policy Review of TVET in Lao PDR''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0022/002211/221146e.pdf#xml=&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?datab&lt;/nowiki&gt; ase=&amp;set=53761918_0_231&amp;hits_rec=2&amp;hits_lng=eng&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2013d. ''Revue de politiques de formation technique et professionnelle au Benin''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002213/221304f.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries have, however, adopted competency-based approaches as measures for reforming TVET curricula.

The [[HEART Trust National Training Agency]] of [[Jamaica]] adopted this approach, with a particular emphasis on competency standards and balanced job-specific and generic skills. Competency standards aimed to ensure that the training was linked to industry and was up to date, and that competences were integrated into training programmes, along with the needed knowledge, skills and attitudes. The balancing of skill types was to ensure adequate attention was given to job-specific skills as well as the conceptual and experiential knowledge necessary to enable individuals to grow and develop in the workplace, and more generally in society.&lt;ref&gt;HEART Trust NTA. 2009. ''Policy on competency-based education and training''. Draft Concept Paper. Kingston, HEART Trust NTA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Globalization ===
Globalization of the economy and the consequent reorganization of the workplace require a more adaptable labour force, requiring countries to rethink the nature and role of TVET. Globalization intensifies pressure on the TVET sector to supply the necessary skills to workers involved in globalized activity and to adapt existing skills to rapidly changing needs. As a consequence, there is an increasing requirement for more demand-driven TVET systems with a greater focus on modular and competency-based programmes, as well as on cognitive and transferable skills, which are expected to help people adapt to unpredictable conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Promoting social equity and inclusive workplaces ===
Preparing marginalized groups of youths and adults with the right skills and helping them make the transition from school to work is part of the problem faced by TVET in promoting social equity. Ensuring that the workplace is inclusive poses numerous policy challenges, depending on the contextual dynamics of inclusion and exclusion, and the capabilities of individuals. For example, the experiences of exclusion by people with [[Disability|disabilities]] and disadvantaged women may be similar in some ways and different in others. Many individuals experience multiple forms of disadvantage in the workplace, to different degrees of severity, depending on social attitudes and traditions in a specific context or organization. Approaches to inclusiveness in the workplace will therefore vary according to population needs, social diversity and context. To give one example, the Netherlands set about the task of making workplaces more inclusive for low-skilled adults by offering programmes that combine language instruction with work, and in certain cases on-the-job training.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. 2012. ''Better Skills Better Jobs Better Lives – OECD: A Strategic Approach to Skills Policies''. Paris, OECD Publishing. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/better-skills-better-jobs-&lt;/nowiki&gt; better-lives_9789264177338-en&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A review of employer surveys in [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States|United States of America]], reported that employers valued people with disabilities for their high levels of motivation and their diverse perspectives, and found their attendance records to be the same or better than those of other employees.&lt;ref&gt;Employers’ Forum on Disability. 2009. What does the research say are the commercial bene ts? &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.realising-potential.org/six-building-blocks/commercial/what-researchers-&lt;/nowiki&gt; say.html&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Many employers mentioned that being seen as pro-inclusion was positive for the company or organization's image, an advantage that goes well beyond&amp;nbsp;providing employment opportunities to disadvantaged groups. In many cases, however, social and cultural perceptions are an obstacle to making workplaces more inclusive, and this will require sensitive and concerted attention. Some low- and middle-income countries have sought to address this through legislation. In [[Tanzania]] the [[Disabled Persons (Employment) Act of 1982]] established a quota system that stipulates that 2 per cent of the workforce in companies with over fifty employees must be persons with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;SADC and UNESCO. 2011. ''Final Report: Status of TVET in the SADC Region''. Gaborone, SADC, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The 2012 [[Education for All Global Monitoring Report]] concluded that 'all countries, regardless of income level, need to pay greater attention to the needs of young people who face disadvantage in education and skills development by virtue of their poverty, gender or other characteristics'.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;UNESCO. 2012. ''Youth and Skills: Putting Education to Work''. EFA Global Monitoring Report. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002180/218003e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The report found that several barriers and constraints reduced the success of TVET in meeting social equity demands. First, national TVET policies in most cases failed to address the skills needs of young people living in urban poverty and in deprived rural areas. Second, additional funds were needed to support TVET learning opportunities on a much larger scale. Third, the training needs of disadvantaged young women were particularly neglected. The 2012 EFA Global Monitoring Report also noted that skills training alone was not sufficient for the most disadvantaged of the rural and urban poor.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Coherent policies that link social protection, micro-finance and TVET are considered critical for ensuring better outcomes for marginalized groups.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Gender disparities ===
Recent years have seen rising numbers of young women enrolling in TVET programmes, especially in service sector subjects. At times the challenge is to bring more males into female-dominated streams. However, beyond number games, the real gender parity test that TVET systems are yet to pass is balancing the gender participation in programmes that lead to employability, as well as to decent and high-paying jobs. Gender disparities in learning opportunities, and earnings, are a cause for concern. The persistent gender-typing of TVET requires concerted attention if TVET is to really serve a key facilitative role in shared growth, [[social equity]] and [[inclusive development]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233030e.pdf|title=Unleashing the Potential: Transforming Technical and Vocational Education and Training|last=Marope|first=P.T.M|last2=Chakroun|first2=B.|last3=Holmes|first3=K.P.|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100091-1|location=|pages=20, 53, 85, 163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of work, poor quality of work, lack of voice at work, continued gender discrimination and unacceptably high youth unemployment are all major drivers of TVET system reforms from the perspective of social equity. This is an area where TVET systems continue to be challenged to contribute proactively to the shaping of more equitable societies.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Gender equality has received significant international attention in recent years, and this has been reflected in a reduction in gender participation gaps in both [[Primary education|primary]] and [[Secondary education|secondary schooling]]. Efforts to analyse and address gender equality in TVET are relevant to other aspects of equity and dimensions of inclusion/exclusion. In almost all parts of the world, the proportion of girls to total enrolment in secondary education defined as TVET is less than for 'general' secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Statistics. 2012.

==== Responses ====

===== Bangladesh =====
Integrating women or men into areas of specialization in which they were previously under-represented is important to diversifying opportunities for TVET. The [[National Strategy for Promotion of Gender Equality in TVET]] in [[Bangladesh]] set clear priorities and targets for breaking gender stereotypes. The Strategy developed by a Gender Working Group comprising  fifteen representatives from government ministries and departments, employers, workers and civil society organizations. It provided an overview of the current status and nature of gender inequalities in TVET, highlighted the priority areas for action, explored a number of steps to promote equal participation of women in TVET, and outlined the way forward.&lt;ref&gt;ILO. 2012b.

===== Cambodia =====
In [[Cambodia]], TVET programmes set out to empower young women in traditional trades by upgrading their skills and technology in [[silk weaving]]. This led to the revitalization and reappraisal of a traditional craft by learners and society.&lt;ref&gt;Salzano, E. 2005. ''Technology-Based Training for Marginalised Girls''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===== The Shanghai Consensus of the Third International Congress on TVET =====
The Shanghai Consensus of the Third International Congress on TVET made the following recommendations on expanding access and improving quality and equity, including to:&amp;nbsp;

"Improve [[gender equality]] by promoting equal access of females and males to TVET programmes, particularly in fields where there is strong labour market demand, and by ensuring that TVET curricula and materials avoid stereotyping by gender."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2012.
