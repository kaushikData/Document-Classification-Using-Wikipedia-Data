'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to public information is guaranteed by the Constitution of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] (Article 16). To implement this constitutional right, the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia in January 2006 adopted the Law on Free Access to Public Information defining the procedures for exercising this right. The Law has been significantly amended at the beginning of 2010.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu&gt;{{cite journal |author=Suzana Dzamtoska-Zdravkovska|date=2012 |title=Free Access to Public Information - More Transparency, Less Corruption: The case of Republic of Macedonia |url=https://www.academia.edu/3023686/Free_Access_to_Public_Information-More_Transparency_Less_Corruption_The_Case_of_Republic_of_Macedonia |publisher=eprints.ugd.edu.mk |issue= |access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a research carried out by the [[Centre for Law and Democracy]], Macedonia is in the high 14th place on the world ranking list of states having the most functional law on free access to public information, despite the fact that this right has been introduced into Macedonian legal system in a relatively recent period.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt; However, according to the [[European Commission]], the implementation of the Law on Free Access to Public Information remains ineffective.&lt;ref name="EC2015" /&gt;

==FOI provisions under the law==

The '''Law on Free Access to Information''' stresses the obligation of the institutions to provide information with precise deadlines: it allows individuals and legal entities to exercise their right of access to public information and obliges the holders of information to provide information to the public.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt;

The public authorities subject to the law are governmental institutions and other bodies and institutions set by law, municipal bodies, public institutions and services, public enterprises and natural persons and legal entities performing a public service.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt; In general, all information available to the public authorities holding the information is public.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt; Access to them may be refused in exceptional cases determined by law.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt;

The holders of information are obliged to keep records and to update the list of information in their disposal and to publish them in a manner available to the public. Also, they are obliged to provide premises for inspection of the requested information.&lt;ref name=sep.gov&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sep.gov.mk/en/content/?id=93#.WKsLx2_hCUl |title=Free access to information |last= |first= |date= |website=Sep.gov.mk |publisher=Government of the Republic of Macedonia. Secretariat for European Affairs |access-date=20 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All institutions subject to the law are required to appoint officials for handling access to information requests. They are the reference point for the citizens willing to exercise their right to access public information.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt; The holder of the information is obliged to inform the public on the official person responsible for mediating information. The appointed person for mediating information shall provide the necessary information, help the applicant and keep special records for receipt of the applications for information.&lt;ref name=sep.gov/&gt;

Applicants can submit the requests in writing or orally. Reviewing the documents at the institution's building is free of charge. Costs of photocopying, transcribing, translating or delivering the documents can be charged to the applicant.&lt;ref name=BIRN&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf |publisher=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN)|issue= |access-date= 20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decision on the request should be made within 30 days.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; Access to information can be refused if it threatens national or public security; the economy; the environment; commercial or private legitimate interests; monetary and exchange policies; or if interferes with the prevention of criminal offences.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

The [[Commission for Protection of the Right to Free Access to Public Information]] (KOMSPI) is in charge for providing information to the citizens regarding access to information, monitoring the implementation of the  law and delivering regular annual reports on the application of the Law to the Parliament. Also, the Commission conducts seminars and trainings aiming at educating public officials in their duties to implement the access to public information law.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt; According to the 2015 [[European Commission]] Progress Report 2015 the Commission does not have sufficient capacity to monitor compliance with proactive disclosure of information, and has not the power to impose sanctions to better enforce the legislation.&lt;ref name=EC2015&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2015/20151110_report_the_former_yugoslav_republic_of_macedonia.pdf |title=The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Report 2015 |last= |first= |date=10 November 2015 |website=ec.europa.eu |publisher=European Commission |access-date=20 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The applicant has the right to appeal against a refusal. The first complaint is to the Commission for Protection of the Right to Free Access to Public Information; in case the applicant is not satisfied with the decision, he/she can launch a judicial review.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

Despite the good legal framework, the implementation of the Law on Free Access to Public Information remains ineffective.&lt;ref name=EC2015/&gt; Penalties are not imposed for failure to comply.&lt;ref name=EC2015/&gt; Political parties are excluded from the list of holders of information, thus they are outside the scope of the law.&lt;ref name=EC2015/&gt;

According to journalists, there is a tendency by public authorities to over-use the "classification" of documents to prevent public access to information.&lt;ref name=EC2015/&gt; According to [[Freedom House]], the law is unevenly and selectively enforced, with official denying responses and shunning independent or critical media outlets.&lt;ref name=FreedomHouse&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2013/11/belief-in-access-rights-found-low-in-macedonian-survey/ |title=Belief in Access Rights Found Low in Macedonian Survey |last= |first= |date=21 November 2013 |website=freedominfo.org |publisher=Freedominfo.org. The global network of freedom of information advocates|access-date=20 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To monitor and test the implementation of the law, in 2012 the [[MYLA|Macedonian Young Lawyers Association]] (MYLA) submitted 145 requests for free access to information of public interest to a number of state institutions. More than two thirds of the information holders responded within the legal time limit and delivered the requested information.&lt;ref name=EDRI&gt;{{cite web |url=https://edri.org/edrigramnumber10-16macedonia-acces-to-public-information-study |title=Macedonia: Serious channelges for access to public information |date=29 August 2012 |website=edri.org |publisher=European Digital Rights|access-date=20 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some problems of implementation and difficulties emerged, such as the practice of redirecting the requests towards other state institutions, instead of delivering it.&lt;ref name=EDRI/&gt;

According to a survey conducted in 2013 by the [[Open Society Foundations|Foundation Open Society]] - Macedonia, a significant share of Macedonian citizens does not believe they are entitled to have the right of access to public information and request informations of public interest.&lt;ref name=FreedomHouse/&gt; According to the survey, more than half of citizens had never heard and were unaware of the Law on Free Access to Public Information; only 13% of them were well knowledgeable about the Law.&lt;ref name=FreedomHouse/&gt;

'''Analogical modeling''' ('''AM''') is a formal theory of [[exemplar theory|exemplar]] based analogical reasoning, proposed by [[Royal Skousen]], professor of Linguistics and English language at [[Brigham Young University]] in [[Provo, Utah]]. It is applicable to language modeling and other categorization tasks. Analogical modeling is related to [[connectionism]] and [[Nearest neighbor (pattern recognition)|nearest neighbor]] approaches, in that it is data-based rather than abstraction-based; but it is distinguished by its ability to cope with imperfect datasets (such as caused by simulated short term memory limits) and to base predictions on all relevant segments of the dataset, whether near or far. In language modeling, AM has successfully predicted empirically valid forms for which no theoretical explanation was known (see the discussion of Finnish morphology in Skousen et al. 2002). &lt;!-- I don't have the book to hand; I know the article in question was pp. 11-25, but I can't give an actual page number for the Finnish prediction. --&gt;

==Implementation==
===Overview===
An exemplar-based model consists of a [[general-purpose modeling]] engine and a problem-specific dataset. Within the dataset, each exemplar (a case to be reasoned from, or an informative past experience) appears as a feature vector: a row of values for the set of parameters that define the problem. For example, in a spelling-to-sound task, the feature vector might consist of the letters of a word. &lt;!-- Re these tasks, it would be appropriate to cite one of the papers of Walter Daelemans or the Induction of Linguistic Knowledge group at Tilburg University. I need to slap the references up on the talk page so someone with a library can find the right one. --&gt; Each exemplar in the dataset is stored with an outcome, such as a phoneme or phone to be generated. When the model is presented with a novel situation (in the form of an outcome-less feature vector), the engine algorithmically sorts the dataset to find exemplars that helpfully resemble it, and selects one, whose outcome is the model's prediction. The particulars of the algorithm distinguish one exemplar-based modeling system from another.

In AM, we think of the feature values as characterizing a context, and the outcome as a behavior that occurs within that context. Accordingly, the novel situation is known as the ''given context.'' Given the known features of the context, the AM engine systematically generates all contexts that include it (all of its ''supracontexts''), and extracts from the dataset the exemplars that belong to each. The engine then discards those supracontexts whose outcomes are [[inconsistent]] (this measure of consistency will be discussed further below), leaving an ''analogical set'' of supracontexts, and probabilistically selects an exemplar from the analogical set with a bias toward those in large supracontexts. This multilevel search exponentially magnifies the likelihood of a behavior's being predicted as it occurs reliably in settings that specifically resemble the given context.

===Analogical modeling in detail===

AM performs the same process for each case it is asked to evaluate. The given context, consisting of n variables, is used as a template to generate &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; supracontexts. Each supracontext is a set of exemplars in which one or more variables have the same values that they do in the given context, and the other variables are ignored. In effect, each is a view of the data, created by filtering for some criteria of similarity to the given context, and the total set of supracontexts exhausts all such views. Alternatively, each supracontext is a theory of the task or a proposed rule whose predictive power needs to be evaluated.

It is important to note that the supracontexts are not equal peers one with another; they are arranged by their distance from the given context, forming a hierarchy. If a supracontext specifies all of the variables that another one does and more, it is a subcontext of that other one, and it lies closer to the given context. (The hierarchy is not strictly branching; each supracontext can itself be a subcontext of several others, and can have several subcontexts.) This hierarchy becomes significant in the next step of the algorithm.

The engine now chooses the analogical set from among the supracontexts. A supracontext may contain exemplars that only exhibit one behavior; it is deterministically homogeneous and is included. It is a view of the data that displays regularity, or a relevant theory that has never yet been disproven. A supracontext may exhibit several behaviors, but contain no exemplars that occur in any more specific supracontext (that is, in any of its subcontexts); in this case it is non-deterministically homogeneous and is included. Here there is no great evidence that a systematic behavior occurs, but also no counterargument. Finally, a supracontext may be heterogeneous, meaning that it exhibits behaviors that are found in a subcontext (closer to the given context), and also behaviors that are not. Where the ambiguous behavior of the nondeterministically homogeneous supracontext was accepted, this is rejected because the intervening subcontext demonstrates that there is a better theory to be found. The heterogeneous supracontext is therefore excluded. This guarantees that we see an increase in meaningfully consistent behavior in the analogical set as we approach the given context.

With the analogical set chosen, each appearance of an exemplar (for a given exemplar may appear in several of the analogical supracontexts) is given a pointer to every other appearance of an exemplar within its supracontexts. One of these pointers is then selected at random and followed, and the exemplar to which it points provides the outcome. This gives each supracontext an importance proportional to the square of its size, and makes each exemplar likely to be selected in direct proportion to the sum of the sizes of all analogically consistent supracontexts in which it appears. Then, of course, the probability of predicting a particular outcome is proportional to the summed probabilities of all the exemplars that support it.

(Skousen 2002, in Skousen et al. 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;11–25, and Skousen 2003, both passim)

===Formulas===
Given a context with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements:
:total number of pairings: &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;
:number of agreements for outcome ''i'': &lt;math&gt;n_i^2&lt;/math&gt;
:number of disagreements for outcome ''i'': &lt;math&gt;n_i(n - n_i)&lt;/math&gt;
:total number of agreements: &lt;math&gt;\sum{n_i^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:total number of disagreements: &lt;math&gt;\sum{n_i(n - n_i)} = n^2 - \sum{n_i^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Example===
This terminology is best understood through an example. In the example used in the second chapter of Skousen (1989), each context consists of three variables with potential values 0-3

:Variable 1: 0,1,2,3
:Variable 2: 0,1,2,3
:Variable 3: 0,1,2,3
The two outcomes for the dataset are ''e'' and ''r'', and the exemplars are:

 3 1 0 e
 0 3 2 r
 2 1 0 r
 2 1 2 r
 3 1 1 r

We define a network of pointers like so:

[[File:Analogical modeling pointer network.svg|300px|Pointer network for example problem]]

The solid lines represent pointers between exemplars with matching outcomes; the dotted lines represent pointers between exemplars with non-matching outcomes.

The statistics for this example are as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;n = 5&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n_r = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n_e = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:total number of pairings: &lt;math&gt;n^2 = 25&lt;/math&gt;
:number of agreements for outcome ''r'': &lt;math&gt;n_r^2 = 16&lt;/math&gt;
:number of agreements for outcome ''e'': &lt;math&gt;n_e^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:number of disagreements for outcome ''r'': &lt;math&gt;n_r(n - n_r) = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:number of disagreements for outcome ''e'': &lt;math&gt;n_e(n - n_e) = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:total number of agreements: &lt;math&gt;n_r^2 + n_e^2 = 17&lt;/math&gt;
:total number of disagreements: &lt;math&gt;n_r(n - n_r) + n_e(n - n_e) = n^2 - (n_r^2 + n_e^2) = 8&lt;/math&gt;
:''uncertainty'' or fraction of disagreement: &lt;math&gt;8/25 = .32&lt;/math&gt;

Behavior can only be predicted for a given context; in this example, let us predict the outcome for the context "3 1 2". To do this, we first find all of the contexts containing the given context; these contexts are called supracontexts. We find the supracontexts by systematically eliminating the variables in the given context; with ''m'' variables, there will generally be &lt;math&gt;2^m&lt;/math&gt; supracontexts. The following table lists each of the sub- and supracontexts; {{overline|x}} means "not x", and ''-'' means "anything".

|}
These contexts are shown in the venn diagram below:

[[File:Contexts venn diagramm for analogical modeling.svg|300px|Illustration of sub- and supracontexts]]

The next step is to determine which exemplars belong to which contexts in order to determine which of the contexts are homogeneous. The table below shows each of the subcontexts, their behavior in terms of the given exemplars, and the number of disagreements within the behavior:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! align="left" | Subcontext!! align="left" |Behavior!! align="left" |Disagreements
|-
| 3 1 2
| (empty)
| align="center" |0
|-
| 3 1 {{overline|2}}
| 3 1 0 e, 3 1 1 r
| align="center" |2
|-
| 3 {{overline|1}} 2
| (empty)
| align="center" |0
|-
| {{overline|3}} 1 2
| 2 1 2 r
| align="center" |0
|-
| 3 {{overline|1}} {{overline|2}}
| (empty)
| align="center" |0
|-
| {{overline|3}} 1 {{overline|2}}
| 2 1 0 r
| align="center" |0
|-
| {{overline|3}} {{overline|1}} 2
| 0 3 2 r
| align="center" |0
|-
| {{overline|3}} {{overline|1}} {{overline|2}}
| (empty)
| align="center" |0
|}

Analyzing the subcontexts in the table above, we see that there is only 1 subcontext with any disagreements: "3 1 {{overline|2}}", which in the dataset consists of "3 1 0 e" and "3 1 1 r". There are 2 disagreements in this subcontext; 1 pointing from each of the exemplars to the other (see the pointer network pictured above). Therefore, only supracontexts containing this subcontext will contain any disagreements. We use a simple rule to identify the homogeneous supracontexts:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the number if disagreements in the supracontext is greater than the number of disagreements in the contained subcontext, we say that it is heterogeneous; otherwise, it is homogeneous.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There are 3 situations that produce a homogeneous supracontext:
#The supracontext is empty. This is the case for "3 - 2", which contains no data points. There can be no increase in the number of disagreements, and the supracontext is trivially homogeneous.
#The supracontext is deterministic, meaning that only one type of outcome occurs in it. This is the case for "- 1 2" and "- - 2", which contain only data with the ''r'' outcome.
#Only one subcontext contains any data. The subcontext does not have to be deterministic for the supracontext to be homogeneous. For example, while the supracontexts "3 1 -" and "- 1 2" are deterministic and only contain one non-empty subcontext, "3 - -" contains only the subcontext "3 1 {{overline|2}}". This subcontext contains "3 1 0 e" and "3 1 1 r", making it non-deterministic. We say that this type of supracontext is unobstructed and non-deterministic.

The only two heterogeneous supracontexts are "- 1 -" and "- - -". In both of them, it is the combination of the non-deterministic "3 1 {{overline|2}}" with other subcontexts containing the ''r'' outcome which causes the heterogeneity.

There is actually a 4th type of homogeneous supracontext: it contains more than one non-empty subcontext and it is non-deterministic, but the frequency of outcomes in each sub-context is exactly the same. Analogical modeling does not consider this situation, however, for 2 reasons:
#Determining whether this 4 situation has occurred requires a &lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt; test. This is the only test of homogeneity that requires arithmetic, and ignoring it allows our tests of homogeneity to become statistically free, which makes AM better for modeling human reasoning.
#It is an extremely rare situation, and thus ignoring it will can be expected not to have a large effect on the predicted outcome.

Next we construct the analogical set, which consists of all of the pointers and outcomes from the homogeneous supracontexts.
The figure below shows the pointer network with the homogeneous contexts highlighted.

4 of the pointers in the analogical set are associated with the outcome ''e'', and the other 9 are associated with ''r''. In AM, a pointer is randomly selected and the outcome it points to is predicted. With a total of 13 pointers, the probability of the outcome ''e'' being predicted is 4/13 or 30.8%, and for outcome ''r'' it is 9/13 or 69.2%. We can create a more detailed account by listing the pointers for each of the occurrences in the homogeneous supracontexts:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:right"
|-
! cellpadding="1" | Occurrence!!Number of&lt;br/&gt;homogeneous&lt;br/&gt;supracontexts!!Number of&lt;br&gt;pointers!! align="center" |Analogical&lt;br/&gt;effect

We can then see the ''analogical effect'' of each of the instances in the data set.

==Historical context==
Analogy has been considered useful in describing language at least since the time of [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]. [[Noam Chomsky]] and others have more recently criticized analogy as too vague to really be useful (Bańko 1991), an appeal to a ''deus ex machina.'' Skousen's proposal appears to address that criticism by proposing an explicit mechanism for analogy, which can be tested for psychological validity.

==Applications==
Analogical modeling has been employed in experiments ranging from [[phonology]] and [[morphology (linguistics)]] to [[orthography]] and [[syntax]].

==Problems==
Though analogical modeling aims to create a model free from rules seen as contrived by linguists, in its current form it still requires researchers to select which variables to take into consideration. This is necessary because of the so-called "exponential explosion" of processing power requirements of the computer software used to implement analogical modeling. Recent research suggests that [[quantum computing]] could provide the solution to such performance bottlenecks (Skousen et al. 2002, see pp 45–47).

The [[Federal government of the United States]] requires [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) that receive federal anti-[[HIV/AIDS]] or anti-[[Human trafficking|trafficking]] funds to adopt an organization-wide policy opposing [[prostitution]] and [[Sex trafficking|sex-trafficking]]. This requirement, known as the '''anti-prostitution pledge''', has been in place since 2003.

The policy has been criticized as counterproductive, as it hampers enlisting those involved in the sex industry in the fight against AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supreme-court-says-law-cant-dictate-anti-aids-groups-speech/2013/06/20/1cf84846-d9bc-11e2-a9f2-42ee3912ae0e_story.html|title=Supreme Court says law can't dictate anti-AIDS groups' speech|date=20 June 2013|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the requirement was only applied to foreign-based NGOs, but in 2005 the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] began applying it to U.S.-based organizations as well, resulting in legal challenges on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds. These challenges were ultimately successful before the Supreme Court, with the 2013 decision in the case ''[[Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, Inc.|Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International]]''. The requirement remains in effect for foreign-based NGOs that receive U.S. funds.

==Legislation and implementation==
[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] announced the five-year $15 billion [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] in January 2003; [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed it in May 2003 under the name "United States Leadership against HIV/AIDS, [[Tuberculosis]], and [[Malaria]] Act (Global AIDS Act)". The act identifies prostitution and sex trafficking as contributing to the spread of HIV and explicitly advances a new U.S. policy goal: the eradication of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ025.108.pdf US Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 HR 1298]. 22 U.S.C. §§ 7601-7682. 108th Congress. Retrieved 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
The act states:
* "No funds ... may be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking."
* "No funds ... may be used to provide assistance to any group or organization that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking."
* nothing in the anti-prostitution clause "shall be construed to preclude" services to prostitutes, including testing, care and prevention services, including condoms.

In December 2003 Congress passed the [[Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act]] which provided for funding of anti-trafficking activities, subject to the following restrictions.
* "No funds ... may be used to promote, support, or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution."
* "No funds ... may be used to implement any program ... through any organization that has not stated in either a grant application, a grant agreement, or both, that it does not promote, support, or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060216135913/http://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/61130.htm Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003], 22 U.S.C. §§ 7101-7110 (2003). Retrieved 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-prostitution pledge language in both acts was authored by Representative [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=nation/&gt;

The [[Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004]] amended the AIDS Authorization to exempt the [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]], the [[World Health Organization]], the [[International AIDS Vaccine Initiative]] and any [[United Nations]] agency from having to sign the anti-prostitution pledge.&lt;ref name=aa/&gt;

While the language of the legislation does not distinguish between foreign and U.S.-based organizations, the pledge was initially only enforced for the former, as the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] had expressed First Amendment concerns.&lt;ref name=wp&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/17/AR2005051701247.html U.S. Backs Off Stipulation on AIDS Funds], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 18 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://brennan.3cdn.net/46e14203736808de8b_66m6iyhy8.pdf Letter from Justice Department to Judiciary Committee] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808195530/http://brennan.3cdn.net/46e14203736808de8b_66m6iyhy8.pdf |date=8 August 2009 }}, 24 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2004, a letter from Assistant Attorney General [[Daniel Levin (attorney)|Daniel Levin]] reversed this opinion,&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; and the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] issued a directive in June 2005 that expanded the pledge requirement to all NGOs.&lt;ref name=aa&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/business/business_opportunities/cib/pdf/aapd05_04.pdf Implementation of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 – Eligibility Limitation on the Use of Funds and Opposition to Prostitution and Sex Trafficking.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910012240/http://www.usaid.gov/business/business_opportunities/cib/pdf/aapd05_04.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}, (9 June 2005). Retrieved 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A document issued by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] in May 2005 sought to extend the pledge requirement to the large group of organizations that receive funding through the multilateral [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] (to which the U.S. contributes). This was quickly overturned by US Director of Foreign Assistance [[Randall L. Tobias]].&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

==Rationale and reactions==
In a February 2002 [[presidential directive|National Security Presidential Directive]], President George W. Bush wrote: "The United States opposes prostitution and any related activities, including pimping, pandering, and/or maintaining brothels as contributing to the phenomenon
of trafficking in persons. These activities are inherently harmful and dehumanizing. The United States Government's position is that these activities should not be regulated as a legitimate form of work for any human being."&lt;ref&gt;NSPD-22, 25 February 2002. Quoted in [http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/crim/part_2.pdf An Administration Priority] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021095527/http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/crim/part_2.pdf |date=21 October 2008 }}, U.S. Dept. of Justice&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, a group of non-profit organizations including [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]], the [[International Rescue Committee]], [[Save the Children]] and the [[International Center for Research on Women]] protested the anti-prostitution pledge policy in a letter to US Director of Foreign Assistance [[Randall L. Tobias]].&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; This was followed by a May 2005 protest letter to President Bush, signed by hundreds of organizations worldwide, stating that the pledge "makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to establish the trust necessary to provide services to these hard-to-reach groups" and it will "exacerbate stigma and discrimination against already marginalized groups."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genderhealth.org/pubs/20050518LTR.pdf Letter to President Bush], 18 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

This was countered in August 2005 by a letter to the President supporting the policy, signed by over 100 groups, including the [[Christian Medical and Dental Associations|Christian Medical Association]], [[Concerned Women for America]], [[Family Research Council]], [[Focus on the Family]], [[National Association of Evangelicals]], [[Southern Baptist Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission]], [[Sex Industry Survivors]], [[The Medical Institute]], [[The Salvation Army]], [[World Hope International]] and [[World Relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/28834.php|title=Over 100 Groups Urge Bush to Enforce Anti-Prostitution Policy to Aid Sexually Exploited Women and Children|work=Medical News TODAY|date=8 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the pledge requirement argued that prostitution is inherently harmful and needs to be abolished, rejected [[harm reduction]] approaches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/595392355.html|title=Christian Medical Association Lauds Anti-Prostitution Pledge Ruling|work=Christian News Wire|date=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held that legalized prostitution increases demand for sex trafficking.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

In May 2005, the [[Brazil]]ian government turned down $40 million in anti-HIV/AIDS funding from the U.S. government because of the anti-prostitution pledge. Brazil's AIDS commissioner Pedro Chequer was quoted as saying "Sex workers are part of implementing our AIDS policy and deciding how to promote it. They are our partners. How could we ask prostitutes to take a position against themselves?"&lt;ref name=nation&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050530/kaplan|title=Just Say Não|journal=The Nation|date=12 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-prostitution pledge has been criticized as counterproductive, because projects that work with and support prostitutes are often seen as instrumental in fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS. The Brazilian anti-AIDS program, which employs prostitutes to hand out information and free condoms, is considered by the United Nations to be the most successful in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/01/AR2006030102316.html|title=Where Prostitutes Also Fight AIDS|newspaper=Washington Post|date=2 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sonagachi]] Project is a prostitutes' cooperative in [[Calcutta]], [[India]], that supports [[sex workers' rights]] and works to stop the spread of HIV; it has received strong positive evaluations from both [[UNAIDS]] and the [[World Bank]], and has been cited by UNAIDS as a "best-practice" model of working with prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genderhealth.org/pubs/ProstitutionOathImplications.pdf Implications of U.S. Policy Restrictions for Programs Aimed at Commercial Sex Workers and Victims of Trafficking Worldwide], Center for Health and Gender Equity, November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Weitzer]] has described the anti-prostitution pledge as a symptom of what he calls the "[[moral panic|moral crusade]]" against sex trafficking, resulting in a broad attack against all forms of commercial sex acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weitzer |first1=Ronald |year=2007 |title=The Social Construction of Sex Trafficking: Ideology and Institutionalization of a Moral Crusade |url=http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/The%20social%20construction%20of%20sex%20trafficking%20Weitzer%20Pol%20Soc%202007%20%2035(3)%20%20447-475.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Politics &amp; Society |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=447–475 |doi=10.1177/0032329207304319 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628043556/http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/The%20social%20construction%20of%20sex%20trafficking%20Weitzer%20Pol%20Soc%202007%20%2035%283%29%20%20447-475.pdf |archivedate=28 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the policy juxtaposes the words "prostitution" and "sex trafficking"; it has been pointed out that it is important to clearly distinguish between these two concepts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2803%2913596-9/fulltext|author=Butcher K.|title=Confusion between prostitution and sex trafficking|journal=[[The Lancet]]|volume=361|pages=329–332|year=2003|pmid=12801757|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13596-9|issue=9373}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that all relevant organizations already strongly oppose sex trafficking.&lt;ref name=pm&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=4|issue=7|pages=e207 EP –|last=Masenior|first=Nicole Franck|author2=Chris Beyrer|title=The US Anti-Prostitution Pledge: First Amendment Challenges and Public Health Priorities|journal=PLoS Medicine|date=1 July 2007|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040207|pmid=17676943|pmc=1925124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Randall L. Tobias]], the U.S. administration's foreign aid chief who was responsible for implementation of the anti-prostitution pledge, resigned in April 2007 over allegations that he had used an [[escort service]]. Some sex worker organizations and commentators called the situation "ironic" and Tobias "hypocritical".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2007/05/02/prostitution_pledge/index.html The Anti-Prostitution Pledge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219100932/http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2007/05/02/prostitution_pledge/index.html |date=19 December 2008 }}, ''[[Salon.com]]'', 2 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/04/29/ex_aids_chief_in_escort_flap_called_hypocritical/ Ex-AIDS chief in escort flap called hypocritical], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', 29 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 final report of [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]]'s Global Commission on HIV and the Law denounced the anti-prostitution pledge and included the recommendation
{{quote|text=3.2.8 Repeal punitive conditions in official development assistance—such as the United States government's PEPFAR anti-prostitution pledge and its current anti-trafficking regulations—that inhibit sex workers' access to HIV services or their ability to form organisations in their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Global Commission on HIV and the Law|title=Final Report|url=http://www.hivlawcommission.org/resources/report/FinalReport-Risks,Rights&amp;Health-EN.pdf|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Lawsuits===
In response to the 2005 decision to apply the policy also to U.S.-based organizations, two lawsuits were filed, alleging that the policy compels or prohibits speech in violation of the First Amendment, and also prohibits actions that are exclusively privately funded.

In the first case (''DKT v. USAID''), the non-profit [[DKT International]] prevailed in [[United States district court|District Court]] but lost on appeal, at the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit]]. The February 2007 appeals court ruling was based on the assumption that the government would allow speech regarding prostitution as long as it is done through an affiliate that doesn't receive federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals (2007 February 27) District of Columbia Circuit Decision in [http://brennancenter.org/dynamic/subpages/download_file_47995.pdf DKT v. USAID No. 05-CV-01604] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517062512/http://brennancenter.org/dynamic/subpages/download_file_47995.pdf |date=17 May 2008 }}. Retrieved 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The second case (''AOSI v. USAID'') involved the plaintiffs [[Alliance for Open Society International]], its affiliate the [[Open Society Institute]], and [[Pathfinder International]]. In May 2006, a District Court in New York issued a [[preliminary injunction]], preventing the government from requiring these organizations to sign the anti-prostitution pledge. The government appealed this injunction to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court]]. During the oral arguments in the case, the government stated that it would allow legally and physically separate affiliates to engage in the prohibited speech.&lt;ref name=pm/&gt; The government issued guidelines to this effect in July 2007. In November 2007, the Appeals Court rebuffed the government and let the preliminary injunction stand, returning the case to the District Court. [[Global Health Council]] and [[InterAction]] joined the case, and the District Court extended the injunction to all U.S.-based members of these organizations in August 2008. The Appeals Court, in a 2-1 decision in July 2011, affirmed the injunction and held that the anti-prostitution policy requirement "likely violates the First Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/aosi_v_usaid  ''AOSI v. USAID'' resources], [[Brennan Center for Justice]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20110713031758/http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/11e51f0b-8781-4661-b383-d5d3dc77096b/2/doc/08-4917_complete_opn.pdf Alliance for Open Society International v. U.S. Agency for International Development], Appeals Court decision, 6 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the [[Brennan Center for Justice]] obtained a ruling forcing the Department of Justice's [[Office of Legal Counsel]] to hand over the original February 2004 memorandum which had argued that the pledge, as applied to U.S.-based organizations, was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. must show anti-prostitution pledge memo for HIV groups: court|date=19 September 2012|work=Thomson Reuters News and Insight|url=http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/2012/09_-_September/U_S__must_show_anti-prostitution_pledge_memo_for_HIV_groups__court/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 6-2 decision, the Supreme Court [[Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, Inc.|ruled]] in 2013 that the anti-prostitution pledge violated the First Amendment: the government may not leverage funding to regulate grant recipient's speech outside of the funded program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agency for Int'l Dev. v.

{{History of Bangladesh}}

The Bengali '''Language Movement''' ({{lang-bn|ভাষা আন্দোলন}} ''Bhasha Andolôn'') was a political movement in former [[East Bengal]] &lt;!-- Please note that East Bengal was the administrative division of the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] corresponding to today's Bangladesh from 1947 to 1955 --&gt; (currently [[Bangladesh]]) advocating the recognition of the [[Bengali language]] as an [[official language]] of the then-[[Dominion of Pakistan]] in order to allow its use in government affairs, the continuation of its use as a medium of education, its use in media, currency and stamps, and to maintain its writing in the [[Bengali script]].

When the Dominion of Pakistan was formed by the [[partition of India]] in 1947, it was composed of various ethnic and linguistic groups, with the geographically non-contiguous East Bengal province (that was [[One Unit|renamed]] in 1956 as [[East Pakistan]]) having a mainly [[Bengali people|Bengali]] population. In 1948, the [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Government of the Dominion of Pakistan]] ordained [[Urdu]] as the sole national language, sparking extensive protests among the Bengali-speaking majority of East Bengal. Facing rising sectarian tensions and mass discontent with the new law, the government outlawed public meetings and rallies. The students of the [[University of Dhaka]] and other political activists defied the law and organised a protest on 21 February 1952. The movement reached its climax when police killed student demonstrators on that day. The deaths provoked widespread civil unrest. After years of conflict, the central government relented and granted official status to the Bengali language in 1956.

The Language Movement catalysed the assertion of Bengali national identity in East Bengal and later East Pakistan, and became a forerunner to Bengali nationalist movements, including the [[6 Point Movement|6-Point Movement]] and subsequently the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. In Bangladesh, 21 February (''Ekushey February'') is observed as [[Language Movement Day]], a national holiday. The [[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka|Shaheed Minar]] monument was constructed near Dhaka Medical College in memory of the movement and its victims. In 1999, [[UNESCO]] declared 21 February as [[International Mother Language Day]],&lt;ref&gt;Glassie, Henry and Mahmud, Feroz.2008.Living Traditions. Cultural Survey of Bangladesh Series-II. Asiatic Society of Bangladesh. Dhaka. International Mother Language Day&lt;/ref&gt;  in tribute to the Language Movement and the ethno-linguistic rights of people around the world.

==Background==
The current nations, Pakistan and Bangladesh, were part of an undivided India during the British colonial rule. From the mid-19th century, the [[Urdu]] language had been promoted as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of [[Islam in India|Indian Muslims]] by political and religious leaders, such as [[Khwaja Salimullah|Sir Khwaja Salimullah]], [[Sir Syed Ahmed Khan]], [[Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk]] and [[Maulvi Abdul Haq]].&lt;ref name="urducontrov"&gt;{{cite web

While the use of Urdu grew common with Muslims in northern India, the Muslims of [[Bengal]] (a province in the eastern part of British Indian sub-continent) primarily used the Bengali language.

As early as the late 19th century, social activists such as the [[Islamic feminism|Muslim feminist]] [[Roquia Sakhawat Hussain]] were choosing to write in Bengali to reach out to the people and develop it as a modern literary language.  Supporters of Bengali opposed Urdu even before the [[partition of India]], when delegates from Bengal rejected the idea of making Urdu the lingua franca of Muslim India in the 1937 [[Lucknow]] session of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]. The Muslim League was a [[British India]]n political party that became the driving force behind the creation of [[Pakistan]] as a [[Muslim]] state separate from British India.&lt;ref name="tariqcontrov"&gt;{{cite journal

==Early stages of the movement==
[[Image:Partition of India.PNG|thumb|Britain's holdings on the [[Indian subcontinent]] were granted independence in 1947 and 1948, becoming four new independent states: the [[Dominion of India]], the [[Post-independence Burma, 1948–1962|Union of Burma]] (now Myanmar), [[Dominion of Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]), the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] (now part of India), and the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] (including [[East Bengal]], from 1956 [[East Pakistan]], 1971-today [[Bangladesh]]).]]

After the partition of India in 1947, Bengali-speaking people in [[East Bengal]], the non-contiguous eastern part of the [[Dominion of Pakistan]], made up 44 million of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan's 69 million people.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"&gt;{{cite book |last=Al Helal |first=Bashir |year=2012 |chapter=Language Movement |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Language_Movement |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307033428/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Language_Movement |archivedate=7 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominion of Pakistan's government, civil services, and military, however, were dominated by personnel from the western wing of the Dominion of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="JSToldenburg"&gt;{{cite journal

Students from Dhaka rallied under the leadership of [[Principal Abul Kashem|Abul Kashem]], the secretary of [[Tamaddun Majlish]], a Bengali Islamic cultural organisation. The meeting stipulated Bengali as an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan and as a medium of education in East Bengal.&lt;ref name="umarharv1"&gt;{{Harv|Umar|1979|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Pakistan Public Service Commission]] removed Bengali from the list of approved subjects, as well as from currency notes and stamps. The central education minister Fazlur Rahman made extensive preparations to make Urdu the only state language of the Dominion of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=227–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public outrage spread, and many Bengali students met on the University of Dhaka campus on 8 December 1947 to formally demand that Bengali be made an official language. To promote their cause, Bengali students organised processions and rallies in Dhaka.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;

Leading Bengali scholars argued why Urdu should not be the only state language. The writer [[Abul Mansur Ahmed]] said if Urdu became the state language, the educated society of East Bengal would become 'illiterate' and 'ineligible' for government positions.&lt;ref name="umarharvmansur"&gt;{{Harv|Umar|1979|pp=30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Rastrabhasa Sangram Parishad]] (National Language Action Committee), an organisation in favour of Bengali as a state language was formed towards the end of December 1947. Professor [[Nurul Huq Bhuiyan]] of the Tamaddun Majlish  convened the committee.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sri"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ekusher Shongkolon '80|year=1980 |publisher=[[Bangla Academy]] |location=Dhaka |language=bn |pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Parliament member [[Shamsul Huq]] convened a new committee to push for Bengali as a state language. Assembly member [[Dhirendranath Datta]] proposed legislation in the [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan]] to allow members to speak in Bengali and authorise its use for official purposes.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt; Datta's proposal was supported by legislators Prem Hari Burman, [[Bhupendra Kumar Datta]] and Sris Chandra Chattaopadhyaya of East Bengal, as well as the people from the region.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt; Prime minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] and the Muslim League denounced the proposal as an attempt to divide the Pakistani people, thus the legislation was defeated.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="swadhinotajuddho"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rahman |first=Hasan Hafizur |title=Bangladesher Swadhinotajuddher Dolilpotro|year=1982 |month= |publisher=Ministry of Information, People's Republic of Bangladesh |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agitations of 1948===
[[File:Quaid-delivering-speech copy2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] on 21 March 1948 told at a public meeting that ''State language of Pakistan is going to be Urdu and no other language.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://jinnah.pk/2009/09/27/national-consolidation/# |title=NATIONAL CONSOLIDATION |access-date=21 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521104719/http://jinnah.pk/2009/09/27/national-consolidation/# |archive-date=21 May 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Students of the [[University of Dhaka]] and other colleges of the city organised a general strike on 11 March 1948 to protest the omission of Bengali language from official use, including coins, stamps and recruitment tests for the navy. The movement restated the demand that Bengali be declared an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan. Political leaders such as Shamsul Huq, [[Shawkat Ali]], [[M Sirajul Islam]], [[Kazi Golam Mahboob]], [[Oli Ahad]], Abdul Wahed and others were arrested during the rallies. Rally leader [[Mohammad Toaha]] was hospitalised after attempting to snatch a rifle from a police officer. Student leaders, including [[Abdul Matin (language activist)|Abdul Matin]] and [[Abdul Malek Ukil]] took part in the procession.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"/&gt;

In the afternoon of 11 March, a meeting was held to protest police brutality and arrests. A group of students marching towards the chief minister [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]]'s house was stopped in front of the [[Dhaka High Court]]. The rally changed its direction and moved in the direction of the Secretariat building. Police attacked the procession injuring several students and leaders, including [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]].&lt;ref name="helal263"&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=263–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing strikes were observed the following four days. Under such circumstances, the chief minister Nazimuddin signed an accord with the student leaders agreeing to some terms and conditions, without complying to the demand that Bengali be made a state language.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;

In the height of civic unrest, [[Governor-General of Pakistan]] [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] arrived in Dhaka on 19 March 1948. On 21 March, at a civic reception at [[Suhrawardy Udyan|Racecourse Ground]], he claimed that the language issue was designed by a "[[fifth column]]" to divide Pakistani Muslims.&lt;ref name="choudhury"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:1952 Bengali Language movement.jpg|thumb|Procession march held on 21 February 1952 in [[Dhaka]]]]
The Urdu-Bengali controversy was reignited when Jinnah's successor, governor-general [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]], staunchly defended the "Urdu-only" policy in a speech on 27 January 1952.&lt;ref name="helal263" /&gt; On 31 January, the ''[[Shorbodolio Kendrio Rashtrobhasha Kormi Porishod]]'' (All-Party Central Language Action Committee) was formed in a meeting at the Bar Library Hall of the University of Dhaka, chaired by [[Maulana Bhashani]].&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Umar|2004|pp=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central government's proposal of writing the Bengali language in [[Arabic script]] was vehemently opposed at the meeting. The action committee called for an all out protest on 21 February, including strikes and rallies.&lt;ref name="helal263" /&gt; In an attempt to prevent the demonstration, the government imposed [[Section 144]] in Dhaka, thereby banning any gathering.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"/&gt;

===21 February===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Meeting at Amtala on Ekushey February.JPG|thumb|Meeting on the University of Dhaka premises on 21 February 1952]] --&gt;
At nine o'clock in the morning, students began gathering on the University of Dhaka premises in defiance of Section 144. The university vice-chancellor and other officials were present as armed police surrounded the campus. By a quarter past eleven, students gathered at the university gate and attempted to break the police line. Police fired [[tear gas]] shells towards the gate to warn the students.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt; A section of students ran into the Dhaka Medical College while others rallied towards the university premises cordoned by the police. The vice-chancellor asked police to stop firing and ordered the students to leave the area. However, the police arrested several students for violating section 144 as they attempted to leave. Enraged by the arrests, the students met around the [[East Bengal Legislative Assembly]] and blocked the legislators' way, asking them to present their insistence at the assembly. When a group of students sought to storm into the building, police opened fire and killed a number of students, including [[Abdus Salam (language martyr)|Abdus Salam]], [[Rafiq Uddin Ahmed]], [[Abul Barkat]] and [[Abdul Jabbar (activist)|Abdul Jabbar]].&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Shops, offices and public transport were shut down and a general strike began.&lt;ref name="UStudies" /&gt; At the assembly, six legislators including [[Manoranjan Dhar]], Boshontokumar Das, Shamsuddin Ahmed and [[Dhirendranath Datta]] requested that chief minister [[Nurul Amin]] visit wounded students in hospital and that the assembly be adjourned as a sign of mourning.&lt;ref name="bashir377393"&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=377–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; This motion was supported by some treasury bench members including [[Maulana Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish]], Shorfuddin Ahmed, Shamsuddin Ahmed Khondokar and Mosihuddin Ahmed.&lt;ref name="bashir377393" /&gt; However, Nurul Amin refused the requests.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bashir377393" /&gt;

===22 February===
Disorder spread across the province as large processions ignored [[section 144]] and condemned the actions of the police.&lt;ref name="helal263" /&gt; More than 30,000 people congregated at Curzon Hall in Dhaka. During the continued protests, police actions led to the death of four more people. This prompted officers and clerks from different organisations, including colleges, banks and the radio station, to boycott offices and join the procession.&lt;ref name="UStudies" /&gt; Protesters burned the offices of two leading pro-government news agencies, the ''Jubilee Press'' and the ''Morning News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Events after 1952==
[[Image:21feb1956 Shaheed Minar Dhaka.jpg|right|thumb|Foundation of the Shaheed Minar laid down in Dhaka by Abul Barkat's family members.]]
The ''Shorbodolio Kendrio Rashtrobhasha Kormi Porishod'', with support from the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami Muslim League]], decided to commemorate 21 February as ''Shohid Dibosh'' . On the first anniversary of the protests, people across East Bengal wore black badges in solidarity with the victims. Most offices, banks and educational institutions were closed to observe the occasion. Student groups made agreements with college and police officials to preserve law and order. More than 100,000 people assembled at a public meeting held in Dhaka, where community leaders called for the immediate release of Maulana Bhashani and other political prisoners.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt; However, West Pakistani politicians such as Fazlur Rahman aggravated sectional tensions by declaring that anyone who wanted Bengali to become an official language would be considered an "enemy of the state". Bengali students and civilians disobeyed the restrictions to celebrate the anniversary of the protests. Demonstrations broke out on the night of 21 February 1954 with various halls of the University of Dhaka raising black flags in mourning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=604–609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Front in 1954===
Political tensions came to a head as elections to the provincial assembly of East Bengal were held in 1954. The ruling Muslim League denounced the opposition [[United Front (East Pakistan)|United Front]] coalition, which—led by [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]] and the Awami League—wanted greater provincial autonomy. Several United Front leaders and activists were arrested.&lt;ref name="Helal601603"&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=600–603}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meeting of parliament's Muslim League members, chaired by prime minister [[Muhammad Ali Bogra]], resolved to give official recognition to Bengali. This decision was followed by a major wave of unrest as other ethnic groups sought recognition of other regional languages. Proponents of Urdu such as [[Maulvi Abdul Haq]] condemned any proposal to grant official status to Bengali. He led a rally of 100,000 people to protest against the Muslim League's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The United Front ministry ordered the creation of the [[Bangla Academy]] to promote, develop, and preserve Bengali language, literature, and heritage.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia2"&gt;{{cite book |last= Al Helal |first=Bashir|year=2012 |chapter=Bangla Academy |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Academy |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the United Front rule was temporary, as [[Governor General of Pakistan|Governor General]] [[Malik Ghulam Muhammad|Ghulam Muhammad]] cancelled the government and started Governor's rule on 30 May 1954.&lt;ref name="Helal601603" /&gt; The United Front again formed the ministry on 6 June 1955 after the governor's regime ended. The Awami League did not participate in this ministry though.&lt;ref name="bashir608613"&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=608–613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the return of the United Front to power, the anniversary on 21 February 1956 was observed for the first time in a peaceful atmosphere. The Government supported a major project to construct a new Shaheed Minar. The session of the constituent assembly was stopped for five minutes to express condolence for the students slain in the police shootings. Major rallies were organised by Bengali leaders and all public offices and businesses remained closed.&lt;ref name="bashir608613" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Constitutional reform===
On 7 May 1954, the constituent assembly resolved, with the Muslim League's support, to grant official status to Bengali.&lt;ref name="Pakspace" /&gt; Bengali was recognised as the second official language of Pakistan on 29 February 1956, and article 214(1) of the constitution of Pakistan was reworded to "The state language of Pakistan shall be Urdu and Bengali."

However, the military government formed by [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] made attempts to re-establish Urdu as the sole national language. On 6 January 1959, the military regime issued an official statement and reinstated the official stance of supporting the 1956 constitution's policy of two state languages.&lt;ref name="lambert"&gt;{{cite journal

===Assam===
Outside East Bengal, movement for equal status of Bengali also took place in the Indian state of [[Assam]]. On 19 May 1961, 11 Bengalis were killed in police firing in [[Silchar]] Railway Station, Assam, while demanding state recognition of Bengali language. Subsequently, Bengali was given co-official status in the three Bengali-majority districts of Assam.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sarkar |first=Gautam |date=20 May 2008 |title=Court route for language status |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080520/jsp/jharkhand/story_9294570.jsp |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=Calcutta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shaheed Minar 1963.png|thumb|The second Shaheed Minar (martyrs' monument) completed in 1963]]
Although the question of official languages was settled by 1956, the military regime of Ayub Khan promoted the interests of [[West Pakistan]] at the expense of [[East Pakistan]]. Despite forming the majority of the national population, the East Pakistani population continued to be under-represented in the civil and military services, and received a minority of state funding and other government help. This was mainly due to lack of [[democracy|representative government]] in the fledgling state. Mainly due to regional economic imbalances sectional divisions grew, and support for the Bengali ethnic nationalist Awami League,&lt;ref name="uddin" /&gt; which invoked the [[Six point movement|6-point movement]] for greater provincial autonomy. One demand was that East Pakistan be called ''Bangladesh'' (Land/Country of Bengal), which subsequently led to the Bangladesh Liberation War.&lt;ref name="B2g" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JSToldenburg" /&gt;

===Bangladesh===
[[File:International Mother Language Day Celebration.PNG|thumb|right|[[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka|Shaheed Minar]], or the Martyr's monument, located near [[Dhaka Medical College]] commemorates those who lost their life during the protests on 21 February 1952]]
The Language Movement had a major cultural impact on Bengali society. It has inspired the development and celebration of the Bengali language, literature and culture. 21 February, celebrated as Language Movement Day or ''Shohid Dibosh'' (Martyrs' Day), is a major national holiday in Bangladesh. A month-long event called the [[Ekushey Book Fair]] is held every year to commemorate the movement. ''[[Ekushey Padak]]'', one of the highest civilian awards in Bangladesh, is awarded annually in memory of the sacrifices of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Khan |first=Sanjida |year=2012 |chapter=National Awards |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=National_Awards |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Songs such as [[Abdul Gaffar Choudhury]]'s ''[[Ekusher Gaan]]'', set to music by Shaheed [[Altaf Mahmud]], as well as plays, works of art and poetry played a considerable role in rousing the people's emotions during the movement.&lt;ref name="cultureimp"&gt;{{cite book |last=Aminzade |first=Ronald |authorlink= |author2=Douglas McAdam |author3=Charles Tilly |date=17 September 2001 |chapter=Emotions and Contentious Politics |title=Silence and Voice in the Study of Contentious Politics |url=https://books.google.com/?id=h8PNEOZRRt8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bangladesh+language+movement |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |page=42 |isbn=0-521-00155-2 |accessdate=2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the events of February 1952, poems, songs, novels, plays, films, cartoons and paintings were created to capture the movement from varied point of views. Notable artistic depictions include the poems ''Bornomala, Amar Dukhini Bornomala'' and ''February 1969'' by [[Shamsur Rahman (poet)|Shamsur Rahman]], the film ''[[Jibon Theke Neya]]'' by [[Zahir Raihan]], the stage play ''Kobor'' by [[Munier Chowdhury]] and the novels ''Ekushey February'' by Raihan and ''Artonaad'' by [[Shawkat Osman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Islam |first=Rafiqul |title=Amar Ekushey O Shaheed Minar|year=2000 |publisher=Poroma |location=Dhaka |language=bn |isbn=984-8245-39-1 |pages=62–85  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after the first monument was destroyed by the police, a new ''[[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka|Shaheed Minar]]'' (Monument of Martyrs) was constructed in 1954 to commemorate the protesters who lost their lives. Work on a larger monument designed by the architect [[Hamidur Rahman (artist)|Hamidur Rahman]] began in 1957 with the support of the United Front ministry. Hamidur Rahman's model consisted of a large complex in the yard of the Dhaka Medical College Hostel. The design included a half-circular column  symbolizing a mother with her martyred sons standing at the dais in the centre of the monument. Although the imposition of martial law in 1958 interrupted the work, the monument was completed and inaugurated on 21 February 1963 by [[Abul Barkat]]'s mother, Hasina Begum. Pakistani forces demolished the monument during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, but the Bangladeshi government reconstructed it in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Imam |first=Jahanara |authorlink=Jahanara Imam |title=Ekattorer Dingulee|year=1986 |publisher=Shondhani Prokashani |location=Dhaka |language=bn |isbn=984-480-000-5 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ekushey Television]], the first private terrestrial TV channel of Bangladesh was named after the Event of 21 February.

===India===

The states of [[West Bengal]] and [[Tripura]] in [[India]] also follow and celebrate the Day by paying tribute to the unsung heroes. Moreover, all the bengalees in India and abroad celebrate the Day for the sacrifice of lives just for the sake of the [[First language]].

===Worldwide===
Bangladesh officially sent a proposal to UNESCO to declare 21 February as [[International Mother Language Day]]. The proposal was supported unanimously at the 30th General Conference of UNESCO held on 17 November 1999.&lt;ref name="UN1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmo.gov.bd/21february/imld_back.htm|title=International Mother Language Day – Background and Adoption of the Resolution|work=Government of Bangladesh|accessdate = 2007-06-21| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070520205804/http://www.pmo.gov.bd/21february/imld_back.htm| archivedate=20 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:4-Stroke-Engine.gif|thumb|A four-stroke engine showing the stroke of the piston.]]
The static '''compression ratio''' of an [[internal combustion engine]] or [[external combustion engine]] is a value that represents the [[ratio]] of the volume of its [[combustion chamber]] from its largest capacity to its smallest capacity. It is a fundamental specification for many common combustion engines.

In a piston engine, it is the ratio between the volume of the [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] and combustion chamber when the [[piston]] is at the [[bottom dead center|bottom of its stroke]], and the volume of the combustion chamber when the piston is at the [[top dead center|top of its stroke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
  | last = Encyclopædia Britannica
  | title = Compression ratio
  | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/130313/compression-ratio
  | accessdate =2009-07-21 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a cylinder and its combustion chamber with the piston at the bottom of its stroke may contain 1000&amp;nbsp;cc of air (900 cc in the cylinder plus 100 cc in the combustion chamber). When the piston has moved up to the top of its stroke inside the cylinder, and the remaining volume inside the head or combustion chamber has been reduced to 100&amp;nbsp;cc, then the compression ratio would be proportionally described as 1000:100, or with fractional reduction, a 10:1 compression ratio.

A high compression ratio is desirable because it allows an engine to extract more mechanical energy from a given mass of [[air-fuel mixture]] due to its higher [[thermal efficiency]]. This occurs because internal combustion engines are [[heat engine]]s, and higher efficiency is created because higher compression ratios permit the same combustion temperature to be reached with less fuel, while giving a longer expansion cycle, creating more mechanical power output and lowering the exhaust temperature.  It may be more helpful to think of it as an "expansion ratio", since more expansion reduces the temperature of the exhaust gases, and therefore the energy wasted to the atmosphere.  Diesel engines actually have a higher peak combustion temperature than petrol engines, but the greater expansion means they reject less heat in their cooler exhaust.

Higher compression ratios will however make gasoline engines subject to [[engine knocking]] (also known as detonation) if lower octane-rated fuel is used. This can reduce efficiency or damage the engine if knock sensors are not present to modify the ignition timing.

On the other hand, [[Diesel engines]] operate on the principle of compression ignition, so that a fuel which resists [[autoignition]] will cause late ignition, which will also lead to engine knock.

==Formula==
Static compression ratio (&lt;math&gt;CR&lt;/math&gt;) is calculated by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;{CR} = \frac { V_d + V_c } {V_c}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:
:&lt;math&gt;V_d&lt;/math&gt; = displacement volume. This is the volume inside the cylinder displaced by the piston from the beginning of the compression stroke to the end of the stroke.
:&lt;math&gt;V_c&lt;/math&gt; = clearance volume. This is the volume of the space in the cylinder left at the end of the compression stroke.

&lt;math&gt;V_d&lt;/math&gt; can be estimated by the [[Cylinder#Volume|cylinder volume]] formula

:&lt;math&gt;V_d = \tfrac{\pi} {4} b^2 s&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; = [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] [[Bore (engine)|bore]] (diameter)
:&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; = [[piston]] [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]] length

Because of the complex shape of &lt;math&gt;V_c&lt;/math&gt; it is usually measured directly. This is often done by filling the cylinder with liquid and then measuring the volume of the used liquid.

==Typical compression ratios==

===Gasoline (petrol) engine===
The compression ratio in a [[gasoline]] (petrol)-powered engine will usually not be much higher than 10:1 due to potential [[engine knocking]] (detonation) and not lower than 6:1. Some production automotive engines built for high performance from 1955–1972, used [[Octane rating|high-octane]] [[Tetraethyllead|leaded gasoline]] or '5 star' to allow compression ratios as high as 13.0:1.

A technique used to prevent the onset of knock is the high "swirl" engine that forces the intake charge to adopt a fast circular rotation in the cylinder during compression that provides quicker and more complete combustion. It is possible to manufacture gasoline engines with compression ratios of over 11:1 that can use 87 (MON + RON)/2 ([[octane rating]]) fuel with the addition of variable valve timing and knock sensors to delay ignition timing. Such engines may not produce their full rated power using 87 octane gasoline under all circumstances, due to the delayed ignition timing. [[Fuel Injection#Direct injection|Direct fuel injection]], which can inject fuel only at the time of fuel ignition (similar to a diesel engine), is another recent development which also allows for higher compression ratios on gasoline engines.

The compression ratio can be as high as 14:1 (2014 [[Ferrari 458 Speciale]]) in engines with a [[Engine knocking|'ping' or 'knock']] [[sensor]] and an [[electronic control unit]]. In 1981, Jaguar released a cylinder head that allowed up to 14:1 compression; but settled for 12.5:1 in production cars. The cylinder head design was known as the "May Fireball" head; it was developed by a Swiss engineer [[Michael May (racing driver)|Michael May]].

In 2012, [[Mazda]] released new petrol engines under the brand name [[SkyActiv]] with a 14:1 compression ratio (U.S. models have a 13:1 compression ratio to allow for 87 AKI octane), to be used in all Mazda vehicles by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=gSiteLife.Recommend("ExternalResource","110429942"); Tweet |url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20110422/NEWYORK/110429942 |title=2012 Mazda 3 gets 40-mpg SkyActiv engine option; diesel expected in 2014 |publisher=Autoweek |date=2011-04-22 |accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-20015698-48.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312043501/http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-20015698-48.html|date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=August 2010 |first=DAVE |last=VANDERWERP |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/mazda-engine-news-mazda-sky-gas-and-diesel-details-car-and-driver |title=Mazda Engine News: Mazda Sky Gas and Diesel Details |work=Car and Driver |accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petrol/gasoline engine with pressure-charging===
In a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] or [[Supercharger|supercharged]] gasoline engine, the CR is customarily built at 10.5:1 or lower. This is due to the turbocharger/supercharger already having compressed the air before it enters the cylinders. Port fuel injected engines typically run lower boost than direct fuel injected engines because port [[fuel injection]] allows the air/fuel mixture to be heated together which leads to detonation. Conversely, directly injected engines can run higher boost because heated air will not detonate without a fuel being present. In this instance fuel is injected as late as 60 degrees before [[top dead center]] to avoid heating the mixture to the point of compression ignition.

===Petrol/gasoline engine for racing===
Motorcycle racing engines can use compression ratios as high as 14.7:1, and it is common to find motorcycles with compression ratios above 12.0:1 designed for 86 or 87 octane fuel. F1 engines come closer to 17:1, which is critical for maximizing volumetric/fuel efficiency at around 18,000 RPM.{{citation needed|reason=no source found for quoted compression ratio|date=February 2016}}

===Ethanol and methanol engines===

Ethanol and methanol can take significantly higher compression ratios than gasoline. Racing engines burning [[methanol]] and [[ethanol fuel]] often incorporate a CR of 14.5-16:1.

===Gas-fueled engine===
The CR may be higher in engines running exclusively on [[Autogas|LPG]] or [[compressed natural gas|CNG]], due to the higher octane rating of these fuels.

===Diesel engine===
There is no spark plug in an auto-ignition [[diesel engine]]; the [[heat of compression]] raises the temperature of the air in the cylinder sufficiently to ignite the diesel when this is injected into the cylinder; after the compression stroke. The CR will customarily exceed 14:1 and ratios over 22:1 are common. The appropriate compression ratio depends on the design of the cylinder head. The figure is usually between 14:1 and 23:1 for direct injection engines, and between 18:1 and 23:1 for [[indirect injection]].And also in crdi injection.

===Kerosene engine===
A compression ratio of 6.5 or lower is desired for operation on [[kerosene]]. The [[petrol-paraffin engine]] version of the [[Ferguson TE20]] tractor had a compression ratio of 4.5:1 for operation on [[tractor vaporising oil]] with an [[octane rating]] between 55 and 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tractorbits.com/infofiles/TVO.asp |title=Tractor Vaporising Oil |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-04-18 |accessdate=2014-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012012756/http://tractorbits.com/infofiles/TVO.asp |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fault finding and diagnosis==
Measuring the compression [[pressure]] of an engine, with a [[pressure gauge]] connected to the [[spark plug]] opening, gives an indication of the engine's state and quality. There is, however, no formula to calculate compression ratio based on cylinder pressure.

If the nominal compression ratio of an engine is given, the pre-ignition cylinder pressure can be estimated using the following relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;p = p_0 \times \text{CR}^\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_0\;&lt;/math&gt; is the cylinder pressure at bottom dead center which is usually at 1 atm, &lt;math&gt;\text{CR}&lt;/math&gt; is the compression ratio, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma\;&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat ratio]] for the working fluid, which is about 1.4 for air, and 1.3 for methane-air mixture.

For example, if an engine running on gasoline has a compression ratio of 10:1, the cylinder pressure at top dead center is

:&lt;math&gt; p_\text{TDC} = 1 \text{ bar} \times 10^{1.4} = 25.1 \text{ bar}&lt;/math&gt;

This figure, however, will also depend on cam (i.e. valve) timing. Generally, cylinder pressure for common automotive designs should at least equal 10 [[bar (unit)|bar]], or, roughly estimated in [[pounds per square inch]] (psi) as between 15 and 20 times the compression ratio, or in this case between 150 psi and 200 psi, depending on cam timing. Purpose-built racing engines, stationary engines etc. will return figures outside this range.

Factors including late intake valve closure (relatively speaking for camshaft profiles outside of typical production-car range, but not necessarily into the realm of competition engines) can produce a misleadingly low figure from this test. Excessive [[connecting rod]] clearance, combined with extremely high [[oil pump (internal combustion engine)|oil pump]] output (rare but not impossible) can sling enough oil to coat the cylinder walls with sufficient oil to facilitate reasonable [[piston ring]] sealing.  In engines with compromised ring seals, this can artificially give a misleadingly high compression figure.

This phenomenon can actually be used to some slight advantage. If a compression test does give a low figure, and it has been determined it is not due to intake valve closure/camshaft characteristics, then one can differentiate between the cause being valve/seat seal issues and ring seal by squirting engine oil into the spark plug orifice, in a quantity sufficient to disperse across the piston crown and the circumference of the top ring land, and thereby affect the mentioned seal. If a second compression test is performed shortly thereafter, and the new reading is much higher, it would be the ring seal that is problematic, whereas if the compression test pressure observed remains low, it is a valve sealing (or more rarely head gasket, or breakthrough piston or, rarer still, cylinder-wall damage) issue.

If there is a significant (greater than 10%) difference between cylinders, that may be an indication that [[poppet valve|valves]] or [[cylinder head]] [[gasket]]s are leaking, [[piston]] rings are worn, or that the [[cylinder block|block]] is cracked.

If a problem is suspected, then a more comprehensive test using a [[leak-down tester]] can locate the leak.

==Variable Compression Ratio (VCR) engines==
Because cylinder-bore diameter, piston-stroke length and combustion-chamber volume are almost always constant, the compression ratio for a given engine is almost always constant, until engine wear takes its toll.

One exception is the [[experiment]]al [[Saab Variable Compression engine]] (SVC). This engine, designed by [[Saab Automobile]], uses a technique that dynamically alters the volume of the combustion chamber (V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;), which, via the above equation, changes the compression ratio (CR).

The [[Atkinson cycle]] engine was one of the first attempts at [[Variable compression ratio|variable compression]].  Since the compression ratio is the ratio between dynamic and static volumes of the combustion chamber, the Atkinson cycle's method of increasing the length of the power stroke compared to the intake stroke ultimately altered the compression ratio at different stages of the cycle.

On August 15, 2016 Nissan Motor Company announced a new variable compression engine that can choose an optimal compression ratio variably between 8:1 and 14:1. That lets the engine adjust moment by moment to torque demands, always maintaining top efficiency. Nissan says that the turbo-charged, 2-liter, four-cylinder VC-T engine averages 27 percent better fuel economy than the 3.5-liter V6 engine it replaces, with comparable power and torque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/infiniti-vc-t-variable-compression-ratio-engine/44893/|title=Turbo power meets extreme efficiency: Infiniti unveils world's first production engine with variable compression ratios|last=Blain|first=Loz|date=|website=newatlas.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012075110/https://newatlas.com/infiniti-vc-t-variable-compression-ratio-engine/44893/|archive-date=2017-10-12|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dynamic compression ratio==
The calculated compression ratio, as given above, presumes that the cylinder is sealed at the bottom of the stroke, and that the volume compressed is the actual volume.

However: intake valve closure (sealing the cylinder) always takes place after BDC, which may cause some of the intake charge to be compressed backwards out of the cylinder by the rising piston at very low speeds; only the percentage of the stroke after intake valve closure is compressed. Intake port tuning and scavenging may allow a greater mass of charge (at a higher than atmospheric pressure) to be trapped in the cylinder than the static volume would suggest ( This "corrected" compression ratio is commonly called the "''dynamic compression ratio''".

This ratio is higher with more conservative (i.e., earlier, soon after BDC) intake cam timing, and lower with more radical (i.e., later, long after BDC) intake cam timing, but always lower than the static or "nominal" compression ratio.

The actual position of the piston can be determined by trigonometry, using the stroke length and the [[connecting rod]] length (measured between centers). The absolute cylinder pressure is the result of an exponent of the dynamic compression ratio. This exponent is a polytropic value for the ratio of variable heats for air and similar gases at the temperatures present. This compensates for the temperature rise caused by compression, as well as heat lost to the cylinder. Under ideal (adiabatic) conditions, the exponent would be 1.4, but a lower value, generally between 1.2 and 1.3 is used, since the amount of heat lost will vary among engines based on design, size and materials used, but provides useful results for purposes of comparison. For example, if the static compression ratio is 10:1, and the dynamic compression ratio is 7.5:1, a useful value for cylinder pressure would be (7.5)^1.3 × atmospheric pressure, or 13.7 [[bar (unit)|bar]]. (× 14.7 psi at sea level = 201.8 psi. The pressure shown on a gauge would be the absolute pressure less atmospheric pressure, or 187.1 psi.)

The two corrections for dynamic compression ratio affect cylinder pressure in opposite directions, but not in equal strength. An engine with high static compression ratio and late intake valve closure will have a DCR similar to an engine with lower compression but earlier intake valve closure.

Additionally, the cylinder pressure developed when an engine is running will be higher than that shown in a compression test for several reasons.

*The much higher velocity of a piston when an engine is running versus cranking allows less time for pressure to bleed past the piston rings into the crankcase.
*a running engine is coating the cylinder walls with much more oil than an engine that is being cranked at low RPM, which helps the seal.
*the higher temperature of the cylinder will create higher pressures when running vs. a static test, even a test performed with the engine near [[operating temperature]].
* A running engine does not stop taking air &amp; fuel into the cylinder when the piston reaches BDC; The mixture that is rushing into the cylinder during the downstroke develops momentum and continues briefly after the vacuum ceases (in the same respect that rapidly opening a door will create a draft that continues after movement of the door ceases).  This is called scavenging.  Intake tuning, cylinder head design, valve timing and exhaust tuning determine how effectively an engine scavenges.

==Compression ratio versus overall pressure ratio==
[[File:Compression ratio versus pressure ratio.png|thumb|Compression ratio versus pressure ratio]]

Compression ratio and [[overall pressure ratio]] are interrelated as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Compression ratio
|| 2:1  || 3:1 || 5:1 || 10:1 || 15:1 || 20:1 || 25:1 || 35:1
|-
! Pressure ratio
|| 2.64:1 || 4.66:1 ||9.52:1 || 25.12:1 || 44.31:1 || 66.29:1 || 90.60:1 || 145:1
|}

The reason for this difference is that compression ratio is defined via the volume reduction:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{CR}=\frac{V_1}{V_2}&lt;/math&gt;,
while pressure ratio is defined as the [[pressure]] increase:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{PR}=\frac{P_2}{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;.
In calculating the pressure ratio, we assume that an [[adiabatic compression]] is carried out (i.e. that no heat energy is supplied to the gas being compressed, and that any temperature rise is solely due to the compression). We also assume that air is a perfect gas. With these two assumptions, we can define the relationship between change of volume and change of pressure as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;P_1 V_1^\gamma = P_2 V_2^\gamma \Rightarrow
\frac{P_2}{P_1}= \left( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \right)^\gamma &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[ratio of specific heats]] (air: approximately 1.4).
The values in the table above are derived using this formula. Note that in reality the ratio of specific heats changes with temperature and that significant deviations from adiabatic behavior will occur.

'''Conflict analysis''' or '''conflict assessment''' is an initial stage of [[conflict resolution]] in which parties seek to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics in their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/conflict_assessment/ Conflict Assessment], Beyond Intractability.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in Darfur, conflict analysis of the [[Fur-Arab War]] in 1987 noted that: &lt;blockquote&gt;from time immemorial, seasonal fluctuations in water and grazing land had led to conflict over natural resources in Darfur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyesondarfur.org/conflict.html Conflict Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Social Network Diagram (segment).svg|thumb|290x290px]]
When there is a disagreement in the methods used to achieve an end result, and there is a disparity between a unified vision and direction, opposing sides are subject to conflict. If these sides consistently misinterpret one another, a problematic situation can spiral out of control rapidly. Conflicts are not always linear in nature. Members of multiple organizational levels with varying statuses can all partake in conflict. When undergoing analysis, it is integral to understand the reasons that spark such disagreement to effectively reach its [[Conflict resolution|resolution]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of conflict analysis and resolution|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0203893166|edition=1st|location=London|page=339|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D.

There are also various subsets of conflict analysis such as environmental conflict analysis, which deal with specific types of disputes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/research/ceca/ Environmental Conflict Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; In certain occasions a [[conflict atlas]] is used to show graphically the analysis of the conflict. The prefixes macro- and micro- are used in conjunctions with conflicts to denote the scale of the conflict, macro referring to a larger scale conflict and micro referring to a conflicting situation on a smaller scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schellenberg|first1=James A.|title=Conflict resolution : theory, research, and practice|date=1996|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=0791431029|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts can arise at different levels, from intrapersonal to interpersonal issues as well as between two individuals or between two countries as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bercovitch|first1=Jacob|last2=Jackson|first2=Richard|title=International conflict : a chronological encyclopedia of conflicts and their management 1945-1995|date=1997|publisher=Congressional Quarterly|location=Washington, DC|isbn=156802195X|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome dictates how we refer to a given conflict.

== Identity ==

Celia Cook-Hoffman defines 'Identity' as "how individuals and collectives see and understand themselves in a conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D. Sandole ... [et al.] ; foreword by Dean G.|title=Handbook of conflict analysis and resolution|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-203-89316-6|pages=19|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identity plays a vital role in a conflicting situation. How the opponent perceives their competition dictates how they will move forward with the conflict. Conversely, the opponent is also aware of how they are perceived and understands they are obligated to maintain their reputation throughout the conflict. This can give rise to defensive tactics as well as to [[Revenge|retaliation]]. In this aspect, identity is not unlike reputation. Identities are a [[social construct]], and once cemented, are almost impossible to alter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D. Sandole ...

== Gender ==

Snyder writes that women are seen as "victims" of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D. Sandole ... [et al.] ; foreword by Dean G.|title=Handbook of conflict analysis and resolution|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-203-89316-6|pages=45|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender proves to be significant in the analysis of conflicts. Women are likely to be perceived as individuals who have no control of a conflict. Snyder also notes that women are "considered legitimate targets and make up 90 percent of all casualties." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The majority of refugees are also females. In conflicts such as war, widows are forced to become the new head of the household, assuming all the responsibilities that their husband would normally do so. Also, When contemplating a resolution of a conflict, the lack of inclusion of women from an issues inception to execution has an effect on post-conflict analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D.

== Causation ==

Rothbart notes that factors that spark international conflict are "struggles between beliefs, behaviors, and environmental conditions as they are as they should be" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D. Sandole ...

It is said that major conflicts can arise from underlying historical disagreements that bubble over periodically. It is also found that the aggressor's identity plays a role in causation of a conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D. Sandole ... [et al.] ; foreword by Dean G.|title=Handbook of conflict analysis and resolution|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-203-89316-6|pages=59–67|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Victims ==

In times of war Korostelina writes that "non-combatants suffer most" &lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D. Sandole ... [et al.] ; foreword by Dean G.|title=Handbook of conflict analysis and resolution|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-203-89316-6|pages=85|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; because they are nothing but victims of any conflict. More innocent civilian blood is shed than any other conflict-related party. Korostelina also adds that civilians "are war's survivors or its collateral damage &lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt; accentuating the fact that prisoners of war are likely to be the individuals who suffer most during any conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D.

== Mediation ==
Bercovitch notes that there are several methods to conflict mediation. Bercovitch lists these methods as "negotiation, inquiry, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlements, and resorts to regional agencies and arrangements." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=edited by Dennis J.D.

{{God| expanded=representations}}

In the [[Platonism|Platonic]], [[Neopythagorean]], [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonic]], and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] schools of philosophy, the '''demiurge''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|m|i|ˌ|ɜr|dʒ}}) is an [[artisan]]-like figure responsible for fashioning and maintaining the physical universe. The [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] adopted the term "demiurge". Although a fashioner, the demiurge is not necessarily the same as the creator figure in the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] sense, because the demiurge itself and the material from which the demiurge fashions the universe are both considered to be consequences of something else. Depending on the system, they may be considered to be either uncreated and eternal or the product of some other entity.

The word "demiurge" is an English word derived from ''demiurgus'', a [[List of Latinised names|Latinized]] form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|δημιουργός}} or ''dēmiourgos''. It was originally a common noun meaning "craftsman" or "artisan", but gradually came to mean "producer", and eventually "creator". The philosophical usage and the proper noun derive from [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Plato's ''Timaeus'']], written {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;360 BC, where the demiurge is presented as the creator of the universe. The demiurge is also described as a creator in the Platonic ({{circa}}&amp;nbsp;310–90 BC) and Middle Platonic ({{circa}}&amp;nbsp;90 BC – AD 300) philosophical traditions. In the various branches of the Neoplatonic school (third century onwards), the demiurge is the fashioner of the real, perceptible world after the model of the [[Theory of Forms|&lt;!-- capitalized--&gt;Ideas]], but (in most Neoplatonic systems) is still not itself "[[Form of the Good|the One]]". In the arch-[[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]] ideology of the various Gnostic systems, the material universe is evil, while the non-material world is good. According to some strains of Gnosticism, the demiurge is [[Evil|malevolent]], as it is linked to the material world. In others, including the teaching of [[Valentinianism|Valentinus]], the demiurge is simply ignorant or misguided.

==Platonism and neoplatonism==
[[Plato]], as the speaker Timaeus, refers to the Demiurge frequently in the [[Socratic dialogue]] ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (28a [[wikt:ff.#Abbreviation|ff.]]), {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;360 BC. The main character refers to the Demiurge as the entity who "fashioned and shaped" the material world. Timaeus describes the Demiurge as unreservedly [[:wikt:benevolence|benevolent]], and so it desires a world as good as possible. The world remains imperfect, however, because the Demiurge created the world out of a [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaotic]], [[Indeterminacy (philosophy)|indeterminate]] non-being.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Plato's work ''Timaeus'' is a philosophical reconciliation of [[Hesiod]]'s cosmology in his ''[[Theogony]]'', [[syncretism|syncretically]] reconciling Hesiod to [[Homer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Python: A Study of Delphic Myth and Its Origin|year=1974|first=Joseph|last=Fontenrose|page=226|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h56ansk4SyQC&amp;pg=PA226 | isbn=978-0-8196-0285-5 | publisher=Biblo &amp; Tannen Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chorology: On Beginning in Plato's Timaeus|year=1999|first=John|last=Sallis|page=86|isbn=0-253-21308-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gS_9aQ5mYKgC&amp;pg=PA86 | publisher=Indiana University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The mythology of ancient Greece and Italy|first=Thomas|last=Keightley|year=1838|page=44|publisher=Oxford University|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lWAEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=theogony+timaeus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Platonism===
In [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]]'s [[Neo-Pythagorean]] and Middle Platonist [[cosmogony]], the Demiurge is second God as the ''[[nous]]'' or thought of intelligibles and sensibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans|last=Kahn|first=Charles|publisher=Hacket Publishing|year=|isbn=978-0-872205758|location=Indianapolis|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoplatonism===
[[Plotinus]] and the later Platonists worked to clarify the Demiurge. To Plotinus, the second [[emanation]] represents an uncreated second cause (see [[Pythagoras]]' [[Dyad (symbol)|Dyad]]). Plotinus sought to reconcile Aristotle's ''[[energeia]]'' with Plato's Demiurge,&lt;ref name="Karamanolis2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Karamanolis|first=George|year= 2006|title=Plato and Aristotle in Agreement?: Platonists on Aristotle from Antiochus to Porphyry|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-926456-2|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, as Demiurge and mind (''nous''), is a critical component in the [[ontological]] construct of human consciousness used to explain and clarify [[substance theory]] within [[Platonic realism]] (also called [[idealism]]). In order to reconcile Aristotelian with Platonian philosophy,&lt;ref name="Karamanolis2006" /&gt; Plotinus metaphorically identified the demiurge (or ''nous'') within the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon of the Greek Gods]] as [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;The ordering principle is twofold; there is a principle known as the Demiurge, and there is the Soul of the All; the appellation "Zeus" is sometimes applied to the Demiurge and sometimes to the principle conducting the universe.{{cn|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Henology====
The first and highest aspect of God is described by Plato as the One (Τὸ Ἕν, "To Hen"), the source, or the [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|Monad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dionysius the Areopagite and the Neoplatonist Tradition: Despoiling the Hellenes|last=Wear|first=Sarah|last2=Dillon|first2=John|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2013|isbn=9780754603856|location=Burlington, VT|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the God above the Demiurge, and manifests through the actions of the Demiurge. The Monad [[emanation|emanated]] the demiurge or ''[[Nous]]'' (consciousness) from its "indeterminate" vitality due to the monad being so abundant that it overflowed back onto itself, causing self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Neoplatonism and Gnosticism|year=1992|editor1-first=Richard T.|editor1-last=Wallis|editor2-first=Jay|editor2-last=Bregman|others=[[International Society for Neoplatonic Studies]]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WSbrLPup7wYC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Anti-Gnostic+Polemic+Francisco+Garcia+Bazan+translated+from+Spanish+by+Winifred+T.+Slater+Nous+as+a+%22Second+God%22+According+to+Plotinus+In+Enneads#PPA55,M1 |isbn=978-0-7914-1337-1 |publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This self-reflection of the indeterminate vitality was referred to by Plotinus as the "Demiurge" or creator. The second principle is organization in its reflection of the [[Sentience|nonsentient]] force or ''[[Potentiality and actuality|dynamis]]'', also called the one or the Monad. The dyad is ''energeia'' emanated by the one that is then the work, process or activity called ''nous'', Demiurge, mind, consciousness that organizes the indeterminate vitality into the experience called the material world, universe, cosmos. [[Plotinus]] also elucidates the equation of matter with nothing or non-being in ''[[The Enneads]]''&lt;ref&gt;"Matter is therefore a non-existent"; Plotinus, ''Ennead'' 2, Tractate 4 Section 16.&lt;/ref&gt; which more correctly is to express the concept of [[idealism]] or that there is not anything or anywhere outside of the "mind" or ''nous'' (c.f. [[pantheism]]).

Plotinus' form of [[Platonic idealism]] is to treat the Demiurge, ''nous'' as the contemplative faculty (''ergon'') within man which orders the force (''dynamis'') into conscious reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]] wrote of this Neoplatonist philosopher: "With Plotinus there even appears, probably for the first time in [[Western philosophy]], idealism that had long been current in the East even at that time, for it taught (Enneads, iii, lib. vii, c.10) that the soul has made the world by stepping from eternity into time, with the explanation: 'For there is for this universe no other place than the soul or mind' (''neque est alter hujus universi locus quam anima''), indeed the ideality of time is expressed in the words: 'We should not accept time outside the soul or mind' (''oportet autem nequaquam extra animam tempus accipere'')." (Parerga and Paralipomena, Volume I, "Fragments for the History of Philosophy", §&amp;nbsp;7) Similarly, Professor Ludwig Noiré wrote: "For the first time in Western philosophy we find idealism proper in Plotinus (Enneads, iii, 7, 10), where he says, 'The only space or place of the world is the soul', and 'Time must not be assumed to exist outside the soul'." [5] It is worth noting, however, that like Plato but unlike Schopenhauer and other modern philosophers, Plotinus does not worry about whether or how we can get beyond our ideas in order to know external objects.&lt;/ref&gt; In this, he claimed to reveal Plato's true meaning: a doctrine he learned from Platonic tradition that did not appear outside the academy or in Plato's text. This tradition of creator God as ''nous'' (the manifestation of consciousness), can be validated in the works of pre-Plotinus philosophers such as [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]], as well as a connection between Hebrew and Platonic cosmology (see also [[Philo]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Numenius of Apamea]] was reported to have asked, "What else is Plato than Moses speaking Greek?" Fr. 8 Des Places.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Demiurge of Neoplatonism is the ''Nous'' (mind of God), and is one of the three ordering principles:
* ''[[Arche]]'' (Gr. "beginning") – the source of all things,
* ''[[Logos]]'' (Gr. "reason/cause") – the underlying order that is hidden beneath appearances,
* ''[[:wikt:harmonia|Harmonia]]'' (Gr. "harmony") – numerical [[ratios]] in [[mathematics]].

Before Numenius of Apamea and Plotinus' ''[[Enneads]]'', no Platonic works ontologically clarified the Demiurge from the [[allegory]] in Plato's ''Timaeus''. The idea of Demiurge was, however, addressed before Plotinus in the works of Christian writer [[Justin Martyr]] who built his understanding of the Demiurge on the works of Numenius.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

====Iamblichus====
{{See also|Panentheism}}
Later, the Neoplatonist [[Iamblichus of Chalcis|Iamblichus]] changed the role of the "One", effectively altering the role of the Demiurge as second cause or dyad, which was one of the reasons that Iamblichus and his teacher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] came into conflict.

The figure of the Demiurge emerges in the theoretic of Iamblichus, which conjoins the transcendent, incommunicable “One,” or Source. Here, at the summit of this system, the Source and Demiurge (material realm) coexist via the process of ''[[henosis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.theandros.com/iamblichus.html Theurgy, Iamblichus and henosis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109100359/http://www.theandros.com/iamblichus.html |date=2010-01-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Iamblichus describes the One as a monad whose first principle or emanation is intellect (''nous''), while among "the many" that follow it there is a second, super-existent "One" that is the producer of intellect or soul (''psyche'').

The "One" is further separated into spheres of intelligence; the first and superior sphere is objects of thought, while the latter sphere is the domain of thought. Thus, a [[wikt:triad#Noun|triad]] is formed of the [[perception|intelligible]] ''nous'', the [[noesis|intellective]] ''nous'', and the ''[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]'' in order to reconcile further the various Hellenistic philosophical schools of [[Aristotle]]'s [[Actus et potentia|''actus'' and ''potentia'']] (actuality and potentiality) of the [[unmoved mover]] and Plato's Demiurge.

Then within this intellectual triad Iamblichus assigns the third rank to the Demiurge, identifying it with the perfect or Divine ''nous'' with the intellectual triad being promoted to a ''hebdomad'' (pure intellect).

In the theoretic of Plotinus, ''nous'' produces nature through intellectual mediation, thus the intellectualizing gods are followed by a triad of psychic gods.

==Gnosticism==
{{Split section |Yaldabaoth|discuss={{TALKPAGENAME}}#Split proposed |date=November 2018}}
{{gnosticism}}
[[Gnosticism]] presents a distinction between the highest, unknowable God and the demiurgic "creator" of the material. Several systems of Gnostic thought present the Demiurge as antagonistic to the will of the [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Supreme Being]]: his act of creation occurs in an unconscious semblance of the divine model, and thus is fundamentally flawed, or else is formed with the malevolent intention of entrapping aspects of the divine ''in'' materiality. Thus, in such systems, the Demiurge acts as a solution to (or, at least possibly, the problem or cause that gives rise to){{citation needed|date=March 2014}} the [[problem of evil]].

===Mythos===
One Gnostic [[mythos]] describes the declination of aspects of the divine into human form. [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] (Greek: Σοφία, lit. "wisdom"), the Demiurge's mother a partial aspect of the divine ''[[Pleroma]]'' or "Fullness," desired to create something apart from the [[Absolute (philosophy)|divine totality]], without the receipt of divine assent. In this act of separate creation, she gave birth to the monstrous Demiurge and, being ashamed of her deed, wrapped him in a cloud and created a throne for him within it. The Demiurge, isolated, did not behold his mother, nor anyone else, and concluded that only he existed, ignorant of the superior levels of reality.

The Demiurge, having received a portion of power from his mother, sets about a work of creation in unconscious imitation of the superior [[Pleroma|Pleromatic]] realm: He frames the [[seven heavens]], as well as all material and animal things, according to forms furnished by his mother; working however blindly, and ignorant even of the existence of the mother who is the source of all his energy. He is blind to all that is spiritual, but he is king over the other two provinces. The word ''dēmiourgos'' properly describes his relation to the material; he is the ''father'' of that which is animal like himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103105.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 5, 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus Sophia's power becomes enclosed within the material forms of humanity, themselves entrapped within the material universe: the goal of Gnostic movements was typically the awakening of this spark, which permitted a return by the subject to the superior, non-material realities which were its primal source.

===Angels===
[[Psalm 82]] begins ({{bibleref2|Psa|82:1|NET|verse 1}}), "God stands in the assembly of [[El (deity)|El]] (the [[Septuagint]] here says the assembly of gods), in the midst of the gods he renders judgment", indicating a plurality of gods, although it does not indicate that these gods were co-actors in creation. [[Philo]] had inferred from the expression "Let us make man" of the [[Book of Genesis]] that God had used other beings as assistants in the creation of man, and he explains in this way why man is capable of vice as well as virtue, ascribing the origin of the latter to God, of the former to His helpers in the work of creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{quote|It is on this account that Moses says, at the creation of man alone that God said, 'Let us make man,' which expression shows an assumption of other beings to himself as assistants, in order that God, the governor of all things, might have all the blameless intentions and actions of man, when he does right attributed to him; and that his other assistants might bear the imputation of his contrary actions.|{{cite web |title=Philo: On the Creation, XXIV |url=http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book1.html |website=www.earlyjewishwritings.com}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Gnostic sects ascribe the work of creation to angels, some of them using the same passage in Genesis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin Martyr]], ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. c. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; So [[Irenaeus]] tells&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 23, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; of the system of [[Simon Magus]],&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 23, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; of the system of [[Menander (gnostic)|Menander]],&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, i. 24, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; of the system of Saturninus, in which the number of these angels is reckoned as seven, and&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; of the system of [[Carpocrates]]. In the report of the system of [[Basilides]],&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 24, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; we are told that our world was made by the angels who occupy the lowest heaven; but special mention is made of their chief, who is said to have been the [[God in Judaism|God of the Jews]], to have led that people out of the land of [[Egypt]], and to have given them their law. The prophecies are ascribed not to the chief but to the other world-making angels.

The Latin translation, confirmed by [[Hippolytus of Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus, ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]''. vii. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; makes [[Irenaeus]] state that according to [[Cerinthus]] (who shows [[Ebionites|Ebionite]] influence), creation was made by a power quite separate from the Supreme God and ignorant of Him. [[Theodoret]],&lt;ref&gt;Theodoret, ''Haer. Fab''. ii. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; who here copies Irenaeus, turns this into the plural number "powers," and so [[Epiphanius of Salamis]]&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''[[Panarion]]'', 28.&lt;/ref&gt; represents Cerinthus as agreeing with Carpocrates in the doctrine that the world was made by angels.

===Yaldabaoth===
[[File:Lion-faced deity.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A lion-faced deity found on a Gnostic gem in [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]'s ''L'antiquité expliquée et représentée en figures'' may be a depiction of the Demiurge.]]

In the [[Ophites|Ophite]] and [[Sethians|Sethian]] systems, which have many affinities with the teachings of Valentinus, the making of the world is ascribed to a company of seven [[archon (Gnosticism)|archons]], whose names are given, but still more prominent is their chief, "Yaldabaoth" (also known as "Yaltabaoth" or "Ialdabaoth").

In the ''[[Apocryphon of John]]'' {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;AD 120–180, the demiurge arrogantly declares that he has made the world by himself:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now the [[archon]] ["ruler"] who is weak has three names. The first name is Yaltabaoth, the second is Saklas ["fool"], and the third is [[Samael]]. And he is impious in his arrogance which is in him. For he said, 'I am God and there is no other God beside me,' for he is ignorant of his strength, the place from which he had come.&lt;ref&gt;"Apocryphon of John," translation by Frederik Wisse in ''The Nag Hammadi Library''. Accessed online at [http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/apocjn.html gnosis.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He is Demiurge and maker of man, but as a ray of light from above enters the body of man and gives him a soul, Yaldabaoth is filled with envy; he tries to limit man's knowledge by forbidding him the fruit of knowledge in paradise. At the consummation of all things, all light will return to the [[Pleroma]]. But Yaldabaoth, the Demiurge, with the material world, will be cast into the lower depths.&lt;ref name="Catholic"&gt;{{Catholic|wstitle=Demiurge|inline=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yaldabaoth is frequently called "the Lion-faced", ''leontoeides'', and is said to have the body of a serpent. The demiurge is also&lt;ref&gt;Hipp. ''Ref''. vi. 32, p.&amp;nbsp;191.&lt;/ref&gt; described as having a fiery nature, applying the words of Moses to him: "the Lord our God is a burning and consuming fire". Hippolytus claims that Simon used a similar description.&lt;ref&gt;Hipp. ''Ref''. vi. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Pistis Sophia]]'', Yaldabaoth has already sunk from his high estate and resides in Chaos, where, with his forty-nine demons, he tortures wicked souls in boiling rivers of pitch, and with other punishments (pp.&amp;nbsp;257, 382). He is an archon with the face of a lion, half flame, and half darkness.

Under the name of ''Nebro'' (rebel), Yaldabaoth is called an angel in the [[apocryphal]] ''[[Gospel of Judas]]''. He is first mentioned in "The Cosmos, Chaos, and the Underworld" as one of the twelve angels to come "into being [to] rule over chaos and the [underworld]". He comes from heaven, and it is said his "face flashed with fire and [his] appearance was defiled with blood". Nebro creates six angels in addition to the angel [[Saklas]] to be his assistants. These six, in turn, create another twelve angels "with each one receiving a portion in the heavens".

====Names====
[[File:Leontocephaline-Ostia.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|right|Drawing of the ''leontocephaline'' found at the [[Mithraeum]] of C. Valerius Heracles and sons, dedicated 190 AD at [[Ostia Antica]], Italy (CIMRM 312).]]

The most probable derivation of the name "Yaldabaoth" was that given by [[Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler]]. Giesler believed the name was derived from the Aramaic ''yaldā bahuth'', {{lang|arc|ילדאבהות}}, meaning "Son of Chaos". However, [[Gilles Quispel]] notes:
{{quote|[[Gershom Scholem]], the third genius in this field, more specifically the genius of precision, has taught us that some of us were wrong when they believed that Jaldabaoth means "son of chaos", because the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''bahutha'' in the sense of chaos only existed in the imagination of the author of a well-known dictionary. This is a pity because this name would suit the demiurge risen from chaos to a nicety. And perhaps the author of the ''[[On the Origin of the World|Untitled Document]]'' did not know Aramaic and also supposed as we did once, that ''baoth'' had something to do with ''[[Tohu wa-bohu|tohuwabohu]]'', one of the few Hebrew words that everybody knows. ... It would seem then that the Orphic view of the demiurge was integrated into Jewish Gnosticism even before the redaction of the myth contained in the original ''[[Apocryphon of John]]''. ... [[Phanes]] is represented with the mask of a ''lion's'' head on his breast, while from his sides the heads of a ram and a buck are budding forth: his body is encircled by a snake. This type was accepted by the [[Mithraism|Mithras mysteries]], to indicate [[Aion (deity)|Aion]], the new year, and Mithras, whose numerical value is 365. Sometimes he is also identified with Jao Adonai, the creator of the Hebrews. His hieratic attitude indicates Egyptian origin. The same is true of [[Mithraism#Lion-headed figure|the monstrous figure with the head of a lion]], which symbolises Time, [[Chronos]], in Mithraism; Alexandrian origin of this type is probable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quispel|first=Gilles|authorlink=Gilles Quispel|page=64|title=Gnostica, Judaica, Catholica: Collected Essays of Gilles Quispel|editor1-first= Johannes|editor1-last=Van Oort|isbn=978-90-04-13945-9|year=2008|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|location=Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"[[Samael]]" literally means "Blind God" or "God of the Blind" in Hebrew ({{hebrew|סמאל}}). This being is considered not only blind, or ignorant of its own origins but may, in addition, be evil; its name is also found in [[Judaism]] as the [[Death (personification)#Death (angels) in religion|Angel of Death]] and in Christian [[demon]]ology. This link to Judeo-Christian tradition leads to a further comparison with [[Satan]]. Another alternative title for the demiurge is "Saklas", Aramaic for "fool".

The angelic name "[[Ariel (angel)|Ariel]]" (meaning "the lion of God" in Hebrew)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition|first=Gershom|last=Scholem|publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary of America|year=1965|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; has also been used to refer to the Demiurge and is called his "perfect" name;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert McLachlan Wilson|title=Nag Hammadi and gnosis: Papers read at the First International Congress of Coptology|year=1976|publisher=BRILL|pages=21–23|quote=''Therefore his esoteric name is Jaldabaoth, whereas the perfect call him Ariel, because he has the appearance of a lion.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; in some Gnostic lore, Ariel has been called an ancient or original name for Ialdabaoth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gustav Davidson|title=A dictionary of angels: including the fallen angels |year=1994 |publisher=Scrollhouse |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name has also been inscribed on amulets as "Ariel Ialdabaoth",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David M Gwynn|title=Religious Diversity in Late Antiquity |year=2010 |publisher=BRILL |page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Campbell Bonner |title=An Amulet of the Ophite Gnostics |year=1949 |publisher=The American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Hesperia Supplements, Vol. 8|pages=43–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the figure of the archon inscribed with "Aariel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gilles Quispel |author2=R. van den Broek |author-link2=Roel van den Broek |author3=Maarten Jozef Vermaseren |title=Studies in gnosticism and hellenistic religions|year=1981|publisher=BRILL|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marcion===
According to [[Marcion of Sinope|Marcion]], the title God was given to the Demiurge, who was to be sharply distinguished from the higher Good God. The former was ''díkaios,'' severely just, the latter ''agathós,'' or loving-kind; the former was the "god of this world" ({{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|4:4}}), the God of the [[Old Testament]], the latter the true God of the [[New Testament]]. Christ, though in reality the Son of the Good God, pretended to be the Messiah of the Demiurge, the better to spread the truth concerning His heavenly Father. The true believer in Christ entered into God's kingdom, the unbeliever remained forever the slave of the Demiurge.&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;

===Valentinus===
It is in the [[Valentinianism|system of Valentinus]] that the name ''Dēmiourgos'' is used, which occurs nowhere in Irenaeus except in connection with the Valentinian system; we may reasonably conclude that it was Valentinus who adopted from Platonism the use of this word. When it is employed by other Gnostics either it is not used in a technical sense, or its use has been borrowed from Valentinus. But it is only the name that can be said to be specially Valentinian; the personage intended by it corresponds more or less closely with the Yaldabaoth of the Ophites, the [[Abraxas|great Archon]] of Basilides, the Elohim of Justinus, etc.

The Valentinian theory elaborates that from Achamoth (''he kátō sophía'' or lower wisdom) three kinds of substance take their origin, the spiritual (''pneumatikoí''), the animal (''psychikoí'') and the material (''hylikoí''). The Demiurge belongs to the second kind, as he was the offspring of a union of Achamoth with matter.&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103105.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 5.]&lt;/ref&gt; And as Achamoth herself was only the daughter of ''Sophía'' the last of the thirty Aeons, the Demiurge was distant by many emanations from the Propatôr, or Supreme God.&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;

In creating this world out of Chaos the Demiurge was unconsciously influenced for good; and the universe, to the surprise even of its Maker, became almost perfect. The Demiurge regretted even its slight imperfection, and as he thought himself the Supreme God, he attempted to remedy this by sending a Messiah. To this Messiah, however, was actually united with Jesus the Saviour, Who redeemed men. These are either ''hylikoí'' or ''pneumatikoí''.&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;

The first, or material men, will return to the grossness of matter and finally be consumed by fire; the second, or animal men, together with the Demiurge, will enter a middle state, neither Pleroma nor ''hyle''; the purely spiritual men will be completely freed from the influence of the Demiurge and together with the Saviour and Achamoth, his spouse, will enter the Pleroma divested of body (''hyle'') and soul (''psyché'').&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103106.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 6.]&lt;/ref&gt; In this most common form of Gnosticism the Demiurge had an inferior though not intrinsically evil function in the universe as the head of the animal, or psychic world.&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;

===The devil===
Opinions on [[the devil]], and his relationship to the Demiurge, varied. The Ophites held that he and his demons constantly oppose and thwart the human race, as it was on their account the devil was cast down into this world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103130.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 30, 8.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to one variant of the Valentinian system, the Demiurge is also the maker, out of the appropriate substance, of an order of ''spiritual'' beings, the devil, the prince of this world, and his angels. But the devil, as being a ''spirit'' of wickedness, is able to recognise the higher spiritual world, of which his maker the Demiurge, who is only animal, has no real knowledge. The devil resides in this lower world, of which he is the prince, the Demiurge in the heavens; his mother Sophia in the middle region, above the heavens and below the Pleroma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103105.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 5, 4.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Valentinian [[Heracleon]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnosis.org/library/fragh.htm Heracleon, Frag. 20.]&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted the devil as the ''principle'' of evil, that of ''hyle'' (matter). As he writes in his commentary on {{bibleverse||John|4:21}},
&lt;blockquote&gt;The mountain represents the Devil, or his world, since the Devil was one part of the whole of matter, but the world is the total mountain of evil, a deserted dwelling place of beasts, to which all who lived before the law and all Gentiles render worship. But Jerusalem represents the creation or the Creator whom the Jews worship. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. You then who are spiritual should worship neither the creation nor the Craftsman, but the Father of Truth. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This vilification of the creator was held to be inimical to Christianity by the early fathers of the church. In refuting the beliefs of the gnostics, [[Irenaeus]] stated that "Plato is proved to be more religious than these men, for he allowed that the same God was both just and good, having power over all things, and himself executing judgment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103325.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', iii. 25.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cathars===
[[Catharism]] apparently inherited their idea of Satan as the creator of the evil world from Gnosticism. Quispel writes,

{{quote|There is a direct link between ancient Gnosticism and Catharism. The Cathars held that the creator of the world, Satanael, had usurped the name of God, but that he had subsequently been unmasked and told that he was not really God.&lt;ref&gt;Quispel, Gilles and Van Oort, Johannes (2008), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Neoplatonism and Gnosticism==
{{Wikisource|1=Enneads/Against the Gnostics; or, Against Those that Affirm the Creator of the Cosmos and the Cosmos Itself to be Evil|2=Against the Gnostics; or, Against Those that Affirm the Creator of the Cosmos and the Cosmos Itself to be Evil}}
{{Main|Neoplatonism and Gnosticism}}
Gnosticism attributed falsehood or evil to the concept of the Demiurge or creator, though in some Gnostic traditions the creator is from a fallen, ignorant, or lesser—rather than evil—perspective, such as that of [[Valentinius]].

===Plotinus===
The Neoplatonic philosopher [[Plotinus]] addressed within his works Gnosticism's conception of the Demiurge, which he saw as un-[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] and blasphemous to the Demiurge or creator of Plato. Plotinus is noted as the founder of [[Neoplatonism]] (along with his teacher [[Ammonius Saccas]]).&lt;ref&gt;John D. Turner. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140816004048/http://www.unl.edu/classics/faculty/turner/triadaft.htm Neoplatonism].&lt;/ref&gt; In the ninth [[tractate]] of the second of his ''Enneads'', Plotinus criticizes his opponents for their appropriation of ideas from Plato:

{{quote|From Plato come their punishments, their rivers of the underworld and the changing from body to body; as for the plurality they assert in the Intellectual Realm—the Authentic Existent, the Intellectual-Principle, ''the Second Creator and the Soul''—all this is taken over from the Timaeus.|Ennead 2.9.vi; emphasis added from [[A.H. Armstrong]]'s introduction to Ennead 2.9}}

Of note here is the remark concerning the second [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]] or Creator and third hypostasis or [[Anima mundi|World Soul]]. Plotinus criticizes his opponents for "all the novelties through which they seek to establish a philosophy of their own" which, he declares, "have been picked up outside of the truth";&lt;ref name="sacred-texts"&gt;"For, in sum, a part of their doctrine comes from Plato; all the novelties through which they seek to establish a philosophy of their own have been picked up outside of the truth." Plotinus "Against the Gnostics", [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/enn161.htm ''Ennead'' II, 9, 6.]&lt;/ref&gt; they attempt to conceal rather than admit their indebtedness to ancient philosophy, which they have corrupted by their extraneous and misguided embellishments. Thus their understanding of the Demiurge is similarly flawed in comparison to Plato’s original intentions.

Whereas Plato's Demiurge is good wishing good on his creation, Gnosticism contends that the Demiurge is not only the originator of evil but is evil as well. Hence the title of Plotinus' refutation: "Against Those That Affirm the Creator of the Kosmos and the Kosmos Itself to be Evil" (generally quoted as "Against the Gnostics"). Plotinus argues of the disconnect or great barrier that is created between the ''nous'' or mind's [[noumenon]] (see [[Heraclitus]]) and the material world ([[phenomenon]]) by believing the material world is evil.

The majority of scholars tend&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Plotinus: Enneads II|edition=Loeb Classical Library|author=Plotinus, Arthur Hilary Armstrong (trans.)|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1966|quote=From this point to the end of ch. 12 Plotinus is attacking a Gnostic myth known to us best at present in the form it took in the system of Valentinus. The Mother, Sophia-Achamoth, produced as a result of the complicated sequence of events which followed the fall of the higher Sophia, and her offspring the Demiurge, the inferier and ignorant maker of the material universe, are Valentinian figures; cp. Irenaeus, ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' 1.4 and 5. Valentinius had been in Rome, and there is nothing improbable in the presence of Valentinians there in the time of Plotinus. But the evidence in the ''Life'' ch. 16 suggests that the Gnostics in Plotinus's circle belonged rather to the older group called Sethians or [[Archontics]], related to the [[Ophites]] or [[Barbelo]]gnostics: they probably called themselves simply 'Gnostics.' Gnostic sects borrowed freely from each other, and it is likely that Valentinius took some of his ideas about Sophia from older Gnostic sources, and that his ideas in turn influenced other Gnostics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to understand Plotinus' opponents as being a Gnostic sect—certainly (specifically [[Sethianism|Sethian]]), several such groups were present in [[Alexandria]] and elsewhere about the [[Mediterranean]] during Plotinus' lifetime. Plotinus specifically points to the Gnostic doctrine of Sophia and her emission of the Demiurge.

Though the former understanding certainly enjoys the greatest popularity, the identification of Plotinus' opponents as Gnostic is not without some contention. Christos Evangeliou has contended&lt;ref&gt;Evangeliou, "Plotinus's Anti-Gnostic Polemic and Porphyry's Against the Christians", in Wallis &amp; Bregman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WSbrLPup7wYC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=Plotinus%27s+Anti-Gnostic+Polemic+and+Porphyry%27s+Against+the+Christians%22+Christos+Evangeliou&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rSBVKFe8VD&amp;sig=3MNVVSq8bDZs4koa-yMP6PaNT-Q&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jR4hTIK_AsP48AbV_shl&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Plotinus%27s%20Anti-Gnostic%20Polemic%20and%20Porphyry%27s%20Against%20the%20Christians%22%20Christos%20Evangeliou&amp;f=false p. 111.]&lt;/ref&gt; that Plotinus’ opponents might be better described as simply "Christian Gnostics", arguing that several of Plotinus’ criticisms are as applicable to orthodox Christian doctrine as well. Also, considering the evidence from the time, Evangeliou thought the definition of the term "Gnostics" was unclear. Of note here is that while Plotinus' student [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] names [[Christianity]] specifically in Porphyry's own works, and Plotinus is to have been a known associate of the Christian [[Origen]], none of Plotinus' works mention Christ or Christianity—whereas Plotinus specifically addresses his target in the ''Enneads'' as the Gnostics.

[[A.H. Armstrong]] identified the so-called "Gnostics" that Plotinus was attacking as Jewish and Pagan, in his introduction to the tract in his translation of the ''Enneads''. Armstrong alluding to Gnosticism being a Hellenic philosophical heresy of sorts, which later engaged Christianity and Neoplatonism.&lt;ref&gt;From "Introduction to Against the Gnostics", Plotinus' ''Enneads'' as translated by A.H. Armstrong, pp. 220–22: "The treatise as it stands in the Enneads is a most powerful protest on behalf of Hellenic philosophy against the un-Hellenic heresy (as it was from the Platonist as well as the orthodox Christian point of view) of Gnosticism. There were Gnostics among Plotinus's own friends, whom he had not succeeded in converting (Enneads ch. 10 of this treatise) and he and his pupils devoted considerable time and energy to anti-Gnostic controversy (Life of Plotinus ch. 16). He obviously considered Gnosticism an extremely dangerous influence, likely to pervert the minds even of members of his own circle. It is impossible to attempt to give an account of Gnosticism here. By far the best discussion of what the particular group of Gnostics Plotinus knew believed is M. Puech's admirable contribution to Entretiens Hardt V (Les Sources de Plotin). But it is important for the understanding of this treatise to be clear about the reasons why Plotinus disliked them so intensely and thought their influence so harmful."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, pp. 220–22: "Short statement of the doctrine of the three hypostasis, the One, Intellect and Soul; there cannot be more or fewer than these three. Criticism of the attempts to multiply the hypostasis, and especially of the idea of two intellects, one which thinks and that other which thinks that it thinks. (ch. 1). The true doctrine of Soul (ch. 2). The law of necessary procession and the eternity of the universe (ch.3). Attack on the Gnostic doctrine of the making of the universe by a fallen soul, and on their despising of the universe and the heavenly bodies (chs. 4–5). The senseless jargon of the Gnostics, their plagiarism from and perversion of Plato, and their insolent arrogance (ch. 6). The true doctrine about Universal Soul and the goodness of the universe which it forms and rules (chs. 7–8). Refutation of objections from the inequalities and injustices of human life (ch. 9). Ridiculous arrogance of the Gnostics who refuse to acknowledge the hierarchy of created gods and spirits and say that they alone are sons of God and superior to the heavens (ch. 9). The absurdities of the Gnostic doctrine of the fall of "Wisdom" (Sophia) and of the generation and activities of the Demiurge, maker of the visible universe (chs. 10–12). False and melodramatic Gnostic teaching about the cosmic spheres and their influence (ch. 13). The blasphemous falsity of the Gnostic claim to control the higher powers by magic and the absurdity of their claim to cure diseases by casting out demons (ch. 14). The false other-worldliness of the Gnostics leads to immorality (ch. 15). The true Platonic other-worldliness, which love and venerates the material universe in all its goodness and beauty as the most perfect possible image of the intelligible, contracted at length with the false, Gnostic, other-worldliness which hates and despises the material universe and its beauties (chs. 16–18)."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John D. Turner]], professor of religious studies at the University of Nebraska, and famed translator and editor of the [[Nag Hammadi library]], stated&lt;ref&gt;Turner, "Gnosticism and Platonism", in Wallis &amp; Bregman.&lt;/ref&gt; that the text Plotinus and his students read was Sethian Gnosticism, which predates Christianity. It appears that Plotinus attempted to clarify how the philosophers of the academy had not arrived at the same conclusions (such as [[dystheism]] or [[misotheism]] for the creator God as an answer to the [[problem of evil]]) as the targets of his criticism.

[[Emil Cioran]] also wrote his ''Le mauvais démiurge'' ("The Evil Demiurge"), published in 1969, influenced by Gnosticism and [[Schopenhauer]]ian interpretation of Platonic ontology, as well as that of Plotinus.

A '''devil''' is the [[personification]] of [[evil]] as it is conceived in many and various cultures and religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} pages 11 &amp; 34&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen as the objectification of a hostile and destructive force.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell. ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity’'. Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to specify a particular definition of any complexity that will cover all of the traditions, beyond that it is a manifestation of evil.  It is meaningful to consider the devil through the lens of each of the cultures and religions that have the devil as part of their mythos.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell. ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity’'. Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} p. 41-75&lt;/ref&gt; 

The history of this concept intertwines with theology, mythology, psychiatry, art and literature, maintaining a validity, and developing independently within each of the traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell.

Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 44 &amp; 51&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs historically in many contexts and cultures, and is given many different names — [[Satan]], [[Lucifer]], [[Beelzebub]], [[Mephistopheles]] — and attributes: It is portrayed as blue, black, or red; It is portrayed as having horns on its head, and without horns, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Arp, Robert.

== Etymology ==
The Modern English word ''[[:wikt:devil|devil]]'' derives from the [[Middle English]] ''[[wikt:devel|devel]]'', from [[Old English]] ''[[wikt:deofol|dēofol]]'', that in turn represents an early Germanic borrowing of [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:diabolus|diabolus]]''. This in turn was borrowed from {{lang-el|[[:wikt:διάβολος|διάβολος]]}} ''diábolos'', "slanderer",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddia%2Fbolos διάβολος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|el|διαβάλλειν}} ''diabállein'', "to slander" from [[wikt:διά|διά]] ''diá'', "across, through" and βάλλειν ''bállein'', "to hurl", probably akin to the [[Sanskrit]] ''gurate'', "he lifts up".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/devil|title=Definition of DEVIL|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
In his book ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity'' [[Jeffrey Burton Russell]] discusses various meanings, and difficulties that are encountered when using the term ''Devil''.  He doesn’t claim to define the word in a general sense, but he describes the limited use that he intends for the word in his book — limited in order to “minimize this difficulty” and “for the sake of clarity”. In this book Russel uses the word ''Devil'' as "the [[personification]] of [[evil]] found in a variety of cultures", as opposed the word "[[Satan]]", which he reserves specifically for the figure in the [[Abrahamic religions]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=D2-Na937xRYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Devil:+Perceptions+of+Evil+from+Antiquity+to+Primitive+Christianity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGsLKW1qneAhVEzoMKHYZ_DXMQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Devil%3A%20Perceptions%20of%20Evil%20from%20Antiquity%20to%20Primitive%20Christianity&amp;f=false The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity]'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} pages 11 &amp; 34&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introduction to his book, ''Satan: A Biography'', Henry Ansgar Kelly discusses various considerations and meanings that he has encountered in using terms such as ''devil'' and ''Satan'', etc. While not offering a general definition, he describes that in his book "whenever ''diabolos'' is used as the proper name of Satan", he signals it by using "small caps."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Henry Ansgar|date=2006|title=Satan: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gPIpQg0lRbMC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=intitle:satan+inauthor:kelly#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|location=Cambridge, England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521604024|pages=3–4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has a variety of definitions for the meaning of "devil", supported by a range of citations: "Devil" may refer to Satan, the supreme spirit of evil, or one of the Satan's emissaries or demons that populate Hell, or to one of the spirits that possess a demonic person; "devil" may refer to one of the "malignant deities" feared and worshiped by "heathen people", a demon, a malignant being of superhuman powers; figuratively “devil" may be applied to a wicked person, or playfully to a rogue or rascal, or in empathy often accompanied by the word “poor" to a person — "poor devil".&lt;ref&gt; Craige, W. A.; Onions, C. T. A. "Devil". ''A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles: Introduction, Supplement, and Bibliography''. Oxford: Clarendon Press. (1933) p. 283-284&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
The earliest Hindu texts do not offer further explanations for evil, regarding evil as something natural.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 56&lt;/ref&gt; However, later texts offer various explanations for evil. According to an explanation given by the [[Brahmin]]s, both [[demons]] and gods spoke truth and untruth, but the demons relinquished the truth and the gods relinquished the untruth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; But both [[spirits]] are regarded as different aspects of one supreme god. Even some fierce deities like [[Kali]] are not thought of as devils but just as darker aspects of God&lt;ref&gt;Seema Mohanty, Seema ''The Book of Kali'' Penguin Books India 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-143-06764-1}} page 115&lt;/ref&gt; and may even manifest benevolence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

== Ancient Egypt ==
{{Main|Apep|Set (mythology)}}
Apep ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|p|ɛ|p|,_|ˈ|ɑː|-}}) or Apophis ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|p|ə|f|ᵻ|s}}; {{lang-grc|Ἄποφις}}; also spelled Apepi or Aapep) was the [[ancient Egyptian deity]] who embodied [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] (''[[Isfet (Egyptian mythology)|ı͗zft]]'' in Egyptian) and was thus the opponent of light and [[Ma'at]] (order/[[truth]]). He appears in [[Art of ancient Egypt|art]] as a giant serpent. His name is reconstructed by Egyptologists as *ʻAʼpāpī, as it was written ''ꜥꜣpp(y)'' and survived in later [[Coptic language|Coptic]] as {{coptic|Ⲁⲫⲱⲫ}} ''Aphōph''.&lt;ref name="Wörterbuch"&gt;[[Adolf Erman|Erman, Adolf]], and [[Hermann Grapow]], eds. 1926–1953. ''Wörterbuch der aegyptischen Sprache im Auftrage der deutschen Akademien''. 6 vols. Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs'schen Buchhandlungen. (Reprinted Berlin: Akademie-Verlag GmbH, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

The deity Set was originally associated with both positive and negative roles: a protector of [[Ra]] on the solar boat from the Serpent of Chaos, and a [[usurper]] who killed and mutilated his brother in order to assume the throne. However, he was later [[Demonizing the enemy|demonized]] and he became quite unpopular. According to Herman te Velde, the demonization of Set took place after Egypt's conquest by several foreign nations in the [[Third Intermediate Period|Third Intermediate]] and [[Late Period of Ancient Egypt|Late Periods]]. Set, who had traditionally been the god of foreigners, thus also became associated with foreign oppressors, including the [[Assyria]]n and [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] empires. It was during this time that Set was particularly vilified, and his defeat by [[Horus]] widely celebrated. Set's negative aspects were emphasized during this period. Set was the killer of [[Osiris]], having hacked Osiris' body into pieces and dispersed it so that he could not be [[Resurrection|resurrected]]. The Greeks later linked Set with [[Typhon]] because both were evil forces, [[Weather god|storm deities]], and sons of the Earth that attacked the main gods.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Nevertheless, throughout this period, in some outlying regions of Egypt Set was still regarded as the heroic chief deity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Set has also been classed as a [[Trickster]] deity who, as a god of disorder, resorts to deception to achieve bad ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2009|title=The Trickster Revisited: Deception as a Motif in the Pentateuch|journal=Studies in Biblical Literature|volume=117|pages=16–17|author=Dean Andrew Nicholas|ISSN=1089-0645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zoroastrianism ==
{{Main|Angra Mainyu|Dualistic cosmology}}
[[Zoroastrianism]] probably introduced the first idea of the conceptual ''devil''; a principle of evil independently existing apart from God.&lt;ref name="Russell99"&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 99&lt;/ref&gt; In Zoroastrianism, good and evil derive from two ultimately opposed forces.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Hinnells ''The Zoroastrian Diaspora: Religion and Migration'' OUP Oxford 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-191-51350-3}} page 108&lt;/ref&gt; The force of good is called [[Ahura Mazda]] and the "destructive spirit" in [[Avestan language|Avestan-language]] called [[Angra Mainyu]]. The [[Middle Persian]] equivalent is [[Ahriman]]. They are in eternal struggle and neither is all-powerful, especially Angra Mainyu is limited to space and time: in the end of time, he will be finally defeated. While Ahura Mazda creates what is good, Angra Mainyu is responsible for every evil and suffering in the world, such as toads and scorpions.&lt;ref name="Russell99"/&gt;

== Buddhism ==
[[Buddhism]] contains a devil-like figure called [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; ([[Sanskrit]]: ''māra''; {{CJKV|t=魔|s=魔|p=mó}}; Tibetan Wylie: ''bdud''; {{lang-km|មារ}}; {{lang-my|မာရ်နတ်}}; {{lang-th|มาร}}; {{lang-si|මාරයා}}), who is a tempter figure in Buddhism, distracting humans from practicing the spiritual life by making mundane things alluring, or the negative seem positive. He tempted [[Gautama Buddha]] by trying to seduce him with the vision of beautiful women who, in various legends, are often said to be [[Mara (demon)#Three daughters|Mara's daughters]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 4.25, entitled, "Māra's Daughters" (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 217-20), as well as [[Suttanipata|Sn]] 835 (Saddhatissa, 1998, page 98). In each of these texts, Mara's daughters (''Māradhītā'') are personified by sensual Craving (''[[taṇhā]]''), Aversion (''arati'') and Passion (''rāga'').&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Buddhist cosmology]], Mara personifies unwholesome impulses, unskillfulness, the "death"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nirvanadhamma.com/en/articles/hidden-danger-of-existence%21/higher-realms/mara-the-god-of-death/ Mara-the god of death]&lt;/ref&gt; of the spiritual life.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Tengrism ==
Among the [[Tengrism|Tengristic]] myths, [[Erlik]] refers to a devil-like figure as the ruler of [[Tamag|hell]], who is also the first human. According to one narrative, Erlik and God swam together over the primordial waters. When God was about to create the earth, he send Erlik to dive into the waters and collect some mud. Erlik hid inside his mouth to later create his own world. But when God commanded earth to expand Erlik got troubled by the earth in his mouth. God aided Erlik to spit it out. The earth carried by Erlik gave place to the unpleasant areas of the world. Because of his sin, he was assigned to evil. In another cariant, the creator-god is identified with [[Ulgen]]. Again, Erlik appears to be the first human. He desired to create a human just as Ulgen did, thereupon Ulgen reacted by punishing Erlik, casting him into the underworld there he becomes its ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade ''History of Religious Ideas, Volume 3: From Muhammad to the Age of Reforms'' University of Chicago Press, 31.12.2013 {{ISBN|9780226147727}} p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Adams Leeming ''A Dictionary of Creation Myths'' Oxford University Press 2014 {{ISBN|9780195102758}} p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tengrism, there is no death by meaning that life comes to an end, it is merely a transition into the invisible world. As the ruler of hell, Erlik enslaves the souls, who are damned to hell. Further he lurks on the souls of those humans living on earth, by causing death, disease and illnesses. At time of birth, Erlik sends a [[Kormos]] to seize the soul of the new-born, following him the rest of his life in an attempt to seize his soul by hampering, misguide and injure him. When Erlik succeeds in destroying the a humans body, the Kormos sent by Erlik will try take him down into the underworld. However a good soul will be brought to paradise, by a ''Yayutshi'' sent by Ulgen.&lt;ref&gt;Plantagenet Publishing ''The Cambridge Medieval History Series volumes 1-5'' &lt;/ref&gt; Some shamans also made sacrifices to Erlik, for gaining a higher rank in the underworld, if they should be damned to hell.

== Yazidism ==
According to [[Yazidism]] there is no entity that represents evil in opposition to God; such [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] is rejected by Yazidis,&lt;ref&gt;Birgül Açikyildiz ''The Yezidis: The History of a Community, Culture and Religion'' I.B.Tauris 2014 {{ISBN|978-0-857-72061-0}} page 74&lt;/ref&gt; and evil is regarded as non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Wadie Jwaideh ''The Kurdish National Movement: Its Origins and Development'' Syracuse University Press 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-815-63093-7}} page 20&lt;/ref&gt; Yazidis adhere to strict monism and are prohibited from uttering the word "devil" and from speaking of anything related to [[hell]].&lt;ref&gt;Florin Curta, Andrew Holt ''Great Events in Religion: An Encyclopedia of Pivotal Events in Religious History [3 volumes]'' ABC-CLIO 2016 {{ISBN|978-1-610-69566-4}} page 513&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judaism ==
{{Further|Satan#Judaism}}
[[Yahweh]], the god in pre-exilic [[Judaism]], created both good and evil, as stated in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 45:7: "I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things." The Devil did not exist in early Jewish scriptures. However, the influence of [[Zoroastrianism]] during the [[Achaemenid Empire]] introduced evil as a separate principle into the Jewish belief-system, which gradually externalized the opposition until the Hebrew term ''satan'' developed into a specific type of supernatural entity, changing the monistic view of Judaism into a dualistic one.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN| 978-0-801-49409-3}} page 58&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Rabbinic Judaism]] rejected{{when?|date=October 2018}} the [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah) | Enochian books]] (written during the [[Second Temple period]] under [[Persians|Persian]] influence), which depicted the Devil as an independent force of evil besides God.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, David R. (2004). ''Enochic Judaism. London: T&amp;T Clark International.'' pp. 2–4. {{ISBN| 0826470890}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Apocalyptic literature| apocalyptic period]], references to [[Satan#Judaism|Satan]] in the [[Tanakh]] are thought{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to be [[allegorical]].&lt;ref&gt;

In [[Christianity]], evil is incarnate in the Devil or [[Satan]], a fallen angel who is the primary opponent of [[God in Christianity|God]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQFtlva3HaYC|title=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology|last=Leeming|first=David|date=2005-11-17|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780195156690|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity identifies the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]] with the [[Serpents in the Bible|serpent]] who tempted [[Adam and Eve]] to eat the [[forbidden fruit]], and describes him as a [[fallen angel]] who terrorizes the world through evil,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is the [[antithesis]] of [[God|Truth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/devil|title=Definition of DEVIL|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shall be condemned, together with the fallen angels who follow him, to eternal fire at the [[Last Judgement]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In mainstream [[Christianity]] the devil is usually referred to as [[Satan]]. Some modern Christians {{Who|date=April 2016}} consider the devil to be an [[angel]] who, along with one-third of the angelic host (the demons) rebelled against [[God]] and has consequently been condemned to the [[Lake of Fire]]. He is described {{Attribution needed|date=April 2016}} as hating all humanity (or more accurately creation), opposing God, spreading lies and wreaking havoc on their souls.

Satan is often identified {{by whom|date=April 2016}} as the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] who convinced [[Eve]] to eat the [[forbidden fruit]]; thus, Satan has often been depicted as a serpent. Although this identification is not present in the [[Adam and Eve]] narrative, this interpretation goes back at least as far as the time of the writing of the [[Book of Revelation]], which specifically identifies Satan as being the serpent (Rev. 20:2).

In the [[Bible]], the devil is identified with "the dragon" and "the old serpent" in the [[Book of Revelation]] 12:9, 20:2 have also been identified with Satan, as has "the prince of this world" in the [[Gospel of John]] 12:31, 14:30; and "the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience" in the [[Epistle to the Ephesians]] 2:2; and "the god of this world" in [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians|2 Corinthians]] 4:4.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|2:2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also identified as the dragon in the [[Book of Revelation]] (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#Chapter 12|Rev. 12:9]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and the tempter of the [[Gospels]] (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#Chapter 4|Mat. 4:1]]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The devil is sometimes called [[Lucifer]], particularly when describing him as an angel before his fall, although the reference in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 14:12 to Lucifer, or the Son of the Morning, is a reference to a Babylonian king.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the entries in [http://studylight.org/con/ntb/view.cgi?number=T3103 Nave's Topical Bible], the [http://studylight.org/dic/hbd/view.cgi?number=T3937 Holman Bible Dictionary] and the [http://studylight.org/com/acc/view.cgi?book=isa&amp;chapter=14&amp;verse=12#Isa14_12 Adam Clarke Commentary].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beelzebub]] is originally the name of a [[Philistines|Philistine]] god (more specifically a certain type of [[Baal]], from ''Ba‘al Zebûb'', lit. "Lord of Flies") but is also used in the New Testament as a synonym for Satan. A corrupted version, "Belzeboub", appears in [[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]] (Inferno XXXIV).

In other, non-mainstream, Christian beliefs (e.g. the beliefs of the [[Devil in Christianity#Unitarians and Christadelphians|Christadelphians]]) the word "satan" in the Bible is not regarded as referring to a supernatural, personal being but to any 'adversary' and figuratively refers to human sin and temptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/devil.htm |title=Do you Believe in a Devil?

=== Apocrypha/Deuterocanon ===
{{See also|Apocrypha|Biblical apocrypha|Deuterocanonical books}}
In the [[Book of Wisdom]], the devil is represented as the one who brought death into the world.&lt;ref&gt;"But by the envy of the devil, death came into the world" - Book of Wisdom II. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Book of Enoch]] contains references to a [[Watcher (angel)|Watcher angel]] called Satanael,&lt;ref&gt;[[2 Enoch]] 18:3&lt;/ref&gt; describing him as the prince of the ''[[Watcher (angel)|Grigori]]'' who was cast out of heaven&lt;ref&gt;"And I threw him out from the height with his angels, and he was flying in the air continuously above the bottomless" - [[2 Enoch]] 29:4&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[evil spirit]] who knew the difference between what was "righteous" and "sinful".&lt;ref&gt;"The devil is the evil spirit of the lower places, as a fugitive he made Sotona from the heavens as his name was Satanail, thus he became different from the angels, but his nature did not change his intelligence as far as his understanding of righteous and sinful things" - [[2 Enoch]] 31:4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Book of Jubilees]], Satan rules over a host of angels.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Martyrdom of Isaiah]]'', 2:2; ''[[Vita Adæ et Evæ]]'', 16)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mastema]], who induced God to test [[Abraham]] through the [[Binding of Isaac|sacrifice of Isaac]], is identical with Satan in both name and nature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Jubilees]], xvii. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Enoch contains references to [[Sathariel]], thought also {{By whom|date=April 2016}} to be Sataniel and [[Satanel|Satan'el]]. The similar spellings mirror that of his angelic brethren [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], [[Raphael (angel)|Raphael]], [[Uriel]] and [[Gabriel]], previous to his expulsion from Heaven.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[File:Lion-faced deity.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A lion-faced deity found on a Gnostic gem in [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]'s ''L'antiquité expliquée et représentée en figures'' may be a depiction of the Demiurge.]]
Gnostic and Gnostic influenced religions repeatedly addressed the idea, that the material world is inherently evil. The ''One true God'' is far remote, beyond the material universe, therefore this universe must be gouverned by an inferior imposter deity. This deity was identified by some sects, such as the [[Sethianism|Sethians]] or the [[Marcionism|Marcions]], with the deity of the Old testament. [[Tertullian]] accuses [[Marcion of Sinope]], that he {{quote|
[held that] the Old Testament was a scandal to the faithful … and … accounted for it by postulating [that Jehovah was] a secondary deity, a [[Demiurge|demiurgus]], who was god, in a sense, but not the supreme God; he was just, rigidly just, he had his good qualities, but he was not the good god, who was Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name="Marcion"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Marcionites}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[John Arendzen]] (1909) in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] (1913) mentions that [[Eusebius]] accused [[Apelles (gnostic)|Apelles]], the 2nd-century AD Gnostic, of considering the Inspirer of Old-Testament prophecies to be not a god, but an evil angel.&lt;ref name="Apelles"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Gnosticism}}&lt;/ref&gt; These writings commonly refer to the Creator of the material world as "a [[Demiurge|demiurgus]]".&lt;ref name="Marcion" /&gt; to distinguish him from the ''One true God''. Some texts, such as the ''[[Apocryphon of John]]'' and ''[[On the Origin of the World]]'' not only demonized the Creator God but also called him by the name of the devil in some Jewish writings, ''[[Samael]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Birger A.

=== Mandaeanism ===
According to [[Mandaean]] mythology, ''Ruha Qadishta'' fell apart from the "world of light" and gave birth to the "Lord of Darkness" (''malka dhshuka'')&lt;ref&gt;Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer ''The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition'' Shambhala Publications 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-834-82414-0}} page 552&lt;/ref&gt; named ''Ur''. According to one tradition, Ur is an androgyne lion-headed dragon with the wings of an eagle. Together they create several evil demons, [[lilith]]s and vampires. Ruha Qadishta is described as a liar and sorcerer. Several [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamitic prophets]] are regarded as servants of these devils or their subordinates such as [[Adonai]], including Moses.&lt;ref&gt;Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer ''The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition'' Shambhala Publications 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-834-82414-0}} page 553&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesus]] appears as another son of Ruha Qadishta and Ur, who distorted the [[Baptism]]-ritual thought by [[John the Baptist]].&lt;ref&gt;Nesta H.

=== Catharism ===
In the 12th century in Europe the [[Catharism|Cathars]], who were rooted in [[Gnosticism]], dealt with the problem of evil, and developed ideas of dualism and demonology. The Cathars were seen as a serious potential challenge to the Catholic church of the time. The Cathars split into two camps. The first is ''absolute'' dualism, which held that evil was completely separate from the good God, and that God and the devil each had power. The second camp is ''mitigated'' dualism, which considers [[Lucifer]] to be a son of God, and a brother to Christ. To explain this they used the parable of the prodigal son, with Christ as the good soon, and Lucifer as the son that strayed into evilness. The Catholic church responded to dualism in 1215 AD in the Fourth Lateran Council, saying that God created everything from nothing, and the Devil was good when he was created, but he made himself bad by his own free will.&lt;ref&gt;Rouner, Leroy (1983).

== Manichaeism ==
{{Main|Prince of darkness (Manichaeism)}}
In [[Manichaeism]], God and the Devil are two unrelated principles. God created ''good'' and inhabits the realm of light, while the devil (also called ''prince of darkness''&lt;ref name="Mani2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mani3" /&gt;) created evil and inhabits the kingdom of darkness. The existing came into existence, when the kingdom of darkness assaulted the kingdom of light and mingled with the spiritual world.&lt;ref&gt;Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer ''The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition'' Shambhala Publications 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-834-82414-0}} page 596&lt;/ref&gt; At the end, the devil and his followers will be sealed forever and the kingdom of light and the kingdom of darkness will continue to co-exist eternally never commingle again.&lt;ref&gt;Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer ''The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition'' Shambhala Publications 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-834-82414-0}} page 598&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[God in Islam|God]] created [[Adam in Islam|Adam]], he ordered the angels to prostrate themselves before him. All did, but Iblis refused and claimed to be superior to Adam out of pride.{{Cite Quran|7|12}} Therefore, pride but also envy became a sign of "unbelief" in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Jerald D.

Vroom ''Probing the Depths of Evil and Good: Multireligious Views and Case Studies'' Rodopi 2007 {{ISBN|9789042022317}} page 250&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter Iblis was condemned to hell, but God granted him a request to lead humanity astray&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|17|62}}&lt;/ref&gt;, knowing the righteous will resist Iblis' attempts to misguide them. In Islam, both good and evil are ultimately created by God. But since God's will is good, the evil in the world must be part of God's plan.&lt;ref&gt;Jerald D. Gort, Henry Jansen, Hendrik M.

Vroom ''Probing the Depths of Evil and Good: Multireligious Views and Case Studies'' Rodopi 2007 {{ISBN|9789042022317}} page 249&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers and mystics emphasized Iblis himself as a role model of confidence in God, because God ordered the angels to prostrate themselves, Iblis was forced to choose between God's command and God's will (not to praise someone else than God). He successfully passed the test, yet his disobedience caused his punishment and therefore suffering. However, he stays patient and is rewarded in the end.&lt;ref&gt;Jerald D.

Muslims held that the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] [[Jinn]], [[Tutelary deity|tutelary deities]], became subject under [[Islam]] to the judgment of God, and that those who did not submit to the law of God are [[Shaitan|demons]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Like in Christianity, Iblis was once a pious creature of God, but later cast out of heaven, due to his pride. However, to maintain God's absolute sovereignty&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 45&lt;/ref&gt;, Islam adopts the line taken by Irenaeus, instead of the later Christian consensus, that the Devil did not rebel against God, but against humanity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell ''Lucifer: The Devil in the Middle Ages'' Cornell University Press 1986 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49429-1}} page 57&lt;/ref&gt; Further, although Iblis is generally regarded as a real bodily entity,&lt;ref&gt;Cenap Çakmak ''Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopedia [4 volumes]'' ABC-CLIO 2017 {{ISBN|978-1-610-69217-5}} page 1399&lt;/ref&gt; he plays a less significant role as the personification of evil than in Christianity. Iblis is merely a tempter, notable for inciting humans into sin by ''whispering'' into humans minds (waswās), akin to the Jewish idea of the Devil as ''[[yetzer hara]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fereshteh Ahmadi, Nader Ahmadi ''Iranian Islam: The Concept of the Individual'' Springer 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-230-37349-5}} page 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nils G. Holm ''The Human Symbolic Construction of Reality: A Psycho-Phenomenological Study'' LIT Verlag Münster 2014 {{ISBN|978-3-643-90526-0}} page 54&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, ''Shaitan'' refers unilaterally to forces of evil, including the Devil Iblis, then he causes mischief.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/shaitan&lt;/ref&gt; Shaitan is also linked to humans psychological nature, appearing in dreams, causing anger or interrupting the mental preparation for prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Cenap Çakmak ''Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopedia [4 volumes]'' ABC-CLIO 2017 {{ISBN|978-1-610-69217-5}} page 1399&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the term ''Shaitan'' also refers to beings, who follow the evil suggestions of Iblis. Furthermore, the principle of "Shaitan" is in many ways a symbol of spiritual impurity, representing humans own deficits, in contrast to a "[[Mumin|true Muslim]]", who is free from anger, lust and other devilish desires.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gauvain ''Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|9780710313560}} page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Sufism and Mysticsm ===
{{See also|Nafs}}
In contrast to ''Occidental philosophy'', the Sufi idea of seeing "Many as One" and considering the creation in their essence as the Absolute, leads to the idea of the dissolution of any dualism between the ego substance and the "external" substinantial objects. The rebellion against God, mentioned in the Quran, takes place on the level of the [[nafs|psyche]], that must be trained and disciplined for its union with the [[Ruh|spirit]] that is pure. Since psyche drives the body, ''flesh'' is not the obstacle to human, but an unawarness that allowed the impulsive forces to cause rebellion against God on the level of the psyche. Yet, it is not a dualism between body, psyche and spirit, since the spirit embraces both psyche and corperal aspects of human.&lt;ref&gt;Fereshteh Ahmadi, Nader Ahmadi ''Iranian Islam: The Concept of the Individual'' Springer 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-230-37349-5}} page 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; Since the world is hold as the mirror in which God's attributes are reflected, participation in worldly affairs is not necessarily seen as opposed to God.&lt;ref&gt;Fereshteh Ahmadi, Nader Ahmadi ''Iranian Islam: The Concept of the Individual'' Springer 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-230-37349-5}} page 79&lt;/ref&gt; The Devil activates the selfish desires of the psyche, leading him astray from the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Kane, Bernd Radtke ''The Concept of Sainthood in Early Islamic Mysticism: Two Works by Al-Hakim Al-Tirmidhi - An Annotated Translation with Introduction'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-136-79309-7}} page 48&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is the  ''[[I (pronoun)|I]]'' that is regarded as evil, and both Iblis as well as [[Pharaohs in the Bible|''Pharao'']] are present as symbols for uttering "I" in ones own behavior. Therefore it is recommanded, to use the term ''I'' as rare as possible. It is only God who has the right to say "I", since it is only God, who is self-subsistent. Uttering "I" is therefore a way to compare oneselves to God, regarded as ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J.

Human beings are seen to have [[free will]], and are thus able to turn towards God and develop spiritual qualities or turn away from God and become immersed in their self-centered desires. Individuals who follow the temptations of the self and do not develop spiritual virtues are often described in the Bahá'í writings with the word ''satanic''.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; The Bahá'í writings also state that the devil is a metaphor for the "insistent self" or "lower self" which is a self-serving inclination within each individual.

[[File:Baphomet.png|thumb|upright|The [[Baphomet]], adopted symbol of some [[Left-Hand Path]] systems, including [[Theistic Satanism]].]]
In some religions and traditions, these titles are separate demons; others identify these names as guises of the devil. Even when thought of as individual demons, some are often thought of being under the Devil's direct control. This identifies only those thought of as the devil; [[List of theological demons|List of demons]] has a more general listing.

'''Diane F. Halpern''' is an American [[psychology|psychologist]] and former president of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA). She is Dean of Social Science at the [[Minerva Schools at KGI]] ([[Keck Graduate Institute]]) and also the McElwee Family Professor of Psychology at [[Claremont McKenna College]]. She is also past-president of the Western Psychological Association, The Society for the Teaching of Psychology, and the Division of General Psychology.

Halpern served on boards and panels at the APA including the Board of Educational Affairs, the Council of Representatives, the Committee on International Relations in Psychology, the Committee on Learning Outcomes, and Teachers of Psychology in Secondary Schools. She chaired the Panel on Public Policy and APA's National Conference on Undergraduate Education that resulted in the publication ''Undergraduate Education in Psychology: A Blueprint for the Future of the Discipline''.

Along with Keith Millis (Northern Illinois University) and [[Arthur C. Graesser]] (University of Memphis), Halpern developed Operation ARA, a computerized game that teaches scientific reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Operation ARA: A computerized learning game that teaches critical thinking and scientific reasoning.|journal=Thinking Skills and Creativity|year=2012|volume=7|issue=2|pages=93–100|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187112000235|doi=10.1016/j.tsc.2012.03.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also developed the Halpern Critical Thinking Assessment (Schuhfried Publishers)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HCTA Halpern Critical Thinking Assessment|url=http://www.schuhfried.com/viennatestsystem10/tests-test-sets/all-tests-from-a-z/test/hcta-halpern-critical-thinking-assessment-1/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215150538/http://www.schuhfried.com/viennatestsystem10/tests-test-sets/all-tests-from-a-z/test/hcta-halpern-critical-thinking-assessment-1|archivedate=2013-12-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that uses multiple response formats which allow test-takers to demonstrate their ability to think about everyday topics using both constructed response and recognition formats.

Halpern received her B.A. from [[University of Pennsylvania]] and an M.A. from [[Temple University]]. She then received an M.A., from [[University of Cincinnati]], followed by a Ph.D. from that institution in 1979. After teaching for many years at the [[California State University, San Bernardino]], she is currently Professor of Psychology at [[Claremont McKenna College]].

In 1995, Halpern was part of an 11-member APA task force led by [[Ulric Neisser]] which published ''[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]'', a report written in response to ''[[The Bell Curve]]''. She has also written on cognitive differences between men and women. She suggests a biopsychosocial model offers superior insight into cognitive sex differences than a simple nature-vs-nurture dichotomy. Another topic of her research is risks associated with [[left-handedness]].&lt;ref name="reuters1991"&gt;Reuters (April 4, 1991). [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/04/us/being-left-handed-may-be-dangerous-to-life-study-says.html Being Left-Handed May Be Dangerous To Life, Study Says.] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Halpern has also written in opposition of single-sex schooling, noting that it "lacks scientific support and may exaggerate sexism and gender stereotyping."&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;Science (September 23, 2011). [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6050/1706 The Pseudoscience of Single-Sex Schooling.] ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Halpern has won awards for her teaching and research, including:
* 2013 James McKeen Cattell Award from the Association for Psychological Science (APS) (highest award given by APS)
* 2013 American Psychological Foundation Arthur W. Staats Award 
* 2009 George A. Miller Award for the outstanding journal article in psychology
* 2004 Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters (Ph.D.) Mount St. Mary’s College (Los Angeles)
* 2002 Outstanding Professor Award from the Western Psychological Association

'''Disorders of consciousness''' are [[medical conditions]] that inhibit [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name="chronic"/&gt; Some define disorders of consciousness as any change from complete self-awareness to inhibited or absent self-awareness and arousal. This category generally includes [[minimally conscious state]] and [[persistent vegetative state]], but sometimes also includes the less severe [[locked-in syndrome]] and more severe but rare [[coma|chronic coma]].&lt;ref name="chronic"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bernat JL|date=8 Apr 2006|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68508-5|issue=9517|journal=Lancet|pages=1181–1192|pmid=16616561|title=Chronic disorders of consciousness|volume=367}}

==Classification==
Patients in such a dramatically altered state of consciousness present unique problems for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. 
Assessment of cognitive functions remaining after a traumatic brain injury is difficult. Voluntary movements may be very small, inconsistent and easily exhausted. Quantification of brain activity differentiates patients who sometimes only differ by a brief and small movement of a finger.

Consciousness is a complex and multifaceted concept, divided into two main components: [[Arousal]] and [[Awareness]].
Arousal is associated with functional [[brainstem]] neuron populations projecting to both [[Thalamus|thalamic]] and [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortical]] neurons.&lt;ref&gt;Steriade M, Jones BG, McCormick D. Thalamus. NewYork Elesevier, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the assessment of reflexes (Using the Glasgow Coma Scale) is important to investigate the functional integrity of the brainstem.
Awareness is thought to be related with functional integrity of the cerebral cortex and its subcortical connections.
The most important point regarding the classification of disorders of consciousness is, that consciousness cannot be measured objectively by any machine, although many scoring systems have been developed for the quantification of consciousness and neuroimaging techniques are important tools for clinical research, extending our understanding of underlying mechanisms involved.&lt;ref&gt;Laureys S, Majerus S, Moonen G. Assessing consciousness in critically ill patients. In: Vincent JL, ed. 2002 Yearbook of Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine. Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag, 2002: 715-27&lt;/ref&gt; Disorders in consciousness represent immense social and ethical issues because the diagnosis is methodologically complex and needs careful interpretation. Also the ethical framework must be further developed to guide research in these patients.

===Locked-in syndrome===
{{main|Locked-in syndrome}}
In [[locked-in syndrome]] the patient has awareness, sleep-wake cycles, and meaningful behavior (viz., eye-movement), but is isolated due to [[quadriplegia]] and [[pseudobulbar palsy]], resulting from the disruption of corticospinal and corticobulbar pathways. Locked-in syndrome is a condition in which a patient is aware and awake but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for the eyes. Eye or eyelid movements are the main method of communication.&lt;ref&gt;American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine. Recommendations for use of uniform nomenclature pertinent to patients with severe alternations of consciousness. Arch Pyhs Med Rehabil 1995; 76;: 205-9&lt;/ref&gt; Total locked-in syndrome is a version of locked-in syndrome where the eyes are paralyzed as well.&lt;ref name= "bauer1979varieties"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00313105 | author =Bauer, G. and Gerstenbrand, F. and Rumpl, E. | title= Varieties of the locked-in syndrome | journal= Journal of Neurology | volume =221 |issue=2 |pages=77–91 |year=1979 |pmid=92545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimally conscious state===
{{main|Minimally conscious state}}
In a [[minimally conscious state]], the patient has intermittent periods of awareness and wakefulness. The criteria for minimally conscious state, that patients are not in a [[vegetative state]] but are not able to communicate consistently. This means, that patients have to show limited but reproducible signs of awareness of themself or their environment. This could be following of simple commands, intelligible speech or purposeful behavior (including movements or affective behavior in relation to external stimuli, but not reflexive activity).&lt;ref name="Laureys, Steven 2004"&gt;Laureys, Steven, Adrian M. Owen, and Nicholas D. Schiff. "Brain function in coma, vegetative state, and related disorders." The Lancet Neurology 3.9 (2004): 537-546.&lt;/ref&gt;
Further improvement towards full conscious recovery is more likely in this state than in the vegetative state, but still some patients remain in the MCS constantly.&lt;ref&gt;Giacino JT. Disorders of consciousness: differential diagnosis and neuropathologic features. Semin Neurol 1997; 17:105-11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persistent vegetative state===
{{main|Persistent vegetative state}}
In a [[persistent vegetative state]], the patient has sleep-wake cycles, but lacks awareness, is not able to communicate and only displays reflexive and non-purposeful behavior. The term refers to an organic body that is able to grow and develop devoid of intellectual activity or social intercourse.&lt;ref name="Laureys, Steven 2004"/&gt; The diagnosis of the vegetative state should be questioned when there is any degree of sustained and reproducible visual pursuit or fixation or response to threatening gestures.
This state reflects an intact brainstem and allied structures but severely damaged white and gray matter in both cerebral hemispheres. The preservation of these structures maintains arousal and automatic functions.&lt;ref&gt;Laureys S, Faymonville ME, Goldman S, et al. Impaired cerebral connectivity in vegetative state. In: Gjedde A, Hansen SB, Knudsen GM, Paulson OB, eds. Physiological imaging of the brain with PET. San Diego: Academic Press, 2000: 329-34.&lt;/ref&gt; The overall metabolism drops in average to 40-50% of the normal range. After four weeks in a vegetative state (VS), the patient is classified as in a persistent vegetative state. Here the metabolism drops to 30-40% of the normal range but seems to be a result of trans-synaptic neuronal degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Tommasino C, Grana C, Lucignani G, Torri G, Fazio F. Regional cerebral metabolism of glucose in comatose and vegetative patients. J Neurosurg Anesthesiol 1995; 7: 109-16&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the diagnosis is problematic, the formal absence of any sign of conscious perception or deliberate action is essential.
This diagnosis can be further classified as a permanent vegetative state (PVS) after approximately 1 year of being in a vegetative state after traumatic brain injury&lt;ref&gt;Menon DK, Owen AM, Williams EJ, et al. Cortical processing in persistent vegetative state. Lancet 1998; 352: 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronic coma===
{{main|Chronic coma}}
[[chronic coma|Like coma, chronic coma]] results mostly from cortical or white-matter damage after neuronal or axonal injury, or from focal brainstem lesions.Usually the metabolism in the grey matter decreases to 50-70% of the normal range. The patient lacks awareness and arousal. The patient lies with eyes closed and is not aware of self or surroundings. Stimulation cannot produce spontaneous periods of wakefulness and eye-opening, unlike patients in vegetative state. In medicine, a coma (from the Greek κῶμα koma, meaning deep sleep) is a state of unconsciousness, lasting more than six hours in which a person cannot be awakened, fails to respond normally to painful stimuli, light, sound, lacks a normal sleep-wake cycle and does not initiate voluntary actions. Although, according to the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]], a person with confusion is considered to be in the mildest coma. But cerebral metabolism has been shown to correlate poorly with the level of consciousness in patients with mild to severe injury within the first month after traumatic brain injury (TBI).&lt;ref&gt;Bersneider M, Havda DA, Lee SM, et al. Dissociation of cerebral glucose metabolism and level of consciousness during the period of metabolic depression following human traumatic brain injury. J Neurotrauma 200; 17: 389-401&lt;/ref&gt;
A person in a state of coma is described as comatose. In general patients surviving a coma recover gradually within 2–4 weeks. But recovery to full awareness and arousal is not always possible. Some patients do not progress further than vegetative state or minimally conscious state and sometimes this also results in prolonged stages before further recovery to complete consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Plum F, Posner JB. The diagnosis of stupor and coma (3rd edn). Philadelphia: FA Davis, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a coma patient may appear to be awake, they are unable to consciously feel, speak, hear, or move. For a patient to maintain consciousness, two important neurological components must function impeccably. The first is the cerebral cortex which is the gray matter covering the outer layer of the brain. The other is a structure located in the brainstem, called [[reticular activating system]] (RAS or ARAS). Injury to either or both of these components is sufficient to cause a patient to experience a coma.

===Brain death===

Brain death is the irreversible end of all brain activity, and function (including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life). The main cause is total necrosis of the cerebral neurons following loss of brain oxygenation. After [[brain death]] the patient lacks any sense of awareness; sleep-wake cycles or behavior, and typically look as if they are dead or are in a deep sleep-state or coma. Although visually similar to a comatose state such as persistent vegetative state, the two should not be confused. Criteria for brain death differ from country to country. However, the clinical assessments are the same and require the loss of all brainstem reflexes and the demonstration of continuing [[apnea]] in a persistently comatose patient (&lt; 4 weeks).&lt;ref&gt;Medical Consultants on the Diagnosis of Death. Guidelines for the determination of death: report of the medical consultants on the diagnosis of death to the President's commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research. JAMA 1981; 246: 2184-86&lt;/ref&gt; 
Functional imaging using PET or CT scans, typically show a hollow skull phenomenon. This confirms the absence of neuronal function in the whole brain.
Patients classified as brain dead are legally dead and can qualify as organ donors, in which their organs are surgically removed and prepared for a particular recipient.

Brain death is one of the deciding factors when pronouncing a trauma patient as dead. Determining function and presence of necrosis after trauma to the whole brain or brain-stem may be used to determine brain death, and is used in many states in the US.

==Methodological problems==

Metabolic studies are useful, but they are not able identify neural activity within a specific region to specific cognitive processes. Functionality can only be identified at the most general level: Metabolism in cortical and subcortical regions that may contribute to cognitive processes.

At present, there is no established relation between cerebral metabolic rates of glucose or oxygen as measured by PET and patient outcome. The decrease of cerebral metabolism occurs also when patients are treated with anesthetics to the point of unresponsiveness. Lowest value (28% of normal range) have been reported during propofol anesthesia. Also deep sleep represents a phase of decreased metabolism (down to 40% of the normal range)&lt;ref&gt;Maquet P, Degueldre C, Delfiore G, et al. Functional neuroanatomy of human slow wave sleep. J Neurosci 1997; 17 2807-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchsbaum MS, Gillin JC, Wu J, et al. Regional cerebral glucose metabolic rate in human sleep assessed by positron emission tomography. Life Sci 1989; 45: 1349-56&lt;/ref&gt;
In general, quantitative PET studies and the assessment of cerebral metabolic rates depends on many assumptions.
PET for example requires a correction factor, [[Positron emission tomography|the lumped constant]], which is stable in healthy brains. There are reports, that a global decrease of this constant emerges after a traumatic brain injury.&lt;ref&gt;Wu HM, Huang SC, Hattori N, et al. Selective metabolic reduction in gray matter acutely following human traumatic brain injury. J Neurotrauma 2004; 21: 149-61&lt;/ref&gt;
But not only the correction factors change due to TBI. 
Another issue is the possibility of anaerobic glycolysis that could occur after TBI. In such a case the glucose levels measured by the PET are not tightly connected to the oxygen consumption of the patient's brain.&lt;ref&gt;Hovda DA, Becker DP, Katayama Y. Secondary injury and acidosis. J Neurotrauma 1992; 9 (suppl 1): S47-60&lt;/ref&gt;
Third point regarding PET scans is the overall measurement per unit volume of brain tissue. The imaging can be affected by the inclusion of metabolically inactive spaces e.g. [[cerebrospinal fluid]]in the case of gross hydrocephalus, which artificially lowers the calculated metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;Meltzer CC, Zubieta JK, Links JM, et al. MR-based correction of brain PET measurements for heterogeneous gray matter radioactivity distribution. J Cereb Blood Flow Metlab 1996; 16: 650-58&lt;/ref&gt;
Also the issue of radiation exposure must be considered in patients with already severely damaged brains and preclude longitudinal or follow-up studies.

==Ethical issues==

Disorders of consciousness present a variety of ethical concerns.
Most obvious is the lack of consent in any treatment decisions. Patients in PVS or MCS are not able to decide for the possibility of withdrawal of life-support. It is also a general question whether they should receive life-sustaining therapy and, if so, for how long? The problems regarding a patient's consent also account for neuroimaging studies. Without patient's consent, such studies are perceived as unethical.&lt;ref&gt;Fins JJ. Constructing an ethical stereotaxy for severe brain injury: balancing risks, benefits and access. Nat Rev Neurosci 2003; 4: 323-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally only few patients have created advance directives before losing decision-making capacity.
Typically approval must be obtained from family or legal representatives depending on governmental and hospital guidelines. 
But even with the consent of representatives, researchers have been refused grants, ethics committee approval and publication.
&lt;br /&gt;
Social issues arise from the enormous costs that are caused by people with disorders of consciousness. Especially chronic comatose and vegetative patients, when recovery is highly unlikely and treatment in the ICU is considered futile by clinicians.
In addition to the aforementioned problems, the question rises why medical resources were being used not for the broader public good but for patients who seemed to have only little to gain from them.
Still research is everything but sure about the irreversibility of these conditions. Some studies demonstrated that some patients suffering from disorders of consciousness may be aware despite clinical unresponsiveness. These recent findings could have a major impact on ethical and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Jox RJ, Bernat JL, Laureys S, Racine E. Disorders of consciousness: responding to request for novel diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Lancet Neurol. 2012; 11(8): 732-38&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2723">The '''effective selfing model''' is a [[mathematical model]] that describes the [[mating system]] of a [[plant]] [[population]] in terms of the degree of [[self-fertilisation]] present.&lt;ref name="Ritland 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ritland, Kermit | year = 1984 | title = The effective proportion of self-fertilisation with consanguineous matings in inbred populations | journal = Genetics | volume = 106 | pages = 139–152 | pmid = 17246188 | issue = 1 | pmc = 1202242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"&gt;{{cite book | author = Brown, A.

It was developed in the 1980s by Kermit Ritland, as an alternative to the simplistic [[mixed mating model]]. The mixed mating model assumes that every [[fertilisation]] event may be classed as either self-fertilisation, or [[outcrossing]] with a completely [[random]] mate. That is, it assumes that [[inbreeding]] is caused solely by self-fertilisation. This assumption is often violated in wild plant populations, where inbreeding may be due to outcrossing between closely related plants. For example, in dense stands, mating often occurs between plants in close proximity; and in plants with short [[seed dispersal]] distances, plants are often closely related to their nearest neighbours. When both these criteria are met, plants will tend to be closely related to the near neighbours with which they mate, resulting in significant inbreeding. In such a scenario, the mixed mating model will attribute all inbreeding to self-fertilisation, and therefore overestimate the extent of self-fertilisation occurring. The effective selfing model takes into account the potential for inbreeding to occur as a result of outcrossing between closely related plants, by considering the extent of kinship between mates.&lt;ref name="Ritland 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"/&gt;

Ultimately, it is not possible to tease apart the two potential causes of inbreeding, and attributed the observed inbreeding to one cause or the other. Therefore, just as with the mixed mating model, in the effective selfing model there is only one parameter to be estimated. However this parameter, termed the '''effective selfing rate''', is often a more accurate measure of the proportion of self-fertilisation than the corresponding parameter in the mixed mating model.&lt;ref name="Ritland 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"/&gt;

'''Enthalpy''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|n|θ|əl|p|i|audio=en-US-enthalpy.ogg}}, a property of a [[thermodynamic system]], is equal to the system's [[internal energy]] plus the product of its pressure and volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/enthalpy |title=Oxford Living Dictionaries |accessdate=2018-02-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817085918/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/enthalpy |archivedate=2016-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/html/E/E02141.html |title=IUPAC Gold Book. Enthalpy, H |accessdate=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; For processes at constant pressure, the heat absorbed or released equals the change in enthalpy.

The unit of measurement for enthalpy in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) is the [[joule]]. Other historical conventional units still in use include the [[British thermal unit|British thermal unit (BTU)]] and the [[calorie]].

Enthalpy comprises a system's [[internal energy]], which is the energy required to create the system, plus the amount of [[work (physics)|work]] required to make room for it by displacing its [[environment (systems)|environment]] and establishing its volume and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mark W. |last=Zemansky |date=1968 |title=Heat and Thermodynamics |chapter=Chapter 11 |edition=5th |page=275 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enthalpy is defined as a [[state function]] that depends only on the prevailing equilibrium state identified by the system's internal energy, pressure, and volume. It is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] quantity.

Enthalpy is the preferred expression of system energy changes in many chemical, biological, and physical measurements at constant pressure, because it simplifies the description of [[energy transfer]]. At constant pressure, the enthalpy change equals the energy transferred from the environment through heating or work other than expansion work.

The total enthalpy, ''H'', of a system cannot be measured directly. The same situation exists in classical mechanics: only a change or difference in energy carries physical meaning. Enthalpy itself is a thermodynamic potential, so in order to measure the enthalpy of a system, we must refer to a defined reference point; therefore what we measure is the change in enthalpy, Δ''H''. The Δ''H'' is a positive change in [[endothermic]] reactions, and negative in heat-releasing [[exothermic]] processes.

'''For processes under constant pressure''', Δ''H'' is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system, plus the [[Work (thermodynamics)#Pressure-volume work|pressure-volume work]] p ΔV done by the system on its surroundings (which is &gt; 0 for an expansion and &lt; 0 for a contraction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=G. J. |last1=Van Wylen |first2=R. E. |last2=Sonntag |date=1985 |title=Fundamentals of Classical Thermodynamics |chapter=Section 5.5 |edition=3rd |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-471-82933-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the change in enthalpy under such conditions is the heat absorbed or released by the system through a chemical reaction or by external heat transfer. Enthalpies for chemical substances at constant pressure usually refer to [[standard state]]: most commonly 1 bar pressure. Standard state does not, strictly speaking, specify a temperature (see [[standard state]]), but expressions for enthalpy generally reference the standard heat of formation at 25&amp;nbsp;°C.

Enthalpy of [[ideal gas]]es and incompressible solids and liquids does not depend on pressure, unlike [[entropy]] and [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs energy]]. Real materials at common temperatures and pressures usually closely approximate this behavior, which greatly simplifies enthalpy calculation and use in practical designs and analyses.

==History==
The word ''enthalpy'' was coined relatively late, in the early 20th century, in analogy with the 19th-century terms ''[[energy]]'' (introduced in its modern sense by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1802) and ''[[entropy]]'' (coined in analogy to ''energy'' by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in 1865).
It uses the root of Greek {{lang|grc|θάλπος}} "warmth, heat"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=qa%2Flpos&amp;la=greek&amp;can=qa%2Flpos0&amp;prior=qalpno/s#lexicon θάλπος] in ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
where ''energy'' has {{lang|grc|ἔργον}} "work" and ''entropy'' {{lang|grc|τροπή}} "transformation", by analogy expressing the idea of "heat-content" where energy refers to "work-content" and entropy to "transformation-content".
The term does in fact stand in for the older term "heat content",&lt;ref&gt;Howard (2002) quotes [[J. R. Partington]] in ''An Advanced Treatise on Physical Chemistry'' (1949) as saying that the function ''H'' was "usually called the heat content".&lt;/ref&gt; 
a term which is now mostly deprecated as misleading, as  {{mvar|dH}} refers to the amount of heat absorbed in a process at constant pressure only,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ignacio |last1=Tinoco, Jr. |first2=Kenneth |last2=Sauer |first3=James C. |last3=Wang |date=1995 |title=Physical Chemistry |page=41 |edition=3rd |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=978-0-13-186545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
but not in the general case (when pressure is variable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Keith J.|last1=Laidler |authorlink=Keith J. Laidler |first2=John H. |last2=Meiser |date=1982 |title=Physical Chemistry |page=53 |publisher=Benjamin/Cummings |isbn=978-0-8053-5682-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] used the term "a heat function for constant pressure" for clarity.&lt;ref group=note&gt;''The Collected Works of J. Willard Gibbs, Vol. I'' do not contain reference to the word enthalpy, but rather reference the "heat function for constant pressure". See: {{Cite book

|publisher= Academic Press|year= 1967|page= 29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduction of the concept of "heat content" {{mvar|H}} is associated with [[Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron]] and [[Rudolf Clausius]] ([[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]], 1850).

The term ''enthalpy'' first appeared in print in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Dalton, ''Proc. K. Akad. Wetens. Amsterdam'' 11 (1909), p. 863.&lt;/ref&gt; It is attributed to  [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]], who most likely introduced it orally the year before, at the first meeting of the Institute of Refrigeration in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Laidler|first1= Keith|authorlink= Keith J. Laidler|title= The World of Physical Chemistry|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 1995|page= 110}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
It gained currency only in the 1920s, notably with the ''[[enthalpy–entropy chart|Mollier Steam Tables and Diagrams]]'', published in 1927.

Until the 1920s, the symbol {{mvar|H}} was used, somewhat inconsistently, for "heat" in general. 
The definition of {{mvar|H}} as strictly limited to enthalpy or "heat content at constant pressure" was formally proposed by Alfred W. Porter in 1922.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;

==Formal definition==
The enthalpy of a thermodynamic system is defined as&lt;ref name="Guggenheim"&gt;{{cite book|first=E. A. |last=Guggenheim |title=Thermodynamics |publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company |location=Amsterdam |date=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Zumdahl, Steven S.|chapter=Thermochemistry|title=Chemistry|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=978-0-547-12532-9|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLWkH82PNbYC&amp;pg=PA243|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114034015/http://books.google.com/books?id=LLWkH82PNbYC&amp;pg=PA243|archivedate=2013-11-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H = U + p V,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''H'' is the enthalpy of the system,
:''U'' is the [[internal energy]] of the system,
:''p'' is the [[pressure]] of the system,
:''V'' is the [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] of the system.
Enthalpy is an [[extensive property]]. This means that, for homogeneous systems, the enthalpy is proportional to the size of the system. It is convenient to introduce the [[specific enthalpy]] ''h''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''H''|''m''}}, where ''m'' is the mass of the system, or the molar enthalpy ''H''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''H''|''n''}}, where ''n'' is the number of moles (''h'' and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; are [[intensive properties]]). For inhomogeneous systems the enthalpy is the sum of the enthalpies of the composing subsystems:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \sum_k H_k,&lt;/math&gt;

where the label ''k'' refers to the various subsystems. In case of continuously varying ''p'', ''T'' or composition, the summation becomes an integral:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \int \rho h \, dV,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is the density.

The enthalpy of homogeneous systems can be viewed as function ''H''(''S'',''p'') of the entropy ''S'' and the pressure ''p'', and a differential relation for it can be derived as follows. We start from the [[first law of thermodynamics]] for closed systems for an infinitesimal process:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \delta Q - \delta W.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''δQ''  is a small amount of heat added to the system, and ''δW'' a small amount of work performed by the system. In a homogeneous system only reversible processes can take place, so the [[second law of thermodynamics]] gives {{nowrap|''δQ'' {{=}} ''T&amp;thinsp;dS''}}, with ''T'' the [[absolute temperature]] of the system. Furthermore, if only ''pV'' work is done, {{nowrap|1=''δW'' = ''p&amp;thinsp;dV''}}. As a result,

:&lt;math&gt;dU = T\,dS - p\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;

Adding ''d''(''pV'') to both sides of this expression gives

:&lt;math&gt;dU + d(pV) = T\,dS - p\,dV + d(pV),&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;d(U + pV) = T\,dS + V\,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

So

:&lt;math&gt;dH(S,p) = T\,dS + V\,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

==Other expressions==
The above expression of ''dH'' in terms of entropy and pressure may be unfamiliar to some readers. However, there are expressions in terms of more familiar variables such as temperature and pressure:&lt;ref name="Guggenheim" /&gt;{{rp|88}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=M. J. |last1=Moran |first2=H. N. |last2=Shapiro |title=Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics |edition=5th |date=2006 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;dH = C_p\,dT + V(1 - \alpha T)\,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is the heat capacity at constant pressure and ''α'' is the coefficient of (cubic) thermal expansion:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_p.&lt;/math&gt;

With this expression one can, in principle, determine the enthalpy if ''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V'' are known as functions of ''p'' and ''T''.

Note that for an [[ideal gas]], ''αT''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&lt;ref group=note&gt;&lt;math&gt;\alpha T=\frac{T}{V}\left(\frac{\partial (\frac{n R T}{P})}{\partial T}\right)_p = \frac{nRT}{PV} = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; so that

:&lt;math&gt;dH = C_p\,dT.&lt;/math&gt;

In a more general form, the first law describes the internal energy with additional terms involving the [[chemical potential]] and the number of particles of various types. The differential statement for ''dH'' then becomes

:&lt;math&gt;dH = T\,dS + V\,dp + \sum_i \mu_i\,dN_i,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the chemical potential per particle for an ''i''-type particle, and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of such particles. The last term can also be written as {{nowrap|''μ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;''dn''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (with ''dn''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the number of moles of component ''i'' added to the system and, in this case, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the molar chemical potential) or as {{nowrap|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''dm''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (with ''dm''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the mass of component ''i'' added to the system and, in this case, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the specific chemical potential).

==Physical interpretation==
The ''U'' term can be interpreted as the energy required to create the system, and the ''pV'' term as the [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] that would be required to "make room" for the system if the pressure of the environment remained constant. When a system, for example, ''n'' [[Mole (unit)|moles]] of a gas of [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] ''V'' at [[pressure]] ''p'' and [[temperature]] ''T'', is created or brought to its present state from [[absolute zero]], energy must be supplied equal to its internal energy ''U'' plus ''pV'', where ''pV'' is the [[Work (physics)|work]] done in pushing against the ambient (atmospheric) pressure.

In basic [[physics]] and [[statistical mechanics]] it may be more interesting to study the internal properties of the system and therefore the internal energy is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=F. |last=Reif |title=Statistical Physics |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=London |date=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=C. |last1=Kittel |first2=H. |last2=Kroemer |title=Thermal Physics |publisher=Freeman |location=London |date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In basic [[chemistry]], experiments are often conducted at constant [[atmospheric pressure]], and the pressure-volume work represents an energy exchange with the atmosphere that cannot be accessed or controlled, so that Δ''H'' is the expression chosen for the [[heat of reaction]].

For a [[heat engine]] a change in its internal energy is the difference between the heat input and the [[Work (thermodynamics)#Pressure-volume work|pressure-volume work]] done by the working substance while a change in its enthalpy is the difference between the heat input and the work done by the engine:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theoretische Physik|last=Bartelmann|first=Matthias|publisher=Springer Spektrum|year=2015|isbn=978-3-642-54617-4|location=|pages=1106–1108|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dH=\delta Q-\delta W&lt;/math&gt; 
where the work W done by the engine is: 
:&lt;math&gt;W=-\oint pdV&lt;/math&gt;

== Relationship to heat ==
In order to discuss the relation between the enthalpy increase and heat supply, we return to the first law for closed systems: {{nowrap|1=''dU'' = ''δQ'' − ''δW''}}. We apply it to the special case with a uniform pressure at the surface. In this case the work term can be split into two contributions, the so-called ''pV'' work, given by {{nowrap|''p&amp;thinsp;dV''}} (where here ''p'' is the pressure at the surface, ''dV'' is the increase of the volume of the system) and all other types of work ''δW′'', such as by a shaft or by electromagnetic interaction. So we write {{nowrap|1=''δW'' = ''p&amp;thinsp;dV'' + ''δW′''}}. In this case the first law reads:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \delta Q - p\,dV - \delta W',&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;dH = \delta Q + V\,dp - \delta W'.&lt;/math&gt;

From this relation we see that the increase in enthalpy of a system is equal to the added [[heat]]:

:&lt;math&gt;dH = \delta Q,&lt;/math&gt;

provided that the system is under [[isobaric system|constant pressure]] (''dp''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) and that the only work done by the system is expansion work (''δW'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ebbing|first1=Darrel|last2=Gammon|first2=Steven|title=General Chemistry|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2010|isbn=978-0-538-49752-7|page=231|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_7iGj4QLR4C&amp;pg=PA231|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114033110/http://books.google.com/books?id=8_7iGj4QLR4C&amp;pg=PA231|archivedate=2013-11-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
In thermodynamics, one can calculate enthalpy by determining the requirements for creating a system from "nothingness"; the mechanical work required, ''pV'', differs based upon the conditions that obtain during the creation of the [[thermodynamic system]].

[[Energy]] must be supplied to remove particles from the surroundings to make space for the creation of the system, assuming that the pressure ''p'' remains constant; this is the ''pV'' term. The supplied energy must also provide the change in internal energy, ''U'', which includes [[activation energy|activation energies]], ionization energies, mixing energies, vaporization energies, chemical bond energies, and so forth. Together, these constitute the change in the enthalpy ''U''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''pV''. For systems at constant pressure, with no external work done other than the ''pV'' work, the change in enthalpy is the heat received by the system.

For a simple system, with a constant number of particles, the difference in enthalpy is the maximum amount of thermal energy derivable from a thermodynamic process in which the pressure is held constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rathakrishnan|title=High Enthalpy Gas Dynamics|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Singapore Pte. Ltd.|isbn=9781118821893|date=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat of reaction===
{{Main|Standard enthalpy of reaction}}
The total enthalpy of a system cannot be measured directly, the ''enthalpy change'' of a [[system (thermodynamics)|system]] is measured instead. Enthalpy change is defined by the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H = H_\mathrm{f} - H_\mathrm{i},&lt;/math&gt;

where
:Δ''H'' is the "enthalpy change",
:''H''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the final enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction, the enthalpy of the products),
:''H''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction, the enthalpy of the reactants).

For an [[exothermic reaction]] at constant [[pressure]], the system's change in enthalpy equals the energy released in the reaction, including the energy retained in the system and lost through expansion against its surroundings.  In a similar manner, for an [[endothermic]] reaction, the system's change in enthalpy is equal to the energy ''absorbed'' in the reaction, including the energy ''lost by'' the system and ''gained'' from compression from its surroundings. If Δ''H'' is positive, the reaction is endothermic, that is heat is absorbed by the system due to the products of the reaction having a greater enthalpy than the reactants.  On the other hand, if Δ''H'' is negative, the reaction is exothermic, that is the overall decrease in enthalpy is achieved by the generation of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Keith J. |last=Laidler |first2=John H.|last2=Meiser|date=1982 |title=Physical Chemistry |page=53 |isbn=978-0-8053-5682-3 |publisher=Benjamin/Cummings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the definition of enthalpy as &lt;math&gt;H = U + pV,&lt;/math&gt; the enthalpy change at constant pressure &lt;math&gt;\Delta H = \Delta U + p \Delta V.&lt;/math&gt; However for most chemical reactions, the work term &lt;math&gt;p \Delta V&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than the internal energy change &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt; which is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;\Delta H.&lt;/math&gt;  As an example, for the combustion of carbon monoxide 2 CO(g) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) → 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g), &lt;math&gt;\Delta H&lt;/math&gt; = –566.0 kJ and &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt; = –563.5 kJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ralph H. |last=Petrucci |first2=William S.|last2=Harwood |first3=F. Geoffrey|last3=Herring |date=2002 |title=General Chemistry |edition=8th |pages=237–8 |isbn=978-0-13-014329-7|publisher=Prentice Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the differences are so small, reaction enthalpies are often loosely described as reaction energies and analyzed in terms of [[bond energy|bond energies]].

===Specific enthalpy===
The specific enthalpy of a uniform system is defined as ''h'' = {{sfrac|''H''|''m''}} where ''m'' is the mass of the system. The [[SI unit]] for specific enthalpy is joule per kilogram. It can be expressed in other specific quantities by {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''u'' + ''pv''}}, where ''u'' is the specific [[internal energy]], ''p'' is the pressure, and ''v'' is [[specific volume]], which is equal to {{sfrac|''ρ''}}, where ''ρ'' is the [[density]].

===Enthalpy changes===
An enthalpy change describes the change in enthalpy observed in the constituents of a thermodynamic system when undergoing a transformation or chemical reaction. It is the difference between the enthalpy after the process has completed, i.e. the enthalpy of the [[Product (chemistry)|products]], and the initial enthalpy of the system, i.e. the reactants. These processes are reversible{{why|date=March 2015}} and the enthalpy for the reverse process is the negative value of the forward change.

A common standard enthalpy change is the [[enthalpy of formation]], which has been determined for a large number of substances. Enthalpy changes are routinely measured and compiled in chemical and physical reference works, such as the [[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]]. The following is a selection of enthalpy changes commonly recognized in thermodynamics.

When used in these recognized terms the qualifier ''change'' is usually dropped and the property is simply termed ''enthalpy of 'process'''. Since these properties are often used as reference values it is very common to quote them for a standardized set of environmental parameters, or [[standard conditions]], including: 
* A [[temperature]] of 25&amp;nbsp;°C or 298.15&amp;nbsp;K,
* A [[pressure]] of one atmosphere (1&amp;nbsp;atm or 101.325&amp;nbsp;kPa),
* A [[concentration]] of 1.0&amp;nbsp;M when the element or compound is present in solution,
* Elements or compounds in their normal physical states, i.e. [[standard state]].
For such standardized values the name of the enthalpy is commonly prefixed with the term ''standard'', e.g. ''standard enthalpy of formation''.

Chemical properties:
* [[Enthalpy of reaction]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of substance reacts completely.
* [[Enthalpy of formation]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a compound is formed from its elementary antecedents.
* [[Enthalpy of combustion]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a substance burns completely with oxygen.
* [[Enthalpy of hydrogenation]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of an unsaturated compound reacts completely with an excess of hydrogen to form a saturated compound.
* [[Enthalpy of atomization]], defined as the enthalpy change required to atomize one mole of compound completely.
*[[Enthalpy of neutralization]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of water is formed when an acid and a base react.
* Standard [[Enthalpy of solution]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a solute is dissolved completely in an excess of solvent, so that the solution is at infinite dilution.
* Standard enthalpy of [[Denaturation (biochemistry)]], defined as the enthalpy change required to denature one mole of compound.
* [[Hydration energy|Enthalpy of hydration]], defined as the enthalpy change observed when one mole of gaseous ions are completely dissolved in water forming one mole of aqueous ions.

Physical properties:
* [[Enthalpy of fusion]], defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between solid and liquid states.
* [[Enthalpy of vaporization]], defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between liquid and gaseous states.
* [[Enthalpy of sublimation]], defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between solid and gaseous states.
* [[Lattice enthalpy]], defined as the energy required to separate one mole of an ionic compound into separated gaseous ions to an infinite distance apart (meaning no force of attraction).
* [[Enthalpy of mixing]], defined as the enthalpy change upon mixing of two (non-reacting) chemical substances.

===Open systems===
In [[thermodynamic]] [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]], matter may flow in and out of the system boundaries. The first law of thermodynamics for open systems states: The increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by matter flowing in and by heating, minus the amount lost by matter flowing out and in the form of work done by the system:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \delta Q + dU_\text{in} - dU_\text{out} - \delta W,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''U''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; is the average internal energy entering the system, and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; is the average internal energy leaving the system.

[[Image:First law open system.svg|250px|thumb|right|During [[Steady-state (chemical engineering)|steady, continuous]] operation, an energy balance applied to an open system equates shaft work performed by the system to heat added plus net enthalpy added]]

The region of space enclosed by the boundaries of the open system is usually called a [[control volume]], and it may or may not correspond to physical walls.  If we choose the shape of the control volume such that all flow in or out occurs perpendicular to its surface, then the flow of matter into the system performs work as if it were a piston of fluid pushing mass into the system, and the system performs work on the flow of matter out as if it were driving a piston of fluid.  There are then two types of work performed: ''flow work'' described above, which is performed on the fluid (this is also often called ''pV work''), and ''shaft work'', which may be performed on some mechanical device.

These two types of work are expressed in the equation

: &lt;math&gt;\delta W = d(p_\text{out}V_\text{out}) - d(p_\text{in}V_\text{in}) + \delta W_\text{shaft}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution into the equation above for the control volume (cv) yields:

: &lt;math&gt;dU_\text{cv} = \delta Q + dU_\text{in} + d(p_\text{in}V_\text{in}) - dU_\text{out} - d(p_\text{out}V_\text{out}) - \delta W_\text{shaft}.&lt;/math&gt;

The definition of enthalpy, ''H'', permits us to use this [[thermodynamic potential]] to account for both internal energy and ''pV'' work in fluids for open systems:

: &lt;math&gt;dU_\text{cv} = \delta Q + dH_\text{in} - dH_\text{out} - \delta W_\text{shaft}.&lt;/math&gt;

If we allow also the system boundary to move (e.g. due to moving pistons), we get a rather general form of the first law for open systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=M. J. |last1=Moran |first2=H. N. |last2=Shapiro |title=Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics |edition=5th |date=2006 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of time derivatives it reads:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dt} = \sum_k \dot Q_k + \sum_k \dot H_k - \sum_k p_k\frac{dV_k}{dt} - P,&lt;/math&gt;

with sums over the various places ''k'' where heat is supplied, matter flows into the system, and boundaries are moving. The ''Ḣ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' terms represent enthalpy flows, which can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\dot H_k = h_k\dot m_k = H_m\dot n_k,&lt;/math&gt;

with ''ṁ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' the mass flow and ''ṅ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' the molar flow at position ''k'' respectively. The term {{sfrac|''dV''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;|''dt''}} represents the rate of change of the system volume at position ''k'' that results in ''pV'' power done by the system. The parameter ''P'' represents all other forms of power done by the system such as shaft power, but it can also be e.g. electric power produced by an electrical power plant.

Note that the previous expression holds true only if the kinetic energy flow rate is conserved between system inlet and outlet.{{clarify|reason=This new type of energy, kinetic energy, was not mentioned before. Is it part of U? Does it need to be conserved, or just the net flow across boundary be zero?|date=March 2015}} Otherwise, it has to be included in the enthalpy balance. During [[Steady-state (chemical engineering)|steady-state]] operation of a device (''see [[turbine]], [[pump]], and [[engine]]''), the average {{sfrac|''dU''|''dt''}} may be set equal to zero. This yields a useful expression for the average [[Power (physics)|power]] generation for these devices in the absence of chemical reactions:

:&lt;math&gt; P = \sum_k \left\langle \dot Q_k \right\rangle
+ \sum_k \left\langle \dot H_k \right\rangle
- \sum_k \left\langle p_k\frac{dV_k}{dt} \right\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[angle bracket]]s denote time averages. The technical importance of the enthalpy is directly related to its presence in the first law for open systems, as formulated above.

==Diagrams==
[[File:Ts diagram of N2 02.jpg|500px|thumb|right|''T''–''s'' diagram of nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;Figure composed with data obtained with RefProp, NIST Standard Reference Database 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The red curve at the left is the melting curve. The red dome represents the two-phase region with the low-entropy side the saturated liquid and the high-entropy side the saturated gas. The black curves give the ''T''–''s'' relation along isobars. The pressures are indicated in bar. The blue curves are isenthalps (curves of constant enthalpy). The values are indicated in blue in kJ/kg. The specific points '''a''', '''b''', etc., are treated in the main text.]]

The enthalpy values of important substances can be obtained using commercial software. Practically all relevant material properties can be obtained either in tabular or in graphical form. There are many types of diagrams, such as ''h''–''T'' diagrams, which give the specific enthalpy as function of temperature for various pressures, and ''h''–''p'' diagrams, which give ''h'' as function of ''p'' for various ''T''. One of the most common diagrams is the temperature–specific entropy diagram (''T''–''s''-diagram). It gives the melting curve and saturated liquid and vapor values together with isobars and isenthalps. These diagrams are powerful tools in the hands of the thermal engineer.

===Some basic applications===
The points '''a''' through '''h''' in the figure play a role in the discussion in this section.
:'''a''': ''T'' = 300&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 6.85&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 461&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg;
:'''b''': ''T'' = 380&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 2&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 6.85&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 530&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg;
:'''c''': ''T'' = 300&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 200&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 5.16&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 430&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg;
:'''d''': ''T'' = 270&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 6.79&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 430&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg;
:'''e''': ''T'' = 108&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 13&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 3.55&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 100&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg (saturated liquid at 13&amp;nbsp;bar);
:'''f''': ''T'' = 77.2&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 3.75&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 100&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg;
:'''g''': ''T'' = 77.2&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 2.83&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 28&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg (saturated liquid at 1&amp;nbsp;bar);
:'''h''': ''T'' = 77.2&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 5.41&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 230&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg (saturated gas at 1&amp;nbsp;bar);

===Throttling===
{{main|Joule–Thomson effect}}
[[File:Schematic of throttling.png|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of a throttling in the steady state. Fluid enters the system (dotted rectangle) at point 1 and leaves it at point 2. The mass flow is ''ṁ''.]]

One of the simple applications of the concept of enthalpy is the so-called throttling process, also known as [[Joule–Thomson effect|Joule-Thomson expansion]]. It concerns a steady adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance (valve, porous plug, or any other type of flow resistance) as shown in the figure. This process is very important, since it is at the heart of domestic refrigerators, where it is responsible for the temperature drop between ambient temperature and the interior of the refrigerator. It is also the final stage in many types of liquefiers.

For a steady state flow regime, the enthalpy of the system (dotted rectangle) has to be constant. Hence

:&lt;math&gt;0 = \dot m h_1 - \dot m h_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the mass flow is constant, the specific enthalpies at the two sides of the flow resistance are the same:

:&lt;math&gt;h_1 = h_2,&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the enthalpy per unit mass does not change during the throttling. The consequences of this relation can be demonstrated using the ''T''–''s'' diagram above. Point '''c''' is at 200&amp;nbsp;bar and room temperature (300&amp;nbsp;K). A Joule–Thomson expansion from 200&amp;nbsp;bar to 1&amp;nbsp;bar follows a curve of constant enthalpy of roughly 425&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg (not shown in the diagram) lying between the 400 and 450&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg isenthalps and ends in point '''d''', which is at a temperature of about 270&amp;nbsp;K. Hence the expansion from 200&amp;nbsp;bar to 1&amp;nbsp;bar cools nitrogen from 300&amp;nbsp;K to 270&amp;nbsp;K. In the valve, there is a lot of friction, and a lot of entropy is produced, but still the final temperature is below the starting value!

Point '''e''' is chosen so that it is on the saturated liquid line with {{nowrap|1=''h'' = 100 kJ/kg}}. It corresponds roughly with {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 13 bar}} and {{nowrap|1=''T'' = 108 K}}. Throttling from this point to a pressure of 1&amp;nbsp;bar ends in the two-phase region (point '''f'''). This means that a mixture of gas and liquid leaves the throttling valve. Since the enthalpy is an extensive parameter, the enthalpy in '''f''' (''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;) is equal to the enthalpy in '''g''' (''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''g'''&lt;/sub&gt;) multiplied by the liquid fraction in '''f''' (''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;) plus the enthalpy in '''h''' (''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''h'''&lt;/sub&gt;) multiplied by the gas fraction in '''f''' {{nowrap|(1 − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. So

:&lt;math&gt; h_\mathbf{f} = x_\mathbf{f} h_\mathbf{g} + (1 - x_\mathbf{f})h_\mathbf{h}.&lt;/math&gt;

With numbers: {{nowrap|1=100 = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt; × 28 + (1 − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;) × 230}}, so ''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.64. This means that the mass fraction of the liquid in the liquid–gas mixture that leaves the throttling valve is 64%.

===Compressors===
{{main|Gas compressor}}
[[File:Schematic of compressor.png|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of a compressor in the steady state. Fluid enters the system (dotted rectangle) at point 1 and leaves it at point 2. The mass flow is ''ṁ''. A power ''P'' is applied and a heat flow ''Q̇'' is released to the surroundings at ambient temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

A power ''P'' is applied e.g. as electrical power. If the compression is [[adiabatic]], the gas temperature goes up. In the reversible case it would be at constant entropy, which corresponds with a vertical line in the ''T''–''s'' diagram. For example, compressing nitrogen from 1 bar (point '''a''') to 2 bar (point '''b''') would result in a temperature increase from 300 K to 380 K. In order to let the compressed gas exit at ambient temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, heat exchange, e.g. by cooling water, is necessary. In the ideal case the compression is isothermal. The average heat flow to the surroundings is ''Q̇''. Since the system is in the steady state the first law gives

:&lt;math&gt;0 = -\dot Q + \dot m h_1 - \dot m h_2 + P.&lt;/math&gt;

The minimal power needed for the compression is realized if the compression is reversible. In that case the [[second law of thermodynamics]] for open systems gives

:&lt;math&gt;0 = -\frac{\dot Q}{T_\mathrm{a}} + \dot m s_1 - \dot m s_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Eliminating ''Q̇'' gives for the minimal power

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_\text{min}}{\dot m} = h_2 - h_1 - T_\mathrm{a}(s_2 - s_1).&lt;/math&gt;

For example, compressing 1&amp;nbsp;kg of nitrogen from 1&amp;nbsp;bar to 200&amp;nbsp;bar costs at least {{nowrap|1=(''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''c'''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;/sub&gt;) − ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(''s''&lt;sub&gt;'''c'''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''s''&lt;sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. With the data, obtained with the ''T''–''s'' diagram, we find a value of {{nowrap|1=(430 − 461) − 300 × (5.16 − 6.85) =}} 476&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg.

The relation for the power can be further simplified by writing it as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_\text{min}}{\dot m} = \int_1^2(dh - T_\mathrm{a}\,ds).&lt;/math&gt;

With {{nowrap|1=''dh'' = ''T''&amp;thinsp;''ds'' + ''v''&amp;thinsp;''dp''}}, this results in the final relation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_\text{min}}{\dot m} = \int_1^2 v\,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

An '''entity''' is something that [[Existence|exists]] as itself, as a subject or as an object, actually or potentially, concretely or abstractly, physically or not.  It need not be of material existence. In particular, [[abstraction]]s and [[legal fiction]]s are usually regarded as entities. In general, there is also no presumption that an entity is [[Life|animate]], or [[present]].

The word is abstract in intention. It may refer, for example, to [[Bucephalus]], the horse of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]; to a stone; to a [[cardinal number]]; to a language; or to [[ghost]]s or other [[spirit]]s.

The word ''entitative'' is the adjective form of the noun entity. Something that is entitative is considered in its own right.

== In philosophy ==
{{Main article|Ontology}}
Ontology is the study of being, existence and the recognition of entities. The words ontic and entity are derived respectively from the ancient Greek and Latin present participles that mean "[[being]]".

== In law ==
{{Main article|Legal person}}
In [[law]], a legal entity is an entity that is capable of bearing legal [[rights]] and [[obligation]]s, such as a [[natural person]] or an [[Legal person|artificial person]] (e.g. business entity or a corporate entity).

== In politics ==
{{Main article|Polity}}
In [[politics]], ''entity'' is used as term for territorial divisions of some countries (e.g. [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]).

== In medicine ==
{{Main article|Medicine}}
In [[medicine]], a disease entity is an illness due to a particular definite cause or to a specific pathological process. While a disease entity is not defined by a [[syndrome]], it may or may not be manifest in one or more particular syndromes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3693">'''Environmental virtue ethics''' (EVE) is, as the name suggests, a way of approaching [[environmental ethics]] through the lens of [[virtue ethics]]. It is paradoxically both a very new and a relatively old or established approach. It is old or established because, as Louke Van Wensveen points out, almost all environmental literature employs virtue language.&lt;ref name="Wensveen, 2000"&gt;Louke van Wensveen, ''Dirty Virtues: The Emergence of Ecological Virtue Ethics'' (Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; It is new because it is only recently that this tendency to use virtue-laden language has been taken up explicitly and addressed through the lens of philosophical virtue ethics.

Early interest in applying virtue theory to environmental problems can be found in disparate articles in academic and environmental journals, such as Thomas Hill's "Ideals of Human Excellence and Preserving Natural Environments."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Hill, "Ideals of Human Excellence and Preserving Natural Environments," ''Environmental Ethics'' 5 (fall 1983):211-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The first major analysis of this approach is Louke Van Wensveen’s influential book ''Dirty Virtues: The Emergence of Ecological Virtue Ethics''.&lt;ref name="Wensveen, 2000"/&gt;

Environmental virtue ethicists take inspiration for a variety of schools of virtue ethics and from diverse backgrounds in environmental ethics. Nevertheless, there are three general approaches to identifying virtues and vices within EVE. First, the "virtue theory approach," which attempts to build an environmental virtue ethics from the ground up. Second, the "environmental exemplar approach," which looks to people who are generally considered to be environmentally virtuous as models. And, finally, the "extensionist approach," which takes traditional virtues and extends them to operate in an environmentally meaningful way.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Sandler, ''Character and Environment: A Virtue-Oriented Approach to Environmental Ethics'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 2007), 10-11).&lt;/ref&gt; While some authors take one of these approaches, others combine elements from two or more. 

Typical EVE topics include: the explication of specific virtues or vices; the analysis of specific exemplars who embody one or more of the virtues; the attempt to weigh in on specific environmental problems from the perspective of virtue ethics, including offering rules (“v-rules”) for conduct or making actual policy recommendations; and, of course, arguing for the theoretical foundation and legitimacy of the virtue-theory approach to environmental ethics.

'''Ergative–absolutive languages''', or '''ergative languages''' are languages that share a certain distinctive pattern relating to the [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] (technically, [[verb argument|arguments]]) of verbs. Examples are [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Mayan languages|Mayan]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] and several [[Indo-European languages]], such as the [[Kurdish languages]] including [[Gorani language (Zaza-Gorani)|Gorani]]. 

In an ergative language, the single argument ("[[subject (grammar)|subject]]") of an [[intransitive verb]] behaves like the [[object (grammar)|object]] of a transitive verb, and differently from the [[agent (grammar)|agent]] of a [[transitive verb]].&lt;ref&gt;Comrie (1989), p. 110ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

That is in contrast to [[Nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] languages, such as [[English language|English]] and most other Indo-European languages, where the single argument of an intransitive verb ("She" in the sentence "She walks.") behaves grammatically like the agent of a transitive verb ("She" in the sentence "She finds it.") but differently from the object of a transitive verb ("him" in the sentence "She likes him.").

In ergative–absolutive languages with [[grammatical case]], the case used for the single argument of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb is the [[absolutive case|absolutive]], and the case used for the agent of a transitive verb is the [[ergative case|ergative]]. In nominative–accusative languages, the case for the single argument of an intransitive verb and the agent of a transitive verb is the [[nominative case|nominative]] while the case for the direct object of a transitive verb is the [[accusative case|accusative]]. 

There is a variant group, the [[Tripartite language|ergative-accusative languages]] (such as [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]]), which function ergatively with respect to nouns but are nominative-accusative with pronouns.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert M. W. Dixon]], ''Searching for Aboriginal Languages:Memoirs of a Field Worker,'' Cambridge University Press 2011 p.163&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--He says that Dyirbal is nominative-accusative with pronouns, but he doesn't call that pattern "ergative-accusative"--&gt;{{dubious|date=November 2018}}

==Ergative vs. accusative languages==

An ergative language maintains a [[syntax|syntactic]] or [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] equivalence (such as the same [[word order]] or [[grammatical case]]) for the object of a transitive verb and the single core argument of an intransitive verb, while treating the agent of a transitive verb differently.

This contrasts with [[Nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] languages such as [[English language|English]], where the single [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]] of an intransitive verb and the [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] of a transitive verb (both called the [[subject (grammar)|subject]]) are treated alike and kept distinct from the object of a transitive verb.

{{multiple image

{{Clear|left}}

(reference for figure:  &lt;ref&gt;Friend, Some Syntactic and Morphological Features of Suleimaniye Kurdish, UCLA, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;)

These different arguments are usually symbolized as follows:
* '''A''' = agent of transitive verb
* '''O''' = object of transitive verb (also symbolized as '''P''' for "patient")
* '''S''' = core argument of intransitive verb

The relationship between ergative and accusative systems can be schematically represented as the following:

{| class="wikitable" cellpadding="5"
!
! Ergative–absolutive
! Nominative–accusative
|-
| '''A'''
| &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;ERG&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;NOM&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| '''O'''
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;ABS&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;ACC&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| '''S'''
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;ABS&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;NOM&lt;/span&gt;
|}

''See [[morphosyntactic alignment]] for a more technical explanation and a comparison with [[nominative–accusative language]]s.''

Note that the word ''subject'', as it is typically defined in grammars of nominative–accusative languages, has a different application when referring to ergative–absolutive languages, or when discussing [[morphosyntactic alignment]] in general.

Ergative languages tend to be either verb-final or verb-initial; there are few, if any, ergative [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]]-languages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~asw/lab/lab87/LAB87_lahne.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Realization of ergativity==
Ergativity can be found in both [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and [[syntactic]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;For a kind of "phonological" ergativity, see Rude (1983), also Vydrin (2011) for a detailed critique.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphological ergativity===
If the language has morphological [[grammatical case|case]], then the [[verb argument]]s are marked thus:
* The agent of a transitive verb ('''A''') is marked as [[ergative case]], or as a similar case such as [[oblique case|oblique]].
* The core argument of an intransitive verb ('''S''') and the object of a transitive verb ('''O''') are both marked with [[absolutive case]].&lt;ref&gt;Friend, Some Syntactic and Morphological Features of Suleimaniye Kurdish, UCLA, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is no case marking, ergativity can be marked through other means, such as in verbal morphology. For instance, [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] and most [[Mayan languages]] have no morphological ergative case, but they have a verbal agreement structure that is ergative. In languages with ergative–absolutive agreement systems, the absolutive form is usually the most [[markedness|unmarked]] form of a word (exceptions include [[Nias language|Nias]] and [[Tlapanec language|Tlapanec]]&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, Mark (2008). "Semantic alignment systems: what's what, and what's not". In Donohue, Mark &amp; Søren Wichmann, eds. (2008). ''The Typology of Semantic Alignment''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The following examples from [[Basque language|Basque]] demonstrate an ergative–absolutive case marking system:

| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''S'''&lt;/span&gt;

| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;'''A'''&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''O'''&lt;/span&gt;

|}

Here "-Ø" represents a [[Null morpheme|zero morpheme]], as the absolutive case is unmarked in Basque. The forms for the ergative are "-k" after a vowel, and "-ek" after a consonant. It is a further rule in Basque grammar that in most cases a noun phrase must be closed by a [[determiner]]. The default determiner (commonly called the [[Article (grammar)|article]], which is suffixed to [[Noun|common nouns]] and usually translatable by "the" in English) is "-a" in the singular and "-ak" in the plural, the plural being marked only on the determiner and never the noun. For common nouns, this default determiner is fused with the ergative case marker. Thus one obtains the following forms for "gizon" ("man" in English): gizon-a (man-the.sing.abs), gizon-ak (man-the.pl.abs), gizon-ak (man-the.sing.erg), gizon-ek (man-the.pl.erg). Note that when fused with the article, the absolutive plural is [[Homophony|homophonous]] with the ergative singular. See [[Basque grammar]] for details.&lt;ref&gt;King, Alan R. ''The Basque Language: A Practical Introduction.'' Reno: University of Nevada Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is a nominative–accusative language:

{| class="wikitable"
! colspan="7" align="center" | Accusative language
|-
! Sentence:
| colspan="2" | ''Otoko ga tsuita.''
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

| otoko &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''ga'''&lt;/span&gt;

| otoko &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''ga'''&lt;/span&gt;
| kodomo &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;'''o'''&lt;/span&gt;
| mita
|-

| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| man &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''&lt;small&gt;NOM&lt;/small&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;
| child &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;'''&lt;small&gt;ACC&lt;/small&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;
| saw
|-
! Function:
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''S'''&lt;/span&gt;
| VERB&lt;sub&gt;intrans&lt;/sub&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''A'''&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;'''O'''&lt;/span&gt;
| VERB&lt;sub&gt;trans&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
! Translation:
| colspan="2" | "The man arrived."
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| colspan="3" | "The man saw the child."
|}

In this language, the argument of the intransitive and agent of the transitive sentence are marked with the same [[nominative case]] particle ''ga'', while the object of the transitive sentence is marked with the [[accusative case]] o.

If one sets: A = agent of a transitive verb; S = argument of an intransitive verb; O = object of a transitive verb, then we can contrast normal nominative–accusative English with a hypothetical ergative English:

Accusative English:

:He (A) found me (O).

:He (S) traveled.

(S form = A form)

Hypothetical ergative English:

:He (A) found me (O).

:Him (S) traveled.

(S form = O form)

A number of languages have both ergative and accusative morphology. A typical example is a language that has nominative–accusative marking on verbs and ergative–absolutive case marking on nouns.

[[Georgian language|Georgian]] also has an ergative alignment, but the agent is only marked with the ergative case in the [[perfective]] aspect (also known as the "aorist [[screeve]]"). Compare:

: ''K'ac'i vašls č'ams.'' (''კაცი ვაშლს ჭამს'') "The man is eating an apple."
:''K'ac''''ma''' vašli č'ama.'' (''კაცმა ვაშლი ჭამა'') "The man ate an apple."

''K'ac'-'' is the root of the word "man". In the first sentence (present continuous tense) the agent is in the nominative case ''(k'ac'i).'' In the second sentence, which shows ergative alignment, the root is marked with the ergative suffix ''-ma''.

However, there are some intransitive verbs in Georgian that behave like transitive verbs, and therefore employ the ergative case in the past tense. Consider:

:''K'ac''''ma''' daacemina.'' (''კაცმა დააცემინა'') "The man sneezed."

Although the verb ''sneeze'' is clearly intransitive, it is conjugated like a transitive verb. In Georgian there are a few verbs like these, and there has not been a clear-cut explanation as to why these verbs have evolved this way. One explanation is that verbs such as "sneeze" used to have a direct object (the object being "nose" in the case of "sneeze") and over time lost these objects, yet kept their transitive behavior.

===Syntactic ergativity===
Ergativity may be manifested through syntax, such as saying “Arrived I” for “I arrived”, in addition to morphology. Syntactic ergativity is quite rare, and while all languages that exhibit it also feature morphological ergativity, few morphologically ergative languages have ergative syntax. As with morphology, syntactic ergativity can be placed on a continuum, whereby certain syntactic operations may pattern accusatively and others ergatively. The degree of syntactic ergativity is then dependent on the number of syntactic operations that treat the subject like the object. Syntactic ergativity is also referred to as inter-clausal ergativity, as it typically appears in the relation of two clauses.

Syntactic ergativity may appear in:
* [[Word order]] (for example, the absolutive argument comes before the verb and the ergative argument comes after it)
* [[Syntactic pivot]]s
* [[Relative clause]]s – determining which arguments are available for relativization
* [[Subordination (linguistics)|Subordination]]
* [[Switch reference]]

====Example====

Example of syntactic ergativity in the "[[conjunction reduction]]" construction ([[coordinated clause]]s) in [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]] in contrast with English conjunction reduction. (The subscript (i) indicates coreference.)

[[English language|English]] ([[Agent–verb–object|SVO]] word order):
# Father returned.
# Father saw mother.
# Mother saw father.
# Father&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; returned and father&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; saw mother.
# Father returned and ____&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; saw mother.
# Father&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; returned and mother saw father&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;.
#* Father returned and mother saw ____&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;. (ill-formed, because S and deleted O cannot be [[coreference|coreferential]].)

[[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]] ([[Object–subject–verb|OSV]] word order):
# Ŋuma banagan&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;u. (''Father returned.'')
# Yabu ŋumaŋgu buṛan. (lit. ''Mother father-''ŋgu'' saw'', i.e. ''Father saw mother.'')
# Ŋuma yabuŋgu buṛan. (lit. ''Father mother-''ŋgu'' saw'', i.e. ''Mother saw father.'')
# Ŋuma&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; banagan&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;u, yabu ŋumaŋgu&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; buṛan. (lit. ''Father''&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;'' returned, mother father-''ŋgu&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;'' saw'', i.e. ''Father returned, father saw mother.'')
#* Ŋuma&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; banagan&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;u, yabu ____&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; buṛan. (lit. *''Father''&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;'' returned, mother ____''&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;'' saw''; ill-formed, because S and deleted A cannot be coreferential.)
# Ŋuma&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; banagan&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;u, ŋuma&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; yabuŋgu buṛan. (lit. ''Father''&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;'' returned, father''&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;'' mother-''ŋgu'' saw'', i.e. ''Father returned, mother saw father.'')
# Ŋuma&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; banagan&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;u, ____&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt; yabuŋgu buṛan. (lit. ''Father''&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;'' returned, ____''&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;'' mother-''ŋgu'' saw'', i.e. ''Father returned, mother saw father.'')

===Split ergativity===
{{main|Split ergativity}}
The term ''ergative–absolutive'' is considered unsatisfactory by some, since there are very few languages without any patterns that exhibit [[nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative alignment]]. Instead they posit that one should only speak of ''ergative–absolutive systems'', which languages employ to different degrees.

Many languages classified as ergative in fact show '''split ergativity''', whereby syntactic and/or morphological ergative patterns are conditioned by the grammatical context, typically person or the tense/aspect of the verb. [[Basque language|Basque]] is unusual in having an almost fully ergative system in case-marking and verbal [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]], though it shows thoroughly nominative–accusative [[Morphosyntactic alignment|syntactic alignment]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iker.cnrs.fr/IMG/pdf/agreementbasque1.pdf. Retrieved 5 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and [[Hindi]], the ergative case is marked on agents in the [[preterite]] and [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] tenses for transitive and [[ditransitive verb]]s, while in other situations agents appear in the nominative case.

:''laṛkā kitāb kharīdtā hai''
:&lt;tt&gt;boy-NOMINATIVE-MASCULINE book-NOMINATIVE-FEMININE buy-IMPERFECT-MASCULINE be-PRESENT&lt;/tt&gt; ¹
:"The boy buys a book."

:''laṛke ne kitāb kharīdī''
:&lt;tt&gt;boy-ERGATIVE-MASCULINE book-NOMINATIVE-FEMININE buy-PERFECT-FEMININE&lt;/tt&gt; ¹
:"The boy bought a book."

::''(¹) The grammatical analysis has been simplified to show the features relevant to the example.''


In the Northern Kurdish language [[Kurmanji]], the ergative case is marked on agents and verbs of transitive verbs in past tenses, for the events actually occurred in the past. Present, future and "future in the past" tenses show no ergative mark neither for agents nor the verbs. For example:
:(1) Ez diçim. (I go)
:(2) Ez wî dibînim. (I see him.)
:(3) Ew diçe. (He goes)
:(4) Ew min dibîne. (He sees me.)

but:
:(5) Ez çûm. (I went)
:(6) Min ew dît. (I saw him.)
:(7) Ew çû. (He went.)
:(8) Wî ez dîtim. (He saw me.)

In sentences (1) to (4), there is no ergativity (transitive and intransitive verbs alike). In sentences (6) and (8), the ergative case is marked on agents and verbs.  

In [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], pronouns are morphologically nominative–accusative when the agent is first or second person, but ergative when the agent is a third person.

===Optional ergativity===

Many languages with ergative marking display what is known as ''optional ergativity'', where the ergative marking is not always expressed in all situations. McGregor (2010) gives a range of contexts when we often see optional ergativity, and argues that the choice is often not truly ''optional'' but is affected by [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]]. Note that unlike [[split ergativity]], which occurs regularly but in limited locations, optional ergativity can occur in a range of environments, but may not be used in a way that appears regular or consistent.

Optional ergativity may be motivated by:
* The [[animacy]] of the subject, with more ''animate'' subjects more likely to be marked ergative
* The [[semantics]] of the verb, with more ''active'' or ''transitive'' verbs more likely to be marked ergative
* The [[grammatical structure]] or [tense-aspect-mood]

Languages from Australia, New Guinea and Tibet have been shown to have optional ergativity.&lt;ref&gt;McGregor (2010) Optional ergative case marking systems in a typological-semiotic perspective. ''Lingua'' 120: 1610–1636&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution of ergative languages==
Prototypical ergative languages are, for the most part, restricted to specific regions of world: the [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]), [[Caucasus]], [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|the Americas]], the [[Tibetan Plateau]], and [[Australia]] and parts of [[New Guinea]].

Some specific languages are the following:

'''Americas'''
* [[Chibchan languages]]
* [[Chinook languages]]
* [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskaleut languages]]
* [[Guaicuruan languages]]
* [[Macro-Je languages]]
* [[Mayan languages|Mayan]]
* [[Mixe–Zoque languages|Mixe–Zoque]]
* [[Panoan languages]]
* [[Tsimshian languages|Tsimshian]]

'''Africa'''
* [[Päri language|Päri]], although recent studies imply a nominative-accusative system.&lt;ref&gt;Ergativity, by R. M. W. Dixon, Cambridge Studies in Linguistics, vol. 69, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Australian'''
* Most [[Australian Aboriginal languages]], such as [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]]
Certain [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] (e.g., [[Wangkumara]]) possess an [[intransitive case]] and an [[accusative case]] along with an ergative case, and lack an [[absolutive case]]; such languages are called [[ergative–accusative language]]s or [[tripartite language]]s.

'''Sign languages''' −− (for example, [[Nepalese Sign Language#NSL Morhosyntax|Nepali Sign Language]]) should also generally be considered ergative in the patterning of [[Actant#In linguistics|actant]] incorporation in verbs.&lt;ref&gt;MW Morgan (2009) Cross-Linguistic Typology of Argument Encoding in Sign Language Verbal Morphology. Paper presented at Association of Linguistic Typology, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sign language]]s that have been studied, [[classifier handshape]]s are incorporated into verbs, indicating the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of [[intransitive verb]]s when incorporated, and the [[Object (grammar)|object]] of [[transitive verb]]s. (If we follow the "[[Semantic Phonology]]" model proposed by [[William Stokoe]] (1991)&lt;ref&gt;William Stokoe (1991) Semantic Phonology. Sign Language Studies, 71 ,107–114.&lt;/ref&gt; this ergative-absolutive patterning also works at the level of the lexicon: thus in [[Nepali Sign Language]] the sign for TEA has the motion for the verb DRINK with a [[manual alphabet]] handshape च /ca/ (standing for the first letter of the [[Nepali language|Nepali]] word TEA चिया /chiya:/) being incorporated as the [[Object (grammar)|object]].)

Many other languages have limited ergativity. In both [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Hindi]] ([[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]), ergative behavior occurs only in the [[preterite]] and [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] tenses, and in the [[Georgian language|Georgian]], ergativity only occurs in the [[perfective]].

The [[Philippine languages]] (e.g., [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]) are sometimes considered ergative (Schachter 1976, 1977; Kroeger 1993), however they have also been considered to have their own unique morphosyntactic alignment. See [[Austronesian alignment]].

Several scholars have hypothesized that [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] was an ergative language. However, this hypothesis is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bavant |first=Marc |title=Proto-Indo-European Ergativity... Still To Be Discussed |journal=Poznań Studies in Contemporary Linguistics |year=2008 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=433–447 |doi=10.2478/v10010-008-0022-y |url=http://versita.metapress.com/content/r26389132nk67172/fulltext.pdf |accessdate=20 April 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approximations of ergativity in English==

English has derivational morphology that parallels ergativity in that it operates on intransitive verbs and objects of transitive verbs. With certain intransitive verbs, adding the suffix "-ee" to the verb produces a label for the person performing the action:

:"John has retired" → "John is a retiree"
:"John has escaped" → "John is an escapee"

However, with a transitive verb, adding "-ee" does not produce a label for the person doing the action. Instead, it gives us a label for the person to whom the action is done:

:"Susie employs Mike" → "Mike is an employee"
:"Mike has appointed Susie" → "Susie is an appointee"

Etymologically, the sense in which "-ee" denotes the object of a transitive verb is the original one, arising from French [[past participle]]s in "-é". This is still the prevalent sense in [[British English]]: the intransitive uses are all 19th-century American coinages and all except "escapee" are still marked as "chiefly U.S." by the "[[Oxford English Dictionary]]".

English also has a number of so-called [[ergative verb]]s, where the object of the verb when transitive is equivalent to the subject of the verb when intransitive.

When English nominalizes a clause, the underlying subject of an intransitive verb and the underlying object of a transitive verb are both marked with the possessive case or with the preposition "of" (the choice depends on the type and length of the noun: pronouns and short nouns are typically marked with the possessive, while long and complex NPs are marked with "of"). The underlying subject of a transitive is marked differently (typically with "by" as in a passive construction):

:"(a dentist) extracts a tooth" → "the extraction of a tooth (by a dentist)"
:"(I/The editor) revised the essay" → "(my/the editor's) revision of the essay"
:"(I was surprised that) the water boiled" → "(I was surprised at) the boiling of the water"
:"I departed on time (so I could catch the plane)" → "My timely departure (allowed me to catch the plane)"

'''Event correlation''' is a technique for making sense of a large number of events and pinpointing the few events that are really important in that mass of information. This is accomplished by looking for and analyzing relationships between events.

==History==

Event correlation has been used in various fields for many years:

:* since the 1970s, [[telecommunications]] and [[Industrial process|industrial process control]];
:* since the 1980s, [[network management]] and [[systems management]];
:* since the 1990s, [[IT service management]], [[Publish–subscribe pattern|publish-subscribe systems]] (pub/sub), [[Complex Event Processing]] (CEP) and [[Security Information and Event Management]] (SIEM);
:* since the early 2000s, [[Distributed Event-Based Systems]] and [[Business Activity Monitoring]] (BAM).

==Examples and application domains==

Integrated management is traditionally subdivided into various fields:

:* layer by layer: [[network management]], [[system management]], [[Service Level Management|service management]], etc.
:* by management function: [[performance management]], [[security management]], etc.

Event correlation takes place in different components depending on the field of study:

:* Within the field of [[network management]], event correlation is performed in a management platform typically known as a [[Network management station|Network Management Station]] or [[Network management system|Network Management System]] (NMS). For example, events may notify that a device has just rebooted or that a network link is currently down.

:* Within the field of [[systems management]], an event may for instance report that the CPU utilization of an e-business server has been at 100% for over 15 minutes.

:* Within the field of [[Service Level Management|service management]], an event may notify that a [[Service level objective|Service-Level Objective]] is not met for a given customer, for example.

:* Within the field of [[security management]], the management platform is usually known as the [[Security Information and Event Management]] (SIEM), and event correlation is often performed in a separate correlation engine. That engine may directly receive events in real time, or it may read them from SIEM storage. In this case, examples of monitored events include activity such as authentication, access to services and data, and output from point security tools such as an [[Intrusion detection system|Intrusion Detection System]] (IDS) or [[antivirus software]].

In this article, we focus on event correlation in integrated management and provide links to other fields.

The goal of ''integrated management'' is to integrate the management of networks (data, telephone and multimedia), systems (servers, databases and applications) and IT services in a coherent manner. The scope of this discipline notably includes [[network management]], [[systems management]] and [[Service level management|Service-Level Management]].

===Events and event correlator===

Event correlation usually takes place inside one or several management platforms. It is implemented by a piece of software known as the '''event correlator'''. This component is automatically fed with events originating from managed elements (applications, devices), monitoring tools, the [[Trouble ticket system|Trouble Ticket System]], etc. Each event captures something special (from the event source standpoint) that happened in the domain of interest to the event correlator, which will vary depending upon the type of analysis the correlator is attempting to perform.

The event correlator plays a key role in integrated management, for only within it do events from many disparate sources come together and allow for comparison across sources. For instance, this is where the failure of a service can be ascribed to a specific failure in the underlying [[IT infrastructure]], or where the root cause of a potential security attack can be identified.

Most event correlators can receive events from [[trouble ticket system]]s. However, only some of them are able to notify trouble ticket systems when a problem is solved, which partly explains the difficulty for [[Service Desk (ITSM)|Service Desk]]s to keep updated with the latest news. In theory, the integration of management in organizations requires the communication between the event correlator and the trouble ticket system to work both ways.

An event may convey an alarm or report an incident (which explains why event correlation used to be called '''alarm correlation'''), but not necessarily. It may also report that a situation goes back to normal, or simply send some information that it deems relevant (e.g., policy P has been updated on device D). The '''severity''' of the event is an indication given by the event source to the event destination of the priority that this event should be given while being processed.

===Step-by-step decomposition===

Event correlation can be decomposed into four steps: event filtering, event aggregation, event masking and root cause analysis. A fifth step (action triggering) is often associated with event correlation and therefore briefly mentioned here.

====Event filtering====

'''Event filtering''' consists in discarding events that are deemed to be irrelevant by the event correlator. For instance, a number of bottom-of-the-range devices are difficult to configure and occasionally send events of no interest to the management platform (e.g., printer P needs A4 paper in tray 1). Another example is the filtering of informational or debugging events by an event correlator that is only interested in availability and faults.

====Event aggregation====

'''Event aggregation''' is a technique where multiple events that are very similar (but not necessarily identical) are combined into an aggregate that represents the underlying event data. Its main objective is to summarize a collection of input events into a smaller collection that can be processed using various [[analytics]] methods. For example, the aggregate may provide statistical summaries of the underlying events and the resources that are affected by those events. Another example is temporal aggregation, when the same problem is reported over and over again by the event source, until the problem is finally solved.

'''Event de-duplication''' is a special type of event aggregation that consists in merging exact duplicates of the same event. Such duplicates may be caused by network instability (e.g., the same event is sent twice by the event source because the first instance was not acknowledged sufficiently quickly, but both instances eventually reach the event destination).

====Event masking====

'''Event masking''' (also known as ''topological masking'' in [[network management]]) consists of ignoring events pertaining to systems that are downstream of a failed system.  For example, servers that are downstream of a crashed router will fail availability polling.

====Root cause analysis====

'''[[Root cause analysis]]''' is the last and most complex step of event correlation. It consists of analyzing dependencies between events, based for instance on a model of the environment and dependency graphs, to detect whether some events can be explained by others. For example, if database D runs on server S and this server gets durably overloaded (CPU used at 100% for a long time), the event “the SLA for database D is no longer fulfilled” can be explained by the event “Server S is durably overloaded”.

====Action triggering====

At this stage, the event correlator is left with at most a handful of events that need to be acted upon. Strictly speaking, event correlation ends here. However, by language abuse, the event correlators found on the market (e.g., in [[network management]]) sometimes also include problem-solving capabilities. For instance, they may trigger corrective actions or further investigations automatically.

==Event correlation in other fields==

===Event correlation in ITIL===

The scope of [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library|ITIL]] (the ''Information Technology Infrastructure Library'') is larger than that of integrated management. However, event correlation in ITIL is quite similar to event correlation in integrated management.

In the ITIL version 2 framework, event correlation spans three processes: Incident Management, Problem Management and Service Level Management.

In the ITIL version 3 framework, event correlation takes place in the Event Management process. The event correlator is called a ''correlation engine''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6479">'''Flooding''', sometimes referred to as '''in vivo exposure therapy''', is a form of [[behavior therapy]] and [[desensitization (medicine)|desensitization]]&amp;mdash;or [[exposure therapy]]&amp;mdash;based on the principles of [[respondent conditioning]]. As a [[psychotherapeutic]] technique, it is used to treat [[phobia]] and anxiety disorders including [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. It works by exposing the patient to their painful memories,&lt;ref name="sundel"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sundel |first=Martin |author2=Stone-Sundel, Sandra |title=Behavior Change in the Human Services |publisher=SAGE |year=2005 |pages=241–2 |isbn=978-0-7619-8870-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNtp3xtSGC8C&amp;pg=PA241&amp;dq=Flooding+phobia&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA241,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of reintegrating their [[psychological repression|repressed]] emotions with their current awareness. Flooding was invented by [[psychologist]] [[Thomas Stampfl]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leitenberg |first=Harold |title=Handbook of Social and Evaluation Anxiety |publisher=Springer |year=1990 |pages=300–2 |isbn=978-0-306-43438-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6GpO2ZrltgC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;dq=Flooding+phobia&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA302,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still used in [[behavior therapy]] today.

Flooding is a psychotherapeutic method for overcoming phobias. This is a faster method of ridding fears when compared with [[systematic desensitization]]. In order to demonstrate the irrationality of the fear, a psychologist would put a person in a situation where they would face their phobia at its worst. Under controlled conditions and using psychologically-proven relaxation techniques, the subject attempts to replace their fear with relaxation. The experience can often be traumatic for a person, but may be necessary if the phobia is causing them significant life disturbances. The advantage to flooding is that it is quick and usually effective. There is, however, a possibility that a fear may spontaneously recur. This can be made less likely with systematic desensitization, another form of a classical condition procedure for the elimination of phobias.&lt;ref name="Kosslyn, Stephen M. 2007"&gt;Kosslyn, Stephen M.; Rosenberg, Robin S. (2007) ''Fundamentals of Psychology In Context''. Boston: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
"Flooding" is an effective form of treatment for phobias amongst other psychopathologies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} It works on the principles of [[classical conditioning]] or [[respondent conditioning]]—a form of [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s [[classical conditioning]]—where patients change their behaviors to avoid negative stimuli. According to Pavlov, people learn through associations, so if one has a phobia, it is because one associates the feared stimulus with a negative outcome.

Flooding uses a technique based on Pavlov's classical conditioning that uses exposure. There are different forms of exposure, such as imaginal exposure, virtual reality exposure, and in vivo exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Eftekhari, A.; Stines, L.R. &amp; Zoellner, L.A. (2005). Do You Need To Talk About It? Prolonged Exposure for the Treatment of Chronic PTSD. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 7(1), 70–7 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; While systematic desensitization may use these other types of exposure, flooding uses in vivo exposure, actual exposure to the feared stimulus. A patient is confronted with a situation in which the stimulus that provoked the original trauma is present. The psychologist there usually offers very little assistance or reassurance other than to help the patient to use relaxation techniques in order to calm themselves. Relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation are common in these kinds of classical conditioning procedures. The theory is that the adrenaline and fear response has a time limit, so a person should eventually have to calm down and realize that their phobia is unwarranted.&lt;ref name="Kosslyn, Stephen M. 2007"/&gt; Flooding can be done through the use of virtual reality and is fairly effective.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Price, Page Anderson &amp; Barbara O. Rothbaum (2008). Virtual Reality as Treatment for Fear of Flying: A Review of Recent Research. ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy'', 4(4), 309–15 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miquel Tortella-Feliu, Xavier Bornas &amp; Jordi Llabrés (2008). Computer-assisted exposure treatment for flight phobia ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy'', 4(2), 158–71 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Joseph Wolpe]] (1973) carried out an experiment which demonstrated flooding. He took a girl who was scared of cars, and drove her around for hours. Initially the girl was hysterical but she eventually calmed down when she realized that her situation was safe. From then on she associated a sense of ease with cars. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Psychologist [[Aletha Solter]] used flooding successfully with a 5-month-old infant who showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress following surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (2007). A case study of traumatic stress disorder in a 5-month-old infant following surgery. ''Infant Mental Health Journal,'' 28(1), 76-96.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Flooding therapy is not for every individual, and the therapist will discuss with the patient the levels of anxiety they are prepared to endure during the session.&lt;ref name="sundel"/&gt; It may also be true that exposure is not for every therapist and therapists seem to shy away from use of the technique.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, J.A.; Echiverri, A.; Zoellner, L.A.; Post L. &amp; Feeny, N.C.

[[File:LampFlowchart.svg|thumb|right| A simple flowchart representing a process for dealing with a non-functioning lamp.]] 
A '''flowchart''' is a type of [[diagram]] that represents an [[algorithm]], [[workflow]] or process. The flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given [[Problem solving|problem]]. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields.&lt;ref name ="SSEV"&gt;[http://pascal.computer.org/sev_display/index.action SEVOCAB: Software Systems Engineering Vocabulary]. Term: ''Flow chart''. Retrieved 31 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:For-loop-diagram.png|thumb|right|Flowchart of a [[C (programming language)|C-style]] ''[[for loop|for&amp;nbsp;loop]]'']]
Flowcharts are used in designing and documenting simple processes or programs. Like other types of diagrams, they help visualize what is going on and thereby help understand a process, and perhaps also find less-obvious features within the process, like flaws and [[Bottleneck (production)|bottleneck]]s. There are different types of flowcharts: each type has its own set of boxes and notations. The two most common types of boxes in a flowchart are:

* a processing step, usually called ''activity'', and denoted as a rectangular box.
* a decision, usually denoted as a diamond.
 
A flowchart is described as "cross-functional" when the chart is divided into different vertical or horizontal parts, to describe the control of different organizational units. A symbol appearing in a particular part is within the control of that organizational unit.  A cross-functional flowchart allows the author to correctly locate the responsibility for performing an action or making a decision, and to show the responsibility of each organizational unit for different parts of a single process.

Flowcharts depict certain aspects of processes and are usually complemented by other types of diagram. For instance, [[Kaoru Ishikawa]] defined the flowchart as one of the seven basic tools of quality control, next to the [[histogram]], [[Pareto chart]], [[check sheet]], [[control chart]], [[Ishikawa diagram|cause-and-effect diagram]], and the [[scatter diagram]]. Similarly, in [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], a standard concept-modeling notation used in software development, the [[activity diagram]], which is a type of flowchart, is just one of many different diagram types.

[[Nassi-Shneiderman diagram]]s and [[DRAKON|Drakon-charts]] are an alternative notation for process flow.

Common alternative names include: flow chart, process flowchart, functional flowchart, process map, process chart, functional process chart, business process model, process model, process [[flow diagram]], [[workflow|work flow]] diagram, business flow diagram. The terms "flowchart" and "flow chart" are used interchangeably.

The underlying [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] structure of a flowchart is a flow graph, which abstracts away node types, their contents and other ancillary information.

== History ==
The first structured method for documenting process flow, the "[[flow process chart]]", was introduced by [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth|Frank]] and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian Gilbreth]] in the presentation "Process Charts: First Steps in Finding the One Best Way to do Work", to members of the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Lillian Moller Gilbreth (1921) ''[https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE/GilbrethLibrary/gilbrethproject/processcharts.pdf Process Charts]''. American Society of Mechanical Engineers.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gilbreths' tools quickly found their way into [[industrial engineering]] curricula. In the early 1930s, an industrial engineer, [[Allan H. Mogensen]] began to train business people in the use of some of the tools of industrial engineering at his Work Simplification Conferences in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

Art Spinanger, a 1944 graduate of [[Allan H. Mogensen|Mogensen]]'s class, took the tools back to [[Procter and Gamble]] where he developed their Deliberate Methods Change Program.  [[Benjamin S. Graham|Ben S. Graham]], another 1944 graduate, Director of Formcraft Engineering at [[Standard Register Industrial]], applied the flow process chart to information processing with his development of the multi-flow process chart, to present multiple documents and their relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Graham, Jr. |first = Ben S. |title = People come first |work = Keynote Address at ''Workflow Canada'' |url = http://www.worksimp.com/articles/keynoteworkflowcanada.htm |date = 10 June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, [[ASME]] adopted a symbol set derived from Gilbreth's original work as the "ASME Standard: Operation and Flow Process Charts."&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Mechanical Engineers (1947) ''ASME standard; operation and flow process charts''. New York, 1947. ([http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/005735891 online version])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas Hartree]] in 1949 explained that [[Herman Goldstine]] and [[John von Neumann]] had developed a flowchart (originally, diagram) to plan computer programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hartree | first = Douglas | authorlink = Douglas Rayner Hartree |url=https://archive.org/stream/calculatinginstr00doug#page/112/mode/2up| title =Calculating Instruments and Machines | publisher = The University of Illinois Press | year = 1949 | page = 112}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary account was endorsed by IBM engineers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bashe | first = Charles | title = IBM's Early Computers | publisher = The MIT Press | year = 1986 | page = 327}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Goldstine's personal recollections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Goldstine  | first = Herman  | authorlink = Herman H. Goldstine  | title = The Computer from Pascal to Von Neumann  | publisher = Princeton University Press   | year = 1972  | pages = 266–267  | isbn = 0-691-08104-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original programming flowcharts of Goldstine and von Neumann can be found in their unpublished report, "Planning and coding of problems for an electronic computing instrument, Part II, Volume 1" (1947), which is reproduced in von Neumann's collected works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Taub | first = Abraham | authorlink = Abraham Haskel Taub | title = John von Neumann Collected Works | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1963 | volume = 5 | pages = 80–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flowchart became a popular tool for describing [[computer algorithm]]s, but its popularity decreased in the 1970s, when interactive [[computer terminal]]s and [[third-generation programming language]]s became common tools for [[computer programming]], since algorithms can be expressed more concisely as [[source code]] in such [[programming language|languages]]. Often [[pseudo-code]] is used, which uses the common idioms of such languages without strictly adhering to the details of a particular one.

Nowadays flowcharts are still used for describing [[computer algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bohl, Rynn: "Tools for Structured and Object-Oriented Design", Prentice Hall, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern techniques such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[activity diagram]]s and [[DRAKON|Drakon-charts]] can be considered to be extensions of the flowchart.

== Types ==
Sterneckert (2003) suggested that flowcharts can be modeled from the perspective of different user groups (such as managers, system analysts and clerks), and that there are four general types:&lt;ref name="Ster03"&gt;Alan B. Sterneckert (2003) ''Critical Incident Management''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8z93xStbEpAC&amp;lpg=PP126&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 126]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Document flowcharts'', showing controls over a document-flow through a system
* ''Data flowcharts'', showing controls over a data-flow in a system
* ''System flowcharts'', showing controls at a physical or resource level
* ''Program flowchart'', showing the controls in a program within a system
Notice that every type of flowchart focuses on some kind of control, rather than on the particular flow itself.&lt;ref name="Ster03"/&gt;

However, there are some different classifications. For example, Andrew Veronis (1978) named three basic types of flowcharts: the ''system flowchart'', the ''general flowchart'', and the ''detailed flowchart''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Veronis (1978) ''Microprocessors: Design and Applications''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GZ9QAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22three+basic+types+of+flowcharts+%28ie,+the+system+flowchart,+the+general+flowchart,+and+the+detailed+flowchart%29.%22&amp;dq=%22three+basic+types+of+flowcharts+%28ie,+the+system+flowchart,+the+general+flowchart,+and+the+detailed+flowchart%29.%22&amp;as_brr=0 p. 111]&lt;/ref&gt; That same year Marilyn Bohl (1978) stated "in practice, two kinds of flowcharts are used in solution planning: ''system flowcharts'' and ''program flowcharts''...".&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Bohl (1978) ''A Guide for Programmers''. p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Mark A. Fryman (2001) identified more differences: "Decision flowcharts, logic flowcharts, systems flowcharts, product flowcharts, and process flowcharts are just a few of the different types of flowcharts that are used in business and government".&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Fryman (2001) ''Quality and Process Improvement''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=M-_B7czAy0kC&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 169].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many diagram techniques are similar to flowcharts but carry a different name, such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[activity diagram]]s.

== Software ==

=== Diagramming ===
[[File:Flowgorithm Editor.png|thumb|right|Flowgorithm]]
Any drawing program can be used to create flowchart diagrams, but these will have no underlying data model to share data with databases or other programs such as [[project management]] systems or [[spreadsheet]]. Some tools such as [[yEd]], [[Inkscape]] and [[Microsoft Visio]] offer special support for flowchart drawing. Many software packages exist that can create flowcharts automatically, either directly from a programming language source code, or from a flowchart description language.

There are several applications and [[visual programming languages]]&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Brad A. "[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/papers/chi86vltax.pdf Visual programming, programming by example, and program visualization: a taxonomy.]" ACM SIGCHI Bulletin. Vol. 17. No. 4. ACM, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; that use flowcharts to represent and execute programs. Generally these are used as teaching tools for beginner students. Examples include [[Flowgorithm]], [[Raptor (programming language)|Raptor]]. LARP, [[Visual Logic]], and VisiRule.

== Ordinary fractal strings ==

An ''ordinary fractal string'' &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; is a bounded, open subset of the real number line. Any such subset can be written as an at-most-[[countable set|countable]] union of connected [[open interval]]s with associated lengths &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}=\{\ell_1,\ell_2,\ldots\} &lt;/math&gt; written in non-increasing order. We allow &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; to consist of finitely many open intervals, in which case &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt; consists of finitely many lengths. We refer to &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt; as a ''fractal string''.

==Example==
The [[Cantor ternary set|middle third's Cantor set]] is constructed by removing the middle third from the unit interval &lt;math&gt; (0,1) &lt;/math&gt;, then removing the middle thirds of the subsequent intervals, ''ad infinitum''. The deleted intervals &lt;math&gt; \Omega=\left\{ \left(\frac 1 3, \frac 2 3 \right), \left( \frac 1 9, \frac 2 9 \right), \left( \frac 7 9, \frac 8 9 \right),\ldots\right\} &lt;/math&gt; have corresponding lengths &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}=\left\{ \frac 1 3, \frac 1 9, \frac 1 9,\ldots\right\} &lt;/math&gt;. Inductively, we can show that there are &lt;math&gt; 2^{n-1} &lt;/math&gt; intervals corresponding to each length of &lt;math&gt; 3^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, we say that the ''multiplicity'' of the length &lt;math&gt; 3^{-n} &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; 2^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Heuristic==

The geometric information of the Cantor set in the example above is contained in the ordinary fractal string &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt;. From this information we can compute the [[box-counting dimension]] of the Cantor set. This notion of [[fractal dimension]] can be generalized to that of [[complex dimension]], which will give us complete geometrical information regarding the local oscillations in the geometry of the Cantor set.

==The geometric zeta function==
If &lt;math&gt; \sum_{j \in \mathbb{J}} {\ell_j}&lt; \infty, &lt;/math&gt; we say that &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; has a geometric realization in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \Omega=\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty I_i &lt;/math&gt;, where the &lt;math&gt;I_i &lt;/math&gt; are intervals in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;, of all the lengths &lt;math&gt; \{ \ell_j \}_{j \in \mathbb{J}} &lt;/math&gt;, taken with multiplicity.

For each fractal string &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt;, we can associate to &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt; a geometric zeta function &lt;math&gt; \zeta_{\mathcal{L}} &lt;/math&gt; defined as the Dirichlet series &lt;math&gt; \zeta_{\mathcal{L}} (s)=\sum_{j \in \mathbb{J}} \ell_j^{s} &lt;/math&gt;.  Poles of the geometric zeta function &lt;math&gt; \zeta_{\mathcal{L}} (s) &lt;/math&gt; are called complex dimensions of the fractal string &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt;. The general philosophy of the theory of complex dimensions for fractal strings is that complex dimensions describe the intrinsic oscillation in the geometry, spectra and dynamics of the fractal string &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt;. 

The [[abscissa of convergence]] of &lt;math&gt; \zeta_{\mathcal{L}}(s) &lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt; \sigma=\inf \left\{ \alpha \in \mathbb{R} : \sum_{j=1}^\infty \ell_j^\alpha &lt; \infty \right\} &lt;/math&gt;.

For a fractal string &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt; with infinitely many nonzero lengths, the abscissa of convergence &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; coincides with the [[Minkowski dimension]] of the boundary of the string, &lt;math&gt; \partial \Omega &lt;/math&gt;. For our example, the boundary Cantor string is the Cantor set itself. So the abscissa of convergence of the geometric zeta function &lt;math&gt; \zeta_{\mathcal{L}}(s)  &lt;/math&gt; is the Minkowski dimension of the Cantor set, which is &lt;math&gt; \frac{\log 2}{\log 3} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Complex dimensions==

For a fractal string &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt;, composed of an infinite sequence of lengths, the ''complex dimensions'' of the fractal string are the poles of the analytic continuation of the geometric zeta function associated with the fractal string. (When the analytic continuation of a geometric zeta function is not defined to all of the complex plane, we take a subset of the complex plane called the "window", and look for the "visible" complex dimensions that exist within that window.&lt;ref name=one/&gt;)

==Example==

Continuing with the example of the fractal string associated to the middle thirds Cantor set, we compute &lt;math&gt; \zeta_{\mathbb{C}}(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{2^{n-1}}{3^{ns}} =\frac{\frac{1}{3^s}}{1-\frac{2}{3^s}} &lt;/math&gt;. We compute the [[abscissa of convergence]] to be the value of &lt;math&gt; s &lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt; 3^s=2 &lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt; s=\log_3 2=\frac{\log 2}{\log 3} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Minkowski dimension]] of the Cantor set.

For complex &lt;math&gt; s &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \zeta_{\mathbb{C}}(s) &lt;/math&gt; has [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] at the infinitely many solutions of &lt;math&gt; 3^s=2 &lt;/math&gt;, which, for this example, occur at &lt;math&gt; s=\frac{\log 2 + 2 \pi i k}{\log 3} &lt;/math&gt;, for all integers &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;. This collection of points is called the set of complex dimensions of the middle thirds Cantor set.

==Applications==

For fractal strings associated with sets like Cantor sets, formed from deleted intervals that are [[rational number|rational]] powers of a fundamental length, the complex dimensions appear in a regular, arithmetic progression parallel to the imaginary axis, and are called ''lattice'' fractal strings. Sets that do not have this property are called ''non-lattice''. There is a dichotomy in the theory of measures of such objects: an ordinary fractal string is Minkowski measurable if and only if it is non-lattice.

In,&lt;ref name=one&gt;M. L. Lapidus, M. van Frankenhuijsen, [https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9781461421757 Fractal Geometry, Complex Dimensions and Zeta Functions: Geometry and Spectra of Fractal Strings], Monographs in Mathematics, Springer, New York, Second
revised and enlarged edition, 2012. {{doi|10.1007/978-1-4614-2176-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of non-real complex dimensions with positive real part are proposed to be the signature feature of fractal objects. Formally in,&lt;ref name=one/&gt; Michel Lapidus and Machiel van Frankenhuijsen propose to define “fractality” as the presence of at least one nonreal complex dimension with positive real part. This new definition of fractality solves some old problems in Fractal Geometry. For example, everyone can agree that the Cantor's Devil Staircase is fractal, which it is with this new definition of fractality in terms of complex dimensions, but it is not in the sense of Mandelbrot. 

A Spectral Reformulation of the Riemann Hypothesis by Michel Lapidus and Helmut Maier

Following the examples of the a-string and of the ordinary Cantor string given by Michel Lapidus in the 1990s,
the notion of a fractal string was conceived and defined by Michel Lapidus and Carl Pomerance in their investigation of the one-dimensional Weyl-Berry conjecture for fractal drums and its connection  with the Riemann zeta function ~\cite{LapPo}.
The Riemann hypothesis turned out to be equivalent to the solvability of the corresponding inverse spectral problem for fractal strings, as was established by Michel Lapidus and Helmut Maier in ~\cite{LapMa}.
The heuristic notion of complex dimensions then started to emerge and was used in a crucial way in their spectral reformulation of the Riemann hypothesis.
The precise notion of complex dimensions, defined as the poles of the geometric zeta function associated with the fractal string, was crystallized and rigorously developed by Michel Lapidus and Machiel van Frankenhuijsen in the research monograph Fractal Geometry and Number Theory \cite{L-vF1} and then significantly further extended in the book
Fractal Geometry, Complex Dimensions and Zeta Functions ~\cite{L-vF2}.

The work of Michel Lapidus and Helmut Maier can be summarized as follows:

The inverse spectral problem for a fractal string can be solved if and only if its dimension is not 1/2.

The inverse spectral problem for a fractal string is not solvable in dimension 1/2 because the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)=1+1/2^s+1/3^s+\cdots$ 
vanishes (infinitely often) on the critical line $\Re(s)=1/2$. Therefore, the inverse spectral problem  is solvable in dimension $D\neq 1/2$ if and only if the Riemann zeta function does not vanish off the critical line $\Re(s)=1/2$ or, equivalently, if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is true.

'''''Freedom Evolves''''' is a 2003 popular science and philosophy book by [[Daniel C. Dennett]].  Dennett describes the book as an installment of a lifelong philosophical project, earlier parts of which were ''[[The Intentional Stance]]'', ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'' and ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]''. It attempts to give an account of [[free will]] and [[morality|moral]] responsibility which is complementary to Dennett's other views on [[consciousness]] and personhood.

== Synopsis ==
As in ''Consciousness Explained'', Dennett advertises the controversial nature of his views extensively in advance. He expects hostility from those who fear that a skeptical analysis of freedom will undermine people's belief in the reality of moral considerations; he likens himself to an interfering crow who insists on telling [[Dumbo]] he doesn't really need the feather he believes is allowing him to fly.

=== Free will  and altruism===

Dennett's stance on [[free will]] is [[compatibilism]] with an evolutionary twist &amp;ndash; the view that, although in the strict physical sense our actions might be pre-determined, we can still be free in all the ways that matter, because of the abilities we evolved.  Free will, seen this way, is about [[agency (philosophy)|freedom to make decisions]] without duress (and so is a version of Kantian positive practical free will, i.e., Kantian autonomy), as opposed to an impossible and unnecessary freedom from causality itself.  To clarify this distinction, he uses the term 'evitability' (the opposite of 'inevitability'), defining it as the ability of an agent to anticipate likely consequences and act to avoid undesirable ones. ''Evitability'' is entirely compatible with, and actually requires, human action being deterministic.
Dennett moves on to [[altruism]], denying that it requires acting to the benefit of others without gaining any benefit yourself.  He argues that it should be understood in terms of helping yourself by helping others, expanding the self to be more inclusive as opposed to being selfless.  To show this blend, he calls such actions 'benselfish', and finds the roots of our capacity for this in the [[evolution]]ary pressures that produced [[kin selection]].  
In his treatment of both free will and altruism, he starts by showing why we should not accept the traditional definitions of either term.

===Beneficial mutual arrangements===

Dennett also suggests that adherence to high [[ethical]] standards might pay off for the individual, because if others know your behaviour is restricted in these ways, the scope for certain beneficial mutual arrangements is enhanced.  This is related to [[Game theory|game theoretical]] considerations: in the famous [[Prisoner's Dilemma]], 'moral' agents who cooperate will be more successful than 'non-moral' agents who do not cooperate.  Cooperation wouldn't seem to naturally arise since agents are tempted to 'defect' and restore a [[Nash equilibrium]], which is often not the best possible solution for all involved.  Dennett concludes by contemplating the possibility that people might be able to opt in or out of moral responsibility: surely, he suggests, given the benefits, they would choose to opt in, especially given that opting out includes such things as being imprisoned or institutionalized.

===Libet's experiments===
Daniel Dennett also argues that no clear conclusion about volition can be derived from [[Benjamin Libet]]'s experiments supposedly demonstrating the non-existence of conscious volition. According to Dennett, ambiguities in the timings of the different events are involved. Libet tells when the readiness potential occurs objectively, using electrodes, but relies on the subject reporting the position of the hand of a clock to determine when the conscious decision was made. As Dennett points out, this is only a report of where it ''seems'' to the subject that various things come together, not of the objective time at which they actually occur.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suppose Libet knows that your readiness potential peaked at millisecond 6,810 of the experimental trial, and the clock dot was straight down (which is what you reported you saw) at millisecond 7,005. How many milliseconds should he have to add to this number to get the time you were conscious of it? The light gets from your clock face to your eyeball almost instantaneously, but the path of the signals from  retina through lateral geniculate nucleus to striate cortex takes 5 to 10 milliseconds&amp;mdash;a paltry fraction of the 300 milliseconds offset, but how much longer does it take them to get to ''you''. (Or are you located in the striate cortex?) The visual signals have to be processed before they arrive at wherever they need to arrive for you to make a conscious decision of simultaneity. Libet's method presupposes, in short, that we can locate the ''intersection'' of two trajectories:
* the rising-to-consciousness of signals representing the decision to flick
* the rising to consciousness of signals representing successive clock-face orientations
so that these events occur side-by-side as it were in  place where their simultaneity can be noted.&lt;ref&gt;"Freedom Evolves" by Daniel Dennett, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/SelfasaResponding.pdf Dennett, D. ''The Self as Responding and Responsible Artefact'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Robert Kane===
Dennett spends a chapter criticising [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]]'s theory of [[libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian free will]]. Kane believes freedom is based on certain rare and exceptional events, which he calls self-forming actions or SFA's. Dennett notes that there is no guarantee such an event will occur in an individual's life. If it does not, the individual does not in fact have free will at all, according to Kane. Yet they will seem the same as anyone else. Dennett finds an essentially ''indetectable'' notion of free will to be incredible.

Ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism consider ''Grihastha'' stage as the most important of all stages in sociological context, as human beings in this stage not only pursue a virtuous life, they produce food and wealth that sustains people in other stages of life, as well as the offsprings that continues mankind.&lt;ref name=rks/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alban Widgery (1930), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2377977 The Principles of Hindu Ethics], International Journal of Ethics, 40(2): 232-245&lt;/ref&gt; The householder stage is also considered in Indian philosophy as one where the most intense physical, sexual, emotional, occupational, social and material attachments exist in a human being's life.&lt;ref&gt;Mazumdar and Mazumdar (2005), Home in the Context of Religion, in Home and Identity in Late Life: International Perspectives (Editor: Graham D. Rowles et al.), Springer, {{ISBN|978-0826127150}}, pages 81-103&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indian traditions, ''Grihastha'' stage of life is a recommendation, but not a requirement. Any ''Brahmacharya'' may, if he or she wants, skip householder and retirement stage, go straight to Sannyasa stage of life, thereby renouncing worldly and materialistic pursuits and dedicating their lives to spiritual pursuits.&lt;ref name=wih&gt;What is Hinduism?

==Etymology==
{{Hinduism}}
The Sanskrit word ''Grihastha'' (गृहस्थ) is a composite "Grih-astha" of two root words ''Grih'' (गृह) and ''Astha'' (अस्थ). ''Grih'' means "home, family, house",&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=stha+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU gRha] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Asth'' means "devoted to, occupied with, being in".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=stha+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU stha] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University&lt;/ref&gt; Grihastha means that which "being in and occupied with home, family" or simply "householder".&lt;ref name=grhastha&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=gRhastha&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 gRhastha] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
Grihastha is part of the ancient [[Hindu]] concept called [[Chaturashrama]], which identified four stages of a human life, with distinct differences based on natural human needs and drives, as well as how these ''stages'' integrated with fulfilling, joyful four ''goals'' of life called [[Purushartha]] - [[Dharma]] (piety, morality, duties), [[Artha]] (wealth, health, means of life), [[Kama]] (love, relationships, emotions) and [[Moksha]] (liberation, freedom, self-realization).&lt;ref name=wih/&gt; Grihastha is considered to be the most intense of all four stages, where a man or woman pursues all four goals of life, with greater emphasis on first three - Dharma, Artha and Kama.&lt;ref name=sgn/&gt;&lt;ref name=mb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R Sharma (1986), A Socio-political Study of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800786}}, page 435&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Sannyasa]] is the stage where the individual renounces Artha and Kama, and pursues Moksha with a single minded pursuit.&lt;ref name=sgn/&gt;&lt;ref name=wih/&gt;

The stage "Grihastha" is preceded by [[Brahmacharya]] (student) stage of life, and followed by [[Vanaprastha]] (retirement, forest dweller, still an advisor to the next generation) stage. In ancient texts, Grihastha stage of life is said to extend from the age of about 25 to about 50.&lt;ref name=wih/&gt;

A man or woman entered the ''Grihastha'' stage after a [[Hindu wedding]]. They would build a home, raise a family, earn wealth, enjoy worldly life and participate in the society through virtues such as [[Dāna|charity]].&lt;ref name=sgn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Gray (2009), Where truth happens: The Nepali house as Mandala, Anthropologica, 51(1): 195-208&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
The [[Chandogya Upanishad]] and [[Brahma Sutras|Vedānta Sūtras]] discuss all four stages of life - student, householder, retired/hermit and ascetic. However they hold ''Grihastha'' ashram as the highest because, explains verse III.4.48, not only does the householder performs the duties recommended for all four asramas, they have to produce food and goods on which people in other ashramas survive. The shared duties of four ashramas are - tenderness for all living creatures ([[ahimsa]]), [[Yamas|self-restraints]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, The [[Sacred Books of the East]]: The Vedanta-Sutras, Pt. 2, Vol. XXXVIII, Oxford University Press, pages 324-325&lt;/ref&gt;

Some chapters of the Upanishads, for example hymn 4.4.22 of [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], specify only three stages of human life – Brahmacharya, Grihastha and Vanaprastha.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]] (1906), The Philosophy of the Upanishads, T&amp;T Clark, Edinburgh, pages 54-61&lt;/ref&gt; They make no mention of gender, class or caste restrictions on these stages of life. All three stages are recommended as path to [[Brahman]] (inner Self, Soul). In contrast, later texts&lt;ref&gt;See the following Upanishads: Brahma, Sannyasa, Aruneya, Kantha, Paramahamsa, Jabala and Ashrama; For English translations and secondary source - see Paul Deussen (1906), The Philosophy of the Upanishads, T&amp;T Clark, Edinburgh, pages 374-377&lt;/ref&gt; specify four stages of human life.

;Dharmasutras and Dharmasmritis
Grihastha ashram, declares [[Gautama's Dharmasutra|Gautama Dharmasutra]] in verses 3.2 and 3.3, is the foundation of all the ashrams, and essential to the existence and continuation of society because the other three ashrams do not produce offspring.&lt;ref name=rks/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit Original: [http://www.hinduonline.co/vedicreserve/kalpa/dharma/gautama_dharma_sutra.pdf Gautama Dharma Sutra] page 3;&lt;br&gt;

[[Manusmṛti|Manusmriti]], similarly states in Sections VI.87 through VI.90, that it is the householders who feed all those in other three stages of life, and those who seek spiritual pursuits live on, attain fulfillment because of those who accept and prosper in Grihastha ashram.&lt;ref&gt;Original: [https://archive.org/stream/ManuSmritHindi-GpDwivedi#page/n343/mode/2up ManuSmriti] Chapter 6, Verses 87-90 (in Sanskrit);&lt;br&gt;English Translation: Max Muller, {{Google books|VAobAAAAYAAJ|The Laws of Manu|page=214}}, The Sacred Books of the East, Oxford University Press, pages 214-215&lt;br&gt;English Translation 2: RK Sharma (1999), Indian Society, Institutions and Change, {{ISBN|978-8171566655}}, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; Manusmriti uses the concept of ashram broadly, and in verses III.77 to III.80, declares Grihastha stage as noble, excellent and that "just like all beings need air to survive, so do all beings take life from the ''Grihastha Ashram'' because of the food they produce and knowledge they apply".&lt;ref name=rks/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Muller]], {{Google books|VAobAAAAYAAJ|The Laws of Manu|page=89}}, The Sacred Books of the East, Oxford University Press, page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sections IV.1 through IV.6, Manusmriti states a Brahmana, after being twice-born and completing his studies with his teacher, should marry and live in his house.&lt;ref name=mm2/&gt; He must seek a means of living that causes no injury or least possible injury to all living beings, except in times of distress. For this householder stage, the text declares that the Brahmana (graduate from Brahmacharya) should accumulate property by ethically pursuing his caste's occupation.&lt;ref name=mm2/&gt; Manusmriti lists&lt;ref name=mm2&gt;Original: [https://archive.org/stream/ManuSmritHindi-GpDwivedi#page/n253/mode/2up ManuSmriti] Chapter 4, Verses 1-6, pages 114-115 (in Sanskrit);&lt;br&gt;English Translation 1: Max Muller, {{Google books|VAobAAAAYAAJ|The Laws of Manu|page=128}}, The Sacred Books of the East, Oxford University Press, pages 128-129;&lt;br&gt;English Translation 2: William Jones (1796), [https://archive.org/stream/institutesofhind00manu#page/88/mode/2up Manu Smriti - Ordinances of Manu] Chapter the Fourth, page 89&lt;/ref&gt; five appropriate sources of income or means for survival for the educated Brahmana - [[Ṛta]] (ऋत, lawful gleaning and gathering, proper natural work&lt;ref&gt;Muller translates it as gleaning of corn, William Jones as lawful gleaning and gathering, Prasad translates it as proper natural work&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Amrita|Amrta]] (अमृत, accepting gifts and charity), Mrta (मृत, begging), Pramrta (प्रमृत,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=pramrita+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU pramRta] Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; agriculture, tillage) and Satyanrta (सत्यानृत,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=Satyanrita+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU satyAnRta] Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; trade, commerce, money lending). The text disapproves of one means of survival for the householder - Shvavritti (श्ववृत्ति,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=zvavRtti&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 zvavRtti] Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; dog-like subsistence, servitude, slavery&lt;ref&gt;Muller translates it as dog-like menial subsistence, William Jones translates this as service for hire, Prasad translates it as slavery&lt;/ref&gt;).

When the scriptural studies appropriate to the student have been completed, and he has received blessings of his Guru, let him enter into the order of the '''Grihastha''' (householder). Let him pursue and obtain, by ethical ways, home, wife, and wealth, discharge to the best of his ability the duties of his life's stage. He should satisfy the soul of his ancestors with funeral cakes; the gods with oblations; guests with hospitality; the sages with holy study; the progenitors of mankind with progeny; the spirits with reverence; and all the world with words of truth.|Vishnu Purana|3.IX.1 - 3.IX.31 &lt;ref name=hhw/&gt;}}

It hath been said in the oldest Upanishad that a '''Grihastha''' (householder), acquiring wealth by honest means, should perform sacrifices; he should always give something in charity, should perform the rites of hospitality unto all arriving at his abode, and should never use anything without giving a portion thereof to others. He should abstain from all vicious acts, should never inflict pain on any creature.

The '''Indian Child Welfare Act''' of 1978 ('''ICWA''') (({{USStatute|95|608|92|3069|1978|11|08}}), codified at {{usc|25|1901|1963}}&lt;ref name=ICWA&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, ({{USStatute|95|608|92|3069|1978|11|08}}, {{usc|25|1901|1963}})&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Federal law that governs jurisdiction over the removal of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] (Indian) children from their families.

==Overview of ICWA==

===General===
ICWA gives tribal governments a strong voice concerning [[child custody]] proceedings that involve Indian children, by allocating tribes [[exclusive jurisdiction]] over the case when the child resides on, or is domiciled on, the reservation, or when the child is a [[Ward (law)|ward]] of the tribe; and [[concurrent jurisdiction|concurrent]], but presumptive, jurisdiction over non-reservation Native Americans' foster care placement proceedings.&lt;ref name=ICWA1911&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, {{usc|25|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
ICWA was enacted in 1978 because of the disproportionately high rate of forced removal of Indian children from their traditional homes and essentially from American Indian cultures as a whole. Before enactment, as many as 25 to 35 percent of all Indian children were being forcibly removed, mostly from intact American Indian families, and placed in non-Indian homes, with a deliberate absence of American Indian cultures.&lt;ref name=JohnsonWSR&gt;Johnson, Troy R. (1999), "The State and the American Indian: Who Gets the Indian Child?," 14 ''Wicazo Sa R.'' 197 (University of Minnesota Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JonesABA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abanet.org/genpractice/magazine/1995/fall/indianchildwelfareact.html |title=The Indian Child Welfare Act: The need for a separate law |author=Jones, B.J. |year=1995 |work=General Practice, Solo &amp; Small Firm Division |publisher=American Bar Association |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) paid the states to remove Indian children and to place them with non-Indian families and religious groups.&lt;ref name=Lowe352&gt;Lowe, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;  Testimony in the [[United States House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs|House Committee for Interior and Insular Affairs]] showed that in some cases, the per capita rate of Indian children in foster care was nearly 16 times higher than the rate for non-Indians.&lt;ref name=HouseRpt&gt;H. Rep. No. 95-608, 95th Cong., 2d. Sess. (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 7530, 1978 CIS H443-53&lt;/ref&gt;  If Indian children had continued to be removed from Indian homes at this rate, tribal survival would be threatened. It also damaged the emotional lives of many children, as adults having been through the process testified. Congress recognized this, and stated that the interests of tribal stability were as important as the best interests of the child.&lt;ref name=Josephy124&gt;Josephy, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; One of the factors in this judgment was that, because of the differences in culture, what was in the best interest of a non-Indian child was not necessarily what was in the best interest of an Indian child, especially as they have traditionally larger extended families and tribal relationships in their culture.&lt;ref name=JonesTilden12&gt;Jones, ''The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook,'' p.12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Louis La Rose ([[Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska]]) testified:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think the cruelest trick that the white man has ever done to Indian children is to take them into adoption court, erase all of their records and send them off to some nebulous family ... residing in a white community and he goes back to the reservation and he has absolutely no idea who his relatives are, and they effectively make him a non-person and I think ... they destroy him.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson258&gt;Wilkinson, p. 258-260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Congress recognized that four primary factors contributed to the high rates of Indian child removal. These were 1) "a lack of culturally competent State child-welfare standards for assessing the fitness of Indian families; 2) systematic due-process violations against both Indian children and their parents during child-custody procedures; 3) economic incentives favoring removal of Indian children from their families and communities; 4) and social conditions in Indian country." &lt;ref&gt;81 Fed. Reg. 38780 (June 14, 2016)_&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other groups have also had stakes in these decisions. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) had an [[Indian Placement Program]] that removed Indian children from their tribes and into church members homes.  By the 1970s, approximately 5,000 Indian children were living in Mormon homes.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson258 /&gt;  The lack of knowledge about American Indian culture by most social workers also contributed to the high removal rates.  Most social workers are conditioned by the "[[Best interests|best interest of the child]]" as outlined by ''Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (Second Edition),'' which advocates bonding with at least one adult as a parent figure.&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;Goldstein, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; This did not take into consideration the tribal culture of the extended tribal family, in which children could have close relationships with extended family.  Common American Indian practices of having a child cared for by an extended relative was viewed as abandonment by allegedly well-intentioned but arguably paternalistic social workers. But tribal members considered this normal behavior and a desirable way to ensure the child was cared for by family.&lt;ref name=JonesTilden3&gt;Jones, ''The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook,'' p.3-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

During congressional consideration, held at the request of Native American advocacy groups, opposition was raised by several states, the LDS Church, and several social welfare groups.  The bill was pushed through by Representative [[Morris Udall]] of [[Arizona]], who lobbied President [[Jimmy Carter]] to sign the bill.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson258 /&gt; It was strongly supported by Senator [[James Abourezk]] of South Dakota, who had authored the bill and previously contributed to founding the American Indian Policy Review Commission and the [[Select Committee on Indian Affairs]], each of which he chaired.&lt;ref name="abourezk"&gt;[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/08/war-words-icwa-faces-multiple-assaults-adoption-industry-160993 Suzette Brewer, "War of Words: ICWA Faces Multiple Assaults From Adoption Industry"], ''Indian Country Today'', 8 July 2015; accessed 9 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress's overriding purpose in passing the ICWA was to protect Indian culture and tribal integrity from the unnecessary removal of Indian children by state and federal agencies.  Awareness of the issues facing American Indian children came about from the advocacy and research by the [[Association on American Indian Affairs]].  Congress reasoned that "there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children."&lt;ref name=ICWA1902&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, {{usc|25|1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal challenge====
In October 2018, Federal District Court Judge [[Reed Charles O'Connor|Reed O'Connor]] struck down parts of the law as unconstitutional due to it mandating racial preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/federal_court_declares_indian_child_welfare_act_unconstitutional|title=Federal court in Texas declares Indian Child Welfare Act unconstitutional|first=Lorelei|last=Laird|date=October 10, 2018|work=[[ABA Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jurisdiction===

====Minimum Standards====
ICWA sets the minimal Federal standards for nearly all Indian child custody proceedings, including adoption, voluntary and involuntary termination of parental rights, and removal and foster care placement of Indian children, but excluding divorce and child delinquency proceedings.  ICWA provides that state courts have no jurisdiction over the adoption or custody of Indian children residing within their own tribal reservation.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; An "Indian child" is "any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe."&lt;ref name=ICWA1903&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, {{usc|25|1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICWA applies to a "child custody proceeding"&lt;ref name=ICWA1903 /&gt; involving an Indian child.  The term "child custody proceeding" involves: (i) "foster care placements", where the child has been placed in a foster home, and the parent cannot have the child returned upon demand, but where parental rights have not been terminated; (2) terminations of parental rights; (3) "preadoptive placements", which means placing the child in a foster home after the termination of parental rights, but before or instead of an adoption; and (4) adoptions.&lt;ref name=ICWA1903 /&gt;

ICWA does not cover child custody hearings during divorce proceedings. Nor does ICWA cover cases of child delinquency where the child has done something that would be considered a crime if done by an adult.  Because Indian tribes play a major part in the upbringing of Indian children that is significantly different than that of the parents, the ICWA gives important jurisdictional powers to Indian tribes in order to preserve the Indian culture.  Tribal courts hold either [[exclusive jurisdiction]] or [[concurrent jurisdiction]] dependent on several factors.&lt;ref name=ICWA1911 /&gt;

====Exclusive tribal jurisdiction====
Under ICWA, an Indian tribe has exclusive jurisdiction over an Indian child who resides or is domiciled within the tribe's land.  This includes both reservation land, other tribal lands that are held in trust by the Federal government for the benefit of a tribe or individual, or held by a tribe or individual subject to a restriction by the United States against alienation.  The last two describe tribal lands such as those in [[Oklahoma]] that were transferred to individual Indians under various laws.  The Indian tribal courts also have exclusive jurisdiction over Indian children who are wards of the court or tribe, regardless of their location.&lt;ref name=ICWA1903 /&gt;

The first [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case dealing with ICWA was the 1989 case  ''[[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield]]'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=490&amp;page=30 (490 U.S. 30, 109 S.Ct. 1597)].   This Court ruled that the ICWA gives the tribal court [[exclusive jurisdiction]] over a case where the parent was domiciled on the reservation, no matter what their own personal desires are in the custody case.

====Concurrent jurisdiction====
Concurrent jurisdiction is shared jurisdiction between the tribal courts and the state courts. State courts have been severely criticized for ignoring the requirements of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. McCarthy, The Indian Child Welfare Act: In the Best Interests of the Child and Tribe, 27/8 CLEARINGHOUSE REVIEW 864 (December 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases that the tribal court does not have exclusive jurisdiction, they have concurrent jurisdiction.  These cases would be custody proceedings involving Indian children that don't reside or are not domiciled on the tribal lands (such as someone born off the reservation and whose parents don't live on the reservation). In these concurrent decisions, the ICWA expresses a preference for tribal jurisdiction in Indian child custody proceedings.&lt;ref name=ICWA1903 /&gt;

==Procedures==
[[File:Native American boy in Men's Northern Traditional outfit.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Maintaining tribal relationships]]

===Notification and rights===
In an involuntary proceeding, the party seeking the placement of the child,&lt;ref name= 25CFR2311&gt;25 CFR §23.11(a) (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; which is often but not always the state, must notify both the parent(s) and/or Indian custodian(s) and the child's tribe at least 10 days prior to the proceeding. Emergency proceedings may follow state law, but proceedings after that are controlled by ICWA.  If the state cannot determine who the parent or the tribe is, then the state is required to notify the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]. Notification must contain all the requisite information identified in 25 CFR § 23.111 and be sent by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested,&lt;ref name= 25CFR2311 /&gt; and the parties notified have the right to an additional 20 days to prepare prior to the proceeding.&lt;ref name=ICWA1912&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, {{usc|25|1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Failure to provide such notice can cause a jurisdictional defect that may result in any such proceeding to be overturned.&lt;ref name=JonesTilden84&gt;{{cite book| title= The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook: A Legal Guide to the Custody and Adoption of Native American Children| first1= Billy Joe |last1= Jones| first2= Mark |last2= Tilden| first3= Kelly |last3= Gaines-Stoner| publisher= American Bar Association| year= 2008| edition= 2nd |pages= 84–88| isbn= 9781590318584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF365&gt;{{cite book| title= A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act| publisher= Native American Rights Fund| year= 2007| pages= 36–41| isbn= 9780979409912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Fort&gt;{{cite journal| last= Fort| first= Kathryn E.| year= 2008| title= Beyond Minimum Standards: Federal Requirements and State Interpretations of the Indian Child Welfare Act| volume= 45 |work= Court Review | number= 26 | publisher= American Judges Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICWA case may be dismissed for lack of due process if not for the lack of jurisdiction "because ' "failure to give proper notice of a dependency proceeding to a tribe with which the dependent child may be affiliated forecloses the participation by the tribe, [ICWA] notice requirements are strictly construed." ' ." &lt;ref&gt;In re Robert A., 147 Cal.App.4th 982, 989&lt;/ref&gt;

"The determination of a child's Indian status is up to the tribe; therefore, the juvenile court needs only a suggestion of Indian ancestry to trigger the notice requirement." &lt;ref&gt;In re Nikki R. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 844, 848&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The circumstances under which a juvenile court has reason to believe that a child is an Indian child is an in Indian child include, but are not limited to, the following: '(I) Any party to the case, Indian tribe, Indian organization or public or private agency informs the court that the child is an Indian child. (II) Any public or state-licensed agency involved in child protection services or family support has discovered information which suggests that the child is an Indian child. (III) The child who is the subject of the proceeding gives the court reason to believe he or she is an Indian child. (IV) The residence or domicile of the child, his or her biological parents, or the Indian custodian is known by the court to be or is shown to be a predominantly Indian community. (V) An officer of the court involved in the proceeding has knowledge that the child may be an Indian child.'|Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings (44 Federal Register 67584, 67586 (Nov. 26, 1979) (Guidelines); [former] rule 1439(d)(2).) &lt;ref&gt;In re O.K., 106 Cal.App.4th 152, 156&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians, a tribe that is federally recognized by the U.S. Federal Government but is not recognized for services of the Bureau of Indian Affairs under 25 C.F.R 83 et al. are used for precedent for many cases whereby the following conditions apply:

In cases whereby the mother may not be a member of the tribe, however she is eligible, then before the provisions of ICWA apply, "the trial court must initially determine if a child is an Indian child within the meaning of ICWA." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;In the Interest of C.H. et al., 510 N.W.2d 119, 123 (S.D. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; This is because "a parent's current enrollment is not always dispositive of a child's membership in an Indian tribe".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The finding in the case of the children involved was "In the matter of C.H. et al., 510 N.W.2d (S.D. 1993) that the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians were held to be a Federally Recognized tribe for the purposes of ICWA.

The child may be provided an attorney, and the parents are entitled to one if they are indigent and cannot afford one.  If the state does not have provisions for providing indigent parents an attorney, the Secretary of the Interior is to pay the attorney expenses.

All of the parties have the right to examine all documents and reports related to the proceeding.&lt;ref name=ICWA1912 /&gt;

In a removal case, the party seeking the removal (normally Child Protective Services or similar agency) is required to make active efforts to provide the parent or custodian with remedial and rehabilitative services designed to prevent the removal of the child from the Indian family.  The "active effort" requirement also applies even if the party seeking removal is a private party, as in a private party adoption.&lt;ref name=ICWA1912 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In the Matter of N.B. |vol= 199 |reporter= P.3d |opinion=16 |pinpoint=31 |court=Colo. App. |date=2007 |url= |quote=Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's holding that stepmother's failure to show active efforts as required by 25 U.S.C. § 1912(d) precludes termination of mother's parental rights through this stepparent adoption.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The child may not be temporarily removed unless there is a likelihood of "serious emotional or physical damage" to the child if they remain in the home.&lt;ref name=ICWA1916&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, {{usc|25|1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intervention===
The tribe and parents or Indian custodian of the Indian child have an unqualified right to intervene in a case involving foster care placement or the termination of parental rights .  The intervention may be at any time, and not just at the beginning of the proceedings.&lt;ref name=ICWA1912 /&gt;&lt;ref name=JonesTilden88&gt;Jones, The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook, p.88-89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF46&gt;A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act, p. 46-49&lt;/ref&gt;  This right does not apply to pre-adoption or adoption proceedings unless it also includes the termination of parental rights.&lt;ref name=NARF46 /&gt;

===Transfer to Tribal Court===

====Motion to Transfer====
In a foster care or termination of parental rights case where the tribe and the state exercise concurrent jurisdiction, the tribe, either biological parent, or the Indian custodian may move to transfer the case from the state court to the tribal court.
&lt;ref name=ICWA1911 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF56&gt;A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act, p. 56-63&lt;/ref&gt;  The ICWA technically allows transfer to the tribal court at any time in the proceeding, but state courts vary on how they view transfer requests after state court proceedings are well into the adjudication process.  In some cases the state will look to the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] to deny such a transfer based on that law's time standards.&lt;ref name=NARF56 /&gt;&lt;ref name=JonesTilden65&gt;Jones, The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook, p.65-67.&lt;/ref&gt;  After a motion for transfer has been made, there is a presumption that the tribal court will receive the case and the state court is required to make the transfer unless one of three factors is present.&lt;ref name=ICWA1911 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF56 /&gt;

====Objection to Transfer====
A biological parent, whether Indian or non-Indian may object to and veto a proposed transfer of a case to tribal court.  A prospective parent, the Indian child, or another party may object, but may not veto a transfer, and those objections would be covered under the "good cause" provision.  In the event that a parent vetoes the transfer, the case will remain in state court.  This is most commonly seen where one of the parents is non-Indian.&lt;ref name=ICWA1911 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF56 /&gt;&lt;ref name=JonesTilden65 /&gt;

====Declination by Tribal Court====
The tribal court may decline to accept the transfer of a case from a state court.&lt;ref name=ICWA1911 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF56 /&gt;  An example is where the parents move to transfer the case, but the tribe declines to accept jurisdiction due to a lack of funding for programs that would support the child and the parents at the tribal level that are present at the state level.&lt;ref&gt;Cavanagh, Michael F. (2010), "American Indian Law: State Court Administrative Office – Court Improvement Program: Indian Child Welfare Act Forum: October 6, 2008," 89 Mich.

App. LEXIS |opinion=240 |pinpoint= |court=Neb. App. |date=2008 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that a tribal court may not be a traditional tribunal, but may be any other administrative body empowered by the tribe to act on child custody matters.&lt;ref name=NARF67&gt;A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act, p. 67-72&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Active Remediation Efforts ====
One aspect of the ICWA that may provide the most hope for Native American families is the requirement of active efforts with the existing family to rehabilitate the root cause prior to removal of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://csuglobal.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.csuglobal.idm.oclc.org/docview/1812610354?accountid=38569|title=Implementing and defending the indian child welfare act through revised state requirements.

By working with ICWA and the tribes to create preventative services that are culturally sensitive, outcomes can be dramatically changed. Those services need not be limited to tribal members, but also available to foster and adoptive families to help connect with the child's cultural roots.

====Good Cause====
A state court may decline to transfer a case for "good cause," but that term is not defined in the ICWA.  The BIA has issued an advisory set of guidelines for state courts to use in determining "good cause."&lt;ref name=NARF56 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BIAGuide&gt;Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, {{USFR|44|67584}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While these guidelines are not mandatory, many states have adopted them, and they include:
*No tribal court as defined by the ICWA,
*The proceeding was at an advanced stage when the transfer request was made, and the party asking for the transfer did not request the transfer promptly after receiving notice of the proceeding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Shageluk IRA Council v. Alaska |vol=2009 |reporter=Alas. LEXIS |opinion=25 |pinpoint= |court=Alas. |date=2009 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Indian child is over the age of 12 and objects to the transfer,
*It would cause undue hardship on the parties and/or witnesses to travel to a tribal court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In re Adoption of S.S. &amp; R.S. |vol=657 |reporter=N.E.2d |opinion=935 |pinpoint= |court=Ill. |date=1995 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or
*The parents of an Indian child over the age of 5 are not available and the child has had little or no contact with the tribe.
The BIA has also set out factors that state courts may ''not'' consider when determining whether good cause exists. These are binding regulations, effective as of December 12, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|25|23|118}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USFR|81|38802}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prohibited factors are:
*Whether the proceeding is at an advanced stage, if the Indian parent, custodian, or tribe did not receive notice of the proceeding until an advanced stage;
*Whether there have been prior proceedings involving the child in which transfer was not requested;
*Whether transfer could affect the placement of the child;
*The child's cultural connections with the tribe or its reservation; or
*Socioeconomic conditions or negative perceptions of tribal social services or judicial systems.

===Existing Indian Family Exception===

====History of the Exception====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:File-Indian Backword class child.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Indian Backwordclass child]] --&gt;
In 1982, the [[Kansas Supreme Court]] held that the ICWA " was not to dictate that an illegitimate infant who has never been a member of an Indian home or culture, and probably never would be, should be removed from its primary cultural heritage and placed in an Indian environment over the express objections of its non-Indian mother."&lt;ref name=SCOKBabyL&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In re Baby Boy L. |vol=643 |reporter=P.2d |opinion=168 |pinpoint= |court=Kan. |date=1982 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the facts of the case, the court stated that the ICWA did not apply unless the child was part of an "existing Indian family unit."  The court denied the [[Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma]] the right to intervene in the case, stating that the ICWA did not apply. The court also held that even if the ICWA did apply,  the trial court committed no [[harmless error|reversible error]] because the non-Indian mother would have objected to the transfer of the case to a tribal court and, thus, defeated the transfer.&lt;ref name=SCOKBabyL /&gt;

From the Kansas Supreme Court case sprang a body of jurisprudence around the "existing Indian family" exception to ICWA.  In the years following the Kansas ''Baby Boy L.'' case, approximately half of the states adopted or expanded upon this "existing Indian family" exception, despite the fact that the language appeared nowhere in the text of the ICWA.&lt;ref name=NARF1&gt;A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act, p. 1-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewerenz&gt;Lewerenz, Dan; McCoy, Padraic (2010) "The End of "Existing Indian Family" Jurisprudence: Holyfield at 20, In the Matter of A.J.S., and the Last Gasps of a Dying Doctrine," 36 Wm.Mit.L.R. 684 (William Mitchell College of Law)&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to the Kansas ''Baby Boy L.'' case, in 1989, the [[United States Supreme Court]] heard ''[[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield]].'' {{ussc|490|30|1989}}&lt;ref name=SCOTUS&gt;Like the ''Baby Boy L.'' case, ''[[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield]]''{{ussc|490|30|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the ''Baby Boy L.'' case, both parents in ''Holyfield'' consented to the voluntary termination of their parental rights and adoption of their infant by a non-Indian family.  Unlike the parents in ''Baby Boy L.'', the mother in this case lived on the reservation both before and after the birth of the child off-reservation.  The Supreme Court found that the child was "domiciled" on the reservation because its biological mother was domiciled on the reservation. Therefore, the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribal court under ICWA should have been invoked.  The case was remanded to the tribal court for a custody determination three years after the child had been placed with non-Indian adoptive parents.   Noting the potential disruption in the child's life, the Supreme Court noted that any potential harm could have been avoided if the parents and state court had not wrongfully denied the tribe its rights under ICWA.&lt;ref name=SCOTUS/&gt;

While the Supreme Court did not consider the "existing Indian family" exception, some sources cite ''Holyfield'' as an implicit  rejection of  the exception.&lt;ref name=NARF1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewerenz /&gt;&lt;ref name=JonesTilden30&gt;Jones, The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;  Other sources have noted that the ''Holyfield'' case is relied upon as support for both sides of the debate over the "existing Indian family" exception:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Surprisingly, ''Holyfield'' has been relied upon by courts and parties both to support and reject the existing Indian family exception, which has been invoked in proceedings involving Indian children and families who are living off the reservation and who are, therefore, subject to state court jurisdiction concurrent with that of the tribal court.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Toni Hahn (1993) "The Existing Indian Family Exception to the Indian Child Welfare Act," 69 N. Dak. L. Rev. 465 (University of North Dakota School of Law)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of 2010, [[Alabama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=S.A. v. E.J.P. |vol=571 |reporter=So.2d |opinion=1187 |pinpoint= |court=Ala. Civ.

Alabama and Indiana have limited its application by further court decisions.&lt;ref name=Lewerenz /&gt;  Nineteen states have rejected the doctrine, either by court decision or statute, including Kansas, where the Kansas Supreme Court expressly overturned the ''Baby L.'' decision in ''In re A.J.S.'', stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Given all of the foregoing, we hereby overrule Baby Boy L., (citation omitted), and abandon its existing Indian family doctrine. Indian heritage and the treatment of it has a unique history in United States law. A.J.S. has both Indian and non-Indian heritage, and courts are right to resist essentializing any ethnic or racial group. However, ICWA's overall design, including its "good cause" threshold in 25 U.S.C. 1915, ensures that all interests—those of both natural parents, the tribe, the child, and the prospective adoptive parents—are appropriately considered and safeguarded. ICWA applies to this state court child custody proceeding involving A.J.S., and the Cherokee Nation must be permitted to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In re A.J.S. |vol=204 |reporter=P.3d |opinion=543 |pinpoint= |court=Kan. |date=2009 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In June 2016, the Department of Interior specifically rejected the existing Indian family exception.&lt;ref&gt;81 Fed. Reg. 38801-2 (June 14, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations reflect not only that courts who rejected the doctrine were correct to do so, but also that "Congress did not intend to limit ICWA's applicability to those Tribal citizens actively involved in Indian culture." &lt;ref&gt;81 Fed. Reg. 38802 (June 14, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms====
Some critics have complained that the existing Indian family exception requires the state court to determine what it means to be an Indian child or an Indian family, by applying tests to determine the "Indian-ness" of the child.  One such test involved evaluating if the child lived "in an 'actual Indian dwelling,' apparently thinking of a teepee, hogan, or pueblo."&lt;ref name=Johnson398&gt;Johnson, Kevin R., p. 398&lt;/ref&gt;  Another work notes that "state courts have taken it upon themselves to determine individuals' relationship with their tribes by examining such contacts as subscription to a tribal newsletter."&lt;ref name=Lemont125&gt;Lemont, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 1997 testimony before the Joint Hearing of the [[House Resources Committee]] and the [[Senate Committee on Indian Affairs]], Assistant Secretary of the Interior [[Ada Deer]] ([[Menominee|Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin]]) stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... we want to express our grave concern that the objectives of the ICWA continue to be frustrated by State court created judicial exceptions to the ICWA. We are concerned that State court judges who have created the "existing Indian family exception" are delving into the sensitive and complicated areas of Indian cultural values, customs and practices which under existing law have been left exclusively to the judgment of Indian tribes ... We oppose any legislative recognition of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indian.senate.gov/hearings/618_ada.htm |title=Statement of Ada E.

===Foster Care Placement and Adoption===
"Foster care placement" is defined as "any action removing an Indian child from its parent or Indian custodian for temporary placement in a foster home or institution or the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent or Indian custodian cannot have the child returned upon demand, but where parental rights have not been terminated".&lt;ref name=ICWA1903 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF86&gt;A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act, p. 86-89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl==

The Supreme Court issued a decision pertaining to the ICWA in the case ''[[Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl]]'', on June 25, 2013.  In a 5-4 opinion delivered by Justice [[Samuel Alito]], the Supreme Court held that the heightened standard required under § 1912(f) of ICWA does not apply when the parent in question never had physical or legal custody of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What the Court's 'Baby Veronica' Ruling Means for Fathers and Native Americans|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/06/what-the-courts-baby-veronica-ruling-means-for-fathers-and-native-americans/277215/|publisher=The Atlantic|last=Cohen|first=Andrew|date=25 June 2013|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In re Alexandria P.==
In 2017 the Supreme Court declined to intervene in the case of a Choctaw girl in a jurisdiction case involving the girl's relatives and a non Indian couple who tried to adopt the girl in question&lt;ref&gt;[https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/culture/social-issues/icwa-supreme-court-denies-hearing-lexi-case/ Indian Country Today January 13,2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==ICWA in popular culture==

[[Barbara Kingsolver]]'s  1994 [[novel]] ''[[Pigs in Heaven]]'' deals with ICWA and its impact on Native American children and their adoptive parents.

'''Industrial ecology''' ('''IE''') is the study of [[material flow|material]] and [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flows]] through industrial systems.  The [[global economy|global]] [[industrial economy]] can be modelled as a network of industrial processes that extract resources from the [[Earth]] and transform those resources into [[Commodity|commodities]] which can be bought and sold to meet the needs of humanity.  Industrial ecology seeks to quantify the material flows and document the industrial processes that make modern society function.  Industrial ecologists are often concerned with the impacts that industrial activities have on the [[Natural environment|environment]], with use of the planet's supply of [[natural resources]], and with problems of [[waste disposal]].  Industrial ecology is a young but growing multidisciplinary field of research which combines aspects of [[engineering]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[toxicology]] and the [[Outline of natural science|natural sciences]].

Industrial ecology has been defined as a "systems-based, multidisciplinary discourse that seeks to understand emergent behaviour of complex integrated human/natural systems".&lt;ref name="OntologiesOfIE"/&gt;  The field approaches issues of [[sustainability]] by examining problems from multiple perspectives, usually involving aspects of sociology, the [[natural environment|environment]], [[economy]] and [[technology]].  The name comes from the idea that the analogy of natural systems should be used as an aid in understanding how to design sustainable industrial systems.&lt;ref name="StrategiesForManufacturing"/&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:IndustrialSymbiosisWasteHeatExchange.png|250px|right|thumb|Example of [[Industrial Symbiosis]].  Waste steam from a [[Waste incineration|waste incinerator]] (right) is piped to an [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol plant]] (left) where it is used as in input to their production process.]]
Industrial ecology is concerned with the shifting of industrial process from linear (open loop) systems, in which resource and capital investments move through the system to become waste, to a closed loop system where wastes can become inputs for new processes.

Much of the research focuses on the following areas:&lt;ref name="is4ieHistory"/&gt;
* [[Material flow analysis|material]] and energy flow studies ("[[industrial metabolism]]")
* [[dematerialization (economics)|dematerialization]] and [[Low-carbon economy|decarbonization]]
* technological change and the environment
* [[life cycle assessment|life-cycle planning, design and assessment]]
* [[Design for Environment|design for the environment ("eco-design")]]
* [[Extended producer responsibility| extended producer responsibility ("product stewardship")]]
* [[Eco-industrial park| eco-industrial parks ("industrial symbiosis") ]]
* product-oriented environmental policy
* [[eco-efficiency]]

Industrial ecology seeks to understand the way in which industrial systems (for example a factory, an [[ecoregion]], or national or global economy) interact with the [[biosphere]].  Natural ecosystems provide a metaphor for understanding how different parts of industrial systems interact with one another, in an "ecosystem" based on resources and [[infrastructural capital]] rather than on [[natural capital]]. It seeks to exploit the idea that natural systems do not have waste in them to inspire [[sustainable design]].

Along with more general [[energy conservation]] and material conservation goals, and redefining [[commodity markets]] and [[product stewardship]] relations strictly as a [[service economy]], industrial ecology is one of the four objectives of [[Natural Capitalism]].  This strategy discourages forms of amoral purchasing arising from ignorance of what goes on at a distance and implies a [[political economy]] that values [[natural capital]] highly and relies on more [[instructional capital]] to design and maintain each unique industrial ecology.

==History==
[[File:View from Asnaes power station Kalundborg Denmark.jpg|300px|right|thumb|View of [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park]]]]
{{Main|History of industrial ecology}}

Industrial ecology was popularized in 1989 in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article by [[Robert Frosch]] and Nicholas E. Gallopoulos.  Frosch and Gallopoulos' vision was "why would not our industrial system behave like an [[ecosystem]], where the wastes of a species may be [[natural resource|resource]] to another species? Why would not the outputs of an industry be the inputs of another, thus reducing use of [[raw material]]s, [[pollution]], and saving on [[waste]] treatment?"&lt;ref name="StrategiesForManufacturing"/&gt;  A notable example resides in a Danish industrial park in the city of [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park|Kalundborg]].  Here several linkages of [[byproduct]]s and [[waste heat]] can be found between numerous entities such as a large power plant, an oil refinery, a pharmaceutical plant, a plasterboard factory, an enzyme manufacturer, a waste company and the city itself.&lt;ref name="KalundborgCentre"/&gt; Another example is the Rantasalmi EIP in Rantasalmi, Finland. While this country has had previous organically formed EIP's, the park at Rantasalmi is Finland's first planned EIP.

The scientific field Industrial Ecology has grown quickly in recent years. The Journal of Industrial Ecology (since 1997), the [[International Society for Industrial Ecology]] (since 2001), and the journal Progress in Industrial Ecology (since 2004) give Industrial Ecology a strong and dynamic position in the international scientific community.  Industrial Ecology principles are also emerging in various policy realms such as the concept of the [[Circular Economy]] that is being promoted in China. Although the definition of the Circular Economy has yet to be formalized, generally the focus is on strategies such as creating a circular flow of materials, and cascading energy flows. An example of this would be using waste heat from one process to run another process that requires a lower temperature. The hope is that strategy such as this will create a more efficient economy with fewer pollutants and other unwanted by-products.&lt;ref name="CircularEconomy"/&gt;

== Principles ==
One of the central principles of Industrial Ecology is the view that societal and technological systems are bounded within the [[biosphere]], and do not exist outside it.  [[Ecology]] is used as a ''metaphor'' due to the observation that natural systems reuse materials and have a largely closed loop cycling of nutrients.  Industrial Ecology approaches problems with the hypothesis that by using similar principles as ''natural systems, industrial systems'' can be improved to reduce their impact on the natural environment as well. The table shows the general metaphor.

IE examines societal issues and their relationship with both technical systems and the environment. Through this ''[[holistic]] view '', IE recognizes that solving problems must involve understanding the connections that exist between these systems, various aspects cannot be viewed in isolation. Often changes in one part of the overall [[system]] can propagate and cause changes in another part. Thus, you can only understand a problem if you look at its parts in relation to the whole. Based on this framework, IE looks at environmental issues with a ''[[systems thinking]]'' approach. A good IE example with these societal impacts can be found at the [[Blue Lagoon (geothermal spa)|Blue Lagoon]] in Iceland. The Lagoon uses super-heated water from a local geothermal power plant to fill mineral-rich basins that have become recreational healing centers. In this sense the industrial process of energy production uses its wastewater to provide a crucial resource for the dependent recreational industry.

Take a city for instance. A city can be divided into commercial areas, residential areas, offices, services, infrastructures, and so forth. These are all sub-systems of the 'big city’ system. Problems can emerge in one sub-system, but the solution has to be global. Let’s say the price of housing is rising dramatically because there is too high a demand for housing. One solution would be to build new houses, but this will lead to more people living in the city, leading to the need for more infrastructure like roads, schools, more supermarkets, etc. This system is a simplified interpretation of reality whose behaviors can be ‘predicted’.

In many cases, the systems IE deals with are complex systems. [[Complex systems|Complexity]] makes it difficult to understand the behavior of the system and may lead to rebound effects. Due to unforeseen behavioral change of users or consumers, a measure taken to improve environmental performance does not lead to any improvement or may even worsen the situation.

Moreover, ''life cycle thinking'' is also a very important principle in industrial ecology. It implies that all environmental impacts caused by a product, system, or project during its life cycle are taken into account. In this context life cycle includes
*[[Raw material]] extraction
*[[Material processing]]
*Manufacture
*Use
*Maintenance
*Disposal
The transport necessary between these stages is also taken into account as well as, if relevant, extra stages such as [[reuse]], [[Remanufacturing|remanufacture]], and [[recycle]].
Adopting a life cycle approach is essential to avoid shifting environmental impacts from one life cycle stage to another. This is commonly referred to as problem shifting. For instance, during the re-design of a product, one can choose to reduce its weight, thereby decreasing use of resources. However, it is possible that the lighter materials used in the new product will be more difficult to dispose of. The environmental impacts of the product gained during the extraction phase are shifted to the disposal phase. Overall environmental improvements are thus null.

A final important principle of IE is its ''integrated approach'' or ''[[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinarity]]''. IE takes into account three different disciplines: social sciences (including economics), technical sciences and environmental sciences. The challenge is to merge them into a single approach.

==Examples==
The [[Kalundborg]] industrial park is located in Denmark. This industrial park is special because companies reuse each other's waste (which then becomes by-products). For example, the Energy E2 [[Asnæs Power Station]] produces [[gypsum]] as a by-product of the electricity generation process; this gypsum becomes a resource for the BPB Gyproc A/S which produces plasterboards.&lt;ref name="KalundborgCentre"/&gt; This is one example of a system inspired by the biosphere-technosphere metaphor: in ecosystems, the waste from one organism is used as inputs to other organisms; in industrial systems, waste from a company is used as a resource by others.

Apart from the direct benefit of incorporating waste into the loop, the use of an eco-industrial park can be a means of making renewable energy generating plants, like [[Photovoltaic system|Solar PV]], more economical and environmentally friendly. In essence, this assists the growth of the [[renewable energy industry]] and the environmental benefits that come with replacing fossil-fuels.&lt;ref name="PearcePhotovoltaic"/&gt;

Additional examples of industrial ecology include:
*Substituting the fly ash byproduct of coal burning practices for cement in concrete production&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Michael. "Optimizing the Use of Fly Ash in Concrete." Portland Cement Association&lt;/ref&gt;
*Using second generation biofuels. An example of this is converting grease or cooking oil to biodiesels to fuel vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.extension.org/pages/28000/used-and-waste-oil-and-grease-for-biodiesel|title=Used and Waste Oil and Grease for Biodiesel - eXtension|author=|date=|website=extension.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*South Africa's National Cleaner Production Center (NCPC) was created in order to make the region's industries more efficient in terms of materials. Results of the use of sustainable methods will include lowered energy costs and improved waste management. The program assesses existing companies to implement change.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncpc.co.za&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future directions==
The [[ecosystem]] metaphor popularized by [[Robert Frosch|Frosch]] and Gallopoulos&lt;ref name="StrategiesForManufacturing" /&gt; has been a valuable creative tool for helping researchers look for novel solutions to difficult problems.  Recently, it has been pointed out that this metaphor is based largely on a model of classical ecology, and that advancements in understanding ecology based on [[complexity science]] have been made by researchers such as [[C. S. Holling]], [[James J. Kay]],&lt;ref name="OnComplexityTheory"/&gt; and further advanced in terms of contemporary ecology by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levine | first1 = S.

.&lt;ref name="ABMAndIE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ApplyingABMinIE"/&gt;

[[Exergy]] analysis is performed in the field of industrial ecology to use energy more efficiently.&lt;ref name="ExergyUsefulConcept"/&gt; The term ''exergy'' was coined by [[Zoran Rant]] in 1956, but the concept was developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]]. In recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, [[ecological economics]], [[systems ecology]], and [[energetics]].

== Other examples ==

Another great example of industrial ecology both in practice and in potential is the Burnside Cleaner Production Centre in [[Burnside, Nova Scotia]]. They play a role in facilitating the 'greening' of over 1200 businesses that are located in Burnside, Eastern Canada's largest industrial park. The creation of waste exchange is a big part of what they work towards, which will promote strong industrial ecology relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newcity.ca/Pages/industrial_ecology.html|title=Industrial Ecology: From Theory to Practice|author=|date=|website=newcity.ca|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9854">In mathematics, a '''J-structure''' is an [[algebraic structure]] over a [[field (algebra)|field]] related to a [[Jordan algebra]].  The concept was introduced by {{harvtxt|Springer|1973}} to develop a theory of Jordan algebras using [[linear algebraic group]]s and axioms taking the Jordan inversion as basic operation and [[Hua's identity]] as a basic relation.  There is a classification of simple structures deriving from the classification of [[semisimple algebraic group]]s.  Over fields of [[characteristic of a field|characteristic]] not equal to 2, the theory of J-structures is essentially the same as that of Jordan algebras.

==Definition==
Let ''V'' be a [[finite-dimensional vector space]] over a field ''K'' and ''j'' a [[rational map]] from ''V'' to itself, expressible in the form ''n''/''N'' with ''n'' a [[polynomial map]] from ''V'' to itself and ''N'' a polynomial in ''K''[''V''].  Let ''H'' be the subset of GL(''V'') × GL(''V'') containing the pairs (''g'',''h'') such that ''g''∘''j'' = ''j''∘''h'': it is a closed [[subgroup]] of the product and the projection onto the first factor, the set of ''g'' which occur, is the ''structure group'' of ''j'', denoted ''G'''(''j'').

A ''J-structure'' is a triple (''V'',''j'',''e'') where ''V'' is a vector space over ''K'', ''j'' is a [[birational map]] from ''V'' to itself and ''e'' is a non-zero element of ''V'' satisfying the following conditions.&lt;ref name=Spr10&gt;Springer (1973) p.10&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''j'' is a homogeneous birational [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] of degree −1
* ''j'' is regular at ''e'' and ''j''(''e'') = ''e''
* if ''j'' is regular at ''x'', ''e'' + ''x'' and ''e'' + ''j''(''x'') then
:&lt;math&gt; j(e+x) + j(e+j(x)) = e &lt;/math&gt;
* the orbit ''G'' ''e'' of ''e'' under the structure group ''G'' = ''G''(''j'') is a [[Zariski open]] subset of ''V''.

The ''norm'' associated to a J-structure (''V'',''j'',''e'') is the numerator ''N'' of ''j'', normalised so that ''N''(''e'') = 1.  The ''degree'' of the J-structure is the degree of ''N'' as a homogeneous polynomial map.&lt;ref name=Spr11&gt;Springer (1973) p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''quadratic map'' of the structure is a map ''P'' from ''V'' to End(''V'') defined in terms of the [[Differential (mathematics)#Algebraic geometry|differential]] d''j'' at an invertible ''x''.&lt;ref name=Spr16&gt;Springer (1973) p.16&lt;/ref&gt;  We put
:&lt;math&gt;P(x) = - (d j)_x^{-1} . &lt;/math&gt;

The quadratic map turns out to be a quadratic polynomial map on ''V''.

The subgroup of the structure group ''G'' generated by the invertible quadratic maps is the ''inner structure group'' of the J-structure.  It is a closed connected normal subgroup.&lt;ref name=Spr18&gt;Springer (1973) p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

==J-structures from quadratic forms==
Let ''K'' have [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] not equal to 2. Let ''Q'' be a [[quadratic form]] on the vector space ''V'' over ''K'' with associated [[bilinear form]] ''Q''(''x'',''y'') = ''Q''(''x''+''y'') − ''Q''(''x'') − ''Q''(''y'') and distinguished element ''e'' such that ''Q''(''e'',.) is not trivial.  We define a reflection map ''x''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt; x^* = Q(x,e)e - x &lt;/math&gt;

and an inversion map ''j'' by

:&lt;math&gt; j(x) = Q(x)^{-1} x^* . &lt;/math&gt;

Then (''V'',''j'',''e'') is a J-structure.

===Example===
Let ''Q'' be the usual sum of squares quadratic function on ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; for fixed integer ''r'', equipped with the [[standard basis]] ''e''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,...,''e''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then (''K''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''Q'', ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;) is a J-structure of degree 2.  It is denoted O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Spr33&gt;Springer (1973) p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Link with Jordan algebras==
In [[characteristic of a field|characteristic]] not equal to 2, which we assume in this section, the theory of J-structures is essentially the same as that of Jordan algebras.

Let ''A'' be a finite-dimensional commutative [[non-associative algebra]] over ''K'' with identity ''e''.   Let ''L''(''x'') denote multiplication on the left by ''x''.  There is a unique birational map ''i'' on ''A'' such that ''i''(''x'').''x'' = ''e'' if ''i'' is regular on ''x'': it is homogeneous of degree −1 and an involution with ''i''(''e'') = ''e''.  It may be defined by ''i''(''x'') = ''L''(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.''e''.  We call ''i'' the ''inversion'' on ''A''.&lt;ref name=Spr66&gt;Springer (1973) p.66&lt;/ref&gt;

A Jordan algebra is defined by the identity&lt;ref name=Sch91&gt;Schafer (1995) p.91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oku13&gt;Okubo (2005) p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; x(x^2 y) = x^2 (x y) . &lt;/math&gt;

An alternative characterisation is that for all invertible ''x'' we have

:&lt;math&gt; x^{-1}(x y) = x (x^{-1} y) . &lt;/math&gt;

If ''A'' is a Jordan algebra, then (''A'',''i'',''e'') is a J-structure.  If (''V'',''j'',''e'') is a J-structure, then there exists a unique Jordan algebra structure on ''V'' with identity ''e'' with inversion ''j''.

==Link with quadratic Jordan algebras==
In general characteristic, which we assume in this section, J-structures are related to [[quadratic Jordan algebra]]s.  We take a quadratic Jordan algebra to be a finite dimensional vector space ''V'' with a quadratic map ''Q'' from ''V'' to End(''V'') and a distinguished element ''e''.  We let ''Q'' also denote the bilinear map ''Q''(''x'',''y'') = ''Q''(''x''+''y'') − ''Q''(''x'') − ''Q''(''y'').  The properties of a quadratic Jordan algebra will be&lt;ref name=Spr72&gt;Springer (1973) p.72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McC83&gt;McCrimmon (2004) p.83&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Q''(''e'') = id&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Q''(''x'',''e'')''y'' = ''Q''(''x'',''y'')''e''
* ''Q''(''Q''(''x'')''y'') = ''Q''(''x'')''Q''(''y'')''Q''(''x'')
* ''Q''(''x'')''Q''(''y'',''z'')''x'' = ''Q''(''Q''(''x'')''y'',''x'')''z''

We call ''Q''(''x'')''e'' the ''square'' of ''x''.  If the squaring is [[dominant morphism|dominant]] (has [[Zariski dense]] image) then the algebra is termed ''separable''.&lt;ref name=Spr74&gt;Springer (1973) p.74&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a unique birational involution ''i'' such that ''Q''(''x'')''i'' ''x'' = ''x'' if ''Q'' is regular at ''x''.  As before, ''i'' is the ''inversion'', definable by ''i''(''x'') = ''Q''(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''x''.

If (''V'',''j'',''e'') is a J-structure, with quadratic map ''Q'' then (''V'',''Q'',''e'') is a quadratic Jordan algebra.  In the opposite direction, if (''V'',''Q'',''e'') is a separable quadratic Jordan algebra with inversion ''i'', then (''V'',''i'',''e'') is a J-structure.&lt;ref name=Spr76&gt;Springer (1973) p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

===H-structure===
McCrimmon proposed a notion of ''H-structure'' by dropping the density axiom and strengthening the third (a form of Hua's identity) to hold in all [[Mutation (algebra)|isotopes]].  The resulting structure is categorically equivalent to a quadratic Jordan algebra.&lt;ref name=McC1977&gt;McCrimmon (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McC1978&gt;McCrimmon (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peirce decomposition==
A J-structure has a [[Peirce decomposition]] into subspaces determined by idempotent elements.&lt;ref name=Spr90&gt;Springer (1973) p.90&lt;/ref&gt;  Let ''a'' be an idempotent of the J-structure (''V'',''j'',''e''), that is, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''.  Let ''Q'' be the quadratic map.  Define

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_a(t,u) = Q(ta + u(e-a)) . &lt;/math&gt;

This is invertible for non-zero ''t'',''u'' in ''K'' and so φ defines a morphism from the [[algebraic torus]] GL&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × GL&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to the inner structure group ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  There are subspaces

:&lt;math&gt; V_a = \left\lbrace{ x \in V : \phi_a(t,u) x = t^2 x }\right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; V'_a = \left\lbrace{ x \in V : \phi_a(t,u) x = tu x }\right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; V_{e-a} = \left\lbrace{ x \in V : \phi_a(t,u) x = u^2 x }\right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;

and these form a [[direct sum]] decomposition of ''V''.  This is the Peirce decomposition for the idempotent ''a''.&lt;ref name=Spr92&gt;Springer (1973) p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalisations==
If we drop the condition on the distinguished element ''e'', we obtain "J-structures without identity".&lt;ref name=Spr21&gt;Springer (1973) p.21&lt;/ref&gt;  These are related to [[isotope (Jordan algebra)|isotope]]s of Jordan algebras.&lt;ref name=Spr22&gt;Springer (1973) p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2628">'''Judicial deference''' is the condition of a court yielding or submitting its judgment to that of another legitimate party, such as the [[executive branch]] in the case of [[National security|national defense]]. It is most commonly found in countries, such as the United Kingdom, which lack an [[constitution#Entrenchment|entrenched constitution]], as the essential purpose of such documents is to limit the power of the [[legislature]].

== United Kingdom ==
In ''Regina v. Director of Public Prosecutions Ex Parte Kebeline and Others'' [1999], [[David Hope, Baron Hope of Craighead|Lord Hope]] explained that courts should "defer, on democratic grounds, to the considered opinion of the elected body as to where the balance is to be struck between the rights of the individual and the needs of society". Nevertheless, the doctrine has been criticised for representing a way in which the courts should act obediently to the [[British Parliament]] to uphold the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]].

However, any suggestions that the [[House of Lords]] was being unduly servile to Parliament were overturned by ''A v Home Secretary'' [2005]. In the case, detainees imprisoned without charge under section 23 of the [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]], on the grounds that they posed a threat to national security, appealed successfully against their detention. The court held that the powers of detention without charge had discriminatory impact (Articles 5 and 14 of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]]).

== United States ==
There are some examples of judicial deference in the United States, despite its entrenched constitution. For example, in [[immigration law]], the [[judiciary]] has historically sought to allow the explicit constitutional authority of the [[US Congress]]. An example is [[US Supreme Court]] decision ''Fiallo v. Bell'' (1977).

The same restraint is requested in [[foreign affairs]] as [[justiciability|not-judicable]] matters,&lt;ref&gt;Kirk A. Randazzo, ''Defenders of Liberty or Champions of Security? Federal Courts, the Hierarchy of Justice, and U.S. Foreign Policy'', 1438430477, 9781438430478, SUNY Press 	2010.&lt;/ref&gt; to safeguard the executive branch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12108">'''Kathleen Cecilia Nott''' [[FRSL]] (11 February 1905 – 20 February 1999) was a British poet, novelist, critic, philosopher and editor.

==Life==

Kathleen Nott was born in [[Camberwell]], [[London]]. Her father, Philip, was a lithographic printer, and her mother, Ellen, ran a boarding house in [[Brixton]]; Kathleen was their third daughter. She was educated at Mary Datchelor Girls' School (now closed), London, before attending [[King's College, London]]. She soon left King's College on an Open Exhibition scholarship to [[Somerville College]], [[Oxford]]. The scholarship was in English Literature, but on arriving at Oxford, Nott switched to [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE) in which she took a IVth in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford University Calendar, 1932'', p.283&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at Oxford that she met Christopher Bailey, an electronics and computer engineer, whom she was to marry in 1929. During the 1930s, Nott was a social worker and psychologist in the [[East End]] of London, an experience which would inspire her first novel, ''Mile End'' (1938), which is set in the area. Bailey's work took the couple to the [[Netherlands]], from which they escaped when the [[History of the Netherlands (1939-1945)|German army invaded in 1940]].

During the war, Nott and Bailey lived in [[Bournemouth]], and afterwards they moved to [[Sweden]].  Their marriage was dissolved in the 1950s, They had no children.

It was her book ''The Emperor's Clothes'' (1953), which drew Nott to the attention of a much wider audience. An [[atheism|atheist]], Nott attacked what she described as the "neo-scholasticism" of such dominant religious literary figures as [[TS Eliot|T.S. Eliot]] and [[CS Lewis|C.S. Lewis]].

In 1954, Nott began contributing book reviews to ''[[The Observer]]''; much of her critical work would appear in that newspaper.  Essays and reviews by Nott were also published by ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'', ''[[Partisan Review]]'', ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'', ''[[New Society]]'', ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Spectator]]''. Nott's last review for ''The Observer'' was published in 1986.  She also wrote extensively for the humanist and rationalist movement, and many of her articles were published in the ''Rationalist Annual'', ''Question'', and ''Humanist''.  She also translated books and articles.

In the early 1970s, Nott moved to [[Horsham]], where she lived with a friend. Later in the decade she moved in with one of her sisters in [[Thornton Heath]].

Nott was a member of [[the University Women's Club]] and the [[Society of Authors]].  In ''Who's Who'' she listed her recreations as playing the piano and gardening.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukwhoswho.com&lt;/ref&gt; She was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] in 1977.

Nott suffered from deafness and [[Parkinson's Disease]] in her later years. When she died, Nott was living at Wemyss Lodge Residential Home [[Swindon]], [[Wiltshire]].

==Critical reception==

''Mile End'' (1938), Nott's first novel, was reviewed by the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]''. The reviewer felt that there was "something a shade clinical, a trifle too scientifically tolerant or indulgent, in the view of humanity unfolded here", and found Nott's prose "sharply individual but perhaps a little too mannered in its intellectual precision."  Nevertheless, "she gives the impression of having entered with astonishing acuteness and subtlety of mind into the impulses of the Jewish temperament, the psychological sway of Jewish religious lore and messianic tradition, the alien intensities of the social and domestic mood of the ghetto." The reviewer concluded that it was "an admirably balanced story, which gains in narrative force and even in warmth as it advances." &lt;ref&gt;"East End Jewry" [review of ''Mile End'' by Kathleen Nott] ''Times Literary Supplement'', 3 December 1939, p.767.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nott's debut collection of poetry, ''Landscapes and Departures'' (1947) received a positive review in the ''Times Literary Supplement''. The reviewer said that although Nott was a "difficult poet", her "quality as a writer is immediately obvious", concluding that "In spite of the difficulty of her poems, Miss Nott deserves to be read. She has a rich, harsh and rather masculine talent, and every poem here is full of vigour." &lt;ref&gt;"An original poet" [Review of ''Landscapes and Departures'' by Kathleen Nott]. ''Times Literary Supplement'', 24 May 1947, p.254.&lt;/ref&gt;

==PEN==

Nott became involved in the writers' organisation [[International PEN|PEN]] in the 1950s, becoming editor (initially acting editor&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001429/142951eb.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;) of the organisation's journal, ''PEN Bulletin of Selected Books'' (later renamed ''PEN International''), in 1960. She held the post until 1988.

She was briefly President of PEN in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.englishpen.org/aboutenglishpen/pastpresidentsofenglishpen/&lt;/ref&gt; staying on as a vice-president until the end of her life.

==Humanism and rationalism==

Nott was a committed [[secular humanism|humanist]] and [[rationalism|rationalist]], as signalled by the publication of her controversial ''The Emperor's New Clothes'' (1953), Writing on the occasion of Nott's death, a [[National Secular Society]]'s former general secretary, Colin McCall, explained the significance of the book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
You need to realise the literary situation in post-war Britain to appreciate the importance of Kathleen Nott... This was a time when T.S. Eliot reigned supreme, not only as poet, but as critic; when Graham Greene, C.S. Lewis and Dorothy L. Sayers were, in their different ways, spreading dogmatic Christian orthodoxy; and when the ''Times Literary Supplement'' (January 22, 1954) said the acceptance of authority in matters of religious belief "is now once more an important constituent in European letters". It was the philosophical inadequacies of this "constituent" that Kathleen Nott had exposed in ''The Emperor's New Clothes''...&lt;ref&gt;McCall (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nott contributed chapters to [[H.J. Blackham]]'s collection of essays, ''Objections to Humanism'' (1963) (a humanist response to ''Objections to Christianity'' from the same publishers), and ''The Humanist Outlook'' (1968), edited by [[Alfred Jules Ayer|A.J. Ayer]].  In "Is Rationalism Sterile?", Nott wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To be too analytical, to demand explanations, reasons, and logical or moral justifications can, we know, destroy human trust and therefore human relations... Safeguarding, the longing for final reassurance characterizes all of us, rationalists and religious alike, and the prestige of objective truth is only an intellectual parallel... It seems to me that the 'theologians' on either side of the rationalist-supernaturalist controversy have become mere case-makers, primarily out for proofs. (Natural enough, no doubt, but meanwhile the riches of feeling, religious or human, have been flung out with the bath-water.) It looks as if some kinds of argument, whatever they appear to be about, can indeed be largely sterile because they are not really aimed at finding a synthesis, a solution, at making peace. They belong to a side, they are covert polemic, and they aim at victory. With warfare of all kinds, truth is indeed the first victim.&lt;ref&gt;Nott (1963, p.68)&lt;/ref&gt;

For Nott, rationalism "in the nineteenth-century dyed-in-the-wool sense of being almost wholly preoccupied with the question of the existence of God, and with rebutting any supernatural sanction for morality", is "sterile" &lt;ref&gt;Nott (1963, p.72)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;.  However, "I do not think that humanists have to be rationalists in the old sense.".&lt;ref&gt;Nott (1963, p.78)&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Humanism and the Arts", Nott said that "humanists of our time are not as strong as they should be on the meaning and value of art and the artist."  She also admitted that "as soon as I begin to write about Humanism or speak from a Humanist platform  I find myself in full retreat towards square nought. If someone does not ask me what or who is a humanist - I find I am asking myself - or the audience." &lt;ref&gt;Nott (1968, p.179).&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the theme of ''Is Rationalism Sterile'', Nott observes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Many humanists seem to be just non-Godists. All they seriously worry about is the mid-Victorian controversy and it is here that they seem irremovably stuck... the large mass of contemporary literature has made at least one thing clear: that on the subject of God's existence and of the supernatural there is no longer any possibility of reasoned communication.&lt;ref name="Nott 1968, p.180"&gt;Nott (1968, p.180)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Instead, Nott advocated that humanists should examine "the real possibilities of the real concrete human being." &lt;ref name="Nott 1968, p.180"/&gt;  She continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The job for the humanist is to try and extract the ''human'' values of religion, to separate them out from the theological languages in which they disguise themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Nott (1968, p.182)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nott was President of the [[Progressive League]] (1959-1961), and an honorary associate of the [[Rationalist Association|Rationalist Press Association]], from 1979 until her death in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke (2003, p.322)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kri-Kri, Samaria Gorge, Crete, female.jpg|thumb|left|Adult female in natural [[habitat]], Samaria Gorge National Park]]
The '''kri-kri''' (''Capra aegagrus cretica''), sometimes called the '''Cretan goat''', '''Agrimi''', or '''Cretan Ibex''', is a [[feral goat]] inhabiting the Eastern [[Mediterranean]], previously considered a [[subspecies]] of [[wild goat]]. The kri-kri is now found only on the island of [[Crete]], [[Greece]] and three small islands just offshore ([[Dia, Greece|Dia]], [[Thodorou]] and [[Agii Pantes]]). 

&lt;!-- [[File:Kri-kri 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Close-up of adult, [[Samaria Gorge]] National Park]] --&gt;
The kri-kri has a light brownish coat with a darker band around its neck. It has two horns that sweep back from the head. In the wild they are shy and avoid humans, resting during the day. The animal can leap some distance or climb seemingly sheer cliffs.

The kri-kri is not thought to be indigenous to Crete, most likely having been imported to the island during the time of the [[Minoan civilization]]. Nevertheless, it is found nowhere else and is therefore [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to Crete. It was once common throughout the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] but the peaks of the 2,400 m (8,000&amp;nbsp;ft) [[Lefka Ori|White Mountains]] of Western Crete are their last strongholds—particularly a series of almost vertical 900 m (3,000&amp;nbsp;ft) cliffs called 'the Untrodden'&amp;mdash;at the head of the [[Samaria Gorge]]. This mountain range, which hosts another 14 endemic animal species, is protected as a [[UNESCO]] [[Biosphere Reserve]]. In total, their range extends to the White Mountains, the Samaria National Forest and the islets of Dia, Thodorou, and Agii Pandes. Recently some were introduced onto two more islands.

By 1960, the kri-kri was under threat, with a population below 200. It had been the only meat available to mountain guerillas during the [[Germany|German]] occupation in [[World War II]]. Its status was one reasons why the Samaria Gorge became a [[national park]] in 1962. There are still only about 2,000 animals on the island and they are considered vulnerable: hunters still seek them for their tender meat, grazing grounds have become scarcer and disease has affected them. Hybridization is also a threat, as the population has interbred with ordinary goats. Hunting them is strictly prohibited.

[[File:Chlorite relief rhyton, Zakros, 1500-1450 BC, AMH, 135307.jpg|thumb|left|[[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] rhyton from the Palace of [[Zakros]], depicting a rocky landscape with Cretan goats.]]
[[Archaeological]] excavations have unearthed several depictions of the kri-kri. Some academics believe that the animal was worshiped during antiquity. On the island, males are often called 'agrimi' ({{lang-el|αγρίμι}}, i.e. 'the wild one'), while the name 'sanada' ({{lang-el|σανάδα}}) is used for the female. The kri-kri is a symbol of the island, much used in tourism marketing and official literature.

As molecular analyses demonstrate, the kri-kri is not, as previously thought, a distinct subspecies of wild goat. Rather, it is a [[feral]] [[domestic goat]], derived from the first stocks of goats domesticated in the [[Levant]] and other parts of the Eastern Mediterranean around 8000-7500 BCE. Therefore, it represents a nearly ten-thousand-year-old "snapshot" of the first domestication of goats.

In any case, the kri-kri is an emblem of Crete and has immense cultural significance there. Legally however, [[endangered species]] legislation would likely not apply (as this does not cover feral populations), but similar cases elsewhere have been covered under [[Cultural resources management|cultural heritage protection]] laws.

The '''Köppen climate classification''' is one of the most widely used [[climate classification]] systems. It was first published by the Russian [[List of climate scientists|climatologist]] [[Wladimir Köppen]] (1846-1940) in 1884,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Köppen |first=Wladimir |date=1884 |title=Die Wärmezonen der Erde, nach der Dauer der heissen, gemässigten und kalten Zeit und nach der Wirkung der Wärme auf die organische Welt betrachtet |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/koeppen.htm |trans-title=The thermal zones of the earth according to the duration of hot, moderate and cold periods and to the impact of heat on the organic world) |journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift |translator1-first=E. |translator1-last=Volken |translator2-first=S |translator2-last=Brönnimann |publication-date=2011 |volume=20 |issue=3|pages=351–360 |via=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/schweiz/mz/2011/00000020/00000003/art00009|bibcode=2011MetZe..20..351K |doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2011/105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rubel |first1=F. |last2=Kottek |first2=M |date=2011 |title=Comments on: 'The thermal zones of the Earth' by Wladimir Köppen (1884) |journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=361–365  |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/schweiz/mz/2011/00000020/00000003/art00010|bibcode=2011MetZe..20..361R |doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2011/0258 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with several later modifications by Köppen, notably in 1918 and 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Köppen |first=Wladimir |year=1918 |title=Klassification der Klimate nach Temperatur, Niederschlag and Jahreslauf |encyclopedia=Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen |volume=64 |pages=193–203, 243–248 |via=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/koeppen.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Köppen |first=Wladimir |year=1936 |title=Das geographische System der Klimate |trans-title=The geographic system of climates |section=C |editor1-last=Köppen |editor1-first=Wladimir |editor2-first=Rudolf |editor2-last=Geiger (publisher) |work=Handbuch der Klimatologie |volume=1 |publisher=Borntraeger |location=Berlin |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pdf/Koppen_1936.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the climatologist [[Rudolf Geiger]] (1954, 1961) introduced some changes to the classification system, which is thus sometimes called the '''Köppen–Geiger climate classification system.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |mode=CS1 |last=Geiger |first=Rudolf |date=1954 |title=Klassifikation der Klimate nach W. Köppen |trans-title=Classification of climates after W. Köppen |work=Landolt-Börnstein – Zahlenwerte und Funktionen aus Physik, Chemie, Astronomie, Geophysik und Technik, alte Serie |volume=3 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |pages=603–607}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |mode=CS1 |last=Geiger |first=Rudolf |date=1961 |title=Überarbeitete Neuausgabe von Geiger, R.: Köppen-Geiger / Klima der Erde}} (Wandkarte 1:16 Mill.) – Klett-Perthes, Gotha.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Köppen climate classification divides climates into five main climate groups, with each group being divided based on seasonal precipitation and temperature patterns. The five main groups are ''A'' (tropical), ''B'' (dry), ''C'' (temperate), ''D'' (continental), and ''E'' (polar). Each group and subgroup is represented by a letter. All climates are assigned a main group (the first letter). All climates except for those in the ''E'' group are assigned a seasonal precipitation subgroup (the second letter). For example, ''Af'' indicates a [[tropical rainforest climate]]. The system assigns a temperature subgroup for all groups other than those in the ''A'' group, indicated by the third letter for climates in ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'', and the second letter for climates in ''E''. For example, ''Cfb'' indicates an [[oceanic climate]] with warm summers as indicated by the ending ''b''. Climates are classified based on specific criteria unique to each climate type.&lt;ref name="kottek2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kottek|first1=Markus|last2=Grieser|first2=Jürgen|last3=Beck|first3=Christoph|last4=Rudolf|first4=Bruno|last5=Rubel|first5=Franz|title=World Map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification updated|journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift|date=2006|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–263|doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130|bibcode=2006MetZe..15..259K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Köppen designed the system based on his experience as a [[Botany|botanist]], so the main climate groups are based on the different variety of vegetation that grows in climates belonging to each group. In addition to identifying climates, the system can be used to analyze ecosystem conditions and identify the main types of vegetation within climates. Due to its link with the [[Flora|plant life]] of a region, the system is useful in predicting future changes in plant life within a region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beck |first1=Hylke E. |last2=Zimmermann |first2=Niklaus E. |last3=McVicar |first3=Tim R. |last4=Vergopolan |first4=Noemi |last5=Berg |first5=Alexis |last6=Wood |first6=Eric F. |title=Present and future Köppen-Geiger climate classification maps at 1-km resolution |journal=Scientific Data |date=30 October 2018 |volume=5 |pages=180214 |doi=10.1038/sdata.2018.214 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018214 |language=En |issn=2052-4463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Köppen climate classification system has been further modified, within the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system in the middle 1960s (revised in 1980). The Trewartha system sought to create a more refined middle [[latitude]] climate zone, which was one of the criticisms of the Köppen system (the C climate group was too broad).&lt;ref name="McKnight"&gt;{{cite book|title=Physical Geography: A Landscape Appreciation|last1=McKnight|first1=Tom L|last2=Hess|first2=Darrel|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2000|isbn=0-13-020263-0|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|chapter=Climate Zones and Types}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|200–1}}

The Köppen climate classification scheme divides climates into five main climate groups: ''A'' (tropical), ''B'' (dry), ''C'' (temperate), ''D'' (continental), and ''E'' (polar).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Koppen-climate-classification|title=Koppen climate classification {{!}} climatology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second letter indicates the seasonal precipitation type, while the third letter indicates the level of heat.&lt;ref name=hanschen&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hanschen.org/koppen/ |title=Köppen climate classification |last1=Chen |first1=Hans |last2=Chen |first2=Deliang |authorlink2=Chen Deliang |website=hanschen.org |language=en |access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Group A: Tropical (megathermal) climates

This type of climate has every month of the year with an average temperature of {{convert|18|°C|°F|1}} or higher, with significant precipitation.

* ''Af'' = [[Tropical rainforest climate]]; average precipitation of at least {{convert|60|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in every month.
* ''Am'' = [[Tropical monsoon climate]]; driest month (which nearly always occurs at or soon after the "winter" solstice for that side of the equator) with precipitation less than {{convert|60|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, but more than 4% the total annual precipitation.
* ''Aw'' or ''As'' = Tropical wet and dry or [[Tropical savanna climate|savanna]] climate; with the driest month having precipitation less than {{convert|60|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and less than 4% of the total annual precipitation.

'''Group B: Dry (arid and semiarid) climates

This type of climate is defined by little precipitation.

Multiply the average annual temperature in [[Celsius]] by 20, then add
:(a) 280 if 70% or more of the total precipitation is in the spring and summer months (April–September in the Northern Hemisphere, or October–March in the Southern), or
:(b) 140 if 30%–70% of the total precipitation is received during the spring and summer, or
:(c) 0 if less than 30% of the total precipitation is received during the spring and summer.

If the annual precipitation is less than 50% of this threshold, the classification is BW (arid: desert climate); if it is in the range of 50%–100% of the threshold, the classification is BS (semi-arid: steppe climate).

A third letter can be included to indicate temperature. Originally, h signified low-latitude climate (average annual temperature above {{convert|18|°C|°F|1}}) while k signified middle-latitude climate (average annual temperature below 18 °C), but the more common practice today, especially in the United States, is to use h to mean the coldest month has an average temperature above {{convert|0|°C|°F|0}} (or {{convert|-3|°C|°F|0}}), with k denoting that at least one month's averages below 0 °C (or {{convert|-3|°C|°F|0}}). The n is used to denote a climate characterized by frequent fog.&lt;ref name=Cereceda/&gt;&lt;ref name=gepchile&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122045953/http://www.gep.uchile.cl/Biodiversidad/medio_fisico/clima_01.html |archivedate=22 January 2018 |url=http://www.gep.uchile.cl/Biodiversidad/medio_fisico/clima_01.html |title=CLASIFICACIÓN CLIMÁTICA DE KÖPPEN |publisher=Universidad de Chile |language=Spanish |accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Inzunza&gt;{{cite web |last1=Inzunza |first1=Juan |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122051833/http://nimbus.com.uy/weather/Cursos/Curso_2006/Textos%20complementarios/Meteorologia%20descriptiva_Inzunza/cap15_Inzunza_Climas%20de%20Chile.pdf |archivedate=22 January 2018 |url=http://nimbus.com.uy/weather/Cursos/Curso_2006/Textos%20complementarios/Meteorologia%20descriptiva_Inzunza/cap15_Inzunza_Climas%20de%20Chile.pdf |title=Capitulo 15.

== Scheme ==

=== Group A: Tropical/megathermal climates ===
[[Tropical climate]]s are characterized by constant high temperatures (at sea level and low elevations); all 12 months of the year have average temperatures of 18 °C (64.4 °F)  or higher. They are subdivided as follows:

==== Tropical rainforest climate ====
{{main article|Tropical rainforest climate}}
All 12 months have an average precipitation of at least {{Convert|60|mm|abbr=on}}. These climates usually occur within 10° latitude of the [[equator]].  This climate is dominated by the [[doldrums]] low-pressure system all year round, so has no natural seasons in terms of thermal and moisture changes.&lt;ref name="McKnight" /&gt;

Some of the places with this climate are indeed uniformly and monotonously wet throughout the year (e.g., the northwest [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]], from [[Ecuador]] to [[Costa Rica]]; see, for instance, [[Andagoya]], [[Colombia]]), but in many cases, the period of higher sun and longer days is distinctly wettest (as at [[Palembang]], [[Indonesia]]) or the time of lower sun and shorter days may have more rain (as at [[Sitiawan]], [[Malaysia]]).

('''Note'''. The term [[season|aseasonal]] refers to the lack in the tropical zone of large differences in daylight hours and mean monthly (or daily) temperature throughout the year. Annual cyclic changes occur in the tropics, but not as predictably as those in the temperate zone, albeit unrelated to temperature, but to water availability whether as rain, mist, soil, or ground water. Plant response (e. g., [[phenology]]), animal (feeding, migration, reproduction, etc.), and human activities (plant sowing, harvesting, hunting, fishing, etc.) are tuned to this 'seasonality'. Indeed, in tropical South America and Central America, the 'rainy season' (and the 'high water season') is called [[rainy season|''invierno'']] or ''inverno'', though it could occur in the Northern Hemisphere summer; likewise, the 'dry season' (and 'low water season') is called [[dry season|''verano'']] or ''verão'', and can occur in the Northern Hemisphere winter).

==== Tropical monsoon climate ====
{{main article|Tropical monsoon climate}}
This type of climate results from the [[monsoon]] winds which change direction according to the seasons. This climate has a driest month (which nearly always occurs at or soon after the "winter" solstice for that side of the equator) with rainfall less than 60 mm, but more than {{frac|25}} the total annual precipitation.&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;{{rp|208}}

Most places that have this climate are found at the outer margins of the [[tropical]] zone from the low teens to the mid-20s latitudes, but occasionally an inner-tropical location (e.g., [[San Marcos, Antioquia]], [[Colombia]]) also qualifies. Actually, the [[Caribbean sea|Caribbean]] coast, eastward from the [[Gulf of Urabá]] on the [[Colombia]]–[[Panamá]] border to the [[Orinoco River]] delta, on the [[Atlantic Ocean]] (about 4,000 km), have long dry periods (the extreme is the ''BSh'' climate (see below), characterised by very low, unreliable precipitation, present, for instance, in extensive areas in the [[:es:Guajira Península|Guajira]], and [[Coro region|Coro]], western [[Venezuela]], the northernmost peninsulas in South America, which receive &lt;300 mm total annual precipitation, practically all in two or three months).

This condition extends to the [[Lesser Antilles]] and [[Greater Antilles]] forming the circum-Caribbean dry belt. The length and severity of the dry season diminishes inland (southward); at the latitude of the Amazon River—which flows eastward, just south of the [[Equator|equatorial line]]—the climate is ''Af''. East from the [[Andes]], between the dry, arid Caribbean and the ever-wet Amazon are the Orinoco River's [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|llanos]] or [[savanna]]s, from where this climate takes its name.

Sometimes ''As'' is used in place of ''Aw'' if the dry season occurs during the time of higher sun and longer days. This is the case in parts of [[Hawaii]], northwestern Dominican Republic, East Africa, and the Brazilian Northeastern Coast. In most places that have tropical wet and dry climates, however, the dry season occurs during the time of lower sun and shorter days because of [[rain shadow]] effects during the 'high-sun' part of the year.

=== Group B: Dry (desert and semi-arid) climates ===
{{main article|Desert climate|Semi-arid climate}}
These climates are characterized by actual precipitation less than a threshold value set equal to the [[potential evapotranspiration]].&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;{{rp|212}} The threshold value (in millimeters) is determined as:

Multiply the average annual temperature in °C by 20, then add (a) 280 if 70% or more of the total precipitation is in the high-sun half of the year (April through September in the Northern Hemisphere, or October through March in the Southern), or (b) 140 if 30%–70% of the total precipitation is received during the applicable period, or (c) 0 if less than 30% of the total precipitation is so received.

According to the modified Köppen classification system used by modern climatologists, total precipitation in the warmest six months of the year is taken as reference instead of the total precipitation in the high-sun half of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snow.cals.uidaho.edu/Clim_Map/koppen_criteria.htm |author=Critchfield, H.J. |year=1983 |edition=4 |title=Criteria for classification of major climatic types in modified Köppen system |publisher=University of Idaho |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930221104/http://snow.cals.uidaho.edu/Clim_Map/koppen_criteria.htm |archivedate=2009-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the annual precipitation is less than 50% of this threshold, the classification is ''BW'' (arid: [[desert climate]]); if it is in the range of 50%–100% of the threshold, the classification is ''BS'' (semi-arid: [[semi-arid climate|steppe climate]]).

A third letter can be included to indicate temperature. Originally, ''h'' signified low-latitude climate (average annual temperature above 18 °C) while ''k'' signified middle-latitude climate (average annual temperature below 18 °C), but the more common practice today, especially in the United States, is to use ''h'' to mean the coldest month has an average temperature above 0 °C (32 °F) (or {{convert|-3|°C|°F|0}}), with ''k'' denoting that at least one month averages below 0 °C.

Desert areas situated along the west coasts of continents at tropical or near-tropical locations are characterized by cooler temperatures than encountered elsewhere at comparable latitudes (due to the nearby presence of cold ocean currents) and frequent fog and low clouds, despite the fact that these places rank among the driest on earth in terms of actual precipitation received. This climate is sometimes labelled ''BWn''.&lt;ref name=Cereceda/&gt;&lt;ref name=gepchile/&gt;&lt;ref name=Inzunza/&gt; The ''BSn'' category can be found in foggy coastal steppes.&lt;ref name=Cereceda/&gt;&lt;ref name=gepchile/&gt;&lt;ref name=Inzunza/&gt;

On occasion, a fourth letter is added to indicate if either the winter or summer half of the year is "wetter" than the other half. To qualify, the wettest month must have at least {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}} of average precipitation if all 12 months are above 18 °C (64 °F), or {{convert|30|mm|abbr=on}} if not; plus at least 70% of the total precipitation must be in the same half of the year as the wettest month — but the letter used indicates when the 'dry' season occurs, not the 'wet' one. This would result in [[Khartoum]], Sudan, being reckoned as ''BWhw''; [[Niamey]], Niger, as ''BShw''; [[Alexandria]], Egypt, as ''BWhs''; [[Asbi'ah]], Libya, as ''BShs''; [[Ömnögovi Province]], Mongolia, as ''BWkw''; and [[Xining]], [[Qinghai]], China, as ''BSkw'' (''BWks'' and ''BSks'' do not exist if 0 °C in the coldest month is recognized as the ''h''/''k'' boundary.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}) If the standards for neither ''w'' nor ''s'' are met, no fourth letter is added.

=== Group C: Temperate/mesothermal climates ===
{{anchor|Group C}}
{{main article|Temperate climate}}
In the Koppen climate system, temperate climates are defined as having an average temperature above {{convert|0|°C|°F}} (or {{convert|-3|°C|°F|1}}, as noted previously) in their coldest month but below {{convert|18|°C|°F|1}}. The average temperature of {{convert|-3|°C|°F|1}} roughly coincides with the equatorward limit of frozen ground and snowcover lasting for a month or more.

The second letter indicates the precipitation pattern—''w'' indicates dry winters (driest winter month average precipitation less than one-tenth wettest summer month average precipitation. ''s'' indicates at least three times as much rain in the wettest month of winter as in the driest month of summer. ''f'' means significant precipitation in all seasons (neither above-mentioned set of conditions fulfilled).&lt;ref name=Beck /&gt;

The third letter indicates the degree of summer heat—''a'' indicates warmest month average temperature above {{convert|22|°C|°F|1}} while  ''b'' indicates warmest month averaging below 22 °C.

==== Mediterranean climates ====
{{main article|Mediterranean climate}}
These climates usually occur on the western sides of continents between the latitudes of 30° and 45°.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mediterranean Climate |author=Melvin R. George |work=UCRangelands |publisher=University of California |accessdate=2015-01-26 |url=http://californiarangeland.ucdavis.edu/Mediterranean_Climate/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304235950/http://californiarangeland.ucdavis.edu/Mediterranean_Climate/ |archive-date=2016-03-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These climates are in the polar front region in winter, and thus have moderate temperatures and changeable, rainy weather. Summers are hot and dry, due to the domination of the subtropical high pressure systems, except in the immediate coastal areas, where summers are milder due to the nearby presence of cold ocean currents that may bring [[fog]] but prevent rain.&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;{{rp|221–3}}

Dry-summer climates sometimes extend to additional areas (sometimes well north,  or south of) typical Mediterranean climates, however the warmest month mean does not reach {{convert|22|C|1}} they are classified as (''Csb'').&lt;ref name=Beck /&gt; Some of these areas would border the [[Oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''), except their dry-summer patterns meet Köppen's ''Cs'' minimum thresholds.

Cold-summer Mediterranean climates (''Csc'') exist in high-elevation areas adjacent to coastal ''Csb'' climate areas, where the strong maritime influence prevents the average winter monthly temperature from dropping below 0 °C. This climate is rare and is predominantly found in climate fringes and isolated areas of the Cascades and Andes Mountains, as the dry-summer climate extends further poleward in the Americas than elsewhere.&lt;ref name="McKnight" /&gt; Rare instances of this climate can be found in some coastal locations in the North Atlantic and at high altitudes in Hawaii.

* [[Haleakalā|Haleakalā Summit]], [[Hawaii]], United States (''Csc'')

==== Humid subtropical climates====
{{main article|Humid subtropical climate}}
These climates usually occur on the eastern coasts and eastern sides of continents, usually in the high 20s and 30s latitudes. Unlike the dry summer Mediterranean climates, humid subtropical climates have a warm and wet flow from the tropics that creates warm and moist conditions in the summer months. As such, summer (not winter as is the case in Mediterranean climates) is often the wettest season.
 
The flow out of the subtropical highs and the summer monsoon creates a southerly flow from the tropics that brings warm and moist air to the lower east sides of continents. This flow is often what brings the frequent but short-lived summer thundershowers so typical of the more southerly subtropical  climates like the far southern United States, southern China and Japan.&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;{{rp|223–6}}

==== Oceanic climate ====
{{main article|Oceanic climate}}
''Cfb'' climates usually occur in the higher middle latitudes on the western sides of continents between the latitudes of 40° and 60°; they are typically situated immediately poleward of the Mediterranean climates, although in Australia and extreme southern Africa this climate is found immediately poleward of temperate climates, and at a somewhat lower latitude. In western Europe, this climate occurs in coastal areas up to 63°N in Norway.
 
These climates are dominated all year round by the polar front, leading to changeable, often overcast weather. Summers are mild due to cool ocean currents, although hotter, stable weather patterns can set in for periods of time, typically longer at the lower latitude range in the northern hemisphere. Winters are milder than other climates in similar latitudes, but usually very cloudy however not always wet. ''Cfb'' climates are also encountered at high elevations in certain subtropical and tropical areas, where the climate would be that of a subtropical/tropical rain forest if not for the altitude. These climates are called "highlands".&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;{{rp|226–9}}

Subpolar oceanic climates (''Cfc'') occur poleward of or at higher elevations than the maritime temperate climates, and are mostly confined either to narrow coastal strips on the western poleward margins of the continents, or, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, to islands off such coasts. They occur in both hemispheres, most often at latitudes from 60° north and south to 70° north and south.&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;

==== Highland climates ====

Dry-winter highland climate (''Cwb'') is a type of climate mainly found in highlands inside the tropics of [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Madagascar]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]] or central Argentina and areas outside of the tropics (such as in the subtropics). Winters are noticeable and dry, and summers can be very rainy. In the tropics, the rainy season is provoked by the tropical air masses and the dry winters by subtropical high pressure.

'''Examples'''
* [[Da Lat]], [[Vietnam]] (''Cwb'')
* [[Shimla]], [[India]] (''Cwb'')
* [[Thimphu]], [[Bhutan]] (''Cwb'')
* [[Mokhotlong]], [[Lesotho]] (''Cwb'')

* [[Cusco]], [[Peru]] (''Cwb'')
* [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]] (''Cwb'' bordering on ''Cwc'')
* [[Salta]], [[Argentina]] (''Cwb'')
Highland climates with uniform rainfall (''Cfb'') are a type of oceanic climate mainly found in highlands of [[Australia]], such as in or around the [[Great Dividing Range]] in the states of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]], and also sparsely in other continents, such as in [[South America]], among others. Unlike a typical ''Cwb'' climate, they tend to have rainfall spread evenly throughout the year. They have characteristics of both the ''Cfb'' and ''Cfa'' climates. Though unlike these climates, they have a high [[diurnal temperature variation]] and low humidity, owing to their inland location and relatively high [[elevation]].

=== Group D: Continental/microthermal climates ===
{{Main article|Continental climate}}
[[File:Odori Park Sapporo Snow Festival 2007.JPG|thumb|right|The snowy city of [[Sapporo]]]]

These climates have an average temperature above 10 °C (50 °F) in their warmest months, and a coldest month average below 0 °C (or {{convert|-3|°C|°F|0}}, as noted previously). These usually occur in the interiors of continents and on their upper east coasts, normally north of 40°N. In the Southern Hemisphere, group D climates are extremely rare due to the smaller land masses in the middle latitudes and the almost complete absence of land at 40–60°S, existing only in some highland locations.

==== Hot summer continental climates ====

{{main article|Hot-summer humid continental climate}}
 
''Dfa'' climates usually occur in the high 30s and low 40s latitudes, with a qualifying average temperature in the warmest month of greater than 22 °C/72 °F. In Europe, these climates tend to be much drier than in North America. In eastern Asia, ''Dwa'' climates extend further south due to the influence of the Siberian high pressure system, which also causes winters there to be dry, and summers can be very wet because of [[monsoon]] circulation. ''Dsa'' exists at higher elevations adjacent to areas with hot summer Mediterranean (''Csa'') climates.&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;{{rp|231–2}}

==== Warm summer continental or hemiboreal climates ====
{{main article|Warm-summer humid continental climate}}
''Dfb'' and ''Dwb'' climates are immediately poleward of hot summer continental climates, generally in the high 40s and low 50s latitudes in North America and Asia, and also extending to higher latitudes in central and eastern Europe and Russia, between the maritime temperate and continental subarctic climates, where it extends up to 65 degrees latitude in places.&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;

''Dsb'' arises from the same scenario as ''Dsa'', but at even higher altitudes or latitudes, and chiefly in North America, since the Mediterranean climates extend further poleward than in Eurasia.

==== Subarctic or boreal climates ====
{{main article|Subarctic climate}}
''Dfc'', ''Dsc'' and ''Dwc'' climates occur poleward of the other group D climates, generally in the 50 and low 60 degrees of North latitude. In some places, it extends northward to beyond 70°N latitude.&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;{{rp|232–5}}

Places with this climate (''Dfd'', ''Dwd'', ''Dsd'') have severe winters, with the temperature in their coldest month lower than −38 °C. These climates occur only in eastern [[Siberia]]. The names of some of the places with this climate have become veritable synonyms for extreme, severe winter cold.

'''Examples'''
* [[Yakutsk]], [[Sakha Republic]], Russia (''Dfd'')
* [[Verkhoyansk]], Sakha Republic, Russia (''Dfd'')
* [[Amga (rural locality)|Amga]], Sakha Republic, Russia (''Dfd'')

=== Group E: Polar climates ===
In the Köppen climate system, polar climates are defined as the warmest temperature of any month is below 10 °C (50 °F). Polar climates are further divided into two types, tundra climates and icecap climates:

'''[[Tundra]] climate''' (''ET'' and ''ETf''): Warmest month has an average temperature between 0 and 10 °C. These climates occur on the northern edges of the North American and Eurasian land masses (generally north of 70 °N although it may be found farther south depending on local conditions), and on nearby islands. ''ET'' climates are also found on some islands near the Antarctic Convergence, and at high elevations outside the polar regions, above the tree line.

'''Examples'''
* [[Mount Rainier, Washington|Mount Rainier]], Washington, United States (''ET'')
* [[Macquarie Island]], Australia (''ET'')
* [[Crozet Islands]] (''ET'')
* [[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]], [[New Zealand]] (''ET'')
* [[Kerguelen Islands]] (''ET'')
* [[Prince Edwards Islands]] (''ET'')
* [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], [[Falkland Islands]] (''ET''), borders subpolar oceanic (''Cfc'')
* [[Ushuaia]], [[Argentina]] (''ET''), (borders on ''Cfc'')
* [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]], [[Tasmania]], [[Australia]] (''ET'')
* [[Nagqu]], [[Tibet]], China (''ET'')
* [[Letseng diamond mine]], [[Lesotho]] (''ET'', bordering on ''Cfc'' and ''Dfc'')
* [[La Rinconada, Peru|La Rinconada]], [[Peru]] (''ET'')
* [[Cairn Gorm]], [[United Kingdom]] (''ET'')

These climates are a colder and more continental variants of tundra. They would have characteristics of the ice cap climate, but still manage to see monthly average temperatures above 0 °C (32 °F):

'''Examples'''
* [[Nanortalik]], [[Greenland]] (''ETf'')
* [[Mount Fuji]], Japan (''ETf'')
* [[Murghab, Tajikistan]] (''ETf'')
* [[Mount Washington, New Hampshire|Mount Washington]], [[New Hampshire]], United States (''ETf'')
* [[Zugspitze]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]] (''ETf'')
* [[Eureka, Nunavut]], Canada (''ETf'')
* [[Iqaluit, Nunavut]], Canada (''ETf'')
* [[Inukjuak, Quebec]], Canada (''ETf'')
* [[Nuuk, Greenland|Nuuk]], [[Greenland]] (''ETf'', bordering on Dfc)
* [[Svalbard]], [[Norway]] (''ETf'')
* [[Mys Shmidta]], Russia (''ETf'')
* [[Dikson Island]], Russia (''ETf'')
* [[Nord, Greenland|Nord]], Greenland (''ETf'')
* [[Esperanza Base]], [[Antarctica]] (''ETf'')

'''[[Ice cap climate]]''' (''EF''): This climate is dominant in Antarctica and inner Greenland, but also occurs at extremely high altitudes on mountains, above even tundra. Monthly average temperatures never exceed 0 °C (32 °F) ((or {{convert|-3|°C|°F|0}}).

'''Examples'''
* [[Mount Ararat]], Turkey (''EF'')
* [[Grossglockner]], [[Carinthia]], [[Austria]] (''EF'')
* [[Mount Everest]], China/Nepal (''EF'')
* [[Summit Camp]], Greenland (''EF'')
* [[Scott Base]], [[Antarctica]] (''EF'')
* [[Vostok Station]], Antarctica (''EF''), location of the lowest air temperature ever recorded on Earth.
* [[McMurdo Station]], Antarctica (''EF'')
* [[Byrd Station]], Antarctica (''EF'')

Occasionally, a third, lower-case letter is added to ET climates (distinguishing between ETf, ETs, and ETw), if either the summer or winter is clearly drier than the other half of the year. When the option to include this letter is exercised, the same standards that are used for Groups C and D apply, with the additional requirement that the wettest month must have an average of at least 30 mm precipitation (Group E climates can be as dry or even drier than Group B climates based on actual precipitation received, but their rate of evaporation is much lower). Seasonal precipitation letters are almost never attached to EF climates, mainly due to the difficulty in distinguishing between falling and blowing snow, as snow is the sole source of moisture in these climates.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

== Ecological significance ==
The Köppen climate classification is based on the empirical relationship between climate and vegetation. This classification provides an efficient way to describe climatic conditions defined by temperature and precipitation and their seasonality with a single metric. Because climatic conditions identified by the Köppen classification are ecologically relevant, it has been widely used to map geographic distribution of long term climate and associated ecosystem conditions.&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Chen |first1=D. |first2=H. W. |last2=Chen| year=2013 | title=Using the Köppen classification to quantify climate variation and change: An example for 1901–2010 | journal=Environmental Development | volume=6 | pages=69–79 |doi=10.1016/j.envdev.2013.03.007 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211464513000328}} ''(direct: [http://hanschen.org/uploads/Chen_and_Chen_2013_envdev.pdf Final Revised Paper])''&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using the classification to identify changes in climate and potential changes in vegetation over time.&lt;ref name=hanschen/&gt; The most important ecological significance of the Köppen climate classification is that it helps to predict the dominant vegetation type based on the climatic data and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Critchfield |first1=Howard J |title=General Climatology |date=1983 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-81-203-0476-5 |pages=154–161 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a [[Nanjing University]] paper published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' analyzing climate classifications found that between 1950 and 2010, approximately 5.7% of all land area worldwide had moved from wetter and colder classifications to drier and hotter classifications. The authors also found that the change "cannot be explained as natural variations but are driven by anthropogenic factors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Chan, D. and Wu, Q. |title=Significant anthropogenic-induced changes of climate classes since 1950 |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=5 |number=13487 |doi=10.1038/srep13487 |date=2015 |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep13487|bibcode=2015NatSR...513487C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trewartha climate classification scheme ==
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2018}}
{{Main article|Trewartha climate classification}}
The Trewartha climate classification is a climate classification system published by American geographer Glenn Thomas Trewartha in 1966, and updated in 1980. It is a modified version of the 1899 Köppen system, created to answer some of the deficiencies of the Köppen system. The Trewartha system attempts to redefine the middle latitudes to be closer to vegetation zoning and genetic climate systems. It was considered a more true or "real world" reflection of the global climate.

For example, under the standard Köppen system, in the [[United States]], western [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]] are classed into the same climate zone as [[southern California]], even though the two regions have strikingly different weather and vegetation. Under the old Köppen system cool oceanic climates like that of [[London]] or [[Seattle]] were classed in the same zone as hot subtropical cities like [[Savannah, Georgia]] or [[Brisbane, Australia]]. In the United States, locations like [[Colorado]] and [[Iowa]] which have long, severe winter climates where plants are completely dormant, were classed into the same climate zone as [[Louisiana]] or northern [[Florida]] which have mild winters and a green winter landscape.

== Other Köppen climate maps ==
All maps use the ≥0 °C definition for temperate climates and the 18 °C annual mean temperature threshold to distinguish between hot and cold dry climates.&lt;ref name=Beck /&gt;

'''LGBT rights organizations''' are [[civil rights organization|civil rights]], [[healthcare and the LGBT community|health]], and [[community organization]]s created and existing to further the [[civil rights|civil]] and [[human rights]] and [[public health|health]] of [[sexual minorities]] and to improve the [[LGBT community]].

LGBT organizations may range from more moderate, liberal, organizations such as [[Stonewall (UK)]], to more outspoken organizations such as [[OutRage!]] in the U.K. and [[Bash Back!]] in the U.S., to the conservative, [[Log Cabin Republicans]], in the U.S..

==History of LGBT Rights Organizations==

{{Empty section|date=April 2017}}

==Early history==
The first LGBT rights organizations began to emerge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Early LGBT rights organizations were primarily research-oriented psychiatric organizations that took a sympathetic, rather than corrective approach to homosexuality. such as the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]] (Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee, WhK), which was founded in 1897 by [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], an outspoken advocate for LGBT and women's rights in Germany.&lt;ref name="morris-article"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morris|first1=Bonnie|title=History of Lesbian, Gay, &amp; Bisexual Social Movements|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/history.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth century==
===Early 20th Century===
Early LGBT organizations in the [[United States]] were, like earlier German organizations, primarily centered around the rights of gay men. [[The Society for Human Rights]] was founded in 1924 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] by Henry Gerber, who was inspired by Hirschfeld's work in Germany and produced the first gay-rights-oriented publication in the US, ''[[Friendship and Freedom]]''.  The first national gay rights organization, the [[Mattachine Society]], was formed in 1951,&lt;ref name="amerigan-orgs-timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=The American Gay Rights Movement|url=https://www.infoplease.com/us/gender-issues/american-gay-rights-movement-timeline|website=infoplease|publisher=Sandbox Networks, Inc.|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created by [[Harry Hay]].

The first lesbian rights organization in the US was founded in 1955. The [[Daughters of Bilitis]] was founded in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] by activist couple [[Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon]].&lt;ref name="amerigan-orgs-timeline" /&gt; In 1966, National Transsexual Counseling Unit was formed in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1966 The National Transgender Counseling Unit...|url=https://www.sutori.com/item/1966-the-national-transsexual-counseling-unit-the-worlds-first-transgender-orga|website=LGBTQ Timeline in the US|publisher=Sutori|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Stonewall===
In the wake of the [[Stonewall riots]], LGBT organizations began to flourish around the United States, including politically active organizations. The [[Alice B. Toklas LGBT Democratic Club]] was founded in 1971 by Martin &amp; Lyon, as well as activists Beth Elliot and Ben Foster. In 1976, [[Harvey Milk]] founded a splinter organization known as the [[Harvey Milk Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Democratic Club|San Francisco Gay Democratic Club]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="83202">{{About|axiomatic rules due to various logicians and philosophers|[[Boole]]'s book on logic|The Laws of Thought}}
The '''laws of thought''' are fundamental [[axiom]]atic rules upon which rational discourse itself is often considered to be based.  The formulation and clarification of such rules have a long tradition in the history of [[philosophy]] and [[logic]]. Generally they are taken as laws that guide and underlie everyone's thinking, [[thoughts]], expressions, discussions, etc. However, such classical ideas are often questioned or rejected in more recent developments, such as [[intuitionistic logic]], [[dialetheism]] and [[fuzzy logic]].

According to the 1999 Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;"Laws of thought".  Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy.  [[Robert Audi]], Editor,  Cambridge: Cambridge UP. p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt; laws of thought are laws by which or in accordance with which valid thought proceeds, or that justify valid inference, or to which all valid deduction is reducible. Laws of thought are rules that apply without exception to any subject matter of thought, etc.; sometimes they are said to be the object of logic{{explain|date=July 2018}}. The term, rarely used in exactly the same sense by different authors, has long been associated with three equally ambiguous expressions: the [[law of identity]] (ID), the [[law of contradiction]] (or non-contradiction; NC), and the [[law of excluded middle]] (EM).
Sometimes, these three expressions are taken as [[propositions]] of [[formal ontology]] having the widest possible subject matter, propositions that apply to entities as such: (ID), everything is (i.e., is identical to) itself; (NC) no thing having a given quality also has the negative of that quality (e.g., no even number is non-even); (EM) every thing either has a given quality or has the negative of that quality (e.g., every number is either even or non-even). Equally common in older works is the use of these expressions for principles of [[metalogic]] about propositions: (ID) every proposition implies itself; (NC) no proposition is both true and false; (EM) every proposition is either true or false.

Beginning in the middle to late 1800s, these expressions have been used to denote propositions of [[Boolean Algebra]] about classes: (ID) every class includes itself; (NC) every class is such that its intersection ("product") with its own complement is the null class; (EM) every class is such that its union ("sum") with its own complement is the universal class. More recently, the last two of the three expressions have been used in connection with the classical propositional logic and with the so-called [[protothetic]] or quantified [[propositional logic]]; in both cases the law of non-contradiction involves the negation of the conjunction ("and") of something with its own negation, ¬(A∧¬A), and the law of excluded middle involves the disjunction ("or") of something with its own negation, A∨¬A. In the case of propositional logic, the "something" is a schematic letter serving as a place-holder, whereas in the case of protothetic logic the "something" is a genuine variable. The expressions "law of non-contradiction" and "law of excluded middle" are also used for [[semantic]] principles of [[model theory]] concerning sentences and interpretations: (NC) under no interpretation is a given sentence both true and false, (EM) under any interpretation, a given sentence is either true or false.

The expressions mentioned above all have been used in many other ways. Many other propositions have also been mentioned as laws of thought, including the [[dictum de omni et nullo]] attributed to [[Aristotle]], the substitutivity of identicals (or equals) attributed to [[Euclid]], the so-called [[identity of indiscernibles]] attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and other "logical truths".

The expression "laws of thought" gained added prominence through its use by [[Boole]] (1815–64) to denote theorems of his "algebra of logic"; in fact, he named his second logic book ''An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities'' (1854). Modern logicians, in almost unanimous disagreement with Boole, take this expression to be a misnomer; none of the above propositions classed under "laws of thought" are explicitly about thought per se, a mental phenomenon studied by [[psychology]], nor do they involve explicit reference to a thinker or knower as would be the case in [[pragmatics]] or in [[epistemology]]. The distinction between psychology (as a study of mental phenomena) and logic (as a study of valid inference) is widely accepted.

==The three traditional laws==

===History===
[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]] offers a history of the three traditional laws that begins with [[Plato]], proceeds through Aristotle, and ends with the [[scholastic logic|schoolmen]] of the [[Middle Ages]]; in addition he offers a fourth law (see entry below, under '''Hamilton'''):

:"'''The principles of Contradiction and Excluded Middle can be traced back to Plato''': The principles of Contradiction and of Excluded Middle can both be traced back to Plato, by whom they were enounced and frequently applied; though it was not till long after, that either of them obtained a distinctive appellation. To take the principle of Contradiction first. This law Plato frequently employs, but the most remarkable passages are found in the Phœdo, in the Sophista, and in the fourth and seventh books of the Republic. [Hamilton LECT. V. LOGIC. 62]

:'''Law of Excluded Middle''': The law of Excluded Middle between two contradictories remounts, as I have said, also to Plato, though the Second Alcibiades, the dialogue in which it is most clearly expressed, must be admitted to be spurious. It is also in the fragments of Pseudo-Archytas, to be found in [[Stobaeus|Stobæus]]. [Hamilton LECT. V. LOGIC. 65]

:Hamilton further observes that "It is explicitly and emphatically enounced by Aristotle in many passages both of his Metaphysics (l. iii. (iv.) c.7.) and of his Analytics, both Prior (l. i. c. 2) and Posterior (1. i. c. 4). In the first of these, he says: "It is impossible that there should exist any medium between contradictory opposites, but it is necessary either to affirm or to deny everything of everything." [Hamilton LECT. V. LOGIC. 65]

:"'''Law of Identity.''' [Hamilton also calls this "The principle of all logical affirmation and definition"] '''Antonius Andreas''': The law of Identity, I stated, was not explicated as a coordinate principle till a comparatively recent period. The earliest author in whom I have found this done, is [[Antonius Andreas]], a scholar of Scotus, who flourished at the end of the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth century. The schoolman, in the fourth book of his Commentary of Aristotle's Metaphysics – a commentary which is full of the most ingenious and original views, – not only asserts to the law of Identity a coordinate dignity with the law of Contradiction, but, against Aristotle, he maintains that the principle of Identity, and not the principle of Contradiction, is the one absolutely first. The formula in which Andreas expressed it was ''Ens est ens''. Subsequently to this author, the question concerning the relative priority of the two laws of Identity and of Contradiction became one much agitated in the schools; though there were also found some who asserted to the law of Excluded Middle this supreme rank." [From Hamilton LECT. V. LOGIC. 65-66]

=== Three traditional laws: identity, non-contradiction, excluded middle ===

The following will state the three traditional "laws" in the words of Bertrand Russell (1912):

====The law of identity====

The [[law of identity]]: 'Whatever is, is.'&lt;ref name="Russell 1912:72,1997 edition"&gt;Russell 1912:72,1997 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

For all a: a = a.

Regarding this law, Aristotle wrote:
{{quote|First then this at least is obviously true, that the word "be" or "not be" has a definite meaning, so that not everything will be "so and not so". Again, if "man" has one meaning, let this be "two-footed animal"; by having one meaning I understand this:—if "man" means "X", then if A is a man "X" will be what "being a man" means for him. (It makes no difference even if one were to say a word has several meanings, if only they are limited in number; for to each definition there might be assigned a different word. For instance, we might say that "man" has not one meaning but several, one of which would have one definition, viz. "two-footed animal", while there might be also several other definitions if only they were limited in number; for a peculiar name might be assigned to each of the definitions. If, however, they were not limited but one were to say that the word has an infinite number of meanings, obviously reasoning would be impossible; for not to have one meaning is to have no meaning, and if words have no meaning our reasoning with one another, and indeed with ourselves, has been annihilated; for it is impossible to think of anything if we do not think of one thing; but if this is possible, one name might be assigned to this thing.)|Aristotle|[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]], Book IV, Part 4 (translated by W.D. Ross)&lt;ref name="Metaphysics"&gt;http://www.classicallibrary.org/aristotle/metaphysics/book04.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

More than two millennia later, [[George Boole]] alluded to the very same principle as did Aristotle when Boole made the following observation with respect to the nature of [[language]] and those principles that must inhere naturally within them: {{quote|There exist, indeed, certain general principles founded in the very nature of language, by which the use of symbols, which are but the elements of scientific language, is determined. To a certain extent these elements are arbitrary. Their interpretation is purely conventional: we are permitted to employ them in whatever sense we please. But this permission is limited by two indispensable conditions, first, that from the sense once conventionally established we never, in the same process of reasoning, depart; secondly, that the laws by which the process is conducted be founded exclusively upon the above fixed sense or meaning of the symbols employed.|George Boole|[[An Investigation of the Laws of Thought]]}}

====The law of non-contradiction====

The [[law of non-contradiction]] (alternately the 'law of contradiction'&lt;ref name="Russell 1912:72, 1997 edition"&gt;Russell 1912:72, 1997 edition&lt;/ref&gt;): 'Nothing can both be and not be.'&lt;ref name="Russell 1912:72,1997 edition"/&gt;

In other words: "two or more contradictory statements cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time": [[Negation|¬]](A[[Logical conjunction|∧]]¬A).

In the words of Aristotle, that "one cannot say of something that it is and that it is not in the same respect and at the same time". As an illustration of this law, he wrote:
{{quote|It is impossible, then, that "being a man" should mean precisely not being a man, if "man" not only signifies something about one subject but also has one significance ... And it will not be possible to be and not to be the same thing, except in virtue of an ambiguity, just as if one whom we call "man", and others were to call "not-man"; but the point in question is not this, whether the same thing can at the same time be and not be a man in name, but whether it can be in fact.|Aristotle|Metaphysics, Book IV, Part 4 (translated by W.D. Ross)&lt;ref name="Metaphysics" /&gt;}}

====The law of excluded middle====

The law of excluded middle: 'Everything must either be or not be."&lt;ref name="Russell 1912:72,1997 edition"/&gt;

In accordance with the [[law of excluded middle]] or excluded third, for every proposition, either its positive or negative form is true: A[[Logical disjunction|∨]]¬A.

Regarding the [[law of excluded middle]], Aristotle wrote:
{{quote|But on the other hand there cannot be an intermediate between contradictories, but of one subject we must either affirm or deny any one predicate. This is clear, in the first place, if we define what the true and the false are. To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true; so that he who says of anything that it is, or that it is not, will say either what is true or what is false|Aristotle|Metaphysics, Book IV, Part 7 (translated by W.D. Ross)&lt;ref name="Metaphysics" /&gt;}}

===Rationale===
As the quotations from Hamilton above indicate, in particular the "law of identity" entry, the rationale for and expression of the "laws of thought" have been fertile ground for philosophic debate since Plato. Today the debate—about how we "come to know" the world of things and our thoughts—continues; for examples of rationales see the entries, below.
&lt;!--That everything be "the same with itself and different from another" (law of identity) is one of the "self-evident logical principles"&lt;ref&gt;"These three laws are samples of self-evident logical principles, but are not really more fundamental or more self-evident than various other similar principles: for instance, the one we considered just now, which states that what follows from a true premiss is true." ([[Bertrand Russell]], ''[[The Problems of Philosophy]]'', Chapter VII)&lt;/ref&gt; upon which all symbolic communication systems (languages) are founded, for it governs the use of those symbols (names, words, pictograms, etc.) which denote the various individual concepts within a language, so as to eliminate ambiguity in the conveyance of those concepts between the users of the language. Such a principle (law) is necessary because symbolic designators have no inherent meaning of their own, but derive their meaning from the language users themselves, who associate each symbol with an individual concept in a manner that has been conventionally prescribed within their linguistic group. The degree to which this law must be obeyed depends upon the kind of language that one is utilizing. In a [[natural language]] there is considerable tolerance for violations since there are other means—such as the context in which the symbol is used—by which one can determine which of a number of different concepts one is intended to call to mind by the use of a given symbol. However, in the language of [[mathematics]] or [[formal logic]] there is no such tolerance. If, for example, the symbol "+" were allowed to denote both the function of addition and some other mathematical function, then we would be unable to evaluate the truth value of a proposition such as "2+2=4", since the truth of such a proposition would be contingent upon which of the possible functions the symbol "+" was intended to denote. The same is true of symbols such as "2" and "4". If these symbols did not denote conventionally prescribed quantities, then one could not attribute proper meaning to them, and the proposition would be rendered unintelligible.--&gt;
&lt;!-- Furthermore, we cannot think [[Conceptual model|conceptually]] without making use of some form of language (symbolic communication), for thinking conceptually entails the manipulation and amalgamation of simpler [[concept]]s in order to form more complex concepts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Therefore we must have a means of distinguishing these different concepts, namely [[symbol]]s or [[sign]]s. It follows then that the first principle of language (law of identity) is also rightfully called the first principle of thought, and by extension, the first principle of reason (rational thought).{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}{{original research?|date=January 2014}}--&gt;to originally research?|data=february 2019}}--&gt;

==Plato==
In one of Plato's [[Socratic dialogue]]s, [[Socrates]] described three [[principle]]s derived from [[introspection]]: {{Quotation|First, that nothing can become greater or less, either in number or magnitude, while remaining equal to itself ... Secondly, that without addition or subtraction there is no increase or diminution of anything, but only equality ... Thirdly, that what was not before cannot be afterwards, without becoming and having become.|[[Plato]]|[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]], 155&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/plato/p71th/theaetetus.html|title= Theaetetus, by Plato|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= November 10, 2012|publisher= The University of Adelaide Library|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Indian logic==
The [[law of non-contradiction]] is found in ancient [[Indian logic]] as a meta-rule in the ''[[Kalpa (Vedanga)|Shrauta Sutras]]'', the grammar of [[Pāṇini]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Frits Staal]]|title=Universals: Studies in Indian Logic and Linguistics|publisher=[[Chicago]]|year=1988|pages=109–28}} ([[cf.]] {{citation|title=Seeing Things Hidden|first=Malcolm|last=Bull|publisher=Verso|year=1999|isbn=1-85984-263-1|page=53}})&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'' attributed to [[Vyasa]]. It was later elaborated on by medieval commentators such as [[Madhvacharya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A History of Indian Philosophy|first=Surendranath|last=Dasgupta|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|year=1991|isbn=81-208-0415-5|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locke==
[[John Locke]] claimed that the principles of identity and contradiction (i.e. the law of identity and the law of non-contradiction) were general ideas and only occurred to people after considerable abstract, philosophical thought. He characterized the principle of identity as "Whatsoever is, is." He stated the principle of contradiction as "It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be." To Locke, these were not innate or ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/locke.htm|title= An Essay concerning Human Understanding|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leibniz==
[[Gottfried Leibniz]] formulated two additional principles, either or both of which may sometimes be counted as a law of thought:

:* [[principle of sufficient reason]]
:* [[identity of indiscernibles]]

In Leibniz's thought, as well as generally in the approach of [[rationalism]], the latter two principles are regarded as clear and incontestable [[axioms]].  They were widely recognized in [[Europe]]an thought of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, although they were subject to greater debate in the 19th century. As turned out to be the case with the [[law of continuity]], these two laws involve matters which, in contemporary terms, are subject to much debate and analysis (respectively on [[determinism]] and [[extensionality]]{{clarify|date=January 2014}}). Leibniz's principles were particularly influential in German thought. In France, the ''[[Port-Royal Logic]]'' was less swayed by them. [[Hegel]] quarrelled with the [[identity of indiscernibles]] in his ''[[Science of Logic]]'' (1812–1816).

==Schopenhauer==

===Four laws===
"The primary laws of thought, or the conditions of the thinkable, are four: &amp;ndash; 1. The law of identity [A is A]. 2. The law of contradiction. 3. The law of exclusion; or excluded middle. 4. The law of sufficient reason." (Thomas Hughes, ''The Ideal Theory of Berkeley and the Real World'', Part II, Section XV, Footnote, p. [https://archive.org/stream/idealtheoryberk01hughgoog#page/n48/mode/2up 38])

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] discussed the laws of thought and tried to demonstrate that they are the basis of reason. He listed them in the following way in his ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'', §33:

#A subject is equal to the sum of its predicates, or a = a.
#No predicate can be simultaneously attributed and denied to a subject, or a ≠ ~a.
#Of every two contradictorily opposite predicates one must belong to every subject.
#Truth is the reference of a judgment to something outside it as its sufficient reason or ground.
Also:
{{Quotation|The laws of thought can be ''most intelligibly'' expressed thus:
#Everything that is, exists.
#Nothing can simultaneously be and not be.
#Each and every thing either is or is not.
#Of everything that is, it can be found why it is.
There would then have to be added only the fact that once for all in logic the question is about ''what is thought'' and hence about concepts and not about real things.|Schopenhauer| Manuscript Remains'', Vol. 4, "Pandectae II", §163'}}

To show that they are the foundation of [[reason]], he gave the following explanation:
{{Quotation|Through a reflection, which I might call a self-examination of the faculty of reason, we know that these judgments are the expression of the conditions of all thought and therefore have these as their ground. Thus by making vain attempts to think in opposition to these laws, the faculty of reason recognizes them as the conditions of the possibility of all thought. We then find that it is just as impossible to think in opposition to them as it is to move our limbs in a direction contrary to their joints. If the subject could know itself, we should know those laws ''immediately'', and not first through experiments on objects, that is, representations (mental images).|Schopenhauer| ''[[s:On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason#§ 33. Metalogical Truth.|''On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'', §33]]'}}

Schopenhauer's four laws can be schematically presented in the following manner:
#A is A.
#A is not not-A.
#X is either A or not-A.
#If A then B (A implies B).

===Two laws===

Later, in 1844, Schopenhauer claimed that the four laws of thought could be reduced to two. In the ninth chapter of the second volume of ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', he wrote:
{{Quotation|It seems to me that the doctrine of the laws of thought could be simplified if we were to set up only two, the law of excluded middle and that of sufficient reason. The former thus: "Every predicate can be either confirmed or denied of every subject." Here it is already contained in the "either, or" that both cannot occur simultaneously, and consequently just what is expressed by the laws of identity and contradiction. Thus these would be added as corollaries of that principle which really says that every two concept-spheres must be thought either as united or as separated, but never as both at once; and therefore, even although words are joined together which express the latter, these words assert a process of thought which cannot be carried out. The consciousness of this infeasibility is the feeling of contradiction. The second law of thought, the principle of sufficient reason, would affirm that the above attributing or refuting must be determined by something different from the judgment itself, which may be a (pure or empirical) perception, or merely another judgment. This other and different thing is then called the ground or reason of the judgment. So far as a judgement satisfies the first law of thought, it is thinkable; so far as it satisfies the second, it is true, or at least in the case in which the ground of a judgement is only another judgement it is logically or formally true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40097/40097-h/40097-h.html|title= The Project Gutenberg EBook of The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3) by Arthur Schopenhauer|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= June 27, 2012|publisher= Project Gutenberg|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Boole (1854): From his "laws of the mind" Boole derives Aristotle's "Law of contradiction" ==
The title of [[George Boole]]'s 1854 treatise on logic, ''An Investigation on the Laws of Thought'', indicates an alternate path. The laws are now incorporated into an algebraic representation of his "laws of the mind", honed over the years into modern [[Boolean algebra]].

=== Rationale: How the "laws of the mind" are to be distinguished ===
Boole begins his chapter I "Nature and design of this Work" with a discussion of what characteristic distinguishes, generally, "laws of the mind" from "laws of nature":
: "The general laws of Nature are not, for the most part, immediate objects of perception. They are either inductive inferences from a large body of facts, the common truth in which they express, or, in their origin at least, physical hypotheses of a causal nature. . . . They are in all cases, and in the strictest sense of the term, probable conclusions, approaching, indeed, ever and ever nearer to certainty, as they receive more and more of the confirmation of experience. ...”

Contrasted with this are what he calls "laws of the mind": Boole asserts these are known in their first instance, without need of repetition: 
:“On the other hand, the knowledge of the laws of the mind does not require as its basis any extensive collection of observations. The general truth is seen in the particular instance, and it is not confirmed by the repetition of instances. ... we not only see in the particular example the general truth, but we see it also as a certain truth -- a truth, our confidence in which will not continue to increase with increasing experience of its practical verification.” (Boole 1854:4)

=== Boole's signs and their laws ===
Boole begins with the notion of "signs" representing "classes", "operations" and "identity":
:"All the signs of Language, as an instrument of reasoning may be conducted by a system of signs composed of the following elements
::"1st Literal symbols as x, y, etc representing things as subjects of our conceptions,
::"2nd Signs of operation, as +, −, x standing for those operations of the mind by which conceptions of things are combined or resolved so as to form new conceptions involving the same elements,
::"3rd The sign of identity, =.
:And these symbols of Logic are in their use subject to definite laws, partly agreeing with and partly differing from the laws of the corresponding symbols in the science of Algebra. (Boole 1854:27)

Boole then clarifies what a "literal symbol" e.g. x, y, z,... represents—a name applied to a collection of instances into "classes". For example, "bird" represents the entire class of feathered winged warm-blooded creatures. For his purposes he extends the notion of class to represent membership of "one", or "nothing", or "the universe" i.e. totality of all individuals: 
:"Let us then agree to represent the class of individuals to which a particular name or description is applicable, by a single letter, as z. ... By a class is usually meant a collection of individuals, to each of which a particular name or description may be applied; but in this work the meaning of the term will be extended so as to include the case in which but a single individual exists, answering to the required name or description, as well as the cases denoted by the terms "nothing" and "universe," which as "classes" should be understood to comprise respectively 'no beings,' 'all beings.'" (Boole 1854:28)

He then defines what the string of symbols e.g. xy means [modern logical &amp;, conjunction]:
:"Let it further be agreed, that by the combination xy shall be represented that class of things to which the names or descriptions represented by x and y are simultaneously, applicable. Thus, if x alone stands for "white things," and y for "sheep," let xy stand for 'white Sheep;'" (Boole 1854:28)

Given these definitions he now lists his laws with their justification plus examples (derived from Boole):
* (1) xy = yx [commutative law]
:: "x represents 'estuaries,' and y 'rivers,' the expressions xy and yx will indifferently represent" 'rivers that are estuaries,' or 'estuaries that are rivers,'"
* (2) xx = x, alternately x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = x [Absolute identity of meaning, Boole's "fundamental law of thought" cf page 49]
:: "Thus 'good, good" men, is equivalent to 'good' men".
'''Logical OR''': Boole defines the "collecting of parts into a whole or separate a whole into its parts" (Boole 1854:32). Here the connective "and" is used disjunctively, as is "or"; he presents a commutative law (3) and a distributive law (4) for the notion of "collecting". The notion of ''separating'' a part from the whole he symbolizes with the "-" operation; he defines a commutative (5) and distributive law (6) for this notion:
* (3) y + x = x + y [commutative law]
:: "Thus the expression 'men and women' is . . . equivalent with the expression" women and men. Let x represent 'men,' y, 'women' and let + stand for 'and' and 'or' . . ." 
* (4) z(x + y) = zx + zy [distributive law]
:: z = European, (x = "men, y = women): European men and women = European men and European women
* (5) x - y = -y + x [commutation law: separating a part from the whole] 
:: "All men (x) except Asiatics (y)" is represented by x - y. "All states (x) except monarchical states (y)" is represented by x - y
* (6) z(x - y) = zx - zy [distributive law]
Lastly is a notion of "identity" symbolized by "=". This allows for two axioms: (axiom 1): equals added to equals results in equals, (axiom 2): equals subtracted from equals results in equals.
* (7) Identity ("is", "are") e.g. x = y + z, "stars" = "suns" and "the planets"

'''Nothing "0" and Universe "1"''': He observes that the only two numbers that satisfy xx = x are 0 and 1. He then observes that 0 represents "Nothing" while "1" represents the "Universe" (of discourse).

'''The logical NOT''': Boole defines the contrary (logical NOT) as follows (his Proposition III): 
:"If x represent any class of objects, then will 1 - x represent the contrary or supplementary class of objects, i.e. the class including all objects which are not comprehended in the class x" (Boole 1854:48)
::If x = "men" then "1 - x" represents the "universe" less "men", i.e.  "not-men".

'''The notion of a particular as opposed to a universal''': To represent the notion of "some men", Boole writes the small letter "v" before the predicate-symbol "vx" some men.

'''Exclusive- and inclusive-OR''': Boole does not use these modern names, but he defines these as follows x(1-y) + y(1-x) and x + y(1-x), respectively; these agree with the formulas derived by means of the modern Boolean algebra.&lt;ref&gt;cf Boole 1842:55-57. The modern definition of logical OR(x, y) in terms of logical AND &amp;, and logical NOT ~ is: ~(~x &amp; ~y). In Boolean algebra this is represented by: 1-((1-x)*(1-y)) = 1 - (1 - 1*x - y*1 + x*y) = x + y - x*y = x + y*(1-x), which is Boole's expression. The exclusive-OR can be checked in a similar manner.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boole derives the law of contradiction ===
Armed with his "system" he derives the "principle of [non]contradiction" starting with his law of identity: x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = x. He subtracts x from both sides (his axiom 2), yielding x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - x = 0. He then factors out the x: x(x - 1) = 0. For example, if x = "men" then 1 - x represents NOT-men. So we have an example of the "Law of Contradiction":
:"Hence: x(1 - x) will represent the class whose members are at once "men," and" not men," and the equation [x(1 - x)=0] thus express the principle, that a class whose members are at the same time men and not men does not exist. In other words, that it is impossible for the same individual to be at the same time a man and not a man. . . . this is identically that "principle of contradiction" which Aristotle has described as the fundamental axiom of all philosophy. . . . what has been commonly regarded as the fundamental axiom of metaphysics is but the consequence of a law of thought, mathematical in its form." (with more explanation about this "dichotomy" comes about cf Boole 1854:49ff)

=== Boole defines the notion "domain (universe) of discourse"===
This notion is found throughout Boole's "Laws of Thought" e.g. 1854:28, where the symbol "1" (the integer 1) is used to represent "Universe" and "0" to represent "Nothing", and in far more detail later (pages 42ff):
:" Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. . . . Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse."

In his chapter "The Predicate Calculus" Kleene observes that the specification of the "domain" of discourse is "not a trivial assumption, since it is not always clearly satisfied in ordinary discourse . . . in mathematics likewise, logic can become pretty slippery when no D [domain] has been specified explicitly or implicitly, or the specification of a D [domain] is too vague'' (Kleene 1967:84).

==[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]] (1837–38 lectures on Logic, published 1860): a 4th "Law of Reason and Consequent"==
As noted above, Hamilton specifies ''four'' laws—the three traditional plus the fourth "Law of Reason and Consequent"—as follows:
:"XIII. The Fundamental Laws of Thought, or the conditions of the thinkable, as commonly received, are four: -- 1. The Law of Identity; 2. The Law of Contradiction; 3. The Law of Exclusion or of Excluded Middle; and, 4. The Law of Reason and Consequent, or of [[Principle of Sufficient Reason|Sufficient Reason]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]], ([[Henry L. Mansel]] and [[John Veitch (poet)|John Veitch]], ed.), 1860 ''Lectures on Metaphysics and Logic, in Two Volumes. Vol. II. Logic'', Boston: Gould and Lincoln. Hamilton died in 1856, so this is an effort of his editors Mansel and Veitch. Most of the footnotes are additions and emendations by Mansel and Veitch -- see the preface for background information.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationale: "Logic is the science of the Laws of Thought as Thought"===
Hamilton opines that thought comes in two forms: "necessary" and "contingent" (Hamilton 1860:17). With regards the "necessary" form he defines its study as "logic": “Logic is the science of the necessary forms of thought” (Hamilton 1860:17). To define "necessary" he asserts that it implies the following four “qualities”:&lt;ref&gt;Lecture II LOGIC-I. ITS DEFINITION -HISTORICAL NOTICES OF OPINIONS REGARDING ITS OBJECT AND DOMAIN-II. ITS UTILITY Hamilton 1860:17-18&lt;/ref&gt;
:(1) “determined or necessitated by the nature of the thinking subject itself . . . it is subjectively, not objectively, determined;
:(2) “original and not acquired;
:(3) “universal; that is, it cannot be that it necessitates on some occasions, and does not necessitate on others.
:(4) "it must be a law; for a law is that which applies to all cases without exception, and from which a deviation is ever, and everywhere, impossible, or, at least, unallowed.  . . . This last condition, likewise, enables us to give the most explicit enunciation of the object-matter of Logic, in saying that Logic is the science of the Laws of Thought as Thought, or the science of the Formal Laws of Thought, or the science of the Laws of the Form of Thought; for all these are merely various expressions of the same thing."

===Hamilton's 4th law: "Infer nothing without ground or reason"===
Here's Hamilton's fourth law from his LECT. V. LOGIC. 60-61:

:"I now go on to the fourth law.

:"'''Par. XVII. Law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent''':

:"XVII. The thinking of an object, as actually characterized by positive or by negative attributes, is not left to the caprice of Understanding – the faculty of thought; but that faculty must be necessitated to this or that determinate act of thinking by a knowledge of something different from, and independent of; the process of thinking itself. This condition of our understanding is expressed by the law, as it is called, of Sufficient Reason ('''principium Rationis Sufficientis'''); but it is more properly denominated the law of Reason and Consequent ('''principium Rationis et Consecutionis'''). That knowledge by which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit something else, is called the ''logical reason ground,'' or ''antecedent''; that something else which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit, is called the ''logical consequent''; and the relation between the reason and consequent, is called the ''logical connection or consequence''. This law is expressed in the formula - Infer nothing without a ground or reason.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

:'''Relations between Reason and Consequent''': The relations between Reason and Consequent, when comprehended in a pure thought, are the following:
:1. When a reason is explicitly or implicitly given, then there must ¶ exist a consequent; and, ''vice versa'', when a consequent is given, there must also exist a reason.

::&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; See Schulze, ''Logik'', §19, and Krug, ''Logik'', §20, - ED.

:2. Where there is no reason there can be no consequent; and, ''vice versa'', where there is no consequent (either implicitly or explicitly) there can be no reason. That is, the concepts of reason and of consequent, as reciprocally relative, involve and suppose each other.

:'''The logical significance of this law''': The logical significance of the law of Reason and Consequent lies in this, - That in virtue of it, thought is constituted into a series of acts all indissolubly connected; each necessarily inferring the other. Thus it is that the distinction and opposition of possible, actual and necessary matter, which has been introduced into Logic, is a doctrine wholly extraneous to this science.

==Welton==
In the 19th century, the Aristotelian laws of thoughts, as well as sometimes the Leibnizian laws of thought, were standard material in logic textbooks, and J. Welton described them in this way:
{{Quotation|The Laws of Thought, Regulative Principles of Thought, or Postulates of Knowledge, are those fundamental, necessary, formal and a priori mental laws in agreement with which all valid thought must be carried on. They are a priori, that is, they result directly from the processes of reason exercised upon the facts of the real world. They are formal; for as the necessary laws of all thinking, they cannot, at the same time, ascertain the definite properties of any particular class of things, for it is optional whether we think of that class of things or not. They are necessary, for no one ever does, or can, conceive them reversed, or really violate them, because no one ever accepts a contradiction which presents itself to his mind as such.|Welton, ''A Manual of Logic'', 1891, Vol. I, p. 30.}}

==Russell (1903–1927)==
The sequel to [[Bertrand Russell]]'s 1903 "The Principles of Mathematics" became the three volume work named [[Principia Mathematica]] (hereafter PM), written jointly with [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. Immediately after he and Whitehead published PM he wrote his 1912 "The Problems of Philosophy". His "Problems" reflects "the central ideas of Russell's logic".&lt;ref&gt;Commentary by John Perry in Russell 1912, 1997 edition page ix&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Principles of Mathematics (1903)===
In his 1903 "Principles" Russell defines Symbolic or Formal Logic (he uses the terms synonymously) as "the study of the various general types of deduction" (Russell 1903:11). He asserts that "Symbolic Logic is essentially concerned with inference in general" (Russell 1903:12) and with a footnote indicates that he does not distinguish between inference and [[deductive reasoning|deduction]]; moreover he considers [[inductive reasoning|induction]] "to be either disguised deduction or a mere method of making plausible guesses" (Russell 1903:11). This opinion will change by 1912, when he deems his "principle of induction" to be par with the various "logical principles" that include the "Laws of Thought".

In his Part I "The Indefinables of Mathematics" Chapter II "Symbolic Logic" Part A "The Propositional Calculus" Russell reduces deduction ("propositional calculus") to 2 "indefinables" and 10 axioms:
:"17. We require, then, in the propositional calculus, no indefinable except the two kinds of implication [simple aka  "material"&lt;ref&gt;The "simple" type of implication, aka material implication, is the logical connective commonly symbolized by → or ⊃, e.g. p ⊃ q. As a connective it yields the truth value of "falsity" only when the truth value of statement p is "truth" when the truth value of statement q is "falsity"; in 1903 Russell is claiming that "A definition of implication is quite impossible" (Russell 1903:14). He will overcome this problem in PM with the simple definition of (p ⊃ q) =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt; (NOT-p OR q).&lt;/ref&gt; and "formal"]-- remembering, however, that formal implication is a complex notion, whose analysis remains to be undertaken. As regards our two indefinables, we require certain indemonstrable propositions, which hitherto I have not succeeded in reducing to less ten (Russell 1903:15).

From these he ''claims'' to be able to ''derive'' the '''law of excluded middle''' and the '''law of contradiction''' but does not exhibit his derivations (Russell 1903:17). Subsequently, he and Whitehead honed these "primitive principles" and axioms into the nine found in PM, and here Russell actually ''exhibits'' these two derivations at ❋1.71 and ❋3.24, respectively.

===''The Problems of Philosophy'' (1912)===
By 1912 Russell in his "Problems" pays close attention to "induction" (inductive reasoning) as well as "deduction" (inference), both of which represent just two ''examples'' of "self-evident logical principles" that include the "Laws of Thought."&lt;ref name="Russell 1912:72, 1997 edition"/&gt;

'''Induction principle''': Russell devotes a chapter to his "induction principle". He describes it as coming in two parts: firstly, as a repeated collection of evidence (with no failures of association known) and therefore increasing probability that whenever A happens B follows; secondly, in a fresh instance when indeed A happens, B will indeed follow: i.e. "a sufficient number of cases of association will make the probability of a fresh association nearly a certainty, and will make it approach certainty without limit."&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1912:66, 1997 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

He then collects all the cases (instances) of the induction principle (e.g. case 1: A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = "the rising sun", B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = "the eastern sky"; case 2: A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = "the setting sun", B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = "the western sky"; case 3: etc.) into a "general" law of induction which he expresses as follows:
:"(a) The greater the number of cases in which a thing of the sort A has been found associated with a thing of the sort B, the more probable it is (if cases of failure of association are known) that A is always associated with B;
:"(b) Under the same circumstances, a sufficient number of cases of the association of A with B will make it nearly certain that A is always associated with B, and will make this general law approach certainty without limit."&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1912:67, 1997 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

He makes an argument that this induction principle can neither be disproved or proved by experience,&lt;ref&gt;name="Russell 1912:70, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; the failure of disproof occurring because the law deals with ''probability'' of success rather than certainty; the failure of proof occurring because of unexamined cases that are yet to be experienced, i.e. they will occur (or not) in the future. "Thus we must either accept the inductive principle on the ground of its intrinsic evidence, or forgo all justification of our expectations about the future".&lt;ref&gt;name="Russell 1912:69, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In his next chapter ("On Our Knowledge of General Principles") Russell offers other principles that have this similar property: "which cannot be proved or disproved by experience, but are used in arguments which start from what is experienced." He asserts that these "have even greater evidence than the principle of induction . . . the knowledge of them has the same degree of certainty as the knowledge of the existence of sense-data. They constitute the means of drawing inferences from what is given in sensation".&lt;ref name="Russell 1912:70, 1997 edition"&gt;Russell 1912:70, 1997 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inference principle''': Russell then offers an example that he calls a "logical" principle. Twice previously he has asserted this principle, first as the 4th axiom in his 1903&lt;ref&gt;(4) A true hypothesis in an implication may be dropped, and the consequent asserted. This is a principle incapable of formal symbolic statement . . ." (Russell 1903:16)&lt;/ref&gt; and then as his first "primitive proposition" of PM: "❋1.1 Anything implied by a true elementary proposition is true".&lt;ref&gt;Principia Mathematica 1962 edition:94&lt;/ref&gt; Now he repeats it in his 1912 in a refined form: "Thus our principle states that if this implies that, and this is true, then that is true. In other words, 'anything implied by a true proposition is true', or 'whatever follows from a true proposition is true'.&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1912:71, 1997 edition&lt;/ref&gt; This principle he places great stress upon, stating that "this principle is really involved -- at least, concrete instances of it are involved -- in all demonstrations".&lt;ref name="Russell 1912:72, 1997 edition"/&gt;

He does not call his inference principle ''[[modus ponens]]'', but his formal, symbolic expression of it in PM (2nd edition 1927) is that of ''modus ponens''; modern logic calls this a "rule" as opposed to a "law".&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Alfred Tarski]] (Tarski 1946:47) distinguishes ''modus ponens'' as one of three "''rules'' of inference" or "''rules'' of proof", and he asserts that these "must not be mistaken for logical laws". The two other such "rules" are that of "definition" and "substitution"; see the entry under '''Tarski'''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the quotation that follows, the symbol "⊦" is the "assertion-sign" (cf PM:92); “⊦" means "it is true that", therefore “⊦p” where "p" is "the sun is rising" means "it is true that the sun is rising", alternately "The statement 'The sun is rising' is true". The "implication" symbol "⊃" is commonly read "if p then q", or "p implies q" (cf PM:7). Embedded in this notion of "implication" are two "primitive ideas", "the Contradictory Function" (symbolized by NOT, "~") and "the Logical Sum or Disjunction" (symbolized by OR, "⋁"); these appear as "primitive propositions" ❋1.7 and ❋1.71 in PM (PM:97). With these two "primitive propositions" Russell defines "p ⊃ q" to have the formal logical equivalence "NOT-p OR q" symbolized by "~p ⋁ q":
:"''Inference''. The process of inference is as follows: a proposition "p" is asserted, and a proposition "p implies q" is asserted, and then as a sequel the proposition "q" is asserted. The trust in inference is the belief that if the two former assertions are not in error, the final assertion is not in error. Accordingly, whenever, in symbols, where p and q have of course special determination
::" “⊦p” and “⊦(p ⊃ q)”
:" have occurred, then “⊦q” will occur if it is desired to put it on record. The process of the inference cannot be reduced to symbols. Its sole record is the occurrence of “⊦q”. . . . An inference is the dropping of a true premiss; it is the dissolution of an implication".&lt;ref&gt;Principia Mathematica 2nd edition (1927), pages 8 and 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, in a long "string" of inferences, after each inference we can '''detach''' the "consequent" “⊦q” from the symbol string “⊦p, ⊦(p⊃q)” and not carry these symbols forward in an ever-lengthening string of symbols. 
   
'''The three traditional "laws" (principles) of thought''': Russell goes on to assert other principles, of which the above logical principle is "only one". He asserts that "some of these must be granted before any argument or proof becomes possible. When some of them have been granted, others can be proved." Of these various "laws" he asserts that "for no very good reason, three of these principles have been singled out by tradition under the name of 'Laws of Thought'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Russell 1912:72, 1997 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; And these he lists as follows:
   
: "(1) ''The law of identity'': 'Whatever is, is.'
   
: (2) ''The law of contradiction'': 'Nothing can both be and not be.'
   
: (3) ''The law of excluded middle'': 'Everything must either be or not be.'"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Rationale''': Russell opines that "the name 'laws of thought' is ... misleading, for what is important is not the fact that we think in accordance with these laws, but the fact that things behave in accordance with them; in other words, the fact that when we think in accordance with them we think ''truly''."&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1997:73 reprint of Russell 1912&lt;/ref&gt; But he rates this a "large question" and expands it in two following chapters where he begins with an investigation of the notion of "a priori" (innate, built-in) knowledge, and ultimately arrives at his acceptance of the Platonic "world of universals". In his investigation he comes back now and then to the three traditional laws of thought, singling out the law of contradiction in particular: "The conclusion that the law of contradiction is a law of ''thought'' is nevertheless erroneous . . . [rather], the law of contradiction is about things, and not merely about thoughts . . . a fact concerning the things in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1997:88-89 reprint of Russell 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

His argument begins with the statement that the three traditional laws of thought are "samples of self-evident principles". For Russell the matter of "self-evident"&lt;ref&gt;Russell asserts they are "self-evident" a couple times, at Russell 1912, 1967:72&lt;/ref&gt; merely introduces the larger question of how we derive our knowledge of the world. He cites the "historic controversy . . . between the two schools called respectively 'empiricists' [ [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[David Hume|Hume]] ] and 'rationalists' [ [[Rene Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]]" (these philosophers are his examples).&lt;ref name="Russell 1912, 1967:73"&gt;Russell 1912, 1967:73&lt;/ref&gt; Russell asserts that the rationalists "maintained that, in addition to what we know by experience, there are certain 'innate ideas' and 'innate principles', which we know independently of experience";&lt;ref name="Russell 1912, 1967:73"/&gt; to eliminate the possibility of babies having innate knowledge of the "laws of thought", Russell renames this sort of knowledge ''a priori''. And while Russell agrees with the empiricists that "Nothing can be known to ''exist'' except by the help of experience,",&lt;ref&gt;"That is to say, if we wish to prove that something of which we have no direct experience exists, we must have among our premises the existence of one or more things of which we have direct experience"; Russell 1912, 1967:75&lt;/ref&gt; he also agrees with the rationalists that some knowledge is ''a priori'', specifically "the propositions of logic and pure mathematics, as well as the fundamental propositions of ethics".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1912, 1967:80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

This question of how such ''a priori'' knowledge can exist directs Russell to an investigation into the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], which after careful consideration he rejects as follows:
:". . . there is one main objection which seems fatal to any attempt to deal with the problem of ''a priori'' knowledge by his method. The thing to be accounted for is our certainty that the facts must always conform to logic and arithmetic. . . . Thus Kant's solution unduly limits the scope of ''a priori'' propositions, in addition to failing in the attempt at explaining their certainty''".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1912, 1967:87,88&lt;/ref&gt;

His objections to Kant then leads Russell to accept the 'theory of ideas' of [[Plato]], "in my opinion . . . one of the most successful attempts hitherto made.";&lt;ref name="Russell 1912, 1967:93"&gt;Russell 1912, 1967:93&lt;/ref&gt; he asserts that " . . . we must examine our knowledge of universals . . . where we shall find that [this consideration] solves the problem of ''a priori'' knowledge.".&lt;ref name="Russell 1912, 1967:93"/&gt;

=== Principia Mathematica ( Part I: 1910 first edition, 1927 2nd edition) ===
Unfortunately, Russell's "Problems" does not offer an example of a "minimum set" of principles that would apply to human reasoning, both inductive and deductive. But PM does at least provide ''an'' example set (but not the minimum; see '''Post''' below) that is sufficient for ''deductive'' reasoning by means of the [[propositional calculus]] (as opposed to reasoning by means of the more-complicated [[predicate calculus]])—a total of 8 principles at the start of "Part I: Mathematical Logic". Each of the formulas :❋1.2 to :❋1.6 is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] (true no matter what the truth-value of p, q, r ... is). What is missing in PM's treatment is a formal rule of substitution;&lt;ref&gt;In his 1944 ''Russell's mathematical logic'', [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] observes that "What is missing, above all, is a precise statement of the syntax of the formalism. Syntactical considerations are omitted even in cases where they are necessary for the cogency of the proofs . . . The matter is especially doubtful for the rule of substitution and of replacing defined symbols by their ''definiens'' . . . it is chiefly the rule of substitution which would have to be proved" (Gödel 1944:124)&lt;/ref&gt; in his 1921 PhD thesis [[Emil Post]] fixes this deficiency (see '''Post''' below). In what follows the formulas are written in a more modern format than that used in PM; the names are given in PM). 
:❋1.1 Anything implied by a true elementary proposition is true.
:❋1.2 Principle of Tautology: (p ⋁ p) ⊃ p
:❋1.3 Principle of [logical] Addition: q ⊃ (p ⋁ q)
:❋1.4 Principle of Permutation: (p ⋁ q) ⊃ (q ⋁ p)
:❋1.5 Associative Principle: p ⋁ (q ⋁ r) ⊃ q ⋁ (p ⋁ r) [''redundant'']
:❋1.6 Principle of [logical] Summation: (q ⊃ r) ⊃ ((p ⋁ q) ⊃ (p ⋁ r))
:❋1.7 [logical NOT]: If p is an elementary proposition, ~p is an elementary proposition.
:❋1.71 [logical inclusive OR]: If p and q are elementary propositions, (p ⋁ q) is an elementary proposition.
Russell sums up these principles with "This completes the list of primitive propositions required for the theory of deduction as applied to elementary propositions" (PM:97).

Starting from these eight tautologies and a tacit use of the "rule" of substitution, PM then derives over a hundred different formulas, among which are the '''Law of Excluded Middle ❋1.71''', and the '''Law of Contradiction ❋3.24''' (this latter requiring a definition of logical AND symbolized by the modern ⋀: (p ⋀ q) =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt; ~(~p ⋁ ~q). (PM uses the "dot" symbol &lt;sub&gt;▪&lt;/sub&gt; for logical AND)).

==Ladd-Franklin (1914): "principle of exclusion" and the "principle of exhaustion"==
At about the same time (1912) that Russell and Whitehead were finishing the last volume of their Principia Mathematica, and the publishing of Russell's "The Problems of Philosophy" at least two logicians ([[Louis Couturat]], [[Christine Ladd-Franklin]]) were asserting that two "laws" (principles) of contradiction" and "excluded middle" are necessary to specify "contradictories"; Ladd-Franklin renamed these the principles of [[Mutually exclusive events|exclusion]] and [[Collectively exhaustive events|exhaustion]]. The following appears as a footnote on page 23 of Couturat 1914:
:"As Mrs. LADD·FRANKLlN has truly remarked (BALDWIN, Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, article "Laws of Thought"), the principle of contradiction is not sufficient to define contradictories; the principle of excluded middle must be added which equally deserves the name of principle of contradiction. This is why Mrs. LADD-FRANKLIN proposes to call them respectively the principle of exclusion and the principle of exhaustion, inasmuch as, according to the first, two contradictory terms are exclusive (the one of the other); and, according to the second, they are exhaustive (of the universe of discourse)."

In other words, the creation of "contradictories" represents a [[dichotomy]], i.e. the "splitting" of a [[universe of discourse]] into two classes (collections) that have the following two properties: they are (i) mutually exclusive and (ii) (collectively) exhaustive.&lt;ref&gt;Cf Nagel and Newman 1958:110; in their treatment they apply this dichotomy to the collection of "sentences" (formulas) generated by a logical system such as that used by [[Kurt Gödel]] in his paper "On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematical and Related Systems". They call the two classes K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and define logical contradiction ~S as follows: "A formula having the form ~S is placed in [class] K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, if S is in K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; otherwise, it is placed in K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, no one thing (drawn from the universe of discourse) can simultaneously be a member of both classes (law of non-contradiction), ''but'' [and] every single thing (in the universe of discourse) must be a member of one class or the other (law of excluded middle).

==Post (1921): The propositional calculus is consistent and complete==
As part of his PhD thesis "Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions" [[Emil Post]] proved "the system of elementary propositions of Principia [PM]" i.e. its "propositional calculus"&lt;ref&gt;In the introductory comments to Post 1921 written by van Heijenoort page 264, van H observes that "The propositional calculus, carved out of the system of ''Principia Mathematica'', is systematically studied in itself, as a well-defined fragment of logic".&lt;/ref&gt; described by PM's first 8 "primitive propositions" to be ''consistent''. The definition of "consistent" is this: that by means of the deductive "system" at hand (its stated axioms, laws, rules) it is impossible to derive (display) both a formula S and its contradictory ~S (i.e. its logical negation) (Nagel and Newman 1958:50). To demonstrate this formally, Post had to add a primitive proposition to the 8 primitive propositions of PM, a "rule" that specified the notion of "substitution" that was missing in the original PM of 1910.&lt;ref&gt;In a footnote he stated "This operation is not explicitly stated in ''Principia'' but is pointed out to be necessary by Russell (1919, p. 151). Indeed: "The legitimacy of substitutions of this kind has to be insured by means of a non-formal principle of inference.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This footnote 1 states: "&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; No such principle is enunciated in Principia Mathematica or in M. Nicod's article mentioned above. But this would seem to be an omission". cf Russell 1919:151 referenced by Post 1921 in van Heijenoort 1967:267)&lt;/ref&gt;

Given PM's tiny set of "primitive propositions" and the proof of their consistency, Post then proves that this system ("propositional calculus" of PM) is ''complete'', meaning every possible [[truth table]] can be generated in the "system":
:". . .every truth system has a representation in the system of Principia while every complete system, that is one having all possible truth tables, is equivalent to it. . . . We thus see that complete systems are equivalent to the system of ''Principia'' not only in the truth table development but also postulationally. As other systems are in a sense degenerate forms of complete systems we can conclude that no new logical systems are introduced."&lt;ref&gt;Post 1921 in van Heijenoort 1967:267)&lt;/ref&gt;

===A minimum set of axioms? The matter of their independence===
Then there is the matter of "independence" of the axioms. In his commentary before Post 1921, [[Jean van Heijenoort|van Heijenoort]] states that [[Paul Bernays]] solved the matter in 1918 (but published in 1926) -- the formula ❋1.5 Associative Principle: p ⋁ (q ⋁ r) ⊃ q ⋁ (p ⋁ r) can be proved with the other four. As to what system of "primitive-propositions" is the minimum, van Heijenoort states that the matter was "investigated by Zylinski (1925), Post himself (1941), and Wernick (1942)" but van Heijenoort does not answer the question.&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary before Post 1921 in van Heijenoort:264-265&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Model theory versus proof theory: Post's proof ===
Kleene (1967:33) observes that "logic" can be "founded" in two ways, first as a "model theory", or second by a formal "proof" or "axiomatic theory"; "the two formulations, that of model theory and that of proof theory, give equivalent results"(Kleene 1967:33). This foundational choice, and their equivalence also applies to ''predicate logic'' (Kleene 1967:318). 
 
In his introduction to Post 1921, van Heijenoort observes that both the "truth-table and the axiomatic approaches are clearly presented".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort:264&lt;/ref&gt; This matter of a proof of consistency both ways (by a model theory, by axiomatic proof theory) comes up in the more-congenial version of Post's consistency proof that can be found in Nagel and Newman 1958 in their chapter V "An Example of a Successful Absolute Proof of Consistency". In the main body of the text they use a model to achieve their consistency proof (they also state that the system is complete but do not offer a proof) (Nagel &amp; Newman 1958:45-56). But their text promises the reader a proof that is axiomatic rather than relying on a model, and in the Appendix they deliver this proof based on the notions of a division of formulas into two classes K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that are '''mutually exclusive''' and '''exhaustive''' (Nagel &amp; Newman 1958:109-113)
&lt;!-- Their proofs adopt the same four axioms as those of Post 1921, minus the axiom ❋1.5 shown to be redundant by Bernays 1926. 
* First they specify the symbols called "variables" (e.g. p, q, r . . .), 
* Second, they assert the symbols they call "sentential connectives":  "~" (NOT), "⋁" (OR), "⊃" (IF . . . THEN . . .), and "▪" (AND), and two "signs of punctuation" "(", and ")". 
* Third they specify the ''Formation Rules'' that specify how to construct "valid" formulas from the variable-, connective- and punctuation-symbol : If S is a formula then ~(S) is a formula, If S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are formulas then (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⋁ S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊃ S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ▪ S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)is a formula.  
* Fourth are the two "transformation rules", the now-familiar Rules of Substitution and Detachment (''modus ponens''). 
Given this "system" they then propose to prove the "system" consistent. "The actual procedure is elegant", they state. "It consists in finding a characteristic or structural property of formulas [i.e. the 4 axioms and all "valid" logical formulas derived from them via the transformation rules] which satisfies the three following conditions". The property must be (1) common to all four axioms, AND (2) "hereditary" under the Transformation Rules (i.e. every axiom, and every formula derived by means of the ''Transformation'' rules from the axioms must have this property), BUT (3) at least one formula derived by the ''Formation'' rules does not have this property.

The property they pick is "tautologous", meaning the formula's truth value ''always'' evaluates to "true". They exhibit (p ⋁ q) as a properly-formed formula, but one that is not tautologus -- if p's truth value is "falsity" and q's truth value is "falsity" then (p ⋁ q)truth value is "falsity". They offer proof of the inheritability of "tautolgous" in appendices.--&gt;

==Gödel (1930): The first-order predicate calculus is complete==
The (restricted) "first-order predicate calculus" is the "system of logic" that adds to the propositional logic (cf '''Post''', above) the notion of "subject-predicate" i.e. the subject x is drawn from a domain (universe) of discourse and the predicate is a logical function f(x): x as subject and f(x) as predicate (Kleene 1967:74). Although Gödel's proof involves the same notion of "completeness" as does the proof of Post, Gödel's proof is far more difficult; what follows is a discussion of the axiom set.

=== Completeness ===
[[Kurt Gödel]] in his 1930 doctoral dissertation "The completeness of the axioms of the functional calculus of logic" proved that in this "calculus" (i.e. restricted predicate logic with or without equality) that every valid formula is "either refutable or satisfiable"&lt;ref&gt;cf introduction to Gödel 1930 by van Heijenoort 1967:582&lt;/ref&gt; or what amounts to the same thing: every valid formula is provable and therefore the logic is complete. Here is Gödel's definition of whether or not the "restricted functional calculus" is "complete":
:". . . whether it actually suffices for the derivation of ''every'' logico-mathematical proposition, or where, perhaps, it is conceivable that there are true propositions (which may be provable by means of other principles) that cannot be derived in the system under consideration."&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1930 in van Heijenoort 1967:582&lt;/ref&gt;

===The first-order predicate calculus===
This particular predicate calculus is "restricted to the first order". To the propositional calculus it adds two special symbols that symbolize the generalizations "for all" and "there exists (at least one)" that extend over the domain of discourse. The calculus requires only the first notion "for all", but typically includes both: (1) the notion "for all x" or "for every x" is symbolized in the literature as variously as (x), ∀x, ∏x etc., and the (2) notion of "there exists (at least one x)" variously symbolized as Ex, ∃x.

The '''restriction''' is that the generalization "for all" applies only to the ''variables'' (objects x, y, z etc. drawn from the domain of discourse) and not to functions, in other words the calculus will permit ∀xf(x) ("for all creatures x, x is a bird") but not ∀f∀x(f(x)) [but if "equality" is added to the calculus it will permit ∀f:f(x); see below under '''Tarski'''].  Example:
: Let the predicate "function" f(x) be "x is a mammal", and the subject-domain (or [[universe of discourse]]) (cf Kleene 1967:84) be the category "bats":
: The formula ∀xf(x) yields the truth value "truth" (read: "For all instances x of objects 'bats', 'x is a mammal'" is a truth, i.e. "All bats are mammals"); 
: But if the instances of x are drawn from a domain "winged creatures" then ∀xf(x) yields the truth value "false" (i.e. "For all instances x of 'winged creatures', 'x is a mammal'" has a truth value of "falsity"; "Flying insects are mammals" is false);
: However over the broad domain of discourse "all winged creatures" (e.g. "birds" + "flying insects" + "flying squirrels" + "bats") we ''can'' assert ∃xf(x) (read: "There exists at least one winged creature that is a mammal'"; it yields a truth value of "truth" because the objects x can come from the category "bats" and perhaps "flying squirrels" (depending on how we define "winged"). But the formula yields "falsity" when the domain of discourse is restricted to "flying insects" or "birds" or both "binsects" and "birds".

Kleene remarks that "the predicate calculus (without or with equality) fully accomplishes (for first order theories) what has been conceived to be the role of logic" (Kleene 1967:322).

===A new axiom: Aristotle's dictum – "the maxim of all and none" ===
This first half of this axiom -- "the maxim of all" will appear as the first of two additional axioms in Gödel's axiom set. The "dictum of Aristotle" ([[dictum de omni et nullo]]) is sometimes called "the maxim of all and none" but is really two "maxims" that assert: "What is true of all (members of the domain) is true of some (members of the domain)", and "What is not true of all (members of the domain) is true of none (of the members of the domain)".

The "dictum" appears in Boole 1854 a couple places:
:"It may be a question whether that formula of reasoning, which is called the dictum of Aristotle, ''de Omni et nullo'', expresses a primary law of human reasoning or not; but it is no question that it expresses a general truth in Logic" (1854:4)

But later he seems to argue against it:&lt;ref&gt;cf Boole 1854:226 ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC. CHAPTER XV. [CHAP. XV. THE ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC AND ITS MODERN EXTENSIONS, EXAMINED BY THE METHOD OF THIS TREATISE&lt;/ref&gt;
:"[Some principles of] general principle of an axiomatic nature, such as the "dictum of Aristotle:" Whatsoever is affirmed or denied of the genus may in the same sense be affirmed or denied of any species included under that genus. . . . either state directly, but in an abstract form, the argument which they are supposed to elucidate, and, so stating that argument, affirm its validity; or involve in their expression technical terms which, after definition, conduct us again to the same point, viz. the abstract statement of the supposed allowable forms of inference."

But the first half of this "dictum" (''dictum de omni'') is taken up by Russell and Whitehead in PM, and by [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] in his version (1927) of the "first order predicate logic"; his (system) includes a principle that Hilbert calls "Aristotle's dictum" &lt;ref&gt;He derives this and a "principle of the excluded middle" ~((x)f(x))→(Ex)~f(x) from his "ε-axiom" cf Hilbert 1927 "The Foundations of Mathematics", cf van Heijenoort 1967:466&lt;/ref&gt; 
:(x)f(x) → f(y)

This axiom also appears in the modern axiom set offered by [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] (Kleene 1967:387), as his "∀-schema", one of two axioms (he calls them "postulates") required for the predicate calculus; the other being the "∃-schema" f(y) ⊃ ∃xf(x) that reasons from the particular f(y) to the existence of at least one subject x that satisfies the predicate f(x); both of these requires adherence to a defined domain (universe) of discourse.

=== Gödel's restricted predicate calculus ===
To supplement the four (down from five; see '''Post''') axioms of the propositional calculus, Gödel 1930 adds the ''dictum de omni'' as the first of two additional axioms. Both this "dictum" and the second axiom, he claims in a footnote, derive from ''Principia Mathematica''. Indeed, PM includes both as
:❋10.1 ⊦ ∀xf(x) ⊃ f(y) ["I.e. what is true in all cases is true in any one case"&lt;ref&gt;1962 edition of PM 2nd edition 1927:139&lt;/ref&gt; ("Aristotle's dictum", rewritten in more-modern symbols)]
:❋10.2 ⊦∀x(p ⋁ f(x)) ⊃ (p ⋁ ∀xf(x)) [rewritten in more-modern symbols]
The latter asserts that the logical sum (i.e. ⋁, OR) of a simple proposition p and a predicate ∀xf(x) implies the logical sum of each separately. But PM derives both of these from six primitive propositions of ❋9, which in the second edition of PM is discarded and replaced with four new "Pp" (primitive principles) of ❋8 (see in particular ❋8.2, and Hilbert derives the first from his "logical ε-axiom" in his 1927 and does not mention the second. How Hilbert and Gödel came to adopt these two as axioms is unclear.

Also required are two more "rules" of detachment ("modus ponens") applicable to predicates.

==Tarski (1946): Leibniz's Law==
[[Alfred Tarski]] in his 1946 (2nd edition) "Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of the Deductive Sciences" cites a number of what he deems "universal laws" of the sentential calculus,  three "rules" of inference, and one fundamental law of identity (from which he derives four more laws). The traditional "laws of thought" are included in his long listing of "laws" and "rules". His treatment is, as the title of his book suggests, limited to the "Methodology of the Deductive Sciences".

'''Rationale''': In his introduction (2nd edition) he observes that what began with an application of logic to mathematics has been widened to "the whole of human knowledge": 
:"[I want to present] a clear idea of that powerful trend of contemporary thought which is concentrated about modern logic. This trend arose originally from the somewhat limited task of stabilizing the foundations of mathematics. In its present phase, however, it has much wider aims. For it seeks to create a unified conceptual apparatus which would supply a common basis for the whole of human knowledge.".&lt;ref&gt;Tarski 1946:ix, 1995 edition&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- '''Laws of the sentential calculus''': Tarski defines a "law" as follows (cf p.&amp;nbsp;37ff):
:"Every scientific theory is a system of sentences which are accepted as true and which may be called LAWS or ASSERTED STATEMENTS, or, for short, simply STATEMENTS".&lt;ref&gt;Tarski 1946:3, 1995 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

(After the first "law", for brevity he omits the universal qualifier "For any p, q , . . ."). The symbol "~" indicates logical NOT, the symbol ⋀ indicates logical AND, the symbol ⋁ indicates logical OR, the symbol ↔ indicates logical equivalence ("if and only if"). He uses "matrices" (truth tables) to define these symbols; truth tables can then be used to demonstrate that each of these "laws" is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] (true no matter what truth value is assigned to each "variable" p, q, r): 
*Law of Simplification for logical multiplication [logical AND]: For any p and q: (p ⋀ q) → p
*'''Law of Identity: p → p'''.
*Law of Simplification for logical addition [logical OR]: p → (q ⋁ p)
*Law of [? logical equivalence]: [(p → q) ⋀ (q → p)] →  p ↔ q.
*Law of the Hypothetical Syllogism: [(p → q) ⋀ (q → r)] → (p → r).
*'''Law of Contradiction: ~[p ⋀ (~p)]'''
*'''Law of Excluded Middle: p ⋁ (~p)'''
*Law of Tautology for logical multiplication [logical AND]: (p ⋀ p) ↔ p
*Law of Tautology for logical addition [logical OR]: (p ⋁ p) ↔ p
*Law of Commutation [for logical AND]: (p ⋀ q) ↔ (q ⋀ p)
*Law of Commutation [for logical OR]: (p ⋁ q) ↔ (q ⋁ p)
*Law of Association [for logical AND]: (p ⋀ (q ⋀ r) ↔ [(p ⋀ q) ⋀ r]
*Law of Association [for logical OR]: (p ⋁ (q ⋁ r) ↔ [(p ⋁ q) ⋁ r]

'''Rules of inference''': Tarski then defines what he calls three "rules of inference" ("rules of proof") with this definition of what a "rule" is as opposed to a "law":
:"These rules, which must not be mistaken for logical laws, amount to directions as to how sentences already known as true may be transformed so as to yield new true sentences".&lt;ref&gt;Tarski 1946:47, 1995 edition&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rule of Definition
*Rule of [[Substitution]]
*Rule of Detachment ("[[modus ponens]] rule") ---&gt;

===Law of identity (Leibniz's Law, equality)===
To add the notion of "equality" to the "propositional calculus" (this new notion not to be confused with ''logical'' equivalence symbolized by ↔, ⇄, "if and only if (iff)", "biconditional", etc.) Tarski (cf p54-57) symbolizes what he calls  "Leibniz's law" with the symbol "=". This extends the domain (universe) of discourse and the types of functions to numbers and mathematical formulas (Kleene 1967:148ff, Tarski 1946:54ff).

In a nutshell: given that "x has every property that y has", we can write "x = y", and this formula will have a truth value of "truth" or "falsity". Tarski states this Leibniz's Law as follows:
* I. Leibniz' Law: x = y, if, and only if, x has every property which y has, and y has every property which x has.
He then derives some other "laws" from this law: 
* II. Law of Reflexivity: Everything is equal to itself: x = x. [Proven at PM ❋13.15]
* III. Law of Symmetry: If x = y, then y = x. [Proven at PM ❋13.16]
* IV. Law of Transitivity: If x = y and y = z, then x = z. [Proven at PM ❋13.17]
* V. If x = z and y = z, then x = y. [Proven at PM ❋13.172]

Principia Mathematica ''defines'' the notion of equality as follows (in modern symbols); note that the generalization "for all" extends over predicate-functions f( ):
:❋13.01. x = y =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt; ∀f:(f(x) → f(y)) ("This definition states that x and y are to be called identical when every predicate function satisfied by x is satisfied by y"&lt;ref&gt;cf PM ❋13 IDENTITY, "Summary of ❋13" PM 1927 edition 1962:168&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilbert 1927:467 adds only two axioms of equality, the first is x = x, the second is (x = y) → ((f(x) → f(y)); the "for all f" is missing (or implied). Gödel 1930 defines equality similarly to PM :❋13.01. Kleene 1967 adopts the two from Hilbert 1927 plus two more (Kleene 1967:387).

== Contemporary developments ==
All of the above "systems of logic" are considered to be "classical" meaning propositions and predicate expressions are two-valued, with either the truth value "truth" or "falsity" but not both(Kleene 1967:8 and 83). While intuitionistic logic falls into the "classical" category, it objects to extending the "for all" operator to the Law of Excluded Middle; it allows instances of the "Law", but not its generalization to an infinite domain of discourse.

=== Intuitionistic logic ===
'[[Intuitionistic logic]]', sometimes more generally called '''constructive logic''', is a [[paracomplete]] [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]] that differs from [[classical logic]] by replacing the traditional concept of truth with the concept of [[constructive proof|constructive provability]].

The ''generalized'' law of the excluded middle is not part of the execution of [[intuitionistic logic]], but neither is it negated. Intuitionistic logic merely forbids the use of the operation as part of what it defines as a "[[constructive proof]]", which is not the same as demonstrating it invalid (this is comparable to the use of a particular building style in which screws are forbidden and only nails are allowed; it does not necessarily disprove or even question the existence or usefulness of screws, but merely demonstrates what can be built without them).

=== Paraconsistent Logic ===
'[[Paraconsistent logic]]' refers to so-called contradiction-tolerant logical systems in which a contradiction does not necessarily result in [[trivialism]]. In other words, the [[principle of explosion]] is not valid in such logics. Some (namely the dialetheists) argue that the law of non-contradiction is denied by [[dialetheic logic]]. They are motivated by certain paradoxes which seem to imply a limit of the law of non-contradiction, namely the [[Liar Paradox]]. In order to avoid a trivial logical system and still allow certain contradictions to be true, dialetheists will employ a paraconsistent logic of some kind.

=== Modal propositional calculi ===
(cf Kleene 1967:49): These "[[modal logic|calculi]]" include the symbols ⎕A, meaning "A is necessary" and ◊A meaning "A is possible". Kleene states that:
:"These notions enter in domains of thinking where there are understood to be two different kinds of "truth", one more universal or compelling than the other . . . A zoologist might declare that it is impossible that salamanders or any other living creatures can survive fire; but possible (though untrue) that unicorns exist, and possible (though improbable) that abominable snowmen exist."

=== Fuzzy logic ===
{{expand section|date=December 2017}}
'[[Fuzzy logic]]' is a form of [[many-valued logic]]; it deals with [[reasoning]] that is approximate rather than fixed and exact.

'''Leadership''' is both a research area and a practical skill encompassing the ability of an individual or [[organization]] to "lead" or guide other individuals, [[team]]s, or entire [[organization]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Specialist literature debates various viewpoints, contrasting [[Eastern world|Eastern]] and [[Western world|Western]] approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) United States versus European approaches. U.S. academic environments define leadership as "a process of [[social influence]] in which a person can enlist the aid and [[Peer support|support]] of others in the accomplishment of a common [[task (project management)|task]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= An integrative theory of leadership|last= Chemers|first= M.|publisher= Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year= 1997|isbn= 978-0-8058-2679-1|location= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chin 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Chin|first= Roger|year= 2015|title= Examining teamwork and leadership in the fields of public administration, leadership, and management|journal= Team Performance Management|volume= 21|issue= 3/4|pages= 199–216|doi= 10.1108/TPM-07-2014-0037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli by Santi di Tito.jpg|thumb| [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' argues that it is better to be feared than loved.]]

[[Aristocracy|Aristocratic]] thinkers have postulated that leadership depends on one's "blue blood" or [[gene]]s. [[Monarchy]] takes an extreme view of the same idea, and may prop up its assertions against the claims of mere aristocrats by invoking divine sanction (see the [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right of kings]]). Contrariwise, more democratically inclined theorists have pointed to examples of [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] leaders, such as the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic]] marshals profiting from [[career]]s open to [[skill|talent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transformation Of An Individual Family Community Nation And The World|last=Cano, PE|first=Librado F.|publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8D8sanxRQR8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[autocracy|autocratic]]/[[paternalism|paternalistic]] strain of thought, traditionalists recall the role of leadership of the Roman ''[[pater familias]]''. [[Feminism|Feminist]] thinking, on the other hand, may object to such models as [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] and posit against them emotionally attuned, responsive, and consensual [[empathy|empathetic]] guidance, which is sometimes associated with [[matriarchy|matriarchies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Behaviour|last1=Singh|first1=Ravinder|first2=Ajita|last2=Rani|publisher=Notion Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-946983-31-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparable to the Roman tradition, the views of [[Confucianism]] on "right living" relate very much to the ideal of the (male) scholar-leader and his benevolent rule, buttressed by a tradition of filial piety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Management, A Modern Approach|last=Saxena Dr.|first=P.K.|publisher=Global India Publications PVT LTD|year=2009|isbn=978-81-907941-5-2|location=New Delhi|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Leadership is a matter of intelligence, trustworthiness, humaneness, courage, and discipline ... Reliance on intelligence alone results in rebelliousness. Exercise of humaneness alone results in weakness. Fixation on trust results in folly. Dependence on the strength of courage results in violence. Excessive discipline and sternness in command result in cruelty. When one has all five virtues together, each appropriate to its function, then one can be a leader. — [[Sun Tzu]]&lt;ref&gt;''The 100 Greatest Leadership Principles of All Time'', edited by Leslie Pockell with Adrienne Avila, 2007, Warner Books&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Machiavelli's ''[[The Prince]]'', written in the early 16th century, provided a manual for [[Ruler (potentate)|rulers]] ("princes" or "tyrants" in Machiavelli's terminology) to gain and keep [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the 19th century the elaboration of [[anarchism|anarchist]] thought called the whole concept of leadership into question. (Note that the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' traces the word "leadership" in English only as far back as the 19th century.) One response to this denial of [[élitism]] came with [[Leninism]], which demanded an élite group of disciplined [[professional revolutionaries|cadres]] to act as the [[vanguard party|vanguard]] of a socialist revolution, bringing into existence the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].

Other historical views of leadership have addressed the seeming contrasts between secular and religious leadership. The doctrines of [[Caesaro-papism]] have recurred and had their detractors over several centuries. Christian thinking on leadership has often emphasized [[stewardship]] of divinely provided resources—human and material—and their deployment in accordance with a Divine plan. Compare [[servant leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AfjUgMJlDK4C|title=Servant Leadership: A Journey Into the Nature of Legitimate Power and Greatness|publisher=Paulist Press|year=1977|isbn=9780809105540|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|publication-date=2002|last1=Greenleaf|first1=Robert K.|author-link1=Robert K.

==Theories==

===Early western history===

The search for the characteristics or traits of leaders has continued for centuries. Philosophical writings from [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''&lt;ref&gt;
Benjamin Jowett's translation of Plato's ''Republic'' does not use the word "leadership"; Plato discusses primarily a "[[Philosopher king|guardian]]" class. See {{cite book| author = Plato| author-link1 = Plato| title = The Dialogues of Plato translated into English with Analyses and Introductions by B. Jowett, M.A.| url                   = http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/767| volume = 3| publisher = Oxford University Press| date = 1892| accessdate = 2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Plutarch's]] ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]'' have explored the question "What qualities distinguish an individual as a leader?" Underlying this search was the early recognition of the importance of leadership&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/business-learn-from-ancient-philosophers|title=What can business leaders learn from ancient philosophers?|last=Network|first=Jules Evans for the Guardian Professional|date=2012-05-04|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the assumption that leadership is rooted in the characteristics that certain individuals possess. This idea that leadership is based on individual attributes is known as the "[[trait leadership|trait theory of leadership]]".

A number of works in the 19th century – when the traditional authority of monarchs, lords and bishops had begun to wane – explored the trait theory at length: note especially the writings of [[Thomas Carlyle]] and of [[Francis Galton]], whose works have prompted decades of research. In ''Heroes and Hero Worship'' (1841), Carlyle identified the talents, skills, and physical characteristics of men who rose to power. Galton's ''Hereditary Genius'' (1869) examined leadership qualities in the families of powerful men. After showing that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when his focus moved from first-degree to second-degree relatives, Galton concluded that leadership was inherited. In other words, leaders were born, not developed. Both of these notable works lent great initial support for the notion that leadership is rooted in characteristics of a leader.

[[Cecil Rhodes]] (1853–1902) believed that public-spirited leadership could be nurtured by identifying young people with "moral force of character and instincts to lead", and educating them in contexts (such as the collegiate environment of the [[University of Oxford]]) which further developed such characteristics. International networks of such leaders could help to promote international understanding and help "render war impossible". This vision of leadership underlay the creation of the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], which have helped to shape notions of leadership since their creation in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Donald Markwell]], ''"Instincts to Lead": On Leadership, Peace, and Education'', Connor Court: Australia, 2013. {{ISBN|9781922168702}} {{cite web |url=http://www.connorcourt.com/catalog1/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=256 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222013842/http://www.connorcourt.com/catalog1/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=256 |archivedate=2017-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a series of qualitative reviews of these studies (e.g., Bird, 1940;&lt;ref&gt;Bird, C. (1940). ''Social Psychology''. New York: Appleton-Century.&lt;/ref&gt; Stogdill, 1948;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stogdill | first1 = R. M. | year = 1948 | title = Personal factors associated with leadership: A survey of the literature | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 35–71 | doi=10.1080/00223980.1948.9917362| pmid = 18901913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mann, 1959&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mann | first1 = R. D. | year = 1959 | title = A review of the relationship between personality and performance in small groups | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 241–270 | doi=10.1037/h0044587}}&lt;/ref&gt;) prompted researchers to take a drastically different view of the driving forces behind leadership. In reviewing the extant literature, Stogdill and Mann found that while some traits were common across a number of studies, the overall evidence suggested that persons who are leaders in one situation may not necessarily be leaders in other situations. Subsequently, leadership was no longer characterized as an enduring individual trait, as situational approaches (see alternative leadership theories below) posited that individuals can be effective in certain situations, but not others. The focus then shifted away from traits of leaders to an investigation of the leader behaviors that were effective. This approach dominated much of the leadership theory and research for the next few decades.

===Reemergence of trait theory===

New methods and measurements were developed after these influential reviews that would ultimately reestablish [[trait theory]] as a viable approach to the study of leadership. For example, improvements in researchers' use of the round robin research design methodology allowed researchers to see that individuals can and do emerge as leaders across a variety of situations and tasks.&lt;ref name="Kenny, D.A. 1983"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenny | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Zaccaro | first2 = S. J. | year = 1983 | title = An estimate of variance due to traits in leadership | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 68 | issue = 4| pages = 678–685 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.68.4.678}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, during the 1980s statistical advances allowed researchers to conduct [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]], in which they could quantitatively analyze and summarize the findings from a wide array of studies. This advent allowed trait theorists to create a comprehensive picture of previous leadership research rather than rely on the qualitative reviews of the past. Equipped with new methods, leadership researchers revealed the following:
* Individuals can and do emerge as leaders across a variety of situations and tasks.&lt;ref name="Kenny, D.A. 1983"/&gt;
* Significant relationships exist between leadership emergence and such individual traits as:

While the trait theory of leadership has certainly regained popularity, its reemergence has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in sophisticated conceptual frameworks.&lt;ref name="Zaccaro, S. J. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zaccaro | first1 = S. J. | year = 2007 | title = Trait-based perspectives of leadership | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 62 | issue = 1| pages = 6–16 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.62.1.6| pmid = 17209675 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.475.9808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, Zaccaro (2007)&lt;ref name="Zaccaro, S. J. 2007"/&gt; noted that trait theories still:
* Focus on a small set of individual attributes such as "The Big Five" personality traits, to the neglect of cognitive abilities, motives, values, social skills, expertise, and problem-solving skills.
* Fail to consider patterns or integrations of multiple attributes.
* Do not distinguish between the leadership attributes that are generally not malleable over time and those that are shaped by, and bound to, situational influences.
* Do not consider how stable leader attributes account for the behavioral diversity necessary for effective leadership.

===Attribute pattern approach===

Considering the criticisms of the trait theory outlined above, several researchers have begun to adopt a different perspective of leader individual differences—the leader attribute pattern approach.&lt;ref name="Foti, R.J. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foti | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Hauenstein | first2 = N. M.

D. 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, D. (1995). "Holistic interactionism: A perspective for research on personality development". In L. A. Pervin &amp; O. P. John (Eds.), ''Handbook of personality: Theory and research'' (pp. 219–247). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the leader attribute pattern approach argues that integrated constellations or combinations of individual differences may explain substantial variance in both leader emergence and leader effectiveness beyond that explained by single attributes, or by additive combinations of multiple attributes..

===Behavioral and style theories===
{{Main article|Managerial grid model}}

In response to the early criticisms of the trait approach, theorists began to research leadership as a set of behaviors, evaluating the behavior of successful leaders, determining a behavior taxonomy, and identifying broad leadership styles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSpillane2004|Spillane (2004)]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[David McClelland]], for example, posited that leadership takes a strong personality with a well-developed positive ego. To lead, self-confidence and high self-esteem are useful, perhaps even essential.&lt;ref&gt;Horton, Thomas. New York: ''The CEO Paradox'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Management Grid.PNG|right|thumb|200px|A graphical representation of the managerial grid model]]

[[Kurt Lewin]], Ronald Lipitt, and Ralph White developed in 1939 the seminal work on the influence of leadership styles and performance. The researchers evaluated the performance of groups of eleven-year-old boys under different types of work climate. In each, the leader exercised his influence regarding the type of [[group decision making]], [[praise]] and [[criticism]] ([[feedback]]), and the management of the group tasks ([[project management]]) according to three styles: [[Leadership#Autocratic or authoritarian style|authoritarian]], [[Leadership#Participative or democratic|democratic]], and [[Leadership#Laissez-faire or free rein style|laissez-faire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLewin1939|Lewin et al. (1939)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Ohio State University conducted a study which investigated observable behaviors portrayed by effective leaders, They would then identify if these particular behaviors reflective in leadership effectiveness. They were able to narrow their findings to two identifiable distinctions &lt;ref&gt;"Ohio State Leadership Studies Explained with Examples"(2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The first dimension was identified as "Initiating Structure", which described how a leader clearly and accurately communicates with their followers, defines goals, and determine how tasks are performed. These are considered "task oriented" behaviors The second dimension is "Consideration", which indicates the leader's ability to build an interpersonal relationship with their followers, to establish a form of mutual trust. These are considered "social oriented" behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;AAmodt (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Michigan State Studies, which were conducted in the 1950s, made further investigations and findings that positively correlated behaviors and leadership effectiveness. Although they similar findings as the Ohio State studies, they did contribute an additional behavior identified in leaders. This was participative behavior; allowing the followers to participate in group decision making and encouraged subordinate input. Another term used to describe this is "Servant Leadership", which entails the leader to reject a more controlling type of leadership and allow more personal interaction between themselves and their subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Stoker (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The managerial grid model is also based on a behavioral theory. The model was developed by [[Robert Blake (management)|Robert Blake]] and [[Jane Mouton]] in 1964 and suggests five different leadership styles, based on the leaders' concern for people and their concern for goal achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBlake1964|Blake et al. (1964)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Positive reinforcement====
[[B. F. Skinner]] is the father of [[behavior modification]] and developed the concept of [[positive reinforcement]]. Positive reinforcement occurs when a positive stimulus is presented in response to a behavior, increasing the likelihood of that behavior in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G., (2004). ''Behavior Modification Principles and Procedures'' (3rd ed). Belmont, California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; The following is an example of how positive reinforcement can be used in a business setting. Assume [[praise]] is a positive reinforcer for a particular employee. This employee does not show up to work on time every day. The manager of this employee decides to praise the employee for showing up on time every day the employee actually shows up to work on time. As a result, the employee comes to work on time more often because the employee likes to be praised. In this example, praise (the stimulus) is a positive reinforcer for this employee because the employee arrives at work on time (the behavior) more frequently after being praised for showing up to work on time.

The use of positive reinforcement is a successful and growing technique used by leaders to motivate and attain desired behaviors from subordinates. Organizations such as Frito-Lay, 3M, Goodrich, Michigan Bell, and Emery Air Freight have all used reinforcement to increase productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Lussier, R. N., &amp; Achua, C. F., (2010). ''Leadership, Theory, Application, &amp; Skill Development.''(4th ed). Mason, Ohio: South-Western Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research covering the last 20 years suggests that [[reinforcement theory]] has a 17 percent increase in performance. Additionally, many reinforcement techniques such as the use of praise are inexpensive, providing higher performance for lower costs.

===Situational and contingency theories===
{{Main article|Fiedler contingency model|Vroom–Yetton decision model|path–goal theory|situational leadership theory}}

[[Situational leadership theory|Situational theory]] also appeared as a reaction to the trait theory of leadership. [[social science|Social scientists]] argued that history was more than the result of intervention of great men as [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] suggested. [[Herbert Spencer]] (1884) (and [[Karl Marx]]) said that the times produce the person and not the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSpencer1841|Spencer (1884)]], apud [[#refHeifetz1994|Heifetz (1994)]], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; This theory assumes that different situations call for different characteristics; according to this group of theories, no single optimal psychographic profile of a leader exists. According to the theory, "what an individual actually does when acting as a leader is in large part dependent upon characteristics of the situation in which he functions."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHemphill1949|Hemphill (1949)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theorists started to synthesize the trait and situational approaches. Building upon the research of Lewin et al., academics began to normalize the descriptive models of leadership climates, defining three leadership styles and identifying which situations each style works better in. The authoritarian leadership style, for example, is approved in periods of crisis but fails to win the "hearts and minds" of followers in day-to-day management; the democratic leadership style is more adequate in situations that require consensus building; finally, the laissez-faire leadership style is appreciated for the degree of freedom it provides, but as the leaders do not "take charge", they can be perceived as a failure in protracted or thorny organizational problems.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWormer2007|Wormer et al. (2007)]], p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, theorists defined the style of leadership as contingent to the situation, which is sometimes classified as contingency theory. Four contingency leadership theories appear more prominently in recent years: Fiedler contingency model, Vroom-Yetton decision model, the path-goal theory, and the Hersey-Blanchard situational theory.

The [[Fiedler contingency model]] bases the leader's effectiveness on what [[Fred Fiedler]] called ''situational contingency''. This results from the interaction of leadership style and situational favorability (later called ''situational control''). The theory defined two types of leader: those who tend to accomplish the task by developing good relationships with the group (relationship-oriented), and those who have as their prime concern carrying out the task itself (task-oriented).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFiedler1967|Fiedler (1967)]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fiedler, there is no ideal leader. Both task-oriented and relationship-oriented leaders can be effective if their leadership orientation fits the situation. When there is a good leader-member relation, a highly structured task, and high leader position power, the situation is considered a "favorable situation". Fiedler found that task-oriented leaders are more effective in extremely favorable or unfavorable situations, whereas relationship-oriented leaders perform best in situations with intermediate favorability.

[[Victor Vroom]], in collaboration with Phillip Yetton (1973)&lt;ref&gt;[[#refVroom1973|Vroom, Yetton (1973)]]&lt;/ref&gt; and later with Arthur Jago (1988),&lt;ref&gt;[[#refVroom1988|Vroom, Jago (1988)]]&lt;/ref&gt; developed a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] for describing leadership situations, which was used in a normative [[Vroom-Yetton decision model|decision model]] where leadership styles were connected to situational variables, defining which approach was more suitable to which situation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSternberg2002|Sternberg, Vroom (2002)]]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was novel because it supported the idea that the same manager could rely on different [[group decision making]] approaches depending on the attributes of each situation. This model was later referred to as situational contingency theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLorsch1974|Lorsch (1974)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[path-goal theory]] of leadership was developed by Robert House (1971) and was based on the [[expectancy theory]] of [[Victor Vroom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHouse1971|House (1971)]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to House, the essence of the theory is "the meta proposition that leaders, to be effective, engage in behaviors that complement subordinates' environments and abilities in a manner that compensates for deficiencies and is instrumental to subordinate satisfaction and individual and work unit performance".&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHouse1996|House (1996)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The theory identifies four leader behaviors, ''achievement-oriented'', ''directive'', ''participative'', and ''supportive'', that are contingent to the environment factors and follower characteristics. In contrast to the [[Fiedler contingency model]], the path-goal model states that the four leadership behaviors are fluid, and that leaders can adopt any of the four depending on what the situation demands. The path-goal model can be classified both as a [[Contingency leadership theory|contingency theory]], as it depends on the circumstances, and as a [[Transactional leadership|transactional leadership theory]], as the theory emphasizes the reciprocity behavior between the leader and the followers.

The [[Hersey-Blanchard situational theory|Situational Leadership® Model]] proposed by Hersey suggests four leadership-styles and four levels of follower-development. For effectiveness, the model posits that the leadership-style must match the appropriate level of follower-development. In this model, leadership behavior becomes a function not only of the characteristics of the leader, but of the characteristics of followers as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHersey2008|Hersey et al. (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functional theory===
{{Main article|Functional leadership model}}
[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 100805-F-7552L-211 - Commander of the International Security Assistance Force Gen. David H. Petraeus center U.S. Army talks with U.S. soldiers of the 2nd Battalion.jpg|thumb|250px|General Petraeus talks with U.S. soldiers serving in Afghanistan]]
Functional leadership theory (Hackman &amp; Walton, 1986; [[McGrath]], 1962; Adair, 1988; Kouzes &amp; Posner, 1995) is a particularly useful theory for addressing specific leader behaviors expected to contribute to organizational or unit effectiveness. This theory argues that the leader's main job is to see that whatever is necessary to group needs is taken care of; thus, a leader can be said to have done their job well when they have contributed to group effectiveness and cohesion (Fleishman et al., 1991; Hackman &amp; Wageman, 2005; Hackman &amp; Walton, 1986). While functional leadership theory has most often been applied to team leadership (Zaccaro, Rittman, &amp; Marks, 2001), it has also been effectively applied to broader organizational leadership as well (Zaccaro, 2001). In summarizing literature on functional leadership (see Kozlowski et al. (1996), Zaccaro et al. (2001), Hackman and Walton (1986), Hackman &amp; Wageman (2005), Morgeson (2005)), Klein, Zeigert, Knight, and Xiao (2006) observed five broad functions a leader performs when promoting organization's effectiveness. These functions include environmental monitoring, organizing subordinate activities, teaching and coaching subordinates, motivating others, and intervening actively in the group's work.

A variety of leadership behaviors are expected to facilitate these functions. In initial work identifying leader behavior, Fleishman (1953) observed that subordinates perceived their supervisors' behavior in terms of two broad categories referred to as [[consideration and initiating structure]]. Consideration includes behavior involved in fostering effective relationships. Examples of such behavior would include showing concern for a subordinate or acting in a supportive manner towards others. Initiating structure involves the actions of the leader focused specifically on task accomplishment. This could include role clarification, setting performance standards, and holding subordinates accountable to those standards.

===Integrated psychological theory===
{{Main article|Three Levels of Leadership model}}

The Integrated Psychological theory of leadership is an attempt to integrate the strengths of the older theories (i.e. traits, behavioral/styles, situational and functional) while addressing their limitations, largely by introducing a new element – the need for leaders to develop their leadership presence, attitude toward others and behavioral flexibility by practicing psychological mastery. It also offers a foundation for leaders wanting to apply the philosophies of [[servant leadership]] and [[authentic leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;Businessballs management information website – Leadership Theories page, "Integrated Psychological Approach" section: http://www.businessballs.com/leadership-theories.htm#integrated-psychological-leadership&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated Psychological theory began to attract attention after the publication of James Scouller's [[Three Levels of Leadership model]] (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Scouller, J. (2011). ''The Three Levels of Leadership: How to Develop Your Leadership Presence, Knowhow and Skill''. Cirencester: Management Books 2000., {{ISBN|9781852526818}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scouller argued that the older theories offer only limited assistance in developing a person's ability to lead effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Scouller, J. (2011), pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;
He pointed out, for example, that:
* Traits theories, which tend to reinforce the idea that leaders are born not made, might help us select leaders, but they are less useful for developing leaders.
* An ideal style (e.g. Blake &amp; Mouton's team style) would not suit all circumstances.
* Most of the situational/contingency and functional theories assume that leaders can change their behavior to meet differing circumstances or widen their behavioral range at will, when in practice many find it hard to do so because of unconscious beliefs, fears or ingrained habits. Thus, he argued, leaders need to work on their inner psychology.
* None of the old theories successfully address the challenge of developing "[[Three Levels of Leadership model#Leadership presence|leadership presence]]"; that certain "something" in leaders that commands attention, inspires people, wins their trust and makes followers want to work with them.

Scouller proposed the Three Levels of Leadership model, which was later categorized as an "Integrated Psychological" theory on the Businessballs education website.&lt;ref&gt;Businessballs information website: Leadership Theories Page, Integrated Psychological Approach section. Businessballs.com.: http://www.businessballs.com/leadership-theories.htm#integrated-psychological-leadership 2012-02-24. Retrieved 2012-08-15&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, his model aims to summarize what leaders have to do, not only to bring leadership to their group or organization, but also to develop themselves technically and psychologically as leaders.

The three levels in his model are Public, Private and Personal leadership:
* The first two – public and private leadership – are "outer" or behavioral levels. These are the behaviors that address what Scouller called "the four dimensions of leadership". These dimensions are: (1) a shared, motivating group purpose; (2) action, progress and results; (3) collective unity or team spirit; (4) individual selection and motivation. [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Public leadership|Public leadership]] focuses on the 34 behaviors involved in influencing two or more people simultaneously. [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Private leadership|Private leadership]] covers the 14 behaviors needed to influence individuals one to one.
* The third – [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Personal leadership|personal leadership]] – is an "inner" level and concerns a person's growth toward greater leadership presence, knowhow and skill. Working on one's personal leadership has three aspects: (1) Technical knowhow and skill (2) Developing the right attitude toward other people – which is the basis of servant leadership (3) Psychological self-mastery – the foundation for authentic leadership.

Scouller argued that self-mastery is the key to growing one's leadership presence, building trusting relationships with followers and dissolving one's limiting beliefs and habits, thereby enabling behavioral flexibility as circumstances change, while staying connected to one's core values (that is, while remaining authentic). To support leaders' development, he introduced a new model of the human psyche and outlined the principles and techniques of self-mastery, which include the practice of [[Mindfulness#Mindfulness meditation in organizations|mindfulness meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;Scouller, J. (2011), pp. 137–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transactional and transformational theories===
{{Main article|Transactional leadership|Transformational leadership}}

Bernard Bass and colleagues developed the idea of two different types of leadership, transactional that involves exchange of labor for rewards and transformational which is based on concern for employees, intellectual stimulation, and providing a group vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bass | first1 = B.

M., &amp; Riggio, R. E. (2006). ''Transformational leadership'' (2nd ed.). Mahwah, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers; US.&lt;/ref&gt;

The transactional leader ([[James MacGregor Burns|Burns]], 1978)&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;{{cite book| last = Burns| first = J. M.| authorlink =James MacGregor Burns| title = Leadership| publisher = Harper and Row Publishers Inc.| year = 1978| location = New York| isbn = 978-0060105884}}&lt;/ref&gt; is given power to perform certain tasks and reward or punish for the team's performance. It gives the opportunity to the manager to lead the group and the group agrees to follow his lead to accomplish a predetermined goal in exchange for something else. Power is given to the leader to evaluate, correct, and train subordinates when productivity is not up to the desired level, and reward effectiveness when expected outcome is reached.

===Leader–member exchange theory===

This LMX theory addresses a specific aspect of the leadership process is the leader–member exchange (LMX) theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graen | first1 = G. B. | last2 = Novak | first2 = M. A. | last3 = Sommerkamp | first3 = P. | year = 1982 | title = The effects of leader-member exchange and job design on productivity and satisfaction: Testing a dual attachment model | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior &amp; Human Performance | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 109–131 | doi = 10.1016/0030-5073(82)90236-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which evolved from an earlier theory called the vertical dyad linkage (VDL) model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dansereau | first1 = F. | last2 = Graen | first2 = G. | last3 = Haga | first3 = W. J. | year = 1975 | title = A vertical dyad linkage approach to leadership within formal organizations: A longitudinal investigation of the role making process | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior &amp; Human Performance | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 46–78 | doi=10.1016/0030-5073(75)90005-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these models focus on the interaction between leaders and individual followers. Similar to the transactional approach, this interaction is viewed as a fair exchange whereby the leader provides certain benefits such as task guidance, advice, support, and/or significant rewards and the followers reciprocate by giving the leader respect, cooperation, commitment to the task and good performance. However, LMX recognizes that leaders and individual followers will vary in the type of exchange that develops between them.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P."&gt;{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; LMX theorizes that the type of exchanges between the leader and specific followers can lead to the creation of ''in-groups'' and ''out-groups''. In-group members are said to have ''high-quality exchanges'' with the leader, while out-group members have ''low-quality exchanges'' with the leader.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In-group members====

[[In-group]] members are perceived by the leader as being more experienced, competent, and willing to assume responsibility than other followers. The leader begins to rely on these individuals to help with especially challenging tasks. If the follower responds well, the leader rewards him/her with extra coaching, favorable job assignments, and developmental experiences. If the follower shows high commitment and effort followed by additional rewards, both parties develop mutual trust, influence, and support of one another. Research shows the in-group members usually receive higher performance evaluations from the leader, higher satisfaction, and faster promotions than out-group members.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P."/&gt; In-group members are also likely to build stronger bonds with their leaders by sharing the same social backgrounds and interests.

====Out-group members====

[[Ingroups and outgroups|Out-group]] members often receive less time and more distant exchanges than their in-group counterparts. With out-group members, leaders expect no more than adequate [[job performance]], good attendance, reasonable respect, and adherence to the job description in exchange for a [[living wage|fair wage]] and standard benefits. The leader spends less time with out-group members, they have fewer developmental experiences, and the leader tends to emphasize his/her formal authority to obtain compliance to leader requests. Research shows that out-group members are less satisfied with their job and organization, receive lower performance evaluations from the leader, see their leader as less fair, and are more likely to file grievances or leave the organization.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P."/&gt;

===Emotions===
{{see also|Emotional intelligence}}
Leadership can be perceived as a particularly emotion-laden process, with emotions entwined with the social influence process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = George | first1 = J. M. | year = 2000 | title = Emotions and leadership: The role of emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Human Relations | volume = 53 | issue = 8| pages = 1027–1055 | doi=10.1177/0018726700538001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an organization, the leader's mood has some effects on his/her group. These effects can be described in three levels:&lt;ref name=cote&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sy | first=T.| last2=Cote | first2=S.| last3=Saavedra | first3=R.| year=2005| title=The contagious leader: Impact of the leader's mood on the mood of group members, group affective tone, and group processes| journal=Journal of Applied Psychology| volume=90 | issue=2| pages=295–305| url=http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~scote/SyetalJAP.pdf| doi=10.1037/0021-9010.90.2.295| pmid=15769239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The mood of individual group members. Group members with leaders in a positive mood experience more positive mood than do group members with leaders in a negative mood. The leaders transmit their moods to other group members through the mechanism of [[emotional contagion]].&lt;ref name=cote/&gt; Mood contagion may be one of the psychological mechanisms by which [[charismatic]] leaders influence followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bono | first1 = J. E. | last2 = Ilies | first2 = R. | year = 2006 | title = Charisma, positive emotions and mood contagion | url = | journal = The Leadership Quarterly | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 317–334 | doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2006.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The affective tone of the group. [[Group affective tone]] represents the consistent or homogeneous affective reactions within a group. Group affective tone is an aggregate of the moods of the individual members of the group and refers to mood at the group level of analysis. Groups with leaders in a positive mood have a more positive affective tone than do groups with leaders in a negative mood.&lt;ref name=cote/&gt;
# Group processes like coordination, effort expenditure, and [[Task (project management)|task]] [[strategy]]. Public expressions of mood impact how group members think and act. When people experience and express mood, they send signals to others. Leaders signal their goals, intentions, and attitudes through their expressions of moods. For example, expressions of positive moods by leaders signal that leaders deem progress toward goals to be good. The group members respond to those signals cognitively and behaviorally in ways that are reflected in the group processes.&lt;ref name=cote/&gt;
In research about client service, it was found that expressions of positive mood by the [[leader]] improve the performance of the group, although in other sectors there were other findings.&lt;ref name=george&gt;George J. M. 2006. "Leader Positive Mood and Group Performance: The Case of Customer Service". ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology'' 25(9): pp. 778–794&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the leader's mood, her/his behavior is a source for employee positive and negative [[emotions]] at work. The leader creates situations and events that lead to emotional response. Certain leader behaviors displayed during interactions with their employees are the sources of these affective events. Leaders shape workplace affective events. Examples – feedback giving, allocating tasks, resource distribution. Since employee behavior and productivity are directly affected by their emotional states, it is imperative to consider employee emotional responses to organizational leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dasborough | first1 = M. T. | year = 2006 | title = Cognitive asymmetry in employee emotional reactions to leadership behaviors | url = | journal = The Leadership Quarterly | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 163–178 | doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2005.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage moods and emotions in the self and others, contributes to effective leadership within organizations.&lt;ref name=george/&gt;

===Neo-emergent theory===
{{Main article|Functional leadership model}}

The neo-emergent leadership theory (from the Oxford Strategic Leadership Programme) sees leadership as created through the emergence of information by the leader or other stakeholders, not through the true actions of the leader himself.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} In other words, the reproduction of information or [[narrative|stories]] form the basis of the perception of leadership by the majority. It is well known{{by whom|date=August 2014}} that the naval hero [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] often wrote his own versions of battles he was involved in, so that when he arrived home in England he would receive a true hero's welcome.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} In modern society, the press, blogs and other sources report their own views of leaders, which may be based on reality, but may also be based on a political command, a payment, or an inherent interest of the author, media, or leader. Therefore, one can argue that the perception of all leaders is created and in fact does not reflect their true leadership qualities at all.

== Leadership emergence ==
Many personality characteristics were found to be reliably associated with leadership emergence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Group Dynamics|last=Forsyth|first=Donelson|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2010|isbn=|location=Belmont, California|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list include, but is not limited to following (list organized in alphabetical order): assertiveness, authenticity, Big Five personality factors, birth order, character strengths, dominance, emotional intelligence, gender identity, intelligence, narcissism, self-efficacy for leadership, self-monitoring and social motivation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Leadership emergence is the idea that people born with specific characteristics become leaders, and those without these characteristics do not become leaders.  People like Mahatma Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln, and Nelson Mandela all share traits that an average person does not.  This includes people who choose to participate in leadership roles, as opposed to those who do not.  Research indicates that up to 30% of leader emergence has a genetic basis.&lt;ref&gt;Aamodt, M. G. (2010). I/O applications workbook: Industrial/organizational psychology an applied approach. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;
There is no current research indicating that there is a “leadership gene”, instead we inherit certain traits that might influence our decision to seek leadership.  Both anecdotal, and empirical evidence support a stable relationship between specific traits and leadership behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Law, J. R. (1996). Rising to the occasion: foundations, processes, and outcomes of emergent leadership.&lt;/ref&gt; Using a large international sample researchers found that there are three factors that motivate leaders; affective identity (enjoyment of leading), non-calculative (leading earns reinforcement), and social-normative (sense of obligation).&lt;ref&gt;Chan, K., &amp; Drasgow, F. (2001). Toward a theory of individual differences and leadership: Understanding the motivation to lead. Journal of Applied Psychology, 86(3), 481-498. doi:10.1037/0021-9010.86.3.481&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assertiveness ===

The relationship between assertiveness and leadership emergence is curvilinear; individuals who are either low in assertiveness or very high in assertiveness are less likely to be identified as leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ames|first=Daniel R.|last2=Flynn|first2=Francis J.|title=What breaks a leader: The curvilinear relation between assertiveness and leadership.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=92|issue=2|pages=307–324|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.2.307|pmid=17279851|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Authenticity ===

Individuals who are more aware of their personality qualities, including their values and beliefs, and are less biased when processing self-relevant information, are more likely to be accepted as leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ilies|first=Remus|last2=Morgeson|first2=Frederick P.|last3=Nahrgang|first3=Jennifer D.|date=2005-06-01|title=Authentic leadership and eudaemonic well-being: Understanding leader–follower outcomes|url=https://scholars.opb.msu.edu/en/publications/authentic-leadership-and-eudaemonic-well-being-understanding-lead-2|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=373–394|doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2005.03.002|issn=1048-9843|citeseerx=10.1.1.318.5548}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Authentic leadership|Authentic Leadership]].

=== Big Five personality factors ===

Those who emerge as leaders tend to be more (order in strength of relationship with leadership emergence): extroverted, conscientious, emotionally stable, and open to experience, although these tendencies are stronger in laboratory studies of leaderless groups.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Judge|first=Timothy A.|last2=Bono|first2=Joyce E.|last3=Ilies|first3=Remus|last4=Gerhardt|first4=Megan W.|title=Personality and leadership: A qualitative and quantitative review.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.87.4.765|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=87|issue=4|pages=765–780|doi=10.1037//0021-9010.87.4.765|year=2002|citeseerx=10.1.1.301.9866}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agreeableness, the last factor of the Big Five personality traits, does not seem to play any meaningful role in leadership emergence &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Birth order ===

Those born first in their families and only children are hypothesized to be more driven to seek leadership and control in social settings. Middle-born children tend to accept follower roles in groups, and later-borns are thought to be rebellious and creative &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Character strengths ===

Those seeking leadership positions in a military organization had elevated scores on a number of indicators of strength of character, including honesty, hope, bravery, industry, and teamwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=Michael D.|last2=Eid|first2=Jarle|last3=Kelly|first3=Dennis|last4=Bailey|first4=Jennifer K. S.|last5=Peterson|first5=Christopher|title=Character strengths and virtues of developing military leaders: An international comparison.|journal=Military Psychology|volume=18|issue=Suppl|pages=S57–S68|doi=10.1207/s15327876mp1803s_5|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominance ===

Individuals with dominant personalities – they describe themselves as high in the desire to control their environment and influence other people, and are likely to express their opinions in a forceful way – are more likely to act as leaders in small-group situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223344605|title=A pattern approach to leader emergence|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Emotional intelligence ===

Individuals with high emotional intelligence have increased ability to understand and relate to people. They have skills in communicating and decoding emotions and they deal with others wisely and effectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such people communicate their ideas in more robust ways, are better able to read the politics of a situation, are less likely to lose control of their emotions, are less likely to be inappropriately angry or critical, and in consequence are more likely to emerge as leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New leaders |isbn=9780751533811|oclc=891670377|last1 = Goleman|first1 = Daniel|last2=Boyatzis|first2=Richard E.|last3=McKee|first3=Annie|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender identity ===

Masculine individuals are more likely to emerge as leaders than are feminine individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lord|first=Robert G.|last2=Vader|first2=Christy L. de|last3=Alliger|first3=George M.|title=A meta-analysis of the relation between personality traits and leadership perceptions: An application of validity generalization procedures.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=71|issue=3|pages=402–410|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.71.3.402|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intelligence ===

Individuals with higher intelligence exhibit superior judgement, higher verbal skills (both written and oral), quicker learning and acquisition of knowledge, and are more likely to emerge as leaders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Correlation between IQ and leadership emergence was found to be between .25 and .30.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bass &amp; Stogdill's handbook of leadership : theory, research, and managerial applications Bass and Stogdill's handbook of leade.|last=Melvin.|first=Stogdill, Ralph|date=1990-01-01|publisher=Free Press|isbn=9780029015001|oclc=959443394}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, groups generally prefer leaders that do not exceed intelligence prowess of average member by a wide margin, as they fear that high intelligence may be translated to differences in communication, trust, interests and values&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simonton|first=Dean K.|title=Intelligence and personal influence in groups: Four nonlinear models.|journal=Psychological Review|volume=92|issue=4|pages=532–547|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.92.4.532|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narcissism ===

Individuals who take on leadership roles in turbulent situations, such as groups facing a threat or ones in which status is determined by intense competition among rivals within the group, tend to be narcissistic: arrogant, self-absorbed, hostile, and very self-confident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223046510|title=Narcissistic Leadership (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-efficacy for leadership ===

Confidence in one's ability to lead is associated with increases in willingness to accept a leadership role and success in that role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoyt|first=C. L.|last2=Blascovich|first2=J.|date=2016-07-26|title=Leadership Efficacy and Women Leaders' Responses to Stereotype Activation|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=595–616|doi=10.1177/1368430207084718|url=http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/22845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-monitoring ===

High self-monitors are more likely to emerge as the leader of a group than are low self-monitors, since they are more concerned with status-enhancement and are more likely to adapt their actions to fit the demands of the situation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222434830|title=Can chameleons lead? (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social motivation ===

Individuals who are both success-oriented and affiliation-oriented, as assessed by projective measures, are more active in group problem-solving settings and are more likely to be elected to positions of leadership in such groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorrentino|first=Richard M.|last2=Field|first2=Nigel|title=Emergent leadership over time: The functional value of positive motivation.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=50|issue=6|pages=1091–1099|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.6.1091|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership styles==
{{Main article|Leadership styles}}
A leadership style is a leader's style of providing direction, implementing plans, and motivating people. It is the result of the philosophy, personality, and experience of the leader. Rhetoric specialists have also developed models for understanding leadership ([[Robert Hariman]], ''Political Style'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hariman]], ''Political Style'', U of Chicago Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination''&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination'', Paris, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;).

Different situations call for different leadership styles. In an emergency when there is little time to converge on an agreement and where a designated authority has significantly more experience or expertise than the rest of the team, an autocratic leadership style may be most effective; however, in a highly motivated and aligned team with a homogeneous level of expertise, a more democratic or [[Laissez-faire]] style may be more effective. The style adopted should be the one that most effectively achieves the objectives of the group while balancing the interests of its individual members.&lt;ref name=Lewin&gt;{{cite journal| last=Lewin | first=K.| author-link=Kurt Lewin| last2=Lippitt | first2=R.| last3=White | first3=R. K.| year=1939| title=Patterns of aggressive behavior in experimentally created social climates| journal=Journal of Social Psychology| volume=10| pages=271–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A field in which leadership style has gained strong attention is that of military science, recently expressing a holistic and integrated view of leadership, including how a leader's physical presence determines how others perceive that leader. The factors of physical presence are military bearing, physical fitness, confidence, and resilience. The leader's intellectual capacity helps to conceptualize solutions and acquire knowledge to do the job. A leader's conceptual abilities apply agility, judgment, innovation, interpersonal tact, and [[domain knowledge]]. Domain knowledge for leaders encompasses tactical and technical knowledge as well as cultural and geopolitical awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Headquarters, Department of the Army (2006). "Army Leadership. Competent, Confident, and Agile". FM 6-22. Washington, D.C., 12 October 2006 p. 18. Publication available at Army Knowledge Online (www.us.army.mil) and General Dennis J. Reimer Training and Doctrine Digital Library at (www.train.army.mil).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autocratic or authoritarian===

Under the [[autocratic]] leadership style, all decision-making powers are centralized in the leader, as with [[dictator]]s.

Autocratic leaders do not entertain any suggestions or initiatives from subordinates. The autocratic management has been successful as it provides strong motivation to the manager. It permits quick decision-making, as only one person decides for the whole group and keeps each decision to him/herself until he/she feels it needs to be shared with the rest of the group.&lt;ref name=Lewin/&gt;

===Participative or democratic===
The democratic leadership style consists of the leader sharing the decision-making abilities with group members by promoting the interests of the group members and by practicing social equality. This has also been called [[shared leadership]].

=== Laissez-faire or Free-rein ===
In Laissez-faire or free-rein leadership, decision-making is passed on to the sub-ordinates. The sub-ordinates are given complete right and power to make decisions to establish goals and work out the problems or hurdles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317115085|title=(PDF) Modern leadership and management methods for development organizations|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Task-oriented and relationship-oriented===
{{Main article|Task-oriented and relationship-oriented leadership}}
Task-oriented leadership is a style in which the leader is focused on the tasks that need to be performed in order to meet a certain production goal. Task-oriented leaders are generally more concerned with producing a step-by-step solution for given problem or goal, strictly making sure these deadlines are met, results and reaching target outcomes.

Relationship-oriented leadership is a contrasting style in which the leader is more focused on the relationships amongst the group and is generally more concerned with the overall well-being and satisfaction of group members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Ronald J. Ebert, Ricky W.|title=Business essentials|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-705349-0|pages=135–136|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relationship-oriented leaders emphasize communication within the group, show trust and confidence in group members, and show appreciation for work done.

Task-oriented leaders are typically less concerned with the idea of catering to group members, and more concerned with acquiring a certain solution to meet a production goal. For this reason, they typically are able to make sure that deadlines are met, yet their group members' well-being may suffer. Relationship-oriented leaders are focused on developing the team and the relationships in it. The positives to having this kind of environment are that team members are more motivated and have support. However, the emphasis on relations as opposed to getting a job done might make productivity suffer.

==Leadership differences affected by gender==
{{One source|section|date=February 2013}}
Another factor that covaries with leadership style is whether the person is male or female. When men and women come together in groups, they tend to adopt different leadership styles. Men generally assume an [[:agentic leadership]] style. They are task-oriented, active, decision focused, independent and goal oriented. Women, on the other hand, are generally more communal when they assume a leadership position; they strive to be helpful towards others, warm in relation to others, understanding, and mindful of others' feelings. In general, when women are asked to describe themselves to others in newly formed groups, they emphasize their open, fair, responsible, and pleasant communal qualities. They give advice, offer assurances, and manage conflicts in an attempt to maintain positive relationships among group members. Women connect more positively to group members by smiling, maintaining eye contact and respond tactfully to others' comments. Men, conversely, describe themselves as influential, powerful and proficient at the task that needs to be done. They tend to place more focus on initiating structure within the group, setting standards and objectives, identifying roles, defining responsibilities and standard operating procedures, proposing solutions to problems, monitoring compliance with procedures, and finally, emphasizing the need for productivity and efficiency in the work that needs to be done. As leaders, men are primarily task-oriented, but women tend to be both task- and relationship-oriented. However, it is important to note that these sex differences are only tendencies, and do not manifest themselves within men and women across all groups and situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D. R.|title=Group dynamics|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth|location=New York|isbn=978-0495599524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
In the past, some researchers have argued that the actual influence of leaders on organizational outcomes is overrated and romanticized as a result of biased attributions about leaders (Meindl &amp; Ehrlich, 1987). Despite these assertions, however, it is largely recognized and accepted by practitioners and researchers that leadership is important, and research supports the notion that leaders do contribute to key organizational outcomes (Day &amp; Lord, 1988; Kaiser, Hogan, &amp; Craig, 2008). To facilitate successful performance it is important to understand and accurately measure leadership performance.

Job performance generally refers to behavior that is expected to contribute to organizational success (Campbell, 1990). Campbell identified a number of specific types of performance dimensions; leadership was one of the dimensions that he identified. There is no consistent, overall definition of leadership performance (Yukl, 2006). Many distinct conceptualizations are often lumped together under the umbrella of leadership [[performance]], including outcomes such as leader [[effectiveness]], leader advancement, and leader emergence (Kaiser et al., 2008). For instance, leadership performance may be used to refer to the career success of the individual leader, performance of the group or organization, or even leader emergence. Each of these measures can be considered conceptually distinct. While these aspects may be related, they are different outcomes and their inclusion should depend on the applied or research focus.

"Another way to conceptualize leader performance is to focus on the outcomes of the leader’s followers, group, team, unit, or organization. In evaluating this type of leader performance, two general strategies are typically used. The first relies on subjective perceptions of the leader’s performance from subordinates, superiors, or occasionally peers or other parties. The other type of effectiveness measures are more objective indicators of follower or unit performance, such as measures of productivity, goal attainment, sales figures, or unit financial performance (Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006, p. 47)."
&lt;ref&gt;Bass, B. M. and Riggio, R. E. (Eds.). (2006). Transformational Leadership (2nd ed). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[toxic leader]] is someone who has responsibility over a group of people or an organization, and who abuses the leader–follower relationship by leaving the group or organization in a worse-off condition than when he/she joined it.

==Traits==
[[File:0092 - Wien - Kunsthistorisches Museum - Gaius Julius Caesar-edit.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Julius Caesar]], one of the world's greatest military leaders]]
Most theories in the 20th century argued that great leaders were born, not made. Current studies have indicated that leadership is much more complex and cannot be boiled down to a few key traits of an individual. Years of observation and study have indicated that one such trait or a set of traits does not make an extraordinary leader. What scholars have been able to arrive at is that leadership traits of an individual do not change from situation to situation; such traits include intelligence, assertiveness, or physical attractiveness.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P. 4-6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, each key trait may be applied to situations differently, depending on the circumstances. The following summarizes the main leadership traits found in research by Jon P. Howell, business professor at New Mexico State University and author of the book ''Snapshots of Great Leadership''.

Determination and drive include traits such as initiative, energy, assertiveness, perseverance and sometimes dominance. People with these traits often tend to wholeheartedly pursue their goals, work long hours, are ambitious, and often are very competitive with others. Cognitive capacity includes intelligence, analytical and verbal ability, behavioral flexibility, and good judgment. Individuals with these traits are able to formulate solutions to difficult problems, work well under stress or deadlines, adapt to changing situations, and create well-thought-out plans for the future. Howell provides examples of Steve Jobs and Abraham Lincoln as encompassing the traits of determination and drive as well as possessing cognitive capacity, demonstrated by their ability to adapt to their continuously changing environments.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P. 4-6"/&gt;

Self-confidence encompasses the traits of high self-esteem, assertiveness, emotional stability, and self-assurance. Individuals who are self-confident do not doubt themselves or their abilities and decisions; they also have the ability to project this self-confidence onto others, building their trust and commitment. Integrity is demonstrated in individuals who are truthful, trustworthy, principled, consistent, dependable, loyal, and not deceptive. Leaders with integrity often share these values with their followers, as this trait is mainly an ethics issue. It is often said that these leaders keep their word and are honest and open with their cohorts. Sociability describes individuals who are friendly, extroverted, tactful, flexible, and interpersonally competent. Such a trait enables leaders to be accepted well by the public, use diplomatic measures to solve issues, as well as hold the ability to adapt their social persona to the situation at hand. According to Howell, Mother Teresa is an exceptional example who embodies integrity, assertiveness, and social abilities in her diplomatic dealings with the leaders of the world.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P. 4-6"/&gt;

Few great leaders encompass all of the traits listed above, but many have the ability to apply a number of them to succeed as front-runners of their organization or situation.

==Ontological-phenomenological model==
One of the more recent definitions of leadership comes from [[Werner Erhard]], [[Michael C. Jensen]], Steve Zaffron, and Kari Granger who describe leadership as "an exercise in language that results in the realization of a future that wasn't going to happen anyway, which future fulfills (or contributes to fulfilling) the concerns of the relevant parties...". This definition ensures that leadership is talking about the future and includes the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties.  This differs from relating to the relevant parties as "followers" and calling up an image of a single leader with others following.  Rather, a future that fulfills on the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties indicates the future that wasn't going to happen is not the "idea of the leader", but rather is what emerges from digging deep to find the underlying concerns of those who are impacted by the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Forthcoming in "The Handbook for Teaching Leadership", by Werner Erhard, Michael, C. Jensen, &amp; Kari Granger; Scott Snook, Nitin Nohria, Rakesh Khurana (Editors) http://ssrn.com/abstract=1681682&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contexts==

===Organizations===
An organization that is established as an [[Legal instrument|instrument]] or means for achieving defined [[Goal|objectives]] has been referred to as a ''formal organization''. Its design specifies how goals are subdivided and reflected in subdivisions of the organization. Divisions, departments, sections, positions, jobs, and tasks make up this work [[structure]]. Thus, the formal organization is expected to behave impersonally in regard to relationships with clients or with its members. According to Weber's definition, entry and subsequent advancement is by merit or seniority. Employees receive a salary and enjoy a degree of tenure that safeguards them from the arbitrary influence of superiors or of powerful clients. The higher one's position in the hierarchy, the greater one's presumed expertise in adjudicating problems that may arise in the course of the work carried out at lower levels of the organization. It is this bureaucratic structure that forms the basis for the appointment of heads or chiefs of administrative subdivisions in the organization and endows them with the authority attached to their position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Cecil A Gibb|title= Leadership (Handbook of Social Psychology)|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts|year=1970|pages=884–89|isbn= 9780140805178|oclc=174777513|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the appointed head or chief of an administrative unit, a leader emerges within the context of the ''informal organization'' that underlies the formal structure. The informal organization expresses the personal [[Goal|objectives]] and [[goal]]s of the individual [[wikt:Membership|membership]]. Their objectives and goals may or may not coincide with those of the formal organization. The informal organization represents an extension of the social structures that generally characterize human life — the spontaneous emergence of groups and organizations as ends in themselves.

In prehistoric times, humanity was preoccupied with personal security, maintenance, protection, and survival. Now humanity spends a major portion of waking hours working for organizations. The need to identify with a community that provides security, protection, maintenance, and a feeling of belonging has continued unchanged from prehistoric times. This need is met by the informal organization and its emergent, or unofficial, leaders.&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Henry P. Knowles |author2=Borje O. Saxberg |title=Personality and Leadership Behavior|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts|year=1971|pages=884–89|isbn= 9780140805178|oclc= 118832|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Vugt, M., Hogan, R., &amp; Kaiser, R. (2008). "Leadership, followership, and evolution": Some lessons from the past. ''American Psychologist'', 63, 182–196.[https://web.archive.org/web/20140411195727/http://www.professormarkvanvugt.com/files/LeadershipFollowershipandEvolution-AmericanPsychologist-2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders emerge from within the structure of the informal organization. Their personal qualities, the demands of the situation, or a combination of these and other factors attract followers who accept their leadership within one or several overlay structures. Instead of the authority of position held by an appointed head or chief, the emergent leader wields influence or power. Influence is the ability of a person to gain co-operation from others by means of persuasion or control over rewards. Power is a stronger form of influence because it reflects a person's ability to enforce action through the control of a means of punishment.&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;

A leader is a person who influences a group of people towards a specific result. It is not dependent on title or formal authority. (Elevos, paraphrased from Leaders, Bennis, and Leadership Presence, Halpern &amp; Lubar.) Ogbonnia (2007) defines an effective leader "as an individual with the capacity to consistently succeed in a given condition and be viewed as meeting the expectations of an organization or society." Leaders are recognized by their capacity for caring for others, clear communication, and a commitment to persist.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyle, John R. ''Leadership and Futuring: Making Visions Happen''. Thousand Oaks, California: Corwin Press, Inc., 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; An individual who is appointed to a managerial position has the right to command and enforce obedience by virtue of the authority of their position. However, she or he must possess adequate personal attributes to match this authority, because authority is only potentially available to him/her. In the absence of sufficient personal competence, a manager may be confronted by an emergent leader who can challenge her/his role in the organization and reduce it to that of a figurehead. However, only authority of position has the backing of formal sanctions. It follows that whoever wields personal influence and power can legitimize this only by gaining a formal position in the hierarchy, with commensurate authority.&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt; Leadership can be defined as one's ability to get others to willingly follow. Every organization needs leaders at every level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hakala|first1=David|title=The Top 10 Leadership Qualities|url=http://www.hrworld.com/features/top-10-leadership-qualities-031908|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410090435/http://www.hrworld.com/features/top-10-leadership-qualities-031908|archivedate=2013-04-10|website=HR World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management===
Over the years the philosophical terminology of "[[management]]" and "leadership" have, in the organizational context, been used both as synonyms and with clearly differentiated meanings. Debate is fairly common about whether the use of these terms should be restricted, and generally reflects an awareness of the distinction made by Burns (1978) between "transactional" leadership (characterized by emphasis on procedures, contingent reward, management by exception) and "transformational" leadership (characterized by charisma, personal relationships, creativity).&lt;ref name="Burns"/&gt;

===Group===
In contrast to individual leadership, some organizations have adopted group leadership. In this so-called [[shared leadership]], more than one person provides direction to the group as a whole. It is furthermore characterized by shared responsibility, cooperation and mutual influence among the team members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CARSON|first=J. B.|last2=TESLUK|first2=P. E.|last3=MARRONE|first3=J. A.|title=SHARED LEADERSHIP IN TEAMS: AN INVESTIGATION OF ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS AND PERFORMANCE.|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=50|issue=5|pages=1217–1234|doi=10.2307/20159921|jstor=20159921|year=2007}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organizations have taken this approach in hopes of increasing creativity, reducing costs, or downsizing. Others may see the traditional leadership of a [[wikt:boss|boss]] as costing too much in team performance. In some situations, the team members best able to handle any given phase of the project become the temporary leaders. Additionally, as each team member has the opportunity to experience the elevated level of empowerment, it energizes staff and feeds the cycle of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ingrid Bens|year=2006|title=Facilitating to Lead|publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0-7879-7731-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders who demonstrate persistence, tenacity, determination, and synergistic communication skills will bring out the same qualities in their groups. Good leaders use their own inner [[Mentorship|mentors]] to energize their team and organizations and lead a team to achieve success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Bart Barthelemy|year=1997|title=The Sky Is Not The Limit – Breakthrough Leadership|publisher=St. Lucie Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''According to the National School Boards Association (USA):'''''&lt;ref&gt;National School Boards Association&lt;/ref&gt;

These Group Leaderships or Leadership Teams have specific characteristics:

'''Characteristics of a Team'''
* There must be an awareness of unity on the part of all its members.
* There must be interpersonal relationship. Members must have a chance to contribute, and learn from and work with others.
* The members must have the ability to act together toward a common goal.

'''Ten characteristics of well-functioning teams:'''
* Purpose: Members proudly share a sense of why the team exists and are invested in accomplishing its mission and goals.
* Priorities: Members know what needs to be done next, by whom, and by when to achieve team goals.
* Roles: Members know their roles in getting tasks done and when to allow a more skillful member to do a certain task.
* Decisions: Authority and decision-making lines are clearly understood.
* Conflict: Conflict is dealt with openly and is considered important to decision-making and personal growth.
* Personal traits: members feel their unique personalities are appreciated and well utilized.
* Norms: Group norms for working together are set and seen as standards for every one in the groups.
* Effectiveness: Members find team meetings efficient and productive and look forward to this time together.
* Success: Members know clearly when the team has met with success and share in this equally and proudly.
* Training: Opportunities for feedback and updating skills are provided and taken advantage of by team members.

===Self-leadership===
[[Communication and Leadership During Change|Self-leadership]] is a process that occurs within an individual, rather than an external act. It is an expression of who we are as people.&lt;ref&gt;Hackman, M. &amp; Johnson, C. (2009). ''Leadership: A communication perspective''. Long Grove, Illinois: Waveland Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology and Evolution of Leadership===
[[Mark van Vugt]] and [[Anjana Ahuja]] in ''Naturally Selected: The Evolutionary Science of Leadership'' (2011) present evidence of leadership in non-human animals, from ants and bees to baboons and chimpanzees. They suggest that leadership has a long evolutionary history and that the same mechanisms underpinning leadership in humans appear in other social species, too.&lt;ref&gt;van Vugt, M., &amp; Ahuja, A. (2011). ''Naturally Selected: the Evolutionary Science of Leadership''. HarperBusiness.&lt;/ref&gt; They also suggest that the evolutionary origins of leadership are different from that of dominance. In a study [[Mark van Vugt]] and his team looked at the relation between basal testosterone and leadership versus dominance. They found that testosterone correlates with dominance but not with leadership. This was replicated in a sample of managers in which there was no relation between hierarchical position and testosterone level.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Meij, L., Schaveling, J., &amp; van Vugt, M. (2016). Basal testosterone, leadership and dominance: A field study and meta-analysis. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 72, 72-79.&lt;/ref&gt;.     
[[Richard Wrangham]] and [[Dale Peterson]], in ''[[Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence]]'' (1996), present evidence that only humans and [[chimpanzee]]s, among all the animals living on Earth, share a similar tendency for a cluster of behaviors: violence, [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], and competition for uniting behind the one chief male of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wrangham and Dale Peterson (1996). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/demonicmales.htm ''Demonic Males. Apes and the Origins of Human Violence'']. Mariner Books&lt;/ref&gt; This position is contentious. Many animals apart from apes are territorial, compete, exhibit violence, and have a social structure controlled by a dominant male (lions, wolves, etc.), suggesting Wrangham and Peterson's evidence is not empirical. However, we must examine other species as well, including elephants (which are matriarchal and follow an alpha female), meerkats (which are likewise matriarchal), sheep (which follow castrated bell[[wether (disambiguation)|wethers]]) and many others.

By comparison, [[bonobo]]s, the second-closest species-relatives of humans, do ''not'' unite behind the chief male of the land. The bonobos show deference to an alpha or top-ranking female that, with the support of her coalition of other females, can prove as strong as the strongest male. Thus, if leadership amounts to getting the greatest number of followers, then among the bonobos, a female almost always exerts the strongest and most effective leadership. (Incidentally, not all scientists agree on the allegedly peaceful nature of the bonobo or with its reputation as a "[[hippie]] chimp".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths==
Leadership, although largely talked about, has been described as one of the least understood concepts across all cultures and civilizations. Over the years, many researchers have stressed the prevalence of this misunderstanding, stating that the existence of several flawed assumptions, or myths, concerning leadership often interferes with individuals' conception of what leadership is all about (Gardner, 1965; Bennis, 1975).&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, J. W. (1965). ''Self-Renewal: The Individual and the Innovative Society.'' New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennis, W. G. (1975). ''Where have all the leaders gone?'' Washington, D.C.: Federal Executive Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership is innate===
According to some, leadership is determined by distinctive [[dispositional affect|dispositional characteristics]] present at birth (e.g., [[extraversion and introversion|extraversion]]; [[intelligence]]; [[ingenuity]]). However, according to Forsyth (2009) there is evidence to show that leadership also develops through hard work and careful observation.&lt;ref name=Forsyth&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2009). ''Group dynamics'' (5th ed.). Pacific Grove, California: Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, effective leadership can result from [[nature versus nurture|nature]] (i.e., innate talents) as well as [[nature versus nurture|nurture]] (i.e., acquired skills).

===Leadership is possessing power over others===
Although leadership is certainly a form of [[Power (social and political)|power]], it is not demarcated by power ''over'' people – rather, it is a power ''with'' people that exists as a reciprocal relationship between a leader and his/her followers (Forsyth, 2009).&lt;ref name=Forsyth/&gt; Despite popular belief, the use of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]], [[coercion]], and domination to influence others is not a requirement for leadership. In actuality, individuals who seek group consent and strive to act in the best interests of others can also become effective leaders (e.g., class president; court judge).

===Leaders are positively influential===
The [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the assertion that groups flourish when guided by effective leaders can be illustrated using several examples. For instance, according to Baumeister et al. (1988), the [[bystander effect]] (failure to respond or offer assistance) that tends to develop within groups faced with an emergency is significantly reduced in groups guided by a leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. F. | last2 = Senders | first2 = P. S. | last3 = Chesner | first3 = S. C. | last4 = Tice | first4 = D. M. | year = 1988 | title = Who's in charge here?

However, the difference leaders make is '''not''' always positive in nature. Leaders sometimes focus on fulfilling their own agendas at the expense of others, including his/her own followers (e.g., [[Pol Pot]]; [[Joseph Stalin|Josef Stalin]]). Leaders who focus on personal gain by employing stringent and manipulative leadership styles often make a difference, but usually do so through negative means.&lt;ref&gt;Lipman-Blumen, J. (2005) ''The Allure of Toxic Leaders''. New York: Oxford. University Press Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaders entirely control group outcomes===
In [[Western culture]]s it is generally assumed that group leaders make ''all'' the difference when it comes to group influence and overall goal-attainment. Although common, this romanticized view of leadership (i.e., the tendency to overestimate the degree of control leaders have over their groups and their groups' outcomes) ignores the existence of many other factors that influence group dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meindl | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Ehrlich | first2 = S. B. | last3 = Dukerich | first3 = J. M. | year = 1985 | title = The romance of leadership | url = | journal = Administrative Science Quarterly | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 78–102 | doi=10.2307/2392813| jstor = 2392813 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[group cohesiveness|group cohesion]], [[organizational communication|communication patterns]] among members, individual personality traits, group context, the nature or orientation of the work, as well as [[norm (social)|behavioral norms]] and established standards influence group functionality in varying capacities. For this reason, it is unwarranted to assume that all leaders are in complete control of their groups' achievements.

===All groups have a designated leader===

Despite preconceived notions, not all groups need have a designated leader. Groups that are primarily composed of women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmid Mast | first1 = M | year = 2002 | title = Female dominance hierarchies: Are they any different from males'? | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 29–39 | doi=10.1177/0146167202281003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berdahl | first1 = J.

J. | year = 2007 | title = Nonlinear dynamics and leadership emergence | url = https://epublications.marquette.edu/psych_fac/220| journal = Leadership Quarterly | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 357–369 | doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2007.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; or only exist for a short period of time (e.g., student work groups; pub quiz/trivia teams) often undergo a [[diffusion of responsibility]], where leadership tasks and roles are shared amongst members (Schmid Mast, 2002; Berdahl &amp; Anderson, 2007; Guastello, 2007).

===Group members resist leaders===
Although research has indicated that group members' dependence on group leaders can lead to reduced self-reliance and overall group strength,&lt;ref name=Forsyth/&gt; most people actually prefer to be led than to be without a leader (Berkowitz, 1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berkowitz | first1 = L | year = 1953 | title = Sharing leadership in small, decision-making groups | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = 2| pages = 231–238 | doi=10.1037/h0058076}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "need for a leader" becomes especially strong in troubled groups that are experiencing some sort of conflict. Group members tend to be more contented and productive when they have a leader to guide them. Although individuals filling leadership roles can be a direct source of resentment for followers, most people appreciate the contributions that leaders make to their groups and consequently welcome the guidance of a leader (Stewart &amp; Manz, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stewart | first1 = G. L. | last2 = Manz | first2 = C. C. | year = 1995 | title = Leadership for self-managing work teams: A typology and integrative model | url = | journal = Human Relations | volume = 48 | issue = 7| pages = 747–770 | doi=10.1177/001872679504800702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action-oriented environments==
In most cases, these teams are tasked to operate in remote and changeable environments with limited support or backup (action environments). Leadership of people in these environments requires a different set of skills to that of front line management. These leaders must effectively operate remotely and negotiate the needs of the individual, team, and task within a changeable environment. This has been termed action oriented leadership. Some examples of demonstrations of action oriented leadership include extinguishing a rural fire, locating a missing person, leading a team on an outdoor expedition, or rescuing a person from a potentially hazardous environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schelten|first1=Andreas|title=Prof.|url=http://www.bpaed.edu.tum.de/fileadmin/tueds02/www/pdfs/publikationen/riedl/2002handoutvariantsriedl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include modern technology deployments of small/medium-sized IT teams into client plant sites. Leadership of these teams requires hands on experience and a lead-by-example attitude to empower team members to make well thought out and concise decisions independent of executive management and/or home base decision makers. Zachary Hansen was an early adopter of Scrum/Kanban branch development methodologies during the mid 90's to alleviate the dependency that field teams had on trunk based development. This method of just-in-time action oriented development and deployment allowed remote plant sites to deploy up-to-date software patches frequently and without dependency on core team deployment schedules satisfying the clients need to rapidly patch production environment bugs as needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boehm|first1=B.W.|title=Software risk management: principles and practices|journal=IEEE Software|volume=8|pages=32–41|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=62930&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D62930|doi=10.1109/52.62930|year=1991|citeseerx=10.1.1.381.466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical thought==

[[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]]'s 1840 "[[Great Man theory]]", which emphasized the role of leading individuals, met opposition in the 19th and 20th centuries.

[[Karl Popper]] noted in 1945 that leaders can [[mislead]] and make mistakes - he warns against deferring to "great men".&lt;ref&gt;

have subjected the concept of leadership to [[critical thinking]] and have provided an analysis that asserts that people abrogate their responsibility to think and will actions for themselves. While the conventional view of leadership may satisfy people who "want to be told what to do", these critics say that one should question why they are being subjected to a will or intellect other than their own if the leader is not a subject-matter expert ([[Subject Matter Expert|SME]]).

Concepts such as [[Workers' self-management|autogestion]], [[employeeship]], and common [[civic virtue]], etc., challenge the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the leadership principle by stressing [[individual responsibility]] and/or group authority in the workplace and elsewhere and by focusing on the skills and attitudes that a person needs in general rather than separating out "leadership" as the basis of a special class of individuals.

Similarly, various historical calamities (such as [[World War II]]) can be attributed&lt;ref&gt;
For example:

to a misplaced reliance on the [[Führerprinzip|principle of leadership]] as exhibited in [[dictatorship]].

The idea of [[leaderism]] paints leadership and its excesses in a negative light.

==Executives==
Executives are energetic, outgoing, and competitive. They can be visionary, hard-working, and decisive. However, managers need to be aware of unsuccessful executives who once showed management potential but who are later dismissed or retired early. They typically fail because of personality factors rather than job performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sperry|first=Len|date=September 1997|title=Leadership Dynamics Character and Character Structure in Executives|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232551186|journal=Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|series=268–284|volume=49|issue=4|pages=|via=}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lighting ratio''' in [[photography]] refers to the comparison of [[key light]] (the main source of light from which shadows fall) to the  [[fill light]] (the light that fills in the shadow areas). The higher the lighting ratio, the higher the contrast of the image; the lower the ratio, the lower the contrast. Since the lighting ratio is the ratio of the light levels on the brightest lit to the least lit parts of the subject, and the brightest lit are lit by both key (K) and fill (F), therefore the lighting ratio is properly (K+F):F although for contrast ratios of 4:1 or more, then K:F is sufficiently accurate.

Light can be measured in [[footcandles]]. A key light of 100 footcandles and a fill light of 100 footcandles have a 1:1 ratio (a ratio of one to one). A keylight of 800 footcandles and a fill light of 200 footcandles has a ratio of 4:1.

The ratio can be determined in relation to [[F stop]]s since each increase in f-stop is equal to double the amount of light: 2 to the power of the difference in f stops is equal to the first factor in the ratio. For example, a difference in two f-stops between key and fill is 2 squared, or 4:1 ratio. A difference in 3 stops is 2 cubed, or an 8:1 ratio. No difference is equal to 2 to the power of 0, for a 1:1 ratio.

In situations such as motion picture lighting sometimes the lighting ratio is described as key plus fill to fill alone. A [[light meter]] can automatically calculate the ratio of key plus fill to fill alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11629">[[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] can be identified according to the properties they have. These properties describe the functions behaviour under certain conditions. A parabola is a specific type of function.

==Relative to [[set theory]]==
These properties concern the [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]], the [[codomain]] and the [[Range (mathematics)|range]] of functions.
* [[Injective function]]: has a distinct value for each distinct argument. Also called an injection or, sometimes, one-to-one function.In other words, every element of the function's codomain is the image of at most one element of its domain.
* [[Surjective function]]: has a [[preimage]] for every element of the [[codomain]], i.e. the codomain equals the range. Also called a surjection or [[onto function]].
* [[Bijective function]]: is both an [[injective function|injection]] and a [[surjection]], and thus [[Inverse function|invertible]].
* [[Identity function]]: maps any given element to itself.
* [[Constant function]]: has a fixed value regardless of arguments.
* [[Empty function]]: whose domain equals the [[empty set]].
* [[Set function]]: whose input is a set.
* [[Choice function]] called also [[List of selection theorems|selector]] or [[Uniformization (set theory)|uniformizing function]]: assigns to each set one of its elements.

==Relative to an operator (c.q. a [[group theory|group]] or other [[Mathematical structure|structure]])==
These properties concern how the function is affected by [[arithmetic]] operations on its operand.

The following are special examples of a [[homomorphism]] on a [[binary operation]]:
* [[Additive map|Additive function]]: preserves the addition operation: ''f''(''x'' + ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') + ''f''(''y'').
* [[Multiplicative function]]: preserves the multiplication operation: ''f''(''xy'') = ''f''(''x'')''f''(''y'').

Relative to [[negation]]:
* [[Even function]]: is symmetric with respect to the ''Y''-axis. Formally, for each ''x'': ''f''(''x'') = ''f''(&amp;minus;''x'').
* [[Odd function]]: is symmetric with respect to the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]. Formally, for each ''x'': ''f''(&amp;minus;''x'') = &amp;minus;''f''(''x'').

Relative to a binary operation and an [[order theory|order]]:
* [[Subadditive function]]: for which the value of ''f''(''x''+''y'') is less than or equal to ''f''(''x'') + ''f''(''y'').
* [[Superadditive function]]: for which the value of ''f''(''x''+''y'') is greater than or equal to ''f''(''x'') + ''f''(''y'').

==Relative to a topology==
* [[Continuous function]]: in which [[preimage]]s of [[open set]]s are open.
* [[Nowhere continuous]] function: is not continuous at any point of its domain (e.g. [[Dirichlet function]]).
* [[Homeomorphism]]: is an [[injective function]] that is also [[continuous function|continuous]], whose [[inverse function|inverse]] is continuous.
* [[Open function]]: maps open sets to open sets.
* [[Closed function]]: maps closed sets to closed sets.
* [[Support (mathematics)#Compact support|Compactly supported function]]: vanishes outside a compact set.
* [[Cadlag function]], called also RCLL function, corlor function, etc: right-continuous, with left limits.
* [[Quasi-continuous function]]: roughly, close to ''f''(''x'') for some but not all ''y'' near ''x'' (rather technical). 

Relative to topology and order:
* [[Semicontinuous function]]: upper or lower semicontinuous.
* [[Continuous_function#Directional_and_semi-continuity|Right-continuous function]]: no jump when the limit point is approached from the right. Left-continuous function: similarly.
* [[Locally bounded]] function: bounded around every point.

==Relative to an ordering==
* [[Monotonic function]]: does not reverse ordering of any pair.
* Strict [[Monotonic function]]: preserves the given order.

==Relative to the real/complex numbers==
* [[Linear function]]; also [[affine function]].
* [[Convex function]]: line segment between any two points on the graph lies above the graph. Also [[concave function]].
* [[Arithmetic function]]: A function from the positive [[integers]] into the [[complex number]]s.
* [[Analytic function]]: Can be defined locally by a [[Convergent series|convergent]] [[power series]].
* [[Quasi-analytic function]]: not analytic, but still, locally determined by its derivatives at a point.
* [[Differentiable function]]: Has a [[derivative]].
* [[Continuously differentiable function]]: differentiable, with continuous derivative.
* [[Smooth function]]: Has derivatives of all orders.
* [[Lipschitz function]], [[Holder function]]: somewhat more than [[uniformly continuous function]].
* [[Holomorphic function]]: [[Complex number|Complex]] valued function of a complex variable which is differentiable at every point in its domain.
* [[Meromorphic function]]: [[Complex number|Complex]] valued function that is holomorphic everywhere, apart from at isolated points where there are [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]].
* [[Entire function]]: A [[holomorphic function]] whose domain is the entire [[complex number|complex plane]].
* [[Harmonic function]]: its value at the center of a ball is equal to the average value on the surface of the ball [[Harmonic function#The mean value property|(mean value property)]]. Also [[subharmonic function]] and [[superharmonic function]].
* [[Elementary function]]: composition of arithmetic operations, exponentials, logarithms, constants, and solutions of algebraic equations.
* [[Special functions]]: non-elementary functions that have established names and notations due to their importance.
* [[Trigonometric functions]]: relate the angles of a triangle to the lengths of its sides.
* [[Nowhere differentiable function]] called also [[Weierstrass function]]: continuous everywhere but not differentiable even at a single point.
* [[Fast-growing hierarchy|Fast-growing]] (or rapidly increasing) function; in particular, [[Ackermann function]].

==Relative to measurability==
* [[Measurable function]]: the preimage of each measurable set is measurable.
* [[Borel function]]: the preimage of each [[Borel set]] is a Borel set.
* [[Baire function]] called also [[Baire measurable function]]: obtained from continuous functions by transfinite iteration of the operation of forming pointwise limits of sequences of functions.
* [[Singular function]]: continuous, with zero derivative [[almost everywhere]], but non-constant.

==Relative to measure==
* [[Integrable function]]: has an integral (finite).
* [[Square-integrable function]]: the square of its absolute value is integrable.

Relative to measure and topology

* [[Locally integrable function]]: integrable around every point.

==Ways of defining functions/relation to type theory==
* [[Polynomial#Polynomial functions|Polynomial function]]: defined by evaluating a polynomial.
* [[Rational function]]: ratio of two polynomial functions. In particular, [[Möbius transformation]] called also [[Linear fractional transformation|linear fractional]] function.
* [[Algebraic function]]: defined as the root of a polynomial equation.
* [[Transcendental function]]: analytic but not algebraic. Also [[hypertranscendental function]].
* [[Composite function]]: is formed by the composition of two functions ''f'' and ''g'', by mapping ''x'' to ''f''(''g''(''x'')).
* [[Inverse function]]: is declared by "doing the reverse" of a given function (e.g. [[arcsine]] is the inverse of [[sine]]).
* [[Implicit function]]: defined implicitly by a relation between the argument(s) and the value.
* [[Piecewise function]]: is defined by different expressions at different intervals.
* [[Computable function]]: an algorithm can do the job of the function. Also [[semicomputable function]]; [[primitive recursive function]]; [[partial recursive function]].

In general, functions are often defined by specifying the name of a dependent variable, and a way of calculating what it should map to.  For this purpose, the &lt;math&gt;\mapsto&lt;/math&gt; symbol or [[Alonzo Church|Church]]'s [[lambda calculus|&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;]] is often used.  Also, sometimes mathematicians notate a function's [[domain of a function|domain]] and [[codomain]] by writing e.g. &lt;math&gt;f:A\rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;.  These notions extend directly to [[lambda calculus]] and [[type theory]], respectively.

==Higher order functions==
These are functions that operate on functions or produce other functions, see [[Higher order function]].
Examples are:
* [[Function composition]].

* [[Integral]] and [[Differential (mathematics)|Differential]] operations.
* [[Fourier transforms]].
* [[Fold (higher-order function)|Fold]] and [[Map (higher-order function)|Map]] operations.
* [[Currying]]

==Relation to category theory==

[[Category theory]] is a branch of mathematics that formalizes the notion of a special function via arrows or [[morphisms]].  A [[category (mathematics)|category]] is an algebraic object that (abstractly) consists of a class of ''objects'', and for every pair of objects, a set of ''morphisms''.  A partial (equiv. [[dependently typed]]) binary operation called [[Function composition|composition]] is provided on morphisms, every object has one special morphism from it to itself called the [[identity (mathematics)|identity]] on that object, and composition and identities are required to obey certain relations.

In a so-called [[concrete category]], the objects are associated with mathematical structures like [[set (mathematics)|sets]], [[magmas]], [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[topological spaces]], [[vector spaces]], [[metric spaces]], [[order theory|partial orders]], [[differentiable manifolds]], [[uniform spaces]], etc., and morphisms between two objects are associated with ''structure-preserving functions'' between them.  In the examples above, these would be [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], magma [[homomorphisms]], [[group homomorphisms]], ring homomorphisms, [[continuous functions]], [[linear transformations]] (or [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]), [[metric map]]s, [[monotonic function]]s, [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] functions, and [[uniformly continuous]] functions, respectively.

As an algebraic theory, one of the advantages of category theory is to enable one to prove many general results with a minimum of assumptions.  Many common notions from mathematics (e.g. [[surjective]], [[injective]], [[free object]], [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]], finite [[Group representation|representation]], [[isomorphism]]) are definable purely in category theoretic terms (cf. [[monomorphism]], [[epimorphism]]).

Category theory has been suggested as a foundation for mathematics on par with [[set theory]] and [[type theory]] (cf. [[topos]]).

[[Allegory (category theory)|Allegory theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter Freyd, Andre Scedrov (1990). Categories, Allegories. Mathematical Library Vol 39. North-Holland. {{isbn|978-0-444-70368-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; provides a generalization comparable to category theory for [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] instead of functions.

==More general objects still called functions==
* [[Dirac delta function]]: useful to describe physical phenomena such as point charges.
* [[Generalized function]]: a wide generalization of Dirac delta function, able to describe [[white noise]] etc.
* [[Multivalued function]]: one-to-many relation.
* [[Random function]]: [[Random element]] of a set of functions.

'''Marta Minujín''' (born 1943) is an Argentine [[conceptual art|conceptual]] and [[performance art]]ist.

==Life and work==
[[File:Marta Minujín signature.png|thumb|right|200px|Signature.]]
[[File:Marta Minujín en La Menesunda.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Minujín inside ''La Menesunda'', a 1965 exhibition.]]

Marta Minujín was born in the [[San Telmo]] neighborhood of [[Buenos Aires]]. She met a young economist, Juan Carlos Gómez Sabaini, and married him in secret in 1959; the couple had two children. As a student in the [[National University Art Institute]], she first exhibited her work in a 1959 show at the Teatro Agón. A scholarship from the [[w:es:Fondo nacional de las Artes|National Arts Foundation]] allowed her to travel to [[Paris]] as one of the young Argentine artists featured in ''[[Pablo Curatella Manes]] and Thirty Argentines of the New Generation'', a 1960 exhibit organized by the prominent sculptor and [[Paris Biennale]] judge.&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/07/06/conexiones/t-1008529.htm ''Clarín'': 'Superé todos mis problemas, como Maradona' (7/6/2005) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her time in Paris inspired her to create "livable sculptures," notably ''La Destrucción'', in which she assembled mattresses along the [[15th arrondissement of Paris|Impasse Roussin]], only to invite other avant-garde artists in her entourage, including [[Christo]] and Paul-Armand Gette, to destroy the display. This 1963 creation would be the first of her "[[Happening]]s"{{spaced ndash}}events as works of arts in themselves; among her hosts during her stay was Finance Minister [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] (later President of [[France]]).&lt;ref name=pagina12&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/las12/13-639-2003-05-25.html ''Página/12'': Pop-ular (5/25/2003) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

She earned a National Award in 1964 at Buenos Aires' [[Torcuato di Tella Institute]], where she prepared two happenings: ''Eróticos en technicolor'' and the interactive ''Revuélquese y viva'' (''Roll Around in Bed and Live''). Her ''Cabalgata'' (''Cavalcade'') aired on [[Canal 7 Argentina|Public Television]] that year, and involved horses with paint buckets tied to their tails. These displays took her to nearby [[Montevideo]], where she organized ''Sucesos'' (''Events'') at the [[Uruguay]]an capital's [[Estadio Luis Tróccoli|Tróccoli Stadium]] with 500 chickens, artists of contrasting physical shape, motorcycles, and other elements.&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;

She joined Rubén Santantonín at the di Tella Institute in 1965 to create ''La Menesunda'' (''Mayhem''), where participants were asked to go through sixteen chambers, each separated by a human-shaped entry. Led by [[neon]] lights, groups of eight visitors would encounter rooms with television sets at full blast, couples making love in bed, a cosmetics counter (complete with an attendant), a dental office from which dialing an oversized rotary phone was required to leave, a walk-in freezer with dangling fabrics (suggesting sides of beef), and a mirrored room with [[black light]]ing, falling confetti, and the scent of frying food. The use of advertising throughout suggested the influence of [[pop art]] in Minujín's "mayhem."&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;

These works earned her a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1966, by which she relocated to [[New York City]]. The ''[[coup d'état]]'' by General [[Juan Carlos Onganía]] in June of that year made her fellowship all the more fortuitous, as the new regime would frequently censor and ban irreverent displays such as hers. Minujín delved into [[psychedelic art]] in New York, of which among her best-known creations was that of the "Minuphone," where patrons could enter a telephone booth, dial a number, and be surprised by colors projecting from the glass panels, sounds, and seeing themselves on a television screen in the floor.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899583,00.html ''Time'' (July 7, 1967). Sculpture: The Number is 581-4570, but Don't Call It]&lt;/ref&gt; The Minuphone was designed and constructed, in collaboration with her, by engineer Per Biorn, who was employed at Bell Telephone Laboratories, and the work was shown at the Howard Wise Gallery in New York City.&lt;ref&gt; Biorn Biography [http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=581]&lt;/ref&gt; She was on hand in 1971 for the Buenos Aires premiere of ''Operación Perfume'', and in New York, befriended fellow conceptual artist [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;

She returned to Argentina in 1976, and afterwards created a series of reproductions of [[classical Greek sculpture]]s in [[plaster of paris]], as well as miniatures of the [[Obelisk of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires Obelisk]] carved out of [[panettone]], of the [[Venus de Milo]] carved from cheese, and of [[Tango (music)|Tango]] vocalist [[Carlos Gardel]] for a 1981 display in [[Medellín]]. The latter, a [[sheet metal]] creation, was stuffed with cotton and lit, creating a metaphor for the legendary crooner's untimely 1935 death in a Medellín plane crash.&lt;ref name=pagina12/&gt; She was awarded the first of a series of [[Konex Award]]s, the highest in the Argentine cultural realm, in 1982.&lt;ref name=konex&gt;[http://www.fundacionkonex.com.ar/premios/curriculum.asp?id=741 Fundación Konex: Marta Minujín {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Argentine general election, 1983|return of democracy in 1983]], following seven years of a generally failed dictatorship, prompted Minujín to create a monument to a glaring, inanimate victim of the regime: [[freedom of expression]]. Assembling 30,000 [[censorship|banned books]] (including works as diverse as those by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Raúl Scalabrini Ortiz]], and [[Darcy Ribeiro]], as well as satires such as ''[[Absalom and Achitophel]]'', reference volumes such as ''[[Enciclopedia Salvat]]'', and even children's texts, notably ''[[The Little Prince]]'' by [[Antoine de Saint Exupéry]]), she designed the "Parthenon of Books," and following President [[Raúl Alfonsín]]'s December 10 inaugural, had it mounted on a boulevard median along the [[Nueve de Julio Avenue|Ninth of July Avenue]]. Dismantled after three weeks, its mass of newly unbanned titles was distributed to the public below.&lt;ref name=pagina12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=986759 ''La Nación'': Política y concepto {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

A conversation with Warhol in New York regarding the [[Latin American debt crisis]] inspired one of her most publicized "happenings:" ''The Debt''. Purchasing a shipment of [[maize]], Minujín dramatized the Argentine cost of servicing the foreign debt with a 1985 photo series in which she symbolically handed the maize to Warhol "in payment" for the debt; she never again saw Warhol, who died in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/imprimir/diario/suplementos/radar/9-2323-2005-06-20.html ''Página/12'': Andy y yo (6/19/2005) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Minujín has continued to display her art pieces and happenings in the [[Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Buenos Aires)|National Fine Arts Museum]], the [[ArteBA]] contemporary art festival Buenos Aires, the [[Barbican Center]], and a vast number of other international galleries and art shows, while continuing to satirize [[consumer culture]] (particularly relating to women).&lt;ref name=konex/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/16929/arteba/ ArteBA {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; She is well known for her belief that ''"everything is art."'' &lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;

Object segments are depicted by the red edge.]]

In [[computer vision]], '''object co-segmentation''' is a special case of [[image segmentation]], which is defined as jointly segmenting semantically similar objects in multiple images or video frames&lt;ref name="Vicente Rother Kolmogorov 2011 p. "/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chen Chen Chang 2012 p. "/&gt;.

== Challenges ==

It is often challenging to extract segmentation masks of a target/object from a noisy collection of images or video frames, which involves [[Object detection|object discovery]] coupled with [[Image segmentation|segmentation]]. A '''noisy collection''' implies that the object/target is present sporadically in a set of images or the object/target disappears intermittently throughout the video of interest.

== Dynamic Markov Networks-based Methods ==
[[File:The inference process of the two coupled dynamic Markov networks to obtain the joint video object discovery and segmentation.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|The inference process of the two coupled dynamic Markov networks to obtain the joint video object discovery and segmentation&lt;ref name="Liu Wang Hua Zhang 2018 pp. 5840–5853"/&gt;]][[File:Framework of Joint Video Object Discovery and Segmentation.png|thumb|upright=1.5|A joint object discover and co-segmentation framework based on coupled dynamic Markov Networks&lt;ref name="Liu Wang Hua Zhang 2018 pp. 5840–5853"/&gt;]] 
A joint object discover and co-segmentation method based on coupled dynamic [[Markov random field|Markov Networks]] has been proposed recently&lt;ref name="Liu Wang Hua Zhang 2018 pp. 5840–5853"/&gt;, which claims significant improvements in robustness against irrelevant/noisy video frames.

== [[Convolutional neural network|CNN]] and [[Long short-term memory|LSTM]]-based Methods ==
[[File:Overview of the coarse-to-fine temporal action localization.png|thumb|left|upright=2.0|Overview of the coarse-to-fine temporal action localization in &lt;ref name="Wang Duan Zhang Niu p=1657"/&gt;. (a) Coarse localization. Given an untrimmed video, we first generate saliency-aware video clips via variable-length sliding windows. The proposal network decides whether a video clip contains any actions (so the clip is added to the candidate set) or pure background (so the clip is directly discarded). The subsequent classification network predicts the specific action class for each candidate clip and outputs the classification scores and action labels. (b) Fine localization. With the classification scores and action labels from prior coarse localization, further prediction of the video category is carried out and its starting and ending frames are obtained.]][[File:Flowchart of the spatio-temporal action localization detector Segment-tube.png|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Flowchart of the spatio-temporal action localization detector Segment-tube&lt;ref name="Wang Duan Zhang Niu p=1657"/&gt;. As the input, an untrimmed video contains multiple frames of actions (&lt;span&gt;''e.g.''&lt;/span&gt;, all actions in a pair figure skating video), with only a portion of these frames belonging to a relevant category (&lt;span&gt;''e.g.''&lt;/span&gt;, the DeathSpirals). There are usually irrelevant preceding and subsequent actions (background). The Segment-tube detector alternates the optimization of temporal localization and spatial segmentation iteratively. The final output is a sequence of per-frame segmentation masks with precise starting/ending frames denoted with the red chunk at the bottom, while the background are marked with green chunks at the bottom.]]

In [[Activity recognition|action localization]] applications, ''object co-segmentation'' is also implemented as the '''Segment-Tube''' spatio-temporal detector&lt;ref name="Wang Duan Zhang Niu p=1657"/&gt;. Inspired by the recent spatio-temporal action localization efforts with tubelets (sequences of bounding boxes), Le &lt;span&gt;''et al.''&lt;/span&gt; present a new spatio-temporal action localization detector Segment-tube, which consists of sequences of per-frame segmentation masks. This Segment-tube detector can temporally pinpoint the starting/ending frame of each action category in the presence of preceding/subsequent interference actions in untrimmed videos. Simultaneously, the Segment-tube detector produces per-frame segmentation masks instead of bounding boxes, offering superior spatial accuracy to tubelets. This is achieved by alternating iterative optimization between temporal action localization and spatial action segmentation.


The proposed Segment-tube detector is illustrated in the flowchart on the right. The sample input is an untrimmed video containing all frames in a pair figure skating video, with only a portion of these frames belonging to a relevant category (e.g., the DeathSpirals). Initialized with saliency based image segmentation on individual frames, this method first performs temporal action localization step with a cascaded 3D [[Convolutional neural network|CNN]] and [[Long short-term memory|LSTM]], and pinpoints the starting frame and the ending frame of a target action with a coarse-to-fine strategy. Subsequently, the Segment-tube detector refines per-frame spatial segmentation with [[Graph cuts in computer vision|graph cut]] by focusing on relevant frames identified by the temporal action localization step. The optimization alternates between the temporal action localization and spatial action segmentation in an iterative manner. Upon practical convergence, the final spatio-temporal action localization results are obtained in the format of a sequence of per-frame segmentation masks (bottom row in the flowchart) with precise starting/ending frames.

[[Charles Darwin]] first recognized this phenomenon, though the term was later coined by Huber in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huber|first=B|date=1939|title=Siebrohrensystem unserer Baume und seine jahreszeitlichen Veranderungen.|url=|journal=Jahrbücher für Wissenschaftliche Botanik|volume=88|pages=176–242|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin explained the idea of phylogenetic inertia based on his observations; he spoke about it when explaining the "Law of Conditions of Existence".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Darwin also suggested that, after [[speciation]], the [[organism]]s do not start over from scratch, but have characteristics that are built upon already existing ones that were inherited from their ancestors; and these characteristics likely limit the amount of evolution seen in that new [[Taxon|taxa]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shanahan|first=Timothy|date=2011|title=Phylogenetic Inertia and Darwin's Higher Law|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49816525_Phylogenetic_Inertia_and_Darwin%27s_Higher_Law|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the main concept of phylogenetic inertia.

[[Richard Dawkins]] also explained these constraints by likening [[natural selection]] to a river in his 1982 book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Extended Phenotype: The Gene as a Unit of Selection|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of phylogenetic inertia ==

=== Body plan ===

*[[File:Fishapod evolution.jpg|alt=Sown here is a cladogram of the best known transitional fossils. From bottom to top: Eusthenopteron, Panderichthys, Tiktaalik, Acanthostega, Ichthyostega, Pederpes.|thumb|229x229px|Evolution of fish to tetrapods.  The basic body plan has been phylogenetically constrained.]]Most terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s have a [[body plan]] that consist of four limbs. The phylogenetic inertia hypothesis suggests that this body plan is observed, not because it happens to be optimal, but because [[Evolution of tetrapods|tetrapods]] are derived from a [[clade]] of [[fish]]es ([[Sarcopterygii]]) which also have four limbs. Four limbs happened to be suitable means of locomotion, and so this body plan has not been selected against.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewin|first=Roger|date=1980|title=Evolutionary Theory Under Fire|url=|journal=Science|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Human]]s do not have optimal structure for [[bipedalism]], because much of the human body plan originally evolved under [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] locomotion, and has since been constrained because of phylogenetic inertia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gould|first=S.

=== Modes of reproduction ===

[[Bird]]s are the only speciose group of vertebrates that are exclusively [[Oviparity|oviparous]], or egg laying. It has been suggested that birds are phylogenetically constrained, as being derived from [[reptile]]s, and likely have not overcome this constraint or diverged far enough away to develop [[viviparity]], or live birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKitrick|first=Mary|date=1993|title=Phylogenetic Constraint in Evolutionary Theory: Has it any Explanatory Power?|url=|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.24.110193.001515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blackburn|first=Daniel|last2=Evans|first2=Howard|date=1986|title=Why are there no Viviparous Birds?|url=|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=128|issue=2|doi=10.1086/284552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homologous structures ===

* More specifically than the similarity in body plan, there are [[homology (biology)|homologous]] bones across [[mammal]]ian taxa. For example, the [[pentadactyl limb]] bone structure observed in the arms of [[primate]]s, front legs of equestrians, in the wings of [[bat]]s, and the flippers of [[Seal (animal)|seals]]. The fact that they are homologous is further evidence for phylogenetic inertia; these structures have been modified over time, but they are constrained by common ancestry.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Origin of Species|last=Darwin|first=Charles|publisher=|year=1859|isbn=|location=|pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* All vertebrates share a homologous eye structure that effectively have a [[Blind spot (vision)|blind spot]] in them where the [[optic nerve]] attaches to the [[retina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Blind Watchmaker|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=|year=1986|isbn=0-393-31570-3|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tests for phylogenetic inertia in study systems ==
There have been several studies that have been able to effectively test for phylogenetic inertia when looking into shared traits; predominantly with a comparative methods approach.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diniz-Filho|first=Jose Alexandre Felizola|last2=Sant'Ana|first2=Carlos Eduardo Ramos de|last3=Bini|first3=Luis Mauricio|date=1998-01-01|title=An Eigenvector Method for Estimating Phylogenetic Inertia|jstor=2411294|journal=Evolution|volume=52|issue=5|pages=1247–1262|doi=10.2307/2411294}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pienaar|first=Jason|last2=Ilany|first2=Amiyaal|last3=Geffen|first3=Eli|last4=Yom-Tov|first4=Yoram|date=2013-05-01|title=Macroevolution of life-history traits in passerine birds: adaptation and phylogenetic inertia|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12077/abstract|journal=Ecology Letters|volume=16|issue=5|pages=571–576|doi=10.1111/ele.12077|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morales|first=Eduardo|date=2000-04-01|title=Estimating Phylogenetic Inertia in Tithonia (asteraceae): A Comparative Approach|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00050.x/abstract|journal=Evolution||volume=54|issue=2|pages=475–484|doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00050.x|issn=1558-5646}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have used comparative methods and found evidence for certain traits attributed to adaptation, and some to phylogeny; there were also numerous traits that could be attributed to both.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another study developed a new method of comparative examination that showed to be a powerful predictor of phylogenetic inertia in a variety of situations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24713">The '''problem of mental causation''' is a conceptual issue in the [[philosophy of mind]]. That problem, in short, is how to account for the common-sense idea that intentional thoughts or [[intentional mental states]] are causes of intentional actions. The problem divides into several distinct sub-problems, including the problem of causal exclusion, the problem of anomalism, and the problem of externalism. However, the sub-problem which has attracted most attention in the philosophical literature is arguably the exclusion problem.

== Description ==

The basic problem of mental causation is an intuitive one: on the face of it, it seems that mental events cause physical events (and vice versa), but how can mental events have any causal effect on physical events? Suppose, for example, some person, John, orders dessert after dinner. It seems that at least one cause for such a physical, behavioral event is that John desired to have dessert and believed that by ordering dessert he would be able to soon have dessert. But, how can such mental events as beliefs and desires cause John's mouth to move in such a way that he orders dessert?

== Sub-problems of mental causation ==

=== Exclusion problem ===
What follows is a summary of the causal exclusion problem in its simplest form, and it is merely one of several possible formulations.

To the extent that we do ''not'' have to go outside human physiology in order to trace the causal antecedents of any bodily movement, intentional action can be fully causally explained by the existence of these physiological antecedents ''alone''. No mention of mental states need enter into the explanation. This troubles philosophers because intuitively it seems that mental states are crucial in causing a person to act (for example, their beliefs and desires). But, given that physiological facts are sufficient to account for action, mental states appear to be superfluous; they are at risk of being causally and explanatorily irrelevant with respect to human action {{harv|Yoo|2006|p=§3b.iii}}.

Many philosophers consider this apparent irrelevance to be a highly counter-intuitive and undesirable position to take. It ultimately leads to [[epiphenomenalism]]—the view that mental events or states are causally irrelevant, they are merely after effects that play no role in any causal chains whatsoever. Thomas Huxley famously noted that epiphenomenalism treats mental states like the steam coming off a train: it plays no causal role in the train's moving forward, it is merely an "emergent property" of the actual causation occurring in the engine {{harv|Walter|2003|p= §2}}.

=== Problem of anomalism ===
Another problem with mental causation is that mental events seem anomalous in the sense that there are no scientific laws that mental states can figure into without having exceptions. There are no "strict" laws, and mental events must factor into strict laws in order to fit respectably into the causal order described by current science [see {{harv|Davidson| 1970}}].

In short, one response has been to deny that psychological laws involving mental states require strict, exceptionless laws. Jerry Fodor argues that non-basic (or "special") sciences do not in fact require strict laws {{harv|Fodor|1980}}. In current practice, special sciences (for example, biology and chemistry) have ''ceteris paribus'' laws (or laws with "all else being equal" clauses), according to which there are exceptions. However, only in the basic sciences (physics) are there strict, exceptionless laws. Thus, although mental states are anomalous, they can still figure into scientifically respectable laws of psychology.

=== Problem of externalism ===
In the latter half of the twentieth century externalism about meaning became espoused by many philosophers. Externalism is roughly the view that certain parts of an individual's environment play a crucial role in the meaning of at least some of an individual's words [see {{harv|Putnam| 1975}} and {{harv|Burge|1979}}]. A thesis about meaning affects the mind insofar as our thoughts are ''about'' things in the world. A common view in the philosophy of mind is that at least certain mental states have intentional content in this sense. For example, one's belief that water is wet has the semantic content of ''water is wet''. The thought is about water and the fact that it is wet. But, if externalism is true—if some of the contents of one's thoughts are constituted at least in part by factors external to one's mind—then there is yet another difficulty in explaining how mental states can cause physical states {{harv|Yoo|2006|p=§3b.ii}}].

== Commonsensical Solutions ==


===Causal Exclusion Counter-Argument=== 

Causal exclusion is only a problem for mental causation if you are an advocate for physicalism.  I will begin with Jaegwon Kim’s causal exclusion argument which states that if all physical effects have sufficient physical causes, and no physical effects are caused twice over by distinct physical and mental causes, there cannot be any irreducible mental causes (Kallestrup 2006).  First of all, the antecedent of the causal exclusion argument is the definition of physicalism.  Kim states that if all physical effects have sufficient physical causes. This statement alone negates dualism, idealism and mental causation.  Whereas, it is redundant to state the remaining of the causal exclusion argument because if all physical effects have sufficient physical causes, then no physical effects would be caused twice over by any substance other than physical.  Also, if all physical effects have sufficient physical causes, then there clearly would not be any reducible or irreducible mental causes.  Secondly, if a person does not support physicalism, then they are not going to support the view that all physical effects have sufficient physical causes.  Lastly, physicalism is the hypothesis that the mind is the same as the brain and/or the mental supervenes on the physical, yet it is not fact.  Therefore, to use the hypothesis of causal exclusion as evidence to counter mental causation is no different than using "the popper's three world formulation" or "psychological nativism" (as shown in this section) to support mental causation.

===The Advent of Crying===

It is an arduous task to prove mental causation within the realms of a physical body.  Yet, every human has witnessed mental causation within the human body.  Let us view the advent of crying.  Crying is a physical effect coupled with either a physical cause or a mental (emotional) cause.  There are three types of tears: basal tears, reflex tears, and emotional tears (Hoyt 2008).  Basal tears keep our eyes from drying out, reflex tears are in response to eye irritants (physical causation), and emotional tears are a result of mental causation such as sadness, joy, etc (Hoyt 2008).  I am going to focus on the latter, emotional tears.  Once sadness is registered in the cerebrum, the endocrine system releases hormones to the ocular area, and tears are formed (Hoyt 2008).  Crying due to one's mental state is an event that is common across all cultures and demographics.  Whether we cry due to sadness or joy, these are all events that have their origination in mental causation.  It would be inhuman to claim otherwise.

How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain by Lisa Feldman Barrett for a rigorous discussion. One’s crying is not planned, unless one is an actor, then we are able to tap into the mechanism that causes tears to flow. Otherwise it just happens outside of out awareness of causing it by thinking. The brain has patterns of neurons that once activated generate physiologic responses that happens up to 10 seconds before we are aware. (Koch, Christof. 2012. “How Physics and Neuroscience Dictate Your “Free” Will”.  Scientific American:  April 12.) and many others.

==Traditional Solutions==

=== Dualist solutions ===
{{Main article|Philosophy of mind|Dualism (philosophy of mind)}}

Some have claimed that while the mental and the physical are quite different things, they can nonetheless causally interact with one another, a view going back to Descartes [{{harv|Descartes| 1642/1986}}, especially meditations II &amp; VI]. This view is known as ''[[interactionist dualism]]''. The major problem that interactionist dualism faces is that of explicating a satisfactory notion of causation according to which non-spatial events, such as mental events, can causally interact with physical events. According to the current mainstream scientific world-view, the physical realm is [[Causal closure|''causally closed'']], in that causal relationships only hold among physical events in the physical realm. Given these types of considerations, some argue that it is appropriate to say that the main assumptions in interactionist dualism generate the problem of mental causation rather than solve it (see {{harv|Yoo| 2006|p=§1a}}.

=== Physicalist solutions ===
{{Main article|Physicalism}}
{{See also|Monism}}

The other major option is to assert that mental events are either (at least contingently) identical to physical events, or [[Supervenience|supervene]] on physical events. Views that fall under this general heading are called [[physicalism]] or [[materialism]]. But, such views require a particular theory to explain how mental events are physical in nature. One such theory is [[behaviorism]]. Behaviorists, in general, argue that mental events are merely dispositions to behave in certain ways. Another theory is the [[identity theory of mind|identity theory]], according to which mental events are (either type- or token-) identical to physical events. A more recent view, known as [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], claims that mental events are individuated (or constituted by) the causal role they play. As such, mental events would fit directly into the causal realm, as they are simply certain causal (or functional) roles. Finally, there is [[eliminative materialism]], which simply denies that there are any such mental events; thus, there is really no problem of mental causation at all.

=== Idealism-Related solutions ===


==== Popper's three-world formulation ====
Related to [[#Dualist solutions|dualism]] above, a more general and somewhat differently posed approach to mental causation is provided by [[Popper's three worlds|Karl Popper's three worlds]]. [[Karl Popper|Popper]] split the world into three categories:&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt;
# The world of physical [[object (philosophy)|object]]s and [[event (philosophy)|event]]s, including [[biology|biological]] entities
# The mental or psychological world, the world of our feelings of pain and of pleasure, of our thoughts, of our decisions, of our perceptions and our observations; in other words, the world of mental or psychological states or processes, or of subjective experiences.
# The world of products of the human mind, including art, science, and religion.

World 3 includes physical theory as a particular case. But World 3 is a creation of the human imagination, and such acts of imagination are a part of World 2. Accordingly, one could argue that the physical notion of causality is a child of the imagination, and although causation has its successes in describing World 1, it may not apply to World 2 or World 3. The subjective aspects of theories contained in World 3 are not readily framed within the third-person perspective of science used to explain World 1.

From this perspective, it is hubris to suppose that the methods successful in describing World 1, in particular to suppose the notions of ''cause'' and ''effect'', invented by World 2 in its creation of the theory of World 3 used to explain World 1, have direct application to Worlds 2 and 3 themselves, and control mental agency.

==== Psychological nativism ====
A still different approach to mental causation is based upon the philosophies of Kant, Chomsky and Pinker. These philosophers stress the impact of built-in aspects of mind, studied in the field of [[psychological nativism]].&lt;ref name=Nativism/&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) pointed out that we all shape our experience of things through the filter of our mind, a view sometimes called [[epistemological solipsism]]. The mind shapes that experience, and among other things, Kant believed the concepts of ''space'' and ''time'' were programmed into the human brain, as was the notion of ''cause'' and ''effect''.&lt;ref name= Warburton0/&gt; We never have ''direct'' experience of things, the ''noumenal'' world, and what we do experience is the ''phenomenal'' world as conveyed by our senses, this conveyance processed by the machinery of the mind and nervous system. Kant focused upon this processing. Kant believed in [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] knowledge arrived at independent of experience, so-called ''synthetic'' ''a priori'' knowledge. In particular, he thought that by introspection some aspects of the filtering mechanisms of the mind/brain/nervous system could be discovered.&lt;ref name= Warburton0/&gt; The following observations summarize Kant's views upon the subject-object problem, called [[Copernican Revolution (metaphor)#The .22Copernican Revolution in philosophy.22|Kant's Copernican revolution]]: 
{{quote|"It has hitherto been assumed that our cognition must conform to the objects; but all attempts to ascertain anything about these objects ''a priori'', by means of conceptions, and thus to extend the range of our knowledge, have been rendered abortive by this assumption. Let us then make the experiment whether we may not be more successful in metaphysics, if we assume that the objects must conform to our cognition. This appears, at all events, to accord better with the possibility of our gaining the end we have in view, that is to say, of arriving at the cognition of objects ''a priori'', of determining something with respect to these objects, before they are given to us. We here propose to do just what Copernicus did in attempting to explain the celestial movements. When he found that he could make no progress by assuming that all the heavenly bodies revolved round the spectator, he reversed the process, and tried the experiment of assuming that the spectator revolved, while the stars remained at rest. We may make the same experiment with regard to the intuition of objects."&lt;ref name=Critique/&gt;|Immanuel Kant|English translation by [[J. M. D. Meiklejohn]] of ''The Critique of Pure Reason'' (1781)}}
Although Kant has posed the issue of built-in aspects of mind, the particulars that depend upon the science of his day have become outmoded. A more recent approach to these limitations is proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Steven Pinker]]. Like Kant, [[Noam Chomsky]] raised the issue of the mind's inherent programming. Chomsky selected as a particular example the acquiring of language by children.&lt;ref name=Nativism/&gt; Of course, language is indispensable in the formulation and communication of our perceptions of the objective world:
{{quote|"People do not think in English or Chinese or Apache; they think in a language of thought. This language of thought probably looks a bit like all these languages;...But compared with any given language, mentalese must be richer in some ways and simpler in others."&lt;ref name=Pinker/&gt;|Steven Pinker|The Language Instinct,  p. 72}} 
Chomsky marshaled evidence that a child's rapid mastery of the complexity of language indicated an innate ability programmed into the development of the human mind from birth that could not be explained by the [[Tabula rasa|"blank slate"]] view of the infant mind. Rather, the mind has a built-in propensity to process symbolic representations. The origins of this ability were sought by [[Steven Pinker]] in a [[Survival of the fittest|Darwinian struggle]] that established the survival value of the ability to communicate.&lt;ref name=Pinker/&gt;  According to Pinker, [[Charles Darwin]] himself "concluded that language ability is 'an instinctive tendency to acquire an art', a design that is not peculiar to humans but seen in other species such as song-learning birds." This observation is strongly supported by [[Crow#Behavior|research on crows]].&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;

This work can be taken to suggest that although a physical theory is an intermediary between our observations and our notions of connections between them, it is an elaborate mental construction that is a meld of the way the mind works and objective observations. Although a physical theory is used to determine connections about objective events,  the specific form of the theoretical construct is a product of subjective activities, and this particular form may well involve the workings of the brain. Perhaps some aspects of the universe's operation can be expressed in terms of mental constructs, but this process is analogous with the expression of a [[computer algorithm]] in terms of [[assembly language]] instructions peculiar to a particular computer, a translation by a [[compiler]] of the general statement of an algorithm into specific tiny steps that particular computer can handle.&lt;ref name=Edelman/&gt;

From this standpoint, as with the philosophy of Kant, the first-person active actions of mental causation may involve innate workings of the brain itself.

The '''red-billed gull''' (''Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae scopulinus''), once also known as the '''mackerel gull''', is a native of [[New Zealand]], being found throughout the country and on outlying islands including the [[Chatham Islands]] and [[subantarctic]] islands. It was formerly considered as a separate species but is now usually treated as a [[subspecies]] of the [[silver gull]] (''Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae'').&lt;ref name=ioc&gt;{{cite web| editor1-last=Gill | editor1-first=Frank | editor1-link=Frank Gill (ornithologist) | editor2-last=Donsker | editor2-first=David | year=2017 | title=Coursers, noddies, gulls, terns, auks &amp; sandgrouse | work=World Bird List Version 7.2 | url=http://www.worldbirdnames.org/bow/coursers/| publisher=International Ornithologists' Union | accessdate=21 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hbw&gt;{{cite book | last1=Burger | first1=J. | last2=Gochfeld | first2=M. | last3=Kirwan | first3=G.M. | last4=Garcia | first4=E.F.J. | chapter=Silver Gull (''Larus novaehollandiae'') | editor1-last=del Hoyo | editor1-first=J. | editor2-last=Elliott | editor2-first=A. | editor3-last=Sargatal | editor3-first=J. | editor4-last=Christie | editor4-first=D.A. | editor5-last=de Juana | editor5-first=E. | title=Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive | publisher=Lynx Edicions | chapterurl=http://www.hbw.com/node/53991 | accessdate=21 April 2017 | subscription=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Māori language|Māori]] name of this species is '''tarapunga''' or '''akiaki'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barrie Heather|author2=Hugh Robertson|last-author-amp=yes|title=The Field Guide to the Birds of New Zealand|edition=revised|publisher=Viking|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its vernacular name is sometimes also used for the [[dolphin gull]], a somewhat similar-looking but unrelated species. As is the case with many gulls, the red-billed gull has traditionally been placed in the [[genus]] ''[[Larus]]''.

==Description==
[[File:Chroicocephalus scopulinus -Picton, Marlborough, New Zealand -upper body-8.jpg|left|thumb|Upper body]]
The red-billed gull is a fairly small [[gull]] with an all-red bill, red eye ring, red legs and feet, pale grey wings with black wingtips. The rest of the body and tail are white. There is virtually no [[sexual dimorphism|visual difference between the male and female birds]]. Juvenile gulls have a dark brown bill with only hints of red, making them difficult to distinguish from the [[black-billed gull]]. The legs are also brown and there are brown spots on the grey wings.

==Distribution==
It is the smallest gull commonly seen in New Zealand; a recent estimate of the population puts it at half a million birds in the country. Until recently it was regarded as a [[subspecies]] of the [[silver gull]] found in [[Australia]], and the two species are very similar in appearance. However the most recent research suggests that they are not particularly closely related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shirihai, H.|year=2002|title=A complete guide to Antarctic wildlife|publisher= Alula Press, Oy, Finland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behaviour==
[[File:Red billed gull eating berries 02.jpg|thumb|left|Eating [[Coprosma repens|taupata]] berries]]
Behaviourally, the red-billed gull is a typical gull. It is an aggressive [[scavenger]] and [[kleptoparasitism|kleptoparasite]]. Since European settlement its numbers have increased, especially around coastal towns and cities where it can scavenge from urban waste. It normally feeds on small fish, shell fish and worms (from pastures), and sometimes berries, lizards and insects.

==Life cycle==
They nest from October to December in colonies on the coast, either on islands or rocky headlands, cliffs and beaches. The birds form [[pair bond]]s which endure across seasons, but there is a certain amount of [[extra-pair copulation]]. [[Courtship feeding]] is an important part of the preparation for mating. Nests are well formed and may be constructed of seaweed, grasses, leaves and ice plants. Generally two to three eggs are laid, their colour ranges from brown to grey with light and dark brown spots all over. The bird generally lives up to 12 years, although individuals have also been found living up to 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Ex-pat Kiwi returns from US to study red-billed seagulls|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/marlborough-express/news/kaikoura/3187352/Ex-pat-Kiwi-returns-from-US-to-study-red-billed-seagulls|newspaper = [[Stuff.co.nz]]|date = Dec 23, 2009|access-date = 2015-06-21|first = Emma|last = Dangerfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chapitel IX. of Die Theorie der algebraischen Zahlkörper.png|thumb|Chapter IX of [[David Hilbert]]'s ''Die Theorie der algebraischen Zahlkörper.'' The chapter title is Die Zahlringe des Körpers, literally "the number rings of the field". The word "ring" is the contraction of "Zahlring".]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''ring''' is one of the fundamental [[algebraic structure]]s used in [[abstract algebra]]. It consists of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] equipped with two [[binary operation]]s that generalize the [[arithmetic operation]]s of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]]. Through this generalization, theorems from [[arithmetic]] are extended to non-numerical objects such as [[polynomial]]s, [[series (mathematics)|series]], [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] and [[function (mathematics)|functions]].

A ring is an [[abelian group]] with a second [[binary operation]] that is [[Associative_property|associative]], is [[Distributive property|distributive]] over the abelian group operation, and has an [[identity element]] (this last property is not required by some authors, see {{slink||Notes on the definition}}). By extension from the [[integer]]s, the abelian group operation is called ''addition'' and the second binary operation is called ''multiplication''.

Whether a ring is commutative or not (i.e., whether the order in which two elements are multiplied changes the result or not) has profound implications on its behavior as an abstract object. As a result, commutative ring theory, commonly known as [[commutative algebra]], is a key topic in [[ring theory]]. Its development has been greatly influenced by problems and ideas occurring naturally in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]]. Examples of commutative rings include the set of integers equipped with the addition and multiplication operations, the set of polynomials equipped with their addition and multiplication, the [[coordinate ring]] of an [[affine algebraic variety]], and the [[ring of integers]] of a number field. Examples of noncommutative rings include the ring of ''n'' × ''n'' real [[square matrix|square matrices]] with ''n'' ≥ 2, [[group ring]]s in [[representation theory]], [[operator algebra]]s in [[functional analysis]], [[ring of differential operators|rings of differential operators]] in the theory of [[differential operator]]s, and the [[cohomology ring]] of a [[topological space]] in [[topology]].

The conceptualization of rings began in the 1870s and was completed in the 1920s. Key contributors include [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Abraham Fraenkel|Fraenkel]], and [[Emmy Noether|Noether]]. Rings were first formalized as a generalization of [[Dedekind domain]]s that occur in [[number theory]], and of [[polynomial ring]]s and rings of invariants that occur in [[algebraic geometry]] and [[invariant theory]]. Afterward, they also proved to be useful in other branches of mathematics such as [[geometry]] and [[mathematical analysis]].

== Definition and illustration ==

The most familiar example of a ring is the set of all [[integer]]s, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, consisting of the [[number]]s

:.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;, −5, −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

The familiar properties for addition and multiplication of integers serve as a model for the axioms for rings.

=== Definition ===
A '''ring''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''R'' equipped with two [[binary operation]]s&lt;ref&gt;This means that each operation is defined and produces a unique result in ''R'' for each ordered pair of elements of ''R''.&lt;/ref&gt; + and '''·''' satisfying the following three sets of axioms, called the '''ring axioms'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=Algebra|publisher=Springer-Verlag|section=§I.8|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Algebra|author1=[[Saunders MacLane]]|author2=Garrett Birkhoff|publisher=AMS Chelsea|page=85|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Serge Lang]]|title=Algebra|publisher=Springer-Verlag|page=83|year=2002|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. ''R'' is an [[abelian group]] under addition, meaning that:
:* (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''R''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(that is, + is [[associativity|associative]]).
:* ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'' for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''R''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(that is, + is [[commutativity|commutative]]).
:* There is an element 0 in ''R'' such that ''a'' + 0 = ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''R''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(that is, 0 is the [[additive identity]]).
:* For each ''a'' in ''R'' there exists −''a'' in ''R'' such that ''a'' + (−''a'') = 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(that is, −''a'' is the [[additive inverse]] of ''a'').
2. ''R'' is a [[monoid]] under multiplication, meaning that:
:* (''a'' · ''b'') · ''c'' = ''a'' · (''b'' · ''c'') for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''R''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(that is, · is associative).
:* There is an element 1 in ''R'' such that ''a'' · 1 = ''a'' and 1 · ''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''R''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(that is, 1 is the [[multiplicative identity]]).&lt;ref&gt;The existence of 1 is not assumed by some authors; here, the term "[[Rng (algebra)|rng]]" is used if existence of a multiplicative identity is not assumed.&lt;!-- This is the most common convention, and is adopted throughout wikipedia, please do not change --&gt; See [[Ring (mathematics)#Notes on the definition|next subsection]]&lt;/ref&gt;
3. Multiplication is [[distributive law|distributive]] with respect to addition:
:* ''a'' ⋅ (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') + (''a'' · ''c'') for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''R''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(left distributivity).
:* (''b'' + ''c'') · ''a'' = (''b'' · ''a'') + (''c'' · ''a'') for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''R''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(right distributivity).

=== Notes on the definition ===
As explained in {{section link||History}} below, many authors follow an alternative convention in which a ring is not defined to have a multiplicative identity. This article adopts the convention that, unless otherwise stated, a ring is assumed to have such an identity. &lt;!--- This is also the convention in [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Mathematics]]. ---&gt; A structure satisfying all the axioms ''except'' the requirement that there exists a multiplicative identity element is called a '''[[rng (algebra)|rng]]''' (commonly pronounced "rung", and sometimes called a '''[[pseudo-ring]]'''). For example, the set of even integers with the usual + and ⋅ is a rng, but not a ring.

The operations + and ⋅ are called ''addition'' and ''multiplication'', respectively. The multiplication symbol ⋅ is often omitted, so the [[wikt:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]] of ring elements is interpreted as multiplication. For example, ''xy'' means {{nowrap|''x'' ⋅ ''y''}}.

Although ring addition is [[commutative law|commutative]], ring multiplication is not required to be commutative: ''ab'' need not necessarily equal ''ba''. Rings that also satisfy commutativity for multiplication (such as the ring of [[integer]]s) are called '''[[commutative ring]]s'''. Books on commutative algebra or algebraic geometry often adopt the convention that "ring" means "commutative ring", to simplify terminology.

In a ring, multiplication does not have to have an inverse. A (non-[[zero ring|trivial]]) commutative ring such that every nonzero element has a [[multiplicative inverse]] is called a [[field (mathematics)|field]].

The additive group of a ring is the ring equipped just with the structure of addition. Although the definition assumes that the additive group is abelian, this can be inferred from the other ring axioms.&lt;ref&gt;I. M. Isaacs, Algebra: A Graduate Course, AMS, 1994, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Basic properties ===
Some basic properties of a ring follow immediately from the axioms:
* The additive identity, the additive inverse of each element, and the multiplicative identity are unique.
* For any element ''x'' in a ring ''R'', one has ''x''0 = 0 = 0''x'' (zero is an [[absorbing element]] with respect to multiplication) and (–1)''x'' = –''x''.
* If 0 = 1 in a ring ''R'' (or more generally, 0 is a unit element), then ''R'' has only one element, and is called the [[zero ring]].
* The [[binomial formula]] holds for any commuting pair of elements (i.e., any ''x'' and ''y'' such that ''xy'' = ''yx'').

=== Example: Integers modulo 4 ===
{{see also| Modular arithmetic}}

Equip the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_4 = \{\overline{0},\overline{1},\overline{2},\overline{3}\}&lt;/math&gt; with the following operations:

* The sum &lt;math&gt;\overline{x} + \overline{y}&lt;/math&gt; in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the remainder when the integer ''x'' + ''y'' is divided by 4 (as ''x'' + ''y'' is always smaller than 8, this remainder is either ''x'' + ''y'' or ''x'' + ''y'' – 4). For example, &lt;math&gt;\overline{2} + \overline{3} = \overline{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{3} + \overline{3} = \overline{2}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The product &lt;math&gt;\overline{x} \cdot \overline{y}&lt;/math&gt; in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the remainder when the integer ''xy'' is divided by 4. For example, &lt;math&gt;\overline{2} \cdot \overline{3} = \overline{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{3} \cdot \overline{3} = \overline{1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is a ring: each axiom follows from the corresponding axiom for '''Z'''. If ''x'' is an integer, the remainder of ''x'' when divided by 4 may be considered as an element of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and this element is often denoted by {{nowrap|"''x'' mod 4"}} or &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}&lt;/math&gt;, which is consistent with the notation for 0,1,2,3. The additive inverse of any &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}&lt;/math&gt; in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\overline{-x}&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt;-\overline{3}= \overline{-3} = \overline{1}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example: 2-by-2 matrices ===
{{main|Matrix ring}}
The set of 2-by-2 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with [[real number]] entries is written

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_2(\mathbb{R}) = \left\{ \left.\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{pmatrix} \right|\  a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{R} \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

With the operations of matrix addition and [[matrix multiplication]], this set satisfies the above ring axioms. The element &lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is the multiplicative identity of the ring. If &lt;math&gt;A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B=\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;AB=\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;BA=\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;; this example shows that the ring is noncommutative.

More generally, for any ring ''R'', commutative or not, and any nonnegative integer ''n'', one may form the ring of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices with entries in ''R'': see [[Matrix ring]].

== History ==

{{See also|Ring theory#History}}
[[File:Dedekind.jpeg|thumb|100px|right|[[Richard Dedekind]], one of the founders of [[ring theory]].]]

=== Dedekind ===
The study of rings originated from the theory of [[polynomial ring]]s and the theory of [[algebraic integer]]s.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Ring_theory.html The development of Ring Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, [[Richard Dedekind]] defined the concept of the ring of integers of a number field.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, he introduced the terms "ideal" (inspired by [[Ernst Kummer]]'s notion of ideal number) and "module" and studied their properties. But Dedekind did not use the term "ring" and did not define the concept of a ring in a general setting.

=== Hilbert ===
The term "Zahlring" (number ring) was coined by [[David Hilbert]] in 1892 and published in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; In 19th century German, the word "Ring" could mean "association", which is still used today in English in a limited sense (e.g., spy ring),&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathoverflow.net/questions/117292/why-is-a-ring-called-a-ring Why is a ring called a "ring"? - MathOverflow]&lt;/ref&gt; so if that were the etymology then it would be similar to the way "group" entered mathematics by being a non-technical word for "collection of related things". According to Harvey Cohn, Hilbert used the term for a ring that had the property of "circling directly back" to an element of itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cohn|first=Harvey|title=Advanced Number Theory|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|year=1980|page=49|isbn=978-0-486-64023-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in a ring of algebraic integers, all high powers of an algebraic integer can be written as an integral combination of a fixed set of lower powers, and thus the powers "cycle back". For instance, if {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 4''a'' + 1 = 0}} then {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 4''a'' − 1}}, {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 4''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''a''}}, {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = −''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 16''a'' − 4}}, {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = 16''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 8''a'' + 1}}, {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = −8''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 65''a'' − 16}}, and so on; in general, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is going to be an integral linear combination of 1, ''a'', and ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Fraenkel and Noether ===
The first axiomatic definition of a ring was given by [[Abraham Fraenkel|Adolf Fraenkel]] in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;Fraenkel, pp.&amp;nbsp;143–145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 86, footnote 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but his axioms were stricter than those in the modern definition. For instance, he required every [[zero divisor|non-zero-divisor]] to have a [[multiplicative inverse]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraenkel, p.&amp;nbsp;144, axiom&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;8)&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, [[Emmy Noether]] gave the modern axiomatic definition of [[commutative ring|(commutative) ring]] and developed the foundations of commutative ring theory in her paper ''Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen''.&lt;ref name="Noether, p. 29"&gt;Noether, p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiplicative identity: mandatory vs. optional ===
Fraenkel required a ring to have a multiplicative identity 1,&lt;ref&gt;Fraenkel, p.&amp;nbsp;144, axiom&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;7)&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Noether did not.&lt;ref name="Noether, p. 29"/&gt;

Most or all books on algebra&lt;ref&gt;Van der Waerden, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zariski and Samuel, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; up to around 1960 followed Noether's convention of not requiring a 1. Starting in the 1960s, it became increasingly common to see books including the existence of 1 in the definition of ring, especially in advanced books by notable authors such as Artin,&lt;ref&gt;Artin, p.&amp;nbsp;346.&lt;/ref&gt; Atiyah and MacDonald,&lt;ref&gt;Atiyah and MacDonald, p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; Bourbaki,&lt;ref&gt;Bourbaki, p.&amp;nbsp;96.&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenbud,&lt;ref&gt;Eisenbud, p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lang.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt; But even today, there remain many books that do not require a 1.

Faced with this terminological ambiguity, some authors have tried to impose their views, while others have tried to adopt more precise terms.

In the first category, we find for instance Gardner and Wiegandt, who argue that if one requires all rings to have a 1, then some consequences include the lack of existence of infinite direct sums of rings, and the fact that proper direct summands of rings are not subrings. They conclude that "in many, maybe most, branches of ring theory the requirement of the existence of a unity element is not sensible, and therefore unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;Gardner and Wiegandt 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second category, we find authors who use the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;Wilder 1965, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rotman 1998, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

:* rings with multiplicative identity: ''unital ring'', ''unitary ring'', ''unit ring'', ''ring with unity'', ''ring with identity'', or ''ring with 1''
:* rings not requiring multiplicative identity: ''[[rng (algebra)|rng]]'' or ''[[pseudo-ring]]'', although the latter may be confusing, as having other meanings.

== Basic examples ==

'''Commutative rings''':
* The prototype example is the ring of [[integer]]s with the two operations of addition and multiplication.
* The rational, real and complex numbers are commutative rings of a type called [[field (mathematics)|fields]].
* An [[algebra over a ring]] is itself a ring. These are also [[module (mathematics)|modules]]. Some examples:
** Any [[algebra over a field]].
** The [[polynomial ring]] ''R''[''X''] of polynomials over a ring ''R'' is itself a ring. A [[free module]] over ''R'' of infinite dimension.
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}[c]&lt;/math&gt;, the integers with an irrational number ''c'' adjoined. A free module of infinite dimension if ''c'' is a [[transcendental number]], a free module of finite dimension if ''c'' is an [[algebraic integer]].
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}[1/n]&lt;/math&gt;, the set of [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] whose denominators are a power of ''n'' (including negative ones). A non-free module.
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}[1/10]&lt;/math&gt;, the set of [[decimal fraction]]s.
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}[(1+\sqrt d)/2]&lt;/math&gt;, where ''d'' is a [[square-free]] integer of the form 4''n''+1. A free module of rank two. Cf. [[Quadratic integer]]s.
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}[i]&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Gaussian integer]]s.
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}[(1+\sqrt{-3})/2]&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Eisenstein integer]]s. Also their generalization, a [[Kummer ring]].
* The set of all [[algebraic integer]]s forms a ring. This follows for example from the fact that it is the [[integral closure]] of the ring of rational integers in the field of complex numbers. The rings in the three previous examples are subrings of this ring.
* The set of [[formal power series]] ''R''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; over a commutative ring ''R'' is a ring.
* If ''S'' is a set, then the [[power set]] of ''S'' becomes a ring if we define addition to be the [[symmetric difference]] of sets and multiplication to be [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]. This corresponds to a [[ring of sets]] and is an example of a [[Boolean ring]].
* The set of all [[continuous function|continuous]] real-valued [[function (mathematics)|functions]] defined on the real line forms a commutative ring. The operations are [[pointwise]] addition and multiplication of functions.
* Let ''X'' be a set and ''R'' a ring. Then the set of all functions from ''X'' to ''R'' forms a ring, which is commutative if ''R'' is commutative. The ring of continuous functions in the previous example is a subring of this ring if ''X'' is the real line and ''R'' is the field of real numbers.

'''Noncommutative rings''':
* For any ring ''R'' and any natural number ''n'', the set of all square ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with entries from ''R'', forms a ring with matrix addition and matrix multiplication as operations. For ''n'' = 1, this matrix ring is isomorphic to ''R'' itself. For ''n'' &gt; 1 (and ''R'' not the zero ring), this matrix ring is noncommutative.
* If ''G'' is an [[abelian group]], then the [[group homomorphism|endomorphisms]] of ''G'' form a ring, the [[endomorphism ring]] End(''G'') of ''G''. The operations in this ring are addition and composition of endomorphisms. More generally, if ''V'' is a [[left module]] over a ring ''R'', then the set of all ''R''-linear maps forms a ring, also called the endomorphism ring and denoted by End&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;(''V'').
* If ''G'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] and ''R'' is a ring, the [[group ring]] of ''G'' over ''R'' is a [[free module]] over ''R'' having ''G'' as basis. Multiplication is defined by the rules that the elements of ''G'' commute with the elements of ''R'' and multiply together as they do in the group ''G''.
* Many rings that appear in analysis are noncommutative. For example, most [[Banach algebra]]s are noncommutative.

'''Non-rings:'''
* The set of [[natural number]]s '''N''' with the usual operations is not a ring, since ('''N''', +) is not even a [[group (mathematics)|group]] (the elements are not all [[invertible]] with respect to [[addition]]). For instance, there is no [[natural number]] which can be added to 3 to get 0 as a result. There is a natural way to make it a ring by adding negative numbers to the set, thus obtaining the ring of [[integer]]s. The natural numbers (including 0) form an algebraic structure known as a [[semiring]] (which has all of the properties of a ring except the additive inverse property).
* Let ''R'' be the set of all continuous functions on the real line that vanish outside a bounded interval depending on the function, with addition as usual but with multiplication defined as [[convolution]]:
*: &lt;math&gt;(f * g)(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(y)g(x-y)dy.&lt;/math&gt;
:Then ''R'' is a [[rng (algebra)|rng]], but not a ring: the [[Dirac delta function]] has the property of a multiplicative identity, but it is not a function and hence is not an element of ''R''.

== Basic concepts ==

=== Elements in a ring ===
A left [[zero divisor]] of a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a nonzero element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in the ring such that there exists a nonzero element &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ab = 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;This is the definition of Bourbaki. Some other authors such as Lang require a zero divisor to be nonzero.&lt;/ref&gt; A right zero divisor is defined similarly.

A [[nilpotent element]] is an element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a^n = 0&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. One example of a nilpotent element is a [[nilpotent matrix]]. A nilpotent element in a [[zero ring|nonzero ring]] is necessarily a zero divisor.

An [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent]] &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is an element such that &lt;math&gt;e^2 = e&lt;/math&gt;. One example of an idempotent element is a [[projection (linear algebra)|projection]] in linear algebra.

A [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] is an element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; having a [[multiplicative inverse]]; in this case the inverse is unique, and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. The set of units of a ring is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under ring multiplication; this group is denoted by &lt;math&gt;R^\times&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;U(R)&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if ''R'' is the ring of all square matrices of size ''n'' over a field, then &lt;math&gt;R^\times&lt;/math&gt; consists of the set of all invertible matrices of size ''n'', and is called the [[general linear group]].

=== Subring ===
{{main|Subring}}
A subset ''S'' of ''R'' is said to be a [[subring]] if it can be regarded as a ring with the addition and the multiplication [[restricted function|restricted]] from ''R'' to ''S''. Equivalently, ''S'' is a subring if it is not empty, and for any ''x'', ''y'' in ''S'', &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x+y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-x&lt;/math&gt; are in ''S''. If all rings have been assumed, by convention, to have a multiplicative identity, then to be a subring one would also require ''S'' to share the same identity element as ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;In the unital case, like addition and multiplication, the multiplicative identity must be restricted from the original ring. The definition is also equivalent to requiring the set-theoretic inclusion is a ring homomorphism.&lt;/ref&gt; So if all rings have been assumed to have a multiplicative identity, then a proper ideal is not a subring.

For example, the ring '''Z''' of [[integer]]s is a subring of the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real number]]s and also a subring of the ring of [[polynomial]]s '''Z'''[''X''] (in both cases, '''Z''' contains 1, which is the multiplicative identity of the larger rings). On the other hand, the subset of even integers 2'''Z''' does not contain the identity element 1 and thus does not qualify as a subring of '''Z'''.

An intersection of subrings is a subring. The smallest subring containing a given subset ''E'' of ''R'' is called a subring generated by ''E''. Such a subring exists since it is the intersection of all subrings containing ''E''.

For a ring ''R'', the smallest subring containing 1 is called the ''characteristic subring'' of ''R''. It can be obtained by adding copies of 1 and −1 together many times in any mixture. It is possible that &lt;math&gt;n\cdot 1=1+1+\ldots+1&lt;/math&gt; (''n'' times) can be zero. If ''n'' is the smallest positive integer such that this occurs, then ''n'' is called the ''[[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]'' of ''R''. In some rings, &lt;math&gt;n\cdot 1&lt;/math&gt; is never zero for any positive integer ''n'', and those rings are said to have ''characteristic zero''.&lt;!-- By using a homomorphism from the integers into ''R'' that sends 1 to 1, it can be shown by an isomorphism theorem that the characteristic subring is always a quotient ring of the integers. The problem: we haven't introduced homomorphisms and quotient rings yet. --&gt;

Given a ring ''R'', let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Z}(R)&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of all elements ''x'' in ''R'' such that ''x'' commutes with every element in ''R'': &lt;math&gt;xy = yx&lt;/math&gt; for any ''y'' in ''R''. Then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Z}(R)&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of ''R''; called the [[center (algebra)|center]] of ''R''. More generally, given a subset ''X'' of ''R'', let ''S'' be the set of all elements in ''R'' that commute with every element in ''X''. Then ''S'' is a subring of ''R'', called the [[centralizer (ring theory)|centralizer]] (or commutant) of ''X''. The center is the centralizer of the entire ring ''R''. Elements or subsets of the center are said to be ''central'' in ''R''; they generate a subring of the center.

=== Ideal ===
{{main|Ideal (ring theory)}}
The definition of an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in a ring is analogous to that of [[normal subgroup]] in a group. But, in actuality, it plays a role of an idealized generalization of an element in a ring; hence, the name "ideal". Like elements of rings, the study of ideals is central to structural understanding of a ring.

Let ''R'' be a ring. A nonempty subset ''I'' of ''R'' is then said to be a '''left ideal''' in ''R'' if, for any ''x'', ''y'' in ''I'' and ''r'' in ''R'', &lt;math&gt;x+y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;rx&lt;/math&gt; are in ''I''. If &lt;math&gt;R I&lt;/math&gt; denotes the span of ''I'' over ''R''; i.e., the set of finite sums
:&lt;math&gt;r_1 x_1 + \cdots + r_n x_n, \quad r_i \in R, \quad x_i \in I,&lt;/math&gt;
then ''I'' is a left ideal if &lt;math&gt;R I \subseteq I&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, ''I'' is said to be '''right ideal''' if &lt;math&gt;I R \subseteq I&lt;/math&gt;. A subset ''I'' is said to be a '''two-sided ideal''' or simply '''ideal''' if it is both a left ideal and right ideal. A one-sided or two-sided ideal is then an additive subgroup of ''R''. If ''E'' is a subset of ''R'', then &lt;math&gt;R E&lt;/math&gt; is a left ideal, called the left ideal generated by ''E''; it is the smallest left ideal containing ''E''. Similarly, one can consider the right ideal or the two-sided ideal generated by a subset of ''R''.

If ''x'' is in ''R'', then &lt;math&gt;Rx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;xR&lt;/math&gt; are left ideals and right ideals, respectively; they are called the [[principal ideal|principal]] left ideals and right ideals generated by ''x''. The principal ideal &lt;math&gt;RxR&lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the set of all positive and negative multiples of 2 along with 0 form an ideal of the integers, and this ideal is generated by the integer 2. In fact, every ideal of the ring of integers is principal.

Like a group, a ring is said to be [[simple ring|simple]] if it is nonzero and it has no proper nonzero two-sided ideals. A commutative simple ring is precisely a field.

Rings are often studied with special conditions set upon their ideals. For example, a ring in which there is no strictly increasing infinite [[total order#Chains|chain]] of left ideals is called a left [[Noetherian ring]]. A ring in which there is no strictly decreasing infinite chain of left ideals is called a left [[Artinian ring]]. It is a somewhat surprising fact that a left Artinian ring is left Noetherian (the [[Hopkins–Levitzki theorem]]). The integers, however, form a Noetherian ring which is not Artinian.

For commutative rings, the ideals generalize the classical notion of divisibility and decomposition of an integer into prime numbers in algebra. A proper ideal ''P'' of ''R'' is called a [[prime ideal]] if for any elements &lt;math&gt;x, y\in R&lt;/math&gt; we have that &lt;math&gt;xy \in P&lt;/math&gt; implies either &lt;math&gt;x \in P&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y\in P&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, ''P'' is prime if for any ideals &lt;math&gt;I, J&lt;/math&gt; we have that &lt;math&gt;IJ \subseteq P&lt;/math&gt; implies either &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq P&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;J \subseteq P.&lt;/math&gt; This latter formulation illustrates the idea of ideals as generalizations of elements.

=== Homomorphism ===
{{main|Ring homomorphism}}
A '''[[ring homomorphism|homomorphism]]''' from a ring (''R'', +, '''·''') to a ring (''S'', ‡, *) is a function ''f'' from ''R'' to ''S'' that preserves the ring operations; namely, such that, for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''R'' the following identities hold:

* ''f''(''a'' + ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') ‡ ''f''(''b'')
* ''f''(''a'' '''·''' ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') * ''f''(''b'')
* ''f''(1&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;

If one is working with not necessarily unital rings, then the third condition is dropped.

A ring homomorphism is said to be an '''[[isomorphism]]''' if there exists an inverse homomorphism to ''f'' (i.e., a ring homomorphism which is an [[inverse function]]). Any [[bijection|bijective]] ring homomorphism is a ring isomorphism. Two rings &lt;math&gt;R, S&lt;/math&gt; are said to be isomorphic if there is an isomorphism between them and in that case one writes &lt;math&gt;R \simeq S&lt;/math&gt;. A ring homomorphism between the same ring is called an endomorphism and an isomorphism between the same ring an automorphism.

Examples:
* The function that maps each integer ''x'' to its remainder modulo 4 (a number in {0, 1, 2, 3}) is a homomorphism from the ring '''Z''' to the quotient ring '''Z'''/4'''Z''' ("quotient ring" is defined below).
* If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a unit element in a ring ''R'', then &lt;math&gt;R \to R, x \mapsto uxu^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a ring homomorphism, called an [[inner automorphism]] of ''R''.
* Let ''R'' be a commutative ring of prime characteristic ''p''. Then &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x^p&lt;/math&gt; is a ring endomorphism of ''R'' called the [[Frobenius homomorphism]].
* The [[Galois group]] of a field extension &lt;math&gt;L/K&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all automorphisms of ''L'' whose restrictions to ''K'' are the identity.
* For any ring ''R'', there are a unique ring homomorphism '''Z''' → ''R'' and a unique ring homomorphism ''R'' → 0.
* An [[epimorphism]] (i.e., right-cancelable morphism) of rings need not be surjective. For example, the unique map &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is an epimorphism.
* An algebra homomorphism from a ''k''-algebra to the [[endomorphism algebra]] of a vector space over ''k'' is called a [[algebra representation|representation of the algebra]].

Given a ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f:R \to S&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all elements mapped to 0 by ''f'' is called the [[kernel of a ring homomorphism|kernel]] of ''f''. The kernel is a two-sided ideal of ''R''. The image of ''f'', on the other hand, is not always an ideal, but it is always a subring of ''S''.

To give a ring homomorphism from a commutative ring ''R'' to a ring ''A'' with image contained in the center of ''A'' is the same as to give a structure of an [[associative algebra|algebra]] over ''R'' to ''A'' (in particular gives a structure of ''A''-module).

=== Quotient ring ===
{{main|Quotient ring}}
The '''[[quotient ring]]''' of a ring, is analogous to the notion of a [[quotient group]] of a group. More formally, given a ring (''R'', +, '''·''' ) and a [[Ideal (ring theory)|two-sided ideal]] ''I'' of (''R'', +, '''·''' ), the '''quotient ring''' (or '''factor ring''') ''R/I'' is the set of cosets of ''I'' (with respect to the [[additive group]] of (''R'', +, '''·''' ); i.e. cosets with respect to (''R'', +)) together with the operations:

:(''a'' + ''I'') + (''b'' + ''I'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''I'' and
:(''a'' + ''I'')(''b'' + ''I'') = (''ab'') + ''I''.

for every ''a'', ''b'' in ''R''.

Like the case of a quotient group, there is a canonical map &lt;math&gt;p: R \to R/I&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x + I&lt;/math&gt;. It is surjective and satisfies the universal property: if &lt;math&gt;f:R \to S&lt;/math&gt; is a ring homomorphism such that &lt;math&gt;f(I) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a unique &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}: R/I \to S&lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt;f = \overline{f} \circ p&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, taking ''I'' to be the kernel, one sees that the quotient ring &lt;math&gt;R / \operatorname{ker} f&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the image of ''f''; the fact known as the first [[isomorphism theorem]]. The last fact implies that actually ''any'' surjective ring homomorphism satisfies the universal property since the image of such a map is a quotient ring.
&lt;!-- need more work: A subset of ''R'' and the quotient &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; are related in the following way. A subset of ''R'' is called a [[system of representatives]] of &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; if no two elements in the set belong to the same coset; i.e., each element in the set represents a unique coset. It is said to be complete if the restriction of &lt;math&gt;R \to R/I&lt;/math&gt; to it is surjective. --&gt;

== Module ==
{{main|Module (mathematics)}}

The concept of a ''module over a ring'' generalizes the concept of a [[vector space]] (over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]) by generalizing from multiplication of vectors with elements of a field ([[scalar multiplication]]) to multiplication with elements of a ring. More precisely, given a ring {{math|''R''}} with 1, an {{math|''R''}}-module {{math|''M''}} is an [[abelian group]] equipped with an [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] {{math|''R'' &amp;times; ''M'' → ''M''}} (associating an element of {{math|''M''}} to every pair of an element of {{math|''R''}} and an element of {{math|''M''}}) that satisfies certain [[axiom#Non-logical axioms|axioms]]. This operation is commonly denoted multiplicatively and called multiplication. The axioms of modules are the following: for all {{math|''a'', ''b''}} in {{math|''R''}} and all {{math|''x'', ''y''}} in {{math|''M''}}, we have:
* {{math|''M''}} is an abelian group under addition.
* &lt;math&gt;a(x+y)=ax+ay&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a+b)x=ax+bx&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1x=x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(ab)x=a(bx)&lt;/math&gt;
When the ring is [[noncommutative ring|noncommutative]] these axioms define ''left modules''; ''right modules'' are defined similarly by writing {{math|''xa''}} instead of {{math|''ax''}}. This is not only a change of notation, as the last axiom of right modules (that is {{math|1=''x''(''ab'') = (''xa'')''b''}}) becomes {{math|1=(''ab'')''x'' = ''b''(''ax'')}}, if left multiplication (by ring elements) is used for a right module.

Basic examples of modules are ideals, including the ring itself.

Although similarly defined, the theory of modules is much more complicated than that of vector space, mainly, because, unlike vector spaces, modules are not characterized (up to an isomorphism) by a single invariant (the [[dimension (vector space)|dimension of a vector space]]). In particular, not all modules have a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].

The axioms of modules imply that {{math|1=(−1)''x'' = −''x''}}, where the first minus denotes the [[additive inverse]] in the ring and the second minus the additive inverse in the module. Using this and denoting repeated addition by a multiplication by a positive integer allows identifying abelian groups with modules over the ring of integers.

Any ring homomorphism induces a structure of a module: if {{math|''f'' : ''R'' → ''S''}} is a ring homomorphism, then {{math|''S''}} is a left module over {{math|''R''}} by the multiplication: {{nowrap|1=''rs'' = ''f''(''r'')''s''}}. If {{math|''R''}} is commutative or if {{math|''f''(''R'')}} is contained in the [[center of a ring|center]] of {{math|''S''}}, the ring {{math|''S''}} is called a {{math|''R''}}-[[algebra over a ring|algebra]]. In particular, every ring is an algebra over the integers.

== Constructions ==

=== Direct product ===
{{Main|Direct product of rings}}

Let ''R'' and ''S'' be rings. Then the [[cartesian product|product]] {{nowrap|''R'' × ''S''}} can be equipped with the following natural ring structure:

* (''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) + (''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
* (''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ⋅ (''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

for every ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in ''R'' and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in ''S''. The ring {{nowrap|''R'' × ''S''}} with the above operations of addition and multiplication and the multiplicative identity &lt;math&gt;(1, 1)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''[[Direct product of rings|direct product]]''' of ''R'' with ''S''. The same construction also works for an arbitrary family of rings: if &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; are rings indexed by a set ''I'', then &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i \in I} R_i&lt;/math&gt; is a ring with componentwise addition and multiplication.

Let ''R'' be a commutative ring and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_1, \cdots,  \mathfrak{a}_n&lt;/math&gt; be ideals such that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i +  \mathfrak{a}_j = (1)&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;i \ne j&lt;/math&gt;. Then the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] says there is a canonical ring isomorphism:
:&lt;math&gt;R /{\textstyle \bigcap_{i=1}^{n}{\mathfrak{a}_i}} \simeq \prod_{i=1}^{n}{R/ \mathfrak{a}_i}, \qquad x \;\operatorname{mod}\; {\textstyle \bigcap_{i=1}^{n}{\mathfrak{a}_i}} \mapsto (x \;\operatorname{mod}\; \mathfrak{a}_1, \ldots , x \;\operatorname{mod}\; \mathfrak{a}_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

A "finite" direct product may also be viewed as a direct sum of ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohn|2003|loc=Theorem 4.5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Namely, let &lt;math&gt;R_i, 1 \le i \le n&lt;/math&gt; be rings, &lt;math&gt;R_i \to R = \prod R_i&lt;/math&gt; the inclusions with the images &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i&lt;/math&gt; (in particular &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i&lt;/math&gt; are rings though not subrings). Then &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i&lt;/math&gt; are ideals of ''R'' and
:&lt;math&gt;R = \mathfrak{a}_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus  \mathfrak{a}_n, \quad \mathfrak{a}_i \mathfrak{a}_j = 0, i \ne j, \quad \mathfrak{a}_i^2 \subseteq \mathfrak{a}_i&lt;/math&gt;
as a direct sum of abelian groups (because for abelian groups finite products are the same as direct sums). Clearly the direct sum of such ideals also defines a product of rings that is isomorphic to ''R''. Equivalently, the above can be done through [[central idempotent]]s. Assume ''R'' has the above decomposition. Then we can write
:&lt;math&gt;1 = e_1 + \cdots + e_n, \quad e_i \in \mathfrak{a}_i.&lt;/math&gt;
By the conditions on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i&lt;/math&gt;, one has that &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; are central idempotents and &lt;math&gt;e_i e_j = 0, i \ne j&lt;/math&gt; (orthogonal). Again, one can reverse the construction. Namely, if one is given a partition of 1 in orthogonal central idempotents, then let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i = R e_i&lt;/math&gt;, which are two-sided ideals. If each &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; is not a sum of orthogonal central idempotents,&lt;ref&gt;such a central idempotent is called [[centrally primitive]].&lt;/ref&gt; then their direct sum is isomorphic to ''R''.

An important application of an infinite direct product is the construction of a [[projective limit]] of rings (see below). Another application is a [[restricted product]] of a family of rings (cf. [[adele ring]]).

=== Polynomial ring ===
{{main|Polynomial ring}}

Given a symbol ''t'' (called a variable) and a commutative ring ''R'', the set of polynomials

: &lt;math&gt;R[t] = \left\{ a_n t^n + a_{n-1} t^{n -1} + \dots + a_1 t + a_0  \mid n \ge 0, a_j \in R \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

forms a commutative ring with the usual addition and multiplication, containing ''R'' as a subring. It is called the [[polynomial ring]] over ''R''. More generally, the set &lt;math&gt;R[t_1, \ldots, t_n]&lt;/math&gt; of all polynomials in variables &lt;math&gt;t_1, \ldots, t_n&lt;/math&gt; forms a commutative ring, containing &lt;math&gt;R[t_i]&lt;/math&gt; as subrings.

If ''R'' is an integral domain, then &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; is also an integral domain; its field of fractions is the field of [[rational function]]s. If ''R'' is a noetherian ring, then &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; is a noetherian ring. If ''R'' is a unique factorization domain, then &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; is a unique factorization domain. Finally, ''R'' is a field if and only if &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; is a principal ideal domain.

Let &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq S&lt;/math&gt; be commutative rings. Given an element ''x'' of ''S'', one can consider the ring homomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;R[t] \to S, \quad f \mapsto f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
(i.e., the [[Substitution (algebra)|substitution]]). If ''S''=''R''[''t''] and ''x''=''t'', then ''f''(''t'')=''f''. Because of this, the polynomial ''f'' is often also denoted by &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The image of the map &lt;math&gt;f \mapsto f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;R[x]&lt;/math&gt;; it is the same thing as the subring of ''S'' generated by ''R'' and ''x''.

Example: &lt;math&gt;k[t^2, t^3]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the image of the homomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;k[x, y] \to k[t], \, f \mapsto f(t^2, t^3).&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, it is the subalgebra of &lt;math&gt;k[t]&lt;/math&gt; generated by ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Example: let ''f'' be a polynomial in one variable; i.e., an element in a polynomial ring ''R''. Then &lt;math&gt;f(x+h)&lt;/math&gt; is an element in &lt;math&gt;R[h]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x+h) - f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by ''h'' in that ring. The result of substituting zero to ''h'' in &lt;math&gt;(f(x+h) - f(x))/h&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;, the derivative of ''f'' at ''x''.

The substitution is a special case of the universal property of a polynomial ring. The property states: given a ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi: R \to S&lt;/math&gt; and an element ''x'' in ''S'' there exists a unique ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\overline{\phi}: R[t] \to S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\overline{\phi}(t) = x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; restricts to &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobson|1974|loc=Theorem 2.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, choosing a basis, a [[symmetric algebra]] satisfies the universal property and so is a polynomial ring.

To give an example, let ''S'' be the ring of all functions from ''R'' to itself; the addition and the multiplication are those of functions. Let ''x'' be the identity function. Each ''r'' in ''R'' defines a constant function, giving rise to the homomorphism &lt;math&gt;R \to S&lt;/math&gt;. The universal property says that this map extends uniquely to
:&lt;math&gt;R[t] \to S, \quad f \mapsto \overline{f}&lt;/math&gt;
(''t'' maps to ''x'') where &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[polynomial function]] defined by ''f''. The resulting map is injective if and only if ''R'' is infinite.

Given a non-constant monic polynomial ''f'' in &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a ring ''S'' containing ''R'' such that ''f'' is a product of linear factors in &lt;math&gt;S[t]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|Algèbre commutative|loc=Ch 5. §1, Lemma 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''k'' be an algebraically closed field. The [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]] (theorem of zeros) states that there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between the set of all prime ideals in &lt;math&gt;k[t_1, \ldots, t_n]&lt;/math&gt; and the set of closed subvarieties of &lt;math&gt;k^n&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, many local problems in algebraic geometry may be attacked through the study of the generators of an ideal in a polynomial ring. (cf. [[Gröbner basis]].)

There are some other related constructions. A [[formal power series ring]] &lt;math&gt;R[\![t]\!]&lt;/math&gt; consists of formal power series
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_0^\infty a_i t^i, \quad a_i \in R&lt;/math&gt;
together with multiplication and addition that mimic those for convergent series. It contains &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; as a subring. Note a formal power series ring does not have the universal property of a polynomial ring; a series may not converge after a substitution. The important advantage of a formal power series ring over a polynomial ring is that it is [[local ring|local]] (in fact, [[complete ring|complete]]).

=== Matrix ring and endomorphism ring ===
{{Main|Matrix ring|Endomorphism ring}}

Let ''R'' be a ring (not necessarily commutative). The set of all square matrices of size ''n'' with entries in ''R'' forms a ring with the entry-wise addition and the usual [[matrix multiplication]]. It is called the [[matrix ring]] and is denoted by M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''). Given a right ''R''-module &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all ''R''-linear maps from ''U'' to itself forms a ring with addition that is of function and multiplication that is of [[composition of functions]]; it is called the endomorphism ring of ''U'' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(U)&lt;/math&gt;.

As in linear algebra, a matrix ring may be canonically interpreted as an endomorphism ring: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(R^n) \simeq \operatorname{M}_n(R)&lt;/math&gt;. This is a special case of the following fact: If &lt;math&gt;f: \oplus_1^n U \to \oplus_1^n U&lt;/math&gt; is an ''R''-linear map, then ''f'' may be written as a matrix with entries &lt;math&gt;f_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S = \operatorname{End}_R(U)&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in the ring isomorphism:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(\oplus_1^n U) \to \operatorname{M}_n(S), \quad f \mapsto (f_{ij}).&lt;/math&gt;

Any ring homomorphism ''R'' → ''S'' induces {{nowrap|M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') → M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')}}; in fact, any ring homomorphism between matrix rings arises in this way.&lt;ref name="Cohn matrix"&gt;{{harvnb|Cohn|2003|loc=4.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Schur's lemma]] says that if ''U'' is a simple right ''R''-module, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(U)&lt;/math&gt; is a division ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lang|2002|loc=Ch. XVII. Proposition 1.1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle U = \bigoplus_{i = 1}^r U_i^{\oplus m_i}&lt;/math&gt; is a direct sum of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;-copies of simple ''R''-modules &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}_R(U) \simeq \bigoplus_1^r \operatorname{M}_{m_i} (\operatorname{End}_R(U_i))&lt;/math&gt;.
The [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]] states any [[semisimple ring]] (cf. below) is of this form.

A ring ''R'' and the matrix ring M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') over it are [[Morita equivalent]]: the category of right modules of ''R'' is equivalent to the category of right modules over M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'').&lt;ref name="Cohn matrix" /&gt; In particular, two-sided ideals in ''R'' correspond in one-to-one to two-sided ideals in M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'').

Examples:
* The automorphisms of the [[projective line over a ring]] are given by [[homography|homographies]] from the 2 x 2 matrix ring.

=== Limits and colimits of rings ===
Let ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be a sequence of rings such that ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a subring of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''i''. Then the union (or [[filtered colimit]]) of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ring &lt;math&gt;\varinjlim R_i&lt;/math&gt; defined as follows: it is the disjoint union of all ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s modulo the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;x \sim y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt; in ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for sufficiently large ''i''.

Examples of colimits:
* A polynomial ring in infinitely many variables: &lt;math&gt;R[t_1, t_2, \cdots] = \varinjlim R[t_1, t_2, \cdots, t_m].&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[algebraic closure]] of [[finite field]]s of the same characteristic &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbf{F}}_p = \varinjlim \mathbf{F}_{p^m}.&lt;/math&gt;
* The field of [[formal Laurent series]] over a field ''k'': &lt;math&gt;k(\!(t)\!) = \varinjlim t^{-m}k[\![t]\!]&lt;/math&gt; (it is the field of fractions of the [[formal power series ring]] &lt;math&gt;k[\![t]\!]&lt;/math&gt;.)
* The [[function field of an algebraic variety]] over a field ''k'' is &lt;math&gt;\varinjlim k[U]&lt;/math&gt; where the limit runs over all the coordinate rings &lt;math&gt;k[U]&lt;/math&gt; of nonempty open subsets ''U'' (more succinctly it is the [[stalk (mathematics)|stalk]] of the structure sheaf at the [[generic point]].)

Any commutative ring is the colimit of [[finitely generated ring|finitely generated subrings]].&lt;!-- non-commutative case? --&gt;

A [[projective limit]] (or a [[filtered limit]]) of rings is defined as follows. Suppose we're given a family of rings &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;, ''i'' running over positive integers, say, and ring homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;R_j \to R_i, j \ge i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;R_i \to R_i&lt;/math&gt; are all the identities and &lt;math&gt;R_k \to R_j \to R_i&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;R_k \to R_i&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;k \ge j \ge i&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\varprojlim R_i&lt;/math&gt; is the subring of &lt;math&gt;\prod R_i&lt;/math&gt; consisting of &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; maps to &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;R_j \to R_i, j \ge i&lt;/math&gt;.

For an example of a projective limit, see {{slink||Completion}}.

=== Localization ===
The [[localization of a ring|localization]] generalizes the construction of the [[field of fractions]] of an integral domain to an arbitrary ring and modules. Given a (not necessarily commutative) ring ''R'' and a subset ''S'' of ''R'', there exists a ring &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; together with the ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;R \to R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; that "inverts" ''S''; that is, the homomorphism maps elements in ''S'' to unit elements in &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;, and, moreover, any ring homomorphism from ''R'' that "inverts" ''S'' uniquely factors through &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohn|1995|loc=Proposition 1.3.1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ring &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''localization''' of ''R'' with respect to ''S''. For example, if ''R'' is a commutative ring and ''f'' an element in ''R'', then the localization &lt;math&gt;R[f^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; consists of elements of the form &lt;math&gt;r/f^n, \, r \in R , \, n \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; (to be precise, &lt;math&gt;R[f^{-1}] = R[t]/(tf - 1).&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenbud|2004|loc=Exercise 2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The localization is frequently applied to a commutative ring ''R'' with respect to the complement of a prime ideal (or a union of prime ideals) in ''R''. In that case &lt;math&gt;S = R - \mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;, one often writes &lt;math&gt;R_\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;R_\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; is then a local ring with the maximal ideal &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p} R_\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;. This is the reason for the terminology "localization". The field of fractions of an integral domain ''R'' is the localization of ''R'' at the prime ideal zero. If
&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; is a prime ideal of a commutative ring ''R'', then the field of fractions of &lt;math&gt;R/\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the residue field of the local ring &lt;math&gt;R_\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;k(\mathfrak{p})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;!-- In algebraic geometry, the field of fractions is the localization at the "[[generic point]]" --&gt;

If ''M'' is a left ''R''-module, then the localization of ''M'' with respect to ''S'' is given by a [[change of rings]] &lt;math&gt;M[S^{-1}] = R[S^{-1}] \otimes_R M&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;!-- intuitively, M_p corresponds to the fiber over ''p'' in ''M''. In particular, there is the canonical map &lt;math&gt;M \to M[S^{-1}], \, m \mapsto m / 1&lt;/math&gt;. Its kernel consists of elements ''m'' such that &lt;math&gt;sm = 0&lt;/math&gt; for some ''s'' in ''S''. --&gt;

The most important properties of localization are the following: when ''R'' is a commutative ring and ''S'' a multiplicatively closed subset
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p} \mapsto \mathfrak{p}[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection between the set of all prime ideals in ''R'' disjoint from ''S'' and the set of all prime ideals in &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milne|2012|loc=Proposition 6.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}] = \varinjlim R[f^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;, ''f'' running over elements in ''S'' with partial ordering given by divisibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milne|2012|loc=The end of Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The localization is exact:
*: &lt;math&gt;0 \to M'[S^{-1}] \to M[S^{-1}] \to M''[S^{-1}] \to 0&lt;/math&gt; is exact over &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0&lt;/math&gt; is exact over ''R''.
* Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;0 \to M'_\mathfrak{m} \to M_\mathfrak{m} \to M''_\mathfrak{m} \to 0&lt;/math&gt; is exact for any maximal ideal &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0&lt;/math&gt; is exact.
* A remark: localization is no help in proving a global existence. One instance of this is that if two modules are isomorphic at all prime ideals, it does not follow that they are isomorphic. (One way to explain this is that the localization allows one to view a module as a sheaf over prime ideals and a sheaf is inherently a local notion.)

In category theory, a [[localization of a category]] amounts to making some morphisms isomorphisms. An element in a commutative ring ''R'' may be thought of as an endomorphism of any ''R''-module. Thus, categorically, a localization of ''R'' with respect to a subset ''S'' of ''R'' is a functor from the category of ''R''-modules to itself that sends elements of ''S'' viewed as endomorphisms to automorphisms and is universal with respect to this property. (Of course, ''R'' then maps to &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; and ''R''-modules map to &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;-modules.)

=== Completion ===
Let ''R'' be a commutative ring, and let ''I'' be an ideal of ''R''.
The '''[[Completion (ring theory)|completion]]''' of ''R'' at ''I'' is the projective limit &lt;math&gt;\hat{R} = \varprojlim R/I^n&lt;/math&gt;; it is a commutative ring. The canonical homomorphisms from ''R'' to the quotients &lt;math&gt;R/I^n&lt;/math&gt; induce a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;R \to \hat{R}&lt;/math&gt;. The latter homomorphism is injective if ''R'' is a noetherian integral domain and ''I'' is a proper ideal, or if ''R'' is a noetherian local ring with maximal ideal ''I'', by [[Krull's intersection theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;Atiyah and Macdonald, Theorem 10.17 and its corollaries.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction is especially useful when ''I'' is a maximal ideal.

The basic example is the completion '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; of '''Z''' at the principal ideal (''p'') generated by a prime number ''p''; it is called the ring of [[p-adic integer|''p''-adic integers]]. The completion can in this case be constructed also from the [[p-adic absolute value|''p''-adic absolute value]] on '''Q'''. The ''p''-adic absolute value on '''Q''' is a map &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto |x|&lt;/math&gt; from '''Q''' to '''R''' given by &lt;math&gt;|n|_p=p^{-v_p(n)}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;v_p(n)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the exponent of ''p'' in the prime factorization of a nonzero integer ''n'' into prime numbers (we also put &lt;math&gt;|0|_p=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|m/n|_p = |m|_p/|n|_p&lt;/math&gt;). It defines a distance function on '''Q''' and the completion of '''Q''' as a [[metric space]] is denoted by '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. It is again a field since the field operations extend to the completion. The subring of '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; consisting of elements ''x'' with &lt;math&gt;|x|_p \le 1&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Similarly, the formal power series ring &lt;math&gt;R[{[t]}]&lt;/math&gt; is the completion of &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;(t)&lt;/math&gt; (see also [[Hensel's lemma]])&lt;!-- need to be discussed with concrete examples. Start of a para: The notion of the completion formalizes the construction of a solution by successive approximation. --&gt;

A complete ring has much simpler structure than a commutative ring. This owns to the [[Cohen structure theorem]], which says, roughly, that a complete local ring tends to look like a formal power series ring or a quotient of it. On the other hand, the interaction between the [[integral closure]] and completion has been among the most important aspects that distinguish modern commutative ring theory from the classical one developed by the likes of Noether. Pathological examples found by Nagata led to the reexamination of the roles of Noetherian rings and motivated, among other things, the definition of [[excellent ring]].

=== Rings with generators and relations ===
The most general way to construct a ring is by specifying generators and relations. Let ''F'' be a [[free ring]] (i.e., free algebra over the integers) with the set ''X'' of symbols; i.e., ''F'' consists of polynomials with integral coefficients in noncommuting variables that are elements of ''X''. A free ring satisfies the universal property: any function from the set ''X'' to a ring ''R'' factors through ''F'' so that &lt;math&gt;F \to R&lt;/math&gt; is the unique ring homomorphism. Just as in the group case, every ring can be represented as a quotient of a free ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohn|1995|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=u-4ADgUgpSMC&amp;pg=PA242 pg. 242]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, we can impose relations among symbols in ''X'' by taking a quotient. Explicitly, if ''E'' is a subset of ''F'', then the quotient ring of ''F'' by the ideal generated by ''E'' is called the ring with generators ''X'' and relations ''E''. If we used a ring, say, ''A'' as a base ring instead of '''Z''', then the resulting ring will be over ''A''. For example, if &lt;math&gt;E = \{ xy - yx \mid x, y \in X \}&lt;/math&gt;, then the resulting ring will be the usual polynomial ring with coefficients in ''A'' in variables that are elements of ''X'' (It is also the same thing as the [[symmetric algebra]] over ''A'' with symbols ''X''.)

In the category-theoretic terms, the formation &lt;math&gt;S \mapsto \text{the free ring generated by the set } S&lt;/math&gt; is the left adjoint functor of the [[forgetful functor]] from the category of rings to '''Set''' (and it is often called the free ring functor.)&lt;!-- Note: we need to discuss a ring as a solution to a universal problem with some specific application. --&gt;

Let ''A'', ''B'' be algebras over a commutative ring ''R''. Then the tensor product of ''R''-modules &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_R B&lt;/math&gt; is a ''R''-module. We can turn it to a ring by extending linearly &lt;math&gt;(x \otimes u) (y \otimes v) = xy \otimes uv&lt;/math&gt;. See also: [[tensor product of algebras]], [[change of rings]].

== Special kinds of rings ==

=== Domains ===
A [[zero ring|nonzero]] ring with no nonzero [[zero-divisor]]s is called a [[domain (ring theory)|domain]]. A commutative domain is called an [[integral domain]]. The most important integral domains are principal ideals domains, PID for short, and fields. A principal ideal domain is an integral domain in which every ideal is principal. An important class of integral domains that contain a PID is a [[unique factorization domain]] (UFD), an integral domain in which every nonunit element is a product of [[prime element]]s (an element is prime if it generates a [[prime ideal]].) The fundamental question in [[algebraic number theory]] is on the extent to which the [[ring of integers|ring of (generalized) integers]] in a [[number field]], where an "ideal" admits prime factorization, fails to be a PID.

Among theorems concerning a PID, the most important one is the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]]. The theorem may be illustrated by the following application to linear algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lang|2002|loc=Ch XIV, §2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''V'' be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field ''k'' and &lt;math&gt;f: V \to V&lt;/math&gt; a linear map with minimal polynomial ''q''. Then, since &lt;math&gt;k[t]&lt;/math&gt; is a unique factorization domain, ''q'' factors into powers of distinct irreducible polynomials (i.e., prime elements):
:&lt;math&gt;q = p_1^{e_1} ... p_s^{e_s}.&lt;/math&gt;
Letting &lt;math&gt;t \cdot v = f(v)&lt;/math&gt;, we make ''V'' a ''k''[''t'']-module. The structure theorem then says ''V'' is a direct sum of [[cyclic module]]s, each of which is isomorphic to the module of the form &lt;math&gt;k[t]/(p_i^{k_j})&lt;/math&gt;. Now, if &lt;math&gt;p_i(t) = t - \lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;, then such a cyclic module (for &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;) has a basis in which the restriction of ''f'' is represented by a [[Jordan matrix]]. Thus, if, say, ''k'' is algebraically closed, then all &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;'s are of the form &lt;math&gt;t - \lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; and the above decomposition corresponds to the [[Jordan canonical form]] of ''f''.

In algebraic geometry, UFDs arise because of smoothness. More precisely, a point in a variety (over a perfect field) is smooth if the local ring at the point is a [[regular local ring]]. A regular local ring is a UFD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weibel|loc=Ch 1, Theorem 3.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a chain of [[subclass (set theory)|class inclusions]] that describes the relationship between rings, domains and fields:

: '''[[Commutative ring]]s''' ⊃ '''[[integral domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[integrally closed domain]]s''' ⊃'''[[unique factorization domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[principal ideal domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[Euclidean domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[field (mathematics)|fields]]'''

=== Division ring ===
A [[division ring]] is a ring such that every non-zero element is a unit. A commutative division ring is a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. A prominent example of a division ring that is not a field is the ring of [[quaternion]]s. Any centralizer in a division ring is also a division ring. In particular, the center of a division ring is a field. It turned out that every ''finite'' domain (in particular finite division ring) is a field; in particular commutative (the [[Wedderburn's little theorem]]).

Every module over a division ring is a free module (has a basis); consequently, much of linear algebra can be carried out over a division ring instead of a field.

The study of conjugacy classes figures prominently in the classical theory of division rings. Cartan famously asked the following question: given a division ring ''D'' and a proper sub-division-ring ''S'' that is not contained in the center, does each inner automorphism of ''D'' restrict to an automorphism of ''S''? The answer is negative: this is the [[Cartan–Brauer–Hua theorem]].
&lt;!-- need more context. To give a concrete example, we consider a division ring ''D'' whose center ''k'' is the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}_p&lt;/math&gt; of ''p''-adic rational numbers (or more generally a nonarchimedean local field).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milne|CFT|loc=Ch IV, §4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The valuation of ''k'' uniquely extends to any subfield of ''D''. Since ''D'' is a union of subfields, we thus obtain the valuation ''v'' of ''D''. (This has to be verified; it is not a priori obvious that ''v'' is indeed a valuation). Define
:&lt;math&gt;O_D = \{ x \in D | v(x) \ge 0 \}, \quad \mathfrak{P} = \{ x \in D | v(x) &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;O_D&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of ''D'' with the unique maximal ideal that is &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{P}&lt;/math&gt;. It is called the [[ring of integers]] of ''D''.--&gt;

A [[cyclic algebra]], introduced by [[L. E. Dickson]], is a generalization of a [[quaternion algebra]].

=== Semisimple rings ===
A ring is called a [[semisimple ring]] if it is [[semisimple module|semisimple as a left module]] (or right module) over itself; i.e., a direct sum of simple modules. A ring is called a [[semiprimitive ring]] if its [[Jacobson radical]] is zero. (The Jacobson radical is the intersection of all maximal left ideals.) A ring is semisimple if and only if it is [[artinian ring|artinian]] and is semiprimitive.

An algebra over a field ''k'' is artinian if and only if it has finite dimension. Thus, a semisimple algebra over a field is necessarily finite-dimensional, while a simple algebra may have infinite dimension; e.g., the [[ring of differential operators]].

Any module over a semisimple ring is semisimple. (Proof: any free module over a semisimple ring is clearly semisimple and any module is a quotient of a free module.)

Examples of semisimple rings:
* A matrix ring over a division ring is semisimple (actually simple).
* The group ring &lt;math&gt;k[G]&lt;/math&gt; of a finite group ''G'' over a field ''k'' is semisimple if the characteristic of ''k'' does not divide the order of ''G''. ([[Maschke's theorem]])
* The [[Weyl algebra]] (over a field) is a simple ring; it is not semisimple since it has infinite dimension and thus not artinian.
* [[Clifford algebra]]s are semisimple.

Semisimplicity is closely related to separability. An [[algebra over a field|algebra]] ''A'' over a field ''k'' is said to be [[separable algebra|separable]] if the base extension &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_k F&lt;/math&gt; is semisimple for any [[field extension]] &lt;math&gt;F/k&lt;/math&gt;. If ''A'' happens to be a field, then this is equivalent to the usual definition in field theory (cf. [[separable extension]].)

=== Central simple algebra and Brauer group ===
{{main|Central simple algebra}}

For a field ''k'', a ''k''-algebra is central if its center is ''k'' and is simple if it is a [[simple ring]]. Since the center of a simple ''k''-algebra is a field, any simple ''k''-algebra is a central simple algebra over its center. In this section, a central simple algebra is assumed to have finite dimension. Also, we mostly fix the base field; thus, an algebra refers to a ''k''-algebra. The matrix ring of size ''n'' over a ring ''R'' will be denoted by &lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Skolem–Noether theorem]] states any automorphism of a central simple algebra is inner.

Two central simple algebras ''A'' and ''B'' are said to be ''similar'' if there are integers ''n'' and ''m'' such that &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_k k_n \approx B \otimes_k k_m&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Milne|CFT|loc=Ch IV, §2"&gt;{{harvnb|Milne|CFT|loc=Ch IV, §2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since &lt;math&gt;k_n \otimes_k k_m \simeq k_{nm}&lt;/math&gt;, the similarity is an equivalence relation. The similarity classes &lt;math&gt;[A]&lt;/math&gt; with the multiplication &lt;math&gt;[A][B] = [A \otimes_k B]&lt;/math&gt; form an abelian group called the [[Brauer group]] of ''k'' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Br}(k)&lt;/math&gt;. By the [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]], a central simple algebra is the matrix ring of a division ring; thus, each similarity class is represented by a unique division ring.

For example, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Br}(k)&lt;/math&gt; is trivial if ''k'' is a finite field or an algebraically closed field (more generally [[quasi-algebraically closed field]]; cf. [[Tsen's theorem]]). &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Br}(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; has order 2 (a special case of the [[Frobenius theorem (real division algebras)|theorem of Frobenius]]). Finally, if ''k'' is a nonarchimedean [[local field]] (e.g., &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}_p&lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Br}(k) = \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; through the [[Hasse invariant of an algebra|invariant map]].

Now, if ''F'' is a field extension of ''k'', then the base extension &lt;math&gt;- \otimes_k F&lt;/math&gt; induces &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Br}(k) \to \operatorname{Br}(F)&lt;/math&gt;. Its kernel is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Br}(F/k)&lt;/math&gt;. It consists of &lt;math&gt;[A]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_k F&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix ring over ''F'' (i.e., ''A'' is split by ''F''.) If the extension is finite and Galois, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Br}(F/k)&lt;/math&gt; is canonically isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;H^2(\operatorname{Gal}(F/k), k^*)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Serre, J-P ., Applications algébriques de la cohomologie des groupes, I, II, Séminaire Henri Cartan, 1950/51 [http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/feuilleter?id=SHC_1950-1951__3_]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Azumaya algebra]]s generalize the notion of central simple algebras to a commutative local ring.

=== Valuation ring ===
{{main|valuation ring}}

If ''K'' is a field, a [[valuation (algebra)|valuation]] ''v'' is a group homomorphism from the multiplicative group ''K''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; to a totally ordered abelian group ''G'' such that, for any ''f'', ''g'' in ''K'' with ''f'' + ''g'' nonzero, ''v''(''f'' + ''g'') ≥ min{''v''(''f''), ''v''(''g'')}. The [[valuation ring]] of ''v'' is the subring of ''K'' consisting of zero and all nonzero ''f'' such that ''v''(''f'') ≥ 0.

Examples:
* The field of [[formal Laurent series]] &lt;math&gt;k(\!(t)\!)&lt;/math&gt; over a field ''k'' comes with the valuation ''v'' such that ''v''(''f'') is the least degree of a nonzero term in ''f''; the valuation ring of ''v'' is the [[formal power series ring]] &lt;math&gt;k[\![t]\!]&lt;/math&gt;.
* More generally, given a field ''k'' and a totally ordered abelian group ''G'', let &lt;math&gt;k(\!(G)\!)&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all functions from ''G'' to ''k'' whose supports (the sets of points at which the functions are nonzero) are [[well ordered]]. It is a field with the multiplication given by [[convolution]]:
*: &lt;math&gt;(f*g)(t) = \sum_{s \in G} f(s)g(t-s)&lt;/math&gt;.
:It also comes with the valuation ''v'' such that ''v''(''f'') is the least element in the support of ''f''. The subring consisting of elements with finite support is called the [[group ring]] of ''G'' (which makes sense even if ''G'' is not commutative). If ''G'' is the ring of integers, then we recover the previous example (by identifying ''f'' with the series whose ''n''-th coefficient is ''f''(''n'').)

== Rings with extra structure ==

A ring may be viewed as an [[abelian group]] (by using the addition operation), with extra structure: namely, ring multiplication. In the same way, there are other mathematical objects which may be considered as rings with extra structure. For example:
* An [[associative algebra]] is a ring that is also a [[vector space]] over a field ''K'' such that the scalar multiplication distributes over the ring multiplication. For instance, the set of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices over the real field '''R''' has dimension ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as a real vector space.
* A ring ''R'' is a [[topological ring]] if its set of elements ''R'' is given a [[topological space|topology]] which makes the addition map ( &lt;math&gt;+ : R\times R \to R\,&lt;/math&gt;) and the multiplication map ( &lt;math&gt;\cdot : R\times R \to R\,&lt;/math&gt;) to be both [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] as maps between topological spaces (where ''X'' × ''X'' inherits the [[product topology]] or any other product in the category). For example, ''n''-by-''n'' matrices over the real numbers could be given either the [[Euclidean topology]], or the [[Zariski topology]], and in either case one would obtain a topological ring.
* A [[λ-ring]] is a commutative ring ''R'' together with operations λ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;: ''R'' → ''R'' that are like ''n''-th [[exterior power]]s:
::&lt;math&gt;\lambda^n(x + y) = \sum_0^n \lambda^i(x) \lambda^{n-i}(y)&lt;/math&gt;.
:For example, '''Z''' is a λ-ring with &lt;math&gt;\lambda^n(x) = \binom{x}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[binomial coefficient]]s. The notion plays a central rule in the algebraic approach to the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]].
* A [[totally ordered ring]] is a ring with a [[total ordering]] that is compatible with ring operations.&lt;!-- Z is characterized as a certain unique ordered ring. Can’t remember the precise statement.--&gt;

== Some examples of the ubiquity of rings ==

Many different kinds of [[mathematical object]]s can be fruitfully analyzed in terms of some [[functor|associated ring]].

=== Cohomology ring of a topological space ===
To any [[topological space]] ''X'' one can associate its integral [[cohomology ring]]
:&lt;math&gt;H^*(X,\mathbb{Z}) = \bigoplus_{i=0}^{\infty} H^i(X,\mathbb{Z}),&lt;/math&gt;
a [[graded ring]]. There are also [[homology group]]s &lt;math&gt;H_i(X,\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt; of a space, and indeed these were defined first, as a useful tool for distinguishing between certain pairs of topological spaces, like the [[sphere]]s and [[torus|tori]], for which the methods of [[point-set topology]] are not well-suited. [[Cohomology group]]s were later defined in terms of homology groups in a way which is roughly analogous to the dual of a [[vector space]]. To know each individual integral homology group is essentially the same as knowing each individual integral cohomology group, because of the [[universal coefficient theorem]]. However, the advantage of the cohomology groups is that there is a [[cup product|natural product]], which is analogous to the observation that one can multiply pointwise a ''k''-[[multilinear form]] and an ''l''-multilinear form to get a (''k'' + ''l'')-multilinear form.

The ring structure in cohomology provides the foundation for [[characteristic class]]es of [[fiber bundle]]s, intersection theory on manifolds and [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], [[Schubert calculus]] and much more.

=== Burnside ring of a group ===
To any [[group (mathematics)|group]] is associated its [[Burnside ring]] which uses a ring to describe the various ways the group can [[group action|act]] on a finite set. The Burnside ring's additive group is the [[free abelian group]] whose basis are the transitive actions of the group and whose addition is the disjoint union of the action. Expressing an action in terms of the basis is decomposing an action into its transitive constituents. The multiplication is easily expressed in terms of the [[representation ring]]: the multiplication in the Burnside ring is formed by writing the tensor product of two permutation modules as a permutation module. The ring structure allows a formal way of subtracting one action from another. Since the Burnside ring is contained as a finite index subring of the representation ring, one can pass easily from one to the other by extending the coefficients from integers to the rational numbers.

=== Representation ring of a group ring ===
To any [[group ring]] or [[Hopf algebra]] is associated its [[representation ring]] or "Green ring". The representation ring's additive group is the free abelian group whose basis are the indecomposable modules and whose addition corresponds to the direct sum. Expressing a module in terms of the basis is finding an indecomposable decomposition of the module. The multiplication is the tensor product. When the algebra is semisimple, the representation ring is just the character ring from [[character theory]], which is more or less the [[Grothendieck group]] given a ring structure.

=== Function field of an irreducible algebraic variety ===
To any irreducible [[algebraic variety]] is associated its [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]]. The points of an algebraic variety correspond to [[valuation ring]]s contained in the function field and containing the [[coordinate ring]]. The study of [[algebraic geometry]] makes heavy use of [[commutative algebra]] to study geometric concepts in terms of ring-theoretic properties. [[Birational geometry]] studies maps between the subrings of the function field.

=== Face ring of a simplicial complex ===
Every [[simplicial complex]] has an associated face ring, also called its [[Stanley–Reisner ring]]. This ring reflects many of the combinatorial properties of the simplicial complex, so it is of particular interest in [[algebraic combinatorics]]. In particular, the algebraic geometry of the Stanley–Reisner ring was used to characterize the numbers of faces in each dimension of [[simplicial polytope]]s.

== Category theoretical description ==
{{main|Category of rings}}

Every ring can be thought of as a [[monoid (category theory)|monoid]] in '''Ab''', the [[category of abelian groups]] (thought of as a [[monoidal category]] under the [[tensor product of abelian groups|tensor product of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb Z}&lt;/math&gt;-modules]]). The monoid action of a ring ''R'' on an abelian group is simply an [[module (mathematics)|''R''-module]]. Essentially, an ''R''-module is a generalization of the notion of a [[vector space]] – where rather than a vector space over a field, one has a "vector space over a ring".

Let (''A'', +) be an abelian group and let End(''A'') be its [[endomorphism ring]] (see above). Note that, essentially, End(''A'') is the set of all morphisms of ''A'', where if ''f'' is in End(''A''), and ''g'' is in End(''A''), the following rules may be used to compute ''f'' + ''g'' and ''f'' '''·''' ''g'':

* (''f'' + ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') + ''g''(''x'')
* (''f'' '''·''' ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''g''(''x''))

where + as in ''f''(''x'') + ''g''(''x'') is addition in ''A'', and function composition is denoted from right to left. Therefore, [[functor|associated]] to any abelian group, is a ring. Conversely, given any ring, (''R'', +, '''·''' ), (''R'', +) is an abelian group. Furthermore, for every ''r'' in ''R'', right (or left) multiplication by ''r'' gives rise to a morphism of (''R'', +), by right (or left) distributivity. Let ''A'' = (''R'', +). Consider those [[endomorphism]]s of ''A'', that "factor through" right (or left) multiplication of ''R''. In other words, let End&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') be the set of all morphisms ''m'' of ''A'', having the property that ''m''(''r'' '''·''' ''x'') = ''r'' '''·''' ''m''(''x''). It was seen that every ''r'' in ''R'' gives rise to a morphism of ''A'': right multiplication by ''r''. It is in fact true that this association of any element of ''R'', to a morphism of ''A'', as a function from ''R'' to End&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''), is an isomorphism of rings. In this sense, therefore, any ring can be viewed as the endomorphism ring of some abelian ''X''-group (by ''X''-group, it is meant a group with ''X'' being its [[Group with operators|set of operators]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 162, Theorem 3.2.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the most general form of a ring, is the endomorphism group of some abelian ''X''-group.

Any ring can be seen as a [[preadditive category]] with a single object. It is therefore natural to consider arbitrary preadditive categories to be generalizations of rings. And indeed, many definitions and theorems originally given for rings can be translated to this more general context. [[Additive functor]]s between preadditive categories generalize the concept of ring homomorphism, and ideals in additive categories can be defined as sets of [[morphism]]s closed under addition and under composition with arbitrary morphisms.

== Generalization ==

Algebraists have defined structures more general than rings by weakening or dropping some of ring axioms.

=== Rng ===
A [[rng (algebra)|rng]] is the same as a ring, except that the existence of a [[multiplicative identity]] is not assumed.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonassociative ring ===
A [[nonassociative ring]] is an algebraic structure that satisfies all of the ring axioms except the [[associative property]] and the existence of a [[multiplicative identity]]. A notable example is a [[Lie algebra]]. There exists some structure theory&lt;!-- developed by Jacobson? --&gt; for such algebras that generalizes the analogous results for Lie algebras and associative algebras.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Semiring ===
A [[semiring]] is obtained by weakening the assumption that (''R'',+) is an abelian group to the assumption that (''R'',+) is a commutative monoid, and adding the axiom that 0 · ''a'' = ''a'' · 0 = 0 for all ''a'' in ''R'' (since it no longer follows from the other axioms).

Example: a [[tropical semiring]].

== Other ring-like objects ==

=== Ring object in a category ===
Let ''C'' be a category with finite products. Let pt denote a [[terminal object]] of ''C'' (an empty product). A '''ring object''' in ''C'' is an object ''R'' equipped with morphisms &lt;math&gt;R \times R \stackrel{a}\to R&lt;/math&gt; (addition), &lt;math&gt;R \times R \stackrel{m}\to R&lt;/math&gt; (multiplication), &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pt} \stackrel{0}\to R&lt;/math&gt; (additive identity), &lt;math&gt;R \stackrel{i}\to R&lt;/math&gt; (additive inverse), and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pt} \stackrel{1}\to R&lt;/math&gt; (multiplicative identity) satisfying the usual ring axioms. Equivalently, a ring object is an object ''R'' equipped with a factorization of its functor of points &lt;math&gt;h_R = \operatorname{Hom}(-,R) : C^{\operatorname{op}} \to \mathbf{Sets}&lt;/math&gt; through the category of rings: &lt;math&gt;C^{\operatorname{op}} \to \mathbf{Rings} \stackrel{\textrm{forgetful}}\longrightarrow \mathbf{Sets}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Ring scheme ===
In algebraic geometry, a '''ring scheme''' over a base [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] {{math|''S''}} is a ring object in the category of {{math|''S''}}-schemes. One example is the ring scheme {{math|W&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} over {{math|Spec '''Z'''}}, which for any commutative ring {{math|''A''}} returns the ring {{math|W&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'')}} of {{math|''p''}}-isotypic Witt vectors of length {{math|''n''}} over {{math|''A''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Serre, p.&amp;nbsp;44.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ring spectrum ===
In [[algebraic topology]], a [[ring spectrum]] is a [[spectrum (topology)|spectrum]] ''X'' together with a multiplication &lt;math&gt;\mu \colon X \wedge X \to X&lt;/math&gt; and a unit map &lt;math&gt;S \to X&lt;/math&gt; from the [[sphere spectrum]] ''S'', such that the ring axiom diagrams commute up to homotopy. In practice, it is common to define a ring spectrum as a [[monoid object]] in a good category of spectra such as the category of [[symmetric spectrum|symmetric spectra]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6444">The rod and frame test is a [[psychophysics|psychophysical]] method of testing [[perception]]. It relies on the use of a rod and frame apparatus which uses a rotating rod set inside an individually rotatable drum, allowing an experimenter to vary the participant's frame of reference and thus test for their perception of vertical.

==Rod and frame illusion==
[[File:Rod and Frame Apparatus.png|thumb|Picture 1. A picture taken of the Rod and Frame apparatus originally sold by the Stoelting company, and now owned by the Rochester Institute of Technology.]]
Rod and frame illusion occurs because of the effect of the orientation of the frame on the rod. In the simplest example of the rod and frame illusion, the illusion will cause the participant to perceive the rod to be oriented congruent with the orientation of the frame.&lt;ref name=Corbett&gt;Corbett and Ennis. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; When the participant is viewing the rod and frame that are both positioned at 0 degrees (or vertical), he or she perceives the rod as vertical with perfect accuracy. However, when the frame is tilted away from vertical, the participant's perception of vertical is affected. The participant tends to perceive the rod to be tilted in the same direction as the frame is oriented (e.g., if the frame is tilted in the counterclockwise direction, the rod will also be perceived as being tilted counterclockwise). As the tilt of the frame increases, the participants' perceived vertical increasingly deviates from true vertical.

==Rod and frame test==
To perform the rod and frame task, an apparatus consisting of a rod in a square frame is used. An example commercial apparatus can be seen in picture 1. When the participant is being tested using the apparatus, their head is fastened firmly in the chin rest to prevent the participant from collecting visual cues from outside of the apparatus. The rod and frame are shown in the center of the far end of the apparatus, which provides a [[frame of reference]] to the participant. Both the participant and the experimenter are able to adjust the orientation of the rod, while only the experimenter can adjust the frame orientation by using the appropriate knobs on the apparatus, as seen in picture 2. The experimenter is able to see the exact degree measurement of the rod and frame from vertical, while the participant sees the physical rod and frame inside the apparatus. 

The methods of constant stimuli, limits, and adjustment can be used to test the participants, but method of limits is most commonly used in research conducted using the rod and frame task.&lt;ref name="Wenderoth"&gt;Wenderoth, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; When using the method of limits, the experimenter sets the orientation of the rod and frame separately and then the participant is asked to adjust the rod orientation until they perceive it to be vertical. Deviation from true vertical can then be determined. Based on which way the frame is tilted, the rod can be viewed as either being tilted in the same direction as the frame (direct effect), or in the opposite direction of the frame (indirect effect).

==Evidence==
[[File:Example of Perceived Vertical.jpg|thumb|Picture 2. An image showing a 10-degree frame angle and a 7-degree rod angle. Observers using the apparatus see the rod as vertically oriented. The frame of the page, image border, etc. make it appear tilted here.]]
The frame of reference with respect to studies of the [[visual system]] refers to perceived reference axes. In the rod and frame illusion, there are a number of things that can influence one's frame of reference. Past research has found that one reason people experience the rod and frame illusion is due to visual-[[Vestibular system|vestibular]] interactions.&lt;ref name=Spinelli&gt;Spinelli, Antonicci, Daini, and Zoccolotti, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when a participant is viewing the rod and frame task while physically tilted, the participant acts as though they are tilted opposite of the orientation of the frame. This suggests that the illusion, in part, is due to the person compensating for their perceived vertical in the direction that is opposite of the frame. Other evidence proposed by researchers that is consistent with this is that, when participants are put on their sides to view the rod and frame task, they rely on their vision when their vestibular and [[proprioceptive]] senses are incongruent with those of their visual senses.&lt;ref name=Corbett/&gt; These findings suggest that the rod and frame illusion is processed in a type of hierarchy, where visual input is at the top, then vestibular cues, and finally proprioceptive cues. In 2010, Lipshits found that, along with this hierarchy of processing, proprioceptive information, as opposed to gravity, is used by the body to determine which way is vertical.&lt;ref name=Lipshits&gt;Lipshits, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Lipshits says that, when we are not able to use vision to determine which way is vertical, we use other cues based on the axis of our head and body.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14190">'''The Summer Community Organization and Political Education (SCOPE)''' Project of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) was a voter registration civil rights initiative conducted from 1965-66 in 120 counties in six southern states.

== Founding ==
While leading the Chatham County Crusade For Voters in Savannah, Georgia, one of many SCLC affiliates across the South, Rev. [[Hosea Williams]], an SCLC aide to SCLC chairman [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]], had been joined by white college students for various short term civil rights projects. From that interracial success, the idea of SCOPE grew to fruition. Dr. King and SCLC decided that there was a need for white college students to journey south to join with local activists. The goals included preparing formerly disenfranchised African Americans for voting, and, if necessary, organizing street demonstrations to help put political pressure on the Congress, should the proposed [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] be met with congressional resistance and stalling by segregationist forces.

In the winter and spring of 1965, the Voting Rights Movement in Selma, Alabama, and the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] were challenging the segregated status quo. During the spring of 1965 Dr. King assigned Williams, SCLC's Director of Voter Registration and Political Education, to lead the SCOPE Project which had been approved by the SCLC executive committee in December 1964. It continued into the Fall of 1965 and Spring of 1966. Some of the white college volunteers returned in the summer of 1966, and a few enrolled in Black southern colleges and continued community organization activities beyond the spring of 1966.

Dr. King announced the SCOPE project in a speech at UCLA on April 27, 1965, and his visit resulted in the recruitment of twenty UCLA students, including the late [[Joel Siegel]], who later became the film critic for [[Good Morning America]], and [[Rick Tuttle]], who worked with Williams and [[Andrew Young]] and spent two months in a Savannah jail as a result of his movement activities. Tuttle’s case won the right to use property bonds for civil rights workers bail. Later he would serve 16 years as Los Angeles City Controller. The SCLC staff sent regional recruitment teams to visit colleges and universities nationwide. Gwendolyn Green, the executive director of the Western Christian Leadership Conference, joined Dr. King at UCLA and was temporarily assigned to the Atlanta office to serve as the Assistant SCOPE director, reporting to Williams and King.

== Youth Volunteers ==

Initially, the SCLC had hoped to recruit 2000 volunteers, but due to the sometimes extreme danger involved with mid-60s civil rights movement in the southern states, college students from the north and west did not respond in the hoped for numbers. Eventually about 500 predominantly white college volunteers—representing nearly 100 universities—were deployed in 90 of the 120 SCOPE Project targeted counties across six southern states.  Some students were re-deployed and assigned to more than one county by Williams, who had received leadership training as a World War II Army Sgt. in General [[George Patton]]'s Black tank brigade and was a combat decorated  veteran.

== Training ==

The SCOPE project began on June 14, 1965,  with a week-long Orientation at [[Morris Brown College]] in Atlanta, which was led by [[Bayard Rustin]], the organizer of the 1963 [[March On Washington]]. The "faculty" for the orientation included: [[Vernon Jordan]] of the [[Urban League]]; Ralph Helstein, president of the meatpackers union; [[John Doar]], Assistant Attorney for Civil Rights); [[Michael Harrington]], author of “The Other America”; civil rights lawyer [[Charles Morgan, Jr.]], as well as Dr. King, Young, Rev. [[Ralph Abernathy]], Junius Griffin, Rev. [[James Bevel]], and others on the SCLC Executive Staff.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford University "Project South" SCOPE interview archives, Green Llibrary Special Collections&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activist Accomplishments ==
The students were led by local African American leaders in the targeted counties and joined by Black community volunteers, including local ministers and large numbers of local high school and college youth. The SCOPE Project registered an estimated 49,000 new voters through the combined efforts of the local community and the SCOPE college volunteers during a ten-week initiative, from June 14 - August 28.  In addition, SCOPE educated thousands of citizens in political and voter literacy education classes.
 
The volunteers also tested and reported violations of the [[1964 Civil Rights Act]] and the 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]] to Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, John Doar, which led to U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) investigations and the deployment of Federal voter registrars to counties that denied African Americans the right to vote.  SCLC field staff and SCOPE volunteers also worked with the DOJ [[Community Relations Service]] (CRS), and engaged in nonviolent demonstrations to dramatize the denial of voting rights and the refusal to remove "white only" signs and desegregate public accommodations.

SCLC and other organizations bridged racial and religious barriers to forge partnerships with both white Christian and Jewish groups, along with progressives in the [[Southern Regional Council]] and other organizations. SCOPE volunteers were assigned to work with African-American community leaders who had requested the white college volunteers.
  
The students lived with African-American families, who were paid $15 a week for their room and board, which barely covered expenses. About 40 of the college volunteers were asked by Dr. King, Williams and his assistant, Gwendolyn Green, to join the SCLC Field Staff. They were then paid a subsistence salary of $5 a week, with the African American community providing housing and meals. Many veterans from other SCLC campaigns were assigned to the SCOPE project including: Field Staff members Rev. Willie Bolden, Benjamin Van Clark, Jimmie L. Wells, Lula Williams, Lena Turner, Gloria Wise, Jewell Wise, Patricia Simpson, R. B. Cottonreader, J.T. Johnson, Tom Houck, Dana Swan, Rev. [[James Orange]], Ben “Sunshine” Owens, “Big Lester” Hankerson, Leon Hall, [[Bruce Hartford]], and others. Both Albert Turner and Stony Cooks worked closely with Williams in statewide leadership roles.

SCOPE volunteers experienced violence, tear-gassing, harassment and threats with guns on numerous occasions, according to "incident reports"&lt;ref&gt;Leventhal, Willy. ''The Scope of Freedom: The Leadership of Hosea Williams with Dr. King's '65 Student Volunteers''. (2005) Montgomery: Challenge Publishing, pp. 367-389&lt;/ref&gt; from the project's administrative records. On June 18, 1965 in Camden, AL, for example, 18 SCOPE workers were arrested in a church for "illegal possession of boycott materials." One SCOPE worker, Mike Farley, was beaten in jail by a white prisoner, who was reportedly both bribed and threatened by a jailer. On July 8 in Wilcox County, AL, three cars carrying SCOPE workers were shot at by white men, after police stopped SCOPE workers and spoke with white men. On July 15, in Chatham County, Georgia, SCOPE worker Shirley Savaris was threatened by a white man with a gun and told to leave town. The next day in Taliafferro County, Georgia, SCOPE workers were threatened by a deputy sheriff and county attorney with beatings and killings, "if they did not leave town the next day." Also in Taliaferro County, on July 23, SCOPE volunteer Richard Copeland was beaten by two whites on the courthouse steps in Crawfordsville. On July 28 in Sussex County, Virginia, two SCOPE workers, Gary Imsland and Elke Wiedenroth, were run off the road while returning from a church meeting and threatened by a white man with a shotgun. In Luverne, Alabama, on August 3, SCOPE workers Dunbar Reed, Bruce Hartford, and Carol Richardson, along with a number of local students were attacked and beaten by a white mob after they integrated a local cafe. On August 18 in Berkeley County, South Carolina, two SCOPE volunteers were beaten after attempting to integrate restaurants in Monk's Corner and the local SCOPE office and volunteer residence was shot up the following day.

== SCOPE Veterans Legacy ==
The SCOPE volunteers were profoundly impacted on a personal level by the inter-racial experiences throughout their lives, as were the host families and communities.  Press accounts termed the SCOPE volunteers "the freedom corps." Although the college students were in no way  leaders of the civil rights movement, they were a part of a generational vanguard of about only 3,000 whites between 1961–1966,  who were willing to put themselves in harms way during the movement struggle in the South. Rev. Hosea Williams predicted in an interview with the Stanford University radio station in August, 1965, that SCOPE volunteers would provide significant leadership to America in the future. And, within the ranks of the SCOPE students there have been many who provided impressive leadership in various fields, including: Dr. [[Jo Freeman]], an author/journalist; Father [[James Groppi]], as an activist Catholic priest; Dr. Barbara Jean Emerson, a college administrator; [[Elizabeth Omilami]], actress and current CEO of Hosea's Feed The Hungry and Homeless  Inc - a non-profit that provides food and assistance to the poor in Atlanta; Rabbi Moshe Shur, Hillel Rabbi at Queens College; international educator Peter Geffen, founder of the [[Abraham Heschel]] Day School in NYC; Dr. Dean Savage, chair, Dept of Sociology, Queens College;, Dr. James Simons, M.D., Oncologist, Kaiser Hospital, Oakland, CA;, Judy Van Allen (Institute For African Development, Cornell University; Dick Reavis, professor, NC State University); Dr. Bruce Mirhoff, professor, SUNY); Bruce Hartford, co-founder Civil Rights Vets website; Beth Pickens, attorney – NYC and others. Additional SCOPErs who became leaders can be found on the civil rights vets website.

[[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) Chairman from 1963–1966 (later a U.S. Congressman representing Atlanta), welcomed the SCOPE volunteers as “Brothers and sisters in the movement,” who were willing to put their lives on the line for freedom. Lewis was jailed with white SCOPE workers, along with local African American SNCC and SCLC volunteers, in Americus, Georgia on August 1, 1965, after attempting to integrate to local churches. As Lewis said during a question and answer session at Atlanta's Oglethorpe University in 2006, "The SCOPE volunteers were no different than [[Freedom Summer]] workers, we were all together that summer of 1965, and we all took the same risks.  The SCOPE volunteers stood shoulder to shoulder with us in our struggle for civil and voting rights."

In assessing the courageous contributions of the SCOPE volunteers, Andrew Young, who went on from the Civil Rights Movement to serve as a U.S. Congressman, United Nations Ambassador and Mayor of Atlanta, told a King Holiday audience in Atlanta “The volunteers in SCOPE knew that some of the Freedom Summer workers had been killed the Summer before, but they came anyway.” On another occasion, he told a reunion of civil rights Movement volunteers, including SCOPE veterans “Most of you were taking your lives in your hands by associating with us. It made us truly a national movement, when the students came. Their parents had to learn about the South.”

Books about SCOPE by SCOPE Participants include: ''This Bright Light of Ours: Stories from the Voting Rights Fight'', Maria Gitin, University of Alabama Press Feb 2014. For more information see: www.thisbrightlightofours.com.

Willy Siegel Leventhal offered his collection of SCOPE documents and essays: ''The SCOPE of Freedom'', to enable Gitin to contact some of her co-workers and to conduct some fact checking.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BothSankofa.png|thumb|right|Dual versions of Sankofa. The original is the Sankofa heart. The alternate is the Sankofa bird]] --&gt;

'''Sankofa''' is a word in the [[Twi language]] of [[Ghana]] that translates to "Go back and get it" (''san'' - to return; ''ko'' - to go; ''fa'' - to fetch, to seek and take) and also refers to the [[Asante dialect|Asante]] [[Adinkra symbols|Adinkra]] [[symbol]] represented either with a stylized heart shape or by a bird with its head turned backwards while its feet face forward carrying a precious egg in its mouth. Sankofa is often associated with the proverb, “''Se wo were fi na wosankofa a yenkyi''," which translates as: "It is not wrong to go back for that which you have forgotten."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctl.du.edu/spirituals/Literature/sankofa.cfm |title=African Tradition, Proverbs, and Sankofa |author=The Spirituals Project at the University of Denver |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=19 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420131901/http://ctl.du.edu/spirituals/literature/sankofa.cfm | archivedate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being used on adinkra cloth in Ghana, the Sankofa heart is a common design on gates in the United States, particularly New York City. In Brooklyn, the Sankofa heart is commonly upside down on gates to Brownstone residential buildings.

The sankofa bird appears frequently in traditional [[Akan art]], and has also been adopted as an important symbol in an [[African-American]] and [[African Diaspora]] context to represent the need to reflect on the past to build a successful future. It is one of the most widely dispersed adinkra symbols, appearing in modern jewelry, tattoos, and clothing.

==Akan symbolism==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 45.11.5 Gold Weight in Form of Sankofa Bird.jpg|thumb|Akan Gold Weight Sankofa]]
The [[Akan people]] of Ghana use an Adinkra symbol to represent this same idea and one version of it is similar to the eastern symbol of a heart, and another version is that of a bird with its head turned backwards taking an egg off its back. It symbolizes taking from the past what is good and bringing it into the present in order to make positive progress through the benevolent use of knowledge. Adinkra symbols are used by the [[Akan people]] to express [[proverb]]s and other philosophical ideas.

The sankofa bird also appears on carved wooden Akan stools,&lt;ref&gt;An example is shown at [http://www.conradiator.com/essays/ghanamuseum.html conradiator.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Akan goldweights]], on some ruler's state umbrella or parasol (''ntuatire'') finials and on the staff finials of some court linguists.&lt;ref&gt;An example is shown on the [http://myfundi.co.za/e/Gold_and_proverbs_of_West_Africa myfundi.co.za page on the gold and proverbs of West Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720175728/http://myfundi.co.za/e/Gold_and_proverbs_of_West_Africa |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It functions to foster mutual respect and unity in tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fa.indiana.edu/~conner/akan/symbol.html fa.indiana.edu site on Akan goldweights] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120802030832/http://www.fa.indiana.edu/~conner/akan/symbol.html |date=2012-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a building excavation in [[Lower Manhattan]] in 1991, a cemetery for free and enslaved Africans was discovered.  Over 400 remains were identified, but one coffin in particular stood out. Nailed into its wooden lid were iron tacks, 51 of which formed an enigmatic, heart-shaped design that could be a sankofa symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seeman|first=Erik R.|title=Reassessing the 'Sankofa Symbol' in New York's African Burial Ground,|journal=William and Mary Quarterly|date=January 2010|volume=67|pages=101–22|url=http://www.history.buffalo.edu/documents/SeemanWMQ.pdf|accessdate=17 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611175932/http://www.history.buffalo.edu/documents/SeemanWMQ.pdf|archivedate=11 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Sankofa symbols show themselves all over cities like [[Washington, DC]] and [[New Orleans]], particularly in fence designs.

[[Janet Jackson]] has a sankofa tattoo on her inner right wrist. The symbol is also featured in her 1997 album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', as well as on the supporting tour.

Sankofa is an event used by [[Saint Louis University]] to honor African-American student graduates and students who graduate with degrees in African American studies.

The symbol and name were used in the 1993 film ''[[Sankofa (1993 film)|Sankofa]]'' by [[Haile Gerima]], as well as in the graphic title of the film'' [[500 Years Later]]'' by [[Owen 'Alik Shahadah]].

A UK stage production by Adzido Pan-African Dance Ensemble, scripted by [[Margaret Busby]] and premiered in 1999, was entitled ''Sankofa''.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Brennan, [http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12216869.Rhythms_of_everyday_life/ "Rhythms of everyday life"], ''Herald Scotland'', 10 February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The African-American string band [[Sankofa Strings]], founded in 2005 by Sule Greg C. Wilson, Rhiannon Giddens Laffin, and Dom Flemons, was featured in the 2007 jug band documentary ''Chasin' Gus' Ghost''. The band self-released the CD ''Colored Aristocracy'' in 2006.  A second iteration of the band Sankofa, with Wilson and Flemons, as well as Ndidi Onukwulu and Allison Russell, released the CD ''The Uptown Strut'' in 2012.

[[Cassandra Wilson]] recorded the song "Sankofa", which appeared on her 1993 ''Blue Light 'Til Dawn'' CD.

Sankofa is the name of a Liverpool band formed in 2010. They have released one single "Siren Song" and a four-track EP that includes "Guttermouth" (both available on vinyl and as a download).


A Sankofa bird was carved into the floor of a slave ship by James Keziah Delaney in the second episode of the BBC Television show ''[[Taboo (2017 TV series)|Taboo]]'', and also appears as a tattoo on his upper back.

A '''standing cell''' is  a special cell constructed so as to prevent the prisoner from doing anything but stand.  The ''Stehbunker'' was used in [[Nazi concentration camps]] during the [[Third Reich]], as a punishment.&lt;ref name="LaqueurBaumel2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Walter Laqueur|author2=Judith Tydor Baumel|title=The Holocaust Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPbr0XzlTzcC&amp;pg=PA41|accessdate=30 June 2012|date=29 March 2001|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-08432-0|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Standing cells (called [[Kishka (prison cell)|kishkas]]) were also used during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purges|purges in the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Conquest2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Conquest|title=The Great Terror: A Reassessment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubXQSk2qfXMC&amp;pg=PA278|accessdate=1 July 2012|date=15 November 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-531699-5|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some standing cells were large enough for only one person, others held as many as four people. Punishment in standing cells was ordered for asking for two portions of soup, picking apples, or accidental breakages.&lt;ref name="Yahil1991"/&gt;

==Ottoman Empire==
The [[Armenians|Armenian]] hosiery-manufacturer and musician Samuel Hovannes Zorian was arrested in 1895 by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities for being a political activist. He was beaten and incarcerated in a so-called "police room", measuring barely two feet square in size and with no windows. On the second day, he was dragged out and beaten almost senseless with sticks. Zorian was then sent back to the "police room" where he was confined for a further week and was only sustained on a diet of bread and water, with no medical attention given to him during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EIHG4mld7oMC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=%22merchants+in+exile%22+%22shaken+and+bleeding%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1EpkOH5ykm&amp;sig=uBeP1loE_7Th-gMYcgzZJ9r5Kto&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwib1rySiJzOAhXHBsAKHfqOAn0Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22merchants%20in%20exile%22%20%22shaken%20and%20bleeding%22&amp;f=false |title=Merchants in Exile: The Armenians in Manchester, England, 1835{{ndash}}1935 |page=98 |first=Joan |last=George |publisher=Taderon Press |isbn=978-1903656082 |accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oranienburg ==
[[Sturmabteilung|SA]] camp kommandant [[Werner Schäfer]] had two cells built in the basement of the [[Oranienburg concentration camp]] in 1933. The dimensions of the cell were such that a person could only stand. A prisoner surnamed Neumann was held there for 192 hours and was allegedly driven mad as a result of his confinement. At times, prisoners were held in small coffin-sized closets in which they could only stand.

== Dachau ==
The number of prisoners in [[Dachau concentration camp]] increased dramatically in the last years of the [[Second World War]]. The concentration camp was overcrowded. In late 1944, the camp command erected standing cells. The stone chambers were similar to chimneys and measured 75 x 80 cm (29.5 x 31.5 inches).&lt;ref group=note&gt; The surfaces were measured after camps had been liberated, using foundation ruins.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a small hatch on top for air, and a narrow door with an iron bar bolted to the cell. The intensified punitive measure saved room and reinforced the punitive agony. There were also standing cells at the [[Allach (concentration camp)|Allach subcamp]], where the cells were smaller than at Dachau. Some at other camps were bigger, about 90 x 90 cm (35.5 x 35.5 inches).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/glossary/en/Stehbunker Glossary entry for ''Stehbunker''] Wollheim Memorial, official website. Retrieved June 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the prisoner K. A. Gross and the [[Poland|Polish]] prisoner Max Hoffmann spent days in the standing cell. Hoffmann described it thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was a terrible state, as I thought that it was over for me, everything was so callous and distant for me. I couldn't lie down, couldn't crouch, the best was to stand, stand, six days and six nights long. [...] You touch the walls on both sides with your elbows, your back touches the wall behind you, your knees the wall in front of you. [...] This is no punishment or pre-trial detention, it is [[torture]], straight forward, Middle Ages torture. I had bloodshot eyes, numb from bad air, I was just waiting for the end.&lt;ref&gt; Karel Kasak, ''Cesi v koncentracnim tabore Dachau.'' in ''Almanch Dachau. Kytice udalosti a vzpominek'', Prague, 1946. Cited in Zámečník, ''Das war Dachau'', p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Johannes Neuhäusler]], an inmate in the standing cell received a single piece of bread in three days.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Neuhäusler refers here to two clergymen, Theissig from Aachen, and Johann Lenz.&lt;/ref&gt; On the fourth day, the prisoner was removed from the standing cell, given a normal camp meal ration and allowed to sleep on a wooden cot. On the next day, the three-day confinement in the standing cell began anew.

The [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] did not always adhere to the interruption after the third day. A Czech prisoner, Radovan Drazan, spent eight days without a break in a standing cell.&lt;ref&gt;Zuzana Mosnáková, [http://www.hagalil.com/czech/dachau/dachau-4.htm "Tschechische Häftlinge im Konzentrationslager Dachau"] German Jewish website.

== Auschwitz ==
There were four standing cells at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] in the basement of [[Block 11]], which measured about one yard square, and in which four persons were crammed, able only to stand. There was only a 2" opening for air, so that prisoners wouldn't suffocate.&lt;ref name="Yahil1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leni Yahil|title=The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_aRvKpLUf0C&amp;pg=PA374|accessdate=30 June 2012|date=17 October 1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-504523-9|pages=373–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punishment in these cells was usually imposed for a period of 10 days.&lt;ref name="Yahil1991"/&gt;  Auschwitz survivor Josef Kral testified at the [[Auschwitz Trials]] about the standing cells where he had been held for six weeks with three meals during that time, and about how one prisoner was so hungry, he ate his shoes.&lt;ref name="Wittmann2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rebecca Wittmann|title=Beyond Justice: The Auschwitz Trial|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Q7JRhA9ACUC&amp;pg=PA155|accessdate=30 June 2012|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01694-1|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyvx-Gzb6kM Audio clip of Kral testimony (excerpt) with photos and prisoner drawings] Youtube video.

A '''stem-and-leaf display''' or '''stem-and-leaf plot''' is a device for  presenting [[quantitative data]] in a [[information graphics|graphical]] format, similar to a [[histogram]], to assist in visualizing the [[shape]] of a [[probability distribution|distribution]]. They evolved from [[Arthur Bowley]]'s work in the early 1900s, and are useful tools in [[exploratory data analysis]]. Stemplots became more commonly used in the 1980s after the publication of [[John Tukey]]'s book on ''[[exploratory data analysis]]'' in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity during those years is attributable to their use of [[monospaced]] (typewriter) typestyles that allowed computer technology of the time to easily produce the graphics. Modern computers' superior graphic capabilities have meant these techniques are less often used.

A '''stem-and-leaf display''' is also called a '''stemplot''', but the latter term often refers to another chart type.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/stem.html MATLAB's] and [http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.stem Matplotlib's] stem functions, do ''not'' create a stem-and-leaf display.&lt;/ref&gt;  A simple stem plot may refer to plotting a matrix of ''y'' values onto a common ''x'' axis, and identifying the common'' x'' value with a vertical line, and the individual ''y ''values with symbols on the line.

Unlike histograms, stem-and-leaf displays retain the original data to at least two significant digits, and put the data in order, thereby easing the move to order-based inference and [[non-parametric statistics]].

A basic stem-and-leaf display contains two columns separated by a vertical line. The left column contains the ''stems'' and the right column contains the ''leaves''.

==Constructing a stem-and-leaf display== 
To construct a stem-and-leaf display, the [[observations]] must first be sorted in ascending order: this can be done most easily if working by hand by constructing a draft of the stem-and-leaf display with the leaves unsorted, then sorting the leaves to produce the final stem-and-leaf display. Here is the sorted set of data values that will be used in the following example:

: 44, 46, 47, 49, 63, 64, 66, 68, 68, 72, 72, 75, 76, 81, 84, 88, 106

Next, it must be determined what the stems will represent and what the leaves will represent. Typically, the leaf contains the last digit of the number and the stem contains all of the other digits. In the case of very large numbers, the data values may be rounded to a particular [[place value]] (such as the hundreds place) that will be used for the leaves. The remaining digits to the left of the rounded place value are used as the stem.

In this example, the leaf represents the ones place and the stem will represent the rest of the number (tens place and higher).

The stem-and-leaf display is drawn with two columns separated by a vertical line. The stems are listed to the left of the vertical line. It is important that each stem is listed only once and that no numbers are skipped, even if it means that some stems have no leaves. The leaves are listed in increasing order in a row to the right of each stem.

It is important to note that when there is a repeated number in the data (such as two 72s) then the plot must reflect such (so the plot would look like 7 | 2 2 5 6 7 when it has the numbers 72 72 75 76 77).

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{r|l}
\text{Stem} &amp; \text{Leaf} \\
\hline
 4 &amp; 4~6~7~9 \\
 5 &amp; \\
 6 &amp; 3~4~6~8~8 \\
 7 &amp; 2~2~5~6 \\
 8 &amp; 1~4~8 \\
 9 &amp; \\
10 &amp; 6
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
:Key: &lt;math&gt;6 \mid 3 = 63&lt;/math&gt;
:Leaf unit: 1.0
:Stem unit: 10.0

Rounding may be needed to create a stem-and-leaf display. Based on the following set of data, the stem plot below would be created:

: -23.678758, -12.45, -3.4, 4.43, 5.5, 5.678, 16.87, 24.7, 56.8

For negative numbers, a negative is placed in front of the stem unit, which is still the value X / 10. Non-integers are rounded. This allowed the stem and leaf plot to retain its shape, even for more complicated data sets. As in this example below:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{r|l}
\text{Stem} &amp; \text{Leaf} \\
\hline
-2 &amp; 4 \\
-1 &amp; 2 \\
-0 &amp; 3 \\
 0 &amp; 4~6~6  \\
 1 &amp; 7 \\
 2 &amp; 5 \\
 3 &amp; \\
 4 &amp; \\
 5 &amp; 7
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
:Key: &lt;math&gt;-2 \mid 4 = -24&lt;/math&gt;

==Usage==
Stem-and-leaf displays are useful for displaying the relative density and shape of the data, giving the reader a quick overview of distribution. They retain (most of) the raw numerical data, often with perfect integrity. They are also useful for highlighting [[outlier]]s and finding the [[mode (statistics)|mode]]. However, stem-and-leaf displays are only useful for moderately sized data sets (around 15-150 data points). With very small data sets a stem-and-leaf displays can be of little use, as a reasonable number of data points are required to establish definitive distribution properties. A [[dot plot (statistics)|dot plot]] may be better suited for such data. With very large data sets, a stem-and-leaf display will become very cluttered, since each data point must be represented numerically. A [[box plot]] or [[histogram]] may become more appropriate as the data size increase

[[File:Darcythompson.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|In his 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]'', [[D'Arcy Thompson]] illustrates the [[Transformation (geometry)|geometric transformation]] of [[Argyropelecus|one fish's]] body form into [[Sternoptyx|another]] with a 20° [[shear mapping]]. He does not discuss the [[evolution]]ary causes of such a structural change, and has accordingly been suspected of [[vitalism]].&lt;ref name=Ruse/&gt;]]

'''Biological''' or '''process structuralism''' is a school of biological thought that objects to an exclusively [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] or [[adaptationism|adaptationist]] explanation of [[natural selection]] such as is described in the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|20th century's modern synthesis]]. It proposes instead that [[Alternatives to Darwinism|evolution is guided differently]], basically by more or less physical forces which shape the development of an animal's body, and sometimes implies that these forces supersede selection altogether.

Structuralists have proposed different mechanisms that might have guided the formation of [[body plan]]s. Before Darwin, [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] argued that animals shared  [[homology (biology)|homologous parts]], and that if one was enlarged, the others would be reduced in compensation. After Darwin, [[D'Arcy Thompson]] hinted at [[vitalism]] and offered geometric explanations in his classic 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]''. [[Adolf Seilacher]] suggested mechanical inflation for "pneu" structures in [[Ediacaran biota]] fossils such as ''[[Dickinsonia]]''. [[Günter P. Wagner]] argued for developmental bias, structural constraints on [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]]. [[Stuart Kauffman]] favoured [[self-organisation]], the idea that complex structure emerges [[holism|holistically]] and spontaneously from the dynamic interaction of all parts of an [[organism]]. [[Michael Denton]] argued for laws of form by which [[Universals|Platonic universals]] or "Types" are self-organised. [[Stephen J. Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] proposed [[spandrel (biology)|biological "spandrels"]], features created as a byproduct of the adaptation of nearby structures. [[Gerd B. Müller]] and Stuart A. Newman argued that the appearance in the [[fossil record]] of most of the current [[phylum|phyla]] in the [[Cambrian explosion]] was "pre-Mendelian"{{efn|[[Gregor Mendel]] pioneered the study of [[genetics]].}} evolution caused by physical factors. [[Brian Goodwin]], described by Wagner as part of "a [[pseudoscience|fringe]] movement in evolutionary biology",&lt;ref name=Wagner2014/&gt; denies that biological complexity can be [[reductionism|reduced]] to natural selection, and argues that [[pattern formation]] is driven by [[morphogenetic field]]s.

Darwinian biologists have criticised structuralism, emphasising that there is plentiful evidence both that natural selection is effective and, from [[deep homology]], that [[gene]]s have been involved in shaping organisms throughout [[evolutionary history]]. They accept that some structures such as the [[cell membrane]] self-assemble, but deny the ability of self-organisation to drive large-scale evolution.

==History==
[[File:Alternatives to Darwinism.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Multiple [[alternatives to Darwinism]] have been offered since the 19th century to explain how evolution took place, given that many scientists initially objected to [[natural selection]]. Many of these theories, including structural or developmental constraints, led (solid blue arrows) to some form of directed evolution ([[orthogenesis]]), with or without invoking [[theistic evolution|divine control]] (dotted blue arrows). These theories were largely swept aside by the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of [[genetics]] and natural selection in the early 20th century (dashed orange arrows).]]

===Geoffroy's law of compensation===
{{Main|Cuvier–Geoffroy debate}}

In 1830, [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] argued a structuralist case against the functionalist ([[teleology in biology|teleological]]) position of [[Georges Cuvier]]. Geoffroy believed that [[homology (biology)|homologies]] of structure between animals indicated that they shared an ideal pattern; these did not imply evolution but a unity of plan, a law of nature.{{efn|In this, Geoffroy's homologies were like [[Aristotle's biology|Aristotle's forms]].}} He further believed that if one part was more developed within a structure, the other parts would necessarily be reduced in compensation, as nature always used the same materials: if more of them were used for one feature, less was available for the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Racine, Valerie |title=Essay: The Cuvier-Geoffroy Debate |url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/essay-cuvier-geoffroy-debate |publisher=The Embryo Project Encyclopedia, Arizona State University |date=7 October 2013 |accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===D'Arcy Thompson's morphology===
{{main|On Growth and Form}}

In his "eccentric, beautiful"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leroi, Armand Marie |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]'', [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] revisited the old idea of "[[hylomorphism|universal laws of form]]" to explain the observed forms of living organisms.&lt;ref name=Ruse&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ruse, Michael |editor1-last=Henning |editor1-first=Brian G. |editor2-last=Scarfe |editor2-first=Adam |title=Beyond Mechanism: Putting Life Back Into Biology |date=2013 |publisher=Lexington Books |page=419 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VtosxAtq-EC|chapter=17. From Organicism to Mechanism-and Halfway Back?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The science writer [[Philip Ball]] states that Thompson "presents mathematical principles as a shaping agency that may supersede natural selection, showing how the structures of the living world often echo those in inorganic nature", and notes his "frustration at the '[[Just So Stories|Just So]]' explanations of [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] offered by Darwinians." Instead, Ball writes, Thompson elaborates on how not heredity but physical forces govern biological form.&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ball |first1=Philip |title=In retrospect: On Growth and Form |journal=Nature |date=7 February 2013|volume=494 |issue=7435 |pages=32–33 |doi=10.1038/494032a |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v494/n7435/full/494032a.html|bibcode=2013Natur.494...32B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[philosophy of biology|philosopher of biology]] [[Michael Ruse]] similarly wrote that Thompson "had little time for natural selection", certainly preferring "mechanical explanations" and possibly straying into [[vitalism]].&lt;ref name="Ruse"/&gt;

{{anchor|Pneu structure}}

===Seilacher's pneu structures===
[[File:DickinsoniaCostata.jpg|thumb|''[[Dickinsonia]]'' fossil described as a "pneu" structure with chambers inflated like a quilted [[air mattress]]. In [[Adolf Seilacher]]'s structuralist view, the structure is determined mechanically by the need to distribute the tension across the surface, rather than having been guided by natural selection.]]

Like Thompson, the palaeontologist [[Adolf Seilacher]] emphasised fabricational constraints on form. He interpreted fossils such as ''[[Dickinsonia]]'' in the [[Ediacaran biota]] as "pneu" structures determined by mechanical inflation like a quilted [[air mattress]], rather than having been driven by natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seilacher |first1=Adolf |title=Constructional Morphology and Evolution |editor1-last=Schmidt-Kittler|editor1-first=Norbert |editor2-last=Vogel |editor2-first=Klaus |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-76158-4 |date=1991 |pages=251–271|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-76156-0_17 |chapter=Self-Organizing Mechanisms in Morphogenesis and Evolution }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seilacher |first1=Adolf |authorlink=Adolf Seilacher |title=Vendozoa: Organismic construction in the Proterozoic biosphere |journal=Lethaia |date=July 1989 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=229–239 |doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.1989.tb01332.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wagner's constraints on development===

In his 2014 book ''Homology, Genes, and Evolutionary Innovation'', the evolutionary biologist [[Günter P. Wagner]] argues for "the study of novelty as distinct from adaptation." He defines novelty as occurring when some part of the body develops an individual and quasi-independent existence, in other words as a distinct and recognisable structure, which he implies might occur before natural selection begins to adapt the structure for some function.&lt;ref name=Wagner2014&gt;[[Günter P. Wagner|Wagner, Günter P.]], ''Homology, Genes, and Evolutionary Innovation''.  Princeton University Press. 2014. {{ISBN|978-0691156460}}.

Wagner |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10283.html |publisher=Princeton University Press |accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He forms a structuralist picture of [[evolutionary developmental biology]], using empirical evidence, arguing that [[homology (biology)|homology]] and biological novelty are key aspects requiring explanation, and that developmental bias (i.e. structural constraints on embryonic development) is a key explanation for these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Rachael L. |title=Why development matters |journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy |date=November 2015 |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=889–899 |doi=10.1007/s10539-015-9488-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MullerWagner1991&gt;{{cite journal | last=Muller | first=G.

===Kauffman's self-organisation===
[[File:Fluid Mosaic.svg|thumb|Darwinists and structuralists agree that cell structures like the [[cell membrane]] spontaneously [[self-organization#Biology|self-organize]]. They disagree on how important [[self-organization]] is in other areas of biology.]]

The mathematical biologist [[Stuart Kauffman]] suggested in 1993 that [[self-organization#Biology|self-organization]] may play a role alongside [[natural selection]] in three areas of [[evolutionary biology]], namely [[population dynamics]], [[molecular evolution]], and [[morphogenesis]]. With respect to molecular biology, Kauffman has been criticised for ignoring the role of [[energy]] in driving [[biochemistry|biochemical reactions]] in cells, which can fairly be called self-[[catalysis|catalysing]] but which do not simply self-organise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fox |first1=Ronald F. |title=Review of Stuart Kauffman, The Origins of Order: Self-Organization and Selection in Evolution |journal=Biophys. J. |date=December 1993 |volume=65 |issue=6 |pages=2698–2699 |pmc=1226010 |doi=10.1016/s0006-3495(93)81321-3 |bibcode=1993BpJ....65.2698F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denton's 'T&lt;!--U/C name--&gt;ypes'===
The biochemist [[Michael Denton]]&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Denton|Denton, Michael]]. ''[[Evolution: A Theory in Crisis]]'', Adler &amp; Adler, 1985. ISBN 0-917561-52-X&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; has argued a structuralist case for self-organization. In a 2013 paper, he claimed that "the basic forms of the natural world—the Types—are immanent in nature, and determined by a set of special natural biological laws, the so called 'laws of form'." He asserts that these "recurring patterns and forms" are "genuine [[universals]]".{{efn|Universals are central to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] theory, [[Platonic realism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=plato-metaphysics |title=Plato's Middle Period Metaphysics and Epistemology |last=Silverman |first=Allan}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Form is in this view not shaped by natural selection, but by "self-organizing properties of particular categories of matter" and by "cosmic fine-tuning of the laws of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Denton |first1=Michael J. |title=The Types: A Persistent Structuralist Challenge to Darwinian Pan-Selectionism |journal=BIO-Complexity |date=August 2013 |url=http://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2013.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denton has been criticised by the biochemist Laurence A. Moran as anti-Darwinian and favouring [[creationism]].&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct&gt;{{cite web |last1=Moran |first1=Laurence A. |title=What is "Structuralism"? |url=http://sandwalk.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/what-is-structuralism.html |website=Sandwalk (blog of a recognised expert) |accessdate=9 December 2016|date=2016-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gould and Lewontin's spandrels===
&lt;!--File:San Marco spandrel.jpg|in the [[St Mark's Basilica|Basilica di San Marco]], [[Venice]] --&gt;
[[File:Central Park New York City New York 33.jpg|thumb|An ornamented bridge [[spandrel]]. [[Steven J. Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] argued that the triangular area is a byproduct of the [[adaptation]] of structures around it.]]
{{main|Spandrel (biology)}}

In 1979, influenced by Seilacher among others, the [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Stephen J. Gould]] and the [[population genetics|population geneticist]] [[Richard Lewontin]] wrote what Wagner called "the most influential structuralist manifesto", "The [[spandrel (biology)|Spandrel]]s of San Marco and the [[Panglossian]] Paradigm".&lt;ref name=GouldLewontin1979&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme |journal=Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. B |year=1979 |volume=205 |issue=1161 |pages=581–598 |author1=Stephen Jay Gould |author2=Richard Lewontin |authorlink1=Stephen Jay Gould | authorlink2=Richard Lewontin |ref=Gould1979 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0086|bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..581G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wagner2014/&gt; They pointed out that biological features (like [[spandrel|architectural spandrels]]) did not necessarily have [[adaptation]] as their direct cause. Instead, architects couldn't help creating small triangular areas between [[arch]]es and [[pillar]]s, as arches need (evolve) to be curved, and pillars need to be vertical. The resulting spandrels are [[exaptation]]s, consequences of other evolutionary changes. Evolution, they argued, did not select for a protruding human chin: instead, reducing the length of the tooth row left the jaw protruding.&lt;ref name=Wagner2014/&gt;

===Müller and Newman's pre-Mendelian evolution===

Extreme structuralists like [[Gerd B. Müller]] and Stuart A. Newman, inheriting the viewpoint of D'Arcy Thompson, have proposed that physical laws of structure, not [[genetics]], govern major diversifications such as the [[Cambrian explosion]], followed later by co-opted genetic mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Erwin2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Erwin |first1=Douglas H. |author1link=Douglas Erwin |title=Evolutionary uniformitarianism |journal=Developmental Biology |date=September 2011 |volume=357 |issue=1 |pages=27–34 |doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.01.020 |pmid=21276788 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160611000443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Müller | first1=Gerd B. |author1link=Gerd B.

They note for example that [[deep homology|deep homologies]] between widely separated groups of organisms, such as the [[signalling pathway]]s and [[transcription factor]]s of [[choanoflagellate]]s and [[metazoa]]ns, demonstrate that genes have been involved throughout [[evolutionary history]].&lt;ref name="King2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Nicole |title=The Unicellular Ancestry of Animal Development |journal=Developmental Cell |volume=7 |issue=3 |year=2004 |pages=313–325 |doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2004.08.010|pmid=15363407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response from evolutionary biologists==
[[File:CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified, Animals emphasized.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Laurence Moran notes that structuralism focuses mainly on [[animal]]s, but that animals (emphasized) form only a small portion of the [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]].&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct/&gt;]]

While agreeing that pattern formation mechanisms such as those described by Goodwin exist, the biologists Richard Dawkins, Stephen J. Gould, [[Lynn Margulis]], and [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]] have criticised Goodwin for suggesting that chemical signalling forms an alternative to natural selection.&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct/&gt;

Moran, a "skeptical biochemist", comments that 'structuralism' is a "new buzzword ... guaranteed to impress the creationist crowd because nobody understands what it means but it sounds very 'sciency' and philosophical."&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct/&gt; The philosopher of science [[Paul E. Griffiths]] writes that structuralists "view this structuring of the space of biological possibility as part of the fundamental physical structure of nature. But the phenomena of phylogenetic inertia and developmental constraint do not support this interpretation. These phenomena show that the evolutionary pathways available to an organism are a function of the developmental structure of the organism."&lt;ref name="Griffiths1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Griffiths |first1=Paul E. |authorlink=Paul E. Griffiths |title=Darwinism, Process Structuralism, and Natural Kinds |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=63 |year=1996 |pages=S1–S9 |doi=10.1086/289930 |jstor=188505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moran summarizes: "There's nothing in science that supports the views of the structuralists. We have perfectly good explanations for why bumblebees are different than mushrooms and why all vertebrates have vertebrae and not exoskeletons. There's no evidence to support the idea that if you replay the tape of life it will come out looking anything like what we see today. You can be confident that when you visit another planet you will not find vertebrates."&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''surreal number''' system is a [[total order|totally ordered]] [[proper class]] containing the [[real number]]s as well as [[Infinity|infinite]] and [[infinitesimal|infinitesimal numbers]], respectively larger or smaller in [[absolute value]] than any positive real number.  The surreals share many properties with the reals, including the usual arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division); as such, they form an [[ordered field]].{{efn|In the original formulation using [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], the surreals form a proper class, rather than a set, so the term [[field (mathematics)|field]] is not precisely correct; where this distinction is important, some authors use Field or FIELD to refer to a proper class that has the arithmetic properties of a field.  One can obtain a true field by limiting the construction to a [[Grothendieck universe]], yielding a set with the cardinality of some [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]], or by using a form of set theory in which constructions by [[transfinite recursion]] stop at some countable ordinal such as [[Epsilon numbers (mathematics)|epsilon nought]].}} If formulated in [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], the surreal numbers are a universal ordered field in the sense that all other ordered fields, such as the rationals, the reals, the [[rational function]]s, the [[Levi-Civita field]], the [[superreal number]]s, and the [[hyperreal number]]s, can be realized as subfields of the surreals.&lt;ref name=bajnok&gt;{{cite book|last=Bajnok|first=Béla|title=An Invitation to Abstract Mathematics|year=2013|quote=Theorem 24.29. The surreal number system is the largest ordered field}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surreals also contain all [[transfinite number|transfinite]] [[ordinal number]]s; the arithmetic on them is given by the [[Ordinal arithmetic#Natural operations|natural operations]]. It has also been shown (in Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory) that the maximal class hyperreal field is isomorphic to the maximal class surreal field; in theories without the [[axiom of global choice]], this need not be the case, and in such theories it is not necessarily true that the surreals are a universal ordered field. 

== History of the concept ==
In 1907 [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] introduced [[Hahn series]] as a generalization of [[formal power series]], and [[Felix Hausdorff|Hausdorff]] introduced certain ordered sets called [[η set|η&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;-sets]] for ordinals α and asked if it was possible to find a compatible ordered group or field structure. In 1962 Alling used a modified form of Hahn series to construct such ordered fields associated to certain ordinals α, and taking α to be the class of all ordinals in his construction gives a class that is an ordered field isomorphic to the surreal numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=On the existence of real-closed fields that are  η&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;-sets of power ℵ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;.

Research on the [[go (game)|go]] [[go endgame|endgame]] by [[John Horton Conway]] led to another definition and construction of the surreal numbers.&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Conway.html | title = Conway Biography | last = O'Connor | first = J.J. | last2 = Robertson | first2 = E.F. | accessdate = 2008-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conway's construction was introduced in [[Donald Knuth]]'s 1974 book ''Surreal Numbers: How Two Ex-Students Turned on to Pure Mathematics and Found Total Happiness''. In his book, which takes the form of a dialogue, Knuth coined the term ''surreal numbers'' for what Conway had called simply ''numbers''.  Conway later adopted Knuth's term, and used surreals for analyzing games in his 1976 book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]''.

==Overview==

In the Conway construction,&lt;ref name="Con01"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXiVo8qA5PQC|title=On Numbers and Games|edition=2|last=Conway|first=John H.|date=2000-12-11|orig-year=1976|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781568811277|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the surreal numbers are constructed in stages, along with an ordering ≤ such that for any two surreal numbers ''a'' and ''b'', ''a'' ≤ ''b'' or ''b'' ≤ ''a''.  (Both may hold, in which case ''a'' and ''b'' are equivalent and denote the same number.)  Numbers are formed by pairing subsets of numbers already constructed:  given subsets ''L'' and ''R'' of numbers such that all the members of ''L'' are strictly less than all the members of ''R'', then the pair {{nowrap begin}}{ ''L'' | ''R'' }{{nowrap end}} represents a number intermediate in value between all the members of ''L'' and all the members of ''R''.

Different subsets may end up defining the same number:  {{nowrap begin}}{ ''L'' | ''R'' }{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}{ ''L&amp;prime;'' | ''R&amp;prime;'' }{{nowrap end}} may define the same number even if ''L'' ≠ ''L&amp;prime;'' and ''R'' ≠ ''R&amp;prime;''.  (A similar phenomenon occurs when [[rational numbers]] are defined as quotients of integers:  1/2 and 2/4 are different representations of the same rational number.)  So strictly speaking, the surreal numbers are [[equivalence class]]es of representations of form {{nowrap begin}}{ ''L'' | ''R'' }{{nowrap end}} that designate the same number.

In the first stage of construction, there are no previously existing numbers so the only representation must use the empty set:  {{nowrap begin}}{ | }{{nowrap end}}.  This representation, where ''L'' and ''R'' are both empty, is called 0.  Subsequent stages yield forms like

:{{nowrap begin}}{ 0 | }{{nowrap end}} = 1

:{{nowrap begin}}{ 1 | }{{nowrap end}} = 2

:{{nowrap begin}}{ 2 | }{{nowrap end}} = 3

and

:{{nowrap begin}}{ | 0 }{{nowrap end}} = &amp;minus;1

:{{nowrap begin}}{ | &amp;minus;1 }{{nowrap end}} = &amp;minus;2

:{{nowrap begin}}{ | &amp;minus;2 }{{nowrap end}} = &amp;minus;3

The integers are thus contained within the surreal numbers.  (The above identities are definitions, in the sense that the right-hand side is a name for the left-hand side. That the names are actually appropriate will be evident when the arithmetic operations on surreal numbers are defined, as in the section below). Similarly, representations such as

:{{nowrap begin}}{ 0 | 1 }{{nowrap end}} = 1/2

:{{nowrap begin}}{ 0 | 1/2 }{{nowrap end}} = 1/4

:{{nowrap begin}}{ 1/2 | 1 }{{nowrap end}} = 3/4

arise, so that the [[dyadic rational]]s (rational numbers whose denominators are powers of 2) are contained within the surreal numbers.

After an infinite number of stages, infinite subsets become available, so that any [[real number]] ''a'' can be represented by {{nowrap begin}}{ ''L&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' },{{nowrap end}}
where ''L&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the set of all dyadic rationals less than ''a'' and 
''R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the set of all dyadic rationals greater than ''a'' (reminiscent of a [[Dedekind cut]]).  Thus the real numbers are also embedded within the surreals.

There are also representations like

:{{nowrap begin}}{ 0, 1, 2, 3, &amp;hellip; |  }{{nowrap end}} = &amp;omega;

:{{nowrap begin}}{ 0 | 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, &amp;hellip; }{{nowrap end}} = &amp;epsilon;

where ω is a transfinite number greater than all integers and ε is an infinitesimal greater than 0 but less than any positive real number.  Moreover, the standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) can be extended to these non-real numbers in a manner that turns the collection of surreal numbers into an ordered field, so that one can talk about 2ω or ω &amp;minus; 1 and so forth.

==Construction==

Surreal numbers are [[inductive definition|constructed inductively]] as [[equivalence class]]es of [[ordered pair|pair]]s of sets of surreal numbers, restricted by the condition that each element of the first set is smaller than each element of the second set. The construction consists of three interdependent parts: the construction rule, the comparison rule and the equivalence rule.

===Forms===
A ''form'' is a pair of sets of surreal numbers, called its ''left set'' and its ''right set''. A form with left set ''L'' and right set ''R'' is written {{nowrap begin}}{ ''L'' | ''R'' }{{nowrap end}}.  When ''L'' and ''R'' are given as lists of elements, the braces around them are omitted.

Either or both of the left and right set of a form may be the empty set. The form {{nowrap begin}}{ { } | { } }{{nowrap end}} with both left and right set empty is also written {{nowrap begin}}{ | }{{nowrap end}}.

===Numeric forms===

'''Construction Rule'''
:A form { ''L'' | ''R'' } is ''numeric'' if the intersection of ''L'' and ''R'' is the empty set and each element of ''R'' is greater than every element of ''L'', according to the [[order theory|order relation]] ≤ given by the comparison rule below.

===Equivalence classes of numeric forms===

The numeric forms are placed in equivalence classes; each such equivalence class is a ''surreal number''. The elements of the left and right set of a form are drawn from the universe of the surreal numbers (not of ''forms'', but of their ''equivalence classes'').

'''Equivalence Rule'''
: Two numeric forms ''x'' and ''y'' are forms of the same number (lie in the same equivalence class) if and only if both ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and ''y'' ≤ ''x''.

An [[Order theory|ordering relationship]] must be [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], i.e., it must have the property that ''x'' = ''y'' (i. e., ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and ''y'' ≤ ''x'' are both true) only when ''x'' and ''y'' are the same object.  This is not the case for surreal number ''forms'', but is true by construction for surreal ''numbers'' (equivalence classes).

The equivalence class containing {{nowrap begin}}{ | }{{nowrap end}} is labeled 0; in other words, {{nowrap begin}}{ | }{{nowrap end}} is a form of the surreal number 0.

===Order===

The recursive definition of surreal numbers is completed by defining comparison:

Given numeric forms ''x'' = { ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''X&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' } and ''y'' = { ''Y&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''Y&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' }, ''x'' ≤ ''y'' if and only if:
*there is no ''x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that ''y'' ≤ ''x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' (every element in the left part of ''x'' is smaller than ''y''), and
*there is no ''y&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ ''Y&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that ''y&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ ''x'' (every element in the right part of ''y'' is bigger than ''x'').
A comparison ''y'' ≤ ''c'' between a form ''y'' and a surreal number ''c'' is performed by choosing a form ''z'' from the equivalence class ''c'' and evaluating ''y'' ≤ ''z''; and likewise for ''c'' ≤ ''x'' and for comparison ''b'' ≤ ''c'' between two surreal numbers.

===Induction===

This group of definitions is [[recursion|recursive]], and requires some form of [[mathematical induction]] to define the universe of objects (forms and numbers) that occur in them.  The only surreal numbers reachable via ''finite induction'' are the [[Dyadic rational|dyadic fractions]]; a wider universe is reachable given some form of [[transfinite induction]].

'''Induction Rule'''
* There is a generation ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = { 0 }, in which 0 consists of the single form { | }.
* Given any [[ordinal number]] ''n'', the generation ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of all surreal numbers that are generated by the construction rule from subsets of &lt;math&gt;\cup_{i &lt; n} S_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The base case is actually a special case of the induction rule, with 0 taken as a label for the "least ordinal".  Since there exists no ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' with ''i'' &lt; 0, the expression &lt;math&gt;\cup_{i &lt; 0} S_i&lt;/math&gt; is the empty set; the only subset of the empty set is the empty set, and therefore ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; consists of a single surreal form { | } lying in a single equivalence class 0.

For every finite ordinal number ''n'', ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[well-order]]ed by the ordering induced by the comparison rule on the surreal numbers.

The first iteration of the induction rule produces the three numeric forms { | 0 } &lt; { | } &lt; { 0 | } (the form  { 0 | 0 } is non-numeric because 0≤0).  The equivalence class containing { 0 | } is labeled 1 and the equivalence class containing { | 0 } is labeled −1.  These three labels have a special significance in the axioms that define a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]; they are the additive identity (0), the multiplicative identity (1), and the additive inverse of 1 (−1).  The arithmetic operations defined below are consistent with these labels.

For every ''i'' &lt; ''n'', since every valid form in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is also a valid form in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, all of the numbers in ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' also appear in ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (as supersets of their representation in ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'').  (The set union expression appears in our construction rule, rather than the simpler form ''S&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;'', so that the definition also makes sense when ''n'' is a [[limit ordinal]].)  Numbers in ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' that are a superset of some number in ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are said to have been ''inherited'' from generation ''i''.  The smallest value of α for which a given surreal number appears in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is called its ''birthday''.  For example, the birthday of 0 is 0, and the birthday of −1 is 1.

A second iteration of the construction rule yields the following ordering of equivalence classes:

: { | −1 } = { | −1, 0 } = { | −1, 1 } = { | −1, 0, 1 }
: &lt; { | 0 } = { | 0, 1 }
: &lt; { −1 | 0 } = { −1 | 0, 1 }
: &lt; { | } = { −1 | } = { | 1 } = { −1 | 1 }
: &lt; { 0 | 1 } = { −1, 0 | 1 }
: &lt; { 0 | } = { −1, 0 | }
: &lt; { 1 | } = { 0, 1 | } = { −1, 1 | } = { −1, 0, 1 | }

Comparison of these equivalence classes is consistent, irrespective of the choice of form.  Three observations follow:
# ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contains four new surreal numbers.  Two contain extremal forms: { | −1, 0, 1 } contains all numbers from previous generations in its right set, and { −1, 0, 1 | } contains all numbers from previous generations in its left set.  The others have a form that partitions all numbers from previous generations into two non-empty sets.
# Every surreal number ''x'' that existed in the previous "generation" exists also in this generation, and includes at least one new form: a partition of all numbers ''other than'' ''x'' from previous generations into a left set (all numbers less than ''x'') and a right set (all numbers greater than ''x'').
# The equivalence class of a number depends only on the maximal element of its left set and the minimal element of the right set.

The informal interpretations of { 1 | } and { | −1 } are "the number just after 1" and "the number just before −1" respectively; their equivalence classes are labeled 2 and −2.  The informal interpretations of { 0 | 1 } and { −1 | 0 } are "the number halfway between 0 and 1" and "the number halfway between −1 and 0" respectively; their equivalence classes are labeled &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and −&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  These labels will also be justified by the rules for surreal addition and multiplication below.

The equivalence classes at each stage ''n'' of induction may be characterized by their ''n''-''complete forms'' (each containing as many elements as possible of previous generations in its left and right sets).  Either this complete form contains ''every'' number from previous generations in its left or right set, in which case this is the first generation in which this number occurs; or it contains all numbers from previous generations but one, in which case it is a new form of this one number.  We retain the labels from the previous generation for these "old" numbers, and write the ordering above using the old and new labels:
: −2 &lt; −1 &lt; −&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1 &lt; 2.

The third observation extends to all surreal numbers with finite left and right sets.  (For infinite left or right sets, this is valid in an altered form, since infinite sets might not contain a maximal or minimal element.)  The number { 1, 2 | 5, 8 } is therefore equivalent to { 2 | 5 }; one can establish that these are forms of 3 by using the ''birthday property'', which is a consequence of the rules above.

'''Birthday property'''
: A form ''x'' = { ''L'' | ''R'' } occurring in generation ''n'' represents a number inherited from an earlier generation ''i'' &lt; ''n'' if and only if there is some number in ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' that is greater than all elements of ''L'' and less than all elements of the ''R''.  (In other words, if ''L'' and ''R'' are already separated by a number created at an earlier stage, then ''x'' does not represent a new number but one already constructed.)  If ''x'' represents a number from any generation earlier than ''n'', there is a least such generation ''i'', and exactly one number ''c'' with this least ''i'' as its birthday lies between ''L'' and ''R''.  ''x'' is a form of this ''c'', i. e., it lies in the equivalence class in ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' that is a superset of the representation of ''c'' in generation ''i''.

==Arithmetic==

The addition, negation (additive inverse), and multiplication of surreal number ''forms'' ''x'' = { ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''X&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' } and ''y'' = { ''Y&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''Y&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' } are defined by three recursive formulas.

===Negation===

Negation of a given number {{nowrap begin}}''x'' = { ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''X&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' }{{nowrap end}} is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;-x = - \{ X_L | X_R \} = \{ -X_R | -X_L \}&lt;/math&gt;,
where the negation of a set ''S'' of numbers is given by the set of the negated elements of ''S'':
:&lt;math&gt;-S = \{ -s: s \in S \}&lt;/math&gt;.

This formula involves the negation of the surreal ''numbers'' appearing in the left and right sets of ''x'', which is to be understood as the result of choosing a form of the number, evaluating the negation of this form, and taking the equivalence class of the resulting form.  This only makes sense if the result is the same, irrespective of the choice of form of the operand.  This can be proven inductively using the fact that the numbers occurring in ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''X&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' are drawn from generations earlier than that in which the form ''x'' first occurs, and observing the special case:
: -0 = - { | } = { | } = 0.

===Addition===
The definition of addition is also a recursive formula:
: &lt;math&gt;x + y = \{ X_L | X_R \} + \{ Y_L | Y_R \} = \{ X_L + y, x + Y_L | X_R + y, x + Y_R \}&lt;/math&gt;,
where

:&lt;math&gt;X + y = \{ x + y: x \in X \} , x + Y = \{ x + y: y \in Y \}&lt;/math&gt;.

This formula involves sums of one of the original operands and a surreal ''number'' drawn from the left or right set of the other.  These are to be understood as the result of choosing a form of the numeric operand, performing the sum of the two forms, and taking the equivalence class of the resulting form.  This only makes sense if the result is the same, irrespective of the choice of form of the numeric operand.  This can also be proven inductively with the special cases:
: 0 + 0 = { | } + { | } = { | } = 0
: ''x'' + 0 = x + { | } = { ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 0 | ''X&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 0 } = { ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''X&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' } = ''x''
: 0 + ''y'' = { | } + ''y'' = { 0 + ''Y&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' | 0 + ''Y&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' } = { ''Y&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''Y&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' } = ''y''
(The latter two cases are themselves proven inductively.)

===Multiplication===

The recursive formula for multiplication contains arithmetic expressions involving the operands and their left and right sets, such as the expression &lt;math&gt;X_R y + x Y_R - X_R Y_R&lt;/math&gt; that appears in the left set of the product of ''x'' and ''y''.  This is to be understood as the set of surreal numbers resulting from choosing one number from each set that appears in the expression and evaluating the expression on these numbers.  (In each individual evaluation of the expression, only one number is chosen from each set, and is substituted in each place where that set appears in the expression.)

This depends, in turn, on the ability to (a) multiply pairs of surreal ''numbers'' drawn from the left and right sets of ''x'' and ''y'' to get a surreal number, and negate the result; (b) multiply the surreal number ''form'' ''x'' or ''y'' and a surreal ''number'' drawn from the left or right set of the other operand to get a surreal number; and (c) add the resulting surreal numbers.  This again involves special cases, this time containing 0 = { | }, the multiplicative identity 1 = { 0 | }, and its additive inverse -1 = { | 0 }.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
xy &amp; = \{ X_L | X_R \} \{ Y_L | Y_R \} \\
   &amp; = \left\{ X_L y + x Y_L - X_L Y_L, X_R y + x Y_R - X_R Y_R | X_L y + x Y_R - X_L Y_R, x Y_L + X_R y - X_R Y_L \right\} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Division ===
The definition of division is done in terms of the reciprocal and multiplication:

&lt;math&gt;\frac xy = x \left( \frac 1y \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;\frac 1y = \Bigg \{0, \frac{1+(y^R-y)(\frac1y)^L}{y^R}, \frac{1+(y^L-y)(\frac1y)^R}{y^L} \Bigg | \frac{1+(y^L-y)(\frac1y)^L}{y^L}, \frac{1+(y^R-y)(\frac1y)^R}{y^R} \Bigg \}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Con01" /&gt;{{rp|21}}

for positive &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Only positive &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y^L&lt;/math&gt; are permitted in the formula, with any nonpositive terms being ignored (and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y^R&lt;/math&gt; are always positive). This formula involves not only recursion in terms of being able to divide by numbers from the left and right sets of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, but also recursion in that the members of the left and right sets of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac 1y&lt;/math&gt; itself. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is always a member of the left set of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac 1y&lt;/math&gt;, and that can be used to find more terms in a recursive fashion. For example, if &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y = 3 = \{2|\}&lt;/math&gt;, then we know a left term of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac 13&lt;/math&gt; will be &lt;math display="inline"&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. This in turn means &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{1+(2-3)0}2=1/2&lt;/math&gt; is a right term. This means &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{1+(2-3)\left(\frac12\right)}2=\frac14&lt;/math&gt; is a left term. This means &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{1+(2-3)\left(\frac14\right)}2 = \frac 38&lt;/math&gt; will be a right term. Continuing, this gives &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac13 = \{0, \frac14, \frac5{16}, \ldots | \frac12, \frac38, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;.

For negative &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac 1y&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac1y=-\left(\frac1{-y}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\frac 1y&lt;/math&gt; is undefined.

===Consistency===

It can be shown that the definitions of negation, addition and multiplication are consistent, in the sense that:
* addition and negation are defined recursively in terms of "simpler" addition and negation steps, so that operations on numbers with birthday ''n'' will eventually be expressed entirely in terms of operations on numbers with birthdays less than ''n'';
* multiplication is defined recursively in terms of additions, negations, and "simpler" multiplication steps, so that the product of numbers with birthday ''n'' will eventually be expressed entirely in terms of sums and differences of products of numbers with birthdays less than ''n'';
* as long as the operands are well-defined surreal number forms (each element of the left set is less than each element of the right set), the results are again well-defined surreal number forms;
* the operations can be extended to ''numbers'' (equivalence classes of forms): the result of negating ''x'' or adding or multiplying ''x'' and ''y'' will represent the same number regardless of the choice of form of ''x'' and ''y''; and
* these operations obey the associativity, commutativity, additive inverse, and distributivity axioms in the definition of a [[field (mathematics)|field]], with additive identity 0 = { | } and multiplicative identity 1 = { 0 | }.

With these rules one can now verify that the numbers found in the first few generations were properly labeled.  The construction rule is repeated to obtain more generations of surreals:

: ''S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = { 0 }
: ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = { −1 &lt; 0 &lt; 1 }
: ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = { −2 &lt; −1 &lt; −&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1 &lt; 2}
: ''S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' = { −3 &lt; −2 &lt; −&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; −1 &lt; −&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; −&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; −&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1 &lt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 2 &lt; 3 }
: ''S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' = { −4 &lt; −3 &lt; ... &lt; −&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1 &lt; &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 2 &lt; &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 3 &lt; 4 }

===Arithmetic closure===

For each [[natural number]] (finite ordinal) ''n'', all numbers generated in ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are [[dyadic fraction]]s, i.e., can be written as an [[irreducible fraction]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{2^b}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'' and ''b'' are [[integer]]s and 0 ≤ ''b'' &lt; ''n''.

The set of all surreal numbers that are generated in some ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' for finite ''n'' may be denoted as ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\cup_{n \in N}  S_n&lt;/math&gt;.  One may form the three classes ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = { 0 }, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt; { x \in S_*: x &gt; 0 }&lt;/math&gt;, and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt; { x \in S_*: x &lt; 0 }&lt;/math&gt;, of which ''S&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the union.  No individual ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is closed under addition and multiplication (except ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), but ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; is; it is the subring of the rationals consisting of all dyadic fractions.

There are infinite ordinal numbers β for which the set of surreal numbers with birthday less than β is closed under the different arithmetic operations.&lt;ref name=vdDE2001&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van den Dries | first1 = Lou | last2 = Ehrlich | first2 = Philip | author2-link = Philip Ehrlich | title = Fields of surreal numbers and exponentiation | journal =  Fundamenta Mathematicae | volume = 167 | issue = 2 | pages = 173–188 | publisher = Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences | location = Warszawa | date = January 2001 | url = http://www.ohio.edu/people/ehrlich/EhrlichvandenDries.pdf | issn = 0016-2736 | doi = 10.4064/fm167-2-3 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161021010354/http://www.ohio.edu/people/ehrlich/EhrlichvandenDries.pdf | archivedate = 2016-10-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For any ordinal α, the set of surreal numbers with birthday less than β = ω&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; (using [[#Powers of ω|powers of ω]]) is closed under addition and forms a group; for birthday less than ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it is closed under multiplication and forms a ring;{{efn|1=The set of dyadic fractions constitutes the simplest non-trivial group and ring of this kind; it consists of the surreal numbers with birthday less than ω = ω&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.}} and for birthday less than an (ordinal) [[Epsilon number (mathematics)|epsilon number]] ε&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; it is closed under multiplicative inverse and forms a field.

However, it is always possible to construct a surreal number that is greater than any member of a set (by including the set on the left side of the constructor) and thus the collection of surreal numbers is a proper [[mathematical class|class]]. With their ordering and algebraic operations they constitute an [[ordered field]], with the caveat that they do not form a [[Set (mathematics)|set]].  In fact, it is a very special ordered field: the biggest one.  Every other ordered field can be embedded in the surreals. The class of all surreal numbers is denoted by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{No}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Infinity ==

Define ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; as the set of all surreal numbers generated by the construction rule from subsets of ''S&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;''.  (This is the same inductive step as before, since the ordinal number ω is the smallest ordinal that is larger than all natural numbers; however, the set union appearing in the inductive step is now an infinite union of finite sets, and so this step can only be performed in a set theory that allows such a union.)  A unique infinitely large positive number occurs in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;  \omega = \{ S_* | \} = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, ... | \}. &lt;/math&gt;
''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; also contains objects that can be identified as the [[rational number]]s.  For example, the ω-complete form of the fraction &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is given by:
: &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1} {3} = \{ y \in S_*: 3 y &lt; 1 | y \in S_*: 3 y &gt; 1 \}&lt;/math&gt;.
The product of this form of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with any form of 3 is a form whose left set contains only numbers less than 1 and whose right set contains only numbers greater than 1; the birthday property implies that this product is a form of 1.

Not only do all the rest of the [[rational number]]s appear in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;; the remaining finite [[real number]]s do too.  For example,
: &lt;math&gt; \pi = \{ 3, \frac{25}{8},\frac{201}{64}, ... | 4, \frac{7}{2}, \frac{13}{4}, \frac{51}{16},... \}&lt;/math&gt;.

The only infinities in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; are ω and −ω; but there are other non-real numbers in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; among the reals.  Consider the smallest positive number in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon = \{ S_- \cup S_0 | S_+ \} = \{ 0 | 1, \tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{4}, \tfrac{1}{8}, ... \} = \{ 0 | y \in S_* : y &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;.
This number is larger than zero but less than all positive dyadic fractions. It is therefore an [[infinitesimal]] number, often labeled ε.  The ω-complete form of ε (resp. -ε) is the same as the ω-complete form of 0, except that 0 is included in the left (resp. right) set.  The only "pure" infinitesimals in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; are ε and its additive inverse -ε; adding them to any dyadic fraction ''y'' produces the numbers ''y''±ε, which also lie in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;.

One can determine the relationship between ω and ε by multiplying particular forms of them to obtain:
: ω · ε = { ε · ''S''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; | ω · ''S''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; + ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; + ε · ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; }.
This expression is only well-defined in a set theory which permits transfinite induction up to &lt;math&gt;S_{\omega^2}&lt;/math&gt;.  In such a system, one can demonstrate that all the elements of the left set of ω · ε are positive infinitesimals and all the elements of the right set are positive infinities, and therefore ω · ε is the oldest positive finite number, i. e., 1.  Consequently,
: &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; = ω.
Some authors systematically use ω&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in place of the symbol ε.

===Contents of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;===

Given any ''x'' = { ''L'' | ''R'' } in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;, exactly one of the following is true:
* ''L'' and ''R'' are both empty, in which case ''x'' = 0;
* ''R'' is empty and some integer ''n''≥0 is greater than every element of ''L'', in which case ''x'' equals the smallest such integer ''n'';
* ''R'' is empty and no integer ''n'' is greater than every element of ''L'', in which case ''x'' equals +ω;
* ''L'' is empty and some integer ''n''≤0 is less than every element of ''R'', in which case ''x'' equals the largest such integer ''n'';
* ''L'' is empty and no integer ''n'' is less than every element of ''R'', in which case ''x'' equals -ω;
* ''L'' and ''R'' are both non-empty, and:
** some dyadic fraction ''y'' is "strictly between" ''L'' and ''R'' (greater than all elements of ''L'' and less than all elements of ''R''), in which case ''x'' equals the oldest such dyadic fraction ''y'';
** no dyadic fraction ''y'' lies strictly between ''L'' and ''R'', but some dyadic fraction &lt;math&gt; y \in L&lt;/math&gt; is greater than or equal to all elements of ''L'' and less than all elements of ''R'', in which case ''x'' equals ''y''+ε;
** no dyadic fraction ''y'' lies strictly between ''L'' and ''R'', but some dyadic fraction &lt;math&gt; y \in R&lt;/math&gt; is greater than all elements of ''L'' and less than or equal to all elements of ''R'', in which case ''x'' equals ''y''-ε;
** every dyadic fraction is either greater than some element of ''R'' or less than some element of ''L'', in which case ''x'' is some real number that has no representation as a dyadic fraction.

''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; is not an algebraic field, because it is not closed under arithmetic operations; consider ω+1, whose form &lt;math&gt; \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, ... | \} + \{ 0 | \} = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., \omega | \}&lt;/math&gt; does not lie in any number in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;.  The maximal subset of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; that is closed under (finite series of) arithmetic operations is the field of real numbers, obtained by leaving out the infinities ±ω, the infinitesimals ±ε, and the infinitesimal neighbors ''y''±ε of each nonzero dyadic fraction ''y''.

This construction of the real numbers differs from the [[Dedekind cut]]s of [[standard analysis]] in that it starts from dyadic fractions rather than general rationals and naturally identifies each dyadic fraction in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; with its forms in previous generations.  (The ω-complete forms of real elements of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; are in one-to-one correspondence with the reals obtained by Dedekind cuts, under the proviso that Dedekind reals corresponding to rational numbers are represented by the form in which the cut point is omitted from both left and right sets.)  The rationals are not an identifiable stage in the surreal construction; they are merely the subset ''Q'' of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; containing all elements ''x'' such that ''x'' ''b'' = ''a'' for some ''a'' and some nonzero ''b'', both drawn from ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;.  By demonstrating that ''Q'' is closed under individual repetitions of the surreal arithmetic operations, one can show that it is a field; and by showing that every element of ''Q'' is reachable from ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; by a finite series (no longer than two, actually) of arithmetic operations ''including multiplicative inversion'', one can show that ''Q'' is strictly smaller than the subset of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; identified with the reals.

The set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; has the same [[cardinality]] as the real numbers ''R''.  This can be demonstrated by exhibiting surjective mappings from ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; to the closed unit interval ''I'' of ''R'' and vice versa.  Mapping ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''I'' is routine; map numbers less than or equal to ε (including -ω) to 0, numbers greater than or equal to 1-ε (including ω) to 1, and numbers between ε and 1-ε to their equivalent in ''I'' (mapping the infinitesimal neighbors ''y''±ε of each dyadic fraction ''y'', along with ''y'' itself, to ''y'').  To map ''I'' onto ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;, map the (open) central third (1/3, 2/3) of ''I'' onto { | } = 0; the central third (7/9, 8/9) of the upper third to { 0 | } = 1; and so forth.  This maps a nonempty open interval of ''I'' onto each element of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;, monotonically.  The residue of ''I'' consists of the [[Cantor set]] ''2''&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;, each point of which is uniquely identified by a partition of the central-third intervals into left and right sets, corresponding precisely to a form { ''L'' | ''R'' } in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;.  This places the Cantor set in one-to-one correspondence with the set of surreal numbers with birthday ω.

== Transfinite induction ==

Continuing to perform transfinite induction beyond ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; produces more ordinal numbers α, each represented as the largest surreal number having birthday α.  (This is essentially a definition of the ordinal numbers resulting from transfinite induction.)  The first such ordinal is ω+1 = { ω | }.  There is another positive infinite number in generation ω+1:
: ω−1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, ... | ω }.
It is important to observe that the surreal number ω−1 is not an ordinal; the ordinal ω is not the successor of any ordinal.  This is a surreal number with birthday ω+1, which is labeled ω−1 on the basis that it coincides with the sum of ω = { 1, 2, 3, 4, ... | } and −1 = { | 0 }.  Similarly, there are two new infinitesimal numbers in generation ω+1:
: 2ε = ε + ε = { ε | 1+ε, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+ε, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;+ε, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;+ε, ... } and
: ε/2 = ε · &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = { 0 | ε }.

At a later stage of transfinite induction, there is a number larger than ω+''k'' for all natural numbers ''k'':
: 2ω = ω + ω = { ω+1, ω+2, ω+3, ω+4, ... | }
This number may be labeled ω + ω both because its birthday is ω + ω (the first ordinal number not reachable from ω by the successor operation) and because it coincides with the surreal sum of ω and ω; it may also be labeled 2ω because it coincides with the product of ω = { 1, 2, 3, 4, ... | } and 2 = { 1 | }.  It is the second limit ordinal; reaching it from ω via the construction step requires a transfinite induction on &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{k &lt; \omega} S_{\omega + k}&lt;/math&gt;.  This involves an infinite union of infinite sets, which is a "stronger" set theoretic operation than the previous transfinite induction required.

Note that the ''conventional'' addition and multiplication of ordinals does not always coincide with these operations on their surreal representations.  The sum of ordinals 1 + ω equals ω, but the surreal sum is commutative and produces 1 + ω = ω + 1 &gt; ω.  The addition and multiplication of the surreal numbers associated with ordinals coincides with the [[ordinal arithmetic#Natural operations|natural sum and natural product]] of ordinals.

Just as 2ω is bigger than ω + ''n'' for any natural number ''n'', there is a surreal number ω/2 that is infinite but smaller than ω − ''n'' for any natural number ''n''.  That is, ω/2 is defined by
: ω/2 = { ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; | ω − ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; }
where on the right hand side the notation ''x'' − ''Y'' is used to mean { ''x'' − ''y'' : ''y'' in ''Y'' }.  It can be identified as the product of ω and the form { 0 | 1 } of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The birthday of &lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the limit ordinal ω2.

== Powers of ω ==

To classify the "orders" of infinite and infinitesimal surreal numbers, also known as [[archimedean property|archimedean]] classes, Conway associated to each surreal number ''x'' the surreal number
* ω&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; = { 0, ''r'' ω&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; | ''s'' ω&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; },
where ''r'' and ''s'' range over the positive real numbers.  If ''x'' &lt; ''y'' then ω&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt; is "infinitely greater" than ω&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, in that it is greater than ''r'' ω&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; for all real numbers ''r''.  Powers of ω also satisfy the conditions
* ω&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; ω&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt; = ω&lt;sup&gt;''x+y''&lt;/sup&gt;,
* ω&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1/ω&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;,
so they behave the way one would expect powers to behave.

Each power of ω also has the redeeming feature of being the ''simplest'' surreal number in its archimedean class; conversely, every archimedean class within the surreal numbers contains a unique simplest member.  Thus, for every positive surreal number ''x'' there will always exist some positive real number ''r'' and some surreal number ''y'' so that ''x'' − ''r'' ω&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt; is "infinitely smaller" than ''x''.  The exponent ''y'' is the "base ω logarithm" of ''x'', defined on the positive surreals; it can be demonstrated that log&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; maps the positive surreals onto the surreals and that log&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;(''xy'') = log&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') + log&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'').

This gets extended by transfinite induction so that every surreal number ''x'' has a "normal form" analogous to the [[Ordinal arithmetic#Cantor normal form|Cantor normal form]] for ordinal numbers.  Every surreal number may be uniquely written as
* ''x'' = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ω&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ω&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; + …,
where every ''r''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is a nonzero real number and the ''y''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;s form a strictly decreasing sequence of surreal numbers.  This "sum", however, may have infinitely many terms, and in general has the length of an arbitrary ordinal number. (Zero corresponds of course to the case of an empty sequence, and is the only surreal number with no leading exponent.)

Looked at in this manner, the surreal numbers resemble a [[Formal power series|power series field]], except that the decreasing sequences of exponents must be bounded in length by an ordinal and are not allowed to be as long as the class of ordinals. This is the basis for the formulation of the surreal numbers as a [[#Hahn series|Hahn series]].

==Gaps and continuity==

In contrast to the real numbers, a (proper) subset of the surreal numbers does not have a least upper (or lower) bound unless it has a maximal (minimal) element. Conway defines&lt;ref name=Con01/&gt; a gap as {''L'' | ''R''}, ''L'' &lt; ''R'', ''L'' ∪ ''R'' = 𝐍𝐨; this is not a number because at least one of the sides is a proper class. Though similar, gaps are not quite the same as [[Dedekind cut|Dedekind sections]]{{efn|The definition of a gap omits the conditions of a Dedekind cut that ''L'' and ''R'' be non-empty and that ''L'' not have a largest element, and also the identification of a cut with the smallest element in ''R'' if one exists.}}, but we can still talk about a completion 𝐍𝐨&lt;sup&gt;𝕯&lt;/sup&gt; of the surreal numbers with the natural ordering which is a (proper class-sized) [[linear continuum]].&lt;ref name=RSS15&gt;{{cite arXiv|first1=Simon|last1=Rubinstein-Salzedo|first2=Ashvin|last2=Swaminathan|arxiv=1307.7392v3|class=math.CA|date=2015-05-19|title=Analysis on Surreal Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance there is no least positive infinite surreal, but the gap ∞ = {''x'': ∃ ''n'' ∈ ℕ: ''x'' &lt; ''n'' | ''x'': ∀ ''n'' ∈ ℕ: ''x'' &gt; ''n''} is greater than all real numbers and less than all positive infinite surreals, and is thus the least upper bound of the reals in 𝐍𝐨&lt;sup&gt;𝕯&lt;/sup&gt;. Similarly the gap 𝐎𝐧 = { 𝐍𝐨 | } is larger than all surreal numbers. (𝐎𝐧 is also the name of the class of ordinal numbers, and since 𝐎𝐧 is [[Cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] in 𝐍𝐨 and thus 𝐎𝐧 = { 𝐎𝐧 | } as well, this extends the equivalence of an ordinal α with the set of ordinals smaller than α).

With a bit of set-theoretic care&lt;ref name=RSS15/&gt;{{efn|Importantly there is no claim that the collection of Cauchy sequences constitutes a class in NBG set theory.}} 𝐍𝐨 can be equipped with a topology where the open sets are unions of open intervals (indexed by proper sets) and continuous functions can be defined. An equivalent of Cauchy sequences can be defined as well although they have to be indexed by the class of ordinals; these will always converge, but the limit may be either a number or a gap that can be expressed as ∑&lt;sub&gt;α∈𝐍𝐨&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with
''a''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; decreasing and having no lower bound in 𝐍𝐨. (All such gaps can be understood as Cauchy sequences themselves but there are other types of gap that are not limits, such as ∞ and 𝐎𝐧).

==Exponential function==
Based on unpublished work by [[Martin David Kruskal|Kruskal]], a construction (by transfinite induction) that extends the real [[exponential function]] exp(''x'') (with base ''e'') to the surreals was carried through by Gonshor.&lt;ref name=G1986 /&gt;{{rp|at=ch. 10}}

===Other exponentials===
The [[#Powers of ω|powers of ω]] function is also an exponential function, but does not have the properties desired for an extension of the function on the reals. It will, however, be needed in the development of the base-''e'' exponential, and it is this function that is meant whenever the notation ω&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; is used in the following.

When ''y'' is a dyadic fraction, the [[power function]] {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ No}}, {{nowrap|''x'' ↦ ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt;}} may be composed from multiplication, multiplicative inverse and square root, all of which can be defined inductively. Its values are completely determined by the basic relation {{nowrap|1=''x&lt;sup&gt;y+z&lt;/sup&gt; = x&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;·x&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;/sup&gt;'',}} and where defined it necessarily agrees with any other [[exponentiation]] that can exist.

===Basic induction===
The induction steps for the surreal exponential are based on the series expansion for the real exponential, {{nowrap|1=exp ''x'' = ∑&lt;sub&gt;''n''≥0&lt;/sub&gt; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/n!,}} more specifically those partial sums that can be shown by basic algebra to be positive but less than all later ones. For ''x'' positive these are denoted [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and include all partial sums; for ''x'' negative but finite, [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the odd steps in the series starting from the first one with a positive real part (which always exists). For ''x'' negative infinite the odd-numbered partial sums are strictly decreasing and the [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; notation denotes the empty set, but it turns out that the corresponding elements are not needed in the induction.

The relations that hold for real
{{nowrap|1=''x'' &lt; ''y''}}
are then
{{nowrap|1=exp ''x'' · [''y–x'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; exp ''y''}}
and
{{nowrap|1=exp ''y'' · [''x–y'']&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; exp ''x'',}}
and this can be extended to the surreals with the definition 
{{nowrap|1=exp ''z'' = { 0,
exp ''z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' · [''z–z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; , exp ''z&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' · [''z–z&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'']&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; {{pipe}}
exp ''z&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' / [''z&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;–z'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; , exp ''z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' / [''z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;–z'']&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; }.}} This is well-defined for all surreal arguments (the value exists and does not depend on the choice of ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;).
===Results===
Using this definition, the following holds:{{efn|Even the most trivial-looking of these equalities may involve transfinite induction and constitute a  separate theorem.}}
* exp is a strictly increasing positive function, {{nowrap|1=''x'' &lt; ''y'' ⇒ 0 &lt; exp ''x'' &lt; exp ''y''}}
* exp satisfies {{nowrap|1=exp(''x''+''y'') = exp ''x'' · exp ''y''}}
* exp is a surjection (onto '''No'''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;) and has a well-defined inverse, {{nowrap|1=log = exp&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;}}
* exp coincides with the usual exponential function on the reals (and thus {{nowrap|1=exp 0 = 1, exp 1 = ''e''}})
* For ''x'' infinitesimal, the value of the formal power series {{nowrap|1=∑&lt;sub&gt;''n''≥0&lt;/sub&gt; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/''n''!}} is well defined and coincides with the inductive definition
** When ''x'' is given in Conway normal form, the set of exponents in the result is well-ordered and the coefficients are finite sums, directly giving the normal form of the result (which has a leading 1)
** Similarly, for ''x'' infinitesimally close to 1, log ''x'' is given by power series expansion of {{nowrap|''x''–1}}
* For positive infinite ''x'', exp ''x'' is infinite as well
** If ''x'' has the form ω&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; (α &gt; 0), exp ''x'' has the form ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; where β is a strictly increasing function of α. In fact there is an inductively defined bijection {{nowrap|1=''g'': '''No'''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; → '''No''': α ↦ β}} whose inverse can also be defined inductively
** If ''x'' is "pure infinite" with normal form {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ∑&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;β&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}} where all {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0}}, then {{nowrap|1=exp ''x'' = ω&lt;sup&gt;∑&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;β&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;''g''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}}
** Similarly, for {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ω&lt;sup&gt;∑&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;β&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the inverse is given by {{nowrap|1=log ''x'' = ∑&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;β&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;''g&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;(b''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;}}
* Any surreal number can be written as the sum of a pure infinite, a real and an infinitesimal part, and the exponential is the product of the partial results given above
** The normal form can be written out by multiplying the infinite part (a single power of ω) and the real exponential into the power series resulting from the infinitesimal
** Conversely, dividing out the leading term of the normal form will bring any surreal number into the form {{nowrap|1=(ω&lt;sup&gt;∑&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;δ&lt;/sub&gt;''t''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)·''r''·(1 + ∑&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;β&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, for {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0}}, where each factor has a form for which a way of calculating the logarithm has been given above; the sum is then the general logarithm
*** While there is no general inductive definition of log (unlike for exp), the partial results are given in terms of such definitions. In this way, the logarithm can be calculated explicitly, without reference to the fact that it's the inverse of the exponential.
* The exponential function is much greater than any finite power
** For any positive infinite ''x'' and any finite ''n'', exp(''x'')/''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is infinite
** For any integer ''n'' and surreal ''x'' &amp;gt; ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, exp(''x'') &amp;gt; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. This stronger constraint is one of the Ressayre axioms for the real [[exponential field]]&lt;ref name=vdDE2001 /&gt;
* exp satisfies all the Ressayre axioms for the real exponential field&lt;ref name=vdDE2001 /&gt;
** The surreals with exponential is an [[elementary extension]] of the real exponential field
** For ε&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; an ordinal epsilon number, the set of surreal numbers with birthday less than ε&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; constitute a field that is closed under exponentials, and is likewise an elementary extension of the real exponential field

===Examples===
The surreal exponential is essentially given by its behaviour on positive powers of ω, i.e., the function ''g(a)'', combined with well-known behaviour on finite numbers. Only examples of the former will be given. In addition, {{nowrap|1=''g(a)'' = ''a''}} holds for a large part of its range, for instance for any finite number with positive real part and any infinite number that is less than some iterated power of ω ({{nowrap|ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;·&lt;sup&gt;·&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}} for some number of levels).
* exp ω = ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;
* exp ω&lt;sup&gt;1/ω&lt;/sup&gt; = ω and log ω = ω&lt;sup&gt;1/ω&lt;/sup&gt;
* exp (ω · log ω) = exp (ω · ω&lt;sup&gt;1/ω&lt;/sup&gt;) = ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;(1 + 1/ω)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
** This shows that the "power of ω" function is not compatible with exp, since compatibility would demand a value of ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; here
* exp ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + 1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
* log ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; =  ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; / ω

===Exponentiation===
A general exponentiation can be defined as {{nowrap|1=''x&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;'' = exp(''y'' · log ''x'')}}, giving an interpretation to expressions like {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; = exp(ω · log 2) = ω&lt;sup&gt;log 2 · ω&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Again it is essential to distinguish this definition from the "powers of ω" function, especially if ω may occur as the base.

== Surcomplex numbers ==

A '''surcomplex number''' is a number of the form {{math|''a+bi''}}, where ''a'' and ''b'' are surreal numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jamespropp.org/surreal/text.ps.gz Surreal vectors and the game of Cutblock], James Propp, August 22, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alling"&gt;{{cite book | last = Alling | first = Norman L. | title = Foundations of Analysis over Surreal Number Fields | publisher = North-Holland | series = Mathematics Studies 141 | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-444-70226-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The surcomplex numbers form an [[algebraically closed]] [[field (mathematics)|field]] (except for being a proper class), [[isomorphic (mathematics)|isomorphic]] to the [[algebraic closure]] of the field generated by extending the [[rational numbers]] by a [[proper class]] of [[algebraically independent]] [[transcendental (mathematics)|transcendental]] elements.  Up to field [[isomorphism]], this fact characterizes the field of surcomplex numbers within any fixed set theory.&lt;ref name=Con01/&gt;{{rp|Th.27}}

==Games==
{{main article|combinatorial game theory}}

The definition of surreal numbers contained one restriction: each element of L must be strictly less than each element of R.  If this restriction is dropped we can generate a more general class known as ''games''.  All games are constructed according to this rule:

:'''Construction Rule'''&lt;br/&gt; If ''L'' and ''R'' are two sets of games then { ''L'' | ''R'' } is a game.

Addition, negation, and comparison are all defined the same way for both surreal numbers and games.

Every surreal number is a game, but not all games are surreal numbers, e.g. the game [[star (game theory)|{ '''0''' | '''0''' }]] is not a surreal number.  The class of games is more general than the surreals, and has a simpler definition, but lacks some of the nicer properties of surreal numbers.  The class of surreal numbers forms a [[field (mathematics)|field]], but the class of games does not.  The surreals have a [[total order]]: given any two surreals, they are either equal, or one is greater than the other.  The games have only a [[partial order]]: there exist pairs of games that are neither equal, greater than, nor less than each other.  Each surreal number is either positive, negative, or zero.  Each game is either positive, negative, ''[[zero game|zero]]'', or ''[[fuzzy game|fuzzy]]'' (incomparable with zero, such as {1|−1}).

A move in a game involves the player whose move it is choosing a game from those available in L (for the left player) or R (for the right player) and then passing this chosen game to the other player.  A player who cannot move because the choice is from the empty set has lost. A positive game represents a win for the left player, a negative game for the right player, a zero game for the second player to move, and a [[fuzzy game]] for the first player to move.

If ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are surreals, and ''x''=''y'', then ''x'' ''z''=''y'' ''z''.  However, if ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are games, and ''x''=''y'', then it is not always true that ''x'' ''z''=''y'' ''z''.  Note that "=" here means equality, not identity.

==Application to combinatorial game theory==

The surreal numbers were originally motivated by studies of the game [[Go (board game)|Go]],&lt;ref name="O'Connor"/&gt; and there are numerous connections between popular games and the surreals.  In this section, we will use a capitalized ''Game'' for the mathematical object {L|R}, and the lowercase ''game'' for recreational games like [[Chess]] or [[Go (board game)|Go]].

We consider games with these properties:
* Two players (named ''Left'' and ''Right'')
* [[Deterministic]] (the game at each step will completely depend on the choices the players make, rather than a random factor)
* No hidden information (such as cards or tiles that a player hides)
* Players alternate taking turns (the game may or may not allow multiple moves in a turn)
* Every game must end in a finite number of moves
* As soon as there are no legal moves left for a player, the game ends, and that player loses

For most games, the initial board position gives no great advantage to either player.  As the game progresses and one player starts to win, board positions will occur in which that player has a clear advantage.  For analyzing games, it is useful to associate a Game with every board position.  The value of a given position will be the Game {L|R}, where L is the set of values of all the positions that can be reached in a single move by Left. Similarly, R is the set of values of all the positions that can be reached in a single move by Right.

The zero Game (called 0) is the Game where L and R are both empty, so the player to move next (L or R) immediately loses. The sum of two Games G = { L1 | R1 } and H = { L2 | R2 } is defined as the Game G + H = { L1 + H, G + L2 | R1 + H, G + R2 } where the player to move chooses which of the Games to play in at each stage, and the loser is still the player who ends up with no legal move. One can imagine two chess boards between two players, with players making moves alternatively, but with complete freedom as to which board to play on. If G is the Game {L | R}, -G is the game {-R | -L}, i.e. with the role of the two players reversed. It is easy to show G - G = 0 for all Games G (where G -  H is defined as G + (-H)).

This simple way to associate Games with games yields a very interesting result.  Suppose two perfect players play a game starting with a given position whose associated Game is ''x''.  We can classify all Games into four classes as follows:

* If x &gt; 0 then Left will win, regardless of who plays first.
* If x &lt; 0 then Right will win, regardless of who plays first.
* If x = 0 then the player who goes second will win.
* If x || 0 then the player who goes first will win.

More generally, we can define G &gt; H as G - H &gt; 0, and similarly for &lt;, = and ||.

The notation G || H means that G and H are incomparable.  G || H is equivalent to G−H || 0, i.e. that G &gt; H, G &lt; H and G = H are all false.   Incomparable games are sometimes said to be ''confused'' with each other, because one or the other may be preferred by a player depending on what is added to it.  A game confused with zero is said to be [[fuzzy game|fuzzy]], as opposed to [[sign (mathematics)|positive, negative, or zero]]. An example of a fuzzy game is [[star (game theory)|star (*)]].

Sometimes when a game nears the end, it will decompose into several smaller games that do not interact, except in that each player's turn allows moving in only one of them.  For example, in Go, the board will slowly fill up with pieces until there are just a few small islands of empty space where a player can move.  Each island is like a separate game of Go, played on a very small board.  It would be useful if each subgame could be analyzed separately, and then the results combined to give an analysis of the entire game.  This doesn't appear to be easy to do.  For example, you might have two subgames where whoever moves first wins, but when they are combined into one big game, it's no longer the first player who wins.  Fortunately, there is a way to do this analysis.  Just use the following remarkable theorem:

:If a big game decomposes into two smaller games, and the small games have associated Games of ''x'' and ''y'', then the big game will have an associated Game of ''x''+''y''.

A game composed of smaller games is called the [[disjunctive sum]] of those smaller games, and the theorem states that the method of addition we defined is equivalent to taking the disjunctive sum of the addends.

Historically, Conway developed the theory of surreal numbers in the reverse order of how it has been presented here.  He was analyzing [[Go terms#Yose|Go endgames]], and realized that it would be useful to have some way to combine the analyses of non-interacting subgames into an analysis of their [[disjunctive sum]].  From this he invented the concept of a Game and the addition operator for it.  From there he moved on to developing a definition of negation and comparison.  Then he noticed that a certain class of Games had interesting properties; this class became the surreal numbers.  Finally, he developed the multiplication operator, and proved that the surreals are actually a field, and that it includes both the reals and ordinals.

==Alternative realizations==

The name surreal number was first used by Conway in 1972, but there are several alternative constructions developed both before and after that.

===Sign expansion===

====Definitions====

In what is now called the ''sign-expansion'' or ''sign-sequence'' of a surreal number, a surreal number is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose [[domain of a function|domain]] is an [[ordinal number|ordinal]] and whose [[codomain]] is { −1, +1 }.&lt;ref name=G1986 /&gt;{{rp|at=ch. 2}} This is equivalent to Conway's L-R sequences.&lt;ref name="Con01" /&gt;

Define the binary predicate "simpler than" on numbers by ''x'' is simpler than ''y'' if ''x'' is a [[subset|proper subset]] of ''y'', ''i.e.'' if dom(''x'') &amp;lt; dom(''y'') and ''x''(α) = ''y''(α) for all α &amp;lt; dom(''x'').

For surreal numbers  define the binary relation &amp;lt; to be lexicographic order (with the convention that "undefined values" are greater than &amp;minus;1 and less than 1). So ''x'' &amp;lt; ''y'' if one of the following holds:
* ''x'' is simpler than ''y'' and ''y''(dom(''x'')) = + 1;
* ''y'' is simpler than ''x'' and ''x''(dom(''y'')) = − 1;
* there exists a number ''z'' such that ''z'' is simpler than ''x'', ''z'' is simpler than ''y'', ''x''(dom(''z'')) = − 1 and ''y''(dom(''z'')) = + 1.

Equivalently, let δ(''x'',''y'') = min({ dom(''x''), dom(''y'')} ∪ { α :
α &amp;lt; dom(''x'') ∧ α &amp;lt; dom(''y'') ∧ ''x''(α) ≠ ''y''(α) }),
so that ''x'' = ''y'' if and only if δ(''x'',''y'') = dom(''x'') = dom(''y'').  Then, for numbers ''x'' and ''y'', ''x'' &amp;lt; ''y'' if and only if one of the following holds:
* δ(''x'',''y'') = dom(''x'') ∧ δ(''x'',''y'') &amp;lt; dom(''y'') ∧ ''y''(δ(''x'',''y'')) = + 1;
* δ(''x'',''y'') &amp;lt; dom(''x'') ∧ δ(''x'',''y'') = dom(''y'') ∧ ''x''(δ(''x'',''y'')) = − 1;
* δ(''x'',''y'') &amp;lt; dom(''x'') ∧ δ(''x'',''y'') &amp;lt; dom(''y'') ∧ ''x''(δ(''x'',''y'')) = − 1 ∧ ''y''(δ(''x'',''y'')) = + 1.

For numbers ''x'' and ''y'', ''x'' ≤ ''y'' if and only if ''x'' &amp;lt; ''y'' ∨ ''x'' = ''y'', and ''x'' &amp;gt; ''y'' if and only if ''y'' &amp;lt; ''x''. Also ''x'' ≥ ''y'' if and only if ''y'' ≤ ''x''.

The relation &amp;lt; is [[transitive relation|transitive]], and for all numbers ''x'' and ''y'', exactly one of ''x'' &amp;lt; ''y'', ''x'' = ''y'', ''x'' &amp;gt; ''y'', holds (law of [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy]]).  This means that &amp;lt; is a [[linear order]] (except that &amp;lt; is a proper class).

For sets of numbers, ''L'' and ''R'' such that ∀''x'' ∈ ''L'' ∀''y'' ∈ ''R'' (''x'' &amp;lt; ''y''), there exists a unique number ''z'' such that
* ∀''x'' ∈ ''L'' (''x'' &amp;lt; ''z'') ∧ ∀''y'' ∈ ''R'' (''z'' &amp;lt; ''y''),
* For any number ''w'' such that ∀''x'' ∈ ''L'' (''x'' &amp;lt; ''w'') ∧ ∀''y'' ∈ ''R'' (''w'' &amp;lt; ''y''), ''w'' = ''z'' or ''z'' is simpler than ''w''.

Furthermore, ''z'' is constructible from ''L'' and ''R'' by transfinite induction.  ''z'' is the simplest number between ''L'' and ''R''.  Let the unique number ''z'' be denoted by σ(''L'',''R'').

For a number ''x'', define its left set ''L''(''x'') and right set ''R''(''x'') by
* ''L''(''x'') = { ''x''|&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; : α &amp;lt; dom(''x'') ∧ ''x''(α) = + 1 };
* ''R''(''x'') = { ''x''|&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; : α &amp;lt; dom(''x'') ∧ ''x''(α) = − 1 },

then σ(''L''(''x''),''R''(''x'')) = ''x''.

One advantage of this alternative realization is that equality is identity, not an inductively defined relation. Unlike Conway's realization of the surreal numbers, however, the sign-expansion requires a prior construction of the ordinals, while in Conway's realization, the ordinals are constructed as particular cases of surreals.

However, similar definitions can be made that eliminate the need for prior construction of the ordinals.  For instance, we could let the surreals be the (recursively-defined) class of functions whose domain is a subset of the surreals satisfying the transitivity rule ∀''g'' ∈ dom ''f''  (∀''h'' ∈ dom ''g'' (''h'' ∈ dom ''f'' )) and whose range is { −, + }.  "Simpler than" is very simply defined now&amp;mdash;''x'' is simpler than ''y''  if ''x'' ∈ dom ''y''.  The total ordering is defined by considering ''x'' and ''y'' as sets of ordered pairs (as a function is normally defined):  Either ''x'' = ''y'',  or else the surreal number ''z'' = ''x'' ∩ ''y''  is in the domain of ''x''  or the domain of ''y''  (or both, but in this case the signs must disagree).  We then have ''x'' &lt; ''y''  if ''x''(''z'') = − or ''y''(''z'') = + (or both).  Converting these functions into sign sequences is a straightforward task; arrange the elements of dom ''f''  in order of simplicity (i.e., inclusion), and then write down the signs that ''f'' assigns to each of these elements in order.  The ordinals then occur naturally as those surreal numbers whose range is { + }.

====Addition and multiplication====

The sum ''x'' + ''y'' of two numbers, ''x'' and ''y'', is defined by induction on dom(''x'') and dom(''y'') by ''x'' + ''y'' = σ(''L'',''R''), where
* ''L'' = { ''u'' + ''y'' : ''u'' ∈ ''L''(''x'') } ∪{ ''x'' + ''v'' : ''v'' ∈ ''L''(''y'') },
* ''R'' = { ''u'' + ''y'' : ''u'' ∈ ''R''(''x'') } ∪{ ''x'' + ''v'' : ''v'' ∈ ''R''(''y'') }.

The additive identity is given by the number 0 = { }, ''i.e.'' the number 0 is the unique function whose domain is the ordinal 0, and the additive inverse of the number ''x'' is the number − ''x'', given by dom(− ''x'') = dom(''x''), and, for α &amp;lt; dom(''x''), (− ''x'')(α) = − 1 if ''x''(α) = + 1, and (− ''x'')(α) = + 1 if ''x''(α) = − 1.

It follows that a number ''x'' is [[Positive number|positive]] if and only if 0 &amp;lt; dom(''x'') and ''x''(0) = + 1, and ''x'' is [[negative number|negative]] if and only if 0 &amp;lt; dom(''x'') and ''x''(0) = − 1.

The product ''xy'' of two numbers, ''x'' and ''y'', is defined by induction on dom(''x'') and dom(''y'') by ''xy'' = σ(''L'',''R''), where
* ''L'' = { ''uy'' + ''xv'' − ''uv'' : ''u'' ∈ ''L''(''x''), ''v'' ∈ ''L''(''y'') } ∪ { ''uy'' + ''xv'' − ''uv'' : ''u'' ∈ ''R''(''x''), ''v'' ∈ ''R''(''y'') },
* ''R'' = { ''uy'' + ''xv'' − ''uv'' : ''u'' ∈ ''L''(''x''), ''v'' ∈ ''R''(''y'') } ∪ { ''uy'' + ''xv'' − ''uv'' : ''u'' ∈ ''R''(''x''), ''v'' ∈ ''L''(''y'') }.

The multiplicative identity is given by the number 1 = { (0,+ 1) }, ''i.e.'' the number 1 has domain equal to the ordinal 1, and 1(0) = + 1.

====Correspondence with Conway====

The map from Conway's realization to sign expansions is given by ''f''({ ''L'' | ''R'' }) = σ(''M'',''S''), where ''M'' = { ''f''(''x'') : ''x'' ∈ ''L'' } and ''S'' = { ''f''(''x'') : ''x'' ∈ ''R'' }.

The inverse map from the alternative realization to Conway's realization is given by ''g''(''x'') = { ''L'' | ''R'' }, where ''L'' = { ''g''(''y'') : ''y'' ∈ ''L''(''x'') } and ''R'' = { ''g''(''y'') : ''y'' ∈ ''R''(''x'') }.

===Axiomatic approach===

In another approach to the surreals, given by Alling,&lt;ref name="Alling" /&gt;  explicit construction is bypassed altogether. Instead, a set of axioms is given that any particular approach to the surreals must satisfy. Much like the [[Real numbers#Axiomatic approach|axiomatic approach]] to the reals, these axioms guarantee uniqueness up to isomorphism.

A triple &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf{No}, \mathrm{&lt;}, b \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a surreal number system if and only if the following hold:

* &lt; is a [[total order]] over '''No'''
* ''b'' is a function from '''No''' onto the class of all ordinals (''b'' is called the "birthday function" on '''No''').
* Let ''A'' and ''B'' be subclasses of '''No''' such that for all ''x'' ∈ ''A'' and ''y'' ∈ ''B'', ''x'' &lt; ''y'' (using Alling's terminology, 〈 ''A'',''B'' 〉 is a "Conway cut" of '''No'''). Then there exists a unique ''z'' ∈ '''No''' such that ''b(z)'' is minimal and for all ''x'' ∈ ''A'' and all ''y'' ∈ ''B'', ''x'' &lt; ''z'' &lt; ''y''. (This axiom is often referred to as "Conway's Simplicity Theorem".)
* Furthermore, if an ordinal ''α'' is greater than ''b(x)'' for all ''x'' ∈ ''A'', ''B'', then ''b(z)'' ≤ ''α''. (Alling calls a system that satisfies this axiom a "full surreal number system".)

Both Conway's original construction and the sign-expansion construction of surreals satisfy these axioms.

Given these axioms, Alling&lt;ref name="Alling"/&gt; derives Conway's original definition of ≤ and develops surreal arithmetic.

===Simplicity hierarchy===

A construction of the surreal numbers as a maximal binary pseudo-tree with simplicity (ancestor) and ordering relations is due to [[Philip Ehrlich]],&lt;ref name="Ehr12"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference from the usual definition of a tree is that the set of ancestors of a vertex is well-ordered, but may not have a maximal element (immediate predecessor); in other words the order type of that set is a general ordinal number, not just a natural number. This construction fulfills Alling's axioms as well and can easily be mapped to the sign-sequence representation.

===Hahn series===

Alling&lt;ref name="Alling" /&gt;{{rp|at=th. 6.55, p. 246}} also proves that the field of surreal numbers is isomorphic (as an ordered field) to the field of [[Hahn series]] with real coefficients on the value group of surreal numbers themselves (the series representation corresponding to the normal form of a surreal number, as defined above).  This provides a connection between surreal numbers and more conventional mathematical approaches to ordered field theory.

This isomorphism makes the surreal numbers into a valued field where the valuation is the additive inverse of the exponent of the leading term in the Conway normal form, e.g., ν(ω) = -1. The valuation ring then consists of the finite surreal numbers (numbers with a real and/or an infinitesimal part). The reason for the sign inversion is that the exponents in the Conway normal form constitute a reverse well-ordered set, whereas Hahn series are formulated in terms of (non-reversed) well-ordered subsets of the value group.

==Relation to hyperreals==
Philip Ehrlich has constructed an isomorphism between Conway's maximal surreal number field and the maximal [[hyperreal field|hyperreals]] in [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]].&lt;ref name="Ehr12" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4386">A '''sustainable community energy system''' is an integrated approach to supplying a local community with its energy requirements from [[renewable energy]] or high-efficiency [[co-generation]] energy sources. The approach can be seen as a development of the [[distributed generation]] concept.

Such systems are based on a combination of [[district heating]], [[district cooling]], plus '[[electricity generation island]]s' that are interlinked via a private wire electricity system (largely bypassing the normal [[power grid]] to cut transmission losses and charges, as well as increasing the robustness of the system). The surplus from one generating island can therefore be used to make up the deficit at another.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] the first sustainable community energy system was pioneered by [[Woking]] [[Borough]] [[Municipality|Council]], starting in 1991. The system uses traditional and a [[Phosphoric-acid fuel cell|phosphoric acid fuel cell]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060911140743/http://www.woking.gov.uk/html/queensaward/W-19.pdf] co-generation plants, [[thermal store|thermal storage]], heat fired [[absorption cooling]] and [[photovoltaics]] (over 9% of the UK's small capacity), to supply both residential and non-residential customers, as well as the Council's own facilities. By end of 2005 there were over 60 generating islands in the Borough.

Despite the investment in the plant, the system delivers cheaper energy than can be supplied from the traditional 'brown energy' suppliers, helping to tackle [[fuel poverty]]. It is part of a plan to cut local [[carbon dioxide]] emissions by 80% by 2050. Their initiatives won the Council the [[Queen's Award for Enterprise]] in 2002 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070102051259/http://www.woking.gov.uk/news/archive?item=988025744].

The [[London Climate Change Agency]] is starting to construct a similar system in [[London]].

==Germany==
In 1997, people of [[Wildpoldsried]], in some cases acting as individuals, began a series of projects that produce renewable energy. The first efforts were [[wind turbine]]s and [[biomass]] digesters for [[cogeneration]] of heat and power.  In the time since, new work has included a number of [[energy conservation]] projects, more wind and biomass use, [[small hydro]] plants, [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic panels]] on private houses, and [[district heating]].  Tied to this are ecological [[flood control]] and [[wastewater]] systems.

Today, the effects of this are an unforeseen level of prosperity resulting in construction of nine new community buildings, including a school, gymnasium, and community hall, complete with solar panels.  There are three companies operating four biogas digesters with a fifth under construction.  There are seven windmills with two more on the way. One hundred and ninety private households are equipped with solar, which pays them dividends.  The district heating network has 42 connections.  There are three small hydro power plants. Wildpoldsried now produces 321 percent more energy than it needs and is generating 4.0 million Euro in annual revenue.  At the same time, there has been a 65% reduction in the town’s carbon footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=German Village Achieves Energy Independence … And Then Some  |publisher=BioCycle |date=August 2011 |volume= 52, No. 8, p. 37 |url=http://www.biocycle.net/2011/08/german-village-achieves-energy-independence-and-then-some/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8734">A '''value judgment''' (or '''value judgement''') is a [[judgment]] of the [[right (ethics)|rightness]] or [[wrong]]ness of something or someone, or of the [[usefulness]] of something or someone, based on a comparison or other relativity. As a generalization, a value judgment can refer to a judgment based upon a particular set of [[Values#Personal and cultural values|values]] or on a particular [[value system]]. A related meaning of value judgment is an expedient evaluation based upon limited information at hand, an evaluation undertaken because a decision must be made on short notice.

==Explanation==
The term ''value judgment'' can be used objectively to refer to any injunction that implies an obligation to carry out an act, implicitly involving the terms "ought" or "should". It can be used either in a positive sense, signifying that a judgment must be made taking a value system into account, or in a disparaging sense, signifying a judgment made by personal whim rather than [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] thought or evidence.&lt;ref name=Schaffner&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Scriven (KF Schaffner &amp; RS Cohen, eds.) |title=Philosophy of Science Association PSA: Boston studies in the philosophy of science, v. 20 |page=219 ff |publisher=Dordrecht:Reidel |location=Boston |year=1974 |isbn=90-277-0408-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhY1vAIbdakC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=%22value+judgment%22#PPA219,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its positive sense, a recommendation to make a value judgment is an admonition to consider carefully, to avoid whim and impetuousness, and search for consonance with one's deeper convictions, and to search for an objective, [[Authentication|verifiable]], public, and consensual set of evidence for the [[opinion]].

In its disparaging sense the term ''value judgment'' implies a conclusion is insular, one-sided, and not objective — contrasting with judgments based upon deliberation, balance and public evidence.

''Value judgment'' also can refer to a tentative judgment based on a considered appraisal of the information at hand, taken to be incomplete and evolving—for example, a ''value judgment'' on whether to launch a military attack, or as to procedure in a medical emergency.&lt;ref name=Shrader-Frechette&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Kristin Shrader-Frechette]] (Cohen, R.S., Gavroglou, K., Stachel, J.J., &amp; Wartofsky, M.W., eds.) |title=The case of Yucca Mountain: Science, politics and social practice |page=204 ff |publisher=Springer |location= Dordrecht/New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-7923-2989-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZIo86_X2FAcC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=%22value+judgment%22#PPA204,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the quality of judgment suffers because the information available is incomplete as a result of exigency, rather than as a result of cultural or personal limitations.

Most commonly the term ''value judgment'' refers to an individual's [[opinion]]. Of course, the individual's opinion is formed to a degree by their belief system, and the culture to which they belong. So a natural extension of the term ''value judgment'' is to include declarations seen one way from one value system, but may be seen differently from another. Conceptually this extension of definition is related both to the [[anthropological]] axiom "[[cultural relativism]]" (that is, that cultural meaning derives from a context) and to the term "[[moral relativism]]" (that is, that moral and ethical propositions are not universal truths, but stem from cultural context). A  value judgment formed within a specific value system may be parochial, and may be subject to dispute in a wider audience.

===Nonjudgmental===
 {{POV section|date=December 2012}}
 {{See also|Amorality}}
'''Nonjudgmental''' is a descriptor that conveys the opposite meaning to the pejorative{{Clarify|date=January 2013}} sense of value judgment: it expresses avoidance of personal opinion and reflex "knee-jerk" reactions.

'''Nonjudgmental''' implies open-mindedness, rejection of uninformed assumptions, and avoidance of blame. It may also suggest a capacity for compassion and empathy.

===Judgment call===
{{expand_section|date=September 2013}}
'''Judgment call''' is a term describing decision made on a personal basis.

===Value-neutral===
'''Value-neutral''' is a related adjective suggesting independence from a value system. The object itself is considered value-neutral when it is neither good nor bad, neither useful nor useless, neither significant nor trite, until placed in some social context. For example, the classification of an object sometimes depends upon context: Is an object a [[tool]] or a [[weapon]], is a human remain an [[Cultural artifact|artifact]] or an [[ancestor]]?

A famous quote from mathematician [[G.H. Hardy]] indicates how he places the "value-neutral" subject of mathematics into a particular social context:&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;{{cite book |title=Encarta Book of Quotations |author1=Bill Swainson |author2=Anne H. Soukhanov |page=408 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Af84fBmzmVYC&amp;pg=PA408&amp;lpg=PA408&amp;dq=Hardy+%22a+science+is+said+to+be+useful+if+its+development%22 |isbn=0312230001 |publisher=Macmillan |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|A science is said to be useful if its development tends to accentuate the existing inequalities of wealth, or more directly promotes the destruction of human life.|Godfrey Harold Hardy in ''A Mathematician's Apology'' (1941)}}

For a discussion of whether technology is value neutral, see Martin and Schinzinger,&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mike W Martin  |author2=Schinzinger R  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Ethics in engineering |page=279 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |edition=Fourth |location=Boston |year=2005 |isbn=0-07-283115-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=64iYMPnD3X0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=centrifugal+turntable&amp;cad=0#PPA12,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wallace.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Philip Russell Wallace]] |title=Physics |page=Chapter 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=64iYMPnD3X0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=centrifugal+turntable&amp;cad=0#PPA12,M1 |isbn=9971-5-0930-X |publisher=World Scientific |year=1991 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An item may have value and be value-neutral ''regardless'' of social context if its utility or importance is more-or-less self-evident, for example, oxygen supports life in all societies.

==Value judgements and their context==
Some argue that true objectivity is impossible, that even the most rigorous rational analysis is founded on the set of values accepted in the course of analysis.
&lt;ref name=Scriven&gt;
{{cite book |author=Michael Scriven |title=Proceedings of the 1972 Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association |chapter=Exact role of value judgments in science |editor1=Kenneth F. Schaffner |editor2=Robert Sonné Cohen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhY1vAIbdakC&amp;pg=PA237 |pages=237 ''ff'' |isbn=9027704082 |year=1974 |publisher=Springer}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Consequently, all conclusions are necessarily value judgments (and therefore may be parochial). Of course, putting all conclusions in one category does nothing to distinguish between them, and is therefore a useless descriptor. Categorizing a conclusion as a value judgment takes substance when the context framing the judgment is specified.
&lt;ref name=Cushan&gt;
{{cite book |author=Anna-Marie Cushan |title=Investigation into Facts and Values: Groundwork for a theory of moral conflict resolution |url=http://www.ondwelle.com/ValueJudgements.pdf |origyear=1983|year=2014 |publisher=Ondwelle: Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, scientific "truths" are considered objective, but are held tentatively, with the understanding that more careful evidence and/or wider experience might change matters. Further, a scientific view (in the sense of a conclusion based upon a value system) is a ''value judgment'' that is [[socially constructed]] based upon rigorous evaluation and wide consensus. With this example in mind, characterizing a view as a ''value judgment'' is vague without description of the context surrounding it.

However, as noted in the first segment of this article, in common usage the term ''value judgment'' has a much simpler meaning with context simply implied, not specified.

'''Vera Brown Starr''' (May 23, 1924 – March 4, 1985) was the first woman elected as chair of the [[Yavapai-Apache Nation]] and served two years in the office, as well as serving over fifteen years on the council. She was one of the delegates to the [[1977 National Women's Conference]], a major U.S. women's conference held in conjunction with the [[International Women's Year]] celebrations of the United Nations. In 2012, her name was inscribed on an arch recognizing women who were Native American leaders at the [[University of Arizona]].

==Early life==
Vera Brown was born on May 23, 1924 at the Indian Reservation of [[Camp Verde, Arizona]] to Mary and Sam Brown, members of the Mojave-[[Apache]]. She was the youngest of three siblings.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}}{{sfn|U.S. Indian Census|1934|p=8}} Her father was a miner, working in the United Verde Mine near [[Jerome, Arizona]] and the smelters in [[Clarkdale, Arizona|Clarkdale]] and [[Clemenceau, Arizona|Clemenceau]].{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} Until she was school age, the family lived in a ''[[Wigwam|wickiup]]'' near Clarkdale.{{sfn|Winters|1980|p=16}} She attended the segregated public school in Clarkdale, which allowed whites to attend in the mornings and [[Hispanic]]s and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] to attend afternoon classes and though she was placed in the morning session, she remembered experiencing discrimination and did not speak English.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}}{{sfn|Winters|1980|p=16}} When she was eleven, her father died on April 19, 1935, from [[silicosis]], having worked the mines without any protective respiratory equipment.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}}{{sfn|U.S. Indian Census|1934|p=8}} She was sent to the [[Valentine Indian School]] under the [[American Indian boarding schools|American Indian boarding school program]] and graduated from the Indian High School in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. Though she earned a scholarship to the [[University of New Mexico]], Brown returned to Carkdale to care for her mother because the pension her father earned had ended after one year and her mother was denied social security.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} 

After World War II, Brown married Antonio L. Moreno (1924–1968), a veteran and miner, from Clarkdale.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1968|p=80}} The couple originally made their home in Jerome, where their children Anthony Jr. (1948–2009) and Petra (1949–2011) were born.{{sfn|''Ajo Copper News''|2009|p=2}}{{sfn|''Ajo Copper News''|2011|p=2}} In 1949, they moved to [[Ajo, Arizona|Ajo]], where Antonio worked at the [[Phelps Dodge|Phelps-Dodge smelter]].{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1968|p=80}}

In 1967, against her mother's recommendation, Moreno decided to run for a seat on the tribal council of the [[Yavapai-Apache Nation]].{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} After her husband's death in 1968, Moreno remarried with Henry Starr.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} She was successful in attaining a seat in 1969 and served for six years, before becoming the first woman to serve as the Tribal Chair in 1975.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1975|p=27}}{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} After serving two-years as Tribal Chair, the 1977 election was fraught with factionalism, causing a contested election, a court battle, and finally a new vote.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|October 27, 1977|p=29}} Starr did not win her re-election bid as Chair.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|November 15, 1977|p=21}} 

Starr joined the [[North American Indian Women's Association]] (NAIWA), an organization formed to foster inter-tribal betterment for Native Americans.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} In 1977, she attended the [[1977 National Women's Conference|National Women's Conference]], which was held in conjunction with the [[United Nations]]' [[International Women's Year]] celebrations. As one of Arizona's four Native American delegates, of specific interest to her were the anti-discrimination resolution passed by the women which addressed minority rights, including the removal of American Indian children from their homes and tribes, as well as the discussion of the failure of Arizona to pass [[Medicaid]] legislation to provide health care to low-income families.{{sfn|Sowers|1977|p=2}}

Though defeated in her bid for re-election to the chair, Starr continued to serve on the council, being returned in 1978 as a council member.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1978|p=16}} In 1981, she was elected as treasurer of the tribe and held that post until her election as vice chair of the tribe in 1982.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1982|p=18}} She returned as vice chair in 1983.{{sfn|Funk|1983|p=21}} Issues on which she focused during her time on the council were those that would improve the lives of tribe members. She advocated for improved housing, health care initiatives, and protection of water rights.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}}{{sfn|Sowers|1977|p=2}}

==Death and legacy==
Starr died on March 4, 1985 in [[Cottonwood, Arizona]] at the Marcus J. Lawrence Memorial Hospital.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1985|p=38}} Posthumously, her name was inscribed in 2011 on the Native American Women of Arizona Arch on the [[University of Arizona]] campus,{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} after having been selected to represent their tribe by the Yavapai-Apache Nation.{{sfn|Ruiz-McGill|2012}}
