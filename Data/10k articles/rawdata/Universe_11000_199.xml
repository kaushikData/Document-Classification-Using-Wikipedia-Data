'''Adaptive fluid-infused porous films''' change states when stretched, allowing for dynamic control over [[transparency and translucency|transparency]] and [[wettability]]. They were developed by researchers at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="aizenberg" /&gt; The same team previously invented [[Slippery Liquid Infused Porous Surfaces]] (SLIPS) which served as the base technology to control [[wettability]] in Adaptive fluid-infused porous film.

== Description ==

The material is a thin [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] film that contains nano-sized [[Porosity|pores]]. When in a normal relaxed state, if droplets of [[liquid]] are applied to the film, they will roll freely along the smooth surface. However, when the film is stretched, any droplets of liquid that are applied to the film will be held in place on the film. If the [[Tension (physics)|tension]] on the film is later released, the film will return to its normal relaxed state, and the droplet will again move along the smooth surface. The film also becomes more transparent when stretched, allowing the material to be dynamically controlled with regards to both the wettability and transparency of the material.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

The '''Agency for Renewable Resources''' ({{lang-de|Fachagentur Nachwachsende Rohstoffe e.V.}} or '''FNR'''), was founded in 1993 as a government initiative intended to support research and development in the area of [[renewable resources]]. As a project managing organisation, the FNR answers to the [[Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture]] (abbreviated BMEL in German). In May 2015, the BMEL announced the new ‘Renewable Resources’ funding programme. The Agency for Renewable Resources (FNR) has been entrusted with managing the programme. Currently, around 600 projects with a budget of 193 million euro are being funded by the FNR.

In 2016 the FNR manages 61 million euro provided from Germany’s Federal budget for the implementation of the funding programme. An additional 24.6 million euro are allocated for research and development in the field of bioenergy from the Special Energy and Climate Fund (EKF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fnr.de/fileadmin/allgemein/pdf/broschueren/FNR_Jahresbericht_2014-15_Web.pdf], FNR Jahresbericht 2014/15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''‘Renewable Resources‘ Funding Programme'''

The ‘Renewable Resources’ funding programme is part of the government’s new high-tech strategy to improve Germany’s competitive position. It also supports the government’s ‘Policy Strategy on Bioeconomy’, which aims to create a resource-efficient economy that makes use of renewable resources.

The programme is intended to support the further development of a sustainable bio-based economy. This involves developing innovative, internationally competitive bio-based products, as well as processes and technologies for their production. Furthermore, the programme also supports the development of concepts aimed at improving the sustainability of the bio-based economy, while taking society’s expectations into account.

== Structure ==
The FNR is a registered association. Its task is to effectively and continuously contribute to the research and development as well as the use of renewable resources taking into account conflicts of use, direct and indirect land use changes, biomass conversion processes as well as sustainability concepts.

The bodies of the FNR are

* the General Assembly, consisting of seven members who are entitled to vote and are part of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) as well as supporting members that perform a consultative function,
* the Managing Board,
* the Specialised Advisory Committee and the Managing Board of the Specialised Advisory Committee, as well as
* the Managing Director.

[http://www.fnr.de/fnr-ueber-uns/fnr/struktur/ Organisation chart]

== Tasks ==
=== Promotion of Research and Development ===
The FNR’s main task is to support applied research and development in the field of sustainable development and use of renewable resources. It is our goal to develop promising processes and products to make them ready for the market. The FNR supports around 6800 projects each year.

=== Information and Public Relations ===
The FNR is the first point of contact for all matters concerning renewable resources. Alongside specialist information, explanations and advice also play an important role. The FNR operates a variety of thematic portals providing information on the use of renewable resources. In addition, there are numerous publications available in the FNR’s media library. Regular events and industry and consumer expos round off the spectrum of activities.

=== EU and International Activities ===
As well as taking part in EU funded projects, the FNR is also involved in European and international committees and working groups that develop strategies for the sustainable use of biomass using innovative and efficient technologies.

== The Importance of Renewable Resources ==
Fossil resources like coal, mineral oil and gas decrease worldwide. Germany, like most industrial nations, has to focus more and more on alternative resources. This means that agricultural and forestry resources used in a substantial or energetic way can be a major contribution. Renewable resources are not only important for supply guarantee but also for climate protection.

'''Economic Factor of Renewable Resources'''

Cultivation and local and regional use of renewable resources support economic growth, added value and new jobs – especially in rural areas. They allow economic and social participation and will lead to an increase of quality of life for the people on the ground. Also in the industrial field, e.g. in the chemical industry, renewable resources are being used more and more and as a result new jobs can be provided.

== Miscellaneous ==
In a unique pilot project (2007–2010), the FNR, in cooperation with [[:de:Wikimedia Deutschland|Wikimedia Germany]] and the nova-Institute, implemented the first government-funded project in Wikipedia: the development of the [[:de:Wikipedia:WikiProjekt Nachwachsende Rohstoffe|thematic portal “Renewable Resources"]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fnr-server.de/ftp/pdf/berichte/22028206.pdf], Abschlussbericht für das Projekt „Nachwachsende Rohstoffe im Wikipedia-Online-Lexikon“&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32833">'''Algaculture''' is a form of [[aquaculture]] involving the farming of species of [[algae]].

The majority of algae that are intentionally cultivated fall into the category of [[microalgae]] (also referred to as [[phytoplankton]], [[microphytes]], or [[planktonic algae]]). [[Macroalgae]], commonly known as [[seaweed]], also have many commercial and industrial uses, but due to their size and the specific requirements of the environment in which they need to grow, they do not lend themselves as readily to cultivation (this may change, however, with the advent of newer seaweed cultivators, which are basically [[algae scrubber]]s using upflowing air bubbles in small containers).

Commercial and industrial algae cultivation has numerous uses, including production of food ingredients such as [[omega-3 fatty acids]] or natural food [[colorants]] and [[dyes]], [[food]], [[fertilizer]], [[bioplastics]], chemical feedstock (raw material), [[pharmaceuticals]], and [[algal fuel]], and can also be used as a means of [[pollution control]].

==Growing, harvesting, and processing algae==

===Monoculture===

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}

Most growers prefer monocultural production and go to considerable lengths to maintain the purity of their cultures. However, the microbiological contaminants are still under investigation. &lt;ref&gt;https://open.uct.ac.za/bitstream/item/26426/thesis_ebe_2016_mogale_motlalekgomo.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt;

With mixed cultures, one species comes to dominate over time and if a non-dominant species is believed to have particular value, it is necessary to obtain pure cultures in order to cultivate this species. Individual species cultures are also much needed for research purposes.

A common method of obtaining pure cultures is [[serial dilution]]. Cultivators dilute either a wild sample or a lab sample containing the desired algae with filtered water and introduce small aliquots (measures of this solution) into a large number of small growing containers. Dilution follows a microscopic examination of the source culture that predicts that a few of the growing containers contain a single cell of the desired species. Following a suitable period on a light table, cultivators again use the microscope to identify containers to start larger cultures.

Another approach is to use a special medium which excludes other organisms, including invasive algae.  For example, ''[[Dunaliella]]'' is a commonly grown genus of microalgae which flourishes in extremely salty water that few other organisms can tolerate.
  
Alternatively, mixed algae cultures can work well for larval [[mollusks]]. First, the cultivator filters the sea water to remove algae which are too large for the [[larva]]e to eat. Next, the cultivator adds nutrients and possibly [[Aerated waters|aerates]] the result. After one or two days in a greenhouse or outdoors, the resulting thin soup of mixed algae is ready for the larvae. An advantage of this method is low maintenance.

===Growing algae===
{{See also|Seaweed cultivator|Culture of microalgae in hatcheries}}
[[File:Brine shrimp cyst.jpg|frame|Microalgae is used to culture [[brine shrimp]], which produce dormant eggs (pictured). The eggs can then be hatched on demand and fed to cultured fish larvae and crustaceans.]]
Water, [[carbon dioxide]], minerals and light are all important factors in cultivation, and different algae have different requirements. The basic reaction for algae growth in water is carbon dioxide + light energy + water = glucose + oxygen + water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coolclassroom.org/cool_projects/lessons/biology/resources.html Biology Resources]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is called ''[[autotrophic]]'' growth.  It is also possible to grow certain types of algae without light, these types of algae consume sugars (such as glucose). This is known as ''[[heterotrophic]]'' growth.

====Temperature====
The water must be in a temperature range that will support the specific algal species being grown mostly between 15˚C and 35˚C.

====Light and mixing====
In a typical algal-cultivation system, such as an open pond, light only penetrates the top {{convert|3|to(-)|4|in}} of the water, though this depends on the algae density. As the algae grow and multiply, the culture becomes so dense that it blocks light from reaching deeper into the water. Direct sunlight is too strong for most algae, which can use only about {{frac|10}} the amount of light they receive from direct sunlight; however, exposing an algae culture to direct sunlight (rather than shading it) is often the best course for strong growth, as the algae underneath the surface is able to utilize more of the less intense light created from the shade of the algae above.

To use deeper ponds, growers agitate the water, circulating the algae so that it does not remain on the surface. [[Paddlewheel aerator|Paddle wheel]]s can stir the water and [[compressed air]] coming from the bottom lifts algae from the lower regions. Agitation also helps prevent over-exposure to the sun.

Another means of supplying light is to place the light ''in'' the system. [[Glow plate]]s made from sheets of plastic or glass and placed within the [[tank]] offer precise control over light intensity, and distribute it more evenly.  They are seldom used, however, due to high cost.

====Odor and oxygen====
The odor associated with [[bogs]], [[swamps]], indeed any stagnant waters, can be due to oxygen depletion caused by the decay of deceased [[algal bloom]]s. Under [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] conditions, the bacteria inhabiting algae cultures break down the organic material and produce [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[ammonia]] which causes the odor. This [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] often results in the death of aquatic animals. In a system where algae is intentionally cultivated, maintained, and harvested, neither [[eutrophication]] nor hypoxia are likely to occur.

Some living algae and bacteria, also produce odorous chemicals, particularly certain ([[cyanobacteria]]) (previously classed as blue-green algae) such as ''[[Anabaena]]''. The most well-known of these odor-causing chemicals are MIB ([[2-methylisoborneol]]) and [[geosmin]]. They give a musty or earthy odor that can be quite strong. Eventual death of the cyanobacteria releases additional gas that is trapped in the cells. These chemicals are detectable at very low levels, in the parts per billion range, and are responsible for many "taste and odor" issues in [[drinking water]] treatment and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;"A Guide to Geosmin and MIB-producing Cyanobacteria in the United States", Izaguirre and Taylor, [[Water Science Technology]] 2004, 49(9):19-24&lt;/ref&gt; Cyanobacteria can also produce chemical toxins that have been a problem in drinking water.

====Nutrients====
Nutrients such as [[nitrogen]] (N), [[phosphorus]] (P), and [[potassium]] (K) serve as fertilizer for algae, and are generally necessary for growth. Silica and iron, as well as several trace elements, may also be considered important marine nutrients as the lack of one can limit the growth of, or productivity in, a given area.  Carbon dioxide is also essential; usually an input of CO2 is required for fast-paced algal growth. These elements must be dissolved into the water, in bio-available forms, for algae to grow.

====Pond and bioreactor cultivation methods====
Algae can be cultured in open ponds (such as [[raceway pond|raceway-type ponds]] and lakes) and [[photobioreactor]]s. Raceway ponds may be less expensive.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

=====Open ponds=====
[[File:Microalgenkwekerij te Heure bij Borculo.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Raceway pond]] used to cultivate microalgae. The water is kept in constant motion with a powered [[Paddlewheel aerator|paddle wheel]].]]
[[Raceway pond|Raceway-type ponds]] and lakes are open to the elements. Open ponds are highly vulnerable to contamination by other microorganisms, such as other algal species or bacteria. Thus cultivators usually choose closed systems for monocultures. Open systems also do not offer control over temperature and lighting. The growing season is largely dependent on location and, aside from tropical areas, is limited to the warmer months.

Open pond systems are cheaper to construct, at the minimum requiring only a trench or pond. Large ponds have the largest production capacities relative to other systems of comparable cost. Also, open pond cultivation can exploit unusual conditions that suit only specific algae. For instance, ''[[Dunaliella salina]]'' grow in extremely salty water; these unusual media exclude other types of organisms, allowing the growth of pure cultures in open ponds. Open culture can also work if there is a system of harvesting only the desired algae, or if the ponds are frequently re-inoculated before invasive organisms can multiply significantly.  The latter approach is frequently employed by [[Chlorella]] farmers, as the growth conditions for Chlorella do not exclude competing algae.

The former approach can be employed in the case of some chain [[diatom]]s since they can be filtered from a stream of water flowing through an [[wikt:outflow|outflow]] [[water pipe|pipe]]. A "[[pillow case]]" of a fine [[mesh]] cloth is tied over the outflow pipe allowing other algae to escape. The chain diatoms are held in the bag and feed [[wikt:shrimp|shrimp]] larvae (in Eastern [[hatchery|hatcheries]]) and [[inoculation|inoculate]] new tanks or ponds.

Enclosing a pond with a transparent or translucent barrier effectively turns it into a greenhouse. This solves many of the problems associated with an open system. It allows more species to be grown, it allows the species that are being grown to stay dominant, and it extends the growing season – if heated, the pond can produce year round. Open race way ponds were used for removal of lead using live ''Spirulina (Arthospira) sp''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siva Kiran | first1 = RR | last2 = Madhu | first2 = GM | last3 = Satyanarayana | first3 = SV | last4 = Kalpana | first4 = P | last5 = Bindiya | first5 = P | last6 = Subba Rangaiah | first6 = G | year = 2015 | title = Equilibrium and kinetic studies of lead biosorption by three ''Spirulina (Arthrospira) species'' in open raceway ponds | url = | journal = Journal of Biochemical Technology Vol | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 894–909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Photobioreactors=====
Algae can also be grown in a [[photobioreactor]] (PBR). A PBR is a [[bioreactor]] which incorporates a light source. Virtually any [[translucent]] container could be called a PBR; however, the term is more commonly used to define a closed system, as opposed to an open tank or pond.

Because PBR systems are closed, the cultivator must provide all nutrients, including {{chem|CO|2}}.

A PBR can operate in "[[Batch production|batch]] mode", which involves restocking the reactor after each harvest, but it is also possible to grow and harvest continuously. Continuous operation requires precise control of all elements to prevent immediate collapse. The grower provides sterilized water, nutrients, air, and carbon dioxide at the correct rates. This allows the reactor to operate for long periods. An advantage is that algae that grows in the "[[Bacterial growth|log phase]]" is generally of higher nutrient content than old "[[senescent]]" algae. Algal culture is the culturing of algae in ponds or other resources. Maximum productivity occurs when the "exchange rate" (time to exchange one volume of liquid) is equal to the "doubling time" (in mass or volume) of the algae.

Different types of PBRs include:
* [[Tank]]s
* [[Polyethylene]] sleeves or bags
* Glass or plastic [[cylinder (geometry)|tubes]].

===Harvesting===
[[File:Seaweed farming -Nusa Lembongan, Bali-16Aug2009 edit.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=A person stands in shallow water, gathering seaweed that has grown on a rope.|A seaweed farmer in [[Nusa Lembongan]] gathers edible seaweed that has grown on a rope.]]
Algae can be harvested using microscreens, by [[centrifugation]], by [[flocculation]]&lt;ref name="FlocculationMicroalgae"&gt;{{cite web|author1=D. Bilanovic |author2=A. Sukenik |author3=G. Shelef |year=1988 |url=http://www.bemidjistate.edu/dbilanovic/FlocculationIonicStrength.pdf |title=Flocculation of microalgae with cationic polymers. Effects of medium salinity |publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers Ltd, England |accessdate=2006-08-28 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[froth flotation]].

Interrupting the [[carbon dioxide]] supply can cause algae to flocculate on its own, which is called "autoflocculation".

"Chitosan", a commercial flocculant, more commonly used for water purification, is far more expensive. The powdered shells of [[crustaceans]] are processed to acquire [[chitin]], a [[polysaccharide]] found in the shells, from which chitosan is derived via de-acetylation. Water that is more [[brackish]], or saline requires larger amounts of flocculant. Flocculation is often too expensive for large operations.

[[Alum]] and [[ferric chloride]] are other chemical flocculants.

In [[froth]] flotation, the cultivator [[Aerated waters|aerates]] the water into a froth, and then skims the algae from the top.&lt;ref name="FrothingAlgaeHarvest"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Gilbert V. Levin |author2=John R. Clendenning |author3=Ahron Gibor |author4=Frederick D.

===Oil extraction===
{{Main|Algae fuel}}

Algae oils have a variety of commercial and industrial uses, and are extracted through a  variety of methods. Estimates of the cost to extract oil from microalgae vary, but are likely to be around three times higher than that of extracting [[palm oil]].&lt;ref name="chisti"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Chisti |first = Y. |title = Biodiesel from microalgae |journal = Biotechnology Advances |volume = 25 |pages = 294&amp;ndash;306 |year = 2007 |doi = 10.1016/j.biotechadv.2007.02.001 |pmid = 17350212 |issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physical extraction====
In the first step of extraction, the oil must be separated from the rest of the algae. The simplest method is mechanical [[crusher|crushing]]. When algae is dried it retains its oil content, which then can be "pressed" out with an [[oil press]]. Different [[strain (biology)|strain]]s of algae warrant different methods of oil pressing, including the use of screw, expeller and piston. Many commercial manufacturers of vegetable oil use a combination of mechanical pressing and chemical solvents in extracting oil. This use is often also adopted for algal oil extraction.

Osmotic shock is a sudden reduction in [[osmotic pressure]], this can cause cells in a solution to rupture. Osmotic shock is sometimes used to release cellular components, such as oil.

[[Ultrasound|Ultrasonic]] extraction, a branch of [[sonochemistry]], can greatly accelerate extraction processes. Using an ultrasonic reactor, ultrasonic waves are used to create [[cavitation]] bubbles in a solvent material.  When these bubbles collapse near the cell walls, the resulting [[shock waves]] and liquid jets cause those cells walls to break and release their contents into a solvent.&lt;ref name="Sonochemistry"&gt;{{cite web | year = | url = http://www.gov.pe.ca/ftc/index.php3?number=1024819&amp;lang=E |title = Sonochemistry | website = |publisher = Prince Edwards Island Government Food Technology Centre | accessdate = 2006-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sonication|Ultrasonication]] can enhance basic enzymatic extraction. The combination "sonoenzymatic treatment" accelerates extraction and increases yields.&lt;ref name="SonoenzymaticExtraction"&gt;{{cite web | year = | url = http://www.hielscher.com/ultrasonics/algae_extraction_01.htm#Ultrasonic_Enzymatic_Extraction | archive-url = https://archive.is/20071109192711/http://www.hielscher.com/ultrasonics/algae_extraction_01.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-11-09 |title = Ultrasonically assisted enzymatic extraction | website = |publisher = hielscher.com | accessdate = 2007-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chemical extraction====
[[Chemical solvents]] are often used in the extraction of the oils.  The downside to using solvents for oil extraction are the dangers involved in working with the chemicals. Care must be taken to avoid exposure to vapors and skin contact, either of which can cause serious health damage. Chemical solvents also present an explosion hazard.&lt;ref name="HexaneRisks"&gt;{{cite web|year= |url=http://www.healthfromthesun.com/HexaneFreePg.htm |title=Essential Fatty Acids and Herb FAQ's: What are the hazards of Hexane? |website= |publisher=Health From The Sun |accessdate=2006-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620174335/http://www.healthfromthesun.com/HexaneFreePg.htm |archivedate=2006-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common choice of [[chemical solvent]] is [[hexane]], which is widely used in the food industry and is relatively inexpensive. [[Benzene]] and [[ether]] can also separate oil.  Benzene is classified as a [[carcinogen]].

Another method of chemical solvent extraction is [[Soxhlet]] extraction.  In this method, oils from the algae are extracted through repeated washing, or [[percolation]], with an organic solvent such as [[hexane]] or [[petroleum ether]], under [[reflux]] in a special glassware.&lt;ref name="AutoSoxhletExtraction"&gt;{{cite web | year = | url = http://www.cyberlipid.org/extract/extr0010.htm |title = Automatic soxhlet extraction | website = |publisher = cyberlipid.org | accessdate = 2006-08-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060927163406/http://www.cyberlipid.org/extract/extr0010.htm| archivedate= 27 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The value of this technique is that the solvent is reused for each cycle.

[[Enzymatic]] extraction uses enzymes to degrade the cell walls with water acting as the solvent. This makes [[fractionation]] of the oil much easier. The costs of this extraction process are estimated to be much greater than hexane extraction.&lt;ref name="EnzymaticExtraction"&gt;{{cite web | year = | url = http://www.p2pays.org/ref/10/09365.htm |title = Aqueous Enzymatic Extraction of Oil from Rapeseeds | website = |publisher = Institute for Applied Environmental Economics | accessdate = 2006-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enzymatic extraction can be supported by ultrasonication. The combination "sonoenzymatic treatment" causes faster extraction and higher oil yields.&lt;ref name="SonoenzymaticExtraction"/&gt;

[[Supercritical fluid|Supercritical]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can also be used as a solvent.  In this method, [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is liquefied under pressure and heated to the point that it becomes supercritical (having properties of both a liquid and a gas), allowing it to act as a solvent.&lt;ref name="supercriticalfluids1"&gt;{{cite web|year= |url=http://www.supercriticalfluids.com/faqs.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215012744/http://www.supercriticalfluids.com/faqs.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-12-15 |title=How Do Supercritical Fluids Work? |website= |publisher=Supercritical Fluid Technologies |accessdate=2006-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="supercriticalfluids2"&gt;{{cite web| year= | url= http://www.phasex4scf.com/supercritical_markets/supercritical_fluids_nutraceuticals.htm| title= Nutraceuticals and Supercritical Fluid Applications: Production of Astaxanthin Concentrate| website= | publisher= Phasex| accessdate= 2006-08-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060827192259/http://www.phasex4scf.com/supercritical_markets/supercritical_fluids_nutraceuticals.htm| archivedate= 27 August 2006| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods are still being developed, including ones to extract specific types of oils, such as those with a high production of long-chain highly unsaturated fatty acids.&lt;ref name="UltrasoundAlgaeHarvest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AlgaeHarvestNewMethods" /&gt;

==Algal culture collections==
Specific algal strains can be acquired from algal culture collections, with over 500 culture collections registered with the World Federation for Culture Collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wdcm.nig.ac.jp/hpcc.html|title=Home Pages of Culture Collections in the World|date=10 December 2009|accessdate=10 December 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121031600/http://wdcm.nig.ac.jp/hpcc.html|archivedate=21 November 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of algae==
[[Image:Dulse.JPG|thumb|right|Dulse is one of many edible algae.]]

===Food===
Several species of algae are raised for food.

* Purple laver (''[[Porphyra]]'') is perhaps the most widely domesticated marine algae.&lt;ref name="Mumford 88"&gt;Mumford, T.F. and Miura, A. 4.''Porphyra'' as food: cultivation and economics. in Lembi, C.A. and Waaland, J.R. 1988. ''Algae and Human Affairs.'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. {{ISBN|0-521-32115-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Asia it is used in [[nori]] ([[Japan]]) and [[gim (food)|gim]] ([[Korea]]). In [[Wales]], it is used in [[laverbread]], a traditional food, and in [[Ireland]] it is collected and made into a [[Gel|jelly]] by [[stewing]] or [[boiling]]. Preparation also can involve frying or heating the [[frond]]s with a little water and beating with a fork to produce a pinkish jelly. Harvesting also occurs along the west coast of [[North America]], and in [[Hawaii]] and [[New Zealand]].
* Dulse (''[[Palmaria palmata]]'') is a red species sold in [[Ireland]] and Atlantic [[Canada]]. It is eaten raw, fresh, dried, or cooked like spinach.
* [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]] (''Arthrospira platensis'') is a blue-green microalgae with a long history as a food source in East Africa and pre-colonial Mexico. Spirulina is high in protein and other nutrients, finding use as a food supplement and for malnutrition. Spirulina thrives in open systems and commercial growers have found it well-suited to cultivation. One of the largest production sites is [[Lake Texcoco]] in central Mexico.&lt;ref name="KickingImp"&gt;{{cite web | year = | url = http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/98/0731/feat_2.html |title = The Imp With a Mighty Kick | website = |publisher = Asia Week| accessdate = 2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plants produce a variety of nutrients and high amounts of [[protein]]. Spirulina is often used commercially as a nutritional supplement.&lt;ref name="sbalgae"&gt;{{cite web|year= |url=http://www.sbgalgae.com/afa.htm |title=Aphanizomenon Flos-Aquae Blue Green Algae |website= |publisher=Energy For Life Wellness Center |accessdate=2006-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426144221/http://www.sbgalgae.com/afa.htm |archivedate=2006-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="microalgaenutrition"&gt;{{cite web | year = | url = http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/003/W3732E/w3732e07.htm |title = Nutritional value of micro-algae | website = |publisher = United States Fisheries Department| accessdate = 2006-08-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060826055621/http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/003/W3732E/w3732e07.htm| archivedate= 26 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Best benefit of Spirulina is the high pH of the culture medium, which can vary in 6-13. The high pH will not allow other microbes to reproduce. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bashanfoundation.org/vonshak/2002-.Vonshak-S.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chlorella]], another popular microalgae, has similar nutrition to spirulina. Chlorella is very popular in [[Japan]]. It is also used as a nutritional supplement with possible effects on metabolic rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalways.com/chlorella-growth-factor.htm|title=Chlorella Growth Factor, nutritional supplement.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some allege that Chlorella can reduce mercury levels in humans (supposedly by [[chelation]] of the mercury to the [[cell wall]] of the organism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autismwebsite.com/ari/dan/heavymetals.pdf |title=Treatment Options for Mercury/Metal Toxicity in Autism and Related Developmental Disabilities: Consensus Position Paper |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703041723/http://www.autismwebsite.com/ARI/dan/heavymetals.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Irish moss (''[[Chondrus crispus]]''), often confused with ''[[Mastocarpus stellatus]]'', is the source of [[carrageenan]], which is used as a stiffening agent in instant puddings, sauces, and dairy products such as ice cream. Irish moss is also used by beer brewers as a [[finings|fining]] agent.
* [[Sea lettuce]] (''[[Ulva lactuca]]''), is used in [[Scotland]] where it is added to soups and salads.
* Dabberlocks or badderlocks (''[[Alaria esculenta]]'') is eaten either fresh or cooked in [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], Scotland and Ireland.
* [[Aphanizomenon flos-aquae]] is a [[cyanobacteria]] similar to spirulina, which is used as a nutritional supplement.
* Extracts and oils from algae are also used as additives in various food products.&lt;ref name="algaeicecream"&gt;{{cite web|year= |url=http://ift.confex.com/ift/2005/techprogram/paper_31527.htm |title=Sensory properties of strawberry- and vanilla-flavored ice cream supplemented with an algae oil emulsion |website= |publisher=Dept. of Food Science, [[Pennsylvania State University]] |accessdate=2006-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506011358/http://ift.confex.com/ift/2005/techprogram/paper_31527.htm |archivedate=2007-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plants also produce [[Omega-3]] and [[Omega-6]] [[fatty acids]], which are commonly found in [[fish oils]], and which have been shown to have positive health benefits.&lt;ref name="ISBNews"&gt;{{cite web | year = | url = http://www.isb.vt.edu/news/2004/artspdf/jul0403.pdf |title = Transgenic Plants Produce Omega-3 and Omega-6 Fatty Acids | website = |publisher = School of Biology and Biochemistry, [[University of Bath]], England, UK| accessdate = 2006-08-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060828040031/http://www.isb.vt.edu/news/2004/artspdf/jul0403.pdf| archivedate= 28 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Sargassum  species are an important group of seaweeds. These algae have many [[phlorotannin]]s.
*  Cochayuyo ([[Durvillaea antarctica]]) is eaten in salads and ceviche in Peru and Chile.

===Fertilizer and agar===
For centuries [[seaweed]] has been used as [[fertilizer]]. It is also an excellent source of [[potassium]] for manufacture of [[potash]] and [[potassium nitrate]]. Also some of microalgae can be used like this. &lt;ref&gt;ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/011/i0424e/i0424e00.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both microalgae and macroalgae are used to make [[agar]].&lt;ref name="SeaweedUses"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Seaweeds and their Uses | journal=Methuen &amp; Co.

===Pollution control===
With concern over [[global warming]], new methods for the thorough and efficient [[Carbon capture and storage|capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] are being sought out. The carbon dioxide that a carbon-fuel burning plant produces can feed into open or closed algae systems, fixing the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and accelerating algae growth. Untreated [[sewage]] can supply additional nutrients, thus turning two pollutants into valuable commodities.&lt;ref name="SmokestackGasTank"&gt;

Algae cultivation is under study for uranium/plutonium sequestration and purifying fertilizer runoff.

===Energy production===
Business, academia and governments are exploring the possibility of using algae to make gasoline, bio-diesel, biogas and other fuels. Algae itself may be used as a biofuel, and additionally be used to create hydrogen. See [[Algae fuel]].

===Other uses===
Chlorella, particularly a transgenic strain which carries an extra mercury [[reductase]] [[gene]], has been studied as an agent for [[environmental remediation]] due to its ability to reduce {{chem|Hg|2+}} to the less toxic elemental mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Huang C |title=Expression of mercuric reductase from Bacillus megaterium MB1 in eukaryotic microalga Chlorella sp.

[[Image:BatTerminal-SideBar.jpg|thumb|right|Common battery contacts and terminals for smaller batteries]]

'''Battery terminals''' are the [[electrical contact]]s used to connect a [[Electrical load|load]] or [[Battery charger|charger]] to a single cell or multiple-cell [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. These terminals have a wide variety of designs, sizes, and features that are often not well documented.

==Automotive battery terminals==
[[Car battery|Automotive batteries]] typically have one of three types of terminals.

In recent years, the most common design was the ''[[SAE International|SAE]] Post'', consisting of two [[lead]] posts in the shape of truncated cones, positioned on the top of the battery, with slightly different diameters to ensure correct [[electrical polarity]].

The "JIS" type is similar to the SAE but smaller, once again positive is larger than negative but both are smaller than their SAE counterparts. Most older Japanese cars were fitted with JIS terminals.

[[General Motors]], and other [[automobile]] manufacturers, have also begun using side-post battery terminals, which consist of two recessed [[Female connector|female]] 3/8" threads (SAE 3/8-16) into which bolts or various battery terminal adapters are to be attached. These side posts are of the same size and do not prevent incorrect polarity connections.

L terminals consist of an L-shaped post with a bolt hole through the vertical side. These are used on some [[Europe]]an [[car]]s, [[motorcycle]]s, lawn and garden devices, [[snowmobile]]s, and other light duty vehicles.

Some batteries sizes are available with terminals in two different configurations: 1) positive on left and negative on right, 2) negative on left and positive on right.  Purchasing the wrong configuration may prevent battery cables from reaching the battery terminals.

==Marine battery terminals==
Marine batteries typically have two posts, a 3/8"-16 threaded post for the [[Positive (electricity)|positive]] terminal, and a 5/16"-18 threaded post for the [[Negative (electricity)|negative]] terminal.{{Citation needed|reason=ABYC may have changed this standard recently|date=October 2016}}

== Zinc battery terminals ==
Zinc battery terminals are an environmentally friendly alternative to lead battery terminals.  These types of battery terminals were designed as a result of environmental directives such as [[Proposition 65]] and [[ROHS]].  Zinc battery terminals offer advantages over lead alloy type battery terminals.  These advantages include increased electrical conductivity, increased corrosion resistance, and reduced lead removal costs. {{cn|date=October 2017}}

==SLA battery terminals==
The most common sizes of [[VRLA battery|sealed lead acid]] (SLA) batteries use [[Faston]] tabs, but some larger batteries use L terminals, while some very specialized designs use other, sometimes proprietary terminals, such as older [[Panasonic]] [[camcorder]] batteries (of the type used for [[VHS]] shoulder-mounted camcorders).

==UPS battery terminals==
Batteries designed for use inside a portable [[uninterruptable power supply]] (UPS) typically use Faston tabs, often with an adapter cable between those and the UPS's internal battery connectors. Larger external battery packs use a variety of connectors, including the [[Anderson Powerpole]] MultiPole series (as used by [[Tripp Lite]]), which are color-coded and keyed for specific [[voltage]]s. Very large batteries as installed in [[battery room]]s such as are found in datacenters use bolted connections from cell terminals to bus bars or flexible cables.

==Dry battery terminals==
Most cylindrical [[Dry battery|dry batteries]] (such as the [[AA battery]]) have a projection at one end (positive) and a flat base (negative).  These mate with metal strips or springs in the [[battery holder]].

Six volt [[Lantern battery|lantern batteries]] typically feature two coiled, cone-shaped spring terminals, designed to mate with flat contact plates on the inside of the battery compartment.  Some lantern batteries instead feature screw terminals, while still others instead feature pin holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evergreencpusa.com/battery/lantern.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818170601/http://evergreencpusa.com/battery/lantern.htm |archivedate=2007-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nine-volt battery|Nine-volt batteries]] have snap-on connectors.

[[Button cell]] (watch batteries) have terminals as both flat sides.

In [[biochemistry]] and [[metabolism]], '''beta-oxidation''' is the [[catabolism|catabolic process]] by which [[fatty acid]] molecules are broken down&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Houten SM, Wanders RJ | title = A general introduction to the biochemistry of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation | journal = Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 469–77 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20195903 | pmc = 2950079 | doi = 10.1007/s10545-010-9061-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the cytosol in prokaryotes and in the [[mitochondria]] in eukaryotes to generate [[acetyl-CoA]], which enters the [[citric acid cycle]], and [[NADH]] and [[FADH2|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], which are co-enzymes used in the [[electron transport chain]]. It is named as such because the [[alpha and beta carbon|beta carbon]] of the fatty acid undergoes oxidation to a [[carbonyl]] group. Beta-oxidation is primarily facilitated by the [[mitochondrial trifunctional protein]], an enzyme complex associated with the [[inner mitochondrial membrane]], although [[very long chain fatty acid]]s are oxidized in [[peroxisome]]s.

The overall reaction for one cycle of beta oxidation is:

:C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-acyl-CoA  +  FAD + {{chem|NAD|+}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} + CoA → C&lt;sub&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sub&gt;-acyl-CoA + {{chem|FADH|2}} + NADH + {{chem|H|+}} + acetyl-CoA

==Overview==
Fatty acid catabolism consists of:
#Activation and membrane transport of free fatty acids by binding to [[coenzyme A]].
#Oxidation of the beta carbon to a carbonyl group.
#Cleavage of two-carbon segments resulting in [[acetyl-CoA]].
#Oxidation of [[acetyl-CoA]] to [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[citric acid cycle]].
#Electron transfer from electron carriers to the [[electron transport chain]] in [[oxidative phosphorylation]].

==Activation and membrane transport==
[[File:Metabolism1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A diagrammatic illustration of the process of lipolysis (in a fat cell) induced by high [[epinephrine]] and low [[insulin]] levels in the blood. Epinephrine binds to a [[Adrenergic receptor#β receptors|beta-adrenergic]] receptor in the cell wall of the adipocyte, which causes [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] to be generated inside the cell. The cAMP activates a [[protein kinase]], which phosphorylates and thus, in turn, activates a [[hormone-sensitive lipase]] in the fat cell. This lipase cleaves free fatty acids from their attachment to glycerol in the fat stored in the fat droplet of the adipocyte. The free fatty acids and glycerol are then released into the blood.]]

The illustrated acyl chain is, for diagrammatic purposes, only 12 carbon atoms long. Most fatty acids in human plasma are 16 or 18 carbon atoms long. CAT is inhibited by high concentrations of [[malonyl-CoA]] (the first committed step in [[fatty acid synthesis]]) in the cytoplasm. This means that fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid catabolism cannot occur simultaneously in any given cell.]]

During this process an acyl-CoA molecule which is 2 carbons shorter than it was at the beginning of the process is formed. Acetyl-CoA, water and 5 [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] molecules are the other products of each beta-oxidative event, until the entire acyl-CoA molecule has been reduced to a set of [[acetyl-CoA]] molecules.]]

Free fatty acids cannot penetrate any biological membrane due to their negative charge. Free fatty acids must cross the cell membrane through specific [[transport proteins]], such as the [[Solute carrier family|SLC27]] family fatty acid transport protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stahl A | title = A current review of fatty acid transport proteins (SLC27) | journal = Pflügers Archiv | volume = 447 | issue = 5 | pages = 722–7 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 12856180 | doi = 10.1007/s00424-003-1106-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson CM, Stahl A | title = SLC27 fatty acid transport proteins | journal = Molecular Aspects of Medicine | volume = 34 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 516–28 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23506886 | pmc = 3602789 | doi = 10.1016/j.mam.2012.07.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in the [[cytosol]], the following processes bring fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix so that beta-oxidation can take place.
#[[Long-chain-fatty-acid—CoA ligase]] catalyzes the reaction between a fatty acid with [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to give a fatty acyl adenylate, plus inorganic pyrophosphate, which then reacts with free [[coenzyme A]] to give a fatty acyl-CoA ester and [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]].
#If the fatty acyl-CoA has a long chain, then the [[Carnitine#Carnitine shuttle: Activation and transportation of fatty acids into the mitochondria|carnitine shuttle]] must be utilized:
##Acyl-CoA is transferred to the hydroxyl group of carnitine by [[carnitine palmitoyltransferase I]], located on the cytosolic faces of the [[outer mitochondrial membrane|outer]] and [[inner mitochondrial membrane]]s.
##Acyl-carnitine is shuttled inside by a [[carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase]], as a carnitine is shuttled outside.
##Acyl-carnitine is converted back to acyl-CoA by [[carnitine palmitoyltransferase II]], located on the interior face of the [[inner mitochondrial membrane]]. The liberated carnitine is shuttled back to the cytosol, as an acyl-carnitine is shuttled into the matrix.
#If the fatty acyl-CoA contains a short chain, these [[short-chain fatty acid]]s can simply diffuse through the inner mitochondrial membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Charney AN, Micic L, Egnor RW | title = Nonionic diffusion of short-chain fatty acids across rat colon | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 274 | issue = 3 Pt 1 | pages = G518–24 | date = March 1998 | pmid = 9530153 | url = http://ajpgi.physiology.org/content/274/3/G518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General mechanism==

Once the fatty acid is inside the [[mitochondrial matrix]], beta-oxidation occurs by cleaving two carbons every cycle to form acetyl-CoA. The process consists of 4 steps.

#A long-chain fatty acid is [[dehydrogenation|dehydrogenated]] to create a trans [[double bond]] between C2 and C3. This is catalyzed by [[acyl CoA dehydrogenase]] to produce trans-delta 2-enoyl CoA. It uses FAD as an electron acceptor and it is reduced to FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  
#Trans-delta2-enoyl CoA is hydrated at the double bond to produce L-3-hydroxyacyl CoA by [[enoyl-CoA hydratase]]. 
#L-3-hydroxyacyl CoA is dehydrogenated again to create 3-ketoacyl CoA by 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase. This enzyme uses NAD as an electron acceptor. 
#[[Thiolysis]] occurs between C2 and C3 (alpha and beta carbons) of 3-ketoacyl CoA. Thiolase enzyme catalyzes the reaction when a new molecule of coenzyme A breaks the bond by nucleophilic attack on C3. This releases the first two carbon units, as acetyl CoA, and a fatty acyl CoA minus two carbons. The process continues until all of the carbons in the fatty acid are turned into acetyl CoA.

Fatty acids are oxidized by most of the tissues in the body. However, some tissues such as the [[Erythrocytes|red blood cells]] of mammals (which do not contain mitochondria),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stier A, Bize P, Schull Q, Zoll J, Singh F, Geny B, Gros F, Royer C, Massemin S, Criscuolo F | title = Avian erythrocytes have functional mitochondria, opening novel perspectives for birds as animal models in the study of ageing | journal = Frontiers in Zoology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 33 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23758841 | pmc = 3686644 | doi = 10.1186/1742-9994-10-33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and cells of the [[central nervous system]] do not use fatty acids for their energy requirements,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schönfeld P, Reiser G | title = Why does brain metabolism not favor burning of fatty acids to provide energy? Reflections on disadvantages of the use of free fatty acids as fuel for brain | journal = Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism | volume = 33 | issue = 10 | pages = 1493–9 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23921897 | pmc = 3790936 | doi = 10.1038/jcbfm.2013.128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but instead use carbohydrates (red blood cells and neurons) or [[ketone bodies]] (neurons only).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoshida T, Shevkoplyas SS | title = Anaerobic storage of red blood cells | journal = Blood Transfusion = Trasfusione del Sangue | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 220–36 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20967163 | pmc = 2957487 | doi = 10.2450/2010.0022-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Because many fatty acids are not fully saturated or do not have an even number of carbons, several different mechanisms have evolved, described below.
{{-}}
==Even-numbered saturated fatty acids==
Once inside the mitochondria, each cycle of β-oxidation, liberating a two carbon unit ([[acetyl-CoA]]), occurs in a sequence of four reactions:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Description''' || '''Diagram''' || '''Enzyme''' || '''End product'''
 |- 
 | ''[[Dehydrogenation]] by [[flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]]:'' The first step is the oxidation of the fatty acid by Acyl-CoA-Dehydrogenase. The enzyme catalyzes the formation of a [[double bond]] between the C-2 and C-3.  || [[Image:Beta-Oxidation1.svg|center|400px]] || [[acyl CoA dehydrogenase]] || trans-Δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-enoyl-CoA
 |- 
 | ''Hydration:'' The next step is the [[hydration reaction|hydration]] of the bond between C-2 and C-3. The reaction is [[stereospecific]], forming only the L [[isomer]]. || [[Image:Beta-Oxidation2.svg|center|400px]] ||  [[enoyl CoA hydratase]]  || L-β-hydroxyacyl CoA
 |- 
 | ''[[Oxidation]] by [[NADH|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]:'' The third step is the [[oxidation]] of L-β-hydroxyacyl CoA by NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. This converts the [[hydroxyl]] group into a [[ketone|keto]] group. || [[Image:Beta-Oxidation3.svg|center|400px]] || [[3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase]]  || β-ketoacyl CoA
 |- 
 | ''[[Thiolysis]]:'' The final step is the cleavage of β-ketoacyl CoA by the [[thiol]] group of another molecule of [[Coenzyme A]]. The thiol is inserted between C-2 and C-3. || [[Image:Beta-Oxidation4.svg|center|400px]] || [[β-ketothiolase]]  || An [[acetyl-CoA]] molecule, and an [[acyl-CoA]] molecule that is two carbons shorter 
|}

This process continues until the entire chain is cleaved into acetyl CoA units. The final cycle produces two separate acetyl CoAs, instead of one acyl CoA and one acetyl CoA.  For every cycle, the Acyl CoA unit is shortened by two carbon atoms. Concomitantly, one molecule of FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NADH and acetyl CoA are formed.

==Odd-numbered saturated fatty acids==
In general, fatty acids with an odd number of carbons are found in the lipids of plants and some marine organisms. Many ruminant animals form a large amount of 3-carbon propionate during the fermentation of carbohydrates in the rumen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Nelson DL, Cox MM | date = 2005 | title = Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry | edition = 4th | location = New York | publisher = W. H. Freeman and Company | pages = 648–649 | isbn =  978-0-7167-4339-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-chain fatty acids with an odd number of carbon atoms are found particularly in ruminant fat and milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry | publisher = McGraw-Hill Publishing Company | first = Victor W. | last = Rodwell | name-list-format = vanc | edition = 31st }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chains with an odd-number of [[carbon]]s are oxidized in the same manner as even-numbered chains, but the final products are [[propionyl-CoA]] and Acetyl CoA

Propionyl-CoA is first carboxylated using a [[bicarbonate]] [[ion]] into D-stereoisomer of methylmalonyl-CoA, in a reaction that involves a [[biotin]] [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|co-factor]], ATP, and the enzyme [[propionyl-CoA carboxylase]]. The bicarbonate ion's carbon is added to the middle carbon of propionyl-CoA, forming a D-methylmalonyl-CoA. However, the D conformation is enzymatically converted into the L conformation by [[methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase]], then it undergoes intramolecular rearrangement, which is catalyzed by [[methylmalonyl-CoA mutase]] (requiring B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; as a coenzyme) to form succinyl-CoA. The [[succinyl-CoA]] formed can then enter the [[citric acid cycle]].

However, whereas acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle by condensing with an existing molecule of oxaloacetate, succinyl-CoA enters the cycle as a principal in its own right. Thus the succinate just adds to the population of circulating molecules in the cycle and undergoes no net metabolization while in it. When this infusion of citric acid cycle intermediates exceeds [[cataplerosis|cataplerotic]] demand (such as for [[aspartate]] or [[glutamate]] synthesis), some of them can be extracted to the [[gluconeogenesis]] pathway, in the liver and kidneys, through [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase]], and converted to free glucose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=King|first=Michael | name-list-format = vanc |title=Gluconeogenesis: Synthesis of New Glucose |url=http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/gluconeogenesis.php |work=Subsection: "Propionate" |publisher=themedicalbiochemistrypage.org, LLC |access-date=20 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unsaturated fatty acids==
β-Oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids poses a problem since the location of a cis bond can prevent the formation of a trans-Δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bond. These situations are handled by an additional two enzymes, [[Enoyl CoA isomerase]] or [[2,4 Dienoyl CoA reductase]].
[[File:Linoleic acid beta oxidation.svg|alt=|thumb|Complete beta oxidation of [[linoleic acid]] (an unsaturated fatty acid).]]
Whatever the conformation of the hydrocarbon chain, β-oxidation occurs normally until the acyl CoA (because of the presence of a double bond) is not an appropriate substrate for [[acyl CoA dehydrogenase]], or [[enoyl CoA hydratase]]:

*If the acyl CoA contains a ''cis-Δ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bond'', then ''cis-Δ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''-[[Enoyl CoA isomerase]] will convert the bond to a ''trans-Δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' bond, which is a regular substrate.
*If the acyl CoA contains a ''cis-Δ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; double bond'', then its dehydrogenation yields a 2,4-dienoyl intermediate, which is not a substrate for enoyl CoA hydratase. However, the enzyme [[2,4 Dienoyl CoA reductase]] reduces the intermediate, using NADPH, into ''trans-Δ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''-enoyl CoA. As in the above case, this compound is converted into a suitable intermediate by 3,2-Enoyl CoA isomerase.

To summarize:
*''Odd-numbered'' double bonds are handled by the isomerase.
*''Even-numbered'' double bonds by the reductase (which creates an odd-numbered double bond)

==Peroxisomal beta-oxidation==
Fatty acid oxidation also occurs in [[peroxisome]]s when the fatty acid chains are too long to be handled by the mitochondria. The same enzymes are used in peroxisomes as in the mitochondrial matrix, and acetyl-CoA is generated. It is believed that very long chain (greater than C-22) fatty acids, branched fatty acids,&lt;ref name="pmid9059978"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh I | title = Biochemistry of peroxisomes in health and disease | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 167 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 1–29 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9059978 | doi = 10.1023/A:1006883229684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some [[prostaglandin]]s and [[leukotriene]]s&lt;ref name="GibsonLake2013"&gt;{{cite book| first1 = G. Gordon | last1 = Gibson | first2 = Brian G. | last2 = Lake | name-list-format = vanc |title=Peroxisomes: Biology and Importance in Toxicology and Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YwEMQLzH-bYC&amp;pg=PA69|date=2013-04-08|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-48151-6|pages=69–}}&lt;/ref&gt; undergo initial oxidation in peroxisomes until [[octanoyl-CoA]] is formed, at which point it undergoes mitochondrial oxidation.&lt;ref name="pmid627552"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lazarow PB | title = Rat liver peroxisomes catalyze the beta oxidation of fatty acids | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 253 | issue = 5 | pages = 1522–8 | date = March 1978 | pmid = 627552 | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/253/5/1522.short }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One significant difference is that oxidation in peroxisomes is not coupled to [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] synthesis. Instead, the high-potential electrons are transferred to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which yields H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It does generate heat however. The enzyme [[catalase]], found exclusively in peroxisomes, converts the [[hydrogen peroxide]] into [[water]] and [[oxygen]].

Peroxisomal β-oxidation also requires enzymes specific to the peroxisome and to very long fatty acids. There are three key differences between the enzymes used for mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation:
#The NADH formed in the third oxidative step cannot be reoxidized in the peroxisome, so reducing equivalents are exported to the cytosol. 
#β-oxidation in the peroxisome requires the use of a peroxisomal [[carnitine acyltransferase]] (instead of carnitine acyltransferase I and II used by the mitochondria) for transport of the activated acyl group into the mitochondria for further breakdown.
#The first oxidation step in the peroxisome is catalyzed by the enzyme [[acyl-CoA oxidase]].
#The [[β-ketothiolase]] used in peroxisomal β-oxidation has an altered substrate specificity, different from the mitochondrial [[β-ketothiolase]].

Peroxisomal oxidation is induced by a high-fat diet and administration of hypolipidemic drugs like [[clofibrate]].

==Energy yield==
The ATP yield for every oxidation cycle is theoretically a maximum yield of 17, as NADH produces 2.5 ATP, FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produces 1.5 and a full rotation of the citric acid cycle produces 10.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} In practice it is closer to 14 ATP for a full oxidation cycle as the theoretical yield is not attained - it is generally closer to 2.5 ATP per NADH molecule produced, 1.5 for each FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule produced and this equates to 10 per cycle of the TCA {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}(according to the [[P/O ratio]]), broken down as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Source''' || '''ATP''' || '''Total'''
 |- 
 |  1 [[FADH2|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] || x 1.5 ATP  || = 1.5 ATP (Theoretically 2 ATP){{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
 |- 
 |  1 [[NADH]] || x 2.5 ATP  || = 2.5 ATP (Theoretically 3 ATP){{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}
 |- 
 | 1 [[acetyl CoA]] ||  x 10 ATP  || = 10 ATP (Theoretically 12 ATP){{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}
 |- 
 | TOTAL  ||     || = 14 ATP
|}

For an even-numbered saturated fat (C&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;), n - 1 oxidations are necessary, and the final process yields an additional acetyl CoA. In addition, two equivalents of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] are lost during the activation of the fatty acid. Therefore, the total ATP yield can be stated as:

:(n - 1) * 14 + 10 - 2 = total ATP{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}
or
:14n-6 (alternatively)
For instance, the ATP yield of [[palmitate]] (C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n = 8'') is:

:(8 - 1) * 14 + 10 - 2 = 106 ATP{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Represented in table form:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Source''' || '''ATP''' || '''Total'''
 |- 
 |  7 FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || x 1.5 ATP  || = 10.5 ATP
 |- 
 |  7 NADH || x 2.5 ATP  || = 17.5 ATP
 |- 
 | 8 acetyl CoA ||  x 10 ATP  || = 80 ATP
 |- 
 | Activation ||     || = -2 ATP
 |- 
 | NET  ||     || = 106 ATP
|}{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

For sources that use the larger ATP production numbers described above, the total would be 129 ATP ={(8-1)*17+12-2} equivalents per palmitate.

Beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids changes the ATP yield due to the requirement of two possible additional enzymes.

==Similarities between beta-oxidation and citric acid cycle==
The reactions of beta oxidation and part of citric acid cycle present structural similarities in three of four reactions of the beta oxidation: the oxidation by FAD, the hydration, and the oxidation by NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Each enzyme of these metabolic pathways presents structural similarity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Clinical significance==
There are at least 25 enzymes and specific transport proteins in the β-oxidation pathway.&lt;ref name=Tein2013&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Tein I | title = Disorders of fatty acid oxidation | journal = Handbook of Clinical Neurology | volume = 113 | pages = 1675–88 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23622388 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-444-59565-2.00035-6 | isbn = 9780444595652 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 18 have been associated with human disease as [[inborn error of metabolism|inborn errors of metabolism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6855">'''Candoluminescence''' is the [[light]] given off by certain materials at elevated temperatures (usually when exposed to a [[flame]]) that has an intensity at some wavelengths which can be higher than the [[blackbody]] emission expected from [[incandescence]] at the same temperature.&lt;ref name="Ivey"&gt;H.F. Ivey, "Candoluminescence and radical-excited luminescence," ''Journal of Luminescence'' 8:4, pp. 271–307 (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon is notable in certain [[transition-metal]] and [[rare-earth]] oxide materials ([[ceramic]]s) such as [[zinc oxide]], [[cerium(IV) oxide]] and [[thorium dioxide]].

==History==
The existence of the candoluminescence phenomenon and the underlying mechanism have been the subject of extensive research and debate since the first reports of it in the 1800s. The topic was of particular interest before the introduction of electric lighting, when most artificial light was produced by fuel combustion. The main alternative explanation for candoluminescence is that it is simply "selective" thermal emission in which the material has a very high emissivity in the visible spectrum and a very weak emissivity in the part of the spectrum where the blackbody thermal emission would be highest; in such a system, the emitting material will tend to retain a higher temperature because of the lack of invisible radiative cooling. In this scenario, observations of candoluminescence would simply have been underestimating the temperature of the emitting species. Several authors in the 1950s came to the view that candoluminescence was simply an instance of selective thermal emission, and one of the most prominent researchers in the field, V. A. Sokolov, once advocated eliminating the term from the literature in his noted 1952 review article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to revise his view several years later.&lt;ref name="Ivey" /&gt; The modern scientific consensus is that candoluminescence does occur, that it is not always simply due to selective thermal emission, but the mechanisms vary depending on the materials involved and the method of heating, particularly the type of flame and the position of the material relative to the flame.&lt;ref name="Ivey" /&gt;

==Mechanism==

When the fuel in a flame combusts, the energy released by the combustion process is deposited in combustion products, usually molecular fragments called [[free radicals]]. The combustion products are excited to a very high temperature called the [[adiabatic flame temperature]] (that is, the temperature before any heat has been transferred away from the combustion products). This temperature is usually much higher than the temperature of the air in the flame or which an object inserted into the flame can reach. When the combustion products lose this energy by radiative emission, the radiation can thus be more intense than that of a lower-temperature blackbody inserted into the flame. The exact emission process involved varies with the material, the type of fuels and oxidizers, and the type of flame, though in many cases it is well established that the free radicals undergo [[radiative recombination]].&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;D. M. Mason, [http://web.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/11_2_MIAMI2_04-67_0540.pdf "Candoluminescence"] in ''Proc. Am. Chem. Soc., Div. Fuel Chem.'', V. 11:2, pp. 540–554, (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; This energetic light emitted directly from the combustion products may be observed directly (as with a blue gas flame), depending on the wavelength, or it may then cause [[fluorescence]] in the candoluminescent material. Some free-radical recombinations emit [[ultraviolet]] light, which is only observable through fluorescence. 

One important candoluminescence mechanism is that the candoluminescent material [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the recombination, enhancing the intensity of the emission.&lt;ref name="Ivey" /&gt; Extremely narrow-wavelength emission by the combustion products is often an important feature in this process, because it reduces the rate at which the free radicals lose heat to radiation at invisible or non-fluorescence-exciting wavelengths. In other cases, the excited combustion products are thought to directly transfer their energy to luminescent species in the solid material. In any case, the key feature of candoluminescence is that the combustion products lose their energy to radiation without becoming [[Thermalisation|thermalized]] with the environment, which allows the effective temperature of their radiation to be much higher than that of thermal emission from materials in [[thermal equilibrium]] with the environment.

== Welsbach lights ==
Early in the 20th century, there was vigorous debate over whether candoluminescence is required to explain the behavior of Welsbach [[gas mantle]]s or [[limelight]]. One counterargument was that since thorium oxide (for example) has much lower emissivity in the near infrared region than the shorter wavelength parts of the visible spectrum, it should not be strongly cooled by infrared radiation, and thus a thorium-oxide mantle can get closer to the flame temperature than can a blackbody material. The higher temperature would then lead to higher emission levels in the visible portion of the spectrum, without invoking candoluminescence as an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Another argument was that the oxides in the mantle might be actively absorbing the combustion products and thus being selectively raised to combustion-product temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Comment by [[Charles Proteus Steinmetz|C.

{{Classical mechanics}}
In [[Newtonian mechanics]], the '''centrifugal force''' is an [[inertial force]] (also called a "fictitious" or "pseudo" force) directed away from the axis of rotation that appears to act on all objects when viewed in a rotating [[frame of reference]].

The concept of centrifugal force can be applied in rotating devices, such as [[centrifuge]]s, [[centrifugal pump]]s, [[centrifugal governor]]s, and [[centrifugal clutch]]es, and in [[centrifugal railway]]s, [[planetary orbit]]s and [[banked curve]]s, when they are analyzed in a [[rotating coordinate system]]. The term has sometimes also been used for the [[reactive centrifugal force]] that is a reaction to a [[centripetal force]].

==Introduction==
Centrifugal force is an outward force apparent in a [[rotating reference frame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard T. Weidner and Robert L.

All measurements of position and velocity must be made relative to some frame of reference. For example, an analysis of the motion of an object in an airliner in flight could be made relative to the airliner, to the surface of the Earth, or even to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Sframes1.htm|title=Frames of Reference: The Basics|year=2006|publisher=Goddard Space Flight Center Space Physics Data Facility|access-date=20 April 2017|author=David P. Stern|work=From Stargazers to Starships}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A reference frame that is at rest (or one that moves with no rotation and at constant velocity) relative to the "[[fixed stars]]" is generally taken to be an inertial frame. Any system can be analyzed in an inertial frame (and so with no centrifugal force).  However, it is often more convenient to describe a rotating system by using a rotating frame—the calculations are simpler, and descriptions more intuitive.  When this choice is made, fictitious forces, including the centrifugal force, arise.&lt;!-- should we mention [[History of centrifugal and centripetal forces]] here? --&gt;

In a rotating reference frame, all objects, regardless of their state of motion, appear to be under the influence of a radially (from the axis of rotation) outward force that is proportional to their mass, to the distance from the axis of rotation of the frame, and to the square of the [[angular velocity]] of the frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/102850/centrifuge|work = Encyclopædia Britannica|title = Centrifuge|date = April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Feynman Lectures on Physics'', Book 1, 12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the centrifugal force. As humans usually experience centrifugal force from within the rotating reference frame, e.g. on a merry-go-round or vehicle, this is much more well-known than centripetal force.

Motion relative to a rotating frame results in another fictitious force: the [[Coriolis force]]. If the rate of rotation of the frame changes, a third fictitious force (the [[Euler force]]) is required. These fictitious forces are necessary for the formulation of correct equations of motion in a rotating reference frame&lt;ref name=Fetter/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marsden&gt;{{cite book

==Examples==
=== Vehicle driving round a curve ===
A common experience that gives rise to the idea of a centrifugal force is encountered by passengers riding in a vehicle, such as a car, that is changing direction. If a car is traveling at a constant speed along a straight road, then a passenger inside is not accelerating and, according to [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]], the net force acting on him is therefore zero (all forces acting on him cancel each other out). If the car enters a curve that bends to the left, the passenger experiences an apparent force that seems to be pulling him towards the right. This is the fictitious centrifugal force. It is needed within the passenger's local frame of reference to explain his sudden tendency to start accelerating to the right relative to the car—a tendency which he must resist by applying a rightward force to the car (for instance, a frictional force against the seat) in order to remain in a fixed position inside. Since he pushes the seat toward the right, Newton's third law says that the seat pushes him toward the left. The centrifugal force must be included in the passenger's reference frame (in which the passenger remains at rest): it counteracts the leftward force applied to the passenger by the seat, and explains why this otherwise unbalanced force does not cause him to accelerate.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/centrifugal-force |title=Centrifugal force |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=17 August 2016 |access-date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it would be apparent to a stationary observer watching from an overpass above that the frictional force exerted on the passenger by the seat is not being balanced; it constitutes a net force to the left, causing the passenger to accelerate toward the inside of the curve, as he must in order to keep moving with the car rather than proceeding in a straight line as he otherwise would. Thus the "centrifugal force" he feels is the result of a "centrifugal tendency" caused by inertia.&lt;ref name="Science of Everyday Things"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/ScienceOfEverydayThingsVol2-RealLifePhysics/ScienceOfEverydayThingsVol.2-Physics365s-o#page/n49/mode/2up/search/Centrifugal+force|title=Centripetal Force |work=Science of Everyday Things, Volume 2: Real-Life Physics |page=47 |editor-first=Neil |editor-last=Schlager |author-first=Judson |author-last=Knight |year=2016 |publisher=Thomson Learning |access-date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar effects are encountered in aeroplanes and [[roller coaster]]s where the magnitude of the apparent force is often reported in "[[g-force|G's]]".

===Stone on a string===
If a stone is whirled round on a string, in a horizontal plane, the only real force acting on the stone in the horizontal plane is applied by the string (gravity acts vertically). There is a net force on the stone in the horizontal plane which acts toward the center.

In an [[inertial frame of reference]], were it not for this net force acting on the stone, the stone would travel in a straight line, according to [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's first law of motion]]. In order to keep the stone moving in a circular path, a [[centripetal force]], in this case provided by the string, must be continuously applied to the stone. As soon as it is removed (for example if the string breaks) the stone moves in a straight line. In this inertial frame, the concept of centrifugal force is not required as all motion can be properly described using only real forces and Newton's laws of motion.

In a frame of reference rotating with the stone around the same axis as the stone, the stone is stationary. However, the force applied by the string is still acting on the stone. If one were to apply Newton's laws in their usual (inertial frame) form, one would conclude that the stone should accelerate in the direction of the net applied force—towards the axis of rotation—which it does not do. The centrifugal force and other fictitious forces must be included along with the real forces in order to apply Newton's laws of motion in the rotating frame.

===Earth===
The Earth constitutes a rotating reference frame because it rotates once a day on its axis.  Because the rotation is slow, the fictitious forces it produces are small, and in everyday situations can generally be neglected.  Even in calculations requiring high precision, the centrifugal force is generally not explicitly included, but rather lumped in with the [[gravitational force]]: the strength and direction of the local "[[Gravity of Earth|gravity]]" at any point on the Earth's surface is actually a combination of gravitational and centrifugal forces.

====Weight of an object at the poles and on the equator====
If an object is weighed with a simple [[spring balance]] at one of the Earth's poles, there are two forces acting on the object: the Earth's gravity, which acts in a downward direction, and the equal and opposite [[restoring force]] in the spring, acting upward. Since the object is stationary and not accelerating, there is no net force acting on the object and the force from the spring is equal in magnitude to the force of gravity on the object. In this case, the balance shows the value of the force of gravity on the object.

When the same object is weighed on the [[equator]], the same two real forces act upon the object. However, the object is moving in a circular path as the Earth rotates and therefore experiencing a centripetal acceleration. When considered in an inertial frame (that is to say, one that is not rotating with the Earth), the non-zero acceleration means that force of gravity will not balance with the force from the spring. In order to have a net centripetal force, the magnitude of the restoring force of the spring must be less than the magnitude of force of gravity. Less restoring force in the spring is reflected on the scale as less weight — about 0.3% less at the equator than at the poles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=310 "Curious About Astronomy?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117191330/http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=310 |date=January 17, 2015 }}, Cornell University, retrieved June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Earth reference frame (in which the object being weighed is at rest), the object does not appear to be accelerating, however the two real forces, gravity and the force from the spring, are the same magnitude and do not balance. The centrifugal force must be included to make the sum of the forces be zero to match the apparent lack of acceleration.

&lt;small&gt;
'''Note:''' ''In fact, the observed weight difference is more — about 0.53%. Earth's gravity is a bit stronger at the poles than at the equator, because the Earth is [[Oblate spheroid|not a perfect sphere]], so an object at the poles is slightly closer to the center of the Earth than one at the equator; this effect combines with the centrifugal force to produce the observed weight difference.''&lt;ref name="Boynton"&gt;{{cite conference

&lt;/small&gt;

====Equatorial railway====
This [[Gedanken|thought experiment]] is more complicated than the previous examples in that it requires the use of the [[Coriolis force]] as well as the centrifugal force.

If there were a railway line running round the Earth's equator, a train moving westward along it fast enough would remain stationary in a frame moving (but not rotating) with the Earth; it would stand still as the Earth spun beneath it. In this inertial frame the situation is easy to analyze. The only forces acting on the train (assuming no wind resistance or other horizontal forces) are its gravity (downward) and the equal and opposite (upward) force from the track. There is no net force on the train and it therefore remains stationary.

In a frame rotating with the Earth the train moves in a circular orbit as it travels round the Earth. In this frame, the upward reaction force from the track and the force of gravity on the train remain the same, as they are real forces. However, in the Earth's (rotating) frame, the train is traveling in a circular path and therefore requires a centripetal (downward) force to keep it on this path. Because this uses a rotating frame, the (fictitious) centrifugal force must be applied to the train. This is equal in value to the required centripetal force but acts in an upward direction — the opposite direction to that required. It would seem that there is a net upward force on the train and it should therefore accelerate upward.

The resolution to this paradox lies in the fact that the train is in motion with respect to the rotating frame and is subject to (in addition to the centrifugal force) the Coriolis force, which, in this example, acts downward direction and is twice as strong as centrifugal force.

== Derivation ==
{{Main|Rotating reference frame}}
{{See also|Fictitious force|Mechanics of planar particle motion}}

For the following formalism, the [[rotating frame of reference]] is regarded as a special case of a [[non-inertial reference frame]] that is rotating relative to an [[inertial reference frame]] denoted the stationary frame.

=== Time derivatives in a rotating frame ===
In a rotating frame of reference, the time derivatives of any vector function {{math|'''''P'''''}} of time—such as the velocity and acceleration vectors of an object—will differ from its time derivatives in the stationary frame.  If {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the components of {{math|'''''P'''''}} with respect to unit vectors {{math|'''''i''''', '''''j''''', '''''k'''''}} directed along the axes of the rotating frame (i.e. {{math|'''''P''''' {{=}}  ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; '''''i''''' + ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; '''''j''''' +''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; '''''k'''''}}), then the first time derivative {{math|[d'''''P'''''/d''t'']}} of {{math|'''''P'''''}}  with respect to the rotating frame is, by definition, {{math|d''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/d''t'' '''''i''''' + d''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/d''t'' '''''j''''' + d''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/d''t'' '''''k'''''}}.  If the absolute [[angular velocity]]  of the rotating frame is {{math|'''''ω'''''}} then the derivative {{math|d'''''P'''''/d''t''}} of {{math|'''''P'''''}}  with respect to the stationary frame is related to {{math|[d'''''P'''''/d''t'']}}  by the equation:&lt;ref name=Synge&gt;

{{centre|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\operatorname{d}\boldsymbol{P}}{\operatorname{d}t} = \left[\frac{\operatorname{d}\boldsymbol{P}}{\operatorname{d}t}\right] + \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \boldsymbol{P}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;}}

where &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[vector cross product]]. In other words, the rate of change of {{math|'''''P'''''}} in the stationary frame is the sum of its apparent rate of change in the rotating frame and a rate of rotation &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \boldsymbol{P}&lt;/math&gt; attributable to the motion of the rotating frame. The vector {{math|'''''ω'''''}} has magnitude {{math|''ω''}} equal to the rate of rotation and is directed along the axis of rotation according to the [[right-hand rule]].

=== Acceleration ===
Newton's law of motion for a particle of mass ''m'' written in vector form is:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F} = m\boldsymbol{a}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''''F'''''}} is the vector sum of the physical forces applied to the particle and {{math|'''''a'''''}} is the absolute [[acceleration]] (that is, acceleration in an [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frame]]) of the particle, given by:

: &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{a}=\frac{\operatorname{d}^2\boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t^2} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''''r'''''}} is the position vector of the particle.

By applying the transformation above from the stationary to the rotating frame three times (twice to &lt;math&gt;\frac{\operatorname{d}\boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t}&lt;/math&gt; and once to &lt;math&gt; \frac{\operatorname{d}}{\operatorname{d}t}\left[\frac{\operatorname{d}\boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t}\right]&lt;/math&gt;), the absolute acceleration of the particle can be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{a} &amp;=\frac{\operatorname{d}^2\boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t^2} = \frac{\operatorname{d}}{\operatorname{d}t}\frac{\operatorname{d}\boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t} = \frac{\operatorname{d}}{\operatorname{d}t} \left( \left[\frac{\operatorname{d}\boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t}\right] + \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \boldsymbol{r}\ \right) \\
&amp;= \left[ \frac{\operatorname{d}^2 \boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t^2} \right] + \boldsymbol{\omega}\times \left[ \frac{\operatorname{d} \boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t} \right] +  \frac{\operatorname{d} \boldsymbol{\omega}}{\operatorname{d}t}\times\boldsymbol{r} +  \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \frac{\operatorname{d}\boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t} \\
&amp;=  \left[ \frac{\operatorname{d}^2 \boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t^2} \right] + \boldsymbol{\omega}\times \left[ \frac{\operatorname{d} \boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t} \right] +  \frac{\operatorname{d} \boldsymbol{\omega}}{\operatorname{d}t}\times\boldsymbol{r} +  \boldsymbol{\omega} \times
 \left( \left[\frac{\operatorname{d}\boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t}\right] + \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \boldsymbol{r}\ \right) \\
 &amp;= \left[ \frac{\operatorname{d}^2 \boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t^2} \right] + \frac{\operatorname{d} \boldsymbol{\omega}}{\operatorname{d}t}\times\boldsymbol{r} + 2 \boldsymbol{\omega}\times \left[ \frac{\operatorname{d} \boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t} \right] + \boldsymbol{\omega}\times ( \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \boldsymbol{r}) \ .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Force ===
The apparent acceleration in the rotating frame is {{tmath| \left[\frac{d^2\boldsymbol{r} }{dt^2}\right] }}. An observer unaware of the rotation would expect this to be zero in the absence of outside forces. However, Newton's laws of motion apply only in the inertial frame and describe dynamics in terms of the absolute acceleration {{tmath| \frac{d^2\boldsymbol{r} }{dt^2} }}. Therefore, the observer perceives the extra terms as contributions due to fictitious forces. These terms in the apparent acceleration are independent of mass; so it appears that each of these fictitious forces, like gravity, pulls on an object in proportion to its mass. When these forces are added, the equation of motion has the form:&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2005). p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=L&amp;L_A&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, as the centrifugal force is proportional to the distance from object to the axis of rotation of the frame, the centrifugal force vanishes for objects that lie upon the axis.

Three scenarios were suggested by Newton to answer the question of whether the [[absolute rotation]] of a local frame can be detected; that is, if an observer can decide whether an observed object is rotating or if the observer is rotating.&lt;ref&gt;

* The shape of the surface of water [[rotating bucket|rotating in a bucket]]. The shape of the surface becomes concave to balance the centrifugal force against the other forces upon the liquid.
* The tension in a string joining two [[rotating spheres|spheres rotating]] about their center of mass. The tension in the string will be proportional to the centrifugal force on each sphere as it rotates around the common center of mass.

In these scenarios, the effects attributed to centrifugal force are only observed in the local frame (the frame in which the object is stationary) if the object is undergoing absolute rotation relative to an inertial frame. By contrast, in an inertial frame, the observed effects arise as a consequence of the inertia and the known forces without the need to introduce a centrifugal force. Based on this argument, the privileged frame, wherein the laws of physics take on the simplest form, is a stationary frame in which no fictitious forces need to be invoked.

Within this view of physics, any other phenomenon that is usually attributed to centrifugal force can be used to identify absolute rotation. For example, the oblateness of a sphere of freely flowing material is often explained in terms of centrifugal force. The [[oblate spheroid]] shape reflects, following [[Clairaut's theorem]], the balance between containment by gravitational attraction and dispersal by centrifugal force. That the Earth is itself an oblate spheroid, bulging at the equator where the radial distance and hence the centrifugal force is larger, is taken as one of the evidences for its absolute rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Popular astronomy |author=Simon Newcomb |pages=86&amp;ndash;88 |year=1878 |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
The operations of numerous common rotating mechanical systems are most easily conceptualized in terms of centrifugal force. For example:

* A [[centrifugal governor]] regulates the speed of an engine by using spinning masses that move radially, adjusting the [[throttle]], as the engine changes speed. In the reference frame of the spinning masses, centrifugal force causes the radial movement.
* A [[centrifugal clutch]] is used in small engine-powered devices such as chain saws, go-karts and model helicopters. It allows the engine to start and idle without driving the device but automatically and smoothly engages the drive as the engine speed rises. [[Self-locking device#Inertial drum brake ascender|Inertial drum brake ascenders]] used in [[rock climbing]] and the [[seat belt#Technology|inertia reels]] used in many automobile seat belts operate on the same principle.
* Centrifugal forces can be used to generate [[artificial gravity]], as in proposed designs for rotating space stations. The [[Mars Gravity Biosatellite]] would have studied the effects of [[Mars]]-level gravity on mice with gravity simulated in this way.
* [[Spin casting]] and [[centrifugal casting (industrial)|centrifugal casting]] are production methods that uses centrifugal force to disperse liquid metal or plastic throughout the negative space of a mold.
* [[Centrifuge]]s are used in science and industry to separate substances. In the reference frame spinning with the centrifuge, the centrifugal force induces a hydrostatic pressure gradient in fluid-filled tubes oriented perpendicular to the axis of rotation, giving rise to large [[buoyant force]]s which push low-density particles inward. Elements or particles denser than the fluid move outward under the influence of the centrifugal force. This is effectively [[Archimedes' principle]] as generated by centrifugal force as opposed to being generated by gravity.
* Some [[amusement ride]]s make use of centrifugal forces. For instance, a [[Gravitron]]'s spin forces riders against a wall and allows riders to be elevated above the machine's floor in defiance of Earth's gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The basics of physics |first1=Rusty L. |last1=Myers |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-313-32857-2 |page=57 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnynjL44pI4C&amp;pg=PA57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, all of these systems can also be described without requiring the concept of centrifugal force, in terms of motions and forces in a stationary frame, at the cost of taking somewhat more care in the consideration of forces and motions within the system.

==History of conceptions of centrifugal and centripetal forces==
{{Main|History of centrifugal and centripetal forces}}

The conception of centrifugal force has evolved since the time of [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and [[Robert Hooke|Hooke]] who expressed early conceptions of it. Its modern conception as a fictitious force arising in a rotating reference frame evolved in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Centrifugal force has also played a role in debates in [[classical mechanics]] about detection of absolute motion. Newton suggested two arguments to answer the question of whether [[absolute rotation]] can be detected: the rotating [[bucket argument]], and the [[rotating spheres]] argument.&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to Newton, in each scenario the centrifugal force would be observed in the object's local frame (the frame where the object is stationary) only if the frame were rotating with respect to absolute space. Nearly two centuries later, [[Mach's principle]] was proposed where, instead of absolute rotation, the motion of the distant stars relative to the local inertial frame gives rise through some (hypothetical) physical law to the centrifugal force and other inertia effects. Today's view is based upon the idea of an [[inertial frame of reference]], which privileges observers for which the laws of physics take on their simplest form, and in particular, frames that do not use centrifugal forces in their equations of motion in order to describe motions correctly.

The analogy between centrifugal force (sometimes used to create [[artificial gravity]]) and gravitational forces led to the [[equivalence principle]] of [[general relativity]].&lt;ref name=Barbour&gt;Barbour, Julian B. and Herbert Pfister (1995).

==Other uses of the term==
While the majority of the scientific literature uses the term ''centrifugal force'' to refer to the particular fictitious force that arises in rotating frames, there are a few limited instances in the literature of the term applied to other distinct physical concepts. One of these instances occurs in [[Lagrangian mechanics]]. Lagrangian mechanics formulates mechanics in terms of [[generalized coordinates]] {''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}, which can be as simple as the usual polar coordinates &lt;math&gt;(r,\ \theta)&lt;/math&gt; or a much more extensive list of variables.&lt;ref name=Lanczos&gt;For an introduction, see for example {{cite book |isbn=978-0-486-65067-8 |title=The variational principles of mechanics |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;dq=isbn=0-486-65067-7#PPR21,M1 |publisher=Dover |edition=Reprint of 1970 University of Toronto |page=1 |author=Cornelius Lanczos |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shabana1&gt;For a description of generalized coordinates, see {{cite book |author= Ahmed A.

In another instance the term refers to the [[reaction (physics)|reaction]] [[force]] to a [[centripetal force]], or [[reactive centrifugal force]]. A body undergoing curved motion, such as [[circular motion]], is [[accelerate|accelerating]] toward a center at any particular point in time. This [[centripetal acceleration]] is provided by a [[centripetal force]], which is exerted on the body in curved motion by some other body. In accordance with [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|Newton's third law of motion]], the body in curved motion exerts an equal and opposite force on the other body. This [[reaction (physics)|reactive]] force is exerted ''by'' the body in curved motion ''on'' the other body that provides the centripetal force and its direction is from that other body toward the body in curved motion.&lt;ref name=Mook&gt;

{{Infobox chromium}}
'''Chromium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Cr''' and [[atomic number]] 24. It is the first element in [[Group 6 element|group 6]]. It is a steely-grey, [[Luster (mineralogy)|lustrous]], hard and brittle [[transition metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Brandes|first1 = EA|last2 = Greenaway|first2 = HT|last3 = Stone|first3 = HEN|date = 1956|title = Ductility in Chromium|journal = Nature|volume = 178|issue = 4533|doi = 10.1038/178587a0|page = 587|bibcode = 1956Natur.178..587B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium boasts a high usage rate as a [[metal]] that is able to be highly [[polishing|polished]] while resisting [[tarnish]]ing. Chromium is also the main component of [[stainless steel]], a popular steel alloy due to its uncommonly high [[specular reflection]]. Simple polished chromium reflects almost 70% of the [[visible spectrum]], with almost 90% of [[infrared|infrared light]] waves being reflected.&lt;ref name = "NIST specular reflection"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Coblentz|first1 = WW|last2 = Stair|first2 = R|title = Reflecting power of beryllium, chromium, and several other metals|url = https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/2/jresv2n2p343_A2b.pdf|website = National Institute of Standards and Technology|publisher = NIST Publications|accessdate = 11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the element is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word χρῶμα, ''chrōma'', meaning [[color]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dxrw%3Dma χρῶμα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; because many chromium compounds are intensely colored.

[[Ferrochromium]] alloy is commercially produced from [[chromite]] by [[silicothermic]] or [[aluminothermic reaction]]s and chromium metal by [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] and [[Leaching (metallurgy)|leaching]] processes followed by reduction with [[carbon]] and then [[aluminium]]. Chromium metal is of high value for its high [[corrosion]] resistance and [[hardness]]. A major development in steel production was the discovery that steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form [[stainless steel]]. Stainless steel and [[chrome plating]] ([[electroplating]] with chromium) together comprise 85% of the commercial use.

In the United States, [[trivalent]] chromium (Cr(III)) [[ion]] is considered an [[essential nutrient]] in humans for [[insulin]], [[sugar]] and [[lipid]] [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name="ods"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Chromium-HealthProfessional/#h2 | title=Chromium | publisher=Office of Dietary Supplements, US National Institutes of Health | date=2016 | accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2014, the [[European Food Safety Authority]], acting for the European Union, concluded that there was not sufficient evidence for chromium to be recognized as essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/3845|title = Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for chromium|date = 18 September 2014|accessdate = 20 March 2018|publisher = [[European Food Safety Authority]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While chromium metal and Cr(III) ions are not considered toxic, [[hexavalent chromium]] (Cr(VI)) is both toxic and [[carcinogenic]]. Abandoned chromium production sites often require [[Environmental remediation|environmental cleanup]].

== Physical properties ==
=== Atomic ===
Chromium is the fourth [[transition metal]] found on the periodic table, and has an electron configuration of [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[argon|Ar]]] 3d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; 4s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. It is also the first element in the periodic table whose ground-state electron configuration violates the [[Aufbau principle]]. This occurs again later in the periodic table with other elements and their electron configurations, such as [[copper]], [[niobium]], and [[molybdenum]].&lt;ref name = "CasaXPS"&gt;{{cite web|title = The Nature of X-Ray Photoelectron Spectra|website= CasaXPS|publisher = Casa Software Ltd.|date = 2005|accessdate = 4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs because electrons in the same orbital repel each other due to their like charges. In the previous elements, the energetic cost of promoting an electron to the next higher energy level is too great to compensate for that released by lessening inter-electronic repulsion. However, in the 3d transition metals, the energy gap between the 3d and the next-higher 4s subshell is very small, and because the 3d subshell is more compact than the 4s subshell, inter-electron repulsion is smaller between 4s electrons than between 3d electrons. This lowers the energetic cost of promotion and increases the energy released by it, so that the promotion becomes energetically feasible and one or even two electrons are always promoted to the 4s subshell. (Similar promotions happen for every transition metal atom but one, [[palladium]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwarz |first1=W. H. Eugen |date=April 2010 |title=The Full Story of the Electron Configurations of the Transition Elements |url=http://www.quimica.ufpr.br/edulsa/cq115/artigos/The_full_story_of_the_electron_configurations_of_the_transition_elements.pdf |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=444–8 |doi=10.1021/ed8001286 |access-date=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromium is the first element in the 3d series where the 3d electrons are starting to sink into the inert core; they thus contribute less to [[metallic bonding]], and hence the melting and boiling points and the [[enthalpy of atomisation]] of chromium are lower than those of the preceding element [[vanadium]].  Chromium(VI) is a strong [[oxidising agent]] in contrast to the [[molybdenum]](VI) and [[tungsten]](VI) oxides.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1004&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1004–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromium has an unusually high [[specular reflection]] in comparison to that of other transitional metals. At 425 [[micrometer|μm]], chromium was found to have a relative maximum reflection of about 72% reflectance, before entering a depression in reflectivity, reaching a minimum of 62% reflectance at 750 [[micrometer|μm]] before rising again to reflecting roughly 90% of 4000 [[micrometer|μm]] of [[infrared]] [[light|waves]].&lt;ref name = "NIST specular reflection"/&gt;.

=== Bulk ===
[[File:Chromium.jpg|thumb|left|Sample of pure chromium metal]]
&lt;!--- Pure lead has a bright, silvery appearance with a hint of blue. It tarnishes on contact with moist air, and takes on a dull appearance, the hue of which depends on the prevailing conditions. Characteristic properties of lead include high [[density]], malleability, ductility, and high resistance to [[corrosion]] due to [[passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]. ---&gt;
&lt;!--- Lead's close-packed face-centered cubic structure and high atomic weight result in a density of 11.34&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is greater than that of common metals such as [[iron]] (7.87&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), [[copper]] (8.93&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and [[zinc]] (7.14&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Some rarer metals are denser: [[tungsten]] and [[gold]] are both at 19.3&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[osmium]]—the densest metal known—has a density of 22.59&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, almost twice that of lead. ---&gt;
&lt;!--- Lead is a very soft metal with a [[Mohs hardness]] of 1.5; it can be scratched with a fingernail. It is quite malleable and somewhat ductile. The [[bulk modulus]] of lead—a measure of its ease of compressibility—is 45.8&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|GPa]]. In comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2&amp;nbsp;GPa; copper 137.8&amp;nbsp;GPa; and [[mild steel]] 160–169&amp;nbsp;GPa. Lead's [[tensile strength]], at 12–17 MPa, is low (that of aluminium is 6 times higher, copper 10 times, and mild steel 15 times higher); it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or [[antimony]]. ---&gt;
&lt;!--- The melting point of lead—at 327.5&amp;nbsp;°C (621.5&amp;nbsp;°F)—is very low compared to most metals.{{sfn|Thornton|Rautiu |Brush|2001|p=6}}{{efn|A (wet) finger can be dipped into molten lead without risk of a burning injury.{{sfn|Willey|1999}}}} Its [[boiling point]] of 1749&amp;nbsp;°C (3180&amp;nbsp;°F){{sfn|Lide|2005|p=12-219}} is the lowest among the carbon group elements. The [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical resistivity]] of lead at 20&amp;nbsp;°C is 192 [[ohm|nanoohm]]-[[meter]]s, almost an [[order of magnitude]] higher than those of other industrial metals (copper at 15.43&amp;nbsp;nΩ·m; gold 20.51&amp;nbsp;nΩ·m; and aluminium at 24.15&amp;nbsp;nΩ·m). Lead is a [[superconductor]] at temperatures lower than 7.19&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]; this is the highest [[critical temperature]] of all [[type-I superconductor]]s and the third highest of the elemental superconductors. ---&gt;

==== Passivation ====
Chromium metal left standing in air is [[passivation (chemistry)|passivated]] by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a [[spinel]] structure only a few molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This is different from the oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant [[rust]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The oxidation of alloys|last = Wallwork|first = GR|date = 1976|journal = Reports on Progress in Physics|volume = 39|pages = 401–485|doi = 10.1088/0034-4885/39/5/001|issue = 5|bibcode = 1976RPPh...39..401W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with [[oxidizing acid]]s like [[nitric acid]]. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong [[reducing agent]] that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.&lt;ref name = "HollemanAF"/&gt;

Chromium, unlike such metals as iron and nickel, does not suffer from [[hydrogen embrittlement]]. However, it does suffer from nitrogen [[embrittlement]], reacting with nitrogen from air and forming brittle nitrides at the high temperatures necessary to work the metal parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=CGMrAAAAYAAJ|title = High-temperature oxidation-resistant coatings: coatings for protection from oxidation of superalloys, refractory metals, and graphite|author = National Research Council (U.S.).

=== Isotopes ===
{{Main|Isotopes of chromium}}
Naturally occurring chromium is composed of three stable [[isotope]]s; &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr, &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr and &lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;Cr, with &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr being the most abundant (83.789% [[natural abundance]]). 19 [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized, with the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;Cr with a [[half-life]] of (more than) 1.8{{e|17}} years, and &lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;Cr with a half-life of 27.7 days. All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than 24 hours and the majority less than 1 minute. This element also has 2 [[meta state]]s.&lt;ref name="NUBASE"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Georges|first1 = Audi|last2 = Bersillon|first2 = O|last3 = Blachot|first3 = J| last4 = Wapstra|first4 = AH|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal = Nuclear Physics A|volume = 729|issue = 1|pages = 3–128|date = 2003|doi = 10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|url = http://hal.in2p3.fr/in2p3-00014184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr is the [[radiogenic]] decay product of &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;[[manganese|Mn]] (half-life = 3.74 million years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www-nds.iaea.org/relnsd/vcharthtml/VChartHTML.html|title=Live Chart of Nuclides |last = |first = |date = |website = International Atomic Energy Agency - Nuclear Data Section|access-date = 18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium isotopes are typically collocated (and compounded) with [[manganese]] isotopes.

[[File:Chromium(III)-chloride-purple-anhydrous-sunlight.jpg|thumb|upright|Anhydrous chromium(III) chloride (CrCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]]
A large number of chromium(III) compounds are known, such as [[chromium nitrate|chromium(III) nitrate]], [[chromium(III) acetate]], and [[chromium(III) oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Chromium(III) compounds|url = http://www.npi.gov.au/resource/chromium-iii-compounds|website = National Pollutant Inventory|publisher = Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate =  8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium(III) can be obtained by dissolving elemental chromium in acids like [[hydrochloric acid]] or [[sulfuric acid]], but it can also be formed through the reduction of chromium(VI) by [[cytochrome]] [[cytochrome c|c7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Assfalg|first1 = M|last2 = Banci|first2 = L|last3 = Bertini|first3 = I|last4 = Bruschi|first4 = M|last5 = Michel|first5 = C|last6 = Giudici-Orticoni|first6 = M|last7 = Turano|first7 = P|title = NMR structural characterization of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III) by cytochrome c7|journal = Protein Data Bank|date = 31 July 2002|issue = 1LM2|doi = 10.2210/pdb1LM2/pdb|url = https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1lm2|accessdate = 8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{chem|Cr|3+}} ion has a similar radius (63&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]]) to {{chem|Al|3+}} (radius 50&amp;nbsp;pm), and they can replace each other in some compounds, such as in [[chrome alum]] and [[alum]]. When a trace amount of {{chem|Cr|3+}} replaces {{chem|Al|3+}} in [[corundum]] (aluminium oxide, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pink sapphire]] or red-colored [[ruby]] is formed, depending on the amount of chromium.

Chromium(III) tends to form [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] complexes.  Commercially available [[chromium(III) chloride]] hydrate is the dark green complex [CrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl.  Closely related compounds are the pale green [CrCl(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and violet [Cr(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. If water-free green{{cn|date=November 2018}} [[chromium(III) chloride]] is dissolved in water, the green solution turns violet after some time as the chloride in the inner [[coordination sphere]] is replaced by water. This kind of reaction is also observed with solutions of [[chrome alum]] and other water-soluble chromium(III) salts.

[[Chromium(III) hydroxide]] (Cr(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is [[amphoterism|amphoteric]], dissolving in acidic solutions to form [Cr(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and in basic solutions to form {{chem|[Cr(OH)|6|]|3-}}. It is dehydrated by heating to form the green [[chromium(III) oxide]] (Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), a stable oxide with a crystal structure identical to that of [[corundum]].&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;

==== Chromium(VI) ====
[[Hexavalent chromium|Chromium(VI) compounds]] are oxidants at low or neutral pH. [[chromate and dichromate|Chromate]] anions ({{chem|CrO|4|2-}}) and [[chromate and dichromate|dichromate]] (Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) anions are the principal ions at this oxidation state.  They exist at an equilibrium, determined by pH:
:2 [CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  {{eqm}} [Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Chromium(VI) halides are known also and include the [[hexafluoride]] [[chromium hexafluoride|CrF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[chromyl chloride]] ({{chem|CrO|2|Cl|2}}).&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 1081–1095|isbn = 978-3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|last1 = Holleman|first1 = Arnold F|last2 = Wiber|first2 = Egon|last3 = Wiberg|first3 = Nils|chapter = Chromium|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chrom(VI)-oxid.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Chromium(VI) oxide]]
[[Sodium chromate]] is produced industrially by the oxidative roasting of [[chromite]] ore with [[calcium carbonate|calcium]] or [[sodium carbonate]]. The change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow (chromate) to orange (dichromate), such as when an acid is added to a neutral solution of [[potassium chromate]]. At yet lower pH values, further condensation to more complex [[oxyanion]]s of chromium is possible.

Both the [[chromate and dichromate]] anions are strong oxidizing reagents at low pH:&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;
:{{chem|Cr|2|O|7|2-}} + 14 {{chem|H|3|O|+}} + 6 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2 {{chem|Cr|3+}} + 21 {{chem|H|2|O}} (ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.33&amp;nbsp;V)

They are, however, only moderately oxidizing at high pH:&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;
:{{chem|CrO|4|2-}} + 4 {{chem|H|2|O}} + 3 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → {{chem|Cr(OH)|3}} + 5 {{chem|OH|-}} (ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.13&amp;nbsp;V)

[[File:Chroman sodný.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Sodium chromate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]]
Chromium(VI) compounds in solution can be detected by adding an acidic [[hydrogen peroxide]] solution. The unstable dark blue [[chromium(VI) peroxide]] (CrO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is formed, which can be stabilized as an ether adduct {{chem|CrO|5|·OR|2}}.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;

[[Chromic acid]] has the hypothetical formula {{chem|H|2|CrO|4}}. It is a vaguely described chemical, despite many well-defined chromates and dichromates being known.  The dark red [[chromium(VI) oxide]] {{chem|CrO|3}}, the acid [[anhydride]] of chromic acid, is sold industrially as "chromic acid".&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt; It can be produced by mixing sulfuric acid with dichromate, and is a strong oxidizing agent.

=== Other oxidation states ===
==== Chromium(V) and chromium(IV) ====
The oxidation state +5 is only realized in few compounds but are intermediates in many reactions involving oxidations by chromate. The only binary compound is the volatile [[chromium(V) fluoride]] (CrF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;). This red solid has a melting point of 30&amp;nbsp;°C and a boiling point of 117&amp;nbsp;°C. It can be prepared by treating chromium metal with fluorine at 400&amp;nbsp;°C and 200 bar pressure. The peroxochromate(V) is another example of the +5 oxidation state. [[Potassium tetraperoxochromate(V)|Potassium peroxochromate]] (K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[Cr(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]) is made by reacting potassium chromate with hydrogen peroxide at low temperatures. This red brown compound is stable at room temperature but decomposes spontaneously at 150–170&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://dokumentix.ub.uni-siegen.de/opus/volltexte/2006/52/|title = Preparation, Structure and Vibrational Spectroscopy of Tetraperoxo Complexes of Cr&lt;sup&gt;V+&lt;/sup&gt;, V&lt;sup&gt;V+&lt;/sup&gt;, Nb&lt;sup&gt;V+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ta&lt;sup&gt;V+&lt;/sup&gt;|date= 2003|first = Gentiana|last = Haxhillazi|publisher= PhD thesis, University of Siegen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounds of chromium(IV) (in the +4 oxidation state) are slightly more common than those of chromium(V). The tetrahalides, [[chromium(IV) fluoride|CrF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[chromium(IV) chloride|CrCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], and CrBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, can be produced by treating the trihalides ({{chem|CrX|3}}) with the corresponding halogen at elevated temperatures. Such compounds are susceptible to disproportionation reactions and are not stable in water.

==== Chromium(II) ====
Many chromium(II) compounds are known, such as the water-stable [[chromium(II) chloride]] {{chem|CrCl|2}} that can be made by reducing chromium(III) chloride with zinc. The resulting bright blue solution created from dissolving chromium(II) chloride is only stable at neutral [[pH]].&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt; Some other notable chromium(II) compounds include [[chromium(II) oxide]] {{chem|CrO}}, and [[chromium(II) sulfate]] {{chem|CrSO|4}}. Many chromous carboxylates are known as well, the most famous of these being the red [[chromium(II) acetate]] (Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) that features a quadruple bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotton|first1=FA|authorlink1=F.

==== Chromium(I) ====
Most chromium(I) compounds are obtained solely by oxidation of electron-rich, [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] chromium(0) complexes. Other chromium(I) complexes contain [[cyclopentadienyl]] ligands. As verified by [[X-ray diffraction]], a Cr-Cr [[quintuple bond]] (length 183.51(4) &amp;nbsp;pm) has also been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Nguyen|first1 = T|last2 = Sutton|first2 = AD|last3 = Brynda|first3 = M|last4 = Fettinger|first4 = JC|last5 = Long|first5 = GJ|last6 = Power|first6 = PP|title = Synthesis of a stable compound with fivefold bonding between two chromium(I) centers |journal=Science |volume=310 |issue=5749 |pages=844–847 |date=2005 |pmid = 16179432|doi = 10.1126/science.1116789|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extremely bulky monodentate ligands stabilize this compound by shielding the quintuple bond from further reactions.

== History ==

=== Ancient uses ===
Chromium was first discovered as an element after it came to the attention of the Western world in the red crystalline mineral [[crocoite]] (which is [[lead(II) chromate]]). This mineral was discovered in 1761 and was initially used as a [[pigment]]; the distinctive color was attributed to the chromium from within the crocoite. In present day, nearly all chromium is commercially extracted from the only viable ore for extensiveness and predicted long term use, being [[chromite]], which is iron chromium oxide (FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;); chromite is now the principal source of chromium for use in pigments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Casteran|first1 = Rene|title = Chromite mining|url = https://oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/chromite_mining/#.W7K-TWhKiyJ|website = Oregon Encyclopedia|publisher = Portland State University and the Oregon Historical Society|accessdate = 1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Terracotta Army weapons ====
Weapons found in burial pits dating from the late 3rd century B.C. [[Qin Dynasty]] of the [[Terracotta Army]] near [[Xi'an]], [[China]], have been analyzed by archaeologists. Although these weapons were presumably buried more than two millennia ago, the ancient [[bronze]] tips of both the swords and [[crossbow]] bolts found at the site showed unexpectedly little corrosion, possibly because the bronze was deliberately coated with a thin layer of chromium oxide.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, Maurice. (2004). ''The Terracotta Warriors: The Secret Codes of the Emperor's Army''. Rochester: Bear and Company. {{ISBN|1-59143-033-X}}. Page 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, this oxide layer that was found on the weapons was not pure chromium metal or chrome plating as it is commonly produced today, but a mere 10-15 [[micrometer|μm]] layer of chromium oxide molecules at up to 2% chromium was discovered, which turned out to be enough to protect the bronze from corroding.&lt;ref name="Lorch2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Lorch|first1 = Mark|title = From chrome plating to nanotubes: the 'modern' chemistry first used in ancient times|url = https://theconversation.com/from-chrome-plating-to-nanotubes-the-modern-chemistry-first-used-in-ancient-times-54009|website = The Conversation|publisher = The Conversation US Inc.|accessdate = 19 October 2018|date = 2 Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chromium as pigment ===
Chromium minerals as pigments came to the attention of the west in the 18th century. On 26 July 1761, [[Johann Gottlob Lehmann (scientist)|Johann Gottlob Lehmann]] found an orange-red mineral in the [[Beryozovskoye deposit|Beryozovskoye mines]] in the [[Ural Mountains]] which he named ''Siberian red lead''.&lt;ref name="Meyer 1962 p.

[[File:Cut Ruby.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The red color of rubies is from a trace amount of chromium.]]

In 1794, [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin]] received samples of crocoite [[ore]]. He produced [[chromium(VI) oxide|chromium trioxide]] (CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) by mixing crocoite with [[hydrochloric acid]].&lt;ref name="ChromiumVI"/&gt; In 1797, Vauquelin discovered that he could isolate metallic chromium by heating the oxide in a charcoal oven, for which he is credited as the one who truly discovered the element.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://books.google.com/?id=6dgPAAAAQAAJ|journal =Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts|date = 1798|page = 146–7|volume = 3|title = Memoir on a New Metallic Acid which exists in the Red Lead of Sibiria|first = Louis Nicolas|last = Vauquelin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5gc2AQAAMAAJ|journal = Transactions of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers|year = 1896|page = 482|volume =25|title = Chrome in the Southern Appalachian Region|first = William|last = Glenn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vauquelin was also able to detect traces of chromium in precious [[gemstone]]s, such as [[ruby]] or [[emerald]].&lt;ref name="ChromiumVI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = van der Krogt|first = Peter|title = Chromium|url = http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=Cr|accessdate = 24 Aug 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, chromium was primarily used not only as a component of paints, but in [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] salts as well. For quite some time, the crocoite found in Russia was the main source for such tanning materials. In 1827, a larger chromite deposit was discovered near [[Baltimore]], United States, which quickly met the demand for tanning salts much more adequately than the crocoite that had been used previously. This made the United States the largest producer of chromium products until the year 1848, when larger deposits of chromite were uncovered near the city of [[Bursa]], Turkey.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt;

Chromium is also famous for its reflective, metallic luster when polished. It is used as a protective and decorative coating on car parts, plumbing fixtures, furniture parts and many other items, usually applied by [[electroplating]]. Chromium was used for electroplating as early as 1848, but this use only became widespread with the development of an improved process in 1924.&lt;ref name="Crplating"&gt;{{cite book|title = Nickel and Chromium Plating|publisher = Woodhead Publishing|date = 1993|isbn = 978-1-85573-081-6|pages = 9–12|chapter = History of Chromium Plating|last1 = Dennis|first1 = JK|last2 = Such|first2 = TE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the production of pure chromium, the iron must be separated from the chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated with a mixture of [[calcium carbonate]] and [[sodium carbonate]] in the presence of air. The chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while the iron forms the stable Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the [[chromate]]s and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The chromate is converted by [[sulfuric acid]] into the dichromate.&lt;ref name="IndMin"/&gt;

The strengthening effect of forming stable metal carbides at the grain boundaries and the strong increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The [[high speed steel|high-speed tool steels]] contain between 3 and 5% chromium. [[Stainless steel]], the primary corrosion-resistant metal alloy, is formed when chromium is introduced to [[iron]] in sufficient concentrations, usually where the chromium concentration is above 11%.&lt;ref name="Davis 2000 p.

Also, nickel-based alloys increase in strength due to the formation of discrete, stable metal carbide particles at the grain boundaries. For example, [[Inconel]] 718 contains 18.6% chromium. Because of the excellent high-temperature properties of these nickel [[superalloy]]s, they are used in [[jet engine]]s and [[gas turbine]]s in lieu of common structural materials.&lt;ref name="superal"&gt;{{cite web|title = Nickel-Based Superalloys|first = HK|last = Bhadeshia|url = http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2003/Superalloys/superalloys.html|accessdate = 17 Feb 2009|publisher = University of Cambridge|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060825053006/http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2003/Superalloys/superalloys.html|archivedate = 25 August 2006|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative high hardness and corrosion resistance of unalloyed chromium makes chrome a reliable metal for surface coating; it is still the most popular metal concerning sheet coating with its above average durability compared to other coating metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Breitsameter |first1=M |title=Thermal Spraying versus Hard Chrome Plating |url=https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1576 |website=Azo Materials |publisher=AZoNetwork |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A layer of chromium is deposited on pretreated metallic surfaces by [[electroplating]] techniques. There are two deposition methods: thin and thick. Thin deposition involves a layer of chromium below 1&amp;nbsp;µm thickness deposited by [[chrome plating]], and are used for decorative surfaces. Thicker chromium layers are deposited if wear-resistant surfaces are needed. Both methods use acidic chromate or [[dichromate]] solutions. To prevent the energy-consuming change in oxidation state, the use of chromium(III) sulfate is under development; for most applications of chromium, the previously established process is used.&lt;ref name="Crplating"/&gt;

In the [[chromate conversion coating]] process, the strong oxidative properties of chromates are used to deposit a protective oxide layer on metals like aluminium, zinc and cadmium. This [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] and the self-healing properties by the chromate stored in the chromate conversion coating, which is able to migrate to local defects, are the benefits of this coating method.&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{cite book |last = Edwards |first = J |title = Coating and Surface Treatment Systems for Metals |publisher = Finishing Publications Ltd. and ASMy International |date = 1997|pages = 66–71 |isbn = 978-0-904477-16-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of environmental and health regulations on chromates, alternative coating methods are under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Surface and Coatings Technology |volume=140 |issue=1 |date=2001 |doi=10.1016/S0257-8972(01)01003-9 |title=Effects of chromate and chromate conversion coatings on corrosion of aluminum alloy 2024-T3 |vauthors= Zhao J, Xia L, Sehgal A, Lu D, McCreery RL, Frankel GS  |url=https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/36519/55_FrankelG_EffectsChromateChromateConversion_2001_p51-57.pdf;jsessionid=79F700B63A8774ACE6A18AEFE4D9C4D1?sequence=1 |pages=51–57 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720032734/https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/36519/55_FrankelG_EffectsChromateChromateConversion_2001_p51-57.pdf%3Bjsessionid%3D79F700B63A8774ACE6A18AEFE4D9C4D1?sequence=1 |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy-all |hdl=1811/36519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromic acid [[anodizing]] (or Type I anodizing) of aluminium is another electrochemical process, which does not lead to the deposition of chromium, but uses [[chromic acid]] as electrolyte in the solution. During anodization, an oxide layer is formed on the aluminium. The use of chromic acid, instead of the normally used sulfuric acid, leads to a slight difference of these oxide layers.&lt;ref name="surface"&gt;{{Cite book| title = ASM Handbook: Surface Engineering|last1 = Cotell|first1 = CM|last2=Sprague|first2 = JA|last3 = Smidt|first3 = FA|url = https://books.google.com/?id=RGtsPjqUwy0C&amp;pg=PA484|accessdate = 17 Feb 2009|publisher = ASM International|isbn = 978-0-87170-384-2|date = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The high toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds, used in the established chromium electroplating process, and the strengthening of safety and environmental regulations demand a search for substitutes for chromium or at least a change to less toxic chromium(III) compounds.&lt;ref name="Crplating"/&gt;

The mineral [[crocoite]] (which is also [[lead chromate]] PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) was used as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, [[chrome yellow]] was, together with [[cadmium yellow]], one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the [[United States]] and for the Postal Service (for example, the [[Deutsche Post]]) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow has since declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or other alternatives that are free from lead and chromium. Other pigments that are based around chromium are, for example, the deep shade of red pigment [[chrome red]], which is simply lead chromate with [[lead(II) hydroxide]] (PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·Pb(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pre-treating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of [[polyvinyl butyral]]. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15&amp;nbsp;µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of [[Prussian blue]] and [[chrome yellow]], while the chrome oxide green is [[chromium(III) oxide]].&lt;ref name="Cryel"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=bdQVgKWl3f4C&amp;pg=PA106|title = Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopaedia|first = Rutherford John|last = Gettens|publisher = Courier Dover Publications|date = 1966|isbn = 978-0-486-21597-6|pages = 105–106|chapter =Chrome yellow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Synthetic ruby and the first laser ====
[[File:5 Maiman Laser Components.jpg|thumb|alt=Components of original ruby laser.|Red crystal of an ruby laser]]
Natural [[ruby|rubies]] are [[corundum]] (aluminum oxide) crystals that are colored red (the rarest type) due to chromium (III) ions (other colors of corundum gems are termed [[sapphire]]s). A red-colored artificial ruby may also be achieved by doping chromium(III) into artificial corundum crystals, thus making chromium a requirement for making synthetic rubies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1524/zkri.1964.120.4-5.359|journal = Zeitschrift für Kristallographie|volume = 120|pages = 359–363|date = 1964|title = The chromium position in ruby|first2 = RE|last2 = Newnham|first = SC|last = Moss|url = http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/doclib/zk/vol120/ZK120_359.pdf|issue = 4–5|bibcode = 1964ZK....120..359M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a synthetic ruby crystal was the basis for the first [[laser]], produced in 1960, which relied on [[stimulated emission]] of light from the chromium atoms in such a crystal.

=== Wood preservative ===
Because of their toxicity, chromium(VI) salts are used for the preservation of wood. For example, [[chromated copper arsenate]] (CCA) is used in [[timber treatment]] to protect wood from decay fungi, wood-attacking insects, including [[termites]], and marine borers.&lt;ref name="Hings"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Leaching of chromated copper arsenate wood preservatives: a review|journal = Environmental Pollution|last1 = Hingston|first1 = J|last2 = Collins|first2 = CD|last3 = Murphy|first3 = RJ|last4 = Lester|first4 = JN|volume = 111|issue = 1|pages = 53–66|date = 2001|doi = 10.1016/S0269-7491(00)00030-0 |pmid = 11202715  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The formulations contain chromium based on the oxide CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; between 35.3% and 65.5%. In the United States, 65,300 metric tons of CCA solution were used in 1996.&lt;ref name="Hings"/&gt;

=== Tanning ===
{{Main|Tanning (leather)}}
Chromium(III) salts, especially [[chrome alum]] and [[chromium(III) sulfate]], are used in the tanning of [[leather]]. The chromium(III) stabilizes the leather by cross linking the [[collagen]] fibers.&lt;!-- https://books.google.com/books?id=b1ICltm2IdAC --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Conformational Study of Collagen as Affected by Tanning Procedures|last1 = Brown|first1 = EM|journal = Journal of the American Leather Chemists Association |date = 1997|pages = 225–233|volume = 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium tanned leather can contain between 4 and 5% of chromium, which is tightly bound to the proteins.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; Although the form of chromium used for tanning is not the toxic hexavalent variety, there remains interest in management of chromium in the tanning industry such as recovery and reuse, direct/indirect recycling,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sreeram|first1=K.|title=Sustaining tanning process through conservation, recovery and better utilization of chromium|journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|volume=38|pages=185–212|date=2003|doi=10.1016/S0921-3449(02)00151-9|issue=3|last2=Ramasami|first2=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; use of less chromium or "chrome-less" tanning are practiced to better manage chromium in tanning.

=== Refractory material ===
The high heat resistivity and high melting point makes [[chromite]] and chromium(III) oxide a material for high temperature refractory applications, like [[blast furnace]]s, cement [[kiln]]s, molds for the firing of [[brick]]s and as foundry sands for the [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] of metals. In these applications, the refractory materials are made from mixtures of chromite and magnesite. The use is declining because of the environmental regulations due to the possibility of the formation of chromium(VI).&lt;ref name="IndMin"/&gt; &lt;!--10.1006/rtph.1997.1132 10.1007/BF01285116--&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnhart1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnhart|first1=Joel|title=Occurrences, Uses, and Properties of Chromium|journal=Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology|volume=26|issue=1|year=1997|pages=S3–S7|issn=02732300|doi=10.1006/rtph.1997.1132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catalysts ===
Several chromium compounds are used as [[catalyst]]s for processing hydrocarbons. For example, the [[Phillips catalyst]], prepared from chromium oxides, is used for the production of about half the world's [[polyethylene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Catalysis Today|volume = 51|issue = 2|date=1999|pages=215–221|doi = 10.1016/S0920-5861(99)00046-2|title=Olefin polymerization over supported chromium oxide catalysts|first = Bert M|last = Weckhuysen|last2 = Schoonheydt|first2 = Robert A|url = https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/21357/weckh_99_olefinpolymerization.pdf}}

In the form trivalent chromium, Cr(III), or Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, chromium was tentatively identified as an essential nutrient in the late 1950s and later accepted as a trace element for its roles in the action of [[insulin]], a hormone critical to the metabolism and storage of carbohydrate, fat and protein.&lt;ref name=ods/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Chromium deficiency]], involving a lack of Cr(III) in the body, or perhaps some complex of it, such as [[glucose tolerance factor]] is controversial.&lt;ref name=ods/&gt; Some studies suggest that the biologically active form of chromium (III) is transported in the body via an oligopeptide called [[low-molecular-weight chromium-binding substance]] (LMWCr), which might play a role in the insulin signaling pathway.&lt;ref name="pharmacological1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vincent|first1=JB|title=Is the Pharmacological Mode of Action of Chromium(III) as a Second Messenger?|journal=Biological Trace Element Research|volume=166|issue=1|pages=7–12|date=2015|pmid=25595680|doi=10.1007/s12011-015-0231-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dietary recommendations ===
There is disagreement on chromium's status as an essential nutrient. Governmental departments from Australia, New Zealand, India, Japan and the United States consider chromium essential&lt;ref name=AustraliaNZ /&gt;&lt;ref name=India /&gt;&lt;ref name=Japan /&gt;&lt;ref name=IOM-Chromium/&gt; while the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA), representing the European Union, does not.&lt;ref name=EFSA /&gt;

The [[National Academy of Medicine]] (NAM) updated the [[Dietary Reference Intake#Parameters|Estimated Average Requirements]] (EARs) and the [[Dietary Reference Intake#Parameters|Recommended Dietary Allowances]] (RDAs) for chromium in 2001. For chromium, there was not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so its needs are described as estimates for [[Dietary Reference Intake#Parameters|Adequate Intakes]] (AIs). The current AIs of chromium for women ages 14 through 50 is 25 μg/day, and the AIs for women ages 50 and above is 20 μg/day. The AIs for women who are pregnant are 30 μg/day, and for women who are lactating, the set AIs are 45 μg/day. The AIs for men ages 14 through 50 are 35 μg/day, and the AIs for men ages 50 and above are 30 μg/day. For children ages 1 through 13, the AIs increase with age from 0.2 μg/day up to 25 μg/day. As for safety, the NAM sets [[Dietary Reference Intake#Parameters|Tolerable Upper Intake Levels]] (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when the evidence is sufficient. In the case of chromium, there is not yet enough information and hence no UL has been established.

For the [[United States|United States']] food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount of the substance in a serving is expressed as a percent of the [[Reference Daily Intake|Daily Value]] (%DV).

=== Supplementation ===
Chromium is an ingredient in [[total parenteral nutrition]] (TPN) because deficiency can occur after months of intravenous feeding with chromium-free TPN. For this reason, chromium is added to TPN solutions, along with other trace minerals.&lt;ref name=Stehle2016/&gt; It is also in nutritional products for [[preterm infant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid = 25527182|year = February 2015|last1 = Finch|first1 = Carolyn Weiglein|title = Review of trace mineral requirements for preterm infants: What are the current recommendations for clinical practice?|journal=Nutrition in Clinical Practice|volume = 30|issue = 1|pages = 44–58|doi = 10.1177/0884533614563353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the mechanism in biological roles for chromium is unclear, in the United States chromium-containing products are sold as non-prescription dietary supplements in amounts ranging from 50 to 1,000 μg. Lower amounts of chromium are also often incorporated into multi-vitamin/mineral supplements consumed by an estimated 31% of adults in the United States.&lt;ref name=Kantor2016/&gt; Chemical compounds used in dietary supplements include chromium chloride, chromium citrate, [[chromium(III) picolinate]], [[Chromium polynicotinate|chromium(III) polynicotinate]], and other chemical compositions.&lt;ref name=ods/&gt; The benefit of supplements has not been proven.&lt;ref name=ods/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vincent2010&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1039/B920480F|title = Chromium: Celebrating 50 years as an essential element?|date = 2010|last1 = Vincent|first1 = John B|journal = Dalton Transactions|volume = 39|issue = 16|pages = 3787–3794|pmid = 20372701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Approved and disapproved health claims ====
In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved a Qualified Health Claim for chromium picolinate with a requirement for very specific label wording: "One small study suggests that chromium picolinate may reduce the risk of insulin resistance, and therefore possibly may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. FDA concludes, however, that the existence of such a relationship between chromium picolinate and either insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes is highly uncertain." At the same time, in answer to other parts of the petition, the FDA rejected claims for chromium picolinate and cardiovascular disease, retinopathy or kidney disease caused be abnormally high blood sugar levels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20171114183739/https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm073017.htm FDA Qualified Health Claims: Letters of Enforcement Discretion, Letters of Denial] U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Docket #2004Q-0144 (August 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, chromium(III) picolinate was approved by Health Canada to be used in dietary supplements. Approved labeling statements include: a factor in the maintenance of good health, provides support for healthy glucose metabolism, helps the body to metabolize carbohydrates and helps the body to metabolize fats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/monoReq.do?id=65 |title = Monograph: Chromium (from Chromium picolinate)|publisher = Health Canada|date = 9 December 2009|accessdate = 18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) approved claims in 2010 that chromium contributed to normal macronutrient metabolism and maintenance of normal blood glucose concentration, but rejected claims for maintenance or achievement of a normal body weight, or reduction of tiredness or fatigue.&lt;ref name=EFSA2010&gt;[https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1732 Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to chromium and contribution to normal macronutrient metabolism (ID 260, 401, 4665, 4666, 4667), maintenance of normal blood glucose concentrations (ID 262, 4667), contribution to the maintenance or achievement of a normal body weight (ID 339, 4665, 4666), and reduction of tiredness and fatigue (ID 261) pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006] European Food Safety Authority EFSA J 2010;8(10)1732.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diabetes ====
Given the evidence for chromium deficiency causing problems with glucose management in the context of intravenous nutrition products formulated without chromium,&lt;ref name=Stehle2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Stehle|first1 = P|last2 = Stoffel-Wagner|first2 = B|last3 = Kuh|first3 = KS|title = Parenteral trace element provision: recent clinical research and practical conclusions|journal = European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume = 70|issue = 8|pages = 886–893|date = 6 April 2014|pmid = 27049031|pmc = 5399133|doi = 10.1038/ejcn.2016.53|url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; research interest turned to whether chromium supplementation for people who have type 2 diabetes but are not chromium deficient could benefit. Looking at the results from four meta-analyses, one reported a statistically significant decrease in fasting [[plasma glucose]] levels (FPG) and a non-significant trend in lower [[Glycated hemoglobin|hemoglobin A1C]].&lt;ref name=Mauro&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=San Mauro-Martin I, Ruiz-León AM, Camina-Martín MA, Garicano-Vilar E, Collado-Yurrita L, Mateo-Silleras B, Redondo P |title=[Chromium supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes and high risk of type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials] |language = Spanish|journal = Nutr Hosp|volume = 33|issue = 1|pages = 27|date = 2016|pmid = 27019254|doi = 10.20960/nh.v33i1.27|url = |doi-broken-date = 11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second reported the same,&lt;ref name=Abdoll2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Abdollahi|first1 = M|last2 = Farshchi|first2 = A|last3 = Nikfar|first3 = S|last4 = Seyedifar|first4 = M|title = Effect of chromium on glucose and lipid profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes; a meta-analysis review of randomized trials|journal = J Pharm Pharm Sci|volume = 16|issue = 1|pages = 99–114|date = 2013|pmid = 23683609|doi = |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; a third reported significant decreases for both measures,&lt;ref name=Suk2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Suksomboon|first1 = N|last2 = Poolsup|first2 = N|last3 = Yuwanakorn|first3 = A|title = Systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of chromium supplementation in diabetes|journal = J Clin Pharm Ther|volume = 39|issue = 3|pages = 292–306|date = 17 March 2013|pmid = 24635480|doi = 10.1111/jcpt.12147 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a fourth reported no benefit for either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Bailey|first1 = Christopher H|title = Improved meta-analytic methods show no effect of chromium supplements on fasting glucose|journal = Biol Trace Elem Res|volume = 157|issue = 1|pages = 1–8|date = January 2014|pmid = 24293356|doi = 10.1007/s12011-013-9863-9|url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review published in 2016 listed 53 [[randomized clinical trial]]s that were included in one or more of six [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]].

==== Weight management ====
Two [[systematic review]]s looked at chromium supplements as a mean of managing body weight in overweight and obese people. One, limited to [[chromium picolinate]], a popular supplement ingredient, reported a statistically significant -1.1&amp;nbsp;kg (2.4&amp;nbsp;lb) weight loss in trials longer than 12 weeks.&lt;ref name=Tian2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Tian|first1 = Honglian|last2 = Guo|first2 = Xiaohu|last3 = Wang|first3 = Xiyu|last4 = He|first4 = Zhiyun|last5 = Sun|first5 = Rao|last6 = Ge|first6 = Sai|last7 = Zhang|first7 = Zongjiu|title = Chromium picolinate supplementation for overweight or obese adults|journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume = |issue = 11|pages = CD010063|date = 2013|pmid = 24293292 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010063.pub2 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other included all chromium compounds and reported a statistically significant -0.50&amp;nbsp;kg (1.1&amp;nbsp;lb) weight change.&lt;ref name = Onakpoya2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Onakpoya|first1 = I|last2 = Posadzki|first2 = P|last3 = Ernst|first3 = E|title = Chromium supplementation in overweight and obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials|journal = Obes Rev|volume = 14|issue = 6|pages = 496–507|date = 2013|pmid = 23495911|doi = 10.1111/obr.12026|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Change in percent body fat did not reach statistical significance. Authors of both reviews considered the clinical relevance of this modest weight loss as uncertain/unreliable.&lt;ref name=Tian2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Onakpoya2013/&gt; The [[European Food Safety Authority]] reviewed the literature and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support a claim.&lt;ref name=EFSA2010/&gt;

==== Athletic performance ====
Chromium is promoted as a sports performance dietary supplement, based on the theory that it potentiated insulin activity, with anticipated results of increased muscle mass, and faster recovery of glycogen storage during post-exercise recovery.&lt;ref name=Vincent2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lefavi RG, Anderson RA, Keith RE, Wilson GD, McMillan JL, Stone MH |title=Efficacy of chromium supplementation in athletes: emphasis on anabolism |journal=Int J Sport Nutr |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=111–122 |date=1992 |pmid=1299487 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vinvent2003&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vincent JB |title=The potential value and toxicity of chromium picolinate as a nutritional supplement, weight loss agent and muscle development agent |journal=Sports Med |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=213–230 |date=2003 |pmid=12656641 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of clinical trials reported that chromium supplementation did not improve exercise performance or increase muscle strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jenkinson DM, Harbert AJ |title=Supplements and sports |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=78 |issue=9 |pages=1039–1046 |date=2008 |pmid=19007050 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Olympic Committee reviewed dietary supplements for high-performance athletes in 2018 and concluded there was no need to increase chromium intake for athletes, nor support for claims of losing body fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maughan RJ, Burke LM, et al. |title=IOC Consensus Statement: Dietary Supplements and the High-Performance Athlete |journal=Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=104–125 |date=2018 |pmid=29589768 |doi=10.1123/ijsnem.2018-0020 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precautions ==
{{Main|Chromium toxicity}}
Water-insoluble chromium(III) compounds and chromium metal are not considered a health hazard, while the toxicity and carcinogenic properties of chromium(VI) have been known for a long time.&lt;ref name="Barceloux"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Chromium|first = Donald G|last = Barceloux|journal = Clinical Toxicology|volume = 37|issue = 2|pages = 173–194|date = 1999|doi = 10.1081/CLT-100102418|last2 = Barceloux|first2 = Donald|pmid = 10382554}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the specific transport mechanisms, only limited amounts of chromium(III) enter the cells. Several ''in vitro'' studies indicated that high concentrations of chromium(III) in the cell can lead to DNA damage.&lt;ref name="Eastmond"&gt;{{cite journal
|last = Eastmond |first = DA |date = 2008|title = Trivalent Chromium: Assessing the Genotoxic Risk of an Essential Trace Element and Widely Used Human and Animal Nutritional Supplement |journal = Critical Reviews in Toxicology |volume = 38 |issue = 3 |pages = 173–190 |doi = 10.1080/10408440701845401 |last2 = MacGregor|first2 = JT|last3 = Slesinski|first3 = RS|pmid = 18324515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acute oral toxicity ranges between 1.5 and 3.3&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite journal |title = The toxicology of chromium with respect to its chemical speciation: A review |first = SA|last = Katz|journal = Journal of Applied Toxicology|volume = 13|issue = 3|pages = 217–224|date = 1992|doi = 10.1002/jat.2550130314|pmid = 8326093|last2 = Salem|first2 = H}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 review suggested that moderate uptake of chromium(III) through dietary supplements poses no genetic-toxic risk.&lt;ref name="Eastmond"/&gt; In the US, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has designated a [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) in the workplace as a time-weighted average (TWA) of 1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, time-weighted average. The [[IDLH]] (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 250&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup href="aerospace"&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{PGCH|0141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chromium(VI) toxicity ===
The acute [[mouth|oral]] [[toxicity]] for [[Hexavalent chromium|chromium(VI)]] ranges between 50 and 150&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref name="Katz"/&gt; In the body, chromium(VI) is reduced by several mechanisms to chromium(III) already in the blood before it enters the cells. The chromium(III) is excreted from the body, whereas the chromate ion is transferred into the cell by a transport mechanism, by which also [[sulfate]] and [[phosphate]] ions enter the cell. The acute toxicity of chromium(VI) is due to its strong [[oxidation]]al properties. After it reaches the blood stream, it damages the kidneys, the liver and blood cells through oxidation reactions. [[Hemolysis]], [[renal]], and liver failure result. Aggressive dialysis can be therapeutic.&lt;ref name="Dayan"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Mechanisms of chromium toxicity, carcinogenicity and allergenicity: Review of the literature from 1985 to 2000 |first = AD|last = Dayan |journal = Human &amp; Experimental Toxicology |volume=20 |issue=9|pages = 439–451 |date=2001 |doi = 10.1191/096032701682693062 |last2 = Paine |first2 = AJ |pmid=11776406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[carcinogenity]] of chromate dust has been known for a long time, and in 1890 the first publication described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a chromate dye company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = A case of adeno-carcinoma of the left inferior turbinated body, and perforation of thenasal septum, in the person of a worker in chrome pigments |first = D.|last = Newman |journal = Glasgow Medical Journal |volume = 33|pages = 469–470 |date=1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langard"&gt;{{cite journal |title = One Hundred Years of Chromium and Cancer: A Review of Epidemiological Evidence and Selected Case Reports |first = S |last = Langard |journal = American Journal of Industrial Medicine |volume = 17 |issue = 2|pages = 189–214 |date = 1990 |doi = 10.1002/ajim.4700170205 |pmid = 2405656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three mechanisms have been proposed to describe the [[genotoxicity]] of chromium(VI). The first mechanism includes highly reactive [[hydroxyl radical]]s and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the [[DNA]]. The last mechanism attributed the genotoxicity to the binding to the DNA of the end product of the chromium(III) reduction.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Mechanisms of chromium carcinogenicity and toxicity |first = MD|last = Cohen|journal = Critical Reviews in Toxicology |volume=23 |issue = 3|pages=255–281 |date=1993 |doi = 10.3109/10408449309105012 |last2 = Kargacin |first2 = B |last3 = Klein |first3 = CB |last4 = Costa |first4 = M |pmid = 8260068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Methods to Develop Inhalation Cancer Risk Estimates for Chromium and Nickel Compounds|date=2011|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Health and Environmental Impacts Division|location=Research Triangle Park, NC|url=https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo56032|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromium salts (chromates) are also the cause of [[allergic reaction]]s in some people. Chromates are often used to manufacture, amongst other things, leather products, paints, cement, mortar and anti-corrosives. Contact with products containing chromates can lead to allergic [[contact dermatitis]] and irritant dermatitis, resulting in ulceration of the skin, sometimes referred to as "chrome ulcers". This condition is often found in workers that have been exposed to strong chromate solutions in electroplating, tanning and chrome-producing manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = DermNet NZ|last = Ngan|first = V|date = 2002|title = Chrome Allergy|url = http://dermnetnz.org/dermatitis/chrome-allergy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Investigation of the threshold for allergic reactivity to chromium|last1 = Basketter|first1 = David|last2 = Horev|first2 = L|last3 = Slodovnik|first3 = D|last4 = Merimes|first4 = S|last5 = Trattner|first5 = A|last6 = Ingber|first6 = A|journal = Contact Dermatitis|volume = 44|issue = 2|pages = 70–74|date = 2000|doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0536.2001.440202.x|pmid = 11205406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental issues ===
Because chromium compounds were used in [[dye]]s, [[paint]]s, and [[leather]] [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] compounds, these compounds are often found in soil and [[groundwater]] at active and abandoned industrial sites, needing [[environmental cleanup]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]]. [[Primer (paint)|Primer paint]] containing hexavalent chromium is still widely used for [[aerospace]] and [[automobile]] refinishing applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first = Randall C|last = Baselt|title = Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man|edition = 8th|publisher = Biomedical Publications|date=2008 |pages = 305–307|isbn = 978-0-9626523-7-0|place = Foster City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Environmental Working Group]] studied the drinking water in 35 American cities in the first nationwide study. The study found measurable hexavalent chromium in the tap water of 31 of the cities sampled, with [[Norman, Oklahoma]], at the top of list; 25 cities had levels that exceeded California's proposed limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/healthusenvironmentpollutionwater|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101223164916/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/healthusenvironmentpollutionwater|archivedate = 23 December 2010|publisher = [[Yahoo News]]|title = US water has large amounts of likely carcinogen: study|date = 19 December 2010|accessdate = 19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''Composition H6''' is a [[Casting|castable]] military [[explosive]] mixture composed of the following percentages by weight:&lt;ref name="GovAu"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://dspace.dsto.defence.gov.au/dspace/bitstream/1947/3621/1/DSTO-TN-0049%20PR.pdf |title=A Critical Diameter Study of the Australian Manufactured Underwater Explosive Composition H6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* 44.0% [[RDX]] 
* 29.5% [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]]
* 21.0% [[Powder (substance)|powdered]] [[aluminum]]
* 5.0% [[paraffin wax]] as a [[phlegmatized|phlegmatizing]] agent.
* 0.5% [[calcium chloride]]

H6 is used in a number of military applications, notably underwater munitions (e.g. [[naval mine]]s, [[depth charge]]s and [[torpedo]]es) where it has generally replaced [[torpex]], being less shock sensitive and having more stable storage characteristics. It is approximately 1.35 times more powerful than pure TNT.

'''Conductor marking lights''' are a particular type of [[aircraft warning lights]] designed  for overhead [[power lines]]. They are visible at night, unlike [[overhead wire marker]]s which rely on daylight. 
[[Image:Conductor_marking_lights.png|thumb|300px|Conductor marking lights]]

==Background==
Power distribution on [[overhead power lines]], often suspended to widely spaced masts, represents an almost invisible obstacle to low flying aircraft, requiring the installation of warning beacons on the masts themselves. 
A simple and cost-effective solution to this problem is installing the marking lights directly on the wires. 
Nevertheless, there are significant technical difficulties to a low-cost extraction of power from a distribution system which carries high voltages and wide-range [[AC current]]. 
Moreover, the warning system should not add to the existing power distribution lines the burden of additional cabling, with its potential serious isolation problems. These facts rule out the recourse to conventionally powered light sources.

==Power supply == 
The ideal warning light must be able to power itself while clamped to a single wire of the line. Lights may be powered either from the [[electric field]] surrounding the energized wire, or the [[magnetic field]] produced by current through the wire.  The first approach takes advantage of the high electric potential [[gradient]] between conductors, but a strong enough [[capacitive coupling]] is requested to allow capacitive extraction of the power required from the warning light. This means that long conductors must be suspended parallel to the line using glass/ceramic isolators: in fact several meters of suspended conductor are generally required, total length being inversely proportional to the line voltage. The second approach is based on [[Faraday's law of induction]] involving [[magnetic flux]] flowing through a circuit which powers the warning light.

==Inductive coupling device==
[[Image:Clampco_Sistemi_inductive_coupling_device.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Inductive coupling device (about 8 kg weight)]]
This beacon is powered by  the magnetic field surrounding the power distribution wire and uses an electronic circuit integrated in a compact clamp-on warning light. The operating principle is that of a [[Rogowski coil]], similar to a [[current transformer]]. This solution is usually intended for medium and high voltage lines up to 440 kV. However inductive coupling devices are able to work on any [[Alternating current|AC]] at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, from 15 up to 2000 Amps.

In [[astronomy]] and in [[astrophysics]], for '''radiative losses of the solar corona''', it is meant the [[energy flux]] [[radiance|radiated]] from the external [[atmosphere]] of the [[Sun]] (traditionally divided into [[chromosphere]], [[solar transition region|transition region]] and [[corona]]), and, in particular, the processes of production of the [[radiation]] coming from the solar corona and transition region, where the plasma is optically-thin. On the contrary, in the chromosphere, where the temperature decreases from the photospheric value of 6000 K to the minimum of 4400 K, the [[optical depth]] is about 1, and the radiation is thermal.

[[File:Latest xrt soft x-ray.gif|thumb|right|320px|The Sun in the soft X-rays as seen by the [[Hinode]] X-ray Telescope (XRT) on 15 Oct 2009.]]

The [[corona]] extends much further than a solar radius from the [[photosphere]] and looks very complex and inhomogeneous in the [[X-rays]] images taken by satellites (see the figure on the right taken by the XRT on board [[Hinode]]).
The structure and dynamics of the [[corona]] are dominated by the [[solar magnetic field]]. There are strong evidences that even the heating mechanism, responsible for its high temperature of million degrees, is linked to the magnetic field of the [[Sun]].

The [[energy flux]] irradiated from the corona changes in [[stellar active region|active regions]], in the quiet Sun and in [[coronal holes]]; actually,  part of the energy is irradiated outwards, but approximately the same amount of the energy flux is conducted back towards the [[chromosphere]], through the steep [[solar transition region|transition region]]. In active regions the energy flux is about 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; erg cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, in the quiet Sun it is roughly 8 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;– 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; erg cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and in coronal holes 5 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; - 8 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; erg cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, including the losses due to the solar wind.

The required power is a small fraction of the total flux irradiated from the Sun, but this energy is enough to maintain the plasma at the temperature of million degrees, since the density is very low and the processes of radiation are different from those occurring in the photosphere,  as it is shown in detail in the next section.

== Processes of radiation of the solar corona ==

[[File:EffectiveTemperature 300dpi e it.png|thumb|right|320px|The [[effective temperature]] of the Sun. The grey area represents the [[blackbody radiation]] with the same radiative flux of the solar spectrum (yellow area).]]
The electromagnetic waves coming from the solar [[corona]] are emitted mainly in the [[X-rays]]. This radiation is not visible from the Earth because it is filtered by the atmosphere. Before the first rocket missions, the corona could be observed only in white light during the eclipses, while in the last fifty years the solar corona has been photographed in the EUV and X-rays by many satellites ([[Pioneer program|Pioneer]] 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, [[Helios]], [[Skylab]], [[Solar Maximum Mission|SMM]], [[NIXT]], [[Yohkoh]], [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]], [[TRACE]], [[Hinode]]).

The emitting plasma is almost completely ionized and very light, its density is about 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt; g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Particles are so isolated that almost all the [[photons]] can leave the [[Sun]]'s surface without interacting with the matter above the [[photosphere]]: in other words, the corona is transparent to the radiation and the emission of the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is optically-thin. The Sun's atmosphere is not the unique example of [[Astronomical X-ray source|X-ray source]], since hot plasmas are present wherever in the Universe: from stellar coronae to thin [[galactic halo]]s. These stellar environments are the subject of the [[X-ray astronomy]].

In an optically-thin plasma the matter is not in thermodynamical equilibrium with the radiation, because collisions between particles and photons are very rare, and, as a matter of fact, the square root mean velocity of photons, electrons, protons and ions is not the same: we should define a temperature for each of these particle populations. The result is that the [[emission spectrum]] does not fit the spectral distribution of a [[blackbody radiation]], but it depends only on those collisional processes which occur in a very rarefied plasma.

[[File:FraunhoferLinesDiagram.jpg|thumb|right|320px| [[Fraunhofer lines]] in the solar spectrum.]]
While the [[Fraunhofer lines]] coming from the [[photosphere]] are [[absorption lines]], principally emitted from ions which absorb photons of the same frequency of the transition to an upper energy level, coronal lines are [[emission lines]] produced by metal ions which had been excited to a superior state by collisional processes. Many spectral lines are emitted by highly ionized atoms, like calcium and iron, which have lost most of their external electrons; these emission lines can be formed only at certain temperatures, and therefore their individuation in solar [[spectrum|spectra]] is sufficient to determine the temperature of the emitting plasma.

Some of these spectral lines can be forbidden on the Earth: in fact, collisions between particles can excite ions to metastable states; in a dense gas these ions immediately collide with other particles and so they de-excite with an allowed transition to an intermediate level, while in the corona it is more probable that this ion remains in its metastable state, until it encounters a photon of the same frequency of the forbidden transition to the lower state. This photon induces the ion to emit with the same frequency by [[stimulated emission]]. Forbidden transitions from metastable states are often called as satellite lines.

The [[Spectroscopy]] of the corona allows the determination of many physical parameters of the emitting plasma. Comparing the [[Luminous intensity|intensity]] in lines of different ions of the same element, temperature and density can be measured with a good approximation: the different states of ionization are regulated by the [[Saha equation]].
The [[Doppler shift]] gives a good measurement of the velocities along the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] but not in the perpendicular plane.
The [[line width]] should depend on the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] of velocities at the temperature of line formation (thermal line broadening), while it is often larger than predicted.
The widening can be due to [[pressure broadening]], when collisions between particles are frequent, or it can be due to [[turbulence]]: in this case the line width can be used to estimate the macroscopic velocity also on the Sun's surface, but with a great uncertainty.
The magnetic field can be measured thanks to the line splitting due to the [[Zeeman effect]].

are
*the emission in resonance lines of ionized metals (bound-bound emission);
*the radiative recombinations (free-bound radiation) due to the most abundant coronal ions;
*for very high temperatures above 10 MK, the [[bremsstrahlung]] (free-free emission).

Therefore, the radiative flux can be expressed as the sum of three terms:

&lt;math&gt;
L_r = n_e \sum n_l C_{lk} h \nu_{lk} + L_{rec} + L_{brems}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[electrons]] per unit volume, &lt;math&gt;n_k&lt;/math&gt; the [[ion]] number density, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; the [[Planck constant]],  &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; the frequency of the emitted radiation corresponding to the energy jump  &lt;math&gt;h\nu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C_{lk}&lt;/math&gt; the coefficient of collisional de-excitation relative to the ion transition, &lt;math&gt;L_{rec}&lt;/math&gt; the radiative losses for [[plasma recombination]] and &lt;math&gt;L_{brems}&lt;/math&gt; the [[bremsstrahlung]] contribution.

The first term is due to the emission in every single [[spectral line]]. With a good approximation, the number of occupied states at the superior level &lt;math&gt; n_u &lt;/math&gt;  and the number of states at the inferior energy level &lt;math&gt; n_l &lt;/math&gt; are given by the equilibrium between collisional excitation and [[spontaneous emission]]

&lt;math&gt;
n_l n_e C_{lu} =n_u A_{ul}
&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;A_{lu}&lt;/math&gt;
is the transition probability of spontaneous emission.

The second term &lt;math&gt;L_{rec}&lt;/math&gt; is calculated as the energy emitted per unit volume and time when free electrons are captured from ions to recombinate into neutral atoms (dielectronic capture).

The third term &lt;math&gt;L_{brems}&lt;/math&gt; is due to the electron scattering by protons and ions because of the [[Coulomb force]]: every accelerated charge emits radiation according to classical elettrodynamics. This effect gives an appreciable contribution to the continuum spectrum only at the highest temperatures, above 10 MK.

Taking into account all the dominant radiation processes, including satellite lines from metastable states, the emission of an optically-thin plasma can be expressed more simply as

&lt;math&gt;
L_{r}=n_{e} n_{H} P(T)~~ {W~m^{-3}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P(T)&lt;/math&gt; depends only on the temperature. In fact, all the radiation mechanisms require collisional processes and basically depend on the squared density (&lt;math&gt; n_{e}=n_{H}&lt;/math&gt;). The integral of the squared density along the line of sight is called emission measure and is often used in [[X-ray astronomy]].
The function &lt;math&gt;P(T)&lt;/math&gt; has been modeled by many authors but many discrepancies are still in these calculations: differences derive essentially on the spectral lines they include in their models and on the atomic parameters they use.

In order to calculate the radiative flux from an optically-thin plasma, it can be used the linear fitting applied to some model calculations by Rosner et al. (1978)
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In c.g.s. unit, in  erg cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, the function P(T) can be approximated as:

&lt;math&gt;P(T) \approx 10^{-21.85} ~~~~~~~~~~~(10^{4.3} &lt; T &lt; 10^{4.6} K) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P(T) \approx 10^{-31}~T^{2} ~~~~~~~~~(10^{4.6} &lt; T &lt; 10^{4.9} K) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P(T) \approx 10^{-21.2} ~~~~~~~~~~~~ (10^{4.9} &lt; T &lt; 10^{5.4} K) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P(T) \approx 10^{-10.4}~T^{-2} ~~~~~~(10^{5.4} &lt; T &lt; 10^{5.75} K) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P(T) \approx 10^{-21.94} ~~~~~~~~~~~(10^{5.75} &lt; T &lt; 10^{6.3} K) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P(T) \approx 10^{-17.73}~T^{-2/3}~~~(10^{6.3} &lt; T &lt; 10^{7} K) &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:FiatEV.jpg|thumb|right|150px|This elderly [[Fiat]] employs batteries that can be mounted in any position]]

In [[automobile engineering]], '''electric vehicle conversion''' is the replacement of a car's [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]] and connected components with an [[electric motor]] and [[electric vehicle batteries|batteries]], to create an [[electric vehicle|all-electric vehicle]]. Another option is to replace a large combustion engine with an electric motor (for power) and a small combustion engine (for speed), creating a [[hybrid electric vehicle]] or a [[EAA-PHEV|plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]].

The general trend appears to be that ground vehicles will "go electric,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/12/the-lowdown-on-electric-vehicles-and-the-future-of-driving.html |title=The lowdown on electric vehicles and the future of driving |first=Anmar |last=Frangoul |work=CNBC |location=US |date=12 February 2018 |access-date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and automakers have slowly but steadily responded to public demand by producing both hybrid electric vehicles which get {{cvt|45-90|mpgus|l/100 km mpgus|disp=out}} gasoline, and electric vehicles which get similar or better mileage by [[mpg equivalent]] efficiency rating. 

In general, commercially-manufactured [[electric vehicle]]s are inhibited by the limited range per charge of batteries (up to {{convert|350|miles|km|order=flip|disp=comma|abbr=in}}), battery charge times that are slower than gasoline filling times, apparent greater initial cost over combustion engines, and potentially high service costs for used or worn-out batteries.  Electric conversions are often inhibited by either the difficult labor and specialized knowledge involved in a [[do-it-yourself]] (DIY) conversion, or the expense of a purchased conversion service with conversion components, often costing {{USD|8-12 thousand}}. There is a small but steadily growing DIY community for electric conversions.

== Simple steps ==
Assumes a simple design of a DC or AC motor. 
* Obtain an electric motor, electric vehicle (EV) [[motor controller]], and batteries which match the car size and the performance characteristics (range, speed, power) desired. Smaller vehicles can use smaller ("8 inch") motors, and larger vehicles will require larger electric motors. 
* Remove the combustion engine, fuel tank, muffler and exhaust, and other ICE related components. 
* Keep the transmission, and design an adapter out of an aluminum plate material, or steel tubing, which will accept the electric motor and mount it to the transmission at the precise distance. Adapter plate machining (and other machining jobs) can be outsourced to a machinist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.instructables.com/id/Build-your-own-Electric-Car/ |title=Build Your Own Electric Car!: 9 Steps (with Pictures) |first=Ben |last=Nelson |work=Instructables |date=9 July 2017 |access-date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Design a coupler for connecting the motor shaft to the transmission. 
* Mount the motor to the transmission, with coupler and adapter firmly mounted.
* Build compartments to house the batteries. Cutting out part of the auto body is possible, and steel tubing should be used to frame the compartment.
* Install the batteries and the motor controller, linking them up to the motor.

*Almost ''any'' vehicle can be converted to electric. Many people prefer to pick a vehicle that is light and aerodynamic in order to maximize distance traveled per battery charge. There must also be adequate room and load capacity for batteries.
* If obtaining a vehicle for conversion, chose a car which has an undamaged body (unless also doing the body work). 
*The [[battery pack]], which provides a source of electrical power. The most commonly available and affordable batteries are [[lead-acid battery|lead-acid]] flooded type. Next are the [[Absorbent glass mat|AGM (Absorption Glass Mat)]] sealed maintenance free batteries, a little more powerful and expensive. Then there are the more exotic batteries like [[Nickel-metal hydride battery|Ni-MH]] and [[Lithium-ion battery|Li-ion]]; more difficult to find but light and longer lasting, maintenance free, and much more expensive. The new lithium batteries are showing some promise for EVs in the near future.
*The charger which restores energy to the batteries (which may be mounted within the vehicle or at a special charging station at some fixed location)
*The [[motor controller|power controller]], which regulates the flow of energy between the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] and the [[electric motor]](s), controlled by an [[electronic throttle]].
*One or more electric motors and their mechanical attachment to the [[driveline]]
*[[Electrical cable|Power conductor]]s connecting the battery, controller, and motor(s)
*Accessory equipment to power auxiliary equipment such as power brakes and heating system
*Control circuitry and equipment to allow control and interlocking of the various components
*Instrumentation specific to the operation and maintenance of the conversion

==Hobbyists and conversions==

Hobbyists often build their own EVs by converting existing production cars to run solely on electricity. There is a [[cottage industry]] supporting the conversion and construction of BEVs by hobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Franz|first=Paul|title=Turning Old Gas Guzzlers into Electric Vehicles|url=http://www.time.com/time/video/player/0,32068,990054967001_2077261,00.html|publisher=TIME|accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Universities such as the [[University of California, Irvine]] even build their own custom electric or hybrid-electric cars from scratch.

Short-range battery electric vehicles can offer the hobbyist comfort, utility, and quickness, sacrificing only range. Short-range EVs may be built using high-performance lead–acid batteries, using about half the mass needed for a {{convert|100-130|km|round=5|abbr=in}} range. The result is a vehicle with about a {{convert|50|km|round=5|abbr=in}} range, which, when designed with appropriate weight distribution (40/60 front to rear), does not require [[power steering]], offers exceptional acceleration in the lower end of its operating range, and is freeway capable and legal. But their EVs are expensive due to the higher cost for these higher-performance batteries. By including a [[manual transmission]], short-range EVs can obtain both better performance and greater efficiency than the single-speed EVs developed by major manufacturers. Unlike the converted golf carts used for [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s, short-range EVs may be operated on typical suburban throughways (where {{convert|60-80|km/h|mph|abbr=on|round=5|disp=comma}} speed limits are typical) and can keep up with traffic typical on such roads and the short "slow-lane" on-and-off segments of freeways common in suburban areas.

Faced with chronic fuel shortage on the [[Gaza Strip]], Palestinian electrical engineer Waseem Othman al-Khozendar invented in 2008 a way to convert his car to run on 32 electric batteries. According to al-Khozendar, the batteries can be charged with {{USD|2}} worth of electricity to drive from {{convert|180-240|km|abbr=on}}. After a 7-hour charge, the car should also be able to run up to a speed of {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on|-1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1209358045722&amp;pagename=Zone-English-News/NWELayout |title=Gaza Cars From Cooking Oil to Batteries |first=Motasem |last=Dalloul |accessdate=2009-04-27 |date=2008-05-29 |publisher=IslamOnline |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207063330/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1209358045722&amp;pagename=Zone-English-News%2FNWELayout |archivedate=7 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infolive.tv/en/infolive.tv-22806-israelnews-gaza-engineers-offer-alternative-gaza-fuel-crisis |title=Gaza Engineers Offer Alternative To Gaza Fuel Crisis |date=2008-08-21 |editor-last=Stephanov|editor-first=Rostik |accessdate=2009-04-27 |publisher=infolive.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, several Chinese manufacturers began marketing [[lithium iron phosphate battery|lithium iron phosphate ({{chem|LiFePO|4}}) batteries]] directly to hobbyists and vehicle conversion shops. These batteries offered much better power-to-weight ratios allowing vehicle conversions to typically achieve {{convert|75-150|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} per charge. Prices gradually declined to approximately {{USD|350}} per kW·h by mid-2009. As the {{chem|LiFePO|4}} cells feature life ratings of 3,000 cycles, compared to typical lead acid battery ratings of 300 cycles, the life expectancy of {{chem|LiFePO|4}} cells is around 10&amp;nbsp;years. {{chem|LiFePO|4}} cells require more expensive battery management and charging systems than lead acid batteries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Solar power==
{{Main|Solar vehicle}}
On-board solar cells can be used to power an electric vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarelectricalvehicles.com/ |title=Solar Electrical Vehicles |publisher=Solar Electrical Vehicles |date= |accessdate=27 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126042211/http://www.solarelectricalvehicles.com/ |archivedate=26 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/05/solar_hybrid_ca.php |title=Using Solar Roofs To Power Hybrids |publisher=TreeHugger |date= |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The small power generated by solar cells mounted on a vehicle means that the other components in the system must be special to compensate for this.
For example, the body of even a small conventional car converted to electric is still too heavy to be driven by on-board solar cells. A practical solar-powered vehicle is designed from the ground up with specially made parts.

==Conversion process==
Most conversions in North America are performed by hobbyists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franz|first=Paul|title=Turning Old Gas Guzzlers Into Electric Vehicles|url=http://www.time.com/time/video/player/0,32068,990054967001_2077261,00.html|publisher=TIME|accessdate=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who typically will convert a well used vehicle with a non-functioning engine, since such defective vehicles can be quite inexpensive to purchase. Other hobbyists with larger budgets may prefer to convert a later model vehicle, or a vehicle of a particular type. In some cases, the vehicle itself may be built by the converter, or assembled from a [[kit car]].

A two-stage vehicle is a vehicle that has been built by two separate manufacturers. The result is a standard, complete vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Titling - Homemade, Two-Stage or Reconstructed Vehicle|url = http://www.mva.maryland.gov/about-mva/info/27300/27300-31T.htm|website = www.mva.maryland.gov|accessdate = 2015-07-27|first = Helen|last = Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, vehicles may be converted by a manufacturer (as was done by [[Ford Motor Company]] to create the [[Ford Ranger EV]]). Alternatively, in a process known as "third-party [[powertrain|(power)trainization]]", an independent converter will purchase new [[vehicle glider]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy05osti/37567.pdf Vehicle analysis, pg 14] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; (vehicles without a motor or related equipment) and then perform the conversion, to offer a two-stage vehicle.

In some countries, the user can choose to buy a converted vehicle of any model in the [[Car dealership|automaker dealerships]] only paying the cost of the batteries and motor, with no installation costs (it is called pre-conversion or previous conversion).

==Industry==
The electric vehicle conversion industry has grown to include conversion car [[Garage (house)|garages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ev-blue.com |title=EV-Blue.com, Electric Vehicle Questions and Answers, EV-Blue.com, EV Blue, Electric Blue, evblue, evblue.com |publisher=Ev-blue.com |date= |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[aftermarket kit]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electroauto.com |title=Electro Automotive: Electric Car Conversion kits, Electric Vehicle Parts, &amp; EV Components |publisher=Electroauto.com |date= |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vehicle components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan Bohm |url=http://www.evsource.com |title=The Complete Electric Vehicle Resource |publisher=EVSource.com |date=16 March 2010 |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5hlhwjBoL40l46onAO3SB79gCtq5Q |title=Business up for electric car conversions |work=The Canadian Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203172254/https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5hlhwjBoL40l46onAO3SB79gCtq5Q |date=30 November 2008 |archivedate=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vehicle types==

===Electric bicycle===
[[File:Electricbike1raleigh.JPG|thumb|A bicycle with an aftermarket hub-motor in the front wheel]]
An [[electric bicycle]] is a conventional bicycle that has been fitted with an electric motor. Converting an existing bicycle by retrofitting it with a "conversion kit" is the simplest and least expensive electric vehicle conversion option. Most often electric bicycles or "e-bikes" are powered by rechargeable batteries however some experimental electric bicycles run directly on or recharge their batteries via solar panels, fuel cells, gas generators or other alternative energy sources. Some experimenters have even used supercapacitors to store energy. Using an on-board generator may impact the legal jurisdictional definition of an electric bicycle. A few types of electric bicycles are able to re-capture a small amount of energy from braking and can re-charge the batteries while braking or traveling down hills (regenerative braking).

Some electric bikes have features where the motor can move the bicycle by itself (immediate start) if the rider chooses not to pedal with a button or throttle controller, while others require the rider to pedal at all times (pedal assist). This latter type may in some jurisdictions allow the vehicle to be used on bicycle trails that otherwise prohibit motorized vehicles of any kind (See [[motorized bicycle]]).

Many battery technologies are available for powering electric bikes. The most common and least expensive battery technology is sealed lead acid but [[Lithium iron phosphate battery|LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] is fast becoming the battery of choice for the e-bike.

Converting one's bike to electric with a conversion kit is an easy and affordable solution for most people interested in learning more about electric vehicle conversion.

There may be some problems with the warranty however on the original bicycle being converted, if an electric bike conversion kit is added.
Low-speed scooters are not typically suitable for on-the-road use. These may be configured for either standing or sitting use. Some local laws apply bicycle laws to scooters, such as helmet and pedestrian right-of-way considerations.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Economy coupe===
Owing to its light weight and efficiency, a light vehicle can make an excellent choice, particularly if care is taken in component selection and placement. It is possible to obtain conversion kits for some popular light vehicles, most notably the rear motor, rear drive [[Volkswagen Beetle]], its [[VW Type 3|Type 3]] evolution, and its successor, the front motor/drive [[VW Golf]].

By converting a light vehicle it is possible to use a smaller motor, which both weighs and costs less than a larger motor. A lighter overall vehicle weight will reduce power consumption in start-and-stop traffic and increase range in many practical driving conditions. In the same way that a gasoline-powered economy car is cheaper and more efficient to run, an electric-powered economy car is as well.

===Compact sedan or coupe===
A compact sedan may be a better choice than a subcompact owing to better load capacity and more room for battery placement. Some commercial EV Conversions use vehicles in this size range. One example is a 1992 [[Honda Civic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinev.org/evalbum/542.html |title=Bob Bath's 1992 Honda Civic DX Sedan |publisher=Austinev.org |date= |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this conversion, the back seat was retained, and there is still enough room to sink nine flooded lead-acid batteries low in the trunk where the spare tire was located, as well as another nine batteries under the hood. Another example is a 1987 [[Mitsubishi Tredia]] where the rear batteries have been raised above the trunk floorspace, sealed, and externally vented. With suspension modifications, increasing shock length &amp; spring rating, the car must still be below [[GVWR]], even with the driver and passengers. Exceeding the total design weight of the vehicle would be illegal in some states, and might result in cancellation by an insurance company.

There is an effort by several engineers in California to make the [[Toyota Prius]] a "[[Plug-in hybrid|Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle]]," or PHEV, whereby the first 40 miles are driven by all-electric power, then the gasoline engine comes on to re-charge the batteries, only if the commute is further than 40&amp;nbsp;mi. If it is less, one can just plug it into the utility grid to re-charge the batteries. The process is done by removing the [[Nickel-metal hydride battery|nickel-metal hydride batteries]], and installing different batteries, and a different battery management system.

Since 30 April 2009, the [[Electric Car Corporation]] have been selling the [[Citroën C1 ev'ie]], an all-electric conversion from the [[Citroën C1]].

===Full-size sedan===
[[Full-size sedan]]s and [[minivan]]s are generally considered to be poor candidates for EV conversion. As the suspension and tires are already operating close to the maximum permissible {{Clarify|date=September 2009}}&lt;!-- what does this mean? --&gt;, it may be necessary to make substantial modifications in these areas. It may be easier to obtain upgraded suspension components for some smaller vehicles, if these are also typically used for sports racing (particularly [[autocross]]). Starting with a heavy vehicle and adding batteries will result in poor performance in acceleration, handling, braking, and economy of operation.

One of the possibilities is using the body of Audi's D2 platform A8 (1994–2003) [[Audi A8]] or sports sedan S8 (1998–2003 or older European market models where the German model weights 1730&amp;nbsp;kg) [[Audi S8]] both of which are all [[aluminium]] [[monocoque]] "[[space frame|Audi Space Frame]]" vehicle, which helped to significantly reduce weight without being any less rigid.

===Sports car===
For a person interested in sports car performance and appearance, the creation of a satisfying conversion will likely lead to a number of difficulties in such details as battery disposition, as such vehicles generally have available space distributed in small volumes around the vehicle. This leads to complexity in securing and wiring batteries. These vehicles can offer stunning performance in the lower speed ranges owing to light weight and rear wheel drive, and may also offer good range due to their superior aerodynamics.

The 1969–1976 [[Porsche 914]] is one of the more successful sports car conversions, as well as being one of the most popular. Once converted, it boasts better performance in range, acceleration and top speed than most other vehicles. Also, its low acquisition costs contributes to its popularity as a conversion candidate. Some manufacturers of conversion kits have made a kit specific to the 914.

Another popular sports car used for conversion is the 1984–1989 [[Toyota MR2]]. Reasons for its popularity are low weight before conversion, low cost to purchase the car, and available locations within the car to place the large batteries that most people use (lead-acid and its derivative technologies). The later MR2 body style (Mark 2) does not seem as popular, and as of March 2008, there is only one known conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evalbum.com/33 |title=William Brinsmead's 1991 Toyota MR-2 |publisher=Evalbum.com |date=25 August 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1983 Mitsubishi Starion was converted to all-electric in 2009 by Carmel Morris and Nathan Bolton in Australia. This sports vehicle had divided front/rear battery load for well-balanced low center of gravity performance. The battery pack consisted of 45 x 3.2v nominal lithium-ion batteries. The tar weight of the final result was not much greater than the original specification, allowing the sports car to be engineering road-certified as a four-seat vehicle. The builders wanted to prove that an electric car conversion could also include other options such as power steering and air conditioning (as is the norm for new electric vehicles), without sacrificing excess energy or comfort. Information on the successful Electric Starion conversion can be found on the web.

The [[Bradley Automotive|Bradley]] GT II as well as other VW-based [[kit car]]s are very popular conversion candidates due to their being inexpensive, extensive support groups as well as their simple sports car design. Availability of conversion kits for these cars are quite prevalent with commercial retail establishments that specialize in EV conversions.

===Light truck===
Light trucks are especially suitable for hobbyist conversion because it is easy to locate batteries remote from the passenger compartment and there is a good load handling capacity for the use of heavy batteries such as the flooded lead-acid batteries commonly used in golf carts. Light trucks also offer substantial utility in use simply because they are trucks. Even if a portion of the weight capacity is removed by the presence of batteries within or below the cargo bed, much or all of the spatial utility remains. A light truck is highly recommended as a first conversion effort because of the simplicity of component layout. With proper battery placement the stability of a late production truck can be improved over the [[Internal combustion engine|ICE]] version. While a number of suitable vehicles are available in pre-2002 models, the modern evolution of this type has become taller, heavier, bulkier and less efficient, and their excessive height makes under-bed battery placement essential to keep the center of gravity low enough for stability on curves.

===Other trucks – full size and most SUVs===
These are rarely converted due to their excessive weight, and aerodynamic inefficiencies. To make the situation worse, many modern trucks and SUVs continue to get bulkier, heavier, and their high stance means the height of the center of gravity leads to instability while making high speed turns, a distinct disadvantage if there is not enough room between the frame rails to enable low battery mounting. As a direct result, the payload carrying capacity and thus the GVWR of the vehicles goes down. Such a trait is not desirable because it limits the weight of the battery pack that can be carried, limiting the maximum battery-to-vehicle weight ratio that could be achieved for the vehicle when converted to an EV. (Such considerations are important due to price, weight, and performance limitations of current battery technologies.)  For a given battery type, reducing the battery-to-vehicle weight ratio always results in reduced vehicle range per charge. However, despite these mostly unavoidable limitations, several SUVs and larger trucks have been successfully converted to electric power by hobbyists. Some examples include the "Gone Postal" van converted to an [[EV racer]] by 
[[Roderick Wilde]] and Suckamps EV Racing, the [[Land Rover]] EV converted by [[Wilde Evolutions]], and the 1988 [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] EV converted by [[Nick Viera]].

=== Classic Cars ===
Although technologically feasible, classic cars are not widely converted in order to maintain a car's authenticity. The German company ReeVOLT has however made it one of their business branches to convert old [[Trabant]]s for use in tourism in the east of Germany in connection to the car's regional historic significance and to allow easy access to environmental zones such as city centers and in particular the partially car-free island of [[Rügen]]. The car is considered ideal for conversions because of its low used price and low weight due to the small size and resin fiber construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-04/electric-trabi-combines-communist-past-with-silent-thrill |title=Electric Trabi Combines Communist Past With Silent Thrill |first=Naomi |last=Kresge |publisher=Bloomberg Business |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric buses===
The principal efforts in the development of autonomous [[electric bus]]es (this is, without [[Trolley bus|trolleys and wires]]) have involved limited production of very expensive [[fuel cell vehicle]]s.

The most economically effective development in this area involves the creation of [[hybrid electric buses]] (mainly [[plug-in hybrid]]s), well suited to this application owing to frequent stops and starts and effective [[energy recovery]] and release in this cycle.

Another solution is the conversion to [[battery electric bus]]es that follow the principle of [[charging station|replacing (discharged batteries)]] instead of recharging.

[[Transdev York]] in the [[United Kingdom]] currently operate the world's first diesel-engined buses that have been converted to full-electric propulsion. A fleet of five late 1990s [[Dennis Trident 2]] open-top double-decker buses, operated for a local [[City Sightseeing]] contract, have been converted from diesel to electric power.

===Racers===

====Hotrod====
While this type of vehicle is usually made to be a "[[Street-legal vehicle|street-legal]]" performance machine, it may also be developed for occasional use as a [[drag racing]] vehicle. The leading vehicle in this field is the "Maniac Mazda" a Mazda RX-7 sports car converted from rotary engine to electric by Roderick Wilde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evparts.com/spages/ABOUT.htm |title=About Us |publisher=EV Parts |accessdate=2 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104024845/http://www.evparts.com/spages/ABOUT.htm |archivedate=4 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This vehicle can outrun Dodge Viper and Ferrari sports cars in quarter-mile drag races.

====Autocross racer====
EV's have proven successful in autocross competition. The electric motor's ability to deliver maximum torque at 0 RPM and a comparatively broad torque band provide good throttle response and allow running an autocross without any time lost to shifting gears. The short distance of the typical autocross requires less stored energy than most forms of motorsports. This minimizes
electric vehicle's most obvious competitive disadvantage, the weight penalty of batteries compared to gasoline.

[[File:Batt mobile in autocross 2016.jpg|thumb|The Batt mobile in autocross 2016 in Queensland Australia]]

====Drag racer====
Intended only for specialized straight line quarter-mile (acceleration) racing this type of vehicle is used only "off road" at specialized "[[dragstrip]]s".

====High speed straight line racer====
:''For an example of a straight line racer see ''[[Buckeye Bullet]]
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Bullet.PNG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Buckeye Bullet]]]] --&gt;
Even more specialized than the drag racer, this is intended to obtain high speeds on long, straight, and flat raceways, such as the dry lake beds found in locations such as the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]].

====Closed circuit road racer====
Closed Circuit [[Road racing]], particularly any type of endurance racing, is one of the greatest challenges for EV's. Pound per pound, gasoline contains far more energy than even the most advanced of current batteries. An electric vehicle must be heavier or more efficient to run the same distance as its gasoline competitor. Endurance racing strategies include battery packs that can be changed quickly and "[[Dump charging]]"

===Custom chassis===
Suitable for a builder who is capable of constructing a kit car, with good abilities and equipment in machining and [[welding]] this can result in a unique vehicle. It is especially suitable for the construction of a lightweight vehicle that can offer exceptional performance. Many VW-based kit car companies have tube chassis ready to start with.

A glider kit includes all components of a vehicle except the [[power train]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dmv.ny.gov/broch/c18.htm | title = NYS DMV Brochure: Let the Buyer Be Aware | publisher = New York State Department of Motor Vehicles | date = | accessdate = 27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy05osti/37567.pdf |title=Energy Storage Fuel Cell Vehicle Analysis: Preprint |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.ak.us/dmv/dealer/sop_title/T240_glider_kit.htm |title=Glider Kits &amp; Kit Vehicles |publisher=State.ak.us |date=1 July 2006 |accessdate=27 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923155800/http://www.state.ak.us/dmv/dealer/sop_title/T240_glider_kit.htm |archivedate=23 September 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novelty vehicle===
A [[novelty vehicle]] or an electric powered [[art car]] may not be suitable for on-road use. Applications include electric vehicle show demonstrations, parades, parade floats, float towing, and eclectic off-road gatherings such as [[Burning Man]].
This vehicle is ideal for the [[beach]] (where not prohibited) and to promote [[tourist]] places but will usually require trailering to its operating site.

==Registration of converted and newly constructed vehicles==
{{Main|Vehicle registration}}

===United States===
The ease of registration will vary by state. Some states require safety inspections, usually to ensure body integrity in areas subject to severe corrosion from winter road de-icing materials. In any case, for general registration all functional safety equipment should be operating – turn signals, brake lights, headlights, horn, etc. The windshield should have no running cracks (small stone chips and "stars" may be acceptable if not in the driver's principal line of vision). If the vehicle has been reconstructed from a salvage vehicle (a vehicle whose registration has been forfeited) inspection may be more severe to ensure compliance and the legitimacy of sources of salvage components by presentation of proper purchase receipts.

Registration procedures will vary by state and will usually be more difficult (even bizarre) in states with strict emissions requirements (even though a plug-in only conversion will be a zero emission vehicle). Arguing with DMV staff is typically futile in all jurisdictions, but there may be appeal procedures available but whose availability may not be openly publicized.

On the other hand, changing the registration allows a conversion to qualify for tax incentives available in some states, such as Oregon, for either the vehicle, the charging system, or both.

====California (US) conversion registration and taxation====
&lt;!--HERE TEMP, TO BE MOVED TO WIKIBOOK--&gt;
Registration of a converted existing, or newly self-constructed electric vehicle in California is no longer difficult.

This falls into two categories; First, if the vehicle is built from new frame components and possibly some salvage parts, (''i.e.'', it has never been a previously titled motorcar previously, but it has brakes or axles that were obtained used/rebuilt.) In California if you "create" a car from scratch and want to register and title it with DMV, you need to go through the "Specially Constructed Vehicle Emission Control Program" or SPCNS for short, this is also called California "SB100" program. Or Second, a previously registered vehicle converted to electric propulsion.

SPCNC: In the past, the process of registering an SPCNS vehicle required meeting with an outside referee at a community college or one of the states mobile referee stations to verify the vehicle. The current process happens at the DMV with the inspection being done by A DMV inspector. The inspector will need to be able to see the motor and batteries and verify that there in no internal combustion engine. The vehicle will still need a brake and light inspection By an outside inspector to verify its compliance with other vehicle codes.

Currently Registered Vehicles: If you are converting an existing vehicle and it is older than 1975, you may opt to not bother to get the vehicle converted to the "E" code unless you are looking for the Diamond Lane stickers, since these vehicles don't require a smog inspection. For vehicles newer than 1975 you will need to go the DMV and have the vehicle inspected as a conversion. The batteries and motor will have to be exposed so the inspector can see them and verify that there is no internal combustion engine.

The next step requires the clerk at the local California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) office to call the Sacramento office. Only the Sacramento office can make this entry into the computer system. If the local clerk tries, the system will default to the "Q" code for hybrid. (These procedures are in place to inhibit fraudulent registration of ICE vehicles as Electric in order to avoid smog inspections.) A hybrid is not exempt from smog inspection. Before you leave the DMV make sure your printout has the proper "E" code or you will have to go back to do it again.

There is weight fee of $87 for vehicles under {{convert|6000|lb|abbr=on|sigfig=2|disp=flip}} or $266 for vehicles from {{convert|6000|to|10000|lb|abbr=on|sigfig=2|disp=flip}}. This is in addition to any regular registration fees.

A '''figurative palanquin''' connected with the [[totem]] of its owner is a special kind of [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]] used in the [[Greater Accra Region]] in [[Ghana]]. These [[Litter (vehicle)|palanquins]] called in the Ga language ''okadi akpakai'' belong to the royal insignias and are used only by the [[Ga people|Ga]] kings or ''mantsemei'' and their sub-chiefs when they are carried in public at durbars and festivals like ''Homowo''. With these figurative palanquins the Ga create ethnic differences between themselves and their Akan neighbours that only use simple boat- or chair-shaped litters.{{sfnp|Tschumi|2013|pages=60-73}}

== Significance ==
[[File:Drawing by Ataa Oko 2010.jpg|thumb|Figurative palanquin, drawing of Ataa Oko 2010]]
 
A Ga chief whose clan uses the lion as a totem must therefore use a litter in the form of a lion. The totems and family symbols of the Ga represent animals, plants or objects. All of them are associated with the history of the clan and his ancestors.

When a chief is carried in such a figurative palanquin, using his totem symbol ensures protection by the spirits and the ancestors which are connected with the respective symbol. At the same time the totem's magical powers are transferred to the chief who is sitting in the figurative palanquin. In contrast to the conventional boat- or chair-shaped Akan litters, the figurative palanquins of the Ga also function as marks of distinction between themselves and their Akan neighbours, and they even denote differences between the different Ga clans.{{sfnp|Tschumi|2013|pages=61-62}}

== History ==
In precolonial times, the Ga did not use litters, but carried their Chiefs on human shoulders. The [[ethnologist]] [[Margaret Joyce Field|Margaret Field]] believes that the boat-shaped Akan litters were introduced in Accra by the Akwamu living there since the 17th century. In the course of the 19th century, when the Ga took over from the Akwamu parts of their military organization, they also adopted the use of palanquins.{{sfnp|Field|1937|page=88}} However, there are no exact sources describing when the Ga started to use palanquins in the form of their family symbols. The social anthropologist [[Regula Tschumi]] found only a short notice in the Gold Coast Independent 1925 indicating that the King of Accra, the so-called ''Ga mantse'' used an elephant shaped palanquin in those years. According to Tschumi, the use of figurative palanquins spread in the course of the 20th century from Accra to other coastal towns where these palanquins, to some extent, are still used today.{{sfnp|Tschumi|2013|pages=64}}{{sfn|Tschumi, PhD|pages=125-144}}

== Users and manufacturers of figurative palanquins==
[[Image:Paa Joe mit Sandalettensarg 2006.jpeg|thumb|Paa Joe with a sandal coffin for the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern|Kunstmuseum, Bern]] 2006]] 
Unlike the Akan, the Ga use their palanquins only for secular sub-chiefs. Women and their highest spiritual leaders, the [[wulomei]], do not use palanquins for different reasons.

A palanquin is made new purposely for the [[enstoolment]] of a chief and is also used for the first time during his installation ceremony. After the installation the palanquin is kept as a [[royal insignia]] hidden away in the [[stool house]] of the respective family. It is not taken out again unless needed for an important occasion, such as the ''[[Homowo]]'' festival.

Accordingly, the figurative palanquins of the Ga are very rarely shown in public and especially for foreigners they are difficult to see. Therefore, it is not surprising that although the palanquins look similar to the [[fantasy coffin|figurative coffins]] which are well known to the western art market, the figurative palanquins remained completely unknown until recently.

These palanquins are also, contrary to what was believed formerly by many researchers and even many Ga, still used and built by the same craftsmen who make the figurative coffins. One of the most important palanquin builders of the last 30 years was [[Paa Joe]] who was known until now only for his figurative coffins. But as artisans are not supposed to talk about figurative palanquins and other royal insignias, Paa Joe is not giving out easily information about the palanquins he had formerly built.{{sfnp|Tschumi|2013|pages=62-64}}

== Figurative coffins as ritual copies of palanquins==
[[File:Ataa Oko, his third wife with a battleship coffin about 1960.jpg|thumb|[[Ataa Oko]] with a battleship coffin made around 1960]]
In the Ga culture, as Regula Tschumi has discovered during her fieldwork, initiations and funerals of the traditional chiefs must complement each other. Initiates must be buried in the same way as they were set up in office or initiated. Therefore, a chief who uses a figurative palanquin had and has to be buried in a coffin that looked the same as his previously used litter.{{sfnp|Tschumi|2013|page=65}} Contrary to what Thierry Secretan and others believed,{{sfnp|Secretan|1994|page= 14}} no king or chief was ever buried in his figurative palanquin, because litters belong to the royal insignia, which in the Ga culture may not be buried. Consequently, those chiefs who used a figurative palanquin at their installation ceremony had to be buried in a substitute, hence in a figurative coffin, that looked the same as their palanquin.

The first figurative coffins therefore were simply copies of the palanquins which were used as a substitute.

Though outwardly similar, figurative coffins and palanquins of course belong to a different category of objects: palanquins are royal insignia made to last and to be conserved in the family house after the death of their users, while the figurative [[coffin]]s may be sacrificed and are buried with the deceased. The figurative palanquin become sacred after the death of their users and the family keep them in order to maintain contact with the ancestors. For the royal families they also become distinguishing marks and function as tokens of legitimacy of their rule.{{sfnp|Tschumi|2013|pages=65-66}}{{sfn|Tschumi, PhD|pages=98-109, 144-147}}

== The Western art market==
[[File:Ataa Oko and Kudjo Affutu with Oko's red coq coffin 2009. Foto Regula Tschumi.JPG|thumb|Ataa Okos called his coffins and palanquins simply "coffin-akpakai" or "coffin-palanquin". He made no difference between figurative coffins and palanquins. On the photo: Ataa Oko with the artisan [[Kudjoe Affutu]], 2009]] 
While the figurative coffins of the Ga became world-famous on the Western art market, the figurative palanquins remain up to the present hidden and unknown as an art form. It was long believed that the Ga would no longer use figurative litters and the old palanquins no longer exist because as Thierry Secretan wrote, the Chiefs allegedly would have been buried in them.{{sfnp|Secretan|1994|page= 14}}

The fact that even many Ga still believe that their chiefs were formerly buried in figurative palanquins can, as Regula Tschumi writes it, be explained easily: Burials of initiates formerly involved human sacrifices and, to this day, neither uninitiated nor Christian Ga would want or be allowed to attend such funerals. Chiefs are also buried secretly, therefore it is and was difficult to say how a chief is buried when it occurs in the middle of the night. Hence, nobody outside the royal families noticed that their chiefs were interred in substitute palanquins.

As a chief had to be buried the same way as he had been installed in office, it was imperative to bury him in a coffin that was the copy of his palanquin. The first figurative coffins used to bury the traditional chiefs, were therefore not a new invented art form but only the copies of the figurative palanquins.{{sfnp|Tschumi|2013|pages=71-72}}{{sfn|Tschumi, PhD|pages=173-178}}

== Ataa Oko, Kane Kwei and other coffin makers ==
The Christians and common Ga began to use figurative coffins around 1950 to 1960. As they were not allowed to use family symbols, which were still reserved for their traditional chiefs, carpenters such as [[Ataa Oko]] (1919-2012), [[Seth Kane Kwei|Kane Kwei]] (1925-1992) and [[Fantasy coffin|others]] began to produce figurative coffins avoiding the traditional totem symbols. They built coffins which did not represent forms with a deeper significance, but rather objects which were  associated with the deceased’s occupation.

Today all the Ga, irrespective of their religious affiliation, use figurative coffins which were formerly reserved for the traditional kings, chiefs and priests. So these coffins are now used by the broader mass of Ga people.

Since the 1970s, such coffins have been recognized by the Western art world as works of art in the Western sense. The exhibition “Les Magiciens de la terre” 1989 and the theories of Thierry Secretan{{sfnp|Secretan|1994}} caused the Teshie carpenter Kane Kwei to be acclaimed as the inventor of [[Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop|figurative coffins]] and only his products to be classified as works of art. Through lack of knowledge, the Western art world erroneously attributed the invention of a supposedly new art form to a single artist and made him and the figurative coffins world-famous, while the significance of the already existing figurative palanquins remained until recently completely unknown. Therefore, in the West the figurative coffins acquired high artistic status which in fact would have belonged to the Ga original art form, the figurative palanquins.{{sfnp|Tschumi|2013|pages=71-72}}{{sfn|Tschumi, PhD|pages=173-178}}

== Exhibitions ==
In March 2017 the Gallery ANO in Accra showed for the first time a palanquin in the exhibition "Accra: Portraits of A City". The palanquin had been made by [[Kudjoe Affutu]] in 2013 for a chief in the Central Region, Ghana.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22729">The '''finite point method''' ('''FPM''') is a [[Meshfree methods|meshfree method]] for solving [[partial differential equation]]s (PDEs) on scattered distributions of points. The FPM was proposed in the mid-nineties in (Oñate, Idelsohn, Zienkiewicz &amp; Taylor, 1996a),&lt;ref name="Onate1996a"/&gt; (Oñate, Idelsohn, Zienkiewicz, Taylor &amp; Sacco, 1996b)&lt;ref name="Onate1996b"/&gt; and (Oñate &amp; Idelsohn, 1998a)&lt;ref name="Onate1998a"/&gt; with the purpose to facilitate the solution of problems involving complex geometries, free surfaces, moving boundaries and [[Adaptive mesh refinement|adaptive refinement]]. Since then, the FPM has evolved considerably, showing satisfactory accuracy and capabilities to deal with different fluid and solid mechanics problems.

==History==
Similar to other meshfree methods for PDEs, the finite point method (FPM) has its origins in techniques developed for scattered data fitting and interpolation, basically in the line of [[Least squares#Weighted least squares|weighted least-squares]] methods (WLSQ). The latter can be regarded as particular forms of the [[Moving least squares|moving least-squares]] method (MLS) proposed by Lancaster and Salkauskas.&lt;ref name="Lancaster1981"/&gt; WLSQ methods have been widely used in meshfree techniques because allow retaining most of the MLS, but are more efficient and simple to implement. With these goals in mind, an outstanding investigation which led to the development of the FPM began in (Oñate, Idelsohn &amp; Zienkiewicz, 1995a)&lt;ref name="Onate1995a"/&gt; and (Taylor, Zienkiewicz, Oñate &amp; Idelsohn, 1995).&lt;ref name="Taylor1995"/&gt; The technique proposed was characterized by WLSQ approximations on local clouds of points and an equations discretization procedure based on point collocation (in the line of Batina’s works, 1989,&lt;ref name="Batina1989"/&gt; 1992&lt;ref name="Batina1992"/&gt;). The first applications of the FPM focused on adaptive compressible flow problems (Fischer, Onate &amp; Idelsohn, 1995;&lt;ref name="Fischer1995"/&gt; Oñate, Idelsohn &amp; Zienkiewicz, 1995a;&lt;ref name="Onate1995a"/&gt; Oñate, Idelsohn, Zienkiewicz &amp; Fisher, 1995b&lt;ref name="Onate1995b"/&gt;). The effects on the approximation of the local clouds and weighting functions were also analyzed using linear and quadratic polynomial bases (Fischer, 1996).&lt;ref name="Fischer1996"/&gt; Additional studies in the context of convection-diffusion and incompressible flow problems gave the FPM a more solid base; cf. (Oñate, Idelsohn, Zienkiewicz &amp; Taylor, 1996a)&lt;ref name="Onate1996a"/&gt; and (Oñate, Idelsohn, Zienkiewicz, Taylor &amp; Sacco, 1996b).&lt;ref name="Onate1996b"/&gt; These works and (Oñate &amp; Idelsohn, 1998)&lt;ref name="Onate1998a"/&gt; defined the basic FPM technique in use today.

==Numerical approximation==
[[File:FPM numerical approximation scheme.tif|thumb|FPM numerical approximation scheme]]
The approximation in the FPM can be summarized as follows. For each point &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; in the analysis domain &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; (''star point''), an approximated solution is locally constructed by using a subset of surrounding supporting points &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt;, which belong to the problem domain (''local cloud of points'' &lt;math&gt;\Omega_i&lt;/math&gt;). The approximation is computed as a linear combination of the cloud unknown nodal values (or parameters) and certain metric coefficients. These are obtained by solving a WLSQ problem at the cloud level, in which the distances between the nodal parameters and the approximated solution are minimized in a LSQ sense. Once the approximation metric coefficients are known, the problem governing PDEs are sampled at each ''star point'' by using a [[collocation method]]. The continuous variables (and their derivatives) are replaced in the sampled equations by the discrete approximated forms, and the solution of the resulting system allows calculating the unknown nodal values. Hence, the approximated solution satisfying the governing equations of the problem can be obtained. It is important to note that the highly local character of the FPM makes the method suitable for implementing efficient parallel solution schemes.

The construction of the typical FPM approximation is described in (Oñate &amp; Idelsohn, 1998).&lt;ref name="Onate1998a"/&gt; An analysis of the approximation parameters can be found in (Ortega, Oñate &amp; Idelsohn, 2007)&lt;ref name="Ortega2007"/&gt; and a more comprehensive study is conducted in (Ortega, 2014).&lt;ref name="Ortega2014"/&gt; Other approaches have also been proposed, see for instance (Boroomand, Tabatabaei and Oñate, 2005).&lt;ref name="Boroomand2005"/&gt; An extension of the FPM approximation is presented in (Boroomand, Najjar &amp; Oñate, 2009).&lt;ref name="Boroomand2009"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Fluid mechanics===
The early lines of research and applications of the FPM to fluid flow problems are summarized in (Fischer, 1996).&lt;ref name="Fischer1996"/&gt; There, convective-diffusive problems were studied using LSQ and WLSQ polynomial approximations. The study focused on the effects of the cloud of points and weighting functions on the accuracy of the local approximation, which helped to understand the basic behavior of the FPM. The results showed that the 1D FPM approximation leads to discrete derivative forms similar to those obtained with central difference approximations, which are second-order accurate. However, the accuracy degrades to first-order for non-symmetric clouds, depending on the weighting function. Preliminary criteria about the selection of points conforming the local clouds were also defined with the aim to improve the ill-conditioning of the minimization problem. The flow solver employed in that work was based on a two-step Taylor-Galerkin scheme with explicit artificial dissipation. The numerical examples involved inviscid subsonic, transonic and supersonic two-dimensional problems, but a viscous low-Reynolds number test case was also provided. In general, the results obtained in this work were satisfactory and demonstrated that the introduction of weighting in the LSQ minimization leads to superior results (linear basis were used).

In a similar line of research, a residual stabilization technique derived in terms of flux balancing in a finite domain, known as Finite Increment Calculus (FIC) (Oñate, 1996,&lt;ref name="Onate1996"/&gt; 1998&lt;ref name="Onate1998b"/&gt;), was introduced. The results were comparable to those obtained with explicit artificial dissipation, but with the advantage that the stabilization in FIC is introduced in a consistent manner, see (Oñate, Idelsohn, Zienkiewicz, Taylor &amp; Sacco, 1996b)&lt;ref name="Onate1996b"/&gt; and (Oñate &amp; Idelsohn, 1998a).&lt;ref name="Onate1998a"/&gt;

Among these developments, the issue of point generation was firstly addressed in (Löhner &amp; Oñate, 1998).&lt;ref name="Lohner1998"/&gt; Based on an advancing front technique, the authors showed that point discretizations suitable for meshless computations can be generated more efficiently by avoiding the usual quality checks needed in conventional mesh generation. Highly competitive generation times were achieved in comparison with traditional meshers, showing for the first time that meshless methods are a feasible alternative to alleviate discretization problems.

Incompressible 2D flows were first studied in (Oñate, Sacco &amp; Idelsohn, 2000)&lt;ref name="Onate2000"/&gt; using a [[Projection method (fluid dynamics)|projection method]] stabilized through the FIC technique. A detailed analysis of this approach was carried out in (Sacco, 2002).&lt;ref name="Sacco2002"/&gt; Outstanding achievements from that work have given the FPM a more solid base; among them, the definition of local and normalized approximation bases, a procedure for constructing local clouds of points based on local Delaunay triangulation, and a criterion for evaluating the quality of the resultant approximation. The numerical applications presented focused mainly on two-dimensional (viscous and inviscid) incompressible flows, but a three-dimensional application example was also provided.

A preliminary application of the FPM in a Lagrangian framework, presented in (Idelsohn, Storti &amp; Oñate, 2001),&lt;ref name="Idelsohn2001"/&gt; is also worth of mention. Despite the interesting results obtained for incompressible [[free surface]] flows, this line of research was not continued under the FPM and later formulations were exclusively based on Eulerian flow descriptions.

The first application of the FPM to the solution of 3D compressible flows was presented in a pioneer work by (Löhner, Sacco, Oñate &amp; Idelsohn, 2002).&lt;ref name="Lohner2002"/&gt; There, a reliable and general procedure for constructing local clouds of points (based on a Delaunay technique) and a well-suited scheme for solving the flow equations were developed. In the solution scheme proposed, the discrete flux derivatives are written along edges connecting the cloud's points as a central difference-like expression plus an upwind biased term that provides convective stabilization. An approximate Riemann solver of Roe and van Leer flux vector splitting were used for this purpose. The approach proposed is more accurate (also more expensive) than artificial dissipation methods and, additionally, does not require the definition of geometrical measures in the local cloud and problem dependent parameters. The time integration of the equations was performed through a multi-stage explicit scheme in the line of Runge-Kutta methods.

Some years later, further research was carried out in relation to 3D FPM approximations in (Ortega, Oñate &amp; Idelsohn, 2007).&lt;ref name="Ortega2007"/&gt; This work focused on constructing robust approximations regardless of the characteristics of the local support. To this end, local automatic adjusting of the weighting function and other approximation parameters were proposed. Further 3D applications of the method involved compressible aerodynamics flows with [[Adaptive mesh refinement|adaptive refinement]] (Ortega, Oñate &amp; Idelsohn, 2009)&lt;ref name="Ortega2009"/&gt; and [[moving/deforming boundary]] problems (Ortega, Oñate &amp; Idelsohn, 2013).&lt;ref name="Ortega2013"/&gt; In these works, the FPM showed satisfactory robustness and accuracy, and capabilities to address practical computations. Among other achievements, it was demonstrated that a complete regeneration of the model discretization could be an affordable solution strategy, even in large simulation problems. This result presents new possibilities for the meshless analysis of moving/deforming domain problems. The FPM was also applied with success to adaptive [[Shallow water equations|shallow water]] problems in (Ortega, Oñate, Idelsohn &amp; Buachart, 2011)&lt;ref name="Ortega2011"/&gt; and (Buachart, Kanok-Nukulchai, Ortega &amp; Oñate, 2014).&lt;ref name="Buachart2014"/&gt; A proposal to exploit meshless advantages in high-Reynolds viscous flow problems is presented in (Ortega, Oñate, Idelsohn &amp; Flores, 2014a).&lt;ref name="Ortega2014a"/&gt;

In the same field of applications, a major study on the accuracy, computational cost and parallel performance of the FPM was carried out in (Ortega, Oñate, Idelsohn &amp; Flores, 2014b).&lt;ref name="Ortega2014b"/&gt; There, the FPM was compared with an equivalent Finite Element-based solver, which provided a standard for assessing both, the characteristics of the meshless solver and its suitability to address practical applications. Some simplifications of the FPM technique were proposed in this work to improve efficiency and reduce the performance gap with FEM. Then, grid convergence studies using a wing-body configuration were conducted. The results showed comparable accuracy and performance, revealing the FPM competitive with respect to its FEM counterpart. This is important because meshless techniques are often considered impractical due to the poor efficiency of the initial implementations.

The FPM has also been applied in [[aeroacoustics]] in (Bajko, Cermak &amp; Jicha, 2014).&lt;ref name="Bajko2014"/&gt; The solution scheme proposed is based on a linearized Riemann solver and successfully exploits the advantages of high-order FPM approximations. The results obtained are indicative of the potential of the FPM to address sound propagation problems.

===Solid mechanics===

==Current lines of investigation==
Current efforts are mainly oriented to exploit the capabilities of the FPM to work in parallel environments for solving large-scale practical problems, particularly in areas where meshless procedures can make useful contributions, for example problems involving complex geometry, moving/deforming domain, adaptive refinement and [[Multiscale modeling|multiscale]] phenomena.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="884">A '''flood gun''' is an electromechanical device that provides a steady flow of low-energy [[electron]]s to a desired target or "flood area." 

Typically, the target is an area on an [[Insulator_(electrical)|insulator]] or [[semiconductor]] where another "writing gun" has just left a net positive charge. 

If the energy of a flood gun's electrons is properly balanced, each impinging flood gun electron knocks out one secondary electron from the target, thus preserving the net charge in the target area.  This is called "charge neutralization."

Flood guns are typically used in [[photoelectron spectroscopy]], [[oscilloscopes]] and [[Ion implantation|ion beam implanters]] as their secondary [[electron gun]].

The '''Ford Transit''' is a range of [[light commercial vehicle]]s produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] since 1965. Sold primarily as a [[panel van|cargo van]], the Transit is also built as a passenger van (marketed as the '''Ford Tourneo''' since 1995), [[minibus]], [[cutaway van chassis]], and as a [[pickup truck]]. Over 8,000,000 Transit vans have been sold, making it the third best-selling van of all time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 20 best-selling vans of all time |url=http://parkers.co.uk/vans/news-and-advice/2015/august/top-20-best-selling-vans-of-all-time/ |work=Parkers Van News |publisher=Bauer Media |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been produced across four basic platform generations (debuting in 1965, 1986, 2000, and 2013 respectively), with various "facelift" versions of each.

The first product of the merged [[Ford of Europe]], the Transit was marketed through Western Europe and Australia; by the end of the twentieth century, it was marketed nearly globally with the exception of North America until 2013 when it replaced the [[Ford E-Series]] in 2015. The Transit has been the best-selling light commercial vehicle in Europe for forty years, and in some countries the term "Transit" has passed into common usage as a [[generic trademark]] applying to any light commercial van in the Transit's size bracket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/transit |title=Meaning of "transit" in the English Dictionary |website=Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="topgear"/&gt; While initially designed for the European market, the Ford Transit is now produced in Asia, North America, and Europe for worldwide buyers. Upon production in North America, the Transit won second place in [[Motor Trend]]'s 2015 '[[Truck of the Year]]' award, behind the newly introduced mid-size [[Chevrolet Colorado]] pickup and ahead of the new [[Ford F-150]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Welch |first=David |date=3 December 2014 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-03/ford-s-new-f-150-loses-truck-of-year-award-to-chevy |title=Ford’s New F-150 Loses Truck of Year Award to Chevy |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, the Transit is the best-selling van of any type in the United States, minivan sales included. The Transit drives Ford's 57&amp;nbsp;percent share of the [[full-size van]] market in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cain |first=Timothy |date=29 April 2016 |url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2016/04/ford-transit-americas-best-selling-van-minivans-included/ |title=Ford Transit Is America’s Best-Selling Van, Minivans Included |work=[[The Truth About Cars]] |accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the British-built Transit "family", the first production Ford to wear the "Transit" badge was a van built in Ford's Köln ([[Cologne]]) plant in Germany. It was introduced in 1953 as '''FK 1000''' carrying 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg) with a 1.3-litre [[inline-four engine]] from the contemporary Taunus. In 1955 the engine capacity was enlarged to 1.5 litres. From 1961, this vehicle was called the '''Ford Taunus Transit'''. Production of this model ceased in 1965.

=== Naming system ===
The German vehicle was not widely exported, and the "Mark 1" tag has commonly been applied, retrospectively, to the 1965 to 1978 British model (see below). Whilst there have only been four basic platforms since 1965, the various facelifts and upgrades over the years have been referred to using a conflicting range of "Mark" numbers, with some sources counting a facelift as a new "Mark", some not. Ford's own historical look back at Transit production, published for the launch of the 1994 model, avoids the issue by referring to generations of Transit by years produced.&lt;ref&gt;"Van World" marketing periodical; in article "1965–1995: 30 years and 3,000,000 Transits later"; pub. Ford Motor Company Ltd., Brentwood, UK; Autumn 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; This article attempts to make mention of all the common naming systems.

The first generation Transit, or the '''Transit Mark I''' in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="mk_1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ford Transit van club signs 1,000th member |url=http://www.ford.co.uk/experience-ford/AboutFord/News/VehicleNews/2012/Transit-Club-1000th-Member |publisher=Ford UK |accessdate=14 August 2013 |date=23 April 2012 |quote=Darren, whose 1986 Mk II long wheelbase Transit is in daily use [...] was delighted to find himself a milestone member: [...] "The Transit has been part of my life since I first started driving one in 1996, and now I have bought a second classic model, a 1969 Mk I camper van, as a restoration project."}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced in October 1965, taking over directly from the [[Ford Thames 400E|Thames 400E]].

The van was produced initially at Ford's [[Langley, Slough|Langley]] facility in Berkshire, England (a former Second World War aircraft factory which had produced [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters), but demand outstripped the capability of the plant, and production was moved to [[Ford Southampton plant|Southampton]] until closure in 2013 in favour of the Turkish factory.&lt;ref name=BBC23432322&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-23432322 |title=Last shift at Ford's Transit van factory in Swaythling |publisher=BBC |date=26 July 2013 |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transits were also produced in Ford's [[Genk]] factory in Belgium and also Turkey. Transits were produced in Amsterdam for the local market from the mid-1970s until the end of 1981. This factory had ample capacity, since the [[Ford Transcontinental]] produced there had little success (total production 8000 in 6 years). Although the Transit sold well in the Netherlands, it was not enough to save the factory, which closed in December 1981.

The Transit was introduced to replace the [[Ford Thames 400E]], a small mid-engined [[forward control]] van noted for its narrow track which was in competition with similar-looking but larger vehicles from the [[Morris Commercial J4|BMC J4]] and [[Morris Commercial J2|J2]] vans and [[Rootes Group]]'s [[Commer]] PB ranges. In a UK market segment then dominated by the [[Bedford CA]], Ford's Thames competitor, because of its restricted load area, failed to attract fleet users in sufficient numbers. Ford switched to a front-engined configuration, as did the 1950s by Bedford with their well-regarded CA series vans. [[Henry Ford II]]'s revolutionary step was to combine the engineering efforts of [[Ford of Britain]] and Ford of Germany to create a prototype for the Ford of Europe of today—previously the two subsidiaries had avoided competing in one another's domestic markets but had been direct competitors in other European markets.

The Transit was a departure from the European commercial vehicles of the day with its American-inspired styling—its broad track gave it a huge advantage in carrying capacity over comparable vehicles of the day. Most of the Transit's mechanical components were adapted from Ford's car range of the time. Another key to the Transit's success was the sheer number of different body styles: panel vans in long and short wheelbase forms, pick-up truck, minibuses, crew-cabs to name but a few.

The engines used in the UK were the [[Ford Essex V4 engine|Essex V4]] for the [[petrol]]-engined version in 1.7&amp;nbsp;L and 2.0&amp;nbsp;L capacities. By using relatively short V-4 engines Ford were able to minimise the additional length necessitated to place the engine ahead of the driver.&lt;ref name=Autocar196804&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Autocar |volume=128 |issue=3766) |author=Maurice A Smith (Ed) |title=The [Ford] Light Commercials |page=105 |date=18 April 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular development under the bonnet was the equipping of the van with an [[Alternator (auto)|alternator]] at time when the UK market competitors expected buyers to be content with a [[dynamo]].&lt;ref name=Autocar196804/&gt; A 43&amp;nbsp;bhp (32&amp;nbsp;kW) [[diesel engine]] sourced from [[Perkins Engines Company Limited|Perkins]] was also offered. As this engine was too long to fit under the Transit's stubby nose, the diesel version featured a longer bonnet. The underpowered Perkins proved unpopular, and was replaced by Ford's own "[[Ford York engine|York]]" unit in 1972. For mainland Europe the Transit had the German [[Ford Taunus V4 engine]] in Cologne 1.3, 1.5, and 1.7- or Essex 2.0-litre versions. The diesel version's long nose front was also used to accommodate the Ford 3.0 L [[Ford Essex V6 engine (UK)]] for high performance applications such as vans supplied to police and ambulance services. In Australia, in 1973, to supplement the two Essex V4 engines that were available the Transit was released with the long-nose diesel front used to accommodate an [[Straight-six engine|inline 6-cylinder]] engine derived from the [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]].

The [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] reported on this vehicle in 1972 via a [[Scotland Yard]] spokesman that 'Ford Transits are used in 95 per cent of [[Bank robbery|bank raids]]. With the performance of a car, and space for 1.75 tonnes of loot, the Transit is proving to be the perfect getaway vehicle...', describing it as 'Britain's most wanted van'.&lt;ref name="topgear"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Series 06, Episode 07 |series=Top Gear |serieslink=Top Gear (2002 TV series) |network=BBC |airdate=10 July 2005 |seriesno=6 |number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/Europe/gb/2015/07/Transit%2050%20Wonderful%20Facts%204.pdf|title=Ford Transit: 50 Wonderful Facts|last=|first=|date=July 2015|website=Ford Motor Company|access-date=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.topgear.com/car-news/british/ford-transit-50-today-so-we-drove-oldest-surviving-example|title=The Ford Transit is 50 today, so we drove the oldest surviving example|last=|first=|date=9 October 2015|website=www.topgear.com|language=en|access-date=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of a front beam axle in place of a system incorporating independent front suspension that had featured on its [[Ford Thames 400E|UK predecessor]] might have been seen as a backward step by some, but on the road commentators felt that the Transit's wider track and longer wheelbase more than compensated for the apparent step backwards represented by Ford's suspension choices.&lt;ref name=Autocar196804/&gt; Drivers appreciated the elimination of the excessive noise, smell and cabin heat that resulted from placing the driver above or adjacent to the engine compartment in the Thames 400E and other forward control light vans of the 1950s and early 1960s.&lt;ref name=Autocar196804/&gt;

The Transit was also assembled in [[South Africa]] between 1967 and 1974, the last Transit to be sold in that country until 2013, when a fully imported model was introduced.&lt;ref name="Wheels24"&gt;[http://www.wheels24.co.za/News/Ford-Transit-Long-wait-worth-it-20130424 Ford Transit: Long wait worth it], [[News24|Wheels24]], 25 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1978 Ford Transit van, ice cream van conversion (22381174286).jpg|thumb|left| Ford Transit [[Ice cream van]] with the restyled longer bonnet]]

In August 1977, a facelifted version—codenamed within Ford as the "Transit {{frac|1978|1|2}}"—but usually referred to as the '''Transit Mark II''',&lt;ref name="mk_1"/&gt; debuted with a restyled nose section, new interior, and the introduction of the [[Ford Pinto engine|Pinto]] engine from the [[Ford Cortina|Cortina]] in place of the Essex V4. Many fleet owners experienced premature camshaft wear in early Pinto units in the Cortina and for two years the Transit 75 was available with the 1.6&amp;nbsp;L Ford Kent cross-flow engine. High-performance versions intended for police or ambulance use used the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[V6]] version of the [[Ford Essex V6 engine (UK)|Essex engine]], Australian variants had 4.1&amp;nbsp;L (250&amp;nbsp;cu in) [[Straight-six engine|inline 6-cylinder]] engines.

In 1984, the York diesel engine was redesigned into the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L "DI" (direct injection) unit. At this time this generation received a minor facelift including a grey plastic front grille with integrated headlamp surrounds, wraparound indicators, longer bumper end caps and multifunction rear lights incorporating fog, indicator, reversing and side lights for the panel van. This facelift did not commonly result in a new "Mark" number.

The Mark II was available in 6 body styles: Van, Kombi, Chassis Cab, Parcel Van, Bus and Crewbus all available in short-wheelbase (2690&amp;nbsp;mm) and long-wheelbase (3000&amp;nbsp;mm) versions. A selection of 5 engines was available: 1.6-litre OHC Petrol, 1.6-litre OHV Petrol (Kent), 2.0-litre OHC Petrol, 2.0-litre OHC Petrol (Economy) and 2.5-litre Diesel. On top of this were 32 door combinations, 6 axle ratios and options for 12 – 17 interior seats. All of these were available in any combination when purchased with Ford's highly customizable custom plan. At the time this gave the business sector an unprecedented amount of flexibility, which was a major factor in the vehicles' ultimate success.&lt;ref&gt;"The New Ford Transit – Confidential for Ford Salesmen Only (Mark II)."{{Clarify|reason=Clarify reference using Citation Style 1 templates|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, for mainland European market only, the Transit Clubmobil was introduced by the Hymer company. This was fitted with a 1.6 / 2.0 OHC engine, and featured a custom interior – captain style swivel seats in velour, pile carpet, motorsport steering wheel, unique Ronal 14" alloy wheels, unique side windows, folding back seat, luggage box, unique front spoiler, tinted glass, power assisted steering, spare wheel carrier and rear door ladder. In 3 years of production 150 were produced and less than 20 are thought to still exist.

In late 1982 a four-wheel drive version was added to the German market. This was developed together with a Ford dealer in [[Stuttgart]].&lt;ref name="Truck9.82"&gt;{{ cite journal | journal = TRUCK | date = September 1982 | ref = truck982 | page = 25 | editor-last = Kennett | editor-first = Pat | title = Intertruck: Germany | last = Kacher | first = Georg | location = London, UK | publisher = FF Publishing Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 4x4 Transit was later offered in other markets as well.

=== Pre-facelift (1986–1995) ===
[[File:Blue Ford Transit Mk4 Jasło.JPG|thumb|left|Pre facelift Ford Transit rear]]

Codenamed ''VE6'', the third generation Transit platform appeared in January 1986 and was notable for its all-new bodyshell which was of "one-box" design (''i.e.'' the windscreen and bonnet are at close to the same angle), and the front suspension was changed to a fully independent configuration on SWB versions. The engine range was carried over largely unchanged from the last of the 1978–1985 generation models, although in 1989 the high-performance 3.0 Essex [[V6]] petrol was replaced by the Cologne 2.9 EFI V6, mainly because of emissions regulations as the Essex V6 design was nearly 25 years old by then and still used a carburettor. The third generation Transit was developed under the "Triton" code name.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | journal = TRUCK | date = September 1982 | ref = truck982 | page = 37 | editor-last = Kennett | editor-first = Pat | title = The Great European Retreat | first = Alan | last = Walker | location = London, UK | publisher = FF Publishing Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A subtle facelift in 1992 saw the fully independent front suspension adopted across the range, whilst a redesigned floor plan allowed the use of single, rather than paired, rear wheels on the LWB derivative, further increasing payload—these models are identifiable by the slightly more rounded front headlamps. In Australia, the third generation Transit did not go on sale until March 1994, after a 13-year absence from that market.

=== Facelift (1995–2003) ===
[[File:Ford transit 5 v sst.jpg|thumb|left|1989–1995 Ford Transit (first facelift)]]
[[File:Ford transit 6 v sst.jpg|thumb|left|1995–2003 Ford Transit (second facelift)]]

A major facelift to the Transit in 1994 gave the Transit a new nose and [[dashboard]], along with the [[Ford I4 DOHC engine|2.0&amp;nbsp;L DOHC 8-valve]] engine as found in the 1993 to 1998 Ford Scorpio. It is similar to the earlier Sierra DOHC unit but without the distributor and uses the updated [[OBD II]]-compliant EEC-V level [[engine control unit]]. Some of Ford's 16-valve engines, such as those found in the [[Ford Scorpio|Scorpio]], [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Escort RS2000]] and [[Ford Galaxy|Galaxy]] were also based on this block. At the same time [[air conditioning]], electric windows, central locking, electric mirrors and airbags were all made available as optional extras.

The turbo diesel version came in {{convert|85|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|100|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|115|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} version with an electronic fuel pump.

For the 30th anniversary of the Transit in 1995 Ford released a limited edition model called the Transit Hallmark. Six hundred were made and were available in three colours with 200 being made in each.

In Europe the VE83 Transit was available up to 2000, but in Vietnam it was built up to 2003 when it was exchanged in June for the new generation.&lt;ref name="Ford: Facilities"/&gt;

Developed by Ford in the United States, the main innovation is that it is available in either front- or rear-wheel drive. Ford nomenclature makes this the V184 ([[rear-wheel-drive]]) or V185 ([[front-wheel-drive]]) model. This model features the "Puma"-type [[Ford Duratorq|Duratorq]] turbo diesel engine also used in the 2000 [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]] and [[Jaguar X-Type]], with the petrol versions moving up to the 2.3&amp;nbsp;L 16-Valve edition of the [[straight-4]] engine. With this engine, the Transit can reach {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 21 seconds and reach a top speed of {{convert|93|mph|km/h}}, returning it to car-like performance as claimed for the earliest models. A demonstration of this model's speed was shown on ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'' in 2005, where German race driver [[Sabine Schmitz]] attempted to drive it around the [[Nürburgring]] in under ten minutes, matching Jeremy Clarkson's time in a turbodiesel Jaguar S-Type; she was unsuccessful, marking her fastest lap at 10m 8s.

This version won the [[International Van of the Year]] 2001.

[[File:Ford Transit rear 20071231.jpg|left|thumbnail|Ford Transit pre-facelift]]

The [[Durashift]] EST [[automatic transmission]] (optional on all rear-wheel-drive models) features controls mounted on the dashboard, a specially adapted manual mode, tow-haul mode, economy mode and winter mode. This is known as the ASM (automatically-shifting manual) system in the Australian market.

2002 saw the introduction of the first [[Common rail|High Pressure Common Rail]] diesel engine in the Transit, with the launch of the {{convert|125|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} HPCR 2.0-litre in the FWD. Production of the van started at the new Ford-Otosan plant in Kocaeli, Turkey which saw the end of all production at the Genk, Belgium plant which had been producing Transits since 1965. This coincided with the introduction of the [[Ford Transit Connect|Transit Connect]] (also produced in Kocaeli), a smaller panel van based on the [[Ford C170 platform|C170]] (Focus) platform and aimed at replacing the older [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Escort]] and [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]] based models. Despite the name, the Connect has no engineering commonality with the full-size Transit.

2003 saw a new instrument cluster with a digital odometer.

2004 saw the launch of the first RWD HPCR, the {{convert|135|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.4-litre variant that also introduced the 6-speed MT-82 RWD [[manual gearbox]].

The five millionth Transit rolled off the Southampton line on Monday, 18 July 2005 and was donated to an English charity.

The fourth generation Transit, received a facelift to the body, introduced in August 2006, including new front and rear lights, a new front end and a new interior featuring the [[gearstick]] on the dashboard and Ford's new corporate radio design. Besides the styling changes, the powertrains were revised. The old petrol engine was replaced with one from the [[Ford Ranger]], the front-wheel-drive diesel went from 2.0 to 2.2 litres capacity, and all diesel engines gained high-pressure common rail ([[TDCi]]) systems. The powertrains were changed to meet new emissions legislation. Additionally, the facelift introduced [[CAN bus]] electronics to the Transit for the first time. The new version (Ford nomenclature V347 for front-wheel drive and V348 for rear-wheel drive) won [[International Van of the Year]] for 2007 despite tough competition from several all-new rivals. This Transit arrived in Mexico to replace the [[Ford Freestar|Freestar]] after the 2007 model year. This was the first Transit having a [[Straight-five engine|five-cylinder engine]].

Mid-2006 saw the launch of the "Sport Van", a production van featuring the {{convert|130|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine with additional styling parts, "Le Mans" stripes and 18-inch alloy wheels.

Late-2007 saw the launch of the {{convert|140|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine for front wheel drives (replacing the 130 PS) complete with the VMT6 6-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] transaxle to cope with the extra power.

The 6-speed transaxle was introduced on the mid-power FWD in late 2008 when the {{convert|110|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine was upped to {{convert|115|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

In late 2008, the "coated Diesel Particulate Filter" (cDPF)—designed to meet higher emission standards than the current Euro IV requirement—was introduced as an option on all diesel engines. Production ended in 2013, but returned in China in two modified forms.

===XXL===
To celebrate the Transit's status as International Van of the Year 2007, Ford built a [[stretch limousine]] style van — the Transit XXL. It is a unique special that is the most  expensive Transit ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ford Transit |url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-reviews/16759/ford-transit |accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SuperSportVan ===
The Ford Transit SuperSportVan is a one-off, high-performance version of the fifth-gen Transit built by Ford Europe. It uses a 3.2L turbocharged [[DuraTorq TDCi|Duratorq]] I5, producing 198 horsepower, borrowed from a larger Transit model, mated to a 6-speed transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ford U.K. Builds Transit SuperSportVan, Makes Us Want the Big Transit More |url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/ford-u-k-builds-transit-supersportvan-makes-us-want-the-big-transit-more |website=Car and Driver |accessdate=29 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

[[File:2014 Ford Transit (VO) 350E van (2015-06-03) 02.jpg|thumb|left|Ford Transit 350E van]]

The fifth generation of the Transit was officially launched in January 2013 at the [[North American International Auto Show]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2015 Ford Transit |url=http://www.freep.com/article/20130117/BUSINESS03/301170102/2014-Ford-Transit |work=Detroit Free Press |accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Detroit]].

A OneFord globally developed vehicle, the new-generation Transit was designed by [[Ford of Europe]] and co-developed with Ford in North America. In a break from the previous generation of the Transit, there are two distinct body forms:

*'''Mid-size front wheel drive:''' now a distinct model, branded [[Ford Transit Custom|'''Transit/Tourneo Custom''']]. It is intended to compete with vehicles such as the [[Mercedes-Benz Vito|Mercedes-Benz Vito/Viano]] and [[Volkswagen Transporter (T5)|Volkswagen Transporter T5]].
*'''Full size rear wheel drive:''' a full size version, to enable Transit to better replace the outgoing twenty-year-old [[Ford E-Series|Econoline/E-Series]] in the North American market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/transit/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802102427/http://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/transit/ |archivedate=2 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the front-wheel drive V347 Transit was sold alongside the E-Series in Mexico starting in 2007 (replacing the Freestar minivan), this generation of the Transit is the first to be officially sold in the United States and Canada. As part of the development cycle, Ford loaned examples of the previous-generation (V347/348) Transit to high-mileage drivers in the United States for evaluation purposes and durability testing.

Both versions external design look evolved from the New Edge styling used from the previous-generation model to the ''[[Kinetic Design|Kinetic]]'' design adopted by the OneFord global models since 2010; the interior drew cues from the third generation [[Ford Focus (third generation)|Ford Focus]].

=== Model configuration ===
The new Transit is available in cargo van and chassis/cutaway cab configurations. In a significant departure from the E-Series, but standard for existing rest of world versions, Transit vans/wagons come in three different roof heights; extended-wheelbase vans are available with dual rear wheels. It was released in North America in the summer of 2014, released as a 2015 model. As with the much smaller Transit Connect, passenger versions are marketed under a singular Transit nameplate rather than the Tourneo name seen globally.

Outside of North America, much of the Transit engine lineup and drivetrain configurations are retained from the previous generation. For the United States and Canada, the four cylinder engines and manual transmission are not offered; in these markets only the 180-hp 3.2L Duratorq I5 diesel (branded as a PowerStroke) is shared with global-market models. For North America, the standard engine is a 275-hp 3.7L [[Ford Cyclone engine#Duratec 37|Ti-VCT]] V6 (shared with the [[Ford F series|F-Series]] and Police Interceptor version of the Ford Explorer) and an optional 320-hp 3.5L [[Ford Ecoboost engine#3.5 L EcoBoost V6|EcoBoost]] V6 shared with the F-150 and D3-platform vehicles. All versions in North America are specified with a 6-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drivetrain. The 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 can be converted to run on [[compressed natural gas]] or [[liquefied petroleum gas]] with an optional Gaseous Engine Prep Package.&lt;ref name=US_Transit_Alt_Fuel&gt;{{cite web |title=2014 Transit: Alternative Fuel Capability |url=http://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/transit/2014/features/#page=Feature13 |publisher=Ford Motor Company |accessdate=1 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603022724/http://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/transit/2014/features/#page=Feature13 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, 4x4 conversions are done through factory-supported third party installers.

Each Transit model saw at least at a 600 lb. increase in maximum payload capability over the comparable E-Series/Econoline model it replaced. The Transit's body makes extensive use of boron steel in its construction.&lt;ref name=US_Transit_press_release&gt;{{cite web | title=ALL-NEW FORD TRANSIT: BETTER GAS MILEAGE THAN E-SERIES; BEST-IN-CLASS GAS ENGINE TORQUE, CARGO CAPACITY |url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2014/06/04/all-new-ford-transit.html |publisher=Ford Motor Company |accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production ===
Worldwide production of Ford Transits takes place in two facilities; all European and Asian Transit production is from [[Ford Otosan]] in [[Kocaeli Province]], Turkey; this factory will also provide a percentage of global exports. North American and South American production is primarily sourced from [[Ford Kansas City Assembly Plant|Kansas City Assembly]] in [[Claycomo, Missouri]] on the lines used for the previous generation [[Ford Escape]]; production at the Kansas City Assembly Plant began on 30 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2014/04/30/new-kansas-city-employees-celebrate-start-of-2015-transit-production.html |title=2,000 New Ford Kansas City Employees Celebrate Start of Production of Game-Changing 2015 Ford Transit Van |work=ford.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ford Transit VJX6541DK-M is a Chinese market specific version, and is based on the third generation VE6/VE94 platform. This generation is only built in [[Nanchang]] by [[Jiangling Motors]] and is reserved for the Chinese domestic market. Remarkable are the much larger headlights and the larger grille. The model was launched to the market in 2006. Overall, the generation has 70 improvements to its predecessor. The interior has been changed and made more ergonomic. Power windows are standard, but ABS is optional. The Chinese Transit is available with two diesel engines and one petrol. One of them has a power of 67.6&amp;nbsp;kW (Type JX493ZQ3), the other 68&amp;nbsp;kW (JX493ZQ4). Both diesels have a capacity of 2,771&amp;nbsp;cc. The later diesel version has a common-rail 2.8-litre unit (with turbocharger and intercooler) that produces 80–85&amp;nbsp;kW. The Petrol version uses a Mitsubishi 4G64S4N Engine 92&amp;nbsp;kW inline-four motor.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The top speed is specified at {{convert|68.35|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The Chinese Transits have a [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]] in following form: LJXBMCH1××T××××××.

The European 2006 Ford Transit went into production in 2008. On the Chinese market it is known as the ''New Transit''. It is offered parallel to the 2006 China generation. The two facilities are currently manufacturing 300,000 units annually. Ford and Jiangling want to open a third plant in late 2012 to increase the annual production to further 3,000 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sun Press |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20100718/bs_nm/us_ford_jiangling_china |title=Ford breaks ground on $300 million China plant |publisher=Yahoo!

In January 2010, the [[2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls|Toyota recalls]] affected the products of the Ford Group because Ford used the same supplier ([[CTS Corporation]]). It was suspected that the accelerator pedals were defective and posed a danger. About 1600 Ford Transits of the 2006 China generation were affected by the recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Peskett |first=Karl |url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/55108/ford-transit-production-in-china-also-stopped-due-to-pedal-issues/ |title=Ford Transit production in China also stopped due to pedal issues |publisher=Car Advice |date=30 January 2010 |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European models of the VE6 and VE8 generation can be given an aftermarket facelift to the Chinese version. This needs the Chinese components and manual skills. Production finally came to an end in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foongleongsoon.blogspot.com/2007/07/ford-transit-facelift-parts-arrived.html |title=Ford Transit facelift parts arrived! |publisher=Foongleongsoon.blogspot.com |date=18 July 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--information taken from: http://www.jmc.com.cn/ --&gt;
===JMC Teshun===
{{main article|JMC Teshun}}
[[File:JMC Teshun.jpg|thumb|left|JMC Teshun in Shanghai]]
Starting from May 2017, a version of the old Transit manufactured by [[Jiangling Motors|JMC]] was rebadged and slightly redesigned. The rebadged version is called the '''JMC Teshun'''. Pricing ranges from 99,800 yuan to 139,200 yuan. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2016/10/10/jmc-is-going-stormtrooper-with-new-old-mini-van/|title=JMC Is Going Stormtrooper With New-Old Mini Van}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants ==

=== County 4x4 ===
[[File:Ford Transit County 4x4.jpg|thumb|left|Mk3 County 4x4 Transit]]
A handful of companies offered four-wheel-drive conversions, such as County Tractors of Knighton in Powys,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.transitcounty4x4.co.uk/ |publisher=Ford Transit County 4X4 |accessdate=17 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108002600/http://www.transitcounty4x4.co.uk/ |archivedate=8 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; who converted vans on behalf of Ford as a [[Special Vehicle Operations]] factory option. The first Transit County models were based on the Mk2 Transit model, both long and short wheelbase. The conversion used a [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 44F front axle and a NP208 transfer box, both lifted from the Ford Bronco, coupled to the regular Transit engine, gearbox and rear axle using three custom propshafts. The Transit rear axle was retained, mounted to a rear subframe or 'lift cradle' to give the extra ride height. Other modifications were 16-inch wheel rims, locking front hubs, a heavy-duty steering box and 305&amp;nbsp;mm diameter front brake discs.

With the introduction of the Mk3 Transit in 1986 came the next generation of the County 4x4. This would prove to be a very popular and successful version of the County Transit 4x4, and the last to use the Dana beam axle layout. Later County 4x4 models switched to using an independent front suspension setup which was inherently more complex in design than the earlier beam axle models. Later panel vans also lost the twin-wheel rear axle that had been fitted on earlier LWB versions.

Mainly used by utility companies such as National Grid, the Ministry Of Defence, and by mountain rescue teams, the Transit County 4x4 proved to be a capable vehicle both on and off road, with the ability to carry both crew and equipment just about anywhere.

Design and supply of drivetrain components for County 4x4 models passed to Countytrac, a division of M.J. Allen Ltd, who are still involved in the development of the latest Mk7 AWD Transit and Connect models.{{Clear left}}

=== Tourneo ===
[[File:Metropolitan Police Ford Tourneo.JPG|thumb|left|Ford Tourneo with [[Metropolitan Police]]]]
[[File:Ford Tourneo, Mark 5, rear view.jpg|thumb|right|Ford Tourneo]]

Introduced as part of the 1995 redesign of the Transit, the Tourneo is a Transit-based 8 or 9-seat minibus, but over the years has become increasingly better trimmed up to the point where it can almost be classified as a large MPV. Featuring back seats and back windows similar to a [[minivan]], the Tourneo is also considered an [[Executive car|executive]] transport vehicle and is often supplied with alloy wheels. Since its introduction, the Tourneo has followed the same development cycle as the Transit; both versions receive updates at the same time.

A smaller minivan version of the Tourneo was introduced in 2002; branded the [[Ford Transit Connect#Tourneo Connect|Tourneo Connect]], it was based on the Transit Connect [[mini MPV]].

'''Giving Back to Africa''' is a 501(c)(3) [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], [[Indiana]] based non-profit organization dedicated to the long-term mission of educating young people in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givingbacktoafrica.org|title=Giving Back to Africa|website=Giving Back to Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; In partnership with local Congolese educational institutions and [[non-governmental organization]]s, its goal is to empower GBA beneficiaries - through service-centered education - to become servant-leaders capable of taking control of their own lives while serving as change agents in their local communities and throughout the Democratic Republic of Congo. The organization was featured in the [[Bloom Magazine]], December 2008/January 2009 issue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magbloom.com/PDF/bloom15/Bloom_Africa_15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Hi-VAWT's turbines utilize a combined [[Darrieus wind turbine|Darrieus]] and [[Savonius wind turbine]]. Savonius turbine is a drag-type wind turbine that perform well under low-wind speed condition, while Darrieus turbine is a lift-type wind turbine that perform best at high-wind speed condition. The vertical axis allowing the turbine to take wind from all directions simultaneously. While the combo-blades provide a self-starting performance while maintain a good working condition in higher wind speed situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Small Scale Wind Turbines Optimized for Low Wind Speeds|url=https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/45531/Hayes_Proceedings_Paper.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1783">'''Jog''' describes the turns of a [[dislocation]] line inside a [[crystal structure]]. A [[dislocation]] line is rarely uniformly straight as in the figure, often containing many curves and/or steps to facilitate movement through the crystal in incremental amounts, rather than shifting the entire line at once.  One of these step types is a jog, the other is a kink.  However, both are typically referred to as jogs, which can be a source of confusion.

Segments of [[dislocation]] line that have a component of their sense vector normal to the glide plane are termed '''jogs'''.&lt;ref&gt;Hirth, Lothe, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; See image for the definitions of the sense vector and the glide plane.
Segments of dislocation line that do not leave the original glide plane are termed '''kinks'''.

Jogs are often very immobile compared to kinks, and require diffusion of crystallographic defects like vacancies or interstitial atoms to [[Dislocation#Dislocation_climb|climb]].  They are not capable of glide (movement in the [[glide plane]]) because the direction of motion is in the plane normal direction, not on the plane itself as with kinks.
[[Image:Disloc coin.JPG|thumb|300px|Schematic representation of an [[edge dislocation]] in a crystal lattice. The yellow plane is the [[glide plane]], the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] '''u''' is the dislocation sense vector, '''b''' is the [[Burgers vector]]. When the dislocation moves from left to right through the crystal, the lower half of the crystal has moved one Burgers vector length to the left, relative to the upper half.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4061">The '''Kadowaki–Woods ratio''' is the ratio of ''A'', the quadratic term of the [[resistivity]] and ''γ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the linear term of the [[specific heat]]. This ratio is found to be a constant for [[transition metal]]s, and for heavy-[[fermion]] compounds, although at different values. 
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{KW} = \frac{A}{\gamma^2}&lt;/math&gt;

In 1968 M. J. Rice pointed out

&lt;/ref&gt; 
that the coefficient ''A'' should vary predominantly as the square of the linear electronic specific heat coefficient γ; in particular he showed that the ratio ''A/γ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  is material independent for the pure 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals. Heavy-fermion compounds are characterized by very large values of A and γ. Kadowaki and Woods

&lt;/ref&gt; showed that ''A/γ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is material-independent within the heavy-fermion compounds, and that it is about 25 times larger than in aforementioned transition metals.

&lt;/ref&gt; 
the ratio ''A/γ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; contains indeed several non-universal factors, including the square of the strength of the effective electron-electron interaction. Since in general the interactions differ in nature from one group of materials to another, the same values of ''A/γ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are only  expected within a particular group.

&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a re-scaling of ''A/γ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to account for unit cell volume, dimensionality, carrier density and multi-band effects. In 2009 Jacko, Fjaerestad, and Powell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It is a new way of doing [[rheology]], traditionally done using a [[rheometer]]. There are two types of microrheology: ''passive microrheology'' and ''active microrheology''. Passive microrheology uses inherent [[thermal energy]] to move the tracers, whereas active microrheology uses externally applied forces, such as from a [[magnetic field]] or an [[optical tweezer]], to do so.  Microrheology can be further differentiated into 1- and 2-particle methods.&lt;ref name="Crocker2000"&gt;

== Passive microrheology==

'' Passive microrheology '' uses the thermal energy (''kT'') to move the tracers, although recent evidence suggests that active random forces inside cells may instead move the tracers in a diffusive-like manner.&lt;ref Name = "Guo"/&gt; The trajectories of the tracers are measured optically either by microscopy or by [[diffusing-wave spectroscopy]] (DWS). From the [[mean squared displacement]] with respect to time (noted MSD or &lt;Δ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; ), one can calculate the visco-elastic moduli ''G''&amp;prime;(''ω'') and ''G''&amp;Prime;(''ω'') using the [[Einstein relation (kinetic theory)|generalized Stokes–Einstein relation]] (GSER). Here is a view of the trajectory of a particle of micrometer size.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Brownian_trajectory.png|Typical trajectory of a Brownian particle (simulation)
Image:examples_MSD_pure_viscous_and_elastic.png|Two examples of MSD: one for a purely viscous fluid (free diffusion) and one for a viscolelastic fluid (trapped by elastic network)
Image:Film particule ds polymere.gif|Animation of a particle in a polymer-like network
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In a standard passive microrheology test, the movement of dozens of tracers is tracked in a single video frame. The motivation is to average the movements of the tracers and calculate a robust MSD profile.

Observing the MSD for a wide range of integration time scales (or frequencies) gives information on the microstructure of the medium where are diffusing the tracers.

If the tracers are having a free diffusion in a purely viscous material, the MSD should grows linearly with sampling integration time:

&lt;math&gt;&lt; \Delta r^2&gt;=4Dt&lt;/math&gt;.

If the tracers are moving in a spring-like fashion within a purely elastic material, the MSD should have no time dependence:

&lt;math&gt;&lt; \Delta r^2&gt;=Const&lt;/math&gt;

In most cases the tracers are presenting a sub-linear integration-time dependence, indicating the medium has intermediate viscoelastic properties. Of course, the slope changes in different time scales, as the nature of the response from the material is frequency dependent.

Microrheology is another way to do linear rheology. Since the force involved is very weak (order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; N), microrheology is guaranteed to be in the so-called linear region of the strain/stress relationship. It is also able to measure very small volumes (biological cell).

Given the complex viscoelastic modulus &lt;math&gt;G(\omega)=G'(\omega)+i G''(\omega)\,&lt;/math&gt; with ''G''&amp;#x2032;(''ω'') the elastic (conservative) part and ''G''&amp;#x2033;(''ω'') the viscous (dissipative) part and ''ω''=2''πf'' the pulsation. The GSER is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{G}(s)=\frac{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}{\pi a s \langle\Delta \tilde{r}^{2}(s)\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;

with 
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{G}(s)&lt;/math&gt;: [[Laplace]] transform of ''G''
:''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;: [[Boltzmann]] constant
:''T'': temperature in kelvins
:''s'': the Laplace frequency
:''a'': the radius of the tracer
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\Delta \tilde{r}^{2}(s)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;: the Laplace transform of the mean squared displacement

A related method of passive microrheology involves the tracking positions of a particle at high frequency, often with a quadrant photodiode.&lt;ref name="Schnurr1997"&gt;

== Two Point Microrheology&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==

There could be many artifacts that change the values measured by the passive microrheology tests, resulting in a disagreement between microrheology and normal [[rheology]]. These artifacts include tracer-matrix interactions, tracer-matrix size mismatch and more.

A different microrheological approach studies the [[cross-correlation]] of two tracers in the same sample. In practice, instead of measuring the MSD - &lt;math&gt;&lt; \Delta r^2&gt;&lt;/math&gt;, movements of two distinct particles are measured - &lt;math&gt;&lt; \Delta r_1 \Delta r_2&gt;&lt;/math&gt;. Calculating the G(ω) of the medium between the tracers follows:

&lt;math&gt;\tilde{G}(s)=\frac{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}{2\pi R s \langle\Delta \tilde{r}_1(s)\Delta \tilde{r}_2(s)\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice this equation does not depend on '''a''', but instead in depends on '''R''' - the distance between the tracers (assuming R&gt;&gt;a).

Some studies has shown that this method is better in coming to agreement with standard rheological measurements (in the relevant frequencies and materials)

The force applied is a sinusoidal force with amplitude A and frequency ω -

&lt;math&gt;F=A sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

The response of the tracer is a factor of the matrix visco-elastic nature. If a matrix is totally elastic (a solid), the response to the acting force should be immediate and the tracers should be observed moving by-

&lt;math&gt;X_e=B sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;.

with &lt;math&gt;A/B = G(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;.

On the other hand, if the matrix is totally viscous (a liquid), there should be a phase shift of &lt;math&gt;90^o&lt;/math&gt; between the strain and the stress -

&lt;math&gt;X_v=B sin(\omega t + 90^o) = Bcos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

in reality, as most materials are visco-elastic, the phase shift observed is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\varphi&lt;90&lt;/math&gt;.

When φ&gt;45 the matrix is considered mostly in its "viscous domain" and when φ&lt;45 the matrix is considered mostly in its "elastic domain".

Given a measured response phase shift φ (sometimes noted as δ), this ratio applies:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{G''}{G'}=\frac{\frac{A}{B}sin(\varphi)}{\frac{A}{B}cos(\varphi)}=tan(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;

Similar response phase analysis is used in regular [[rheology]] testing.

More recently, it has been developed into [[Force spectrum microscopy]] to measure contributions of random active motor proteins to diffusive motion in the [[cytoskeleton]].&lt;ref name="Guo"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Probing the Stochastic, Motor-Driven Properties of the Cytoplasm Using Force Spectrum Microscopy|last1=Guo|first1=Ming|display-authors=etal|journal=Cell|date=2014|volume=158

'''Mutual induction shaft mechanism''' is a [[power generation]] mechanism basically used by [[electrostatic charge]] excitation mechanism. This mechanism was developed by Shayantan Bhattacharya, an engineering student, while he was in college.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} This invention relates to the conversion of electrostatic charge generating materials with an external prime mover mechanism to use '''mutual induction shaft mechanism''' (MISM) to generate a [[charge density]] to get an output dynamic source of current. The output dynamic current is dependent on the amount of charge density being measured at prior sensors and multi meter and the length of the shaft. This mechanics is an trans-mechanic process. Electrostatic charge concentration of charging materials are being used for dynamic current generation by use of mutual induction shaft mechanism and the two opposite polarity is being achieved by a prime mover crank mechanism by virtue of which the circulation of wheels generating [[circular motion]] is being converted into reciprocating motion at two extreme ends of the prime mover and an appropriate charge density Q is being generated at two extreme ends and the estimation and the determination of the charge density Q is measured by multi meter at points down and connected to prime mover lattice. And in accordance of the charge density Q the following shaft is being set in mutual induction.

==Applications==

This mechanism can be used in electric power generation in remote areas and in particle analytical procedues including in atomic sciences to understand [[nuclear physics]], atomic structures.

[[File:Energia-Polyus drawing.png|thumbnail|upright=0.5|left|Polyus satellite on Energia launch vehicle.]]

The '''Polyus''' spacecraft ({{lang-ru|'''Полюс'''}}, ''[[geographical pole|pole]]''), also known as '''Polus''', '''Skif-DM''', [[GRAU]] index '''17F19DM''', was a prototype [[space weapon|orbital weapons platform]] designed to destroy [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] satellites with a megawatt [[Carbon dioxide laser|carbon-dioxide laser]].&lt;ref name=starwars&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.buran.ru/htm/str163.htm| title = "Звёздные войны, которых не было" (''Star Wars'' that didn't happen)| author = Konstantin Lantratov}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a [[Functional Cargo Block]] derived from a [[TKS spacecraft]] to control its orbit and it could fire test targets to demonstrate the fire control system.

The Polyus spacecraft was launched 15 May 1987 from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 250|Site 250]] as part of the first flight of the [[Energia]] system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bart Hendrickx|author2=Bert Vis|title=Energiya-Buran: The Soviet Space Shuttle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VRb1yAGVWNsC|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-73984-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but failed to reach orbit.

According to [[Yuri Kornilov]], Chief Designer of the Salyut Design Bureau, shortly before Polyus' launch, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] visited the Baikonur Cosmodrome and expressly forbade the in-orbit testing of its capabilities. Kornilov claims that Gorbachev was worried that it would be possible for Western governments to view this activity as an attempt to create a weapon in space and that such an attempt would contradict the country's previous statements on the USSR’s peaceful intent.&lt;ref name=kornilov&gt;{{cite journal| title = Unknown Polyus| author = Yuri Kornilov| journal = Earth and the Universe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For technical reasons, the payload was launched upside down.  It was designed to separate from the Energia, rotate 180 degrees in yaw, then 90 degrees in roll and then fire its engine to complete its boost to orbit. The Energia functioned perfectly.  However, after separation from Energia, the Polyus spun a full 360 degrees instead of the planned 180 degrees.  When the engine fired, it slowed and burned up in the atmosphere over the south Pacific Ocean.  This failure was attributed to a faulty [[inertial guidance system]] that had not been rigorously tested due to the rushed production schedule.&lt;ref name=grondine&gt;{{cite web |url         = http://www.astronautix.com/craft/polyus.htm |title = Polyus |author = Ed Grondine |accessdate = 2009-09-15 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100102201428/http://astronautix.com/craft/polyus.htm |archivedate = 2010-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts of the Polyus project's hardware were re-used in [[Kvant-2]], [[Kristall]], [[Spektr]] and [[Priroda]] [[Mir]] modules, as well as in the [[ISS]] module [[Zarya]].

==Development==
NPO ''Energia'' received orders from the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]] to begin research on space-based strike weapons in the mid-70s. Even before, the USSR had been developing maneuverable satellites for the purpose of satellite interception. By the beginning of the 1980s, ''Energia'' had proposed two programs: laser-equipped ''Skif'' and guided missiles platform ''Kaskad'' (where ''Skif'' would cover the low-orbit targets, ''Kaskad'' engaged targets in high and geosynchronous orbits). Together with NPO ''Astrofizika'' and KB ''Salyut'', they began developing their orbital weapons platform based on the [[Salyut program|Salyut]] DOS-17K frame.

Later, when the objective of ICBM interception proved too difficult, the aims of the project were shifted towards anti-satellite weapons. The 1983 announcement by the US of their SDI program prompted further political and financial support for the satellite interceptor program. In the nuclear exchange scenario, the interceptors would destroy the SDI satellites, followed by a so-called  "pre-emptive retaliation" large-scale Soviet ICBM launch.

The laser chosen for the ''Skif'' spacecraft was the 1-megawatt [[carbon dioxide laser]], developed for the [[Beriev A-60]] aircraft (an Il-76 flying laboratory with a combat laser). The introduction of the ''Energia'', capable of launching about 95 tonnes into orbit, finally allowed the spacecraft to accommodate the massive laser. The massive exhaust of the carbon-dioxide laser precipitated the objective of making the laser "recoil-less". The ''zero-torque exhaust system'' (SBM) was developed to that end. Its testing in orbit meant the release of a large cloud of carbon dioxide, which would hint at the satellite's purpose. Instead, the xenon-krypton mix would be used to simultaneously test the SBM and perform an innocent experiment on Earth's [[ionosphere]].

In 1985, the decision was made to test-launch the new ''Energia'' launch vehicle, which was still in the [[testbed]] phase. A 100-ton dummy payload was initially considered for the launch, but in a series of last-minute changes, it was decided that the almost-completed ''Skif'' spacecraft would be launched instead for a 30-day mission.

The development of the real ''Skif'' was completed in just one year, from September 1985 to September 1986. Testing and tweaking the ''Energia'' launch vehicle, the launch pad and the ''Skif'' itself moved the launch to February, and later to May 1987. According to Boris Gubanov, the head designer of the ''Energia'' launch vehicle, the work schedule of the preceding years was exhausting, and at the point of Mikhail Gorbachev's visit on 11 May, he asked the Soviet premier to clear the launch now, because "there will be heart attacks".

The catastrophic malfunction that led to ''Skif'' entering the atmosphere in the same area as ''Energia's'' second stage was successfully investigated. It was found that 568 seconds after launch, the timing control device gave the logical block a command to discard the side modules' covers and laser exhaust covers. Unknowingly, the same command was earlier used to open the solar panels and disengage the maneuvering thrusters. This wasn't discovered because of the logistics of the testing process and overall haste. Main thrusters engaged while the ''Skif'' kept turning, overshooting the intended 180-degree turn. The spacecraft lost speed and reverted to the [[ballistic trajectory]].

The '''quietrevolution''' is a discontinued brand of [[vertical-axis wind turbine]].  The helical design is most similar to the [[Gorlov helical turbine]]. Both are an evolution of the [[Darrieus wind turbine]].  It has won several awards including the "Sustainable Innovation Award" in 2006.

The turbine consists of three vertical [[airfoil]] blades, each having a [[Helix|helical]] twist of 120 degrees.  This feature spreads the [[torque]] evenly over the entire revolution, thus preventing the destructive pulsations of the straight-bladed giromill (Darrieus turbine).  The wind pushes each blade around on both the windward and [[leeward]] sides of the turbine.

The qr5 turbine, rated for 6 kW, measures 3.0m in diameter by 5m high.

Poor performance of a QR5 installed at Welsh government offices in [[Aberystwyth]] has been blamed on poor siting.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite news

[[File:Railroad tieswoodconcrete.jpg|thumb|Wooden ties are used on many traditional railways. In the background is a track with concrete ties.]]

A '''railroad tie'''/'''railway tie'''/'''crosstie''' ([[North America]]) or '''railway sleeper''' ([[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[South Asia]], [[Australasia]], and [[Africa]]) is a rectangular support for the [[Track (rail transport)|rails]] in [[railroad tracks]]. Generally laid perpendicular to the rails, ties transfer loads to the [[track ballast]] and [[subgrade]], hold the rails upright and keep them spaced to the correct [[rail gauge|gauge]].

Railroad ties are traditionally made of [[wood]], but [[pre-stressed concrete]] is now also widely used, especially in Europe and Asia. [[Steel]] ties are common on secondary lines in the UK;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steel Sleepers in the Rail Industry – they are still made, and have quite a history|url=https://shop.bsigroup.com/Navigate-by/Membership/Benefits-and-services/BSI-Knowledge-Centre/Withdrawn-standards/Steel-Sleepers-in-the-Rail-Industry-they-are-still-made-and-have-quite-a-history/|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Composite lumber|plastic composite]] ties are also employed, although far less than wood or concrete. As of January 2008, the approximate market share in North America for traditional and wood ties was 91.5%, the remainder being concrete, steel, [[Lophira alata|azobé]] (red ironwood) and plastic composite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=M/W Budgets To Climb in 2008|journal=Railway Track &amp; Structures|url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/sb/rts0108/index.php|accessdate=23 December 2011|date=January 2008|pages=18–25|issn=0033-9016|oclc=1763403|volume=104|issue=1|publisher=Simmons-Boardman Publishing Company|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 3,520 wooden crossties are used per mile of mainline railroad track in the US (distance between ties is [[Real versus nominal value#Measurement|nominally]] {{convert|18|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} including one tie and the crib), {{convert|3520|/mi|/km}} &lt;!-- See [[Talk:Railroad tie#Arithmetic]] --&gt; (40 per  {{convert|60|ft|m|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} rail) on main lines in the UK. Rails in the US may be fastened to the tie by a [[railroad spike]]; iron/steel [[Rail fastening systems#Rail supports|baseplates]] screwed to the tie and secured to the rail by a proprietary fastening system such as a [[Vossloh]] or [[Pandrol]] are commonly used in Europe.

==Types==

===Stone block===
[[File:Kilmarnock &amp; Troon railway sleeper.JPG|thumb|Stone block from the [[Kilmarnock and Troon Railway]]]]
The type of railroad tie used on the predecessors of the first true railway ([[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]) consisted of a pair of stone blocks laid into the ground, with the chairs holding the rails fixed to those blocks. One advantage of this method of construction was that it allowed horses to tread the middle path without the risk of tripping. In railway use with ever heavier locomotives, it was found that it was hard to maintain the correct [[Rail gauge|gauge]]. The stone blocks were in any case unsuitable on soft ground, such as at [[Chat Moss]], where timber ties had to be used. [[Railroad tie#Bi-block ties|Bi-block]] ties with a tie rod are somewhat similar.

===Wooden===
[[File:Geschweisster schienenstoss.jpeg|thumb|A variant fastening of rails to wooden ties]]
Historically wooden rail ties were made by hewing with an axe, called [[axe ties]] or sawn to achieve at least two flat sides.
A variety of [[softwood]] and [[hardwood]]s timbers are used as ties, [[oak]], [[jarrah]] and [[karri]] being popular hardwoods, although increasingly difficult to obtain, especially from sustainable sources.&lt;ref name="hay437-438"&gt;Hay 1982, pp. 437–438&lt;/ref&gt; Some lines use [[softwood]]s, including [[Douglas fir]]; while they have the advantage of accepting [[wood preservative|treatment]] more readily, they are more susceptible to wear but are cheaper, lighter (and therefore easier to handle) and more readily available.&lt;ref name="hay437-438"/&gt; Softwood is treated, while [[creosote]] is the most common preservative for railway ties, preservatives are also sometimes used such as [[pentachlorophenol]], [[chromated copper arsenate]] and a few other preservatives. Sometimes non-toxic preservatives are used, such as [[copper]] [[azole]] or micronized [[copper]]. New [[boron]]-based wood preserving technology is being employed by major US railroads in a dual treatment process in order to extend the life of wood ties in wet areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Crossties|date=March–April 2010|issn=0097-4536|oclc=1565511|publisher=Railway Tie Association|location=Paterson, New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some timbers (such as [[Shorea robusta|sal]], [[Mora (plant)|mora]], [[jarrah]] or [[azobé]]) are durable enough that they can be used untreated.&lt;ref&gt;Flint &amp; Richards 1992, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems with wooden ties include rot, splitting, insect infestation, plate-cutting, also known as chair shuffle in the UK (abrasive damage to the tie caused by lateral motion of the tie plate) and spike-pull (where the spike is gradually loosened from the tie). For more information on wooden ties the [[Railway Tie Association]] maintains a comprehensive website devoted to wood tie research and statistics.

Wooden ties can, of course, catch fire; as they age they develop cracks that allow sparks to lodge so that they catch fire more easily.

===Concrete===
{{main|Concrete sleeper}}
[[File:Concrete sleeper 1638.JPG|right|thumb|Concrete ties on the [[BNSF]] line north of [[Yakima, Washington]]]]
Concrete ties are cheaper and easier to obtain than timber{{dubious|date=December 2016}} and better able to carry higher axle-weights and sustain higher speeds. Their greater weight ensures improved retention of [[track geometry]], especially when installed with continuous-welded rail. Concrete ties have a longer service life and require less maintenance than timber due to their greater weight, which helps them remain in the correct position longer. Concrete ties need to be installed on a well-prepared subgrade with an adequate depth on free-draining ballast to perform well. Concrete ties amplify wheel noise, so wooden ties are often used in densely populated areas.

On the highest categories of line in the UK (those with the highest speeds and tonnages), pre-stressed concrete ties are the only ones permitted by [[Network Rail]] standards.

Most European railways also now use concrete bearers in switches and crossing layouts due to the longer life and lower cost of concrete bearers compared to timber, which is increasingly difficult and expensive to source in sufficient quantities and quality.

===Steel===
[[File:Pine Creek Rail Steel Sleepers DSC03637.jpg|thumb|Steel ties]]
Steel ties are formed from pressed steel and are trough-shaped in section. The ends of the tie are shaped to form a "spade" which increases the lateral resistance of the tie. Housings to accommodate the fastening system are welded to the upper surface of the tie. Steel ties are now in widespread use on secondary or lower-speed lines in the UK where they have been found to be economical to install due their ability to be installed on the existing ballast bed. Steel ties are lighter in weight than concrete and able to stack in compact bundles unlike timber. Steel ties can be installed onto the existing ballast, unlike concrete ties which require a full depth of new ballast. Steel ties are 100% recyclable and require up to 60% less ballast than concrete ties and up to 45% less than wood ties.

Historically, steel ties have suffered from poor design and increased traffic loads over their normally long service life. These aged and often obsolete designs limited load and speed capacity but can still be found in many locations globally and performing adequately despite decades of service. There are great numbers of steel ties with over 50 years of service and in some cases they can and have been rehabilitated and continue to perform well. Steel ties were also used in specialty situations, such as the [[Hejaz Railway]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], which had an ongoing problem with [[Bedouin]]s who would steal wooden ties for campfires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Hedjaz Railroad|journal=[[The Railroad Gazette]]|volume=42|issue=23|page=800|date=7 June 1907|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-I1MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA800&amp;lpg=PA800&amp;dq=hejaz+railway+wooden+ties+fires&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WzB0XcSSiE&amp;sig=aGhHDJyc4lS72VQDTxgT1SvUWQk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9iL2Tf2CBMeugQf-9LHsCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 December 2011|issn=0097-6679|oclc=15110419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern steel ties handle heavy loads, have a proven record of performance in signalized track, and handle adverse track conditions. Of high importance to railroad companies is the fact that steel ties are more economical to install in new construction than creosote-treated wood ties and concrete ties. Steel ties are utilized in nearly all sectors of the worldwide railroad systems including heavy-haul, class 1s, regional, shortlines, mining, electrified passenger lines (OHLE) and all manner of industries. Notably, steel ties (bearers) have proven themselves over the last few decades to be advantageous in turnouts (switches/points) and provide the solution to the ever-growing problem of long timber ties for such use.

When insulated to prevent conduction through the ties, steel ties may be used with [[track circuit]] based train detection and track integrity systems. Without insulation, steel ties may only be used on lines without block signaling and [[level crossings]] or on lines that use other forms of train detection such as [[axle counter]]s.

===Plastics===
[[File:KLP Hybrid Plastic Sleeper.JPG|thumb|KLP Hybrid Plastic Railroad Tie]]
[[File:Tie placer.JPG|thumb|Tie placer in [[Hyannis, Massachusetts]]]]

In more recent times, a number of companies are selling composite railroad ties manufactured from [[plastic recycling#Applications|recycled plastic]] resins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polywood Composite Railroad Ties Facts|url=http://www.polywood.com/plastic-railway-sleepers.html|work=Polywood Inc|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[recycling|recycled]] rubber. Manufacturers claim a service life longer than wooden ties with an expected lifetime in the range of 30–80 years, that the ties are impervious to rot and [[insect]] attack,{{sfnp|Grant|2005|p=145}}{{sfnp|Harper|2002|p=742}}{{sfnp|La Mantia|2002|p=145}} and that they can be modified with a special relief on the bottom to provide additional lateral stability.{{sfnp|Grant|2005|p=145}} In some main track applications the hybrid plastic tie has a recessed design to be completely surrounded by ballast.

Aside from the environmental benefits of using recycled material, plastic ties usually replace timber ties soaked in creosote, the latter being a toxic chemical,{{sfnp|La Mantia|2002|p=277}} and are themselves recyclable.{{sfnp|Grant|2005|p=145}} Hybrid plastic railroad ties and composite ties are used in other rail applications such as underground mining operations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miningweekly.com/article.php?a_id=64354 |title=Polymer rail ties being tested for the mining industry|last=Cromberge|first=Peter|date=1 April 2005|publisher=Mining Weekly |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; industrial zones, humid environments and densely populated areas. Hybrid railroad ties are also used to be partly exchanged with rotten wooden ties, which will result in continuous track stiffness. Hybrid plastic ties and composite ties also offer benefits on bridges and viaducts, because they lead to better distribution of forces and reduction of vibrations into respectively bridge girders or the ballast. This is due to better damping properties of hybrid plastic ties and composite ties, which will decrease the intensity of vibrations as well as the sound production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

The Cable TV series ''Factory Made'' has a segment on the manufacture of plastic ties.&lt;ref&gt;Factory Made 30 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[New Zealand]] ordered a trial batch of "EcoTrax" brand recycled composite ties from Axion for use on turnouts and bridges,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.railwaygazette.com/news/policy/single-view/view/final-phase-of-kiwirail-turnaround-funded.html?cHash=a7bf411a891ff8ae641b5f3b746aead6&amp;sword_list%5B%5D=plastic&amp;sword_list%5B%5D=sleeper&amp;no_cache=1|title=Final phase of KiwiRail turnaround funded|last=|first=|date=|work=Railway Gazette|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Track &amp; Signal]] Autumn 2013, p23&lt;/ref&gt; and a further 3-year order in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.recyclingtoday.com/article/axion-new-zealand-plastics-contract/|title=Axion secures $8 million contract for recycled railroad ties in New Zealand|last=|first=|date=|work=Recycling Today|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then Axion filed for bankruptcy in December 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/753048/000114420416103385/v440372_8k.htm|title=AXION INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS, INC.|last=|first=|date=May 18, 2016|website=US SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it continues to trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.axionsi.com/products-composite-railroad-ties/|title=ECOTRAX® Composite Railroad Ties for Main Line, Road Crossings, Tunnels, Bridges, Switches &amp; Turnouts|date=2016-05-31|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ties are developed by Dr. Nosker at Rutgers University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Non-conventional tie forms==

===Y-shaped ties===
[[File:Gleise y normal stahlschwellen.jpg|Y tie track next to conventional track|thumb]]
An unusual form of tie is the Y-shaped tie, first developed in 1983. Compared to conventional ties the volume of ballast required is reduced due to the load-spreading characteristics of the Y-tie.&lt;ref name="ob"/&gt;  Noise levels are high but the resistance to track movement is very good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.promain.org/images/counsil/08_Selection_of_Tack_Systems.pdf|title=Innovative Track Systems: Criteria for their Selection|last1=Ogilvie|first1=Nigel|last2=Quante|first2=Franz|date=17 October 2001|publisher=ProMain|accessdate=23 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727185702/http://www.promain.org/images/counsil/08_Selection_of_Tack_Systems.pdf|archivedate=27 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For curves the three-point contact of a Y steel tie means that an exact geometric fit cannot be observed with a fixed attachment point.

The cross section of the ties is an [[I-beam]].&lt;ref name="mb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pavement.wes.army.mil/papers/41/Paper41.pdf|title=Advanced track design|last=Budisa|first=Miodrag|accessdate=23 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824034604/http://pavement.wes.army.mil/papers/41/Paper41.PDF|archivedate=24 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006 less than {{convert|1,000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of Y-tie track had been built, of which approximately 90 percent is in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="ob"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oberbauhandbuch.de/y-stahlschwelle.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070814214300/http://www.oberbauhandbuch.de/y-stahlschwelle.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 August 2007 |title=Y-Stahlschwelle |author=February 28, 2006 |work=Some information derived from a lecture by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Karl Endmann |publisher=oberbauhandbuch.de |accessdate=18 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twin ties===
The ZSX Twin tie is manufactured by Leonhard Moll Betonwerke GmbH &amp; Co KG and is a pair of two pre-stressed concrete ties longitudinally connected by four steel rods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moll-betonwerke.de/downloads/MollZSX.pdf|title=ZSX Twin Sleeper|publisher=moll-betonwerke.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design is said to be suitable for track with sharp curves, track subject to temperature stress such as that operated by trains with [[Eddy current brake|eddy brakes]], and bridges, and as transition track between traditional track and slab track or bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gleisbau-welt.de/site/material/material_zwillingschwellen.html|title=ZSX Zwillingsschwelle—die besondere Spannbetonschwelle|publisher=gleisbau-welt.de|accessdate=23 December 2011|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307231110/http://gleisbau-welt.de/site/material/material_zwillingschwellen.html|archive-date=2012-03-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wide ties===
Concrete monoblock ties have also been produced in a wider form (e.g. {{convert|57|cm|inch|frac=8|abbr=on|disp=or}}) such that there is no ballast between the ties; this wide tie increases lateral resistance and reduces ballast pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railone.com/en/main-nav/products/railways-and-commuter-traffic/ballasted-track-systems/special-track-systems/wide-sleeper-track.html#c1707|title=Wide sleepers: so far, so good!|publisher=railone.com |accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfleiderer-track.com/fileadmin/dateien/03_Broschueren/EN/breitschwelle_en.pdf|title=Wide sleeper track|publisher=RAIL.ONE GmbH|accessdate=23 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307224156/http://www.pfleiderer-track.com/fileadmin/dateien/03_Broschueren/EN/breitschwelle_en.pdf|archivedate=7 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pfleiderer-track.com/fileadmin/bilder/03_Download/Bilddatenbank/klein/TS_06.jpg |title=Image Ballasted wide sleeper |author= |work= |publisher=pfleiderer-track.com |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715071830/http://www.pfleiderer-track.com/fileadmin/bilder/03_Download/Bilddatenbank/klein/TS_06.jpg |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system has been used in Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQQ/is_5_43/ai_102286989/?tag=content;col1|title=Wide-sleeper track gains official approval |last1=Bachmann|first1=Hans|last2=Unbehaun|first2=Olaf|date=May 2003|journal=International Railway Journal|location=New York, New York|publisher=Simmons-Boardman Publishing Corporation|issn=2161-7376|accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; where wide ties have also been used in conjunction with the GETRAC A3 ballastless track systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railone.com/en/main-nav/products/railways-and-commuter-traffic/ballastless-track-systems/getrac.html |title=Ballastless track system GETRAC—Asphalt in top form |publisher=railone.com|accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pfleiderer-track.com/fileadmin/bilder/03_Download/Bilddatenbank/klein/TS_05.jpg |title=Image Ballastless GETRAC A3 wide sleeper track system |author= |work= |publisher=pfleiderer-track.com |accessdate=23 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715071850/http://www.pfleiderer-track.com/fileadmin/bilder/03_Download/Bilddatenbank/klein/TS_05.jpg |archivedate=15 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bi-block ties===
Bi-block (or twinblock) ties consist of two concrete rail supports joined by a steel bar. Advantages include increased lateral resistance and lower weight than monobloc concrete ties, as well as elimination of damage from torsional forces on the ties center due the more flexible steel connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itb-tradetech.com/content/default.asp?page=7173|title=Traverses béton bi-blocs VDH|author=|work=|publisher=itb-tradetech.com|accessdate=23 September 2010|language=fr|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713064604/http://www.itb-tradetech.com/content/default.asp?page=7173|archivedate=13 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tie type is in common use in France,{{sfnp|Bonnett|2005|p=64}} and are used on the high-speed [[TGV]] lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://freeit.free.fr/The%20Civil%20Engineering%20Handbook,2003/0958%20ch60.pdf|chapter=Chapter 60.

Frame ties (German: ''Rahmenschwelle'') comprise both lateral and longitudinal members in a single monolithic concrete casting.&lt;ref name="mb"/&gt; This system is in use in [[Austria]];&lt;ref name="mb"/&gt; in the Austrian system the track is fastened at the four corners of the frame, and is also supported midway along the frame. Adjacent frame ties are butted close to each other. Advantages of this system over conventional cross increased support of track. In addition, construction methods used for this type of track are similar to those used for conventional track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trbrail.com/pdfs/LTK/Session2DaveStaplin/Sess2Pres1Rev1WashingtonII2.pdf |title=Fieldexperience with frame–tie-constructions |author=Klaus Riessberger |date=January 2004 |work=Institute for Railway Engineering and Transport Economy |publisher=trbrail.com |accessdate=22 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717093600/http://trbrail.com/pdfs/LTK/Session2DaveStaplin/Sess2Pres1Rev1WashingtonII2.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ladder track===
{{Main|Ladder track}}
In ladder track the ties are laid parallel to the rails and are several [[meter]]s long. The structure is similar to [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel's]] baulk track; these longitudinal ties can be used with ballast, or with [[elastomer]] supports on a solid non-ballasted support.

==Fastening rails to railroad ties==
{{Main|rail fastening systems}}

Various methods exist for fixing the rail to the railroad ties. Historically spikes gave way to cast iron chairs fixed to the tie, more recently springs (such as [[Pandrol clip]]s) are used to fix the rail to the tie chair.

==Other uses==
[[File:Northfield railway station class 323 and sleepers.jpg|thumb|Wooden ties recycled as [[sculpture]]s at [[Northfield railway station]]]]
[[File:Stone railway sleeper block.JPG|thumb|left|Stone block from the [[Scotch gauge]] [[Ardrossan Railway]] used to construct a loading dock]]
In recent years, wooden railroad ties have also become popular for [[gardening]] and [[landscaping]], both in creating [[retaining wall]]s and raised-bed gardens, and sometimes for building steps as well. Traditionally, the ties sold for this purpose are decommissioned ties taken from rail lines when replaced with new ties, and their lifespan is often limited due to rot. Some entrepreneurs sell new ties. Due to the presence of wood [[preservative]]s such as [[coal tar]], [[creosote]] or [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s of [[heavy metals]], railroad ties introduce an extra element of [[soil]] [[pollution]] into gardens and are avoided by many property owners.  In the UK, new [[oak]] beams of the same size as standard railroad ties, but not treated with dangerous chemicals, are now available specifically for garden construction. They are about twice the price of the recycled product. In some places, railroad ties have been used in the construction of homes, particularly among those with lower incomes, especially near railroad tracks, including railroad employees. They are also used as [[Crib pier|cribbing]] for [[Dock (maritime)|docks]] and [[boathouses]].

The Spanish artist [[Agustín Ibarrola]] has used recycled ties from [[Renfe Operadora|Renfe]] in several projects.

In Germany, use of wooden railroad ties as building material (namely in gardens, houses and in all places where regular contact to human skin would be likely, in all areas frequented by children and in all areas associated with the production or handling of food in any way) has been prohibited by law since 1991 because they pose a significant risk to health and environment. From 1991 to 2002, this was regulated by the ''Teerölverordnung'' ([[Carbolineum]] By-law), and since 2002 has been regulated by the ''[[:de:Chemikalien-Verbotsverordnung|Chemikalien-Verbotsverordnung]]'' (Chemicals Prohibition By-law), §1 and Annex, Parts 10 and 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bundesrecht.juris.de/chemverbotsv/index.html|title=Chemikalien-Verbotsverordnung|author=|work=|publisher=Bundesministerium der Justiz|accessdate=23 September 2010|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905103537/http://bundesrecht.juris.de/chemverbotsv/index.html|archive-date=2010-09-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballastless track==
[[File:Schwellen Rheda.jpg|thumb|Slab track, System "Rheda 2000", prior to concrete pouring]]{{Main articles|Ballastless track}}
[[File:Feste Fahrbahn FFBögl.jpg|thumb|Slab track, System "FF Bögl" on [[Nuremberg–Munich high-speed railway|Nuremberg–Munich high-speed rail line]]]]
[[File:Slab track at St Pancras.jpg|thumb|Slab track at [[St Pancras station]]]]

Ballastless track does not require underlying ballast to maintain its integrity. The first such tracks were used for mountain railways (such as the [[Pilatus Railway]], built in 1889), with the rails being attached directly to the mountain rock. From the late 1960s onwards, [[Germany|German]], [[UK|British]], [[Switzerland|Swiss]] and [[Japan]]ese railways experimented with alternatives to the traditional railroad tie, in an effort to create track with greater accuracy and longevity, along with lower maintenance costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eisenmann|first1=J.|last2=Leykauf|first2=G.|editor-first=J|editor-last=Eibl|chapter=Feste Fahrbahn für Schienenbahnen|title=Betonkalender 2000|volume=2|publisher=Ernst &amp; Sohn|location=Berlin|year=2000|pages=291–298|isbn=978-3-433-01427-1|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This gave rise to the ballastless railway track, especially in tunnels, on high-speed railway lines, and on lines where high train frequency imposes greater stress on the track. Paved concrete track&lt;ref&gt;Or PCT, or PACT&lt;/ref&gt; has the rail fastened directly to a [[concrete]] slab about a {{convert|1/2|m|in|spell=in|sp=us}} thick,&lt;ref name="krylov177"&gt;{{cite book | last = Krylov | first = V. V. | title = Noise and vibration from high-speed trains | publisher = Thomas Telford | location = London | year = 2001 | isbn = 0727729632 
|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; without ties. A similar but less expensive alternative is to accurately position concrete ties and then pour a [[concrete slab]] between and around them. This method is called "cast-in precast sleeper track".&lt;ref&gt;Bonnett 2005, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;

These systems offer the advantage of superior stability and almost complete absence of deformation. Ballastless track systems incur significantly lower [[Track (rail transport)#Maintenance|maintenance]] costs compared to ballasted track.&lt;ref name="krylov177"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cook233"&gt;Cook 1988, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the absence of any ballast, damage by flying ballast is eliminated, something that occurs at speeds in excess of {{convert|250|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}. It is also useful in renovating existing [[railroad tunnel]]s. Because slab track allows shallower construction than ballasted track, it may provide the extra overhead clearance necessary for converting a line to [[overhead lines|overhead electrification]], or allow the passage of trains with a greater [[loading gauge]].&lt;ref name="bonnett78"&gt;Bonnett 2005, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Building a slab track is more expensive than building traditional ballasted track,&lt;ref name="cook233"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bonnett78" /&gt; which has slowed its introduction outside of [[high-speed rail]] lines. Slab track is also difficult to modify after it has been installed,&lt;ref name="bonnett78"/&gt; and the curing time of concrete makes it difficult to convert an existing, busy railway line to a ballastless set-up.&lt;ref name="cook233"/&gt;

Slab track can also generate significantly more [[noise pollution]] and cause more [[vibration]] than traditional ballasted track. While this is partly attributable to slab track's decreased [[sound absorption]] qualities, a more significant factor is that slab track typically uses softer rail fasteners to provide vertical compliance similar to ballasted track, and these can lead to more noise, because they permit the rail to [[vibration|vibrate]] over a greater length.&lt;ref name="krylov177"/&gt;

Where it is critical to reduce noise and vibration, the concrete slab can be supported on soft resilient bearings. This configuration, called "floating slab track", is expensive and requires more depth or height in the track structure,&lt;ref name="bonnett78"/&gt; but it can reduce noise and vibration by around 80%.{{Clarify|reason=80%compared to what?|date=December 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster 2001, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; GERB quote up to 35-40dB of attenuation using their steel sprung system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/contractors/noise/gerb-vibration-control-systems/|title=GERB Vibration Control Systems - Floating Slab Track Systems - Railway Technology|website=www.railway-technology.com|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Alternatively, the rail can be supported along its length by an elastic material; when combined with a smaller rail section, this can provide a significant noise reduction over traditional ballasted track.&lt;ref name="krylov177"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1698">The '''[[renewable energy policy]] of [[Bangladesh]]''' is a set of policies and programs set by the [[Government of Bangladesh]] to reach national goals in the field of [[renewable energy]] in the country.

Various government regimes have drafted such policies to supplement the [[Electricity sector in Bangladesh]]. The country faces mismanaged distribution and supply of electricity which is why it faces up to 2000 [[megawatt]]s of electricity shortage. This has forced hundreds of manufacturing firms across the country to shut down taking a toll on the national [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/2008/12/04/bangladesh-energy-renewables-idINDHA35320620081204 Bangladesh unveils renewable energy policy] (Dec 4th 2008) ''[[Reuters]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2507">'''Retrograde condensation''' occurs when [[gas]] in a tube is compressed beyond the point of condensation with the effect that the liquid evaporates again. This is the opposite of [[condensation]]: the so-called retrograde condensation.

==Description==
If the volume of two gases that are kept at constant [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] below [[supercritical fluid|critical conditions]] is gradually reduced, condensation will start. When a certain volume is reached, the amount of condensation will gradually increase upon further reduction in volume until the gases are liquefied. If the composition of the gases lies between their true and pseudo [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]s the condensate formed will disappear on continued reduction of volume.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knaw.nl/waals/pdf/Com4_Kuenen2.pdf On retrogade condensation and the critical phenomena of mixtures of two substances]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knaw.nl/waals/pdf/Com8_Kuenen.pdf On the abnormal phenomena near the critical point]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This disappearance of condensation is called retrograde condensation.

Because most [[natural gas]] found in [[petroleum reservoir]]s is not a pure product, when non-associated gas is extracted from a field under supercritical pressure/temperature conditions (i.e., the pressure in the reservoir decreases below [[dewpoint]]), [[Natural-gas condensate|condensate]] liquids may form during the [[Isothermal process|isothermic]] depressurizing, an effect called retrograde condensation.

==Discovery==
[[Johannes Petrus Kuenen]] discovered retrograde condensation and published his findings in April 1892 with the title "Metingen betreffende het oppervlak van Van der Waals voor mengsels van koolzuur en chloormethyl"
(Measurements on the [[Van der Waals surface]] for mixtures of [[carbonic acid]] and [[methyl]] [[chloride]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.scientificcommons.org/2421376 Metingen betreffende het oppervlak van Van der Waals voor mengsels van koolzuur en chloormethyl]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knaw.nl/waals/pdf/Com4_Kuenen.pdf Measurements on the surface of Van der Waals for mixtures of carbonic acid and methyl chloride] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050518021853/http://www.knaw.nl/waals/pdf/Com4_Kuenen.pdf |date=2005-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SiC–SiC matrix composite''' is a particular type of [[ceramic matrix composite]] (CMC) which have been accumulating interest mainly as high temperature materials for use in applications such as gas turbines, as an alternative to metallic [[alloy]]s. CMCs are generally a system of [[Composite material|material]]s that are made up of ceramic fibers or particles that lie in a [[ceramic]] matrix phase. In this case, a SiC/SiC composite is made by having a SiC ([[silicon carbide]]) matrix phase and a fiber phase incorporated together by different processing methods. Outstanding properties of SiC/SiC composites include high [[thermal]], [[Mechanics|mechanical]], and chemical stability while also providing high strength to [[weight ratio]].&lt;ref name ="Naslain"&gt;Naslain, R. R. (2005), SiC-Matrix Composites: Nonbrittle Ceramics for Thermo-Structural Application. International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology, 2: 75–84. doi: 10.1111/j.1744-7402.2005.02009.x&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processing ==
SiC/SiC composites are mainly processed through three different methods. However, these processing methods are often subjected to variations in order to create the desired structure or property:&lt;ref name="Naslain"/&gt;
# '''Chemical Vapor Infiltration (CVI)''' – The CVI method uses a gas phase SiC precursor to first grow SiC whiskers or nanowires in a preform, using conventional techniques developed with CVD. Following the growth of the fibers, the gas is again infiltrated into the preform to densify and create the matrix phase. Generally, the densification rate is slow during CVI, thus this process creates relatively high residual porosity (10–15%).&lt;ref name="Naslain"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yang | first1 = W. | last2 = Araki | first2 = H. | last3 = Kohyama | first3 = A. | last4 = Thaveethavorn | first4 = S. | last5 = Suzuki | first5 = H. | last6 = Noda | first6 = T. | doi = 10.1016/j.matlet.2004.05.059 | title = Fabrication in-situ SiC nanowires/SiC matrix composite by chemical vapour infiltration process | journal = Materials Letters | volume = 58 | issue = 25 | pages = 3145 | year = 2004 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Polymer Impregnation and Pyrolysis (PIP)''' – The PIP method uses polymeric SiC precursors to infiltrate into a fiberous preform to create a SiC matrix. This method yields low stoichiometry as well as crystallinity due to the polymer-to-ceramic conversion process. Additionally, shrinkage also occurs during this conversion process, resulting in 10–20% residual porosity. Multiple infiltrations can be performed to compensate for the shrinkage.&lt;ref&gt;Nannetti, C. A., Ortona, A., de Pinto, D. A. and Riccardi, B. (2004), Manufacturing SiC-Fiber-Reinforced SiC Matrix Composites by Improved CVI/Slurry Infiltration/Polymer Impregnation and Pyrolysis. Journal of the American Ceramic Society, 87: 1205–1209. doi: 10.1111/j.1551-2916.2004.tb20093.x&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Melt Infiltration (MI)''' – The MI method has several variations, including using a dispersion of SiC particulate slurry to infiltrate into the fiberous preform, or using CVI to coat carbon on the SiC fibers, followed with infiltrating liquid Si to react with the carbon to form SiC. With these methods, chemical reactivity, melt viscosity, and wetting between the two components should be considered carefully. Some issues with infiltrating melted Si is that the free Si can lower the composite's resistance to oxidation and creep. However, this technique usually yields lower residual porosity (~5%) compared to the other two techniques due to higher densification rates.&lt;ref name="Naslain"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brennan | first1 = J. J. | title = Interfacial characterization of a slurry-cast melt-infiltrated SiC/SiC ceramic-matrix composite | doi = 10.1016/S1359-6454(00)00248-2 | journal = Acta Materialia | volume = 48 | issue = 18–19 | pages = 4619–4628 | year = 2000 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hillig, W. B. (1988), Melt Infiltration Approach to Ceramic Matrix Composites. Journal of the American Ceramic Society, 71: C-96–C-99. doi: 10.1111/j.1151-2916.1988.tb05840.x&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
=== Mechanical properties ===
Mechanical properties of CMCs, including SiC–SiC composites can vary depending on the properties of their various components, namely, the fiber, matrix, and interphases. For example, the size, composition, crystallinity, or alignment of the fibers will dictate the properties of the composite. The interplay between matrix microcracking and fiber-matrix debonding often dominates the failure mechanism of SiC/SiC composites. This results in SiC/SiC composites having non-brittle behavior despite being fully ceramic. Additionally, creep rates at high temperatures are also extremely low, but still dependent on its various constituents.&lt;ref name="Naslain"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinoki, Tatsuya, Edgar Lara-Curzio, and Lance L. Snead. "Mechanical properties of high purity SiC fiber-reinforced CVI-SiC matrix composites." Fusion science and technology 44 (2003): 211–218.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermal properties ===
SiC–SiC composites have a relatively high thermal conductivity and can operate at very high temperatures due to their inherently high creep and oxidation resistance. Residual porosity and stoichiometry of the material can vary its thermal conductivity, with increasing porosity leading to lower thermal conductivity and presence of Si–O–C phase also leading to lower thermal conductivity. In general, a typical well processed SiC–SiC composite can achieve a thermal conductivity of around 30 W/m-K at 1000 Celsius.&lt;ref name="Naslain"/&gt;

=== Chemical properties ===
Since SiC–SiC composites are generally sought for in high temperature applications, their oxidation resistance is of high importance. The oxidation mechanism for SiC–SiC composites vary depending on the temperature range, with operation in the higher temperature range (&gt;1000&amp;nbsp;°C) being more beneficial than at lower temperatures (&lt;1000&amp;nbsp;°C). In the former case, passive oxidation generates a protective oxide layer wheres in the latter case, oxidation degrades the fiber-matrix interface. Nonetheless, oxidation is an issue and environmental barrier coatings are being investigated to address this issue.&lt;ref name="Naslain"/&gt;

'''Sodium tungsten bronze''' is a form of [[Intercalation (chemistry)|insertion compound]] with the formula Na&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''x'' is equal to or less than 1.&lt;!-- see ref "G&amp;E" --&gt; Named due to its metallic lustre, its electrical properties range from [[semiconducting]] to metallic depending on the concentration of sodium ions present; it can also exhibit [[superconductivity]].

==History==
Prepared in 1823 by the chemist [[Friedrich Wöhler]], sodium tungsten bronze was the first alkali metal bronze to be discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar family of [[molybdenum bronze]]s may have been discovered in 1885 by [[Alfred Stavenhagen]] and E. Engels,&lt;ref name=Stavenhagen/&gt; but they are formed in a very narrow range of temperatures and were not reported again until the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Wold/&gt;

==Properties==
Sodium tungsten bronze, like other tungsten bronzes, is resistant to chemical reaction under both acidic and basic conditions. Colour is dependent upon the proportion of sodium in the compound, ranging from golden at ''x''≈0.9, through red, orange and deep purple, to blue-black when ''x''≈0.3.

The electrical resistivity of the bronze depends on the proportion of sodium in the compound, with specific resistances of 1.66&amp;nbsp;mΩ being measured for some samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Straumanis | first1 = M.

For values of ''x'' below 0.3, the bronze is semiconducting rather than metallic.&lt;ref name = "G&amp;E" /&gt; When cooled sufficiently, sodium tungsten bronze becomes a [[superconductor]], with the critical temperature (''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'') for Na&lt;sub&gt;0.23&lt;/sub&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; being approximately 2.2&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ostenson | first1 = J. | last2 = Shanks | first2 = H. | last3 = Finnemore | first3 = D. | title = Superconductivity in the tungsten bronzes | doi = 10.1016/0022-5088(78)90024-3 | journal = Journal of the Less Common Metals | volume = 62 | pages = 149 | year = 1978 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first record of superconductivity in a tungsten bronze was in 1964, with a ''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' of 0.57&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Raub | first1 = C. | last2 = Sweedler | first2 = A. | last3 = Jensen | first3 = M. | last4 = Broadston | first4 = S. | last5 = Matthias | first5 = B. | title = Superconductivity of Sodium Tungsten Bronzes | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.13.746 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 13 | issue = 25 | pages = 746 | year = 1964 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode=1964PhRvL..13..746R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''x'' values between 0.9 and 0.3, the structure remains similar but with an increasing deficiency of sodium ions and a smaller lattice parameter.&lt;ref name = "Hägg" /&gt;

A number of other structure types can also be adopted, with varying electrical properties: cubic, tetragonal I and hexagonal phases are metallic, whereas orthorhombic and tetragonal II structures are semiconducting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ngai | first1 = K.

'''Spring steel''' is a name given to a wide range of [[steel|steels]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Engineering.com |url=http://www.engineering.com/Library/ArticlesPage/tabid/85/ArticleID/134/Springs.aspx |title=Springs |date=2006-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; used in the manufacture of [[Spring (device)|springs]], prominently in [[automobile|automotive]] and industrial suspension applications. These steels are generally [[Alloy steel#Low-alloy Steels|low-alloy]] [[manganese]], [[medium-carbon steel]] or [[high-carbon steel]] with a very high [[yield strength]]. This allows objects made of [[Spring (device)|spring]] steel to return to their original shape despite significant deflection or twisting.

==Grades==
Many grades of steel can be hardened and tempered to suit application as a spring; however, some steels exhibit more desirable characteristics for spring applications.

'''Ribbon''' solar cells are a 1970s technology most recently sold by [[Evergreen Solar]] (which is now in receivership, i.e. bankrupt and liquidated), among other manufacturers.

==Technology description==

Ribbon growth is a method of producing [[multi-crystalline silicon]] strips suitable for the [[photovoltaic industry]].

The name describes the manufacturing process, where a sheet of silicon [[the ribbon]] is pulled vertically from a bath of [[molten]] silicon to form a multi-crystalline [[silicon crystal]]s. The ribbon is then cut into lengths which are treated with traditional processes to form [[solar cell]]s. The process was developed in the 1970s by Mobil-Tyco, Solar Energy Corp., Energy Materials, Corp., Motorola and IBM. Ribbons 4-5 inches wide and less than 1/100th of an inch thick were made. It is similar to the dendrite process, developed by Westinghouse in the 1970s, which had the further advantage of having no ribbon (graphite or ceramic die), using only two special seed crystals, or "dendrites," which were dipped side by side into molten silicon and pulled up slowly. These demonstrated efficiencies upwards of 16% by 1980.&lt;ref&gt;"Photovoltaics - Sunlight to Electricity in One Step." Paul Maycock, Edward Stirewalt. Brick House Publishing Co, Andover, Mass. 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ribbon growth has the capability of using less silicon compared to other [[wafer]] production methods as wafers are manufactured to the approximately correct specification avoiding the need for sawing of silicon blocks. Silicon accounts for more than 50% of manufacturing costs in producing first generation solar cells, where much of the silicon is discarded as waste at the sawing stage of manufacture. Employing the string ribbon process allows the manufacture of PV grade silicon wafers to the approximate dimensions while avoiding the waste encountered when sawing wafers from ingots. This manufacturing process uses about half the amount of input silicon required by traditional processes.

String Ribbon technology is a technique where the ribbon is pulled from the silicon melt between two wires, it is not capable of achieving the same electrical performance as conventional wafer technology. Typically a cut wafer will convert 18-20% of the incoming light into electricity where String Ribbon Solar Cells are capable of converting 13-14%. In research laboratories the technology has reached as high as 18.3%, however it cannot be produced commercially to this specification.&lt;ref&gt;Fabrication and analysis of high-efficiency String Ribbon Si solar cells. K. Nakayashiki, B. Rounsaville, V. Yelundur, D.S. Kim, A. Rohatgi, R. Clark-Phelps, and J.I. Hanoka, Solid-State Electron. 50, 1406 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Wafer technologies have reached as high as 25% in laboratory conditions.

While String Ribbon technology has certain advantages as to the shape of the crystals, the overall thickness varies enough so that not every 'silicon strip' can be processed directly into a solar cell. In addition to this drawback, the growth process is thermally very inefficient. The radiating area/gram of crystal is extremely high, leading to very high energy expenses which offset the reduced silicon use/expense.

[[File:Styrofoam_Insulation.jpg|thumb|right|STYROFOAM Brand Insulation extruded polystyrene foam (XPS), owned and manufactured by Dow.]]

'''Styrofoam''' is a [[trademark]]ed brand of closed-cell [[polystyrene#Extruded polystyrene foam|extruded polystyrene foam]] (XPS), commonly called "Blue Board" manufactured as foam continuous [[building insulation]] board used in walls, roofs, and foundations as [[thermal insulation]] and water barrier. This material is light blue in color and is owned and manufactured by [[The Dow Chemical Company]].&lt;ref name="what-is-styrofoam"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080324134328/http://building.dow.com/styrofoam/what.htm Dow Chemical Company Styrofoam page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the colloquial use of the word ''styrofoam'' refers to another material that is usually white in color and made of expanded (not extruded) [[polystyrene|polystyrene foam]] ([[Expanded polystyrene|EPS]]). It is often used in [[disposable]] coffee cups and coolers, and as [[cushioning]] material in [[packaging]].&lt;ref name="what-is-styrofoam"/&gt; The [[Generic trademark|trademarked term is used generically]] although it is a different material from the extruded polystyrene used for Styrofoam [[Thermal insulation|insulation]]. 

The Styrofoam brand polystyrene foam, which is used for craft applications, can be identified by its roughness and the "crunch" it makes when cut.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Additionally, it is moderately soluble in many organic solvents, [[super glue|cyanoacrylate]], and the propellants and solvents of [[spray paint]].

== History ==
In 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2450436|title=Patent US 2450436 A. Manufacture of cellular thermoplastic products}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers in Dow's Chemical Physics Lab found a way to make foamed polystyrene. Led by [[Ray McIntire]], they rediscovered a method first used by [[Sweden|Swedish]] inventor [[Carl Georg Munters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Boundy

 | pages = 117–128
 | isbn = 0-8247-8097-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dow acquired exclusive rights to use Munters' patents and found ways to make large quantities of extruded polystyrene as a closed cell foam that resists moisture.

== Uses ==

Styrofoam has a variety of uses. Dow produces Styrofoam building materials, including varieties of [[building insulation]] sheathing and pipe insulation. The claimed [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] of Styrofoam insulation is five per inch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://building.dow.com/media/news/2007/20071205a.htm Dow Announces New Technology for STYROFOAM Insulation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Styrofoam can be used under roads and other structures to prevent soil disturbances due to freezing and thawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://building.dow.com/na/en/applications/geotech/index.htm|title=Geotechnical applications of Styrofoam|publisher = Dow Chemical| accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskool.org/resources/regional/nw_reg_pro/permafrost.html|title=Engineering considerations when building on permafrost|accessdate=2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Styrofoam is composed of 98% air, making it lightweight and buoyant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.forte-eps-solutions.com/styrofoam-sheets-polystyrene-insulation-difference-new-jersey-new-york-ontario-quebec.html|title= What is the Difference between EPS Polystyrene and (styrofoam)?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dow also produces Styrofoam as [[structural insulated panel]]s for use by [[florist]]s and in craft products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://craft.dow.com|title=STYROFOAM Brand Foam Crafts| accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dow insulation Styrofoam has a distinctive blue color; Styrofoam for craft applications is available in white and green.

'''Thai Airways International Flight 261 (TG261/THA261)''' was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from [[Bangkok]]'s [[Don Mueang International Airport]], [[Thailand]] to [[Surat Thani International Airport]] in [[Surat Thani]], Thailand. The flight was operated by [[Thai Airways|Thai Airways International]], the [[flag carrier]] of Thailand. On 11 December 1998, the aircraft, an [[Airbus]] [[Airbus A310|A310-204]] registered in Thailand as HS-TIA, stalled and crashed in a rice paddy on its landing attempt at Surat Thani Airport. A total of 101 people were killed in the crash.&lt;ref name="ASN-1998"&gt;{{cite web |title=Database-1998 |url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19981211-0 |website=Aviation Safety Network (ASN) |publisher=Flight Safety Foundation |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thailand's [[Aircraft Accident Investigation Committee]] (AAIC) opened an investigation into the accident. The investigation revealed that the crew had become disoriented. Visibility was limited. Stress caused the crew to lose control of the aircraft. The AAIC noted also Surat Thani's minimal lighting&lt;ref name="ASN-1998"/&gt; and faulty warnings to the aircraft.

==Aircraft==
HS-TIA was an [[Airbus A310-204]], c/n 415, previously registered as F-WWBI for flight testing with Airbus. Given the name ''Phitsanulok'', HS-TIA was first flown on 3 March 1986 and delivered to Thai Airways at Don Mueang on 29 April 1986.

==Nationalities==
There were 25 foreigners on board the flight including nationalities from Austria, Australia, Britain, Finland, Germany, Japan, Norway, and the United States. Among the survivors were three Australians, three Japanese, three Germans, two Israelis and one Briton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thai police stop search at crash site |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217225344/http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/121398/LA0562.shtml |accessdate=10 September 2018 |agency=AP|work=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal |date=1998-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thai plane was missing equipment |url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/121498/LA0783.shtml |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal |agency=AP |date=1998-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accident ==
Weather conditions were rainy at the time of the crash and the crew was unable to see the runway. At 19:05 local time, the aircraft was attempting to land on runway 22 for the third time following two aborted landings. The captain ordered another go-around attempt and when the pitch attitude reached approximately 48 degrees the aircraft entered an aerodynamic stall, began to lose altitude and crashed into the ground, bursting into flames. 101 of the 146 passengers and crew died at the scene. 45 were rushed to hospital.&lt;ref name="ASN-1998" /&gt;

==Investigation==
Airbus, the aircraft manufacturer, sent a team of specialists to assist Thai authorities in the crash investigation. Both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder were found by the search and rescue team and were taken from the crash site for further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Grim task over |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/233653.stm|work=BBC|date=12 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators stated that bad weather was the probable cause of the accident, without ruling out pilot error. There was a project to extend the runway at Surat Thani Airport, however the project was delayed due to an economic downturn. A Thai air force pilot stated that due to the removal of the [[Instrument landing system]] (ILS), pilots had to use a radio navigation system which was less accurate.&lt;ref name=BBC-19981213&gt;{{citeweb|title=Thai crash victims compensation offer |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/234189.stm|work=BBC|date=13 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Thai Airways International offered compensation payment to the families affected by the crash. Thai Airways International chairman, Thamnoon Wanglee, stated on a news conference that each relatives of the 101 victims of the crash would receive a compensation payment of US$100,000, while the 45 injured survivors would receive a compensation of 200,000 [[Thai baht|baht]] (US$5,600) each. The airline would pay their medical expenses.&lt;ref name=BBC-19981213/&gt;

[[File:CLAW hypothesis graphic 2 AYool.png|thumb|Schematic diagram of the anti-CLAW hypothesis (Lovelock, 2006)&lt;ref name="lovelock06"/&gt;]]

'''''The Revenge of Gaia: Why the Earth is Fighting Back – and How we Can Still Save Humanity''''' (2006) is a book by [[James Lovelock]]. Some editions of the book have a different, less optimistic subtitle: '''''Earth's Climate Crisis and the Fate of Humanity'''''.

The book introduces the concept of the [[anti-CLAW hypothesis]]. Lovelock proposed that instead of providing negative feedback in the climate system, the components of the [[CLAW hypothesis]] may act to create a [[positive feedback|positive feedback loop]].&lt;ref name="lovelock06"&gt;{{cite book | author=Lovelock, James | title=The Revenge of Gaia | publisher=Penguin | year=2007 | isbn=0-14-102597-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under future [[global warming]], increasing temperature may [[Stratification (water)|stratify]] the [[world ocean]], decreasing the supply of nutrients from the deep ocean to its [[primary production|productive]] [[euphotic zone]]. Consequently, [[phytoplankton]] activity will decline with a concomitant fall in the production of [[dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS). In a reverse of the CLAW hypothesis, this decline in DMS production will lead to a decrease in cloud condensation nuclei and a fall in cloud [[albedo]].  The consequence of this will be further climate warming which may lead to even less DMS production (and further climate warming). The figure to the right shows a summarising schematic diagram.

Evidence for the anti-CLAW hypothesis is constrained by similar uncertainties as those of the sulfur cycle feedback loop of the CLAW hypothesis.  However, researchers [[computer simulation|simulating]] future [[Primary production#Oceanic production|oceanic primary production]] have found evidence of declining production with increasing ocean stratification,&lt;ref name=cox00&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cox, P.

'''Tórshavn''' ({{IPA-fo|ˈtʰɔuʂhaʊn|lang}}; &lt;small&gt;[[Literal translation|lit.]]&lt;/small&gt; '[[Thor]]'s harbour'; {{lang-da|Thorshavn}}, {{IPA-da|ˈtoɐ̯ˀshɑwˀn|pron}}) is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] and largest town of the [[Faroe Islands]]. Tórshavn is in the southern part on the east coast of [[Streymoy]]. To the northwest of the city lies the {{convert|347|m|ft|adj=mid|-high|sp=us}} mountain [[Húsareyn]], and to the southwest, the {{convert|350|m|ft|adj=mid|-high|sp=us}} Kirkjubøreyn. They are separated by the Sandá River. The town proper has a population of 13,089 (2017), and the greater [[urban area]] a population of 21,000.

The Norse established their parliament on the [[Tinganes|Tinganes peninsula]] in AD 850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torshavn.fo/Default.aspx?pageid=620|title=Tórshavn Municipality|website=Tórshavn Municipality|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tórshavn thus became the capital of the Faroe Islands and has remained so ever since. All through the [[Middle Ages]] the narrow peninsula jutting out into the sea made up the main part of Tórshavn. Early on, Tórshavn became the centre of the islands' trade monopoly, thereby being the only legal place for the islanders to sell and buy goods. In 1856, the trade monopoly was abolished and the islands were left open to free trade.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
It is not known whether the site of Tórshavn was of interest to the Celtic monks who were [[History of the Faroe Islands|probably the first settlers]] in the Faroes.  The Viking settlers in the 9th century established their own parliaments, called ''[[Thing (assembly)|tings]]'', in different parts of the islands, it being the tradition in each case to hold the ''ting'' at a neutral and thus uninhabited place, so no one location gave anyone an advantage.  The main ''ting'' for the islands was convoked in Tórshavn in 825, on [[Tinganes]], the [[peninsula]] that divides the harbour into two parts: ''Eystaravág'' and ''Vestaravág''. The Vikings would thus meet on the flat rocks of Tinganes every summer, as the most central place on the islands, although there was no settlement at Tinganes at that time. The [[Færeyinga Saga]] says: "the place of the ''ting'' of the Faroese was on Streymoy, and there is the harbour that is called Tórshavn". The Viking age ended in 1035. The ''ting'' was followed by a market which gradually grew into a permanent trading area.

All through the [[Middle Ages]], the narrow peninsula jutting out into the sea made up the main part of Tórshavn. It belonged to the outfield of two farmers. Unlike other Faroese villages, Tórshavn was never a distinct farming community. During the 12th century, all trade between Norway and the Faroes, along with other tributary islands to the west, became centralised in [[Bergen]]. In 1271, a royal trade monopoly was established in Tórshavn by the Norwegian Crown. According to a document from 1271, two ships would sail regularly to Tórshavn from Bergen with cargoes of salt, timber and cereal. Tórshavn therefore had more contact with the outside world than did the other villages.  Under the Norwegian, and then Danish rule, government officials made Tórshavn their home. All of these things, combined with the fact that Tórshavn was the seat of the ''ting'' of the islands, influenced the town's development.

=== 1500–1800 ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
[[File:Tórshavn skansin 8.jpg|thumb|Skansin has been rebuilt several times since it was first built in 1580. The current building dates back to 1790]]

Sources do not mention a built-up area in Tórshavn until after the Protestant reformation in 1539. In ca. 1580 a small fort, [[Skansin]], was built by the Faroese naval hero and trader [[Magnus Heinason]] at the north end of the harbour. Later small fortifications were built at Tinganes.

In 1584 Tórshavn had 101 inhabitants. The population was divided into three equally large groups made up of farmers, their families and servants, trade and government officials and people who owned no land and therefore not much else; this included the landless [[proletariat]] from the villages that during this period came to Tórshavn in search of work. They were set to guard duty on Skansin without pay, and for clothing and food they depended on the bounty of the farmers.

In 1655 king [[Frederick III of Denmark]] granted the Faroe Islands to his favourite [[Politician|statesman]] [[Kristoffer Gabel]], the rule of the von Gabel Family, 1655–1709, is known as ''Gablatíðin''. It is the darkest chapter in the history of Tórshavn. Gabel's administration suppressed the islanders in various ways. The trade monopoly was in the family's hands and it was not designed for the needs of the Faroese people. People across the country brought products into town and had to be satisfied with whatever price they were given. At the same time imported goods were limited and expensive. There came considerable complaints from the islands' inhabitants of unjust treatment by the civil administration in Tórshavn. These not only included the persons in charge of the monopoly trade, but also the [[bailiff]] and others. It was during this period, in 1673, that Tinganes was ravaged by a fire after a store of gunpowder kept at Tinganes had blown up. Many old houses burnt to the ground and old Faroese records were lost as were Gabel's documents.

Conditions improved in Tórshavn when the trade monopoly became a royal monopoly in 1709. The royal monopoly was supplied with goods from [[Copenhagen]] three times a year. However, in 1709 Tórshavn was hit by a plague of smallpox, killing nearly the entire population. The town had by this time reached a population of 300 and 250 of the inhabitants died. Still, it was during the latter half of the 18th century that Tórshavn started to develop into a small town. This was while Niels Ryberg was in charge of the trade monopoly. From 1768 and during the next 20 years onwards Ryberg was allowed to carry on an entrepot trade which was mainly based on smuggling to [[England]]. Because of the French-British conflict there was room for this kind of operation. In Tórshavn his warehouses filled up with goods. Ryberg was the first person who thought of making a financial profit from fishing, which later became the most important economic factor to the islands. He experimented with salted cod and herring but at this point in time nothing much beyond this happened.

[[Tórshavn Cathedral]] was first built in 1788 and partly rebuilt in 1865. Since 1990, it has been the seat of the Bishop of the Faroe Islands (in the [[Church of the Faroe Islands]]).

=== 1800–present ===
[[File:Recherche Expedition 1839 Tórshavn.jpg|thumb|left|Tórshavn in 1839]]
On 30 March 1808, during the Anglo-Danish [[Gunboat War]], the [[Cruizer class brig-sloop]] [[HMS Clio (1807)|HMS ''Clio'']] entered Tórshavn and briefly captured the fort at Skansin. The fort surrendered without firing a shot as the landing party approached. The ''Clio'''s men  [[Touch hole#Spiking the guns|spiked]] the fort's eight 18-pounder guns and took all the smaller guns and weapons before leaving. Shortly after 6 May a German privateer who had assumed the name "Baron von Hompesch" plundered the defenceless city and seized the property of the Danish Crown Monopoly. The Admiralty Prize Court, however, refused to condemn it as a lawful prize. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
[[File:Logting 1864, faroe islands.jpg|thumb|Tórshavn in 1864, the Løgting is on top left]]
In 1856, free trade came to the Faroe Islands. By opening the islands to the world, it transformed the economy, with Tórshavn at its centre. The farming land was rented to townspeople who could later buy it if they wished.  These small plots of land enabled people to keep cows and sheep.  {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 1866, Tórshavn's town council was founded. The town has been the capital of the Faroe Islands ever since. Later, in 1909, Tórshavn became a market town with the same municipal charter as Danish market towns.

In 1927, Tórshavn had a modern harbour built. This made it possible for larger ships to berth.&lt;ref name="Gregoriussen 11-15"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gregoriussen, Jákup Pauli|year=2000|title=Tórshavn, vár miðstøð og borg II. Tekningar úr Havn|location=Velbastaður|publisher=Forlagið í Støplum|isbn=99918-914-4-7|language=fo|pages=11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[British occupation of the Faroe Islands in World War II]], Skansin was used as the headquarters of the Royal Navy Command, and two 5.5-inch guns used aboard {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} before World War II were deployed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_55-50_mk1.htm &lt;nowiki&gt;British
5.5"/50 (14 cm) BL Mark I&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the neighbouring villages [[Hoyvík]] and [[Hvítanes]] were made part of the town area. Later, even more municipalities joined the Tórshavn municipality. In 1978 Kaldbak, in 1997 Argir, in 2001 Kollafjørður, and finally in 2005, Kirkjubøur, Hestur, and Nólsoy.

== Climate ==
[[File:Tórshavn.2009.5.jpg|thumb|Tórshavn Harbour Ferry Terminal, view towards [[Tinganes]] and 'Vesturbýur' ''The Western Town'']]
Tórshavn features a [[subpolar oceanic climate]] (''Cfc'') with average summer highs around {{convert|12|C|F|abbr=on}} and average winter highs around {{convert|6|C|F|abbr=on}}, and with winter lows averaging just above freezing, and frequent cloudy skies. Average monthly precipitation is highest in autumn and winter, peaking in January, owing to frequent, intense storms crossing the area from the North Atlantic Ocean, while May and June are markedly drier months. Tórshavn is among the cloudiest places in the world, with significant sunshine records at only about 2.4 hours of sunshine per day; however, no data exists for places such as the [[Aleutian Islands]] or parts of [[Zona Austral|southern Chile]], which may have even less sun. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Because of the cloudy weather and the ice-free water surrounding Torshavn, its winter temperatures are exceptionally mild for such a northerly location. Summer temperatures are much lower than those found in continental Scandinavia on similar parallels. The temperature amplitude in the period from 1961 to 2010 is a mere {{convert|33|C-change}} between the absolute warmest and coldest temperatures.

== Politics and government ==

Tórshavn is the capital of the Faroe Islands, and as such is the seat of the Faroes’ [[Cabinet of the Faroe Islands|self rule government]]. The government holds the executive power in local government affairs. Today a part of the government is located on the [[Tinganes]] peninsula of Tórshavn, the Prime Minister's office is here and the Ministry of Internal Affairs was here until it was closed in 2013. The other ministries are located in other office buildings in various places in Tórshavn, i.e. the Ministry of Health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.government.fo/the-government/ministries/ministry-of-health-affairs/ |title=Ministry of Health Affairs |website=The government of the Faroe Islands |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711033914/http://www.government.fo/the-government/ministries/ministry-of-health-affairs/ |archivedate=2015-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ministry of Social Affairs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.government.fo/the-government/ministries/ministry-of-social-affairs/|title=Ministry of Social Affairs|website=The government of the Faroe Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt; are located near the [[Landssjúkrahúsið|Hospital of the Faroes]] in Eirargarður, and the Ministry of Finance is located in [[Argir]] in a building called Albert Hall on the street Kvíggjartún.&lt;ref name="fmr"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.government.fo/the-government/ministries/ministry-of-finance/ | title=Ministry of Finance |website=The government of the Faroe Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament, the [[Løgting]], which was originally located on Tinganes, was relocated to the town square, Vaglið, in 1856.

== Sport ==

[[File:Drekin a Faroese Row Boat.jpg|thumb|A boat race at the Jóansøka Festival in Tvøroyri in June 2011.]]

Tórshavn, as the capital city, is the centre of sport in the islands; the largest sports centre is located in the [[Gundadalur]] district of Tórshavn. Also, the largest football stadium, [[Tórsvøllur]], is located here, seating 6,000 spectators. The stadium serves as home to the [[Faroe Islands national football team]]. Around the city there are also two other football pitches, indoor tennis courts, badminton courts and a swimming pool.

The city has several football clubs, including three [[Faroe Islands Premier League|Premier League]] teams: [[HB Tórshavn]], [[B36 Tórshavn]] and [[Argja Bóltfelag]]. Other football clubs with connections to the city are [[FF Giza]] ([[Nólsoy]]), [[FC Hoyvík]] and [[Undrið FF]].  [[Team handball|Handball]] is the second most popular sport in Tórshavn. The city's handball teams are [[Kyndil]], [[Neistin]] and [[Ítróttafelagið H71]] and the [[Faroe Islands national handball team|Faroe Island's national handball team]] practice in the city. Tórshavn city has several popular [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] clubs, including, [[Havnar Róðrarfelag]] and [[Róðrarfelagið Knørrur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isf.fo/?page_id=623#51|title=ISF.fo Faroese confederation of sports and Olympic committee|work=Ítróttasamband Føroya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year in July the [[Tour of Faroe Islands]], which is a [[road bicycle race]], is held around the islands. The race is called ''Kring Føroyar'' (Tour de Faroe / Around the Faroes), it starts in [[Klaksvík]] and ends in Tórshavn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsf.fo//tour+of+faroe+island+2012.html|title=Effo Kring Føroyar (Tour de Faroe)|website=Tórshavnar súkklufelag (Bycycle club of Tórshavn)|language=fo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music ==
The Tórshavn Jazz Festival has been held annually since 1983. It attracts musicians from all over North America and Europe and has become a popular tourist event.

== Transport ==
[[File:Torshavn.png|upright|thumb|A map of Tórshavn showing road links]] 
{{See also|Transport in the Faroe Islands}}
The harbour is served by the [[Smyril Line]] international ferry service to [[Denmark]] and [[Iceland]]. The harbour is also used by domestic ferry services of [[Strandfaraskip Landsins]] within the Faroe Islands, chiefly on the route to [[Tvøroyri]].

The town is served by [[Transport in the Faroe Islands#Bus services|Bussleiðin]] - a network of local buses, with the service identified by its red livery. Tórshavn's Bussleiðin has five routes and is operated by the Tórshavn municipality. Buses within Tórshavn have been completely free of charge since 2007. This is a green initiative intended to persuade people to use public transportation rather than drive their cars. Like Bygdaleiðir, the actual buses are privately owned, but contracted to Bussleiðin. Buses also depart to villages throughout the islands.

There is a [[helipad]] in Tórshavn; the nearest airport is [[Vágar Airport]].

The '''V'''erification of the '''O'''rigins of '''R'''otation in '''T'''ornadoes '''Ex'''periment or '''VORTEX''' are field projects that study [[tornado]]es. VORTEX1 was the first time scientists completely researched the entire evolution of a tornado with an array of [[Weather instrument|instrumentation]], enabling a greater understanding of the processes involved with [[tornadogenesis]]. A violent tornado near Union City, Oklahoma was documented in its entirety by chasers of the Tornado Intercept Project (TIP) in 1973 and visual observations led to advancement in understanding of tornado structure and life cycles.&lt;ref name="intercept history"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Bluestein |first = Howard B. |author-link = |title = A History of Severe-Storm-Intercept Field Programs |journal = Wea.

The VORTEX1 project sought to understand how a tornado is produced by deploying around 18 vehicles that were equipped with customized instruments used to measure and analyze the [[weather]] around a tornado. The project has also stated that it is interested in why some [[supercell]]s, or [[mesocyclone]]s within such storms, produce tornadoes while others do not. It also concerned itself with why some supercells form violent tornadoes versus weak tornadoes.

The original project took place in 1994 and 1995, while several smaller studies, such as SUB-VORTEX and VORTEX-99, were conducted from 1996 to 2008.&lt;ref name="NSSL projs"&gt;{{cite web |title = NSSL Projects: Field Projects |work = NSSL Projects |publisher = National Severe Storms Laboratory |date = 2015 |url = http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/field/ |accessdate = 2015-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; VORTEX1 documented the entire life cycle of a tornado with significant instrumentation surrounding it for the first time.&lt;ref name="fifty"&gt;{{cite web   | title = 50 tornado experts to deploy as 'chasers' Goal is to improve twister predictions and better understand why they form  | publisher =Associated Press  | date =   | url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30092360/  | accessdate =2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severe weather warnings improved after the research collected from VORTEX1 and many believe that VORTEX1 contributed to this improvement.&lt;ref name="Six"&gt;{{cite web  | last =Meyer  | first =Travis    | title = VORTEX 2: Inside A Tornado  | work = News on Six  | publisher = WorldNow and KOTV.   | date = April 28, 2009   | url = http://www.newson6.com/global/story.asp?s=10222531  | accessdate =2009-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; “An important finding from the original VORTEX experiment was that the factors responsible for causing tornadoes happen on smaller time and space scales than scientists had thought. New advances will allow for a more detailed sampling of a storm’s [[wind]], [[temperature]] and moisture environment and lead to a better understanding of why tornadoes form –-and how they can be more accurately predicted,” said Stephan Nelson, NSF program director for physical and dynamic meteorology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Bledsoe  | first = Brian  | title = VORTEX 2 ( Tornado Research Project ) National Tornado Experiment to Begin in May  | work = KKTV  | publisher = Gray Television, Inc.  | date = April 27, 2009  | url = http://www.kktv.com/blogs/talkweather/43831942.html  | accessdate = 2009-05-11  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090503153646/http://www.kktv.com/blogs/talkweather/43831942.html  | archive-date = May 3, 2009  | dead-url = yes  | df = mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last =  Lydersen  | first = Kari   | title = Tornado-Chasing Project Aims to Improve Forecasts  | publisher = The Washington Post  | date = April 20, 2009   | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/19/AR2009041902069_2.html?wprss=rss_nation/science&amp;sid=ST2009042002281  | accessdate =2009-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

VORTEX had the capability to fly [[Doppler weather radar]] above the tornado approximately every five minutes.&lt;ref name="lydersen"&gt;{{cite web   | last =  Lydersen  | first = Kari | title = Tornado-Chasing Project Aims to Improve Forecasts  | publisher = The Washington Post  | date = April 20, 2009   | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/19/AR2009041902069_2.html?wprss=rss_nation/science&amp;sid=ST2009042002281  | accessdate = 2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VORTEX research helped the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) to provide [[tornado warning]]s to residents with a lead time of 13 minutes.&lt;ref name="BBS"/&gt; A federal research [[meteorologist]], [[Donald W. Burgess|Don Burgess]], estimates that the "false alarms" pertaining to severe weather by the National Weather Service have declined by 10 percent.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

The movie ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'' was at least partially inspired by the VORTEX project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last =Shortt  | first =Rachel   | title =Twister Movie Put NSSL on the Map    | publisher =National Severe Storms Laboratory   | date =2004-09-27   | url =http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/stories/twister.html  | accessdate =2009-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==VORTEX2==
'''VORTEX2''' was an expanded second VORTEX project with field phases from 10 May until 13 June 2009 and 1 May until 15 June 2010. VORTEX2's goals were studying why some [[thunderstorm]]s produce tornadoes while others do not, how to make more accurate and longer lead time tornado forecasts and warnings, and tornado structure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vortex2.org&lt;/ref&gt; VORTEX2 was by far the largest and most ambitious tornado study ever with over 100 scientific participants from many different universities and research laboratories.

"We still do not completely understand the processes that lead to tornado formation and shape its development. We hope that VORTEX2 will provide the data we need to learn more about the development of tornadoes and in time help forecasters give people more advance warning before a tornado strikes," said [[Roger Wakimoto]], director of the Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL) at the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] (NCAR), and a principal investigator for VORTEX2.&lt;ref name="BBS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ringer |first=Kandy |title=VORTEX2 Heads to the Great Plains to Study Often-Deadly Weather Events World's Largest Tornado Experiment Heads for Great Plains |publisher=BBSNews |date=May 10, 2009 |url=http://bbsnews.net/article.php/20090510121341852 |accessdate=2009-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514031340/http://bbsnews.net/article.php/20090510121341852 |archivedate=May 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Then you can get first responders to be better prepared&amp;mdash;police, fire, medical personnel, even power companies. Now, that's not even remotely possible," said Stephan P. Nelson, a program director in the [[atmospheric sciences]] division of the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF).&lt;ref name="lydersen"/&gt;

[[Joshua Wurman]], president of the [[Center for Severe Weather Research]] (CSWR) in [[Boulder, Colorado]] proposes, "if we can increase that lead time from 13 minutes to half an hour, then the average person at home could do something different. Maybe they can seek a community shelter instead of just going into their bathtub. Maybe they can get their family to better safety if we can give them a longer warning and a more precise warning."&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Evans  | first =  Murray  | title = $11.9 million Vortex2 study is set to launch across the Great Plains  | publisher =   Associated Press   | date = May 8, 2009   | url = http://www.enidnews.com/localnews/local_story_128222318.html  | accessdate =2009-05-11  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

VORTEX2 deployed 50 vehicles customized with mobile [[Weather radar|radar]], including the [[Doppler On Wheels]] (DOW) radars, SMART radars, the NOXP radar, a fleet of instrumented vehicles, [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s, deployable instrument arrays called Sticknet and Podnet, and mobile [[weather balloon]] launching equipment. Over 100 scientists and crew researched tornadoes and supercell thunderstorms in the "[[Tornado Alley]]" region of the United States' [[Great Plains]] between [[Texas]] and [[Minnesota]]. A number of institutions and countries were involved in the [[United States dollar|US$]]11.9&amp;nbsp;million project, including: [[Finland]], the National Weather Service, the [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology in Australia]], Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), [[Environment Canada]], universities across the United States, and the NOAA [[Storm Prediction Center]] (SPC).

The project included DOW3, DOW6, DOW7, Rapid-Scan DOW, SMART-RADARs, NOXP, UMASS-X, UMASS-W, and CIRPAS for their mobile radar contingent. The Doppler on Wheels were supplied by the Center for Severe Weather Research, and the SMART-Radars from the [[University of Oklahoma]] (OU). [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] (NSSL) supplied the NOXP radar, as well as several other radar units from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], the [[Office of Naval Research]] (ONR) and [[Texas Tech University]] (TTU). NSSL and CSWR supplied mobile [[mesonet]]s. Mobile [[radiosonde]] launching vehicles are provided by NSSL, NCAR, and the [[SUNY Oswego|State University of New York at Oswego]] (SUNY Oswego). There were quite a few other deployable state of the art instrumentation, such as Sticknets from TTU, tornado PODS from CSWR, and four [[disdrometer]]s from [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado CU]], and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] (UIUC).&lt;ref name="UCAR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="what"/&gt;

VORTEX2 technology allowed trucks with radar to be placed in and near tornadic storms and allowed continuous observations of the tornadic activity. [[Howard Bluestein]], a meteorology professor at the University of Oklahoma said, "We will be able to distinguish between rain, hail, dust, debris, flying cows."&lt;ref name="lydersen"/&gt;

Additionally, [[photogrammetry]] teams, damage survey teams, [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|unmanned aircraft]], and weather balloon launching vans helped to surround the tornadoes and thunderstorms.&lt;ref name="UCAR"&gt;{{cite web   | title = Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment 2  | publisher = UCAR   | year = 2008  | url = http://www.eol.ucar.edu/deployment/field-deployments/field-projects/vortex2/vortex-ii  | accessdate =2009-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="what"&gt;{{cite web  | coauthors =   | title = What is VORTEX2?  | publisher =   National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)   | date =   | url = http://www.vortex2.org/home/   | accessdate =2009-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment amassed enabled three dimensional [[data set]]s of the storms to be collected with radars and other instruments every 75 seconds (more frequently for some individual instruments), and resolution of the tornado and tornadic storm cells as close as {{convert|200|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="BBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flickinger"&gt;{{cite web   | last = Flickinger   | first = George   | title = VORTEX2 project takes aim at understanding tornadoes   | work = KJRH   | publisher = Scripps TV Station Group   | year = 2009   | url = http://www.kjrh.com/content/weather/tornado-alley/facts-tales/story/VORTEX2-project-takes-aim-at-understanding/FVFSB645_kClofzT2TaLuA.cspx   | accessdate = 2009-05-11   | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100127205749/http://www.kjrh.com/content/weather/tornado-alley/facts-tales/story/VORTEX2-project-takes-aim-at-understanding/FVFSB645_kClofzT2TaLuA.cspx   | archive-date = 2010-01-27   | dead-url = yes   | df =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists met May 10 and held a class which taught the crews how to launch the tornado pods which will need to be sent off within 45 seconds.&lt;ref name="Glamour"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Wurman  | first = Joshua  | title =  Glamour, Science and the Start of VORTEX2  | work =Tornado Scientists  | publisher =   | date = May 10, 2009  | url = http://tornadoscientists.blogspot.com/  | accessdate =2009-05-11  }}&lt;/ref&gt; VORTEX2 was equipped with 12 tornado PODS which were instruments mounted onto {{convert|1|m|ft|sp=us}} towers which measure wind velocity  (i.e. [[Wind speed|speed]] and [[Wind direction|direction]]). The aim was that some of the measurements be taken in the centre of the tornado.&lt;ref name="instruments"&gt;{{cite web   | title = VORTEX2 Vehicles &amp; Instruments  | publisher =NSSL   | date = 2009-05-11   | url = http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/vortex2/instruments.php  | accessdate = 2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the pods are deployed, the teams repeat the process at the next location until finally the teams return to the south of the tornado to retrieve the pods with the recorded data. The process is then repeated again. This happens within {{convert|2|mi|km}} or 4 minutes away from the tornado itself.&lt;ref name="Glamour"/&gt;

The team had 24 {{convert|2|m|ft}} high portable Sticknets which can be set up at various locations around tornado storm cells to measure wind fields, provide atmospheric readings, and record acoustically the [[hail]] and [[precipitation]].&lt;ref name="Flickinger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="instruments"/&gt;

Scientists are still seeking to refine understanding of which supercell thunderstorms which form mesocyclones will further produce tornadoes, by which processes, [[storm-scale]] interactions, and within which atmospheric environments.&lt;ref name="lydersen"/&gt;

[[File:05june-rapiddow-wide.gif|thumb|left|600px|A Doppler on Wheels radar loop of the tornado intercepted on June 5.]]
Updates on the progress of the project were posted on the [http://www.vortex2.org/ VORTEX2 home page]. The scientists also started a blog of live reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title = VORTEX2 Scientists Start Blog on Tornado Research  |work =  The National Science Foundation   |date = May 5, 2009  |url = https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=114752  |accessdate = 2009-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Even though this field phase seems to be the most spectacular and seems like it's a lot of work, by far the majority of what we're doing is when we go back to our labs, when we work with each other, when we work with our students to try to figure out just what is it that we've collected," Wurman said. "It's going to take years to digest this data and to really get the benefit of this." [[Penn State University]] will feature the public release of the initial scientific findings in the fall.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

The forecasters were determining the best probability of sighting a tornado. As the trucks traveled to [[w:Clinton, Oklahoma|Clinton, OK]] from [[Childress, Texas|Childress, TX]], they found [[mammatus cloud]]s, and [[lightning]] at sundown on May 13, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |last = Bettes  |first = Mike  |title = VORTEX2: Close but no cigar  |work = Mike Bettes On-Camera Meteorologist  |publisher = The Weather Channel Interactive, Inc.  |date = May 14, 2009  |url = http://www.weather.com/blog/weather/8_19434.html?from=TIW  |accessdate = 2009-05-14  |deadurl = yes  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090518025249/http://www.weather.com/blog/weather/8_19434.html?from=TIW  |archivedate = May 18, 2009  |df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project finally encountered its first tornado on the afternoon of June 5 when they successfully intercepted a tornado in southern [[Goshen County, Wyoming]] which lasted for approximately 25 minutes. One of their vehicles, Probe 1, suffered hail damage during the intercept. Later that evening, embedded [[The Weather Channel|Weather Channel]] reporter [[Mike Bettes]] reported that elements of VORTEX2 had intercepted a second tornado in Nebraska. Placement of the armada for this tornado was nearly ideal and it, too, was surrounded for its entire life cycle, making it the most thoroughly observed tornado in history.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6062">[[File:Hot water heat recycling unit.jpg|thumb|right|Installation of a double-walled copper-on-copper heat exchanger in a vertical section of the master drain line in a Canadian home (2007).]]
'''Water heat recycling''' (also known as '''drain water heat recovery''', '''waste water heat recovery''', '''[[greywater]] heat recovery''',{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} or sometimes '''shower water heat recovery'''{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}) is the use of a [[heat exchanger]] to [[energy recovery|recover energy]] and reuse heat from drain water from various activities such as dish-washing, clothes washing and especially showers.  The technology is used to reduce [[primary energy]] consumption for [[water heating]].

==How it works==
[[File:Waste Water Heat Recovery in the most efficient 'equal flow' configuration.png|thumb|Diagram showing how a Waste Water Heat Recovery unit can be installed into a house]]
[[File:Greywater Recycling Heat Recovery System 2.jpg|thumb|Heat Recovery schematic system within a Greywater recycling unit.]]
[[File:Greywater Recycling Heat Recovery System 1.jpg|thumb|Heat Recovery system incorporated within a Greywater recycling system.]]

The cold water that is put into a water heating device can be preheated using the reclaimed thermal energy from a shower so that the input water doesn't need as much energy to be heated before being used in a shower, dishwasher, or sink. The water entering a storage tank is usually close to 11&amp;nbsp;°C but by recovering the energy in the hot water from a bath or dishwasher, the temperature of the water entering the holding tank can be elevated to 25&amp;nbsp;°C, saving energy required to increase the temperature of a given amount of water by 14&amp;nbsp;°C. This water is then heated up a little further to 37&amp;nbsp;°C before leaving the tank and going to the average shower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drain-water Heat Recovery |url=http://www.ecohometips.com/drain-water-heat-recovery.html |publisher=Eco Home Tips |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117070551/http://www.ecohometips.com/drain-water-heat-recovery.html |archivedate=January 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When recycling water from a bath (100-150 litres) or shower (50-80 litres) the waste water temperature is circa 20-25&amp;nbsp;°C. An in-house [[greywater]] recycling tank holds 150-175 litres allowing for the majority of waste water to be stored. Utilizing a built in copper heat exchange with circulation pump the residual heat is recovered and transferred to the cold feed of a combi-boiler or hot-water cylinder, reducing the energy used by the existing central heating system to heat water.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Impact and cost==

Heating water accounts for 18% of the average household utility bill. Standard units save up to 60% of the heat energy that is otherwise lost down the drain when using the shower.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Installing a water heat recycler reduces energy consumption and thus greenhouse gas emissions and the overall energy dependency of the household.

Typical retail price for a domestic drain water heat recovery unit ranges from around $400 to $1,000 Canadian. For a regular household, water heating is usually the second highest source of energy demand.  The energy savings results in an average payback time for the initial investment of 2–10 years according to Natural Resources Canada, Canadian Center for Housing Technology and US DOE.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A 2-year independent study of waste water heat recovery systems installed into residential houses in the UK found savings of 380kWh and 500kWh per person per year.&lt;ref name="AIMC4"&gt;[http://www.aimc4.com/filelibrary/files/AIMC4-Briefing-Paper-5_final.pdf], AIMC4 study by Barratt Developments PLC, Stewart Milne Homes, and Crest Nicholson.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Recognition==

===North America===
The technology is recognized in [[Canada]] and the United States by [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] for homes,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecobuildingpulse.com/heat-recovery-systems/down-the-drain.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Energy Star]] for New Homes Canada.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===United Kingdom===
Waste water heat recovery has been independently tested by [http://www.bre.co.uk/ BRE] and can be input into [[Standard Assessment Procedure|SAP]] models to increase a buildings energy performance.

==Industrial scale and HVAC==

A [[heat pump]] can be combined with municipal sewage lines to allow a large building's [[HVAC]] system recycle the winter heat or summer cool (compared to the outside air) of water flowing out of many homes and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterworld.com/articles/print/volume-28/issue-6/editorial-features/heat-pump-systems-use-wastewater-to-lower-hvac-costs.html|title=Heat Pump Systems Use Wastewater to Lower HVAC Costs|accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reverse is also possible: heat from air conditioning and industrial [[chiller]]s can be used to pre-heat water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icscoolenergy.com/heat-recovery-systems/|title=Heat Recovery Explained by ICS Cool Energy|accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable businesses ==
One of the pioneer companies focused on waste water heat recovery for multi unit residential, commercial &amp; public buildings is [[International Wastewater Heat Exchange Systems]] &lt;ref name="nationalgeographic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/12/121211-sewage-heat-recovery/|title=Waste Wattage: Cities Aim to Flush Heat Energy Out of Sewers|publisher=news.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
