'''1999 Seattle WTO protests''', sometimes referred to as the '''Battle of Seattle''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/WTO-riots-in-Seattle-15-years-ago-5915088.php|date=November 29, 2014|title=WTO riots in Seattle: 15 years ago|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were a series of protests surrounding the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999]],  when members of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) convened at the [[Washington State Convention and Trade Center]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] on November 30, 1999. The Conference was to be the launch of a new millennial round of trade negotiations.

The negotiations were quickly overshadowed by massive and controversial street protests outside the hotels and the Washington State Convention and Trade Center. The protests were nicknamed "'''N30'''", akin to [[Carnival Against Capitalism|J18]] and similar mobilizations. The large scale of the demonstrations, estimated at no less than 40,000 protesters, dwarfed any previous demonstration in the United States against a world meeting of any of the organizations generally associated with [[economic globalization]] (such as the WTO, the [[International Monetary Fund]], or the [[World Bank]]).&lt;ref&gt;Seattle Police Department: ''The Seattle Police Department After Action Report: World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference Seattle, Washington November 29 – December 3, 1999''. p. 41.&lt;br /&gt;"Police estimated the size of this march [the labor march] in excess of 40,000."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations and planning==
Planning for the actions began months in advance and included local, national, and international organizations. Among the most notable participants were national and international [[nongovernmental organization]]s (NGOs) such as [[Global Exchange]]&lt;ref name=Bogardus&gt;Bogardus, Keven (September 22, 2004). [http://projects.publicintegrity.org/oil/report.aspx?aid=383 Venezuela Head Polishes Image With Oil Dollars: President Hugo Chavez takes his case to America's streets.] [[Center for Public Integrity]]. Retrieved February 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; (especially those concerned with labor issues, the environment, and consumer protection), labor unions (including the [[AFL-CIO]]), student groups, religion-based groups ([[Jubilee 2000]]), and [[anarchism|anarchists]] (some of whom formed a [[black bloc]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/story/348 Anarchism: Two Kinds], [[Wendy McElroy]]. About market, violence, and anarchist reject to WTO.&lt;/ref&gt;

The coalition was loose, with some opponent groups focused on opposition to WTO policies (especially those related to [[free trade]]), with others motivated by prolabor, [[anticapitalist]], or environmental agendas.  Many of the NGOs represented at the protests came with credentials to participate in the official meetings, while also planning various educational and press events. The AFL-CIO, with cooperation from its member unions, organized a large permitted rally and march from [[Seattle Center]] to [[Downtown, Seattle, Washington|downtown]].

[[File:WTO protestors, 1999 (20680767813).jpg|thumb|left|The "turtles": protestors in sea turtle costumes]]
However, others were more interested in taking [[direct action]], including both [[civil disobedience]] and acts of vandalism and property destruction to disrupt the meeting. Several groups were loosely organized together under the [[Direct Action Network]] (DAN), with a plan to disrupt the meetings by blocking streets and intersections downtown to prevent delegates from reaching the convention center, where the meeting was to be held.  The black bloc was not affiliated with DAN, but was responding to the original call for autonomous resistance actions on November 30 issued by [[Peoples Global Action|People's Global Action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nadir.org/nadir/initiativ/agp/free/seattle/n30/n30callen.htm|title=People's Global Action "November 30th, 1999-A Global Day of Action, Resistance, and Carnival Against the Capitalist System"|website=www.nadir.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the different coalitions that aligned in protest were the "teamsters and turtles" - a [[blue-green alliance#United States|blue-green alliance]] consisting of the [[teamsters]] (trade unions) and environmentalists.&lt;ref&gt;Berg, John C. 2003, Teamsters and turtles?: U.S. progressive political movements in the 21st century, Rowman &amp; Littlefield&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fsrn.org/audio/web-special-teamsters-and-turtles/5828 |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218182827/http://fsrn.org/audio/web-special-teamsters-and-turtles/5828 |archive-date=December 18, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1525/is_2_85/ai_62828674/|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|website=findarticles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a subsequent communique, they listed the particular corporations targeted, which they considered to have committed corporate crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/1999/12/10/anarchists/|title=Who were those masked anarchists in Seattle?|date=1999-12-10|work=Salon|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lead-up months===

On July 12, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that the latest United Nations Human Development report advocated "principles of performance for multinationals on labour standards, fair trade and environmental protection ... needed to counter the negative effects of globalisation on the poorest nations". The report itself argued, "An essential aspect of global governance is responsibility to people—to equity, to justice, to enlarging the choices of all".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr1999/ ''Globalization with a Human Face''] UNHDR, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, Helene Cooper of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' warned of an impending "massive mobilization against globalization" being planned for the end-of-year Seattle WTO conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalexchange.org/campaigns/wto/wsj071699.html |title=''Globalization Foes Plan to Protest WTO's Seattle Round Trade Talks'' |publisher=Globalexchange.org |accessdate=July 17, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804174410/http://www.globalexchange.org/campaigns/wto/wsj071699.html |archive-date=August 4, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Next day, the London ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' newspaper savaged the WTO and appeared to side with the organizers of the rapidly developing storm of protest:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The way it has used [its] powers is leading to a growing suspicion that its initials should really stand for World Take Over. In a series of rulings it has struck down measures to help the world's poor, protect the environment, and safeguard health in the interests of private—usually American—companies.''

"The WTO seems to be on a crusade to increase private profit at the expense of all other considerations, including the well-being and quality of life of the mass of the world's people," says Ronnie Hall, trade campaigner at Friends of the Earth International. "It seems to have a relentless drive to extend its power."&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.yahoo.com/group/StopWTORound/message/56 THE HIDDEN TENTACLES OF THE WORLD'S MOST SECRET BODY] Sunday Independent, 17 July 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On November 16, two weeks before the conference, President [[Bill Clinton]] issued Executive Order 13141—Environmental Review of Trade Agreements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=56947 |title=Presidential Executive Order 13141 |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date=November 16, 1999 |accessdate=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which committed the United States to a policy of "assessment and consideration of the environmental impacts of trade agreements" and stated, "Trade agreements should contribute to the broader goal of sustainable development."

Activists staged a spoof of Seattle's daily paper, the ''[[Post-Intelligencer]],'' on Wednesday November 24, inserting thousands of hoax editions of a four-page front-page wrap-around into piles of newspapers awaiting distribution to hundreds of street boxes and retail outlets. The spoof front-page stories were "Boeing to move overseas" (to Indonesia) and "Clinton pledges help for poorest nations".&lt;ref&gt;Parvaz D [http://www.seattlepi.com/local/pi25.shtml P-I executives not amused by protesters' parody]'' [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]], November 25, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The byline on the Boeing story attributed it to [[Joe Hill]] (a union organizer who had been executed by firing squad in Utah in 1915). On the same day, the [[International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development]] reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;developing countries have remained steadfast in their demand that developed countries honour Uruguay Round commitments before moving forward full force with new trade negotiations.

Specifically, developing countries are concerned over developed countries' compliance with agreements on market access for textiles, their use of antidumping measures against developing countries' exports, and over-implementation of the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ictsd.net/i/news/bridgesweekly/19192/ No New Issues Without Redress Of Uruguay Round Imbalances]''ICTSD ''Bridges Weekly'' Seattle 99, Vol 3 No 46, November 24, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This ominously foreshadowed the impending conflict of the [[North–South divide|North-South divide]] which was to result in the collapse of the forthcoming WTO talks.

Previous mass protests against APEC summits in Vancouver, Canada and Manila, the Philippines also provided information about globalization policies, free trade and the situation in developing countries that likely encouraged further protests to confront international economic forums.  In 1997, the APEC Canada meeting was held  at the University of British Columbia (UBC) campus on November 24 and 25 in Vancouver. Protesters on the campus and in downtown Vancouver were treated with some repressive measures by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police while they were experiencing splits among themselves on questions of tactics and the limits of civil disobedience. That mass response of a few thousand included leaders of protests previously held in Manila where APEC had held a summit  in 1996, when 10's of thousands of labor, peasant and social justice groups had marched to oppose free trade. UBC may have welcomed the filming of "Battle in Seattle" on its grounds in the light of this past. (Submitted by a witness who participated in the Vancouver anti-APEC actions and the Seattle anti-WTO actions, and referred to Wikipedia's pages on "APEC Canada 1997" and "APEC Philippines 1996".)

[[File:WTO protests.jpg|thumb|Seattle police on Union Street, during the protests]]
On the morning of Tuesday November 30, 1999, the DAN's plan was put into effect. Several hundred activists arrived in the deserted streets near the convention center and began to take control of key intersections. Over the next few hours, a number of marchers began to converge on the area from different directions. These included a student march from the north, a march of citizens of the developing world who marched in from the south and, beginning around 09:00, militant anarchists (in a formation known as a [[black bloc]]) marching down Pike Street from 6th Avenue, blockading the streets with newspaper boxes and smashing windows.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/wtohist/day2.htm|title=Day 2: November 30, 1999|website=depts.washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some demonstrators held rallies, others held teach-ins and at least one group staged an early-morning street party. Meanwhile, a number of protesters still controlled the intersections using lockdown formations.

The control of the intersections, plus the sheer numbers of protesters in the area, prevented delegates from getting from their hotels to the convention center. It also had the effect of cutting the police forces in two: the police who had formed a cordon around the convention center were cut off from the rest of the city. The police outside of the area eventually tried to break through the protesters' lines in the south.

That morning, the [[King County Sheriff's Office]] and [[Seattle Police Department]] fired [[pepper spray]], [[tear gas]] canisters, and [[stun grenade]]s&lt;ref name="BBC12299"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reynolds|first1=Paul|title=Eyewitness: The Battle of Seattle|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/547581.stm|accessdate=April 4, 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=December 2, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; at protesters at several intersections in an attempt to reopen the blocked streets and allow as many WTO delegates as possible through the blockade.&lt;ref&gt;Seattle Police Department, After-Action Report, pp. 39–40&lt;br /&gt;Draft King Country Sheriff's Office Final Report, II.H.2.&lt;br /&gt;WTO Accountability Review Committee, ''Combined Timeline of Events During the WTO Ministerial, 1999'', Tuesday, Nov. 30: 9:09&amp;nbsp;am &amp; 10 am.&lt;br /&gt;A recording of the Seattle Police Department radio channel command-5 is also available, but has a gap from 0836 to 0840.&lt;br /&gt;Highleyman, Liz, ''Scenes from the Battle of Seattle''.&lt;br /&gt;St. Clair, Jeffrey, ''Seattle Diary''.&lt;br /&gt;Gillham, Patrick F., and Marx, Gary T., ''Complexity and Irony in Policing: The World Trade Organization in Seattle''.&lt;br /&gt;de Armond, Paul, ''Netwar in the Emerald City: WTO Protest Strategy and Tactics'', pp. 216–217.&lt;/ref&gt;  At 6th Avenue and Union Street, the crowd threw objects back at the police.&lt;ref name="HL2142"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oldham|first1=Kit|last2=Wilma|first2=David|title=Essay 2142|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/2142|website=HistoryLink.org|accessdate=April 4, 2017|date=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late morning, the black bloc had swelled to 200 people and smashed dozens of shops and police cars. This seems to have set off a chain reaction of sorts, with previously nonviolent protesters throwing bottles at police and joining in the vandalism shortly before noon.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"/&gt; Some protesters tried to physically obstruct the activities of the black bloc, however, Seattle police (led by Chief Norm Stamper) did not react immediately. Protest organizers convinced Seattle police during the protest-permit process, that peaceful organizers would quell these kinds of activities.

The police were eventually overwhelmed by the mass of protesters downtown, including many who had chained themselves together and were blocking intersections. Meanwhile, the late-morning labor-organized rally and march drew tens of thousands; though the intended march route had them turning back before they reached the convention center, some ignored the marshals and joined what had become a chaotic scene downtown.

[[File:National Guard, Downtown Seattle, WTO 1999.jpg|thumbnail|left|National Guardsmen marching to their next assignment]]
At noon, the opening ceremony at the convention center was officially cancelled.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"/&gt;  It took police much of the afternoon and evening to clear the streets. Seattle mayor [[Paul Schell]] declared a state of emergency, imposed a [[curfew]], and a 50-block "[[no-protest zone]]".

=== December 1 ===

Overnight, the [[Governor]] [[Gary Locke]]  called in two [[battalions]] of [[Washington Army National Guard|National Guardsmen]], other law enforcement agencies sent support, and before daylight on Wednesday, troops and officers lined the perimeter of the no-protest zone. Police surrounded and arrested several groups of would-be protesters (and more than one bystander).  Beginning at 21:00, a major clash took place on Broadway in the vicinity of Denny Way, involving rocks, bottles, and police concussion grenades.  It did not involve a black bloc, but appears to have included local residents, although it is known that many local residents were treated as protesters, even being teargassed, despite having no part in the protests. Police called in from other cities mistook the typically crowded streets of Capitol Hill as groups of protesters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991205&amp;slug=2999667 Alex Tizon, "Monday, Nov. 29 - Saturday, Dec. 4: WTO Week" ''Seattle Times'', December 5, 1999];&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/wtohist/day3.htm|title=Day 3: December 1, 1999|website=depts.washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 500 people were jailed on Wednesday. Throughout the day, police used tear gas to disperse crowds downtown, although a permitted demonstration organized by the Steelworkers Union was held along the waterfront.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=9213|title=WTO Meeting and Protests in Seattle (1999) -- Part 2 - HistoryLink.org|website=www.historylink.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media response ==
''[[The New York Times]]'' printed an erroneous article that stated that protesters at the 1999 WTO convention in Seattle threw [[Molotov cocktail]]s at police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Christian |first=Nichole M. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/04/us/police-brace-for-protests-in-windsor-and-detroit.html?emc=rss&amp;partner=rssnyt |title=Police Brace For Protests In Windsor And Detroit |work=New York Times |date=June 4, 2000 |accessdate=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two days later, ''The New York Times'' printed a correction saying that the protest was mostly peaceful and no protesters were accused of throwing objects at delegates or the police, but the original error persisted in later accounts in the mainstream media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.de-fact-o.com/fact_read.php?id=12 |title=Origins of the Molotov Myth |publisher=De-Fact-o.com |accessdate=July 17, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804145722/http://www.de-fact-o.com/fact_read.php?id=12 |archive-date=August 4, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seattle City Council also dispelled these rumors with its own investigation findings:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The level of panic among police is evident from radio communication and from their inflated crowd estimates, which exceed the numbers shown on news videotapes. ARC investigators found the rumors of "Molotov cocktails" and sale of flammables from a supermarket had no basis in fact. But, rumors were important in contributing to the police sense of being besieged and in considerable danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofseattle.net/wtocommittee/arcfinal.pdf |title=Seattle City Council findings |format=PDF |accessdate=17 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107103808/http://www.cityofseattle.net/wtocommittee/arcfinal.pdf |archive-date=January 7, 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An article in the magazine ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'' disputed that Molotov cocktails have ever been thrown at an antiglobalization protest within the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2004/08/295733.shtml ''The Myth of Protest Violence''], [[David Graeber]]. The Nation.&lt;/ref&gt; Video shot by anarchists at Seattle does show some protesters throwing debris at police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimethinc.com/movies/bts.html ''Breaking the Spell'' (film, 1999])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i_4xEBCdys CBS ''60 Minutes'' report on Seattle WTO protests]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though media coverage of the Battle in Seattle condemned the violence of many protesters, the nature of this violence has justified its use to some people. Specifically, the violence employed was symbolic violence: that is, "acts directed toward property, not people."&lt;ref name="DeLuca&amp;Peeples"&gt;DeLuca, K., &amp; Peeples, J. (2002). From public sphere to public screen: democracy, activism, and the "violence" of Seattle. Critical Studies in Media Communication, 19 (2), 125-151.&lt;/ref&gt;
Though many still denounced the violent tactics used by protesters of the 1999 WTO meeting in Seattle,  this violence clearly resulted in increased media coverage of the event. The WTO meeting had an increase in evening news airtime from 10 minutes and 40 seconds on the first day of the meeting to 17 minutes on the first day of violence.&lt;ref name="DeLuca&amp;Peeples" /&gt; In addition, WTO coverage was the lead or second story on CNN, ABC, CBS, and NBC after violence was reported.&lt;ref&gt;(DeLuca &amp; Peeples, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after the start of violence, the meeting remained the top story on three of the four networks.&lt;ref name="DeLuca&amp;Peeples" /&gt; Though these numbers alone are telling, the media coverage of subsequent demonstrations that did not include violence by protesters shows even more the effect of violence on coverage. For example, the World Bank/International Monetary Fund (WB/IMF) meetings in the spring showed a "coverage pattern that was almost the reverse of that in Seattle" and that "suggests the crucial role of violence in garnering time on the public screen."&lt;ref name="DeLuca&amp;Peeples" /&gt; In an even more striking example of the effects of violence on media coverage, the 2001 WTO meeting in Doha, Qatar, included no reports of violence.&lt;ref name="DeLuca&amp;Peeples" /&gt; As a result, "there was absolutely no TV evening news coverage by the four major networks."&lt;ref name="DeLuca&amp;Peeples" /&gt;

This coverage did not center exclusively on the violence. Instead, details of the protesters' message and antiglobalization campaign were included along with the discussions of symbolic violence taking place.&lt;ref name="DeLuca&amp;Peeples" /&gt; DeLuca believes the violence served as a dense surface that opened viewers' and readers' minds to a whole new way of thinking about globalization and corporations' operations.&lt;ref name="DeLuca&amp;Peeples" /&gt; That is, not only was this violence contained within the familiar setting of television, and not only did it meet the criteria of being dramatic and emotional enough to warrant air time, but it also shattered preconceived notions of globalization and the practices of corporations that drive so much of America's economy.&lt;ref name="DeLuca&amp;Peeples" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
To many in North American anarchist and radical circles, the Seattle WTO riots, protests, and demonstrations were viewed as a success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indypendent.org/2011/12/05/seattle-wto-shutdown-99-to-occupy/ ''Seattle WTO Shutdown ’99 to Occupy: Organizing to Win 12 Years Later''], DAVID SOLNIT, ''The Indypendant'', Jul 26 – September 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the "Battle of Seattle", almost no mention was made of "antiglobalization" in the US media, while the protests were seen as having forced the media to report on 'why' anybody would oppose the WTO.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, Lynn, and Palmer, L. Kendall: ''Making the News: Anarchist Counter Public Relations on the World Wide Web'', p. 9.&lt;br /&gt;They state that "[t]he protests in Seattle brought attention not only to the WTO and its policies, but also to the widespread organized opposition to those policies."&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous mass demonstrations had taken place in Australia in December 1997, in which newly formed grass-roots organizations blockaded Melbourne, [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Sydney, and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] city centers.&lt;ref&gt;''Seattle Explosion: 2 Years Too Late'', Rhoderick Gates, ''Our Time'', November 31, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy over the city's response to the protests resulted in the resignation of the police chief of Seattle, [[Norm Stamper]],&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly A.C. Wilson, [http://www.seattlepi.com/local/cops071.shtml Embattled police chief resigns], ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', December 7, 1999. Accessed online May 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and arguably played a role in Schell's loss to [[Greg Nickels]] in the 2001 mayoral primary election.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Savage]], [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=2736 Paul is Dead: Norm's Resignation Ain't Gonna Save Schell's Butt], ''The Stranger'', issue of December 9–15, 1999. Accessed online May 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rick Anderson, [http://www.seattleweekly.com/2004-11-24/news/whatever-happened-to-hippie-bitch-forman.php Whatever Happened to 'Hippie Bitch' Forman?], ''Seattle Weekly'', November 24, 2004. Accessed online May 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The massive size of the protest added $3 million to the city's estimated meeting budget of $6 million, partly due to city cleanup and police overtime bills. In addition, the damage to commercial businesses from [[vandalism]] and lost sales has been estimated at $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2000/01/06/wto000106.html WTO protests hit Seattle in the pocketbook], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]], January 6, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 2004, the city of Seattle settled with 157 individuals arrested outside of the no-protest zone during the WTO events, agreeing to pay them a total of $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20040117&amp;slug=wto17m ''City to pay protesters $250,000 to settle WTO suit''] Seattle Times, January 17, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On January 30, 2007, a federal jury found that the city had violated protesters' [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] [[constitutional rights]] by arresting them without [[probable cause]] or evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apnews.myway.com//article/20070130/D8MVTIIG0.html|title=MyWay|website=apnews.myway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/301732_wto30ww.html|author=Colin McDonald|title=Jury says Seattle violated WTO protesters' rights|date=January 30, 2007|publisher=Seattle Post Intelligencer|accessdate=December 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2010 Tibetan language protest''' was a series of protests in [[Tongren County]], [[Gonghe County]] and [[Maqên County]], in [[Qinghai Province]]; [[Minzu University of China]] in [[Beijing]]; and [[Xiahe County]] in [[Gansu Province]], [[People's Republic of China]] by [[Tibetan people|ethnic Tibetan]] students over the period of October 20 through October 27, 2010.&lt;ref name="scmp1"&gt;South China Morning Post.

==Causes==
* The education policy in the Tibetan region of [[People's Republic of China]] has been of "(Adopt) [[Standard Chinese]] as a primary language of instruction, with [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] as an auxiliary language". However, the use of Tibetan language is restricted in many schools. That coupled with the low priority given to the Tibetan language in the education policy has led to dissatisfaction among the local Tibetan population.
* The local government in Qinghai pushed for a "bilingual" education in a then newly drafted educational policy, that is, only Tibetan language and English courses are to be taught in [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]], courses other than Tibetan and English were to be taught in Standard Mandarin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.sinchew-i.com/sc/node/180852?tid=2 青海千人撐藏語 - Sin Chew Daily]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://column.creaders.net/columnViewer.php?actid=289788&amp;id=297029 |title=茉莉：撑藏语－孩子们发起的文化自救 - 万维读者网 |first= |last=|work=column.creaders.net |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Guangzhou Television Cantonese controversy#July 25, 2010 mass assembly|July 25, 2010 mass assembly]], which took place in [[Guangzhou]], [[Guangdong Province]] in protest against the perceived encroachment of [[Standard Mandarin]] on [[Cantonese|Cantonese language]] may have provided inspiration and encouragement for Tibetan people to voice their dissatisfaction.

==Protests==
A range of reports from hundreds to 9000&lt;ref name="scmp1" /&gt; people were alleged to have been involved in the protest. According to a local Tibetan blogger, the head of the county’s education department drove out and assured the protesters that "their grievances would be addressed by senior officials".&lt;ref name="thestar1"&gt;Thestar.com.

==Official response==
On Oct. 29, the [[Government of Qinghai]] said these incidents reflect some misunderstandings of the bilingual education policy by [[Tibetan people]] and reiterated that "The guiding ideology and the basic principles of strengthening and improving the bilingual education is completely correct" and that "as the state is promoting the use of [[Standard Mandarin]] and [[Chinese characters]], the right of using the local minority languages by minority peoples should be sufficiently respected and protected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kanzhongguo.com/node/374985 |title=看中国 - 撑藏语游行蔓延 青海官方称有人歪曲(图) |first= |last=|work=看中国网 |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''American Society for Public Administration''' (ASPA) is a membership association of almost 10,000 professionals in the United States sponsoring conferences and providing professional services primarily to those who study the implementation of government [[policy]], [[public administration]], and, to a lesser degree, programs of [[civil society]].  Its annual conference is an important meeting for those interested in [[bureaucracy]], [[civic engagement]], [[program evaluation]], [[public management]] and other public administration topics, such as [[budgeting]] and [[budget theory]], government strategic planning, policy analysis, contract administration, personnel management, and related topics.

American Society for Public Administration was founded in 1939, following growing concerns about the management of federal government and the report of the [[Brownlow Committee]]. It was formally incorporated on September 13, 1945.&lt;ref name= corp&gt;"[http://www.ilsos.gov/corporatellc/CorporateLlcController American Society for Public Administration]". ''Corporation File Detail Report''. Illinois Secretary of State. Accessed on April 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

American Society for Public Administration sponsors the journal ''[[Public Administration Review]]'', Journal of Health and Human Services Administration, Public Budgeting and Finance, and other leading international journals related to its over 30 working membership sections (e.g., Section on Public Performance and Management, Section on Women in Public Administration, Section on the Environment and Natural Resources Administration, Section on Intergovernmental Management and Administration).

==History==
American Society for Public Administration was founded in 1939 by [[Louis Brownlow]], William E. Mosher, Donald C. Stone, [[Charles A. Beard]], [[Harold D.

American Society for Public Administration's membership declined from about 14,000 members in 1990 to 8,383 members in 2007.&lt;ref name=Plant2009/&gt;  However, during that period the Society took "steps to address its most serious issues: attracting and retaining members, dealing with structure and funding, developing a coherent mission, strengthening chapters and sections, sponsoring successful conferences, enhancing its publication offerings, and working effectively with other organizations concerned with public administration and public service."&lt;ref name=Plant2009/&gt; American Society for Public Administration membership was affected by the tendency of government to hire local governmental personnel, and the change from government provision of services to contracting to the private and non-profit sectors. However, the field of public administration is the sole academic field given the responsibility for areas ranging from government budgeting at the United States budget levels, community development throughout all localities and states in the United States, and personnel management of all United States workforces, among others.

'''Corporate statism''', '''state corporatism''', or simply '''[[corporatism]]''', is a [[political culture]] and a form of [[corporatism]] closely related to [[fascism]] whose adherents hold that the [[corporate group (sociology)|corporate group]] which is the basis of [[society]] is the [[State (polity)|state]]. The state requires all members of a particular [[economic sector]] to join an officially designated [[interest group]]. Such interest groups thus attain public status, and they participate in national [[policymaking]]. The result is that the state has great control over the groups, and groups have great control over their members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abrahamian|last2=DeBardeleben|last3=DeSipio|last4=Grindle|last5=Kew and Lewis|last6=Ross|title=Introduction to Comparative Politics|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA|page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other political cultures, societies have existed historically which exemplified corporate statism, for instance as developed by [[Othmar Spann]] and [[Benito Mussolini]].

Corporate statism most commonly manifests itself as a ruling party acting as a mediator between the workers, [[Capitalism|capitalists]] and other prominent state interests by institutionally incorporating them into the ruling mechanism. Corporatist systems were most prevalent in the mid-20th Century in Europe and later elsewhere in developing countries. According to this critique, interests, both social and economic, are so diverse that a state cannot possibly mediate between them effectively through incorporating them.{{Fact|date=April 2009}} Social conflicts go beyond incorporated dichotomies of labor and capital to include innumerable groups. Furthermore, [[globalization]] presents challenges, both social and economic, that a corporate state cannot sufficiently address because these problems transcend state borders and approaches.{{Fact|date=April 2009}} It therefore differs from [[Corporate nationalism]] in that it is a social mode of organization rather than an economic nationalism through private business corporations.

Caruana Galizia was harassed relentlessly and intimidated for her work and opinions.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The front door of her house was set on fire in 1996.&amp;nbsp;The family dog had its throat slit and was laid across her doorstep.&amp;nbsp;Years later, the neighbour's car was burned, probably in a misdirected attack.

A number of protesters who took part in the rally, also went on to the police headquarters in [[Floriana]] to call for the police commissioner’s resignation.

Asian American populations have grown significantly since the 1970s. However, they are underrepresented in several large urban areas, such as [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Dallas]] and [[Atlanta]], although in some cases, Asian Americans are concentrated in specific urban neighborhoods or [[suburb]]s of these cities.

In regions with large numbers of Asian Americans, communities have developed that are heavily or predominantly Asian. Schools in these areas may offer instruction in languages such as [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]. These communities are often given unofficial names to reflect their populations, such as [[Chinatown]], [[Little Manila]], [[Little India (location)|Little India]], [[Little Pakistan]]s, [[Koreatown]], [[Little Saigon]]s, and [[Cambodia Town]].

==Trends==
Asian Americans, on average, have higher incomes and education levels than [[White American]]s. However, they also have higher poverty rates and lower home ownership rates.&lt;ref name="Broad racial disparities persist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15704759/ |title=Broad racial disparities persist |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |accessdate=December 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, homeownership among Asian Americans has increased by twice as much as white Americans in recent years (see [[Homeownership in the United States]]). Since the majority of the Asian American population is urbanized it usually offers more access to an educational environment as well as academic supplies. With that being said, Asian Americans will tend to find better access to higher paying jobs because of their better access to resources. Also, rural settings require farm hands which will prevent children and teenagers from completing highschool and graduating with a diploma.

'''Digify''' is a [[cloud computing|cloud]]-based document security service and virtual data room that allow companies to track and protect files. Digify can be used on a [[web browser]], and apps are offered for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] devices.&lt;ref name="VB1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/07/22/share-documents-securely-with-digify-a-snapchat-for-business-content/  |title=Share documents securely with Digify, a 'Snapchat for business content' |publisher= |date=2014-08-07 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows and OS X document viewers are also available for reading highly confidential files.

==History==

Digify was founded by Augustine Lim and Loong Chee-Yuh. Lim was concerned about leakage of intellectual property and proprietary information when sharing sensitive content with another company. At the time, he found no digital solution that could protect information from redistribution or set a time limit on access after sending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=About |url=http://www.digify.com/about/ |website=Digify |accessdate=2015-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003130729/http://www.digify.com/about |archivedate=2015-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
Digify provides [[copy protection]], [[access control]] and file tracking. Users can decide how their content can be shared with others, invite others to view a shared document or photo, set them to self-destruct and track who has viewed their files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e27.co/startup/digify  |title=e27 Startup Listing - Digify |publisher=e27 |date=|accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three account types are available on Digify: Free, Professional and Business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Pricing |url=http://www.digify.com/pricing |website=Digify - Self-Destructing Files |accessdate=2015-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003222108/http://www.digify.com/pricing/ |archivedate=2015-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the type of account, Digify has features such as DWG file support, adaptive watermarking and screenshot protection. Digify works with cloud storage providers, including [[Google Drive]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]]&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=248565846 |title=Company Overview of Digify, Inc. |publisher=Bloomberg |date=|accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Box.

==Product ==
Digify copy protects the owner's information by preventing copying, printing and download. It tracks what happens to the file and who has seen it. It is also possible to revoke access to the file, or have it self-destruct.

===Self-destructing files===
Files sent via Digify can be set to self-destruct. The sender can set how long access is granted before it expires, or revoke access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Digify Gives Others Self-Destructing Temporary Access to Dropbox Files|url = http://lifehacker.com/digify-gives-others-self-destructing-temporary-access-t-1609692040|accessdate = 2015-09-29|first = Eric|last = Ravenscraft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adaptive watermarking ===
Digify features patent-pending adaptive watermarking technology, which creates a movable, fading [[watermark]] that uniquely identifies recipients of a file. This enables the whole file to be viewed without disrupting the text or images, while making it possible to identify the originator of a leak. It also increases the difficulty of extracting content even if they take screenshots on the computer or using an external camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Digify Adaptive Watermarking Prevents Screenshots and Camera Photo-taking |url=http://www.digify.com/blog/2015/7/8/prevent-screenshots-and-camera-photo-taking-with-digify-adaptive-watermarking |accessdate=2015-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151205104303/http://www.digify.com/blog/2015/7/8/prevent-screenshots-and-camera-photo-taking-with-digify-adaptive-watermarking |archivedate=2015-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encryption===
Digify encrypts files in [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES-256]], with each object assigned a unique key.&lt;ref name="PC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2048286/encryption-still-protects-data-even-from-nsa-experts-say.html |title=Encryption still protects data, even from NSA, experts say |publisher=[[PC World]] |date=2013-09-07 |accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;Shared content is only readable by the sender and receiver. Data is encrypted while in transit between a device and a recipient, and at rest on a server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tigriscapital.com.sg/tigris-capital-takes-minority-stake-secure-document-management-system-provider-digify/ |title=Tigris Capital takes minority stake in secure document management system provider Digify |publisher=Tigris Capital |date=2014-10-31 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In 2014, the company was awarded winner of the [[RSA Conference|RSA Innovation Sandbox]].&lt;ref name="e27"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://e27.co/what-winning-rsa-innovation-sandbox-2014-taught-us-digify-20150604/ | date=June 4, 2015 | title=What winning RSA Innovation Sandbox 2014 taught us: Digify}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Digify won the SVForum startup expo and SITF Awards for best startup.&lt;ref name="e27" /&gt; Digify also participated in the [[SXSW]] Interactive Innovation Awards, where it was a finalist for Security and Privacy category, and the CTIA MobileCon Cup, where it was the runner-up.&lt;ref name="e27" /&gt;

'''Discrimination based on skin color''', also known as '''colorism''' or '''shadeism''', is a form of [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] in which people are treated differently based on the social meanings attached to [[Human skin color|skin color]].&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = Trina | year = 2001 | title = Shades of Brown: The Law of Skin Color | url = | journal = Duke Law Journal | volume = 49 | issue = 1487 | pages = | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.233850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found extensive evidence of discrimination based on skin color in [[criminal justice]], [[business]], the [[Economic discrimination|economy]], [[housing]], [[health care]], [[Mass media|media]], and [[politics]] in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. Lighter skin tones are seen as preferable in many countries in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[South America]].

==Asia==

=== East and South Asia ===
In [[East Asia|East]], [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]], a preference for lighter skin is prevalent, especially in countries such as&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/05/13/asia.whitening/|title=Skin Deep: Dying to be White|date=2002-05-15|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]], [[Korea]], [[India]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=P.H.|first=Li, Eric|last2=Jeong|first2=Min, Hyun|last3=W.|first3=Belk, Russell|date=2008-01-01|title=Skin Lightening and Beauty in Four Asian Cultures|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/13415/volumes/v35/NA-35|journal=NA - Advances in Consumer Research| volume = 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2016/01/dark-what-behind-india-s-obsession-skin-whitening|title=In the dark: what is behind India’s obsession with skin whitening?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of [[skin whitening]] in East Asia dates far back to ancient times. In the ancient dynastic eras, to be light in an environment in which the sun was harsh implied wealth and nobility because those individuals were able to remain indoors while servants had to labor outside.&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White" /&gt; Ancient Asian cultures also associated light skin with feminine beauty. "Jade" white skin in Korea is known to have been the ideal as far back as the [[Gojoseon|Gojoseon era]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Japan's [[Edo period]] saw the start of a trend of women whitening their faces with rice powder as a "moral duty".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Chinese women valued a "milk white" complexion and swallowed powdered pearls towards that end.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Four out of ten women surveyed in [[Hong Kong]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[South Korea]] use a skin whitening cream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2009-03-30/skin-whitening-big-business-asia|title=Skin whitening big business in Asia|date=30 March 2009|publisher=Public Radio International}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many Asian cultures, colorism is taught to children in the form of fairy tales, just as the Grimms' fairy tales featured light-skinned princesses or maidens; Asian mythological protagonists are typically fair and depict virtue, purity, and goodness. A light complexion is equated with feminine beauty, racial superiority, and power, and continues to have strong influences on marital prospects, employment, status, and income.&lt;ref name="Verma2011"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Verma, Harsh| title=Skin 'fairness'-Culturally Embedded Meaning and Branding Implications| journal=Global Business Review| volume=12| issue=2| year=2011| pages=193–211| url=http://gbr.sagepub.com/content/12/2/193.abstract| doi=10.1177/097215091101200202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalized East Asia still retains these biases, but they are compounded by the influence of Westernized beauty ideals and media that equate whiteness with modern and urban wealth and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Framing the Bride: Globalizing Beauty and Romance in Taiwan's Bridal Industry|last=Adrian|first=Bonnie|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=0-520-23833-8|location=|pages=147–179|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacies of European colonialism in India and Pakistan also influence the modern relations between light skin and power.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

====India====

It was mistakenly thought by Western scholars that the Hindu goddess [[Kali]] represents demonic powers and ugliness and, as a dark-skinned goddess (whose name translates to "she who is black"), is therefore a demonstration of Indian colorism. This, however, was later understood to not be true, as Kali is actually traditionally viewed positively and seen as a symbol of sexuality, motherly love, violence, and [[Shakti|power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Kali/|title=Kali|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also remain plenty of examples of black being exemplified as holy as with Shiva and the most well known and popular [[Dashavatara|avatars]] of the god Vishnu, [[Krishna]] and [[Rama]]. More recently, this was understood to have been a strategy by British colonial powers to subjugate Indian civilization.

Colorism in India has also been fueled due to the events under British colonial rule, where British officials consistently demeaned dark-skinned Indians and favored light-skinned Indians for jobs over dark-skinned Indians.&lt;ref name="cmc.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cmc.edu/keck-center/asia-experts-forum/radhika-parameswaran-on-colorism-in-india|title=Radhika Parameswaran on 'colorism' in India|website=cmc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of hundreds of years of British colonial influence, remnants of the British tactics that exacerbated colorism still remain in Indian society.&lt;ref&gt;Savita Malik, The Domination of Fair Skin: Skin Whitening, Indian Women and Public Health, San Francisco State University Department of Health Education (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of colorism in India can be seen in the cosmetic industry, where "fairness" creams meant to lighten skin are popular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fairandlovely.in|title=header test|website=fairandlovely-in}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Bollywood industry, where the majority of actors and actresses hired are light-skinned, and actresses are often photoshopped to look lighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/aug/14/indias-dark-obsession-fair-skin|title=India's unfair obsession with lighter skin|first=Monisha|last=Rajesh|date=14 August 2013|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the state of [[Maharashtra]], a group of young tribal girls trained to be flight crew through a government scholarship program that aimed to empower women. The majority of girls were denied employment due to their darker skin tone. A few of those women obtained jobs, but only as out-of-sight ground crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Impact of Colorism on the Career Aspirations and Career Opportunities of Women in India|journal=[[Advances in Developing Human Resources]]|volume=18|issue=I|pp=38–53|doi=10.1177/1523422315616339|year=2015 | last1 = Sims | first1 = Cynthia | last2 = Hirudayaraj | first2 = Malar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pakistan ====
Skin-lightening creams are popular in Pakistan, especially among women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thetempest.co/2016/04/20/social-justice/colorism-was-the-bane-of-my-existence/|title=Colorism ruined my life growing up in Pakistan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many ads feature light-skin models in good light while portraying dark-skinned models poorly.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/mmw/2013/01/pakistan-a-country-of-one-color/|title=Pakistan: A Country of One Color?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bollywood, which largely features light skinned Indian actors, is also influential among Pakistanis.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

==== Sri Lanka ====
Fair skin is a beauty ideal in contemporary Sri Lankan society but has its roots in ancient Sri Lankan beauty ideals. Fairness products and other products that include whitening agents are commonly sold in Sri Lanka and are popular among females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Fair-skin-obsession-An-inferiority-complex-that-needs-treatment-123403.html|title=Fair  skin  obsession: An inferiority complex that needs treatment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fair skinned actors and actresses feature prominently in [[Bollywood]] films and [[Korean drama]]s both of which are widely popular and influential in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hrpub.org/journals/article_info.php?aid=1850|title=How the Korean Soap Opera Influence Sri lankan’s Life|first=Shyama|last=Jinasena|date=1 September 2014|publisher=|journal=International Journal of Human Movement and Sports Sciences|volume=2|issue=5|doi=10.13189/saj.2014.020502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://djedpress.com/2018/07/31/unfairandlovely-in-sri-lanka/|title=When Fair isn’t fair and Lovely isn’t lovely in Sri Lanka - Djed|date=31 July 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== China and Japan ====
Hiroshi Wagatsuma writes in [[Daedalus (journal)|''Daedalus'']] that Japanese culture has long associated [[Human skin color|skin color]] with other physical characteristics that signify degrees of spiritual refinement or of primitiveness.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;
{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
The scholar repeats an old Japanese proverb: "white skin makes up for seven defects."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; More specifically for a woman, very light skin allows people to overlook her lack of other desired physical characteristics.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Skin color has and continues to influence attractiveness and socioeconomic status and capability.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

People in the western hemisphere have long characterised east Asians, specifically Chinese and Japanese people, as "yellow", but the Chinese and Japanese seldom describe their skin color in that way.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The Japanese traditionally used the word ''shiroi'' – meaning "white" – to describe the lighter shades of skin in their society.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The court ladies of Japan during the [[Nara period]] from 710 to 793 AD applied a large amount of white powder to the face and added red rosy cheeks.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Many references to plump women with [[White Skin|white skin]] appear in both drawings and writings from 794–1186 AD.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In literature, note for example ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (written {{circa}} 1000–1012) by [[Murasaki Shikibu|Lady Murasaki]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Malaysia ====
A survey concluded that three quarters of Malaysian men thought their partners would be more attractive if they had lighter skin complexions.&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White" /&gt;

In certain Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, a common beauty ideal is the "[[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian look]]" known locally in Malaysia as the "pan-Asian look" is an ideal that stems from the beauty ideal of fair skin, which Eurasians tend to naturally possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1053286/miss-universe-malaysia-pageant-contestants-look-too-western|title=Miss Universe Malaysia pageant contestants 'look too western'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overuse of pan-Asian faces on billboards and on television screens has been a controversial issue in the country. The issue was highlighted in 2009 when [[Zainuddin Maidin]], a Malaysian politician, called for the reduction of pan-Asian faces which he claimed dominate TV and billboards and instead increase the number of Malay, Chinese and Indian faces on local television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2007-02/09/content_805345.htm|title=Malaysian ads move triggers industry row|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the controversy surrounding the preference for Malaysians who are of mixed Asian (Malay, Chinese or Indian) and European descent who possess features such as fair skin, some experts in the industry have said the use of pan-Asian faces can be used to promote the racial diversity of Malaysians. They can also be used to promote a product towards a diverse racial demographic because of their mixed appearance, which the Minister of Information had suggested in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqIzh1StFiwC&amp;pg=PA153|title=Buying and Believing: Sri Lankan Advertising and Consumers in a Transnational World|first=Steven|last=Kemper|date=1 May 2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==
In many parts of Africa, women with lighter skin are thought to be more beautiful and likely to find more success than women of darker skin tones.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-20444798]&lt;/ref&gt; Often times this barrier leads to women turning to skin lightening treatments, many of which are harmful to the body.

Historically, the cause of skin lightening goes back to colonialism, where individuals with lighter skin received greater privilege than those of darker tones.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;[http://resolver.ebscohost.com.libdb.njit.edu:8888/openurl?sid=EBSCO%3aaph&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=20389922&amp;ISBN=&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=2&amp;date=20160701&amp;spage=67&amp;pages=67-70&amp;title=Journal+of+Public+Health+in+Africa&amp;atitle=Fifty+shades+of+African+lightness%3a+a+bio-psychosocial+review+of+the+global+phenomenon+of+skin+lightening+practices.&amp;aulast=Jacobs%2c+Meagan&amp;id=DOI%3a10.4081%2fjphia.2016.552&amp;site=ftf-live]&lt;/ref&gt; This built a racial hierarchy and color ranking within colonized African nations, leaving psychological effects on many of the darker skinned individuals.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

Colorism affects both women and men in African countries, but it has taken hold of the beauty standards associated with a woman’s ability to find success and marriage. The number of women across African countries using bleaching products have gone up with 77% of Nigerian women, 52% of Senegalese women, and 25% of Mali women using lightening products.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

===History===
[[European colonialism]] created a system of [[white supremacy|racial hierarchy]] and race-based [[ideology]], which had led to a structure of domination that privileged whites over blacks. Biological differences in skin color were used as a justification for the enslavement and oppression of Africans and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]; developing a social hierarchy that placed whites at the top and blacks at the bottom, with the exception of "[[white trash]]", who were considered lower than blacks. Slaves with lighter complexion were allowed to engage in less strenuous tasks, like domestic duties, while the darker slaves participated in hard labor, which was more than likely outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hill | first1 = Mark E | year = 2002 | title = Skin Color and the Perception of Attractiveness Among African Americans: Does Gender Make a Difference? | url = | journal = Social Psychology Quarterly | volume = 65 | issue = 1| pages = 77–91 | doi=10.2307/3090169| jstor = 3090169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; African American with a partial white heritage were seen to be smarter and superior to dark-skinned blacks, giving them broader opportunities for education and the acquisition of land and property.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, K., Wilson, M., &amp; Hall, R. (1993). The color complex: The politics of skin color among African Americans. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Colorism was a device used by the white colonist in order to create a division between the Africans and further the idea that being as close to white as possible was the ideal image. One of the first forms of colorism was the white slave owners deciding that only the light skinned slaves would work in the house while the darker ones were subjected to the harsh conditions of the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fultz|first=Lauren|date=Summer 2017|title=THE PSYCHO-SOCIAL IMPACT OF COLORISM AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN: CROSSING THE DIVIDE|url=http://corescholar.libraries.wright.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1909&amp;context=etd_all|journal=Psychology Commons|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a clear division between the slaves There were tests to determine who was light enough to work in the house and sometimes get special privileges. One of these tests was the [[Brown Paper Bag Test|brown paper bag test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/question/2014/february.htm|title=Brown Paper Bag Test - 2014 - Question of the Month - Jim Crow Museum - Ferris State University|website=ferris.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person's skin was darker than a brown paper bag, they were deemed too dark to work in the house. The skin tests were not just used by white people trying to differentiate between black people, but also by the black people themselves. In addition to the bag test, the comb test and the door test were also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://askmeaboutmyhair.com/testing-blackness/|title=Testing Blackness - Ask Me About My Hair (.com)|date=2014-02-10|work=Ask Me About My Hair (.com)|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comb test was used to measure the kinkiness of the persons hair. The objective was for the comb to be able to pass through the hair without stopping. The door test was very popular at some African American clubs and churches. The people in charge would paint the door a certain shade of brown, similar to the bag test, and if you were darker than the door, you were not allowed admittance into the establishment. These tests were used to measure what level of "blackness" was and was not acceptable for the world. Because the lighter slaves were allowed to work in the house, they were more likely to be educated than the darker slaves.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} This birthed the stereotype that dark people were stupid and ignorant.

Analysis of more than 20 million traffic stops in North Carolina showed that blacks were more than twice as likely as whites to be pulled over by police for traffic stops, and that blacks were more likely to be searched following the stop. There were no significant difference in the likelihood that Hispanics would be pulled over, but Hispanics were much more likely to be searched following a traffic stop than whites. When the study controlled for searches in high-crime areas, it still found that police disproportionately targeted black individuals. These racial disparities were particularly pronounced for young men.

The phrase "brown paper bag test," also known as a [[paper bag party]], along with the "ruler test" refers to a ritual once practiced by certain African-American sororities and fraternities who would not let anyone into the group whose skin tone was darker than a paper bag.&lt;ref name="Kerr"&gt;Kerr, A. E. (2006). The paper bag principle: Class, colorism, and rumor in the case of black Washington, DC. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spike Lee]]'s film ''[[School Daze]]'' satirized this practice at historically black colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;Spike Lee, "School Daze," 40 Acres &amp; A Mule Filmworks, Columbia Pictures Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the "paper bag test," guidelines for acceptance among the lighter ranks included the "comb test" and "pencil test," which tested the coarseness of one's hair, and the "flashlight test," which tested a person's profile to make sure their features measured up or were close enough to those of the Caucasian race.&lt;ref name="Kerr" /&gt;

A 2016 study in the journal ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]'' found that blacks and Hispanics were systemically underrepresented in education-programs for gifted children where teachers and parents referred students to those programs; when a universal screening program based on IQ was used to refer students, the disparity was reduced significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Card|first=David|last2=Giuliano|first2=Laura|date=2016-11-29|title=Universal screening increases the representation of low-income and minority students in gifted education |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=113|issue=48|pages=13678–13683|doi=10.1073/pnas.1605043113|issn=0027-8424|pmid=27856741|pmc=5137751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skin color discrimination in education affects individuals in different ways depending on gender. This may be due to the disparity in standards of attractiveness, to which women are held much more closely than men. White women, previously thought to be in a group that did not experience discrimination based on skin color, have been shown to be affected by this inequality. A 2013 study used [[spectrophotometer]] readings to quantify skin color of respondents. White women experience discrimination in education, with those having darker skin graduating from college at lower rates than those with lighter skin. This precise and repeatable test of skin color revealed that white women experience skin color discrimination in education at levels consistent with African-Americans. White men are not affected in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Branigan|first1=Amelia|last2=Freese|first2=Jeremy|last3=Patir|first3=Assaf|last4=McDade|first4=Thomas|last5=Liu|first5=Kiang|last6=Kiefe|first6=Catarina|title=Skin color, sex, and educational attainment in the post-civil rights era|journal=Social Science Research|date=November 2013|volume=42|issue=6|pages=1659–1674|pmid=24090859|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.07.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 ProPublica analysis found that African Americans and Native Americans were underrepresented in clinical trials for new drugs. Fewer than 5% of patients were African-American, even though they make up 13.4% of the total US population. African-Americans were even underrepresented in trials involving drugs intended for diseases that disproportionately affect African-Americans. As a result, African-Americans who had exhausted all other treatments have weaker access to experimental treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/black-patients-miss-out-on-promising-cancer-drugs|title=Black Patients Miss Out On Promising Cancer Drugs — ProPublica|date=2018-09-19|website=ProPublica|language=en-us|others=Caroline Chen,Riley Wong|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 meta-analysis found extensive evidence of racial discrimination in the American housing market.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Minority applicants for housing needed to make many more enquiries to view properties.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Geographical steering of African-Americans in US housing remained significant.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A 2003 study finds "evidence that agents interpret an initial housing request as an indication of a customer's preferences, but also are more likely to withhold a house from all customers when it is in an integrated suburban neighborhood ([[redlining]]). Moreover, agents' marketing efforts increase with asking price for white, but not for black, customers; blacks are more likely than whites to see houses in suburban, integrated areas ([[Racial steering|steering]]); and the houses agents show are more likely to deviate from the initial request when the customer is black than when the customer is white. These three findings are consistent with the possibility that agents act upon the belief that some types of transactions are relatively unlikely for black customers (statistical discrimination)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ondrich|first=Jan|last2=Ross|first2=Stephen|last3=Yinger|first3=John|date=2003-11-01|title=Now You See It, Now You Don't: Why Do Real Estate Agents Withhold Available Houses from Black Customers?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1162/003465303772815772|journal=Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=85|issue=4|pages=854–873|doi=10.1162/003465303772815772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 paper by Troesken and Walsh found that pre-20th century cities "created and sustained residential segregation through private norms and vigilante activity." However, "when these private arrangements began to break down during the early 1900s" whites started "lobbying municipal governments for segregation ordinances."

===Media===
A 2017 report by Travis L. Dixon (of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) found that major media outlets tended to portray black families as dysfunctional and dependent while white families were portrayed as stable. These portrayals may give the impression that poverty and welfare are primarily black issues. According to Dixon, this can reduce public support for social safety programs and lead to stricter welfare requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/13/news-media-offers-consistently-warped-portrayals-of-black-families-study-finds/|title=News media offers consistently warped portrayals of black families, study finds|last=Jan|first=Tracy|date=2017-12-13|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://colorofchange.org/dangerousdistortion/|title=Report: A Dangerous Distortion of our Families|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans possessing lighter skin complexion and "European features," such as lighter eyes, and smaller noses and lips have more opportunities in the media industry. For example, film producers hire lighter-skinned African Americans more often, television producers choose lighter skinned cast members, and magazine editors choose African American models that resemble European features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodard | first1 = K | year = 2000 | title = Traumatic Shame: Toni Morrison, Televisual Culture, and the Cultural Politics of the Emotions | url = | journal = Cultural Critique | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 210–240 | doi=10.2307/1354414| jstor = 1354414 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the magazine industry, African American women are rarely showcased in the most popular magazines.[https://cornerstone.lib.mnsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1437&amp;context=etds] Therefore, African American girls have difficultly identifying with the models showcased in these magazines, because they do not represent the type of women that they come into contact with in their own communities. Recent studies have indicated that the number of racially biased advertisements in magazines have increased over the years. A content analysis conducted by Scott and Neptune (1997) shows that less than one percent of advertisements in major magazines featured African American models. When African Americans did appear in advertisements they were mainly portrayed as athletes, entertainers or unskilled laborers. In addition, seventy percent of the advertisements that features animal print included African American women. Animal print reinforces the stereotypes that African Americans are animalistic in nature, sexually active, less educated, have lower income, and extremely concerned with personal appearances.&lt;ref name=Pious&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pious | first1 = Scott | last2 = Neptune | first2 = Dominique | year = 1997 | title = Racial and Gender Biases in Magazine Advertising: A Content-Analytic Study | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 627–644 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00135.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning African American males in the media, darker skinned men are more likely to be portrayed as violent or more threatening, influencing the public perception of African American men. Since dark-skinned males are more likely to be linked to crime and misconduct, many people develop preconceived notions about the characteristics of black men.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1995|title=The bleaching syndrome: African American's response to cultural domination vis-A-vis skin color|url=|journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=26|issue=2|pages=172–184|doi=10.1177/002193479502600205|last1=Hall|first1=R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorism was and still is very much evident in the media. An example of this is shown in the [[minstrel show]]s that were popular during and after slavery. Minstrel shows were a very popular form of theater that involved white and black people in black face portraying black people while doing demeaning things. The actors painted their faces with black paint to and over lined their lips with bright red lipstick to exaggerate and make fun of black people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/jackson/minstrel/minstrel.html|title=The Minstrel Show|website=chnm.gmu.edu|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When minstrel shows died out and television became popular, black actors were rarely hired and when they were, they had very specific roles. These roles included being servants, slaves, idiots, and criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Punyanunt|first=Narissa|date=|title=The Perceived Realism of African American Portrayals on Television|url=|journal=The Howard Journal of Communications|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; White people wanted to keep this narrative going that black people were forever in debt to them because they essentially rescued blacks from themselves and made them humans instead of savages. This is seen in the "mammy" role that black women often played. The highlights of this role included black women being the loyal servant to the master and taking care of and loving his kids more than her own. Even though black people were allowed to be on TV, they still couldn't be too black. They had to pass the color tests and if they were dark, they were usually playing a humiliating role. That trend is something that follows into present day especially for women.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} There is a huge absence of dark black women in the media and when they are shown, they are typically portraying the angry black woman stereotype but have a light skinned character to balance them out. Darker women are rarely the protagonist that isn't troubled by drugs, or caught up in the legal system. There is also a large absence of representation of dark women in the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://colorismhealing.org/colorism-in-hip-hop/|title=Colorism in Hip Hop: Keeping it Real|last=Webb|first=Sarah|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object of affection in music videos are women who could have easily passed the paper bag test and many entertainers have gone on record saying that they don't girls who are too dark and that they only prefer light or white women.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conrad|first=Kate|last2=Dixon|first2=Travis L.|last3=Zhang|first3=Yuanyuan|date=2009-02-27|title=Controversial Rap Themes, Gender Portrayals and Skin Tone Distortion: A Content Analysis of Rap Music Videos|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08838150802643795?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|language=en|volume=53|issue=1|pages=134–156|doi=10.1080/08838150802643795|issn=0883-8151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
A 2011 study found that white state legislators of both political parties were less likely to respond to constituents with African-American names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Daniel M.|last2=Broockman|first2=David E.|date=2011-07-01|title=Do Politicians Racially Discriminate Against Constituents?

Some research suggests that white voters' voting behavior is motivated by racial threat. A 2016 study, for instance, found that white Chicago voters' turnout decreased when public housing was reconstructed and 25,000 African Americans displaced. This suggest that white voters' turnout decreased due to not living in proximity to African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enos|first=Ryan D.|date=2016-01-01|title=What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior |journal=American Journal of Political Science|language=en|volume=60|issue=1|pages=123–142|doi=10.1111/ajps.12156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voter ID laws in the United States|Voter ID laws]] have brought on accusations of racial discrimination. In a 2014 review by the [[Government Accountability Office]] of the academic literature, three studies out of five found that voter ID laws reduced minority turnout whereas two studies found no significant impact.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-634|title=Elections: Issues Related to State Voter Identification Laws [Reissued on February 27, 2015]|website=www.gao.gov|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disparate impact may also be reflected in access to information about voter ID laws. A 2015 experimental study found that election officials queried about voter ID laws are more likely to respond to emails from a non-Latino white name (70.5% response rate) than a Latino name (64.8% response rate), though response accuracy was similar across groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Ariel R.|last2=Nathan|first2=Noah L.|last3=Faller|first3=Julie K.|date=2015-02-01|title=What Do I Need to Vote?

A 2012 study in the city of Boston found that black and Hispanic voters were more likely to be asked for ID during the 2008 election. According to exit polls, 23% of whites, 33% of blacks, and 38% of Hispanics were asked for ID, though this effect is partially attributed to black and Hispanics preferring non-peak voting hours when election officials inspected a greater portion of IDs. Precinct differences also confound the data as black and Hispanic voters tended to vote at black and Hispanic-majority precincts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobb|first=Rachael V.|last2=Greiner|last3=James|first3=D.|last4=Quinn|first4=Kevin M.|date=2010-06-14|title=Can Voter ID Laws Be Administered in a Race-Neutral Manner?

Research by University of Oxford economist Evan Soltas and Stanford political scientist David Broockman suggests that voters act upon racially discriminatory tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soltas|first=Evan|last2=Broockman|first2=David E.|date=2017-02-23|title=Taste-Based Discrimination Against Nonwhite Political Candidates: Evidence from a Natural Experiment|ssrn=2920729}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 study in ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]'' found that whites, in particular those who had racial resentment, largely attributed Obama's success among African-Americans to his race, and not his characteristics as a candidate and the political preferences of African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=David C.|last2=Davis|first2=Darren W.|title=The Racial Double Standardattributing Racial Motivations in Voting Behavior|url=https://academic.oup.com/poq/advance-article/doi/10.1093/poq/nfx050/4885370|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=82|pages=63|language=en|doi=10.1093/poq/nfx050|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 study in the journal ''[[American Politics Research]]'' found that white voters tended to misperceive political candidates from racial minorities as being more ideologically extreme than objective indicators would suggest; this adversely affected the electoral chances for those candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2018|title=Too Liberal to Win?

A 2018 study found evidence of racial-motivated reasoning as voters assessed President [[Barack Obama]]'s economic performance. The study found that "Whites attributed more responsibility to Obama under negative economic conditions (i.e., blame) than positive economic conditions (i.e., credit)... Whites attributed equal responsibility to the President and governors for negative economic conditions, but gave more responsibility to governors than Obama for positive conditions. Whites also gave governors more responsibility for state improvements than they gave Obama for national ones."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=David C.|last2=Davis|first2=Darren W.|date=2018|title=Appraisals of President Obama's economic performance: Racial resentment and attributional responsibility|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0261379418300362|journal=Electoral Studies|volume=55|pages=62–72|doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2018.08.002|issn=0261-3794|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study examining "all 24 African American challengers (non-incumbents) from 2000 to 2014 to white challengers from the same party running in the same state for the same office around the same time" found "that white challengers are about three times more likely to win and receive about 13 percentage points more support among white voters.

===Beauty===
Studies have shown that due to societal influences, people associate beauty with lighter skin.

Ebb Cade was born on 17 March 1890 in [[Macon County, Georgia]], the son of Evens and Carrie Cade. Ebb Cade was married to Ida Cade. At the age of 63, Cade died as a result of ventricular fibrillation followed by heart failure on 13 April 1953 in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], [[Guilford County, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author=North Carolina State Board of Health |date=27 April 1953 |title=Ebb Cade.

==Plutonium Injection Experiments==
On 23 March 1945 Cade was on his way to work at a construction site for the [[Manhattan Project]] when he was involved in a traffic accident at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].  He was an African American cement worker for the [[J.A. Jones Construction Company]]. Cade presented at the Oak Ridge Hospital with fractures of right [[patella]], right [[radius]] and [[ulna]] and left [[femur]]. A Dr.Friedell determined that as  Mr. Cade was as he characterized, a "well developed..well nourished" "colored male", he was suitable for experimentation with plutonium injection. Doctors left his fractures untreated for 20 days until after plutonium injections began on April 10 1945. Mr. Cade received the injections at the Oak Ridge Hospital on the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] reservation at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] without his assent or knowledge. He became known as HP-12 (Human Product-12), and was the first person to be injected with [[Pu-239]].&lt;ref&gt;Openness, DOE. (June 1998). Human Radiation Experiments: ACHRE Report.

Beginning in 1945 and until 1947 a total of 18 people were part of a series of studies that involved the [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] of [[Plutonium]]. In [[Rochester, New York]] at [[Strong Memorial Hospital]] 11 people were injected. In [[Chicago, Illinois]] 3 individuals received injections at Billings Hospital of the [[University of Chicago]]. In [[San Francisco, California]] 3 people were injected at the University Hospital of the University of California, San Francisco.

{{Elections}}
An '''election''' is a formal [[Group decision-making|group decision-making]] process by which a population chooses an individual to hold [[Public administration|public office]].&lt;ref name = Brit&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/182308/election "Election (political science),"] Encyclopedia Britanica Online. Retrieved 18 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern [[representative democracy]] has operated since the 17th century.&lt;ref name = Brit/&gt; Elections may fill offices in the [[legislature]], sometimes in the [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[judiciary]], and for [[local government|regional and local government]]. This process is also used in many other private and [[business]] organizations, from clubs to [[voluntary association]]s and [[corporation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Robert's Rules of Order]] Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 438–446|edition = 11th|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic [[archetype]], ancient [[History of Athens|Athens]], where the Elections were considered an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] institution and most political offices were filled using [[sortition]], also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot.&lt;ref&gt;Headlam, James Wycliffe (1891). Election by Lot at Athens. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electoral reform]] describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems. [[Psephology]] is the study of results and other [[statistics]] relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results).

To ''elect'' means "to choose or make a decision", and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as [[referendum]]s are referred to as elections, especially in the United States.

==History==
{{see also|History of democracy}}
[[File:Roman Election.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roman coin]] depicting election]]
[[File:Cardiganshire Election ballot paper 1880.jpg|thumb|A British election ballot paper, 1880]]
Elections were used as early in history as [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], and throughout the Medieval period to select rulers such as the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (see [[imperial election]]) and the [[pope]] (see [[papal election]]).&lt;ref name = Brit/&gt;

In [[Vedic period]] of India, the ''[[Raja]]'' (chiefs) of a ''[[gana]]'' (a tribal organization) was apparently elected by the ''gana''. The R''aja'' belonged to the noble [[Kshatriya]] [[varna in Hinduism|varna]] (warrior class), and was typically a son of the previous R''aja''. However, the ''gana'' members had the final say in his elections.&lt;ref name="Robinson1997"&gt;{{cite book |author=Eric W.

After the election the votes were taken out and counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Agananooru|last=|first=|publisher=Saiva Siddantha Noor pathippu Kazhagam|year=1968|isbn=|location=Chennai|pages=183–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Pala Empire|Pala]] King [[Gopala (Pala king)|Gopala]] (ruled c. 750s–770s CE) in early medieval [[Bengal]] was elected by a group of feudal chieftains.

This was known as the ''Kudavolai'' system.&lt;ref name="VKA_2010"&gt;{{cite book |title=Indian History |editor=VK Agnihotri |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MazdaWXQFuQC&amp;pg=SL2-PA62 |publisher=Allied |isbn=978-81-8424-568-4 |year=2010 |edition=26th |pages=B-62–B-65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tnsec.tn.nic.in/historical/Pre%20Independence.html |title=Pre-Independence Method of Election|date= |work= |publisher=Tamil Nadu State Election Commission, India|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern "election", which consists of public elections of government officials, didn't emerge until the beginning of the 17th century when the idea of [[representative government]] took hold in North America and Europe.&lt;ref name = Brit/&gt;

Questions of [[suffrage]], especially suffrage for minority groups, have dominated the history of elections. Males, the dominant cultural group in North America and Europe, often dominated the [[:wikt:electorate|electorate]] and continue to do so in many countries.&lt;ref name = Brit/&gt; Early elections in countries such as the [[Elections in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and [[Elections in the United States|the United States]] were dominated by [[landed gentry|landed]] or [[ruling class]] males.&lt;ref name = Brit/&gt; However, by 1920 all Western European and North American democracies had universal adult male suffrage (except Switzerland) and many countries began to consider [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref name = Brit/&gt; Despite legally mandated universal suffrage for adult males, political barriers were sometimes erected to prevent fair access to elections (see [[civil rights movement]]).&lt;ref name = Brit/&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Suffrage===
The question of who may vote is a central issue in elections. The electorate does not generally include the entire population; for example, many countries prohibit those who are under the age of majority from voting, all jurisdictions require a minimum age for voting. 

In Australia Aboriginal people were not given the right to vote until 1962 (see [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum entry]]) and in 2010 the federal government removed the rights of prisoners to vote (a large proportion of which are Aboriginal Australians).

Suffrage is typically only for citizens of the country, though further limits may be imposed.

However, in the European Union, one can vote in municipal elections if one lives in the municipality and is an EU citizen; the nationality of the country of residence is not required. 
[[File:ElezioneMilano.jpg|thumb|right|Campaigners working on posters in [[Milan]], Italy, 2004]]
In some countries, voting is required by law; if an eligible voter does not cast a vote, he or she may be subject to punitive measures such as a fine. In Western Australia, the penalty for a first time offender failing to vote is a $20.00 fine, which increases to $50.00 if the offender refused to vote prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elections.wa.gov.au/vote/failure-vote|title=Failure to Vote {{!}} Western Australian Electoral Commission|website=www.elections.wa.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nomination===
A [[representative democracy]] requires a procedure to govern nomination for political office. In many cases, nomination for office is mediated through [[preselection]] processes in organized political parties.&lt;ref&gt;Reuven Hazan, 'Candidate Selection', in Lawrence LeDuc, Richard Niemi and Pippa Norris (eds), ''Comparing Democracies 2'', Sage Publications, London, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-partisan systems tend to differ from partisan systems as concerns nominations. In a [[direct democracy]], one type of [[non-partisan democracy]], any eligible person can be nominated. Although elections were used in ancient Athens, in Rome, and in the selection of popes and Holy Roman emperors, the origins of elections in the contemporary world lie in the gradual emergence of representative government in Europe and North America beginning in the 17th century. In some systems no nominations take place at all, with voters free to choose any person at the time of voting—with some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirement—in the jurisdiction. In such cases, it is not required (or even possible) that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons, though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some first-hand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels (i.e., among the elected delegates).

As far as partisan systems, in some countries, only members of a particular party can be nominated (see [[one-party state]]).  Or, any eligible person can be nominated through a process; thus allowing him or her to be listed.

===Electoral systems===
Electoral systems are the detailed constitutional arrangements and [[voting system]]s that convert the vote into a political decision. The first step is to tally the votes, for which various [[vote counting systems]] and [[ballot]] types are used. Voting systems then determine the result on the basis of the tally. Most systems can be categorized as either [[Proportional representation|proportional]] or [[majoritarian]].  Among the former are [[party-list proportional representation]] and [[additional member system]].  Among the latter are [[First Past the Post electoral system]] (relative majority) and [[absolute majority]].  Many countries have growing electoral reform movements, which advocate systems such as [[approval voting]], [[single transferable vote]], [[Instant-runoff voting|instant runoff voting]] or a [[Condorcet method]]; these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods.

While openness and [[accountability]] are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system, the act of casting a vote and the content of a voter's ballot are usually an important exception.  The [[secret ballot]] is a relatively modern development, but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections, as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation.

===Scheduling===
The nature of democracy is that elected officials are accountable to the people, and they must return to the voters at prescribed intervals to seek their [[mandate (politics)|mandate]] to continue in office. For that reason most democratic constitutions provide that elections are held at fixed regular intervals. In the United States, elections for public offices are typically held between every two and six years in most states and at the federal level, with exceptions for elected judicial positions that may have longer terms of office. There is a variety of schedules, for example presidents: the [[President of Ireland]] is elected every seven years, the [[President of Russia]] and the [[President of Finland]] every six years, the [[President of France]] every five years, [[President of the United States]] every four years.

Pre-determined or fixed election dates have the advantage of fairness and predictability. However, they tend to greatly lengthen campaigns, and make [[dissolution of parliament|dissolving the legislature]] (parliamentary system) more problematic if the date should happen to fall at time when dissolution is inconvenient (e.g. when war breaks out). Other states (e.g., the [[United Kingdom]]) only set maximum time in office, and the executive decides exactly when within that limit it will actually go to the polls. In practice, this means the government remains in power for close to its full term, and choose an election date it calculates to be in its best interests (unless something special happens, such as a [[motion of no-confidence]]). This calculation depends on a number of variables, such as its performance in opinion polls and the size of its majority.

===Election campaigns===
{{main article|Political campaign}}
When elections are called, politicians and their supporters attempt to influence policy by competing directly for the votes of constituents in what are called campaigns.  Supporters for a campaign can be either formally organized or loosely affiliated, and frequently utilize [[campaign advertising]]. It is common for political scientists to attempt to predict elections via [[Political Forecasting]] methods.

The most expensive election campaign included US$7 billion spent on the [[United States presidential election, 2012]] and is followed by the US$5 billion spent on the [[Indian general election, 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Difficulties with elections===
{{main article|Electoral fraud|Unfair election}}[[File:Voting under military protection in Buenos Ayres.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Election Proceedings in [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Ayres]]: Voting under military protection (''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', [[26 March]] [[1892]]).]]

In many countries with weak [[rule of law]], the most common reason why elections do not meet international standards of being "free and fair" is interference from the incumbent government. [[Dictator]]s may use the powers of the executive (police, martial law, censorship, physical implementation of the election mechanism, etc.) to remain in power despite popular opinion in favor of removal. Members of a particular faction in a legislature may use the power of the majority or supermajority (passing criminal laws, defining the electoral mechanisms including eligibility and district boundaries) to prevent the balance of power in the body from shifting to a rival faction due to an election.&lt;ref name="Brit" /&gt;

Non-governmental entities can also interfere with elections, through physical force, verbal intimidation, or fraud, which can result in improper casting or counting of votes. Monitoring for and minimizing electoral fraud is also an ongoing task in countries with strong traditions of free and fair elections. Problems that prevent an election from being "free and fair" take various forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free and Fair Elections|url=http://www.publicsphereproject.org/content/free-and-fair-elections|website=Public Sphere Project|accessdate=8 November 2015|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Early voting]] has been criticized as harmful to democracy.

====Lack of open political debate or an informed electorate====
The electorate may be poorly informed about issues or candidates due to lack of [[freedom of the press]], lack of objectivity in the press due to state or corporate control, and/or lack of access to news and political media. [[Freedom of speech]] may be curtailed by the state, favoring certain viewpoints or state [[propaganda]].

====Unfair rules====

[[File:The Presidential Election in Argentina, the Polling-Station at the Church of La Merced, Buenos Ayres.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Presidential Election in [[Argentina]], the Polling Station at the Church of La Merced, [[Buenos Aires]]. "The rival voters were kept back by an armed force of police out of sight to others. Only batches of two or three were allowed to enter the polling-office at a time. Armed sentries guarded the gates and the doors leading to the office, and were also posted on the roofs of adjoining houses and in the belfry and tower of the church." ([[Godefroy Durand]], ''[[The Graphic]]'', [[21 May]] [[1892]]).]]

[[Gerrymandering]], exclusion of opposition candidates from eligibility for office, needlessly high restrictions on who may be a candidate, like [[ballot access]] rules, and manipulating thresholds for electoral success are some of the ways the structure of an election can be changed to favor a specific faction or candidate.

====Interference with campaigns====
Those in power may arrest or assassinate candidates, suppress or even criminalize campaigning, close campaign headquarters, harass or beat campaign workers, or intimidate voters with violence. [[Foreign electoral intervention]] can also occur.

====Tampering with the election mechanism====

This can include confusing or misleading voters about how to vote, violation of the [[secret ballot]], [[ballot stuffing]], tampering with voting machines, destruction of legitimately cast ballots, [[voter suppression]], voter registration fraud, failure to validate voter residency, fraudulent tabulation of results, and use of physical force or verbal intimation at polling places. Other examples include persuading candidates into not standing against them, such as through blackmailing, bribery, intimidation or physical violence.

== Sham election ==
A '''sham election''' is an election that is held purely for show; that is, without any significant political choice or real impact on results of election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/sham-election/|title=Sham Election Law and Legal Definition {{!}} USLegal, Inc.|last=Inc.|first=US Legal,|website=definitions.uslegal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Show elections are a common event in [[Dictator|dictatorial]] regimes that feel the need to feign the appearance of public [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]]. Published results usually show nearly 100% [[voter turnout]] and high support (close to 100% in many cases) for the prescribed candidate(s) or for the [[referendum]] choice that favors the [[political party]] in power. Dictatorial regimes can also organize show elections with results simulating those that might be achieved in democratic countries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/kim-jong-un-wins-100-of-the-vote-in-north-korean-elections-9180814.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of such elections are [[Elections in Italy|elections]] in [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] in [[Italian general election, 1929|1929]] and [[Italian general election, 1934|1934]], [[Elections in Germany#Elections in Nazi Germany|elections]] in [[Nazi Germany]], [[Portuguese presidential election, 1958]], most [[Communist state|communist]] and [[Socialist state|socialist states]] ([[Elections in East Germany|East Germany]], [[Elections in the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]], [[Elections in China|China]], [[Elections in North Korea|North Korea]], etc.), and [[Baathist Iraq|Baathist]] [[Elections in Iraq#History|Iraq]]. A predetermined conclusion is always established by the regime, either through [[Political repression|suppression]] of the opposition, [[coercion]] of voters, [[Electoral fraud|vote rigging]], a forged number of "votes received" (e.g. the [[State of Vietnam referendum, 1955]]), outright lying, or some combination. In an extreme example, [[Charles D. B. King]] of [[Liberia]] claimed he received 243,000 votes in the [[Liberian general election, 1927|1927 general election]], which exceeded the number of eligible voters over 15 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberiapastandpresent.org/1927ElectionsMF.htm|title=Liberia past and present 1927 elections|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coercion ===
[[File:Wahlzettel-3.-Reich.jpg|thumb|right|A ballot from the [[German parliamentary election and referendum, 1936|1936 elections in Nazi Germany]]. Voters had no options other than Adolf Hitler.]]
Ballots in a show election may contain only one "yes" option. In the case of a simple "yes or no" question, people who pick "no" are often [[Persecution|persecuted]], thus making the "yes" choice the only option ([[false dilemma]]). An example of this is the elections of the [[People's Parliament|People's Parliaments]] in [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]], [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvia]], and [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]] in 1940 shortly after the Soviet [[occupation of the Baltic states]]; where those who voted received stamps in their passport for voting and those who did not vote did not receive stamps and were persecuted as [[Enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]. Another example is in contemporary [[North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764407,00.html|title=RUSSIA: Justice in The Baltic|date=1940-08-19|work=Time|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlYes, There Are Elections in North Korea and Heres How They Work - The Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/03/north-korea-elections-guide/358875/ |title=Yes, There Are Elections in North Korea and Here's How They Work - The Atlantic |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, show elections can backfire against the party in power, especially if the regime believes they are popular enough to win without coercion or fraud. The most famous example of this was the [[Myanmar general election, 1990|1990 Myanmar general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/05/26/burma-20-years-after-1990-elections-democracy-still-denied|title=Burma: 20 Years After 1990 Elections, Democracy Still Denied|date=2010-05-26|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2320">The '''European Liberation Front''' (ELF) was a small [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] group that split from [[Oswald Mosley]]'s British [[Union Movement]] in 1948. Its founder and ideological inspiration was [[Francis Parker Yockey]]. In 1949 they issued a manifesto titled ''The Proclamation of London'', written by Yockey.[http://home.alphalink.com.au/~radnat/fpyockey/proclamation.html] The [[pan-nationalism|pan-nationalist]] (Pan-Europeanist) and [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] movement had little impact, and lasted until 1954.

In the 1990s, the ELF, Yockey, and his ideology, were rediscovered by the [[Nouvelle Résistance]], [[Alternativa Europea]], [[National-Bolshevik Party]], [[National Revolutionary Faction]], and others. In 1999, a manifesto of a second 'European Liberation Front' was published in Paris, but there is apparently no more active organisation of that name now. The manifesto takes its ideological inspiration from Yockey, and from [[Otto Strasser]], who was expelled from the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi party]] by [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1930. 

Despite the pan-European style of its title, the ideology of the manifesto is [[ethnicity|ethnic]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] nationalism: the manifesto speaks of the "historical and cultural ties which exist between our respective nations" and calls for "mono-ethnic racial homelands" to preserve the "race, culture and traditions of all European peoples". European liberation, according to the manifesto, consists of "National Revolution".

Continental Europeans, like [[Jean-François Thiriart]] and [[Alain de Benoist]] were already influenced by the work of Yockey in the 1960s.

'''Findhorn Ecovillage''' is an experimental architectural community project based at The Park, in [[Moray]], Scotland, near the village of [[Findhorn]].&lt;ref name=local&gt;Local relations between the [[Findhorn Foundation]] and the village of [[Findhorn]] have occasionally foundered over inconsiderate use of the word 'Findhorn' to mean either the former or the Ecovillage. See for example Walker (1994), [[Talk:Findhorn Foundation]] and also [[Findhorn (disambiguation)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The project's main aim is to demonstrate a [[sustainable development]] in environmental, social, and economic terms. Work began in the early 1980s under the auspices of the [[Findhorn Foundation]] but now includes a wide diversity of organisations and activities.&lt;ref name = "Lovie"&gt;Lovie, R. et al.

A recent independent study&lt;ref name= SDRC&gt;Tinsley, S. and George, H. (2006) ''Ecological Footprint of the Findhorn Foundation and Community.'' Moray. Sustainable Development Research Centre, UHI Millennium Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; concludes that the residents have the lowest [[ecological footprint]] of any community measured so far in the industrialised world and is also half of the UK average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/findhorn-eco-footprint-is-world-s-smallest-1.827780|title=Findhorn eco-footprint is ‘world’s smallest’|author=Edwards, Rob|publisher=[[Sunday Herald]]|date=4 August 2007|accessdate=2012-12-30|quote=A new expert study says the multinational community's ecological footprint is half the UK average. This means Findhorn uses 50% fewer resources and creates 50% less waste than normal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the project has attracted some controversy,  the growing profile of [[environmental movement|environmental issues]] such as [[climate change]] has led to a degree of mainstream acceptance of its ecological ethos.&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;Stern, Sir Nicholas. (2006) ''The Economics of Climate Change''. London. HM Treasury. {{ISBN|0-521-70080-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Guggenheim"&gt;''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' (2006) Directed by Davis Guggenheim and starring [[Al Gore]]. Paramount Classics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cavendish"&gt;Cavendish, C. (31 October 2006) ''The only debate left on carbon emissions is political.'' London. The Times newspaper.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
The October 1982 Conference ‘Building a Planetary Village’&lt;ref name = "Scott"&gt;Scott, M. (2005) ''A Living Record of the Findhorn Community''. Findhorn Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; hosted by the [[Findhorn Foundation]] marked the beginning of serious attempts by the [[intentional community]], which had existed at [[Findhorn]] since 1962&lt;ref name = "Riddell"&gt;Riddell, C. (1990) ''The Findhorn Community: Creating a Human Identity for the 21st Century''. Findhorn Press.&lt;/ref&gt; to demonstrate a human settlement that could be considered [[sustainable]] in environmental, social, and economic terms.&lt;ref name = "McLaughlin"&gt;McLaughlin, C. and Davidson, G. (1986) ''Builders of the Dawn: Community Lifestyles in a Changing World.'' Sirius.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ‘[[ecovillage]]’ later came to be used to describe such experiments and in 1995 the first international conference of ecovillages, ''Ecovillages and Sustainable Communities for the 21st Century'', was held in Findhorn.&lt;ref name=Bang&gt;{{cite book|title=Ecovillages. A Practical Guide to Sustainable Communities|author=Bang, Jan Martin|publisher=Floris Books|year=2005|place=Edinburgh|page=22|isbn=0-86315-480-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Dawson"&gt;Dawson, J. (2006) ''Ecovillages: New Frontiers for Sustainability''. Totnes. Green Books. According to this source 400 people attended the conference and a further 300 were turned away.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first almost all of the activities this involved, such as eco-house construction, a 75&amp;nbsp;kW [[Vestas]] wind  turbine and an ecological waste water treatment system were undertaken by the Findhorn Foundation itself, or its trading company New Findhorn Directions Ltd.&lt;ref name = "walker"&gt;Walker, Alex (Ed). (1994). ''The Kingdom Within: A Guide to the Spiritual Work of the Findhorn Community''. Findhorn Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 1990 onwards a growing number of independent charities, businesses, small sister communities, independent practitioners and community bodies have grown up and significantly extended the size and diversity of ecological projects,&lt;ref name = "findhorn"&gt;[http://www.ecovillagefindhorn.com/  EcoVillage Findhorn].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Metcalf"&gt;Metcalf, B. (2004) ''The Findhorn Book of Community Living''. Findhorn Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pewters"&gt;Pewters, V. and Stengel, M. (eds. (2005) ''Eurotopia: Directory of Intentional Communities and Ecovillages in Europe''. Bandua. Okodorf Sieben Linden.&lt;/ref&gt; some of which are listed below. As of 2005 the Ecovillage has around 450 members centred around The Park (the main campus on the southern edge of Findhorn), but also based at numerous locations in the nearby town of [[Forres]] and elsewhere in [[Moray]]. The project supports approximately 300 jobs in the Findhorn/Forres area and provides a total aggregate economic impact in excess of £5 million per annum in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] of Scotland as a whole.&lt;ref name = "Burns2003"&gt;Burns, B. Westbrook, S. et al. (2003) ''Findhorn Foundation Impact Assessment''. [[Highlands and Islands Enterprise|HIE]] Moray.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of eco-projects==
[[Ecovillage]]s usually rely on a wide variety of approaches to minimise their ecological footprint.  Some of the most important used at Findhorn are listed here although it is important to bear in mind that in any given situation the single largest factor is likely to be the attitudes of the residents rather than the technologies themselves.  The national scale is far better researched than the micro scale, and at this level it is easy to observe that countries with similar levels of wealth may have quite different footprints — see for example Chambers (2004).

===Ecological building codes===
[[File:PA120016.JPG|thumb|An eco-house at Findhorn with turf roof and [[solar panel]]s]]
The site has a comprehensive building code that all new buildings are required to meet. It goes far beyond current UK building standards&lt;ref name = "Talbott1993"&gt;Talbott, John. (1993) ''Simply Build Green''. Findhorn Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; and includes features such as very efficient insulation (typically using products made from recycled paper), non-toxic organic paints, wood preservatives and boarding manufactured without the use of toxic glues or resins and roofing with natural clay tiles.

There are a wide variety of other options used including low-energy light bulbs, 'breathing wall' construction allowing a controlled exchange of air &amp; vapour water conservation features and locally sourced materials. Shared facilities such as laundry, kitchens, lounges etc. are encouraged, thus avoiding unnecessary duplication.&lt;ref name = "Talbott2001"&gt;Talbott, J., and others (2001) ''The Essential Guide''. Findhorn. Titleholders’ Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most new buildings incorporate design features that invite passive solar radiation to reduce building heating needs, such as south-facing windows, conservatories and minimal wall openings on north walls. Sustainably harvested wood provides space heating for many homes both old and new, and an Ecovillage company supplies solar panels for domestic hot water heating to residential and commercial customers throughout the UK.&lt;ref name = "aessolar"&gt;[http://www.aessolar.co.uk/  AESSolar].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Highlands and Islands Community Energy Company]] recently awarded a grant for the installation of ground 
source heating for the proposed new Moray Arts Centre based at Findhorn.&lt;ref name = "HIE"&gt;[http://www.hie.co.uk/HICEC/CEnews_oct.pdf  HICEC ''Community Energy News'']: October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Simply Build Green'' — Talbott (1993) — is based on research undertaken at Findhorn Ecovillage and was the UK’s first technical guide to ecological housing.

===Eco-architecture===
The first new dwelling to be constructed at the Ecovillage was a small house in the round made from a recycled [[whisky]] barrel. The idea was later developed and several buildings on this theme were constructed. Other innovative styles include a [[Straw-bale construction|strawbale house]], and an [[earthship]] electricity sub-station. Over fifty new houses have now been constructed, some in exotic styles, others more prosaic in appearance.  The rigorous building codes contrast with an apparent absence of visual guidelines and the result is a diversity of design rather than a consistent approach to aesthetics.

===Living Machine===
[[File:FindhornLM.jpg|thumb|The Living Machine wastewater treatment plant at Findhorn.]]
In 1995 [[Jonathon Porritt]] opened Europe's first [[Living Machine]] (also known as Eco-Restorers in The UK) at The Park campus. This is an ecologically engineered waste water treatment system which is designed to treat sewage from a population of up to 350 people and in common with a number of other such systems&lt;ref name="ltl"&gt;[http://www.ltluk.com/  LTL UK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004013256/http://ltluk.com/ |date=2006-10-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; also provides a research and educational facility to promote the technology.  It was constructed with assistance from the [[European Union]]. The invention of Canadian scientist [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], they use tanks containing diverse communities of bacteria, algae, micro-organisms, numerous species of plants and trees, snails, fish and other living creatures to treat the water.&lt;ref name=ltl/&gt; At the end of the series of tanks, the resulting water is pure enough to be returned to the local water table. Plans to use the water for irrigation have been considered but not implemented to date.&lt;ref name = "West"&gt;West, Sarah. (2002) ''Proposal for Reuse of Sewage Effluent from the Findhorn Living Machine''. Sydney Water.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic food production===
One of the most significant factors in the Ecovillage's low eco-footprint (see below) is its attitude to food production and consumption. Various smallholdings associated with the Ecovillage contribute to a [[community supported agriculture]] or 'box' scheme which provides [[organic food|organic produce]] for the local area, some of it grown using [[permaculture]] techniques. This horticulture '"provides more than 70% of the community's fresh food requirements"&lt;ref name="food"&gt;[http://www.ecovillagefindhorn.com/food/  Findhorn food]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041109051719/http://www.ecovillagefindhorn.com/food/ |date=9 November 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "EarthShare"&gt;[http://www.earthshare.co.uk/  EarthShare].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Phoenix Community Stores]], based at the Park, is one of the largest retailers of organic produce in northern Scotland.&lt;ref name = "Phœnix"&gt;[http://www.ekopia.findhorn.com/community.html#phoenix  Phœnix] Community Stores.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind park===
Another reason for the low ecological impact of the settlement is the presence of four [[Vestas]] wind turbines which can generate up to 750&amp;nbsp;kW. These make the Park settlement net exporters of electricity produced from [[renewable]] resources. The first V17 generator was installed in 1989 and three additional V29s were installed in March 2006. The original site was a [[trailer park|caravan park]]  and as a result the Ecovillage has its own private electricity grid. Most of the generation is used on-site with any surplus exported to the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]].

{{Update|section|date=March 2017}}

Since 2002 a [[local currency]] has been in operation. Launched by Ekopia, the community’s [[development trust]], it is accepted by almost all Ecovillage organizations. There are roughly £20,000 of notes in circulation and issuing them has enabled Ekopia to make low interest loans and donations to support various initiatives including an ecological guest facility, the wind park (above) and the local Youth Project.&lt;ref&gt;''Rainbow Bridge.'' (September 2006). Findhorn Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; The current issue, which is due to expire in 2011, is at par with sterling i.e. 1 Eko = £1, and notes are in one, five, ten and twenty denominations.&lt;ref name="Eko"&gt;[http://www.ekopia.findhorn.com/eko.html  Eko] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901182614/http://www.ekopia.findhorn.com/eko.html |date=2006-09-01 }} currency.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological Footprint Study==
[[File:Findhorn wind turbines.jpg|thumb|The wind turbines at Findhorn, which make the Ecovillage a net exporter of electricity.]]
An [[ecological footprint]] is an attempt to measure the total environmental impact of human activities in a given area. The results measure the amount of land and water that the population requires to provide the resources they utilise and to absorb their wastes. The calculations used converts this into a measure of land area, global hectares (gha). It is widely accepted&lt;ref name=SDRC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;Chambers, N. et al. (2004) ''Scotland’s Footprint''. Best Foot Forward.&lt;/ref&gt; that the human impact on planet Earth now exceeds the available capacity of natural systems to sustain it, and that western countries typically have a resource usage that ‘would require three planets’ to maintain if every citizen on Earth had a similar impact. In October 2006 preliminary results of the ecological footprint study&lt;ref name=SDRC/&gt; for the Findhorn Ecovillage undertaken by The [[Sustainable Development Research Centre]] of the [[UHI Millennium Institute]] in collaboration with the [[Stockholm Environment Institute]] confirmed that ecovillages can tread significantly more lightly on the Earth than more conventional communities.

The study found that residents of The Park and the nearby campus of [[Cluny Hill]] College have, on average, a footprint of 2.71 hectares per capita, a little over half the UK national average of 5.4 hectares. (By comparison the comparable figure for the United States is 9.5gha, whilst [[Uzbekistan]] is rated at the average 'global earthshare' of 1.9gha).&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt; Of particular significance are the results relating to food, ‘home and energy' use, and  'consumables and personal possessions' which have 35%, 27% and 44% of the national average respectively. Findhorn residents have an eco-footprint some 13% lower than those at the London eco-housing development, [[BedZED]]. The study is also intending to measure the additional impact caused by visitors to the Ecovillage but results are not yet available.

==Awards, UN connections and critiques==
At a time when resource depletion and global warming are international concerns it is not perhaps surprising that these activities should receive various accolades.

* In September 1995 The Findhorn Ecological Village Project was awarded the 'We the Peoples 50 Communities' award given by the Friends of the [[United Nations]] as part of the 50th Anniversary of the UN Celebrations.&lt;ref name= Burns/&gt;
* In October 1998 the Ecovillage Project, together with other 100 leadership Initiatives "which are inspiring innovative action on Earth", received Best Practice Designation from the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements — UNCHS (Habitat) and Dubai Municipality.&lt;ref name= Burns/&gt;

[[File:PA120021.jpg|thumb|A larger, 200&amp;nbsp;m² plus Eco-house.]]

* In September 2000 the conservation charity Trees for Life received the Millennium Marque Award in recognition of its work in helping to restore the Caledonian Forest in [[Glen Affric]].&lt;ref name = "Trees"&gt;[http://www.treesforlife.org.uk/ Trees for Life].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The following year the [[UNEP|United Nations Environment Programme]] noted that "most of the problems identified by [[Agenda 21]] have their roots at the local level, therefore UNEP appreciates your significant contribution at the local level to models for holistic and sustainable living in harmony with the environment."&lt;ref name= Burns/&gt;

Various critiques exist in print, although these tend to concentrate on the eclectic spirituality of the [[Findhorn Foundation]] rather than the environmental aspects of the Ecovillage.  There is a statement of core values for the Ecovillage and its associated community called ‘Common Ground’&lt;ref name="Common Ground"&gt;[http://www.findhorn.com/nfa/NFA/CoreValues  Common Ground] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021054546/http://www.findhorn.com/nfa/NFA/CoreValues |date=2006-10-21 }}, the core values of the New Findhorn Association.&lt;/ref&gt; but other than affirming a commitment to "active spiritual practice" (which is diversely understood and interpreted&lt;ref name=walker/&gt;) it concentrates largely on preferred interpersonal behaviours rather than prescribing a spiritual philosophy.  Objections were raised by a local pressure group against the expansion of the wind park&lt;ref name = "Elgin"&gt;''Action group maps out last chance to halt wind farms''. (27.5.2003) Elgin. The Northern Scot newspaper.&lt;/ref&gt; but the concerns of local people&lt;ref name=local/&gt; about the Ecovillage appear to have reduced, partly due to the proactive stance of the ecovillagers themselves,&lt;ref name=walker/&gt; especially perhaps as a result of the gift of some amenity land to a local [[land trust]] by Duneland Ltd., an Ecovillage company.&lt;ref name = "Duneland"&gt;[http://www.duneland.co.uk/history.html  Duneland].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bay"&gt;[http://www.findhornbay.net/findhorn/dates/page27a.htm  Findhorn village community] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050219063115/http://www.findhornbay.net/findhorn/dates/page27a.htm |date=2005-02-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While many houses are modest in size some are large, exceeding 200&amp;nbsp;m² in built area for a single household. Diversity of lifestyle may well be part of any human settlement but the magnitude of such structures hints that the commitment to ‘living lightly on the Earth’ is not as whole-hearted as first appearances may suggest. Nonetheless, working examples of how a western lifestyle might be possible whilst living within the means of the Earth's renewable resources to support it are likely to be of interest at a time when the consensus of mainstream opinion is moving  towards the view that ‘business as usual’ may no longer be an option.&lt;ref name=Stern/&gt;

'''Human services''' is an interdisciplinary field with the objective of meeting human needs through an applied knowledge base, focusing on prevention as well as remediation of problems, and maintaining a commitment to improving the overall quality of life of service populations. The process involves the study of social technologies (practice methods, models, and theories), service technologies (programs, organizations, and systems), and scientific innovations that are designed to ameliorate problems and enhance the quality of life of individuals, families and communities to improve the delivery of service with better coordination, accessibility and accountability.&lt;ref name=Herzberg2015&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herzberg |first1=Judith T. |date=2015 |title=Foundations in human services practice: A generalist perspective on individual, agency, and community |edition=1st |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson |oclc=881181908 |isbn=9780205858255}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of human services is to promote a practice that involves simultaneously working at all levels of society (whole-person approach) in the process of promoting the autonomy of individuals or groups, making informal or formal human services systems more efficient and effective, and advocating for positive social change within society.

Human services practitioners strive to advance the autonomy of service users through civic engagement, education, health promotion and social change at all levels of society. Practitioners also engage in advocating so human systems remain accessible, integrated, efficient and effective.

Human services academic programs can be readily found in colleges and universities, which award degrees at the associate, baccalaureate, and graduate levels. Human services programs exist in countries all around the world.

==History==

===United States===
Human services has its roots in [[Charitable organizations (Canada)|charitable]] activities of religious and civic organizations that date back to the Colonial period.  However, the academic discipline of human services did not start until the 1960s. At that time, a group of college academics started the new human services movement and began to promote the adoption of a new ideology about human service delivery and [[Professional|professionalism]] among traditional helping disciplines.&lt;ref name="Chenault Burnford 1978"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chenault|first1=Joann|last2=Burnford|first2=Fran|date=1978|title=Human services professional education: Future directions|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|oclc=3650238|isbn=9780070107328}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement's major goal was to make service delivery more efficient, effective, and humane. The other goals dealt with the reeducation of traditional helping professionals ([[interprofessional education]]), to have a greater appreciation of the individual as a whole person ([[humanistic psychology]]) and to be accountable to the communities they serve ([[postmodernism]]). Furthermore, professionals would learn to take responsibility at all levels of [[government]], use systems approaches to consider human problems, and be involved in progressive social change.

Traditional academic programs such as [[education]], [[nursing]], [[social work]], [[law]] and [[medicine]] were resistant to the new human services movement's ideology because it appeared to challenge their professional status. Changing the traditional concept of professionalism involved rethinking consumer control and the distribution of power. The new movement also called on human service professionals to work for [[social change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dumont|first=M|year=1970|title=The changing face of professionalism|journal=Social Policy|volume=1|pages=26–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed that the reduction of the monopolistic control of professionals could result in [[democratization of knowledge]] and would lead to professionals advocating on behalf of clients and communities against professional establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reiff |first1=R. |date=1970 |chapter=Community psychology, community mental health and social needs: The need for a body of knowledge in community psychology |editor1-first=Ira |editor1-last=Iscoe |editor2-first=Charles D. |editor2-last=Spielberger |title=Community psychology: Perspectives in training and research |pages=1- |location=New York |publisher=Appleton |oclc=92432 |isbn=9780390477712}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement also hoped that human service delivery systems would become integrated, comprehensive, and more accessible, which would make them more humane for service users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Agranoff| first1=R. |chapter=Human services administration: Service delivery, service integration, and training |pages=42–51 |editor-last=Mikulecky |editor-first=Thomas J. |date=1974 |title=Human services integration: a report of a special project conducted by the American Society for Public Administration |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Society for Public Administration |oclc=918115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker1974&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=F |date=June 1974 |title=From community mental health to human service ideology |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=576–581 |pmid=4829069 |pmc=1775477 |doi=10.2105/ajph.64.6.576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the resistance from traditional helping professions served as the impetus for a group of educators in [[higher education]] to start the new academic discipline of human services.

Some maintain that the human services discipline has a concrete identity as a profession that supplements and complements other traditional professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mehr |first1=Joseph J. |last2=Kanwischer |first2=Ronald |date=2004 |title=Human services: concepts and intervention strategies |edition=9th |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson/Allyn and Bacon |oclc=51477841 |isbn=9780205381210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet other professionals and scholars have not agreed upon an authoritative definition for human services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kincaid |first1=Susan O. |date=2009 |title=Defining human services: A discourse analysis |journal=Human service education |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=14–23 |issn=0890-5428 |url=http://www.nationalhumanservices.org/assets/Journal/2009.pdf |format=PDF |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6c80rxEKc?url=http://www.nationalhumanservices.org/assets/Journal/2009.pdf |archive-date=8 October 2015 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic programs==

===United States===

====Development====
Chenault and Burnford argued that human services programs must educate and train students at the graduate or postgraduate level if human services hoped to be considered a professional discipline.&lt;ref name="Chenault Burnford 1978" /&gt; A progressive graduate human services program was established by Audrey Cohen (1932–1996), who was considered an innovative educator for her time. The Audrey Cohen College of Human Services, now called the [[Metropolitan College of New York]], offered one of the first graduate programs in 1974.&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grant |first1=Gerald |last2=Riesman |first2=David |date=1978 |title=The perpetual dream: reform and experiment in the American college |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |oclc=3203327 |isbn=9780226306056}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same time period, [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)|Springfield College]] in [[Massachusetts]] became a major force in preserving human services as an academic discipline. Currently, Springfield College is one of the oldest and largest human services program in the United States.

Manpower studies in the 1960s and 70s had shown that there would be a shortage of helping professionals in an array of service delivery areas.&lt;ref name=Cohen1969&gt;Cohen, 1969.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kadish1969&gt;Kadish, 1969.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McPheeters&gt;{{citation |last1=McPheeters |first1=Harold L. |last2=King |first2=James B. |author3=Southern Regional Education Board |author3-link=Southern Regional Education Board |date=February 1971 |title=Plans for teaching mental health workers: Community college curriculum objectives |location=Bethesda, MD |publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED065726.pdf |format=PDF |oclc=425565522 |id=[[Education Resources Information Center|ERIC]] [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED065726 ED065726]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, some educators proposed that the training of nonprofessionals (e.g., mental health technicians)could bridge this looming personnel shortage.&lt;ref name=McPheeters/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweitzer |first1=H. Frederick |date=2003 |title=Multiple forms of scholarship and their implications on human service educators |journal=Human Service Education |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=5–13 |issn=0890-5428 |url=http://www.nationalhumanservices.org/assets/Journal/2003.pdf |format=pdf |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6c80HXJZA?url=http://www.nationalhumanservices.org/assets/Journal/2003.pdf |archive-date=8 October 2015 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=True&gt;{{cite journal |last1=True |first1=John E. |last2=Young |first2=Carl E. |date=December 1974 |title=Associate degree programs for human service workers |journal=Personnel and Guidance Journal |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=304–307 |doi=10.1002/j.2164-4918.1974.tb03788.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest educational initiatives to develop undergraduate curricula was undertaken by the [[Southern Regional Education Board]] (SREB), which was funded by the National Institute on Health. Professionals of the SREB Undergraduate Social Welfare Manpower Project helped colleges develop new social welfare programs, which later became known as human services.&lt;ref name=McPheetersRyan1971&gt;{{citation |last1=McPheeters |first1=Harold L. |last2=Ryan |first2=Robert M. |author3=Southern Regional Education Board |author3-link=Southern Regional Education Board |date=December 1971 |title=A Core of Competence for Baccalaureate Social Welfare and Curricular Implications |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED079210.pdf |format=PDF |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Social and Rehabilitation Service ([[United States Department of Health and Human Services#Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]]) |id=[[Education Resources Information Center|ERIC]] [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED079210 ED079210] |oclc=425729945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believed that [[community college]] human services programs were the most expedient way to train [[paraprofessional]]s for direct service jobs in areas such as mental health.&lt;ref name=True/&gt; Currently, a large percentage of human services programs are run at the community college level.

The development of community college human services programs was supported with government funding that was earmarked for the federal new careers initiatives. In turn, the federally funded [[New Careers|New Careers Program]] was created to produce a nonprofessional career track for economically disadvantaged, underemployed, and unemployed adults as a strategy to eradicate poverty within society&lt;ref name=GrosserEtAl1969&gt;Grosser, Henry, &amp; Kelly, 1969.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haskell1969&gt;Haskell, 1969.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PearlRiessman1965&gt;Pearl &amp; Riessman, 1965.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RiessmanPopper1968&gt;Riessman &amp; Popper, 1968.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to end a critical shortage of health-care personnel.&lt;ref name=SteinbergEtAl1969&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steinberg |first1=Sheldon S. |last2=Shatz |first2=Eunice O. |last3=Fishman |first3=Jacob R. |date=July 1969 |title=New careers: a major solution to the environmental health problem |url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.59.7.1118 |format=PDF |journal=American journal of Public Health and the Nation's Health |volume=59 |issue=7 |pmid=5815750 |pmc=1226583 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.59.7.1118 |pages=1118–1123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduates from these programs successfully acquired employment as paraprofessionals,&lt;ref name=True/&gt; but there were limitations to their [[upward mobility]] within social service agencies because they lacked a graduate or professional degree.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;

====Current programs====
Currently, there are academic programs in human services at the associate, baccalaureate, and graduate levels. There are approximately 600 human services programs throughout the United States. An online directory of human services programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Directory of human services programs |url=http://www.drcdata.com/(S(lmu34f45d5bgwr3j0remqo55))/hsReview.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929004524/http://www.drcdata.com/%28S%28coyi11mtscb0hr45dw1rggu5%29%29/hsReview.aspx |archive-date=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists many (but not all) of the programs state by state in conjunction with their [[accreditation]] status from the Council of Standards for Human Services Education (CSHSE).

The CSHSE offers accreditation for human services programs in higher education. The accreditation process is voluntary and labor-intensive; it is designed to assure the quality, consistency, and relevance of human service education through research-based standards and a peer-review process. According to the CSHSE's webpage there are only 43 accredited human services programs in the United States. The Standards for each level of degree accredited by CSHSE can be obtained by clicking on the following links:

Human services curricula are based on an interdisciplinary knowledge foundation that allows students to consider practical solutions from multiple disciplinary perspectives. Across the curriculum human services students are often taught to view human problems from a socioecological perspective (developed by [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]]) that involves viewing human strengths and problems as interconnected to a family unit, community, and society. This perspective is considered a “whole-person perspective”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Woodside |first1=Marianne |last2=McClam |first2=Tricia |date=2009 |title=An introduction to human services |edition=6th |location=Bemont, CA |publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |oclc=224438780 |isbn=9780495503361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, undergraduate programs prepare students to be human services generalists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burger |first1=William R. |last2=Youkeles |first2=Merrill |date=2004 |title=Human services in contemporary America |edition=6th |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Brooks/Cole--Thomson Learning |oclc=52578972 |isbn=9780534547479}}&lt;/ref&gt; while master’s programs prepare students to be human services administrators,&lt;ref name="Chenault Burnford 1978" /&gt; and doctoral programs prepare students to be researcher-analysts and college-level educators. Research in this field focuses on an array of topics that deal with direct service issues, [[Case management (mental health)|case management]],&lt;ref name=Herzberg2015/&gt; organizational change, management of human service organizations,&lt;ref name=Kettner2014&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kettner |first1=Peter M. |date=2014 |title=Excellence in human service organization management |edition=2nd |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson Education |oclc=829937218 |isbn=9780205088157}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocacy,&lt;ref name=Martin2014&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martin |first1=Michelle E. |date=2014 |title=Advocacy for social justice: A global perspective |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson |oclc=858610652 |isbn=9780205087396}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[community organizing]], [[community development]], social welfare policy, service integration, [[multiculturalism]], integration of technology, [[Poverty|poverty issues]], [[social justice]], development,&lt;ref name=Dustin2013&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dustin |first1=Jill C. |date=2013 |title=Grant writing and fundraising tool kit for Human Services |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson Education |oclc=793099562 |isbn=9780205088690}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social change strategies.

==Certification and continuing education==

===United States===
The Center for Credentialing &amp; Education (CCE) conceptualized the Human Services-Board Certified Practitioner (HS-BCP) credential with the assistance of the National Organization for Human Services (NOHS) and the Council for Standards in Human Service Education (CSHSE). The credential was created for human services practitioners seeking to advance their careers by acquiring independent verification of their practical knowledge and educational background.&lt;ref name=ExamHSBCP&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Services-Board Certified Practitioner |website=Center for Credentialing and Education |url=http://www.cce-global.org/HSBCP/Exam |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232940/http://www.cce-global.org/HSBCP/Exam |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates from human services programs can obtain a Human Services Board Certified Practitioner (HS-BCP) credential offered by the Center for Credentialing &amp; Education (CCE). The HS-BCP certification ensures that human services practitioners offer quality services, are competent service providers, are committed to high standards, and adhere to the NOHS ''Ethical Standards of Human Service Professionals,'' as well as to help solidify the professional identity of human services practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Council for Standards in Human Services Education |url=http://www.cshse.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; HS-BCPE Experience Requirements for the certification:  HS-BCP applicants must meet post-graduation experience requirements to be eligible to take the examination. However, graduates of a CSHSE accredited degree program may sit for the HS-BCP exam without verifying their human services work experience. Otherwise experience requirements for candidates not from a CSHSE accredited program are as follows:  Associate degree with post degree experience requires three years, including a minimum of 4,500 hours; Bachelor’s Degree with post degree experience requires two years, including a minimum of 3,000 hours; Master’s or Doctorate with post degree experience requires one year, including a minimum of 1,500 hours.&lt;ref name=ExamHSBCP/&gt;

The HS-BCP exam is designed to verify a candidate’s human services knowledge. The exam was created as a collaborative effort of human services subject-matter experts and normed on a population of professionals in the field. The HS-BCP exam covers the following areas:

# Assessment, treatment planning, and outcome evaluation
# Theoretical orientation/interventions
# Case management, professional practice, and ethics
# Administration, program development/evaluation, and supervision

==Employment outlook==

===United States===
Currently, the three major employment roles played by human services graduates include providing direct service, performing administrative work, and working in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mandell |first1=Betty Reid |last2=Schram |first2=Barbara |date=2006 |title=An introduction to human services: Policy and practice |edition=6th |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson/Allyn and Bacon |oclc=58546150 |isbn=9780205442140}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Occupational Outlook Handbook]], published by the [[US Department of Labor]], the employment of human service assistants is anticipated to grow by 34% through 2016, which is faster than average for all occupations. There will also be excellent job opportunities for individuals with post-secondary degrees. But salaries remain low, which might reflect employers’ lack of understanding of the human services profession.

==Professional organizations==

===North America===
There are several different professional human services organizations for professionals, educators, and students to join across North America.

====United States====
The National Organization for Human Services (NOHS) is a professional organization open to educators, professionals, and students interested in current issues in the field of human services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Organization for Human Services|url=http://www.nationalhumanservices.org/|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NOHS sponsors an annual [[Business conference|conference]] in different parts of the United States. In addition, there are four independent human services regional organizations: (a) Mid-Atlantic Consortium for Human Services, (b) Midwest Organization for Human Services, (c) New England Organization for Human Service, and the (d) Northwest Human Services Association. All of the regional organizations are also open to educators, professionals, students and each regional organization has an annual conference in different locations throughout their region such as universities or institutions. 

Human services special interest groups also exist within the [[American Society for Public Administration]] (ASPA) and the [[American Educational Research Association]] (AERA). The ASPA subsection is named the Section on Health and Human Services Administration and its purpose is to foster the development of knowledge, understanding and practice in the fields of health and human services administration and to foster professional growth and communication among academics and practitioners in these fields. Fields of health and human services administration share a common and unique focus on improving the quality of life through client-centered policies and service transactions.

The AERA special interest group is named the Education, Health and Human Service Linkages. Its purpose is to create a community of researchers and practitioners interested in developing knowledge about comprehensive school health, school linked services, and initiatives that support children and their families. This subgroup also focuses on interpersonal collaboration, integration of services, and interdisciplinary approaches. The group’s interests encompass interrelated policy, practice, and research that challenge efforts to create viable linkages among these three distinct areas.

The American Public Human Services Association (APHSA) is a nonprofit organization that pursues distinction in health and human services by working with policymakers, supporting state and local agencies, and working with partners to promote innovative, integrative and efficient solutions in health and human services policy and practice. APHSA has individual and student memberships.

The '''International Arbitration and Peace Association''' (IAPA) was an [[list of anti-war organizations|organisation]] founded in [[London]] in 1880 with the stated objective of promoting [[arbitration]] and peace in place of [[armed conflict]]s and force. It published a journal, ''Concord''.

==Foundation==

Lewis Appleton organised the International Arbitration and Peace Association (IAPA) in 1880.
The meetings to organise the society, which began on 16 August 1880, were hosted by the municipal reformer William Phillips. [[Hodgson Pratt]] (1824–1907) was made chairman. Vice presidents included the newspaper editor [[John Passmore Edwards]], the Duke of Westminster, the Earl of Derby and the Earl of Shaftesbury.{{sfn|Ceadel|2000|p=112}}
Unlike the Peace Society the IAPA accepted defensive war, was not restricted to Christians and claimed to be international.{{sfn|Ceadel|2000|p=113}}
It also allowed women on the executive committee, and aimed to become a tribunal that would publish findings on disputes between two countries.
In the spring of 1882 E.M. Southey, the main founder of the Ladies Peace Association persuaded her group to disaffiliate from the Peace Society and join the IAPA.
The Quaker [[Priscilla Hannah Peckover]] played a central role in organising a new ladies auxiliary of the Peace Society that was launched on 12 July 1882.{{sfn|Ceadel|2000|p=114}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11273">[[Image:Caernafon Black Tower.jpg|thumb|[[Caernarfon Castle]] has been the site of two investitures in the 20th century]]

The '''Investiture of the Prince of Wales''' is the ceremony marking formal acknowledgement of a newly-created [[Prince of Wales]]. During the investiture ceremony, the prince is presented and [[investiture|invested]] with the ensigns of his rank and dignity, similar to a [[coronation]]. An investiture is purely ceremonial, as the title is created via [[letters patent]].

Investitures fell into abeyance and the revival of investing the Prince of Wales in 1911 was largely due to [[David Lloyd George]]'s instigation. A similar ceremony was also held in 1969 for Queen [[Elizabeth II]]'s son and heir, [[Prince Charles]].

==History==
[[Image:Edward I &amp; II.jpg|thumb|Edward I and Edward II]]
The tradition of investing the [[heir apparent]] of the English, and subsequently the British, monarch with the title of "Prince of Wales" began in 1301, when King [[Edward I of England]], having completed the conquest of Wales, gave the title to his heir apparent, Prince Edward (later King [[Edward II of England]]).

==Form==
Investiture is not necessary to be created Prince of Wales. [[Peerage|Peers]] were also invested, but investitures for peers ceased in 1621, at a time when peerages were being created so frequently that the investiture ceremonies became cumbersome. Most investitures for Princes of Wales were held in front of{{clarifyme|date=January 2017}} Parliament.

===Modern form===
In 1911 the future King [[Edward VIII]] was invested in [[Caernarfon Castle]] in Wales. The present Prince of Wales, Charles, was also invested there in 1969.

The ceremony in 1969 began with Prince Charles, led by the regalia bearers, entering the Chamberlain Tower, to await the arrival of Her Majesty. Once the royal family had arrived, the lesser members took their seat in the gallery, but the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, led by the Earl of Snowdon, the Lord Great Chamberlain, the Earl Marshal and the Gentleman Usher carrying the Great Sword of State, made their way to the stage where the investiture was to be conducted. After reaching the podium where the Secretary of State for Wales, carrying the Letters Patent was already standing, the Earl Marshal instructed Garter to conduct the Prince and his cortège from the tower. As they came to the stage Prince Charles knelt before the three thrones on the stage. During the reading of the Letters Patent in Welsh, the Queen invested Charles with the girdle, sword, coronet, ring, rod and kingly mantle, in that order. Prince Charles then declared, "I, Charles, Prince of Wales, do become your liege man of life and limb and of earthly worship, and faith and truth I bear unto you, to live and die against all manner of folks." Charles then customarily kissed the Queen's cheek and they embraced. Charles then took his place in the throne at his mother's right, before standing to give two speeches, one in Welsh and one in English. A brief religious service was then conducted and the Queen led the Prince of Wales to Queen Eleanor's Gate, to receive the homage of his adopted nation. The numerous banners and standards of the Prince of Wales were hung from the balcony.

The Letters Patent stated that Charles Philip Arthur George would receive the title, style, honour and privilege of the Principality of Wales and Earldom of Chester.

==Regalia==
{{main|Honours of the Principality of Wales}} {{see also|Coronet of Charles, Prince of Wales}}
During the reading of the letters patent creating the Prince, the [[Honours of the Principality of Wales]] are delivered to the Prince. The coronet of the heir apparent bears four crosses pattées alternating with four [[fleur-de-lys|fleurs-de-lis]], surmounted by a single arch (the Sovereign's crowns are of the same design, but use two arches). A gold rod is also used in the insignia; gold rods were formerly used in the investitures of dukes, but survive now in the investitures of Princes of Wales only. Also part of the insignia are a ring, a girdle, a sword and a robe.

===Coronets===
[[Image:Llywelyn le Dernier.jpg|thumb|left|Llywelyn the Last wearing his coronet]]
It is recorded that [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] had deposited [[Llywelyn's coronet|his coronet]] along with his other [[regalia]] with the monks at Cymer Abbey for safekeeping at the start of his final campaign in 1282. He was killed later that year. It was seized and presented to King [[Edward I of England]] as a token of the complete annihilation of the independent Welsh state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/Wales:+history+1066+to+1485|title=History of Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederick, Prince of Wales]], later had the [[Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales]], made at a cost of £140 5s. in 1728. It is unknown whether Frederick ever wore the coronet himself, but it was used by both his son, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and his grandson, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], when each was Prince of Wales.

Due to age{{clarifyme|date=January 2017}} Frederick's coronet was replaced by the [[Coronet of George, Prince of Wales]], made for the future [[George V|King George V]]. At George's own coronation in 1911, the coronet was worn by his son, Edward, the next Prince of Wales.

When the former [[Edward VIII|King Edward VIII]] went into exile as the [[Duke of Windsor]] in 1936 (following his [[Abdication of Edward VIII|abdication]]), he took with him the [[Coronet of George, Prince of Wales]], a highly controversial—and illegal—act. This coronet had been specially created for King George V, then Prince of Wales, and he wore it at [[Edward VII|his father]]'s coronation in 1902. The traditional coronet being unavailable, and with the older Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales being viewed{{clarifyme|date=January 2017}} unusable due to age{{clarifyme|date=January 2017}}, a new Prince of Wales coronet was made to be used for the investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales. The [[Coronet of Charles, Prince of Wales]], was produced by a committee under [[Antony Armstrong-Jones]], 1st [[Earl of Snowdon]], then husband of [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]].

==Investiture of Prince Charles==
[[File:Cofia 1282, a protest against the investiture (1537984)1.jpg|thumb|A large protest against the holding of the investiture in Caernarfon took place in March 1969]]
[[File:Caernarfon Castle 30 June 1969 - geograph.org.uk - 65937.jpg|thumb|right|Caernarfon Castle set up for the investiture of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], 30 June 1969]]

[[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] was created Prince of Wales and [[Earl of Chester]] by Letters Patent on 26 July 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=41460|page=4733|date=29 July 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pow"&gt;[http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/theprinceofwales/abouttheprince/previousprincesofwales/ Princes of Wales's site on previous Princes of Wales]&lt;/ref&gt; but the investiture was not until 1 July 1969. The ceremony at Caernarfon was well received by some Welsh people, but some nationalists view it as being associated with the subjugation of [[Welsh people]] since the 13th century, when [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] deposed the last native Prince of Wales, [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]]. Previous investitures had taken place at various locations, including the [[Palace of Westminster]], the seat of Parliament.&lt;ref name="ROYGOV-POW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5659.asp|title=The Royal Family &amp;gt; Royal titles &amp;gt; Style and titles of The Prince of Wales|accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh borough of [[Swansea]] was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] to mark the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faq.cityandcountyofswansea.info/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=98&amp;id=823&amp;artlang=en&amp;highlight=history|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) - When was Swansea given city status?|accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=44986|page=12450|date=12 December 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taught by [[Edward Millward]],&lt;ref&gt;"Charles termed serious, hard-working student", Leader-Post, 24 May 1969, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Charles spent ten weeks leading up to his investiture learning about Welsh culture and [[Welsh language|language]], and during the ceremony he gave his replies in both English and [[Welsh language|Welsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/theprinceofwales/biography/investiture/|title=Investiture as Prince of Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investiture was watched by millions on television, and attracted large and excited crowds in Caernarfon, but it also aroused considerable hostility among a minority of nationalist and republican Welsh people. The nationalist campaign against the investiture culminated with an attempted bombing by two members of the [[Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru]] (Movement for the Defence of Wales). On the eve of the investiture two bombers were killed whilst placing a bomb outside government offices in Abergele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/welsh-politics/welsh-politics-news/2008/11/20/militants-key-role-in-coming-of-devolution-left-ignored-deliberately-91466-22299413/|title=‘Militants’ key role in coming of devolution left ignored deliberately’}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, it has been claimed that the [[KGB]] plotted to disrupt the proceedings by bombing a bridge in [[Porthmadog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/446072.stm | work=BBC News | title=Prince of Wales 'bomb plot' revealed | date=13 September 1999 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent opinion polls the majority of Welsh people (usually cited as over 60%) have remained in favour of the monarchy, with a BBC Wales poll in 1999 finding that 73% of Welsh speakers want the position of Prince of Wales to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/377976.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wales backs Charles for king | date=25 June 1999 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A BBC poll to mark the 40th anniversary of the investiture showed that 58% of the Welsh population were in favour of a similar public ceremony for [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]] when Charles becomes king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8126785.stm | work=BBC News | title=Poll shows support for monarchy | date=30 June 2009 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll in July 2018 again found the majority of Welsh people support the title passing on when the current Prince becomes King, and, only 27% objected to another investiture.

On the evening of 28 June 2009—to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the investiture—BBC Parliament broadcast a repeat of the original BBC TV colour outside broadcast from 1 July 1969, fronted by [[Cliff Michelmore]] and [[Richard Baker (broadcaster)|Richard Baker]]. This was preceded by an interview with Prince Charles recorded a few days before his investiture.

In 2004 the museum took over the exhibits of the museum that was part of the [[Young People's Plaza]], designed by famous architect [[Kenzo Tange]].

== Excerpt from English Pamphlet ==

The standing exhibits of Ritsumeikan University's Kyoto Museum for World Peace are currently designed to emphasize the importance of [[peace]] primarily by covering the problems of [[war]] and the [[arms race]] and accurately portraying the suffering they bring about.  However, through its special exhibits, the Museum is also striving to extend its view to the problem of structural violence in an effort to contribute to the development of true peace.

The paradox is depicted as a U-curve, where the cost of a system is on the vertical axis, and the percentage of humanity that can access the system is on the horizontal axis. Acceptance{{clarify|date=June 2016}} of this paradox by the [[information security]] community was immediate{{when|date=June 2016}}, because it was consistent with the professional experiences of this group. Mayfield’s Paradox points out that, at some point of the curve, additional security becomes unrealistically expensive. Conversely, at some point of the curve, it becomes unrealistically expensive to add additional users.

Based on the Paradox the [[Menz brothers]] developed the "Menz Theorems of Information and Physical Security". The theorems present two formulas covering access and security of both information systems and physical facilities. They are used to help determine allocation of resources and response levels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39987">[[File:Cumbre de Washington.jpg|thumb|upright 1.20|Leaders of the [[G-20 major economies|G-20]] countries and others present at the [[2008 G-20 Washington summit]]. Most members of the G-20 are middle powers while some are [[great power]]s.]]
In [[international relations]], a '''middle power''' is a [[sovereign state]] that is not a [[superpower]] nor a [[great power]], but still has large or moderate influence and international recognition. The concept of the "middle power" dates back to the origins of the European state system. In the late 16th century, Italian political thinker [[Giovanni Botero]] divided the world into three types of states&amp;nbsp;– grandissime (empires), mezano (middle powers) and piccioli ([[small power]]s). According to Botero, a mezano or middle power "...has sufficient strength and authority to stand on its own without the need of help from others."&lt;ref name="Rudd"&gt;Rudd K (2006) [http://eherald.alp.org.au/articles/0906/natp28-01.php Making Australia a force for good], ''Labor eHerald'' {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627041402/http://eherald.alp.org.au/articles/0906/natp28-01.php|date=27 June 2007|df=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and definition==
No agreed standard method defines which states are middle powers. Some researchers use [[Gross National Product]] (GNP) statistics to draw lists of middle powers around the world. Economically, middle powers are generally those that are not considered too "big" or too "small," however that is defined. However, economics is not always the defining factor. Under the original sense of the term, a middle power was one that had some degree of influence globally, but did not dominate in any one area.  However, this usage is not universal, and some define middle power to include nations that can be regarded as [[regional power]]s.

According to academics at the [[University of Leicester]] and [[University of Nottingham]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;middle power status is usually identified in one of two ways. The traditional and most common way is to aggregate critical physical and material criteria to rank states according to their relative capabilities. Because countries' capabilities differ, they are categorized as superpowers (or great powers), middle powers or [[small power]]s. More recently, it is possible to discern a second method for identifying middle power status by focusing on behavioural attributes. This posits that middle powers can be distinguished from superpowers and smaller powers because of their [[foreign policy]] behaviour&amp;nbsp;– middle powers carve out a niche for themselves by pursuing a narrow range and particular types of foreign policy interest. In this way middle powers are countries that use their relative [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] skills in the service of international peace and stability. &lt;!-- reference broken: http://www.geocities.com/ibsaunb/africadosul02.pdf --&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Eduard Jordaan of [[Singapore Management University]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All middle powers display foreign policy behaviour that stabilises and legitimises the global order, typically through [[multilateralism|multilateral]] and cooperative initiatives. However, emerging and traditional middle powers can be distinguished in terms of their mutually-influencing constitutive and behavioural differences. Constitutively, traditional middle powers are wealthy, stable, [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]], [[Social democracy|social democratic]] and not regionally influential. Behaviourally, they exhibit a weak and ambivalent regional orientation, constructing identities distinct from powerful states in their regions and offer appeasing concessions to pressures for global reform. Emerging middle powers by contrast are semi-peripheral, materially inegalitarian and recently democratised states that demonstrate much regional influence and self-association. Behaviourally, they opt for reformist and not radical global change, exhibit a strong regional orientation favouring regional integration but seek also to construct identities distinct from those of the weak states in their region.&lt;ref name="Jordaan"&gt;Jordaan E (2003) [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a714856417?words=eduard|jordaan&amp;hash=2263085018 The concept of a middle power in international relations], ''informaworld''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another definition, by the Middle Power Initiative: "Middle power countries are politically and economically significant, internationally respected countries that have renounced  the nuclear arms race, a standing that give them significant international credibility."&lt;ref name="MPI"&gt;Middle Powers Initiative (2004) [http://www.gsinstitute.org/mpi/pubs/buildingbridges_0404.pdf Building Bridges: What Middle Power Countries Should Do To Strengthen the NPT], ''GSI''&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition however, nuclear-armed states like India and Pakistan, and every state participant of the [[NATO]] [[nuclear sharing]], would not be middle powers.

===Middle power diplomacy===
According to Laura Neak of the [[International Studies Association]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Although there is some conceptual ambiguity surrounding the term middle power, middle powers are identified most often by their international behavior–called 'middle power diplomacy'—the tendency to pursue multilateral solutions to international problems, the tendency to embrace compromise positions in international disputes, and the tendency to embrace notions of ‘good international citizenship’ to guide...diplomacy. Middle powers are states who commit their relative affluence, managerial skills, and international prestige to the preservation of the international order and peace. Middle powers help to maintain the international order through coalition-building, by serving as mediators and "go-betweens," and through international conflict management and resolution activities, such as UN peacekeeping. Middle powers perform these internationalist activities because of an idealistic imperative they associate with being a middle power. The imperative is that the middle powers have a moral responsibility and collective ability to protect the international order from those who would threaten it, including, at times, the great or principal powers. This imperative was particularly profound during the most intense periods of the Cold War.&lt;ref name="Bishai"&gt;Bishai LS (2000) [http://www.ciaonet.org/isa/nal01/ From Recognition to Intervention: The Shift from Traditional to Liberal International Law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020228031316/http://www.ciaonet.org/isa/nal01/|date=28 February 2002|df=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to international relations scholar [[Annette Baker Fox]], relationships between middle powers and great powers reveal more intricate behaviors and bargaining schemes than has often been assumed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annette Baker Fox|Fox, Annette Baker]], ''The Politics of Attraction: Four Middle Powers and the United States'' (Columbia University Press, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Soeya Yoshihide, "Middle Power does not just mean a state’s size or military or economic power. Rather, 'middle power diplomacy' is defined by the issue area where a state invests its resources and knowledge. Middle Power States avoid a direct confrontation with great powers, but they see themselves as ‘moral actors’ and seek their  own role in particular issue areas, such as human rights, environment, and arms regulations. Middle powers are the driving force in the process of transnational institutional-building."&lt;ref name="Yoshihide"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yoshihide|first=Soeya|title=Middle Power Diplomacy|url=http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/tiberg/Poli%20322-2006-Middle%20Power%20Diplomacy.rtf|accessdate=2006}}{{Dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics of middle power diplomacy include:&lt;ref name="Yoshihide"/&gt;

*Commitment to [[multilateralism]] through global institutions and allying with other middle powers.&lt;ref name="JamesKasoff2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrick James|author2=Mark J. Kasoff|title=Canadian studies in the new millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_LHcv89nW4C&amp;pg=PA265|year=2008|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-9468-1|page=265|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*High degree of [[civil society]] penetration in the country's foreign policy.
*A country that reflects and forms its national identity through a 'novel foreign policy': [[Peacekeeping]], Human Security, the [[International Criminal Court]], and the [[Kyoto Protocol]]

The [[Middle Powers Initiative]] (MPI), a program of the [[Global Security Institute]], highlights the importance of middle powers diplomacy. Through MPI, eight international non-governmental organizations are able to work primarily with middle power governments to encourage and educate the nuclear weapons states to take immediate practical steps that reduce nuclear dangers, and commence negotiations to eliminate nuclear weapons. Middle power countries are particularly influential in issues related to arms control, being that they are politically and economically significant, internationally respected countries that have renounced the [[nuclear arms race]], a standing that gives them significant political credibility.

===Self-defined by nation states===
The term first entered Canadian political discourse after [[World War II]]. [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Louis St. Laurent]], for example called [[Canada]] "a power of the middle rank" and helped to lay out the classical definition of Canadian middle power diplomacy.  When he was advocating for Canada's election to the [[United Nations Security Council]], he said that while "...the special nature of [Canada's] relationship to the United Kingdom and the United States complicates our responsibilities," Canada was not a "[[Satellite state|satellite]]" of either but would "continue to make our decisions objectively, in the light of our obligations to our own people and their interest in the welfare of the international community."&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Herstien,  L.J. Hughes, R.C. Kirbyson. ''Challenge &amp; Survival: The History of Canada'' (Scarborough, ON: Prentice-Hall, 1970). p 411&lt;/ref&gt;  Canadian leaders believed Canada was a middle power because it was a junior partner in larger alliances (e.g. [[NATO]], [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]]), was actively involved in resolving disputes outside its own region (e.g. [[Suez Crisis]]), was not a former colonial power and therefore neutral in anti-colonial struggles, worked actively in the [[United Nations]] to represent the interests of smaller nations and to prevent the dominance of the superpowers (often being elected to the [[United Nations Security Council]] for such reasons), and because it was involved in humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts around the world.

In March 2008, [[Australia]]n [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Kevin Rudd]] defined his country's foreign policy as one of "middle power diplomacy", along the lines of similar criteria. Australia would "influence international decision-makers" on issues such as "global economic, security and environmental challenges".&lt;ref name="Shanahan"&gt;Shanahan D (2008) [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23437898-2702,00.html Time to go global, urges Rudd], ''The Australian''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overlaps between great powers and middle powers==
The overlaps between the lists of middle powers and great powers show that there is no unanimous agreement among authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Mehmet Ozkan. "A NEW APPROACH TO GLOBAL SECURITY: PIVOTAL MIDDLE POWERS AND GLOBAL POLITICS" Perceptions: Journal of International Affairs XI.1 (2006): 77-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Nations such as the [[United States]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Russia]] and the [[United Kingdom]] are generally considered to be [[great power|great powers]] due to their economic, military or strategic importance, their status as [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|recognised]] [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear powers]] and their permanent seats on the [[United Nations Security Council]]. [[Japan]] and [[Germany]] are great powers too, though due to their large advanced economies rather than their strategic and [[hard power]] capabilities (i.e., the lack of permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council or strategic military reach).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Encarta - The Great Powers|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761590309/Great_Powers.html|work=|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257037071915226|archivedate=2009-11-01|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet sources have at times referred to these nations as middle powers.&lt;ref name="European Security After 9/11'"&gt;P.

==List of middle powers==
As with the great powers, there is no unanimous agreement among authorities as to which countries are considered middle powers. Lists are often the subject of much debate and tend to place comparatively large countries (e.g. [[Argentina]]) alongside relatively smaller ones (e.g. [[Norway]]).&lt;ref name="Solomon"/&gt; Clearly not all middle powers are of equal status; some are considered [[regional power]]s and members of the [[G-20 major economies|G20]] (e.g. [[Australia]]), while others could very easily be considered [[small power]]s (e.g. [[Czech Republic]]). Some larger middle powers also play important roles in the [[United Nations]] and other international organisations such as the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]].

The following is a list of countries that have been, at some point in time, considered middle powers by academics or other experts:

The '''Movement for the Return of Constitutional Legitimacy in Libya''' is a movement gaining momentum throughout [[Libya]] to advocate for the reinstatement of the [[Constitution of Libya (1951)|1951 Constitution]] and the restoration of the historic Senussi monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://alwasat.ly/ar/news/libya/100650/|title=دعوة لمبايعة الأمير محمد السنوسي ملكًا على ليبيا|last=|first=|date=|work=بوابة الوسط|access-date=2017-10-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the 1951 Constitution emerged from the instability and chaos created by the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libyan Civil War]], during which time the country grew divided across political, tribal, regional and ideological lines. The movement views the 1951 Constitution as the viable and credible path towards a democratic, unified, and independent new Libya. Furthermore, the movement holds that Prince [[Mohammed El Senussi]] should assume leadership as the legitimate heir to Senussi throne.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.constitutionnet.org/country/constitutional-history-libya|title=Constitutional history of Libya|work=ConstitutionNet|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affiliated [[grassroots]] campaigns termed as Movements for the Return of Constitutional Legitimacy are happening on the ground in major cities such as [[Tripoli]], [[Benghazi]], [[Zliten]], [[Kufra]], [[Misurata|Misrata]], [[Sabha, Libya|Sebha]], Jebel Akhdar, [[Al Khums|Khums]], [[Nalut]], [[Jadu, Libya|Jadu]], [[Sabratha|Sebratha]], [[‘Aziziya|Aziziya]], Ghyrian and Karabulli.

== 1951 Libya Constitution ==

The pre-revolutionary Constitution, instituted in December 1951 and later amended in 1963, was drafted by the [[General National Congress|Libyan National Assembly]] under the aegis of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It established a constitutional and hereditary monarchy under the leadership of [[Idris of Libya|King Idris I]] of Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://24dec1951.com/index.php/libya/the-senussi-family|title=The Senussi Family|last=|first=|date=|website=24dec1951.com|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1951 Constitution is viewed by the Libyan people as a symbol of the freedom and independence the country achieved in post-war Libya. It is based upon a [[Democracy|democratic]] system of government with a representative [[parliament]]ary system under a constitutional monarchy. Many of the 1951 Constitution’s articles established a set of fundamental rights for its citizens, including [[Civil and political rights|civil]], [[Civil and political rights|political]], and [[Right to property|property rights]], freedom of thought and speech, religious tolerance and universal adult [[suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://24dec1951.com/index.php/libya/the-libyan-constitution|title=Libyan Constitution|last=|first=|date=|website=24dec1951.com|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 11 of the 1951 Constitution safeguards [[human rights]]:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://24dec1951.com/index.php/libya/the-libyan-constitution/chapter-ii|title=Chapter II|last=|first=|date=|website=24dec1951.com|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Libyans shall be equal before the law. They shall enjoy equal civil and political rights, shall have the same opportunities, and be subject to the same public duties and obligations, without distinction of religion, belief, race, language, wealth, kinship or political or social opinions.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;Additionally, Article 12 holds that “Personal liberty shall be guaranteed and everyone shall be entitled to equal protection of the law.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Article 21 protects rights with respect to religion:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Freedom of conscience shall be absolute. The State shall respect all religions and faiths and shall ensure to foreigners residing in its territory freedom of conscience and the right freely to practice religion so long as it is not a breach of public order and is not contrary to morality.”   &lt;/blockquote&gt;Freedom of speech and opinion both publicly and in the press are protected in Articles 22 – 26:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;“Freedom of thought shall be guaranteed. Everyone shall have the right to express his opinion and to publish it by all means and methods. But this freedom may not be abused in any way which is contrary to public order and morality.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Freedom of press and of printing shall be guaranteed within the limits of the law.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Everyone shall be free to use any language in his private transactions or religious or cultural matters or in the Press or any other publications or in public meetings.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“The right of peaceful meetings is guaranteed within the limits of law.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Senussi monarchy ==

In 1837, [[Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi]] established the Senussi political-religious [[tariqa]] ([[Sufism|Sufi]] order) in [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;cc=acls;view=toc;idno=heb00880.0001.001|title=The Sanusi of Cyrenaica|last=Evans-Pritchard|first=E. E. (Edward Evan) 1902-1973|date=1954|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi's grandson, who assumed the leadership of the Senussi order in 1917, became [[Idris of Libya|King Idris]] of Libya in 1951.

For over a century after its founding, the Senussi monarchy played a unifying role in Libya and continues to be regarded as a fundamental part of the country’s history, helping to protect it from [[French colonial empire|French colonial expansion]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy|Kingdom of Italy’s]] colonization in the early 1900s along with playing a crucial role against forces in [[North Africa]] during [[World War II]].

The monarchy was in place from 1951 until [[Muammar Gaddafi|Colonel Muammar Gaddafi’s]] [[1969 Libyan coup d'état|coup]] in 1969 and brought stability and good governance to Libya.

=== Heir to the Senussi throne ===

Libyan royalists view Prince [[Mohammed El Senussi]], great-nephew of King Idris, as the legitimate heir to the Senussi throne. In 1992, El Senussi’s ailing father, then Crown Prince [[Hasan as-Senussi]], appointed him as successor to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/med-south/news/heir-to-libyan-throne-under-brussels-spotlight/|title=Heir to Libyan throne under Brussels spotlight|website=EURACTIV.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the strife of the Libyan crisis, Mohammed El Senussi has vocalized his patriotism and advocated for a more prosperous Libya. He has commented on many Libyan matters through the years and has supported activists throughout the civil war.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newstimeafrica.com/archives/16512|title=Exiled Libyan Crown Prince says Kadhafi must step down {{!}} Newstime Africa|website=www.newstimeafrica.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking out in 2011 against actions perpetrated by the Ghaddafi regime, El Senussi said: “I ask the international community to put pressure on Ghaddafi to stop killing his own people […] anything to stop the killing of my people, and to put pressure on Ghaddafi. It’s for them to decide.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In response to questions about returning to power, El Senussi stated “I see myself as a servant to the Libyan people. They will decide what they want. My goal is to serve my people as much as I can.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A cousin of El Senussi, [[Idris bin Abdullah al-Senussi]], claims that he is the rightful heir to the throne, although this claim is speculative given that he seems to be only distantly related to King Idris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8974054/Libyan-heir-to-the-throne-returns-home.html|title=Libyan 'heir to the throne' returns home|last=Blair|first=David|date=2011-12-23|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|access-date=2017-10-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support inside Libya ==

=== Leadership ===

Multiple authority figures throughout Libya have publicly championed a return of the 1951 Constitution under the leadership of Mohammed El Senussi.

In July 2015, multiple members of the Constitutional Drafting Authority (CDA), the body tasked with drafting a constitution, signed a petition demanding the return of the 1951 Constitution and monarchy, arguing this is the only solution to the crisis in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/605483792899854/photos/a.605722619542638.1073741829.605483792899854/870884159693148/?type=1|title=حراك العودة للشرعية الدستورية _ الجبل الأخضر|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alarabiya.net/ar/north-africa/libya/2015/07/30/%D9%85%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84%D9%83%D9%8A.html|title=مطالبات ليبية بتفعيل #الدستور_الملكي|website=www.alarabiya.net|language=ar|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same month, the Mayor of the large Libyan city of [[Bayda, Libya|Al Baidha]] publicly released a formal letter proclaiming his support for the 1951 Constitution as a tool to ensure stability and security during a time when so many Libyan citizens were being killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10207484185164202&amp;id=1275722978|title=Ashraf Boudouara|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, the Federal Bloc asked the [[House of Representatives (Libya)|House of Representatives]] to endorse the 1951 Constitution “warning that if this demand is not answered it will delegate parliament members from [[Cyrenaica]] to reinstate the constitution within the region and to take the necessary action to achieve this.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://alwasat.ly/ar/news/libya/85676/|title=التكتل الفيدرالي يدعو إلى اعتماد دستور 1951 ويحذر من عدم الاستجابة|last=|first=|date=|work=بوابة الوسط|access-date=2017-10-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 interview with ''[[Al-Hayat]]'', Libyan Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Mohamed Abdelaziz (Libyan politician)|Mohamed Abdelaziz]], proclaimed that he would “take it upon himself” to call for reinstatement of the monarchy, and furthermore that it was “his right as a citizen first and foremost, before being a minister.” He expressed his belief that a return to monarchy would be a “political umbrella” to unite the country:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2014/04/libya-foreign-minister-interview-return-monarchy.html|title=Libya Foreign Minister calls for return of monarchy|last=Cheaib|first=Ali|date=2014-04-08|work=Al-Monitor|access-date=2017-10-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;“I am not talking about a king who rules, but about a symbolic figure like in [[Belgium]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Spain]]. When we talk about royal legitimacy, we mean centrist values, the Senussi movement and the history and loyalty for late King Idris al-Senussi.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Social media presence throughout cities ===

Groups across cities in Libya referring to themselves as Movements for the Return of Constitutional Legitimacy are well-documented and have gathered a significant following on social media.

The movement in Libya’s capital city of [[The Movement for the Return of Constitutional Legitimacy - Tripoli|Tripoli]] has gathered thousands of followers on its Facebook page. The movement regularly shares relevant events, articles, press releases, speeches, and other activity advocating for the return of the monarchy and 1951 Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%83-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-_-%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%B3-317037058450330/|title=Security Check Required|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Movement for the return of Constitutional Legitimacy - Jebel Akhdar|Jebel Akhdar]]’s movement has almost 7,000 active followers, and the movement active the city of [[Movement for the Return of Constitutional Legitimacy – Zliten|Zliten]] has close to 15,000 social media followers.

''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article in February 2016 suggesting that a restoration of the monarchy would “let Libyans rally behind a respected father figure and begin to rebuild their splintered nation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/world/middleeast/a-radical-idea-to-rebuild-a-shattered-libya-restore-the-monarchy.html|title=A Radical Idea to Rebuild a Shattered Libya: Restore the Monarchy|last=Walsh|first=Declan|date=2016-02-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Kawczynski]], a [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]] member in the [[Member of parliament|British Parliament]], wrote a June 2015 article in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' stating “if the people of Libya succeed in restoring their 1951 Constitution, they would put in place a tolerant, rights-based, democratic system of government, with a constitutional monarchy that would be a model for the region.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/06/where-next-libya|title=Where next for Libya?|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, ''[[The National Interest]]'' published an article titled “The Case for Monarchy in Libya.” It described the varying tribal relations from among regions, which cause a splintered Libyan society, and asserts that the solution to unification “can be found in Libya’s past, before a twenty-seven-year-old [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] launched his [[Cultural Revolution (Libya)|Green Revolution]] and turned the country’s political system to dust: constitutional monarchy.” It also mentions the “considerable influence” the Senussi family – King Idris specifically – had on commanding respect from the various tribes and strains of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-case-monarchy-libya-10867?page=2|title=The Case for Monarchy in Libya|last=Varga|first=Mark|date=2014-07-14|work=The National Interest|access-date=2017-10-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1967">'''Nebuchadnezzar III''' ruled over [[Babylon]] (c. 522 BC). He claimed to be the second son of [[Nabonidus]].

He led a short-lived rebellion against [[Darius I of Persia]], who routed his army in battle at the [[Tigris]] on December 13, 522 BC, and then at the [[Euphrates]] near Zazannu.&lt;ref name="UniversityGoold1972"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harvard University|author2=G.

Darius subsequently besieged the high-walled city of Babylon, succeeding in taking the capital, and Nebuchadnezzar III was put to death.&lt;ref name="Holland2007" /&gt;

His exact identity is uncertain. According to the [[Behistun Inscription]], Darius claimed that he was an impostor called Nidinta-Bel, but some historians consider that he probably did have some connection with the previous Babylonian royal family.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

He should not be confused with [[Nebuchadnezzar IV]], who led a similar revolt against the [[Persian people|Persians]] around a year later.

'''New Public Administration''' is an [[Antipositivism|anti-positivist]], anti-technical, and anti-hierarchical reaction against [[Public administration#History|traditional public administration]]. A practiced theory in response to the ever changing needs of the public and how institutions and administrations go about solving them. Focus is on the role of government and how they can provide these services to citizens in which are a part of public interest, by means, but not limited to public policy.

== History  ==
New Public Administration traces its origins to the first Minnowbrook Conference held in 1968 under the patronage of [[Dwight Waldo]]. This conference brought together the top scholars in public administration and management to discuss and reflect on the state of the field and its future.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary, Rosemary. &amp; Slyke, David M. Van. &amp; Kim, Soonhee. The Future of Public Administration around the World: The Minnowbrook Perspective. Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1960s in the USA was a time of [[1960s#Social and political movements|unusual social and political turbulence and upheaval]].  In this context, Waldo concluded that neither the study nor the practice of public administration was responding suitably to the escalating turmoil and the complications that arose from those conditions. Part of the reasoning for this Waldo argued, was the general mistrust that had become associated with public administration itself.  A call to revamp the ethical obligations of the service sector was necessary in rebuilding the public's trust of government and bureaucracy in which had been plagued by corruption and the narrow self interests of others.  Moving toward a more ethical public service, then, required attention to the underlying values that support public service-and public servants-in any sector.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Getha-Taylor|first=Heather|title=Where's (Dwight) Waldo?|journal=Public Performance &amp; Management Review|date=June 2009|volume=32|series=No. 4|pages=574–578|doi=10.2753/pmr1530-9576320406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[new public management]](npm) did not offer public servants an alternative model to help them resolve emerging conflicts and tensions. Concepts of citizenship, democracy or public interest have evolved over time and they are continuing to evolve. Consequently, the role of government and the role of the public service are being transformed in ways that push beyond the constraints of the Classic model he lenses of varying perspectives can challenge, clarify, and create a history that boasts enough depth to serve as not only a history in a traditional sense but also an interactive timeline that ignites constant improvement. At its core, public service requires a vision that extends beyond narrow self-interest.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Waldo sees public administration and bureaucracy as integrally bound to civilization and to our culture in two senses: the evolution of civilization itself was dependent upon public administration and related concepts are constitutive elements within out specific civilization and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martini|first=Frank|title=Leaders in the Field: Dwight Waldo|journal=Public Administration Review|date=1993|volume=53|series=September/October|issue=5|pages=409–418|doi=10.2307/976341|jstor=976341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Public Administration theory deals with the following issues''':
* '''Democratic citizenship'''; Refers directly to the belief in creating a government where the "common man" has a voice in politics. For such an approach to work, citizens must become aware, knowledgeable, and active in their communities and nations. True democratic citizenship requires more than voting for representatives. It requires using one's own mind, voice, and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chilcoat,G.W.|first=&amp; Ligon J.A.|title="It is democratic citizens we are after:" The curriculum orientation of Shirley H. Engle's approach to social studies education.|journal=Submitted to the International Journal of Social Education|date=February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Public interest'''; Refers to the collective common good within society, to which is the main objective of public     interest. 
* '''Public policy'''; The means by which new public policy is enacted, and introduced. Not limited in participation of the public but encouraged involvement.  
*'''Services to citizens'''; Providing and upholding the moral and ethical standard in regards to meeting the needs of citizens  through institutions and bureaucracies.

First, a ‘new’ theory should start with the ideal of democratic citizenship. The public service derives its true meaning from its mandate to serve citizens to advance the public good. This is the raison d’être of the institution, the source of motivation and pride of all those who choose to make it their life, whether for a season or for an entire career.

== Main Features of new public administration ==
These are:
# '''Responsiveness''': The administration should bring about certain internal as well as external changes so that public administration could be made more relevant to the social, economic, political and technological environment. For this to happen the administration has to be more flexible and adaptable to the various changes.
# '''Client Centricity''': this means that the effectiveness of the administrator should be judged not only from the point of view of the government, but from that of the citizens. If the administrative actions did not improve the quality of life of citizens then they are not effective notwithstanding whatsoever rationality and efficiency they may have.
# '''Structural Changes in Administration''': the new public administration approach calls for small, flexible and less hierarchical structures In administration so that the citizens administration interface could become more flexible and comfortable. The organizational structure should be in with the socially relevant conditions.
# '''Multi-disciplinary Nature of Public Administration''': knowledge from several disciplines and not just one dominating paradigm build the discipline of public administration. The political, social, economic, management and human relation approaches are needed to ensure the growth of discipline.
# '''[[Politics-Administration Dichotomy]]''' since administrators today are involved in policy formulation and policy implementation at all the stages. Dichotomy meaning "a division or contrast between two things that are or are represented as being opposed or entirely different".
# '''Awareness''': Bring attention to the works of a public administration and the task that public administrators carry out for the community and for the government. Jobs of public administrators affect communities and large numbers of people. The importance of the job should be highlighted.
# '''Case Studies''': Case studies help public administrators highlight situations and events where policies were not carried out as they should be. They set an example for what to do and what not to do. Case studies are a basic way to break down events in order to learn from other people’s mistakes and the affects those mistakes have had on the community. With public administration being a job devoted to the people; it is an obvious way to see the reality of the work you do in the community. While there are many cases where policies were not carried out as planned. There are also plenty of examples of executed policies that have benefited communities, and those are important to look at as well.
# '''Structure Change''': Public Administration is moving is many different directions, it is more often called Public Management now. This is because the job is moving towards a direction of not only implementing policy to people but also managing policies as it trickles down through the law process, so that it is realistic for communities and the people in them.
# '''Jack of All Trades''': the best public administrators tend to be someone who has knowledge in politics and law, but also has a hand in community functions. This allows for a smooth transition from policy to implementation.
# '''Change''': With the changes in the world, the job of public administration has changed. The job may be the same, but titles like Public Manager and Public Adviser have replaced the title Public Administrator.

== Themes ==
#'''Relevance''': Traditional public administration has too little interest in contemporary problems and issues. Social realities must be taken into consideration. i.e. people should see changes as relevant meaning thereby that changes should be specific to the needs of the area and the need of the people. Earlier approaches to NPA considered that rationality of the people was neglected. NPA suggests the inclusion of rationality of the people too in the process of policy formulation.
#'''Values''': Value-neutrality in public administration is an impossibility. The values being served through administrative action must be transparent.To practice transparency in public administration is to ensure citizens the availability of information which is deemed public. This should be an organizational goal, and is to be taken into account when conducting all public business regardless of one’s job title. If the goal of an organization is to serve the citizens to the best of their ability, then avoiding or failing to achieve transparency would cause significant damage to the relationship between them and the people they are aiming to serve.
#'''[[Social equity|Social Equity]]''': Realization of social equity should be a chief goal of public administration.
#'''Change''': Skepticism toward the deeply rooted powers invested in permanent institutions and the status quo. Operational flexibility and organisational adaptability to meet the environmental changes should be in-built in the administrative system.
#'''Client Focus''': Positive, proactive, and responsive administrators rather than inaccessible and authoritarian "[[ivory tower]]" bureaucrats.
#'''Management-Worker relations.''' There should be equal emphasis both on efficiency and humane considerations. The new approach has to satisfy both the efficiency and the human relations criterion in order to achieve success.

NPA provides solutions for achieving these goals, popularly called 4 D's i.e. Decentralisation, Debureaucratisation, Delegation and Democratisation.

== Criticism ==
Though New Public Administration brought public administration closer to political science, it was criticized as anti-theoretic and anti-management. Robert T. Golembiewski describes it as radicalism in words and status quo in skills and technologies. Further, it must be counted as only a cruel reminder of the gap in the field between aspiration and performance. Golembiewski considers it as a temporary and transitional phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Golembiewski|first=Robert|title=Public Administration as a Developing Discipline|date=1 August 1977|publisher=CRC Press|location=New York, New York|pages=118–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, we can say that the solutions for achieving the goals and anti-goals were not provided by the NPA scholars explicitly. Secondly, how much one should decentralize or delegate or debureaucratize or democratize in order to achieve the goals? On this front NPA is totally silent.

As said in ''A New Synthesis of Public Administration,'' governments have always been called upon to make difficult decisions, undertake complicated initiatives and face complex problems characteristics of the period. This is not in dispute. Nonetheless, the current circumstances is to determine what can be handled in the traditional way and what must be done differently.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/973347|jstor=973347|title=Needed: New Expertise in Public Administration|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=27|issue=4|pages=321|year=1967|last1=Banovetz|first1=James M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments have always been called upon to face difficult problems. Setting priorities and making choices have always been difficult. For example, eliminating a sizable deficit is “merely” a difficult problem, although it is hard to believe when one is in the middle of such a heart-wrenching exercise. This entails making choices among equally deserving public purposes and making tough decisions about what should be preserved for the future. It requires reconciling future needs with what could garner a sufficient degree of public support in the short term to move forward. Academic public administration has lagged considerably behind practicing public administration. Improved curricula and a refocusing of emphasis upon the policy dynamics of government administration will be important factors in enticing more students to study of public administration. It is more important to increase the number and improving the geographic spread of universities with public affairs programs, integrating public affairs components into the curricula of other graduate and professional programs, developing many more in-service, mid-career educational programs for public servants, and utilizing existing resources to strengthen public affairs programs.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The motives behind the promotion of New Public Administration is also in question in the case of [[Hong Kong]]. As [[Anthony Cheung]] argues, officials often employed the rhetoric of New Public Administration to roll back public expenditure and decrease welfare provision in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cheung | first=Anthony B. L. |date= 1996 | title=Efficiency As the Rhetoric: Public-Sector Reform in Hong Kong Explained | journal=[[International Review of Administrative Sciences]] | volume= 62 | issue=  | pages=43 | url= | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Governors at that time used the excuse of administrative efficiency to curtail the power of the bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cheung | first=Anthony B. L. |date= 1992 | title=Public Sector Reform in Hong Kong: Perspectives and Problems | journal=Asian Journal of Public Administration | volume= 14 | issue=2 | pages=141 | url= | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
[[Felix A. Nigro|Felix]] and [[Lloyd Nigro]] observe that New Public Administration has seriously jolted the traditional concepts and outlook of the discipline and enriched the subject by imparting a wider perspective by linking it closely to the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nigro|first=Lloyd|title=New Public Personnel Administration|date=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=1133734286|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The overall focus in NPA movement seems to be to make administration to be less "generic" and more "public", less "descriptive" and more "prescriptive", less "institution-oriented" and more "client-oriented", less "neutral" and more "normative" but should be no less scientific all the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1232">In [[voting theory]], '''non-dictatorship''' is a property of [[social choice function]]s which requires that the results of voting cannot simply mirror that of any single person's preferences without consideration of the other voters.

The property of non-dictatorship is satisfied if there is no single voter ''i'' with the individual preference order P, such that P is always the societal ("winning") preference order. With other words, the preferences of individual ''i'' should not always prevail.

Blind voting systems (with at least two voters) automatically satisfy the non-dictatorship property.

==Arrow's impossibility theorem==
Non-dictatorship is one of the necessary conditions in [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;''Game Theory'' Second Edition Guillermo Owen Ch 6 pp124-5 Axiom 5 Academic Press, 1982 {{ISBN|0-12-531150-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Social Choice and Individual Values]]'', [[Kenneth Arrow]] defines non-dictatorship as:
:There is no voter ''i'' in {''1'', ..., ''n''} such that for every set of orderings in the domain of the constitution and every pair of social states ''x'' and ''y'', ''x &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; y'' implies ''x P y''.

{{Property law}}
A '''nonpossessory interest in land''' is a term of the [[law]] of [[property]] to describe any of a category of rights held by one person to use land that is in the possession of another. Such rights can generally be created in one of two ways: either by an express agreement between the party who owns the land and the party who seeks to own the interest; or by an order of a [[court]].

Under the [[common law]], there are five variations of such rights. These are:
*[[easements]]
*[[profit (real estate)|profits]]
*[[restrictive covenants]]
*[[equitable servitudes]], and
*[[licenses]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8954">'''Normalization''' refers to social processes through which ideas and actions come to be seen as '[[normality (behavior)|normal]]' and become taken-for-granted or 'natural' in everyday life. In [[sociological theory]], normalization appears in two forms.
First, the concept of normalization is found in the work of [[Michel Foucault]], especially ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'', in the context of his account of disciplinary power.  As Foucault used the term, normalization involved the construction of an idealized norm of conduct &amp;ndash; for example, the way a proper soldier ideally should stand, march, present arms, and so on, as defined in minute detail &amp;ndash; and then rewarding or punishing individuals for respectively conforming to or deviating from this ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel, 1990. ''The History of Sexuality, Volume I: An Introduction''. Robert Hurley, trans. New York: Vintage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Mary Louise, 2004. "The Trouble with Normal: Postwar Youth and the Making of Heterosexuality". In Michelle Webber and Kate Bezanson, eds., ''Rethinking Society in the 21st Century: Critical Readings in Sociology''.  Canadian Scholars' Press Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In Foucault's account, normalization was one of an ensemble of tactics for exerting the maximum [[social control]] with the minimum expenditure of force, which Foucault calls "disciplinary power".  Disciplinary power emerged over the course of the 19th century, came to be used extensively in military barracks, hospitals, asylums, schools, factories, offices, and so on, and hence became a crucial aspect of [[social structure]] in modern societies.

Second, [[normalization process theory]]&lt;ref&gt;May C, Mair FS, Finch T, MacFarlane A, Dowrick C, Treweek S, et al. Development of a theory of implementation and integration: Normalization Process Theory. Implementation Science. 2009;4 art 29&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range theory]] used mainly in [[medical sociology]] and [[Science, technology and society|science and technology studies]] to provide a framework for understanding the social processes by which new ways of thinking, working and organizing become routinely incorporated in everyday work. Normalization process theory has its roots in empirical studies of [[technological innovation]] in healthcare, and especially in the evaluation of complex [[Health intervention|interventions]].

There are different behavioral attitudes humans accept as normal, such as grief for a loved one, avoiding danger, and not participating in [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What's Normal?: Reconciling Biology and Culture|last=Horwitz|first=Allan|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=197|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences of behavior ==
The world is constantly changing and many things can change the situation an individual is in. Many [[Social influence|influences]] such as past experiences, environment, mental strength, physical strength, people, and the media can affect a person's behavior.  A person can decide to let certain things influence them. This will determine if the person is able to make a decision rationally or not. Some people fail to see the effects of their actions after letting influences affect their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://behaviorandmotivation.com/2011/08/21/sources-of-influence-your-life/|title=9 Sources of Influence in Your Life|last=Milford|first=Scott|date=2011-08-21|website=Behavior and Motivation|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mood and emotions ===
People can greatly be affected by their [[Mood (psychology)|mood]]. One's judgement and [[emotional well-being]] is influenced by one's mood. A negative mood can cause someone to be unproductive and it will show in the person's performance. Positive moods can make a person be more active and productive.  If the person is well emotion-wise, they are full of energy and are able to stay positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Boundless|date=2016-05-26|title=How Emotion and Mood Influence Behavior|url=https://www.boundless.com/management/textbooks/boundless-management-textbook/organizational-behavior-5/drivers-of-behavior-44/how-emotion-and-mood-influence-behavior-233-7047/|work=Boundless}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child development ===
Children are known for developing behaviors based on family, friends and media influences. A child may not know what they were doing is right or wrong. They must be able to learn from experiences if their actions are right or wrong. It is the parent's job to teach the child whether it is socially accepted or not. As the child develops from a child to a young adult, most of their influence will come from their friends. It will become harder for parents to tell how the child behaves as the child grows older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oureverydaylife.com/normal-child-behavior-development-2386.html|title=Normal Child Behavior &amp; Development|work=Our Everyday Life|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role models ===
Young adults and teenagers are heavily affected by looking up to [[role model]]s. Young adults are influenced to act, talk, dress and behave similarly to their role models. This can either be a positive or negative for the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/science/factors-affect-human-behavior-3512986d01e403d4#|title=What are the factors that affect human behavior?|work=Reference|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking up to a role model can have positive effects, as may influence young adults to strive for success and it brings the best out of the person to do well. Positive role models are people able to overcome obstacles, inspire others, and achievements of success. However, negative role models may model bad behaviors like bullying, drug usage, and cheating, which may lead to failure rather than success. Young adults may learn to avoid problems rather than solve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rootsofaction.com/role-models-youth-strategies-success/|title=How Role Models Influence Youth Strategies for Success|date=2014-01-14|newspaper=Roots of Action|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problems with blindly copying a role model is that people start to lose a sense of identity.

== Types of normal behavior ==

=== Grief ===
[[Grief]] is the deep sorrow usually caused by someone's death. It has now become a normal human reaction to a loss of a loved one. It is not uncommon for someone to be in sadness. Many have to deal with [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with grief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.griefrecoverymethod.com/blog/2013/06/best-grief-definition-you-will-find|title=The Best Grief Definition You Will Find|last=Friedman|first=Russell|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body markings ===
Body markings such as [[tattoo]]s and [[piercing]]s were once considered unaccepted, many people today use body markings as a form of expression. It is not uncommon to see doctors, lawyers, soldiers, police officers, and other professionals to have them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/anthropology-and-archaeology/customs-and-artifacts/body-marking|title=body-marking facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about body-marking|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homosexuality ===
During the 1900s [[homosexuality]] was not accepted as a normal behavior and people attracted to the same gender were considered different and were heavily discriminated against. Over the years, it has now been accepted in places such as the United States, Canada and other places around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.norc.org/NewsEventsPublications/PressReleases/Pages/american-acceptance-of-homosexuality-gss-report.aspx|title=Americans Move Dramatically Toward Acceptance of Homosexuality {{!}} NORC.org|website=www.norc.org|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laughter ===
Laughter signals acceptance and trust in a group. This is often why laughter is contagious, and explains why people are unlikely to laugh alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://listverse.com/2013/07/11/10-human-actions-with-biological-explanations-2/|title=10 Common Human Behaviors Explained With Science|date=2013-07-11|website=Listverse|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of abnormal behavior ==
[[Abnormal behavior]] is broken up to two types: atypical and maladaptive. Atypical behavior is not necessarily harmful, but maladaptive behavior could potentially be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite work|url=https://www.reference.com/world-view/different-types-abnormal-behaviour-778d1d5311f4dd6f#|title=What are the different types of abnormal behaviour?|work=Reference|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pavel Alekseyevich Astakhov''' ({{lang-ru|Па́вел Алексе́евич Аста́хов}}) (born 8 September 1966 in [[Moscow]]&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;) is a [[Russia]]n [[politician]], [[celebrity]] [[lawyer]] and [[television personality]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

On 30 December 2009 [[Dmitry Medvedev]] named Astakhov as the Children's Rights Commissioner for the President of the Russian Federation ([[children's ombudsman]]).&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eur/136054.htm |title=2009 Human Rights Report: Russia |date=11 March 2010 |work=Official website of the [[United States Department of State|US Department of State]] |accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the job in September 2016 after facing severe criticism due to his comments on the death of [[Lake Syamozero#2016 boat disaster|14 children in a shipwreck]].&lt;ref name=yle210916&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yle.fi/uutiset/venajalla_huolestuttiin_jalleen_lasten_huostaanotoista_suomessa/9181876 | title =Venäjällä huolestuttiin jälleen lasten huostaanotoista Suomessa | author = Heikki Heiskanen| date = 21 September 2016| work = [[Yleisradio|Yle.fi]], News| accessdate= 22 May 2017 |language = fi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

Astakhov graduated from the law faculty of the Dzerzhinsky [[KGB]] School in Moscow in 1991.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=rp/&gt; In 2002 he received a [[Master of Laws]] from the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Law]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.rfdeti.ru/content.php?id=12 |title=Pavel A. Astakhov |work=Official website of the Children's Rights Commissioner for the President of the Russian Federation |accessdate=7 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309110944/http://english.rfdeti.ru/content.php?id=12 |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Astakhov received a [[Doctor of Laws]] in Russia. Firstly the community [[Dissernet]], then the [[Russian State Library]] tested his doctoral thesis for plagiarism and discovered that only 0.68% of the text was original work, the remainder having been copy-pasted from other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cook.livejournal.com/254442.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128063135/http://cook.livejournal.com/254442.html |archivedate=28 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.dissernet.org/index.php/DISSERNET.ORG:Ast2006 Published results of the expertise of Pavel Astakhov’s thesis on Dissernet server] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314160127/http://wiki.dissernet.org/index.php/DISSERNET.ORG:Ast2006 |date=14 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He speaks English, Swedish, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese and French as well as Russian.&lt;ref name=rp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://russiaprofile.org/background/resources_whoiswho_alphabet_a_astakhov/print_edition/ |title=Astakhov, Pavel Alekseyevich |date=9 July 2010 |work=Russia Profile |accessdate=7 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227094235/http://russiaprofile.org/background/resources_whoiswho_alphabet_a_astakhov/print_edition/ |archivedate=27 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawyer==

Astakhov began practising law in 1991.&lt;ref name=rp/&gt; In 1994 he became a member of the Moscow [[Bar association|Bar]] and set up his own law firm, which has been known since 2003 as "Pavel Astakhov Lawyers Board".&lt;ref name=rp/&gt; Astakhov represented some of Russia’s most high-profile public figures, including Moscow Mayor [[Yury Luzhkov]], the descendants of the [[House of Romanov#Contemporary Romanovs|Romanov dynasty]], several Russian [[pop-star]]s and others.&lt;ref name=rp/&gt;

===Edmond Pope===
The first case which gave prominence to Pavel Astakhov was that of [[Edmond Pope]]. On 5 April 2000, Pope, a retired US [[Office of Naval Intelligence|naval intelligence]] officer, was arrested in Moscow by the Russian [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Federal Security Service]] (FSB) after making contact with a Russian torpedo scientist. Pope was charged with espionage, seeking plans for the high-speed underwater [[VA-111 Shkval]] missile.

Edmond Pope was only the second American in 40 years to stand trial for espionage in Moscow. The first, [[Francis Gary Powers]], the pilot of a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane that was shot down in 1960, was exchanged for a convicted Soviet spy, [[Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher|Rudolf Abel]].

In December 2000, Astakhov surprised the court hearing the case by delivering his closing arguments in verse.&lt;ref name=pope/&gt; He read out a 12-page lyric he had composed in [[iambic pentameter]]s, urging the court to acquit Pope.&lt;ref name=pope&gt;{{cite news |title=US 'spy' defended in verse |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1050566.stm |newspaper=[[BBC World Service]] |date=1 December 2000 |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court was not impressed by Astakhov's poetry skills and Pope received a 20-year jail sentence; he was later pardoned by Vladimir Putin and was flown back to US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=American Jailed as Spy in Moscow Is Freed on Putin's Orders; U.S. Welcomes Gesture |first=Sabrina |last=Tavernise |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/15/world/american-jailed-as-spy-in-moscow-is-freed-on-putin-s-orders-us-welcomes-gesture.html?pagewanted=print&amp;src=pm |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=15 December 2000 |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vladimir Gusinsky===

In 2000-2001 Pavel Astakhov helped Russian media tycoon [[Vladimir Gusinsky]] to escape two fraud charges.

On 13 June 2000, Gusinsky was arrested on charges of stealing property worth more than $10 million from the state-owned "Russian Video" company, but three days later, after a petition by Astakhov, Gusinsky was released on bail. Later, Astakhov and another prominent lawyer, [[Henri Reznik]], managed to halt the criminal case against Gusinsky, who flew to Spain. Another case was opened on 17 September, alleging the embezzlement of $300 million from [[Gazprom]], and on 17 November prosecutors reopened the first case. 
Gusinsky was arrested in Spain on an international arrest warrant on 12 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Russia get Gusinsky? |author=Lannin, Patrick |author2=Hayley, Julia |url=http://www.news24.com/xArchive/Archive/Will-Russia-get-Gusinsky-20001213# |work=[[News24]] |date=14 December 2000 |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December he was released on bail of 1 billion pesetas ($5.5 million).

Pavel Astakhov and Gusinsky's defence team claimed that the charges were politically motivated, and on 24 April 2001 the Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garzon]] declined to extradite Gusinsky to Russia.

Following his role in the Pope and Gusinsky cases, Astakhov was invited to the USA to participate in a round table organized by the [[United States Congress|US Congress]]. He spent the following year in Pittsburgh completing a Master's in Law.

===Saddam Hussein===

In December 2003, Pavel Astakhov sent a letter to the US [[Embassy of the United States in Moscow|Embassy]] in Moscow, advising President [[George W. Bush]] and Ambassador [[Alexander Vershbow]] that he would like to represent [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref name=shm&gt;{{cite news |title=News in Brief: Lawyer Chases Hussein |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19782633_ITM |newspaper=[[The Moscow Times]] |date=19 December 2003 |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked by a reporter whether he was prepared to defend Saddam Hussein free of charge, Astakhov replied: "I do not think that the former president of [[Iraq]] will agree to accept free legal aid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Наташа |last=Ваульс |script-title=ru:Адвокаты дьявола |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/press/newsid_3329000/3329565.stm#2 |work=[[BBC Russian Service]] |date=18 December 2003 |accessdate=9 March 2012 |language= Russian |trans-title=Devil's Advocates }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saddam Hussein, however, did not have a chance to use Astakhov's services.

==TV personality and author==

In 2003 Astakhov became the host of ''Chas Suda'' (''Hour of Judgment'') which aired on the [[REN TV]] channel.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=rp/&gt; It was the first Russian [[judge show]]. Unlike ''[[Judge Judy]]'' in the USA, both parties in these trials are played by actors, with Astakhov acting as judge. The show became enormously popular and Astakhov set up a production company, Pravo TV, to make other programs with a legal theme.&lt;ref name=rp/&gt;

Astakhov is also a prolific author, writing about his experiences in the Moscow legal system, as well as producing a series of novels featuring lawyer protagonists.&lt;ref name=rp/&gt;

==Politician==

In the early days of Vladimir Putin, Astakhov was a trenchant critic of the Russian authorities, accusing them of political persecution of his clients, Vladimir Gusinsky and Edmond Pope. He spoke of a "total disregard for human rights" and claimed that the prosecutors "blindly execute the wishes of the authorities".&lt;ref name=anti&gt;{{cite news |script-title=ru:Адвокат Эдмонда Поупа и Владимира Гусинского стал "Почетным адвокатом России" |url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/06aug2001/astakhov_print.html |work=[[NEWSru]] |date=6 August 2001 |accessdate=7 March 2012 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Astakhov made a 180-degree turn in his political affiliation and became one of the most prominent supporters of the top leadership of Russia. In November 2007 he founded and headed the national movement ''Za Putina'' (For Putin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=United Behind a Putin Third Term |first=Natalya |last=Krainova |url=http://www.pressmon.com/cgi-bin/press_view.cgi?id=265728 |newspaper=[[Moscow Times]] |date=12 November 2007 |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the founding conference, Astakhov described the aim of the new movement as follows: "Don't we choose a master in the house? Well, here we are proposing to find a master for the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fans want Putin to stay in power |url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/printArticle.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=184968&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=39&amp;parent_id=21 |agency=[[Interfax]] |newspaper=[[Gulf Times]] |date=16 November 2007 |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's Commissioner==

On 30 December 2009 [[Dmitry Medvedev|President Medvedev]] appointed Astakhov as Children's Rights Commissioner for the President of the Russian Federation,&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; a post often referred to as [[Children's Ombudsman#Russia|children's ombudsman]].&lt;ref name=rp/&gt; At the time of his appointment, Astakhov was one of Russia's leading private lawyers, but he did not have a child welfare background.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; His predecessor and the first holder of the office, [[Alexei Golovan]], had resigned unexpectedly on 26 December, just months after his appointment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bearr.org/news_items/view/111 Bearr Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120728101316/http://www.bearr.org/news_items/view/111 |date=28 July 2012 }} report of Golovan resignation&lt;/ref&gt; (Golovan remained involved in child rights issues and was in 2012 involved in the development of legislation to protect the rights of children in orphanages.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bearr.org/en/news_items/view/622 Bearr Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120719003815/http://www.bearr.org/en/news_items/view/622 |date=19 July 2012 }} report on orphanages Bill&lt;/ref&gt;

Astakhov's critics in Russia have accused him of being an opportunist and a publicity seeker. Some child advocacy groups wished him "to pay more attention to protecting the rights of children in Russia and less to PR for himself".&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{cite news |title=Pavel Astakhov, star of courtroom and TV, is Russia's ombudsman for children |first=Philip |last=Pan |authorlink=Philip Pan |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/05/AR2010050505236.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=6 May 2010 |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010 Astakhov described [[child advocacy]] groups as the "best form of legalisation of the paedophile community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=ru:Павел Астахов: Гей-парады навязывает педофильское лобби |first=Лев |last=Сирин |url=http://www.fontanka.ru/2010/04/19/079/ |newspaper=Фонтанка.ру |date=19 April 2010 |accessdate=7 March 2012 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Adoption===
As ombudsman Astakhov sought to raise awareness of the welfare of Russian children [[Adoption|adopted]] by foreign families.&lt;ref name=rp/&gt; According to official Russian statistics, a total of 19 adopted Russian children had died worldwide as a result of beatings or negligence, since 1991.&lt;ref name=died/&gt; Some of Astakhov's critics alleged that he paid too much attention to the abuse cases after [[international adoption]]s and not enough to child abuse cases in Russia itself, where some 2,000 children were killed every year as a result of domestic child abuse.&lt;ref name=died&gt;{{cite news |title=Russian ombudsman slams US acquittal in Russian child death |url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20111202/169243111.html |agency=[[RIA Novosti]] |date=2 December 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Medvedev told Astakhov in December 2011: "I think that we cannot make any distinction here between cases abroad and cases at home. These are all crimes, serious crimes."&lt;ref name=president&gt;{{cite web |title=Working meeting with Pavel Astakhov and Yury Chaika |url=http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/3160 |work=Official website of the [[President of Russia]] |date=3 December 2011 |accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astakhov was deeply involved in the preparation of the Russian-US treaty on adoption, signed by the [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] and the [[Sergey Lavrov|Foreign Minister of Russia]] on 13 July 2011.&lt;ref name=treaty/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2011/07/168478.htm |title=Remarks With Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov After their Meeting |date=13 July 2011 |work=Official website of the [[United States Department of State|US Department of State]] |accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This treaty bans the independent adoption of Russian children, leaving adoption through agencies as the only option.&lt;ref name=treaty&gt;{{cite news |script-title=ru:Усыновление скрепили договором |author=Берсенева, Анастасия |author2=Карелин, Дмитрий |url=http://www.gazeta.ru/social/2011/07/13/3694881.shtml |newspaper=[[Gazeta.ru]] |date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2012 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; American citizens who wish to adopt a child from Russia through an agency must pay $40–50 thousand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theadoptionguide.com/options/adoption-from-russia |title=Adoption from Russia |work=The Adoption Guide |publisher=Adoptive Families magazine |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas for Russian citizens the procedures are completely free of charge. Moreover, adoptive parents in many Russian regions receive financial aid from the regional authorities, which sometimes amount to RUR 300 thousand (about $10 thousand) per child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usynovite.ru/massmedia/6e7aa78b8e.html |script-title=ru:Приемные семьи Кубани получат по 300 тысяч рублей |work=Усыновление в России |publisher=[[Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation]] |accessdate=7 March 2012 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Medvedev told Pavel Astakhov on 3 December 2011: "There is nothing wrong with foreign adoptions of our children... the fact that foreign citizens do it does not tarnish them in any way, and on the contrary shows their desire to help these children."&lt;ref name=president/&gt; However, two weeks later, at [[Vladimir Putin]]'s annual question and answer session with the public, broadcast live across Russia, Astakhov declared himself "an absolute opponent of international adoption"&lt;ref name=ast/&gt; and asked Putin to change the law and to ban all international adoptions in Russia.&lt;ref name=ast&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moskva-putinu.ru/ |script-title=ru:Разговор с Владимиром Путиным. Продолжение |publisher=[[All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company]] |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2012 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We must, as much as possible, keep our children in our country," Astakhov said in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Quotes of the Day |url=http://www.time.com/time/quotes/0,26174,1982523,00.html |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=16 April 2010 |accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012 Astakhov suggested that Russian citizens should apply to adopt [[United States|US]] children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=ru:Астахов призвал россиян принципиально усыновлять американских детей |url=http://vz.ru/news/2012/4/16/574696.html |work=Взгляд |date=16 April 2012 |accessdate=21 April 2012 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there were still 665,987 orphans in Russia itself according to the latest statistics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usynovite.ru/statistics/2010/2/ |script-title=ru:Устройство детей, оставшихся без попечения родителей, в 2010 году |work=Усыновление в России |publisher=[[Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)|Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation]] |accessdate=21 April 2012 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the number of adoptions in Russia had been falling each year since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usynovite.ru/statistics/2010/3/ |script-title=ru:Динамика устройства детей в семьи |work=Усыновление в России |publisher=[[Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)|Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation]] |accessdate=21 April 2012 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012 Astakhov announced that in the next 5–8 years most of Russian [[orphanage]]s and [[boarding school]]s would be shut down, and their residents adopted by Russian [[Foster care|foster]] families.&lt;ref name=orphanages/&gt; He said that more state funds "should be allocated to foster families" to "give a fresh impetus to foster parents to adopt a child... Russia without Orphans slogan should become one of the top priorities for the government and public servants".&lt;ref name=orphanages&gt;{{cite news |title=Most orphanages to be closed in Russia, children to be adopted |url=http://www.itar-tass.com/en/c154/353743.html |agency=[[Information Telegraph Agency of Russia|ITAR-TASS News Agency]] |date=28 February 2012 |accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts, however, pointed out that Astakhov's reliance on financial incentives had led to an increasing number of children being returned to orphanages.&lt;ref name=bum/&gt; According to the report of the chairwoman of the [[State Duma|Russian parliamentary]] committee on family and children [[Yelena Mizulina]] in April 2010, thousands of children had been taken in by foster parents for financial reasons, and subsequently rejected after the financial assistance had been paid.&lt;ref name=bum&gt;{{cite news |script-title=ru:В России начался "бум возврата" приемных детей |url=http://www.deti.rian.ru/usynovlenie/20100423/200018500.html |agency=[[RIA Novosti]] |date=23 April 2010 |accessdate=21 April 2012 |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213201/http://www.deti.rian.ru/usynovlenie/20100423/200018500.html |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yelena Mizulina|Mizulina]] said that 30,000 children had been sent back to institutions by their Russian adoptive, foster or [[Legal guardian|guardianship]] families in the last three years: "Specialists call such a boom in returns a humanitarian catastrophe".&lt;ref name=bum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=International adoption: Everyone wants the best for children |url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20100430/158820438.html |agency=[[RIA Novosti]] |date=30 April 2010 |accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mizulina&gt;{{cite news |first=Clifford J. |last=Levy |authorlink=Clifford J.

Despite the grave Russian domestic statistics of [[Disruption (adoption)|disruption]] of adoptions, Pavel Astakhov drew media attention to the case of a 7-year-old, Artem Saveliev (Justin Hansen), who was adopted in 2009 by the Tennessee nurse Torry Hansen, but in April 2010 was sent back to Russia with a note saying that he was "mentally unstable".&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first=Clifford J. |last=Levy |authorlink=Clifford J.

===Child Marriage===
In 2015, Astakhov defended the marriage of a 47-year-old police chief to 17-year-old [[Luiza "Kheda" Goilabiyeva]] in [[Chechnya]]. There were widespread reports that Goilabiyeva had been threatened with kidnap and violence if she did not agree to marry Nazhud Guchigov,&lt;ref name=sydney&gt;{{cite news |title=Ally of Chechen strongman marries teen| url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/ally-of-chechen-strongman-marries-teen-20150517-gh3s74.html | newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=18 May 2015 |accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=novaya&gt;{{cite news |title=В Чечне начальник РОВД женился на 17-летней Луизе Гойлабиевой |url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/1693839.html |newspaper=Novaya Gazeta |date=16 May 2015 |accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; though she later gave an interview with LifeNews where she stated that she had married Guchigov of her own free will.&lt;ref name=Life&gt;{{cite news |title=Луиза Гойлабиева рассказала LifeNews о предстоящей свадьбе |url=http://lifenews.ru/news/153777 |date=12 May 2015 |accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the marriage contravened Russian laws on polygamy and the legal age of adulthood, Astakhov defended the marriage, saying that "sexual maturity happens earlier [in the Caucasus]" and "there are places where women are already shriveled at age 27, and by our standards they look like they're 50."&lt;ref name=rferl&gt;{{cite news |title=Russian official stirs scandal with underage marriage and 'shriveled' women remarks |first=Carl |last=Schreck |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-underage-marriage-shriveled-women/27017059.html |date=14 May 2015 |accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His comments prompted many women to post photographs of their wrinkles under the hashtag #сморщеннаяженщина (#wrinkledwoman).&lt;ref name=wrinkledwomen&gt;{{cite news |title=#WrinkledWomen |last=O'Flynn |first=Elaine |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3086888/WrinkledWomen-Outraged-Chechen-females-use-Instagram-attack-official-defended-forced-marriage-girl-17-47-year-old-police-chief-claiming-women-country-shrivelled-age-27.html |date=19 May 2015 |accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the issue has since become child marriage,&lt;ref name=meduza&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia’s ‘wedding of the century’ The country’s rage about a 17-year-old girl marrying a 47-year-old Chechen police chief |url=https://meduza.io/en/feature/2015/05/18/russia-s-wedding-of-the-century |date=18 May 2015 |accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Astakhov asserting that "you should not be worried about early marriages … but about the early sex life of teenagers. The two need to be kept separate. Romeo and Juliet dreamed of getting married, not of intimate relations."&lt;ref name=shrivelled&gt;{{cite news |title=Russian official causes outrage with 'shrivelled women' remarks |last=Walker |first=Shaun |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/15/russian-official-shrivelled-women-marriage |date=15 May 2015 |accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pillarisation''' ({{lang-nl|verzuiling}}) is the politico-denominational [[Religious segregation|segregation]] of a society. These societies were (and in some areas, still are) "vertically" divided into several segments or "pillars" (''zuilen'', singular ''zuil'') according to different religions or ideologies. The best-known examples of this have historically occurred in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]].

These pillars all have their own [[Social organisation|social institutions]]: their own newspapers, [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting|broadcasting organisations]], [[political parties]], trade unions and farmers' associations, banks, schools, hospitals, universities, [[Scouting]] organisations and sports clubs. Some companies even hire only personnel of a specific religion or ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/employ/gibson2.htm|title=CAIN: Issues - Discrimination: 'Discrimination and Employment' from Perspectives on Discrimination and Social Work in Northern Ireland|last=Melaugh|first=Dr Martin|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a situation where many people have no personal contact with people from another pillar.

==Netherlands==
{{Life in the Netherlands|Policies}}
The Netherlands had (at least) three pillars: [[Protestant]], [[Catholic]] and [[Social Democracy|Social-democratic]]. Pillarisation was originally initiated by [[Abraham Kuyper]] and his [[Christian Democratic]] and [[Neo-Calvinism|neo-Calvinist]] (''[[Reformed Churches in the Netherlands|gereformeerd]]'') [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP) in the late 1800s; it was part of their philosophy of [[sphere sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;John Halsey Wood Jr., ''Going Dutch in the Modern Age: Abraham Kuyper's Struggle for a Free Church in the Netherlands'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2014|reason=Dubious statement, not in source given.}}

The Catholic pillar had the highest degree of organisation, because Catholic clergy promoted the organisation of almost the whole life of Catholics in confessional institutions. Yet, the conservative Protestant pillar and the Socialist pillar, which mainly consisted of [[industrial workers]], were nearly as tightly knit.&lt;ref name="Vanzanden"&gt;{{Citation |first=Jan L. |last=Van Zanden |title=The Economic History of the Netherlands 1914-1995: A small open economy in the 'long' twentieth century |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Protestant (''[[Dutch Reformed Church|hervormd]]'') [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU) (formed in 1908) did not organise a pillar of its own but linked itself to the Protestant pillar shaped by the ARP.

People who were not associated with one of these pillars, mainly [[middle class|middle-]] and [[upper class|upper-class]] [[latitudinarian]] Protestants and atheists, arguably set up their own pillar: the liberal or "general" pillar. Ties between general organisations were much weaker than within the other three pillars. Liberals actually rejected the voluntary segregation of the society, and denied the existence of a "liberal pillar".&lt;ref name="Vanzanden"/&gt; The political parties usually associated with this group were the [[Free-minded Democratic League]] (VDB) and [[Liberal State Party]] (LSP). [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|Communists]], [[Humanism|Humanists]] and ultra-orthodox Protestants also set up similar organisations; however, such groups were much smaller.

The development of pillarisation in the Netherlands was favoured by the emancipation of working and lower-middle classes on the one hand, and the execution of elite control on the other hand. The emancipation of the working class led to the establishment of socialist parties, trade unions, media, cooperative shops and collectively organised leisure activities. This "full care" of the socialist movement for its members existed similarly in other European countries. The emancipation of the conservative and often strongly religious lower-middle class fostered the emergence of the Protestant pillar. While the Dutch bourgeoisie was rather liberal and adhered to "enlightened" Protestantism, a large part of the lower-middle class embraced a more orthodox Calvinist theology taught by preacher and politician [[Abraham Kuyper]].&lt;ref name="Vanzanden"/&gt;

In 1866 Kuyper founded the ''gereformeerd'' ("reformed") current of Protestantism that was both more conservative and more popular with ordinary people than the established Protestant churches in the Netherlands. Kuyper's worldview asserted the principle of "sphere sovereignty", rejecting both ecclesiasticism (rule of the Church over all parts of the society) and statist secularism (rule of the state over all parts of the society). Instead he argued that both had their own spheres in which the other was not to interfere. In 1879 he founded the Anti-Revolutionary Party as the political wing of his religious movement and core of the Protestant pillar.

At the same time, new and old elites tried to maintain their control over the newly emancipated social groups. For instance, the Catholic clergy set up confessional unions to prevent Catholic workers from joining socialist unions. One reason behind the formation of Christian parties was to counter the feared rise of left-wing mass parties.&lt;ref name="Vanzanden"/&gt;

===Depillarisation===
After [[World War II]] (during which even the [[Dutch resistance]] was pillarised) liberals and socialists, but also Protestants and Catholics, began to doubt the pillarised system. They founded a unity movement, the People's Movement ''[[Nederlandse Volksbeweging]]''. Progressives of all pillars (including the Catholic resistance movement ''[[Christofoor]]'') were united in the aim to renew the political system (''[[doorbraak]]'', "breakthrough"). But pillarisation was ingrained in Dutch society, and could not be defeated that easily. In order to force this breakthrough, the socialist [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]], the left-liberal [[Vrijzinnig Democratische Bond|VDB]] and the Christian-socialist [[Christian Democratic Union (Netherlands)|CDU]] united to form the [[Dutch Labour Party|PvdA]], a progressive party, which was open to all people. The new party did not, however, gain enough support under Catholics or Reformed and the PvdA became encapsulated in the socialist pillar.

Television broadcasting was also pillarised, but everyone watched the same broadcasts nonetheless, since initially only one channel was available in the Netherlands (during the 1950s). During the 1960s the pillars largely broke down, particularly under political criticism from [[Democrats 66|D66]] and the group ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Nieuw Links|nl|3=Nieuw Links (PvdA)}}'' (New Left) in PvdA. Because of this and of increased mobility, many people could see that people from the other pillars were not that different from themselves. Increased wealth and education made people independent of many of the pillarised [[institutions]], and young people did not want to be associated with these organisations anymore.

In 1973, two main Protestant parties, ARP and CHU, merged with the Catholic KVP to form the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA). They first participated in the [[Dutch general election, 1977|1977 general elections]]. In 1976, the Catholic trade union {{Interlanguage link multi|Nederlands Katholiek Vakverbond|nl}} (NKV) started to cooperate with the trade union of the Socialist pillar (NVV), to merge into the [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging]] (FNV) in 1982.

The pillarisation of society has not fully disappeared, and many remnants can still be seen in the 21st century: [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting|public television]], for instance, is still divided in several organisations, instead of being one organisation. The Netherlands has both public and [[special school (Netherlands)|religious schools]], a divide which is also inherited from pillarisation. Moreover, some communities continue to behave as small "pillars" {{as of | 2014 | lc = on}}, although rather than forming the structure of society (a pillar), this currently moves them outside the mainstream of society. Members of the [[Reformed Churches (Liberated)|Reformed Churches (liberated)]] have their own (primary and secondary) schools, their own national newspaper, and some other organisations, such as a labour union. Members of several [[pietist]] Reformed Churches have also founded their own schools, newspaper and political party. Increasingly, [[Islam in the Netherlands|Muslim immigrants in the Netherlands]] are also using the legal possibilities created for the pillarised structure of society, by setting up their own schools.

==Belgium==
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2013}}
Apart from having no Protestant pillar, Pillarisation in Belgium was very similar to that in Netherlands. There was also no "general" pillar, but a politically well-organised liberal pillar. In 1911, the British sociologist [[Seebohm Rowntree]] noted that in Belgium:

{{quote|There is extraordinarily little social intercourse between Catholics and Liberals, and practically none between Catholics and Socialists. Politics enter into almost every phase of social activity and philanthropic effort, and it is the exception rather than the rule for persons holding different political opinions to co-operate in any other matter. Thus in one town there will be a Catholic, a Liberal and a Socialist trade union, a Catholic, a Liberal and a Socialist thrift society, each catering for similar people, but each confining its attentions to members of its own political party. The separation extends to cafes, gymnasia, choral, temperance, and literary societies; indeed it cuts through life!&lt;ref&gt;[[Seebohm Rowntree]]'s ''Land and Labour, Lessons from Belgium'' (1911), quoted in {{cite journal|last=Cliff|first=Tony|authorlink=Tony Cliff|title=Belgium: Strike to Revolution?|journal=International Socialism|date=Spring 1961|volume=1|issue=4|pages=10–7|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1961/xx/belgium.htm|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In both [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]], societies are pillarised. In Flanders, Catholics were the dominant pillar, while the Socialists dominated in Wallonia. Even though the liberals are stronger in Belgium (particularly in [[Brussels]]) than in the Netherlands, they are still relatively weak, owing to their rather small, bourgeois support: liberal trade unions are very small. ''[[De Tijd]]'', a financial daily, is the newspaper aligned with the liberals, as its readership consists mainly of liberal supporters. However, a Flemish newspaper with historical liberal roots, ''[[Het Laatste Nieuws]]'', also exists.

Denominational (many Catholic and a few Jewish) schools receive some public money, although not parity of funding as in the Netherlands, so that tuition is almost completely free. Belgian universities charge more or less the same, relatively low, tuition fees.

As a consequence of the [[language struggle]] in the latter half of the twentieth century, the pillars split over the language issue, which turnout became the most significant divisive factor in the nation. Now every language group has three pillars of its own. The pillar system remained to be the primordial societal dividing force much longer than it was in the Netherlands. Only near the end of the [[Cold War]] did it begin to lose importance, at least at the individual level, and to this day it continues to influence Belgian society. For example, even the 1999–2003 "[[Belgium#Government and politics|Rainbow Coalition]]" of [[Guy Verhofstadt]] was often rendered with the terms of pillarisation. Political currents, which rose in late 20th century ([[Vlaams Blok]], now [[Vlaams Belang]], [[Groen!]], [[N-VA]] ), did not attempt to build pillars.

Pillarisation was visible even in everyday social organisations such as musical ensembles, sport clubs, recreational facilities, etc. Weakened in the current situation, many major social organisations (trade unions, cooperatives, etc.) still strictly follow the lines of pillars though.

==''Proporz'' in Austria==
{{Main article|Proporz}}
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2013}}
The Austrian version of Verzuiling is the long-standing ''Proporz'' doctrine (a [[hypocorism]] for ''Proportionalität'', [[German language|German]] for 'proportionality'). This was first only within the politics of the [[second Austrian republic]], but later degenerated into a neo-corporatist system of patronage and nepotism pervading many aspects of [[Austria]]n life. The ''Proporz'' was created, developed and promoted by the two mainstream parties, the [[Catholic]] [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP) and the [[Social-Democratic]] [[Socialist Party of Austria]] (since 1991 [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]], both names with the acronym of SPÖ).

This ''de facto'' two-party system collapsed with the [[Austrian legislative election, 1999|elections of 1999]], which resulted in the joining of the [[national-conservative]] [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FPÖ), whose political marginalisation and that of its predecessor, the [[Federation of Independents]] (VdU), was the main reason for the establishment of the ''Proporz'' policy, because of their [[Anschluss|pro-German]] and [[individualist]] views.

The Proporz system arose out of the need for balanced, consensual governance in the early years of Austria's second republic. At that time, the country was consumed in an effort to rebuild the country after the devastation of World War II. Thus, the doctrine of Proporz is intimately linked to the idea of the grand coalition, in which the major political parties, in the case of post-war Austria the SPÖ and the ÖVP, share in the government.

'''Pixley ka Isaka Seme''' (c. 1881&lt;ref&gt;The birthdate is Seme's personal estimate at the time of his application to Mount Hermon.&lt;/ref&gt; – June 1951) was one of the first black lawyers in [[South Africa]] (Alfred Mangena was the first black attorney, Duma Nokwe the first black advocate), and a founder and [[President (corporate title)|President]] of the [[African National Congress]].

==Early life==
Seme was born the fourth son of Sinono Kuwana Seme in the area that would come to be known as [[Daggakraal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pixley Ka Seme stature unveiled|url=http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/046a09804ab76f4aa718efa0088ad6ed/Pixley-Ka-Seme-stature-unveiled-20123103|publisher=SABC News.com|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Struggle-hero-honoured-20040112|title=Struggle hero honoured|last=Samayende|first=Sizwe|date=2004-01-12|work=News24|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in what was then called the [[Colony of Natal]], at the Inanda mission station of the American Zulu Mission of the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]]. He graduated from Mount Hermon School, MA, in 1902 (now the [[Northfield Mount Hermon School]]). He attended [[Adams College]] which was part of the mission.

His mother was a sister of [[John Langalibalele Dube]], and descended from a local chief.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith 1952)&lt;/ref&gt;  At 17 years of age Seme left to study in the U.S., first at the [[Northfield Mount Hermon School|Mount Hermon School]] and then [[Columbia University]]. In 1906, his senior year at University, he was awarded the Curtis Medal, Columbia's highest [[Public speaking|oratorical]] honor.  He subsequently decided to become an [[Lawyer|attorney]]. In October 1906 he was admitted to [[Oxford University]] to read for the degree of [[Bachelor of Civil Law]]; while at Oxford he was a member of [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]]. He was admitted to the [[Middle Temple]] on 12 February 1907 and was Called to the Bar on 8 June 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Sturgess, H.A.C. (1949). ''Middle Temple Admission Register Vol. 2, 1782-1909''. Butterworth &amp; Co. (Publishers) Ltd.: London. p.762&lt;/ref&gt;

Seme returned to South Africa in 1910, and began to practice as a lawyer in [[Johannesburg]].

== Politics ==
In 1911, Seme established the [[South African Native Farmers Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/046a09804ab76f4aa718efa0088ad6ed/PixleyundefinedKaundefinedSemeundefinedstatureundefinedunveiled-20123103|title=Pixley Ka Seme stature unveiled|last=|first=|date=2012-03-31|work=South African Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=2017-05-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820011640/http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/046a09804ab76f4aa718efa0088ad6ed/PixleyundefinedKaundefinedSemeundefinedstatureundefinedunveiled-20123103|archive-date=2017-08-20|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to encourage black farm workers to buy land in the Daggakraal area, and thus attain personal independence. Consequently, this led the white government to enact the [[Natives Land Act, 1913|Natives Land Act]] of 1913, barring black people from owning land in South Africa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/Archives/City-Press/Going-home-20-years-later-Everythingand-nothingchanges-20150430|title=Going home 20 years later: Everything–and nothing–changes|last=Yende|first=Sizwe Sama|date=2014-06-05|work=News24|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the formation of the Union of South Africa, Seme worked with several other young African leaders recently returned from university studies in England, [[Richard Msimang]], [[George Montsioa]] and [[Alfred Mangena]], and with established leaders of the South African Native Convention in Johannesburg to promote the formation of a national organization that would unify various African groups from the separate colonies. In January 1912, these efforts bore fruit with the founding meeting of the South African Native National Congress, later renamed the African National Congress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Protest Politics in South Africa to 1912|last=Odendaal|first=Andre|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books.|year=1984|isbn=|location=Totowa, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rise of African Nationalism in South Africa: The African National Congress, 1912-1952|last=Walshe|first=Peter|publisher=University of California Press.|year=1970|isbn=|location=Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seme was also the lawyer of Queen Regent [[Labotsibeni Mdluli|Labotsibeni]] of [[Swaziland]], through whom the first ANC newspaper ''[[Abantu-Batho]]'' was financed. Later, in 1922, Seme accompanied King [[Sobhuza II]] as part of a delegation to [[London]] to meet British authorities and the King regarding the land proclamation in Swaziland.

Seme's nationalist organizing among Africans paralleled the contemporaneous efforts of [[Mohandas Gandhi]] with [[Indian South Africans|South African Indians]].

== Personal life ==
Seme was very close to the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] and [[Swazi people|Swazi]] royal families. This is primarily symbolized by his marriage to Phikisele Harriet Dinizulu, the daughter of Zulu king [[Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo | Dinuzulu]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and to Lozinja, daughter of Swazi King [[Mbandzeni]].

'''Progress Publishers''' was a [[Moscow]]-based [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[publisher]] founded in 1931.

It was noted for its English-language editions of books on [[Marxism–Leninism]].

Progress Publishers were particularly also known for their "Short History of USSR" and ABC series (''ABC of Party'', ''ABC of Socialism'', ''ABC of Dialectical Materialism'', etc.). They also published many scientific books, books on arts, political books, [[classic books]], [[children's literature]], novels and short fiction, books in source languages for people studying foreign languages, [[guidebook]]s and [[photographic album]]s.  They also published, in 1979, ''[[Marx and Engels on the United States]]'', a compilation drawn from letters, articles, and various other works.

One of the common features of all Progress books was their "request to reader" to send an opinion and suggestions on the book. It reads:

{{quote|REQUEST TO READERS. Progress Publishers would be glad to have your opinion of this book, its translation and design and any suggestions you may have for future publications. Please send all your comments to 21, Zubovsky Boulevard, Moscow, U.S.S.R.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Polevoi |first=Boris |title=A Story About a Real Man |year=1967 |publisher=Progress Publishers |location=Moscow }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13594">[[File:Peron-NacionalizacionFA.jpg|thumb|250px|President [[Juan Perón]] (''right'') signs the nationalization of the British-owned railways with Ambassador Sir [[Reginald Leeper]], March, 1948.]]

In 1948, during President [[Juan Perón]]'s first term of office, the seven [[Great Britain|British]]-owned and three [[France|French]]-owned railway companies then operating in [[Argentina]], were purchased by the [[Government of Argentina|state]]. These companies, together with those that were already state-owned, where grouped, according to their track gauge and locality, into a total of six state-owned companies which later became divisions of the state-owned holding company [[Ferrocarriles Argentinos]].

==Background==
In the latter half of the 19th century British and French-owned railway companies had played an important role in the [[Economic history of Argentina|economic development of Argentina]]. Between 1856 and 1914 the nation's railway network grew to become the largest in Latin America. The foreign investment provided by these companies had helped to transform Argentina from a relatively underdeveloped, rural country, with many isolated communities, into one which was becoming an increasingly prosperous agricultural producer and exporter.

The foreign-owned railway companies had developed under the protection of the Argentine's strong property rights of the time.

The rail networks of the various companies generally radiated inland from the major ports of [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Rosario]] and were primarily designed to speed the export of agricultural products from the provinces to European markets. The lack of interlinking between the many radial lines meant that the integration of the country’s interior was probably slower than it would have been had domestic needs been a priority.

During [[World War II]] it had not been possible to import railway equipment or materials which meant that there was an urgent need for track, locomotive and rolling stock renewal by the time nationalisation took place in 1948. Also railways were beginning to face stiff competition from road transport as improvements in the national road network were made.

By the time the railways were nationalised in 1948, during President Perón's first term in office, the growth in economic nationalism in the country had reached a point where, for many Argentines in search of self-determination, the foreign-owned railways had become symbols of the control of the country's economy by foreign powers.

==  Details  ==
Between 1936 and 1939 the once British-owned [[metre gauge]] [[Córdoba Central Railway|Córdoba Central]], [[Transandine Railway|Transandine]] and [[Central Chubut Railway|Central Chubut]] had already been nationalised. As from 1 March 1948 the remaining British-owned railway companies in Argentina also became the property of the government. These were the four [[broad gauge]] companies: [[Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway|BA Great Southern]], [[Central Argentine Railway|Central Argentine]], [[Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway|BA &amp; Pacific]] and the [[Buenos Aires Western Railway|BA Western]]; the [[standard gauge]] companies [[Entre Ríos Railway|Entre Ríos]] and [[Argentine North Eastern Railway|Argentine North Eastern]]; and the [[Buenos Aires Midland Railway]] the only [[metre gauge]] company.

The official transfer of ownership, on March 1, of some 24,458&amp;nbsp;km of British-owned railways (57% of the total railway network) to the Argentine government took place amidst widespread celebrations including a mass demonstration in its support on [[Buenos Aires]]' [[Torre de los Ingleses|Plaza Británica]], in front of the [[Retiro railway station|Retiro railway terminus]].

British shareholders were compensated with the rescision of their [[US Dollar|US$]] 500 million debt to the [[Central Bank of Argentina]] and US$100 million, cash. The cash figure proved controversial, as it had not previously been reported during the negotiations.  Pressed on the issue, President Perón explained that the premium was for "sentimental reasons."&lt;ref&gt;''A House Divided: Argentina, 1880-1980'' by Crawley, Eduardo - London: St. Martin's Press (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1948 the three French-owned railway companies were also nationalised: the broad gauge [[Rosario and Puerto Belgrano Railway|Rosario &amp; Puerto Belgrano]] and the metre gauge [[Ferrocarril Compañía General en la Provincia de Buenos Aires|Compañía General de Buenos Aires]] and [[Ferrocarril Provincial de Santa Fe|Provincial de Santa Fe]].

After the nationalisation all the Argentine network was grouped into six railway divisions named after distinguished Argentine presidents and national heroes (such as [[José de San Martín]], [[Manuel Belgrano]], [[Domingo Sarmiento]], [[Justo José de Urquiza]], [[Bartolomé Mitre]] and [[Julio Argentino Roca|Julio A. Roca]]) according to their [[track gauge]] and locality. Apart from former British and French companies, Argentine ones also became part of "Ferrocarriles Argentinos", the state-owned company specifically created after the nationalisation to manage the entire railway network.

The list of companies taken over by each division was as follows:

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Peroncumple.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A 1948 propaganda poster celebrating nationalisation. Caption reads "Perón Fulfils. They are now ours!".]]

Argentines saw railway nationalisation as a major step towards the economic independence of their country which had for so long been under the influence of foreign capital. Nationalisation of the railways, the central bank, the [[ENTel|telephone system]] and the docks were part of Perón's  economic recovery scheme for postwar Argentina and had formed part of the first Five-Year Plan, announced in October 1946. Later in mass rallies he would refer to railway nationalisation as a victory over foreign imperialism.  At the time there was little local opposition, although later it became apparent that, far from stimulating the national economy, nationalisation of the railways together with other foreign companies, contributed to the economic crises that Argentina suffered from the 1950s onwards by adding substantially to national budget deficits (which the Central Bank was forced to finance largely by "[[Money creation|printing money]]", leading to inflation). Argentine Railways, in particular, became the most deficit ridden [[State enterprise]] among the numerous ones nationalized by Perón, generating a million US dollars in losses daily by the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Argentina''. Scarecrow Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; and two million by the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;''Clarín''. February 12, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''recruitment tool''' is an advertising method that aids in creating interest in and getting people for a typically political organization.  Historically recruitment tools have often taken the form of posters or films, though in modern times recruitment tools have taken the form of [[advergame]] [[video games]]. Other tools include things like sponsorships of sporting events, or ads on TV.

==Film==
The following is a list of examples of [[propaganda film]] recruitment tools and the political organizations which they intend to recruit for.
*''Alice's Egg Plant'' – promotes an anti-[[trade union|union]] philosophy
*''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' – recruits for the [[Communist Party]] of the [[U.S.S.R.]]
*''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' – recruits for the [[Ku Klux Klan]]
*''[[The Bond]]'' – recruits for the Liberty Load Committee of the [[U.S. Government]]

==Biography==
Born of Jewish parents, Hauser was the elder of two daughters of Nathan and Frieda (Litt) Abrams, Rita Eleanor (Abrams).

In 1954 she received a [[B.A.]] from [[Hunter College]] in New York, after which she was awarded a [[Fulbright scholarship]] for graduate work in France, which eventually resulted in receiving a [[doctorate]] in [[political economy]] from the [[University of Strasbourg]].&lt;ref name="jwa-enc"/&gt;  She attended [[Harvard Law School]] for a while, then received a [[License en droit]] from the [[University of Paris]] (a rarity for an American) in 1958, then later received an [[LL.B.]] in 1959 from the [[New York University School of Law]].&lt;ref name="jwa-enc"/&gt;

Hauser served as cochair of "New Yorkers for Nixon" during [[Richard Nixon]]’s successful 1968 presidential campaign. She then became the United States representative to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] (1969–1972). She also served as a member of the United States delegation to the twenty-fourth UN General Assembly.

During her time at the UN that she met many key players in Middle East politics and became committed to her pursuit of conflict resolution in the Middle East, human rights and humanitarian law. During her term at the UN, she helped Jewish immigrants leave Russia and visited Palestinian refugee camps throughout the Middle East.

During this period she also met [[Golda Meir]] who soon became her mentor and role model. Meir inspired Hauser’s involvement in Middle East politics and encouraged her, a secular Jew, to learn more about Jewish history and her own Jewishness.

For more than twenty years, Hauser was a Senior Partner at [[Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan]] in New York.&lt;ref name="wh-rh"/&gt;

Hauser chairs the [[International Peace Institute]] and is Chair of the Advisory Board of the [[International Crisis Group]], was elected in 2007 to the Board of the [[Global Humanitarian Forum]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], chairs the [[American Ditchley Foundation]], has served as a director of the [[RAND Corporation]] and the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]], and  is currently a Director of [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] after having been a Director of the [[New York Philharmonic Society]] for more than 20 years.&lt;ref name="wh-rh"/&gt; She also serves as an Advisory Board member for the [[Partnership for a Secure America]].

She and her husband established the [[Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations]] at [[Harvard Kennedy School of Government]], and she is Co-Chair of the Dean’s Advisory Board at [[Harvard Law School]], and the Hausers also were the principal benefactors of the Hauser Global Law School Program at [[New York University School of Law]].&lt;ref name="wh-rh"/&gt;

The '''Salary Grab Act''' was passed by the [[United States Congress]] on March 3, 1873. The effect of the Act was, the day before the inauguration of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] for a second term, to double the salary of the President (to $50,000) and the salaries of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[United States Supreme Court Justice|Justices]].

[[File:Small Office with Hewlett-Packard printers.jpg|thumb]]
'''Small office/home office''' (or '''single office/home office'''; '''SOHO''') refers to the category of business or [[cottage industry]] that involves from 1 to 10 workers. 
In New Zealand, the [[Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment]] (MBIE) defines a small office as 6 to 19 employees and a micro office as 1-5.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/business/business-growth-agenda/pdf-and-image-library/2014/The%20Small%20Business%20Sector%20Report%202014%20-PDF%208.8%20MB-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the 19th century, and the spread of the [[industrial revolution]] around the globe, nearly all offices were small offices and/or home offices, with only a few exceptions. Most businesses were small, and the paperwork that accompanied them was limited. The industrial revolution aggregated workers in factories, to mass-produce goods. In most circumstances, the [[white-collar worker|white collar]] counterpart—office work—was aggregated as well in large buildings, usually in cities or densely populated suburban areas.

Beginning in the mid-1980s, the advent of the [[personal computer]] and [[fax machine]], plus breakthroughs in [[telecommunications]], created opportunities for office workers to decentralize. Decentralization was also perceived as benefiting employers in terms of lower overheads and potentially greater productivity.

==Professions==
Many [[consultant]]s and the members of such [[profession]]s as [[lawyer]]s, real estate agents, and [[surveyor (surveying)|surveyors]] in small and medium-size towns operate from home offices.

Several ranges of products, such as the [[armoire desk]] and [[all-in-one printer]], are designed specifically for the SOHO market. A number of books and [[Family Computing|magazines]] have been published and marketed specifically at this type of office. These range from general advice texts to specific guidebooks on such challenges as setting up a small [[Private branch exchange|PBX]] for the office [[telephone]]s.

Technology has also created a demand for [[homesourcing|larger businesses to employ individuals who work from home]]. Sometimes these people remain as independent businesspersons, and sometimes they become employees of a larger company.

The small office home office has undergone a transformation since its advent as the [[internet]] has enabled anyone working from a home office to compete globally. Technology has made this possible through [[email]], the [[World Wide Web|World-Wide Web]], [[e-commerce]], [[videoconferencing]], [[remote desktop software]], [[webinar]] systems, and telephone connections by [[VOIP]]. Due to the increase in small and home offices, web services and standard business software have been created to directly assist smaller businesses in standard business practice &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=DeBaise|first=Colleen|title=Accounting 101: How to Keep Financial Records|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703399204574505840252287928 |publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/start-ups/item/24877-billfaster-raises-330k-to |title=Billfaster raises €330k to scale up online accounting globally |date=12 July 2011 |newspaper=Ireland's Technology News Service |first=Carmel |last=Doyle |accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States a home office can be claimed as a tax deduction only if office space and supplies are not provided by a corporate office.

The '''Soviet Census''' held on January 6, 1937 was the most controversial of the censuses taken within the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]. The census results were not published because the census showed much lower population figures than anticipated, although it still showed a population growth from the [[First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union|last census in 1926]], from 147 million to 162 million people in 1937.

==Delays==
After the [[First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union]] of 1926, the next census was planned to be held in 1933.&lt;ref name=Andreyev&gt;[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0271/arxiv01.php Ye.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;Andreyev, L.&amp;nbsp;Ye.&amp;nbsp;Darsky, and T.&amp;nbsp;L.&amp;nbsp;Kharkova ''On the trails of the deleted census''] Originally published in Население Советского Союза. 1922—1991. М.: Наука. 1993. с. 23—29.&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 1932 the formal commission on census organization, chaired by [[Valerian Osinsky]] was created by the Statistical Commission (Tsentral'noye Upravleniye Narodno-Khozyaystvennogo Uchyota, TsUNKhU) of [[Gosplan]]. On 22 April 1932 [[Sovnarkom]] adopted the decision ''On Conducting the all-Union Census in December 1933''. On 15 April 1933 Sovnarkom moved the date for the census to the beginning of 1935. On 23 June 1934 Sovnarkom further delayed the census to January 1936. On 15 June 1935 the census date was moved to December 1936. Finally the census was conducted on 6 January 1937.&lt;ref name=Volkov/&gt;

The multiple delays were most probably explained by the reluctance to show the catastrophic demographic results of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]] and the [[Soviet famine of 1932-1934|famine of 1932–1934]], including the [[Holodomor]].&lt;ref name=Volkov/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andreyev/&gt; The Soviet leadership had fanned great expectations of population growth.

==High expectations==
On 26 January 1934 [[Joseph Stalin]] reported to the [[17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (b)]] as one of the main achievements "Growth of population from 160.5 millions in the end of 1930 to the 168 millions in the end of 1933".&lt;ref&gt;Сталин И. В. Вопросы ленинизма. Изд. 10-е. М.: 1938. С. 572.&lt;/ref&gt;
On 1 December 1935 [[Joseph Stalin]] made a speech, on the ''Meeting of [[Kolkhoznik]]s with the Soviet and Party leaders'':&lt;ref&gt;Совещание передовых комбайнёров и комбайнёрок СССР с членами ЦК ВКП(б) и правительства 1 декабря 1935 года. М., 1935. С. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Cquote|Everybody says that the material situation of workers has dramatically improved, that life has become better and more fun. It is of course true. But this has led the population to breed much faster than in the old days. The birth rate is higher, the death rate is lower and the pure population growth is far stronger. It is of course good and we welcome it. [Jolly murmurs in the auditorium.] Now every year we have a population growth of three million souls. It means that every year we grow as much as the whole of [[Finland]]. [Everybody laughs.]}}
Combining his reports, one could have expected to have a population of about 180 million in 1937.

Official statistics based on the registered birth and death rates implied that the 1937 census should show a population of 170–172 million.&lt;ref name=Volkov/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andreyev/&gt; On 21 September 1935 [[Sovnarkom]] adopted a decision ''On the organization of registration of natural population changes'' ({{lang|ru|О постановке учёта естественного движения населения}}) most probably authored by Stalin:&lt;ref name=Volkov/&gt;
{{Cquote|The organs of registration were often used by the class enemies who had sneaked in there (priests, [[kulak]]s, [[White movement|whites]]) and made their own counterrevolutionary saboteurs work to deliberately hide population growth by registering the same deaths multiple times.}}

In fact, as discussed by A. G. Volkov,&lt;ref name=Volkov/&gt; the idea that a significant number of people received multiple death certificates for the same person is absurd. On the other hand, not registering deaths, especially those who died during the 1930s famines and prison inmates, was common. For example, during the [[Holodomor]], starving peasants tried (despite the official ban) to escape to the cities where they could earn or beg for food. Many of them died in the streets. In 1933, the street-cleaning service of [[Kiev]] picked up 9472 dead bodies. Only 3991 of them were officially registered while 5481 were disposed of without formal registration according to the instructions of the prosecutor's office.&lt;ref name=Volkov/&gt;

==Preparation==
The official commission for the preparation of the census was formed on 16 September 1935. It included:
* [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], the Chairman of [[Sovnarkom]],
* [[Lazar Kaganovich]], Narkom for transport,
* [[Anastas Mikoyan]], Narkom for the food industry,
* [[N. K. Antipov]], Vice Chairman of Sovnarkom,
* [[Nikolai Bulganin]], Chairman of [[Mossovet]],
* [[Emmanuil Kviring]], Vice Chairman of [[Gosplan]],
* [[I. A. Kraval]], the chief of TsUNKhU,
* [[A. S. Popov]], deputy to the chief of TsUNKhU.
Later the commission was joined by
* [[Valery Mezhlauk]], the Chairman of [[Gosplan]], who chaired the commission.
All the documents related to the census were prepared by TsUNKhU and edited personally by Joseph Stalin. A. G. Volkov speculates that never in modern history was such a routine technical matter as a census so micromanaged by such high officials.&lt;ref name=Volkov/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

While his Soviet contemporaries{{Who|date=February 2010}} praised Stalin's clarity and brevity in the design of these forms, modern scholars{{Who|date=February 2010}} have observed a significant dumbing-down of the original proposals. A lot of information, e.g., about the social structures and income, and migration, could not be deduced from the new forms. Some questions (like the social category) were extremely vague and allowed different interpretations. Volkov argues that it was done deliberately. Stalin removed the double accounting (of those present at the time of census and of those permanently living at an address), thus significantly reducing the accuracy of the calculations. It was coupled with a very maladroit time for the census: the night from 5 to 6 January – that is, the eve of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] [[Christmas]], when people are extremely mobile.

The main new question introduced by Stalin was the question about religion. According to Volkov, Stalin expected the great majority of people to self-identify as [[atheist]]s.

==Census==
The census was held on 6 January 1937. In addition to the general census in the cities, towns and villages, a special census was held by the [[NKVD]] in the [[Gulag]] camps and among the border guards; by the [[Red Army]], which took a census of military personnel; and the railroad, which took a census of passengers. When the data was first processed, it soon became obvious that the final enumeration would be little more than 162 million people. The worst disagreement between the expected and the obtained data were in [[Kazakhstan]], [[Ukraine]], [[North Caucasus]] and the [[Volga]] region, the areas that were the strongest hit by the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1934]].&lt;ref name=Andreyev/&gt; Also, despite the expected number of living prisoners of the Gulag to be 4 million, only 2.6 million were accounted for.&lt;ref name=Volkov/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andreyev/&gt;

On 11 January the chief of TsUNKhU Kraval sent telegrams requesting a total recount of a whole settlement if any doubt arose that somebody might be missing there. Still, despite the total recount in 25,000 settlements, only 4,887 previously unenumerated persons were found.&lt;ref name=Volkov/&gt; The preliminary result of the census, reported to Stalin in the middle of March 1937, was 162,039,470 people, much lower than the "criminally decreased" registered numbers of 170–172 million or Stalin's expectation of 180 million people.

Another serious blow was a very high percentage of people who stated that they were religious. 55.3 million, or 56.7%, of those who provided answers stated that they were religious (the question was asked only of people older than 16 years old), 42.2 million stated that they were atheists, and around 1 million refused to give an answer. Historian V. B. Zhiromskaya stated that people expected to be persecuted if they declared themselves as belonging to a religion, but considered the answer to be important: ''If many people would say that they are religious, the authorities would have to open the churches'', was a common attitude.&lt;ref name=Krotov&gt;V. B. Zhiromskaya, [http://www.krotov.info/history/20/1930/1937_zher.htm ''On the religiosity of people in 1937 (using the census data)''], Исторический вестник, №5 (1, 2000){{ru icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet authorities were so upset by the results of the census that they did not include a question on religion in any future censuses.&lt;ref name=Volkov/&gt;

==Aftermath==

In March 1937 the four main statistical professionals working on the Census in TsUNKhU &amp;ndash; the chief of the ''Sector for Population'', Mikhail Kurman; chief of the ''Census Bureau'', Olimpiy Kvitkin; his deputy, Lazar Brand; and the chief of the ''Sector for transportation and communication'', Ivan Oblomov, were arrested and imprisoned. Soon they were joined by the Chief of TsUNKhU, Ivan Kraval, and the chiefs of most of the regional statistical centers, and executions followed. Many statisticians, newly appointed in place of those arrested, were soon arrested themselves. There is evidence that many managers appointed to lead the statistical organization tried to avoid starting their new jobs in desperate attempts to escape persecution.&lt;ref name="Andreyev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Volkov" /&gt;

On 25 September 1937 there was a special Sovnarkom decision proclaiming the census invalid and setting a new one for January 1939. A ''[[Pravda]]'' editorial stated that the "[[Enemy of the people|enemies of the people]] gave the census counters invalid instructions that led to the gross under-counting of the population, but the brave NKVD under the leadership of [[Nikolai Yezhov]] destroyed the snake's nest in the statistical bodies".&lt;ref&gt;''All-Union population Census'', [[Pravda]], 27 July 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalin had to agree with the lower numbers of population growth. In his report to the [[18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)]] he said:&lt;ref&gt;Сталин И. В. Отчетный доклад на XVIII съезде партии о работе ЦК ВКП(б) 10 марта 1939 г. М.: 1939. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Some workers of the old Gosplan thought that during the second [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plan]] (1933–1938) the annual growth of population was three to four million people. It was a fantasy or worse.}}

The new Soviet Census (1939) showed a population figure of 170.6 million people, manipulated so as to match exactly the numbers stated by Stalin in his report to the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party. No other censuses were conducted until 1959.&lt;ref name=Volkov/&gt;

Today there is a consensus{{by whom|date=August 2010}} that the results of the 1939 census were adjusted (0.5 to 1.5 million persons were added to the reported population){{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. Some historians {{Who|date=February 2010}} consider the 1937 census the only more or less reliable source of demographic data for the period 1926–1959. However, demographers do not consider it as such{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. The data became influential for evaluating the number of victims of the [[Great Purge]], [[World War I]], and the 1930s famines, including the [[Holodomor]].&lt;ref&gt;For example:

{{Refimprove|date=December 2010}}
A '''station chief''' is a government official who is the head of a team, post or function usually in a foreign country. Historically it commonly referred to the head of a defensible structure such as an [[ambassador]]'s residence or colonial outpost.{{cn|date=July 2014}}  In Germany a {{lang|de|Stationsleiter}} (station leader) was the government's chief representative in a colonial possession such as the [[South Sea Islands]]. It may also be used to refer to the manager of remote scientific stations such as those in the [[Antarctic]] and  [[Jarvis Island]], an uninhabited minor U.S. Pacific island possession.

==CIA==
The Station Chief, also called Chief of Station, is the top U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] official stationed in a foreign country who manages all CIA operations in that country, equivalent to a KGB [[Resident spy|Rezident]]. The station chief is often a senior U.S. intelligence officer who represents the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] (ODNI) in his or her respective foreign government, whose name may ("declared status") or may not ("undeclared status") be officially revealed to the host nation and other intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Other CIA offices in foreign countries, usually performing logistics and other support functions and subordinate to the Station, are known as '''Bases''' and are headed by '''Chiefs of Base'''.

'''''The Hotline''''' is a daily political briefing published, alongside ''[[National Journal]]'', by [[Atlantic Media]] from its headquarters at [[The Watergate]] complex in [[Washington, D.C.]]. It is currently edited by Kyle Trygstad. ''The Hotline'' was founded by [[Doug Bailey]] and [[Roger Craver]] in 1987, and published independently until its acquisition in 1996 by National Journal Group, now a subsidiary of Atlantic Media. 

''The Hotline'''s primary audience includes Congressional staffers, [[political operative]]s and [[Pundit (expert)|pundits]]. It is a comprehensive, [[Nonpartisan|non-partisan]] digest of that day's political events relating to upcoming statewide and national elections. The Hotline is published daily, condensing newspaper, magazine and digital political coverage from the previous 24 hours.

''The Hotline'' comes out with a daily compendium of the morning's political headlines with "Wake-Up Call" and puts together a comprehensive digest of election and campaign news across the country with "Latest Edition." ''The Hotline'' reporters contribute to ''National Journal'''s overall political coverage. 

"I've always thought of ''Hotline'' fondly," reflected former President [[Bill Clinton]] in a [http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid635367679001?bckey=AQ~~,AAAAACpvMpk~,rAvHhAS7JOpa4tlt0CXVebDvGzQCdYY2&amp;bctid=2589612054001 25th-anniversary video]. "The day before the first cattle-call of the 1992 campaign, you all called me 'a Little Rock in a big pile.' So you can see why I'm both surprised and delighted that you've lasted 25 years. I'm a little surprised I've lasted 25 years. And I sincerely hope that you and I last another 25 more." 

Notable alumni include: Josh Kraushaar, Reid Wilson, [[Amy Walter]], [[Chuck Todd]], [[Stephen F. Hayes]], Jonathan Martin, Mike Memoli, Shira T. Center, [[Marc Ambinder]], [[Craig Crawford]], [[Norah O'Donnell]], [[Ken Rudin]], John Mercurio and Adam Wollner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3491">"'''Usual channels'''" is a term used in [[British politics]] to describe the relationship between the [[Whip (politics)|whip]]s of the Government and the [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Opposition]]. Essentially, this is to obtain co-operation between the two parties, in order to ensure as much business as possible can be dealt with in each parliamentary session.

Negotiations in the "usual channels" take place daily, with key roles being played by civil servants such as the private secretary to the Chief Whip. They determine how the time in each House of Parliament is spent and, prior to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], they decided the composition and the chair of [[Select committee (Westminster system)|select committee]]s.

In 2002, the [[Hansard Society]] published a report entitled ''Opening Up The Usual Channels'', which concluded that the Commons would benefit from greater transparency if the system were to be replaced by a formal "business committee" as used in other legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Rush | first = Michael | author2 = Clare Ettinghausen | title = Opening Up The Usual Channels | publisher = [[Hansard Society]] | date = December 2002 | location = London | url = http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/blogs/publications/archive/2007/09/01/opening-up-the-usual-channels.aspx | isbn = 978-0-900432-86-6 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120222054909/http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/blogs/publications/archive/2007/09/01/opening-up-the-usual-channels.aspx | archivedate = 2012-02-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[The Constitution Unit]] at [[University College London|UCL]] made similar recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/publications/unit-publications/135.pdf | title = Managing Parliament Better? A Business Committee for the House of Commons | first = Meg | last = Russell |author2=Akash Paun  |date=August 2006 | publisher = [[The Constitution Unit]] | location = London | pages = 38 | accessdate = 15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, following the [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|Parliamentary expenses scandal]], a temporary Reform of the House of Commons select committee, the [[Wright Committee]], was established to consider issues of [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] reform. The recommendations in their report included the establishment of a backbench business committee and the election of select committee chairs, which would fundamentally change the way the usual channels work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Following the general election in May 2010, a [[Backbench Business Committee]] was established in June, which is responsible for determining the business of the House of Commons for one day each week. Also, for the first time, chairs of select committees were elected by secret ballot by the whole House, while select committee members were elected internally within each party group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1871">The '''Vanguard Nationalist and Socialist Party''' was a minor political party in the [[Bahamas]] in the 1970s and 1980s. 

The party was founded in 1971 by a group belonging to the youth organization of [[Progressive Liberal Party]] who were inspired by the [[Black Panther Party]] in the United States. In the [[Bahamian general election, 1977|1977 elections]] it put up five candidates, but received only 55 votes and failed to win a seat. John T. McCartney became party president in 1979, and whilst it improved its performance in the [[Bahamian general election, 1982|1982 elections]], with 18 candidates receiving 181 votes, it still failed to win a seat.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen, D. (2005), ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', pp. 79-82. {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last election contested by the party was the a [[by-election]] in St. Barnabas in 1987, which was not contested by the official opposition [[Free National Movement]]. The party's candidate was its then-leader, Lionel Carey. Carey came bottom in the poll, below the [[Workers' Party (Bahamas)|Workers' Party]].

The party was never taken seriously by most Bahamian voters, a fact reflected in their abysmal vote totals. Every single candidate that ever ran on behalf of the party lost their deposit (their 1982 manifesto called for its elimination).&lt;ref&gt;''Nassau Guardian'', Election Special, 10 June 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Members addressed each other as 'comrade', which was also lampooned.

Denise Balkissoon, writing in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', disagreed with and criticized the view that 2014 marked a "watershed" moment and that "some collective 'we' has finally had enough", citing her ongoing concerns regarding a "broken system" with respect to [[violence against women]].&lt;ref&gt;Balkissoon, Denise.

Marlene Leung of CTV News described 2014 as "the year women joined forces online and the Internet listened".&lt;ref name=Leung24December2014 /&gt;  The Twitter campaign [[YesAllWomen|#YesAllWomen]], offering examples of [[sexism]] and harassment, attracted over one million tweets within four days in May. The [[hashtag]] was created after the [[2014 Isla Vista killings|Isla Vista killings]] in California, a killing spree in which the killer's [[misogyny]] was cited as a factor.&lt;ref name=Leung24December2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=SolnitMotherJones/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sasha Weiss, [http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-power-of-yesallwomen "The Power Of #YesAllWomen"], ''The New Yorker'', 26 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[street harassment]] of women was highlighted when actor Shoshana Roberts was hired by [[Hollaback!]] to walk through the streets of New York City. Their two-minute video, ''[[10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman]]'', filmed over a period of ten hours, showed 108 instances described as harassment, including comments from men regarding Roberts' appearance. She received online threats after the video aired.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Sullivan, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/29/video-woman-harassed-108-times-as-she-walks-around-new-york/ "Video: Woman harassed 108 times as she walks around New York"], ''The Washington Post'', 29 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bethonie Butler, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/10/29/the-story-behind-that-10-hours-of-walking-in-nyc-viral-street-harassment-video/ "The story behind that '10 hours of walking in NYC' viral street harassment video"], ''The Washington Post'', 29 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mashable&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buck|first1=Stephanie|title=What do men think of catcalling?

Responding to the heightened awareness of rape in India after the [[2012 Delhi gang rape]] and the [[2014 Badaun gang rape allegations]], Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] advised parents, during his [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]] speech in August, not only to ask where their daughters are going, but to check on their sons, because "a rapist is also somebody's son".&lt;ref name=SolnitOutlook&gt;Rebecca Solnit, [http://www.outlookindia.com/article/A-Watershed-Year-For-Feminism/292606 "A Watershed Year For Feminism"], ''Outlook'', 19 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaveree Bamzai, [http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/narendra-modi-feminist-independence-day-gender-issues-jashodaben/1/377313.html "Narendra Modi, the first feminist"], ''India Today'', 15 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Indian politician, [[Mulayam Singh Yadav]], opposing the introduction of the death penalty for rape, said in April "boys will be boys&amp;nbsp;... they commit mistakes", gaining considerable notoriety,&lt;ref&gt;Mohd Faisal Fareed, [http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/mulayam-singh-yadav-questions-death-penalty-for-rape-says-boys-make-mistakes/ "Mulayam’s shocker: Boys will be boys, they make mistakes ...

Krishna Majumdar of the [[National Federation of Indian Women]] wrote in July that the Delhi and Badaun attacks were "nothing less than landmarks for women in India – landmarks in their consciousness of what men do, and can do, to them", and that "the machismo of the male, sexual assault or the fear of it, will not let women be truly free".&lt;ref name="Mainstream Weekly"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mainstreamweekly.net/article5061.html | title=Rape and the Politics of Hate | publisher=Mainstream Weekly | date=14 July 2014 | author=Krishna Majumdar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic book ''[[Priya's Shakti]]'' (December 2014) featured a female Indian rape survivor as its hero; Priya is banished when her family learns about the rape, but with the help of the Hindu goddess [[Parvati]], she rides back on a tiger and is victorious.&lt;ref&gt;Geeta Pandey, [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-30288173 "India's new comic 'super hero': Priya, the rape survivor"], BBC News, 7 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] delivered the weekly presidential address in May to highlight the [[Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping]] in Nigeria, in which around 270 schoolgirls were kidnapped by an Islamist group. She argued that it was not an isolated incident: "It's a story we see every day as girls around the world risk their lives to pursue their ambitions."&lt;ref&gt;Tracy McVeigh, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/10/michelle-obama-nigeria-presidential-address "Michelle Obama raises pressure over kidnapped schoolgirls"], ''The Guardian'', 11 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's allegations of assault or harassment at the hands of prominent men&amp;nbsp;– including [[Bill Cosby]] in the United States and [[Jian Ghomeshi]] in Canada&amp;nbsp;– added to the debate about the abuse of women by men in power, and the difficulty of reporting it and being believed.&lt;ref name=Solnit30Dec2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillis13Nov2014&gt;Charlie Gillis, [http://www.macleans.ca/society/life/is-this-a-watershed-moment-in-the-battle-against-sexual-harassment/ "Is this a watershed in battle against sexual harassment?"], ''Maclean's'', 13 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anna Maria Tremonti]], [http://www.cbc.ca/news/sexism-and-violence-against-women-may-be-getting-attention-but-some-say-the-watershed-moment-is-still-to-come-nov-6-2014-1.2825834 "Sexism and violence against women may be getting attention, but some say the watershed moment is still to come"], [[The Current (radio program)|''The Current'']], CBC Radio One, 6 November 2014, from 02:08 mins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Wherry, [http://www.macleans.ca/politics/two-liberal-mps-suspended-over-allegations-of-personal-misconduct/ "Two Liberal MPs suspended over allegations of personal misconduct"], ''Maclean's'', 5 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scotland Yard]]'s [[Operation Yewtree]] in the UK, an investigation triggered by the [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal]], led to convictions for the sexual assault of women or girls against [[Max Clifford]], [[Rolf Harris]] and [[Dave Lee Travis]], all well-known men in the media and entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;Anni Donaldson, [http://theconversation.com/time-to-finish-off-page-3-and-tackle-everydaysexism-by-handing-out-a-few-prizes-35351 "Time to finish off Page 3 – and tackle #everydaysexism – by handing out a few 'prizes'"], ''The Conversation'', 10 December 2014.&lt;p&gt;

===Campus rape===
In college campuses in the US, the idea of affirmative consent to sex was promoted, referred to as "yes means yes". In January, President [[Barack Obama]] launched the [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/04/29/fact-sheet-not-alone-protecting-students-sexual-assault "Fact Sheet: Not Alone – Protecting Students from Sexual Assault"], White House, 29 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and in September, California Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed SB 967,&lt;ref name="Young2014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://time.com/3222176/campus-rape-the-problem-with-yes-means-yes/ | title=Campus Rape: The Problem With ‘Yes Means Yes’ | work=Time | date=29 August 2014 | accessdate=28 January 2015 | author=Young, Cathy}}&lt;/ref&gt; legislation requiring colleges to adopt affirmative-consent policies.&lt;ref&gt;Emanuella Grinberg, [http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/03/living/affirmative-consent-school-policy/ "Schools preach 'enthusiastic' yes in sex consent education"], CNN, 29 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The new law defined consent to sex as an "affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity"; lack of protest and silence would not constitute consent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB967 "Senate Bill No. 967"], California Legislative Information.&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmative consent was criticized by [[Cathy Young]] who said government involvement in sexual activity was a "terrible idea" and that she did not believe this would protect against sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Young2014" /&gt;

In September at [[Columbia University]] in New York, art student [[Emma Sulkowicz]] began carrying a mattress with her on campus, in what she called ''[[Mattress Performance: Carry That Weight]]'', in protest to the university's alleged mishandling of a rape complaint she had filed, where the student she accused was found "not responsible".&lt;ref name=ValentiNoMeansNo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valenti|first1=Jessica|title=Beyond 'no means no': the future of campus rape prevention is 'yes means yes'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/02/-sp-campus-rape-prevention-yes-means-yes|website=The Guardian|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Grigoriadis, [http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/09/emma-sulkowicz-campus-sexual-assault-activism.html "Meet the College Women Who Are Starting a Revolution Against Campus Sexual Assault"], ''New York Magazine'', 21 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The following month students at several universities in the US and Europe joined her protest against campus sexual assault, carrying mattresses on their campuses.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Svokos, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/29/carry-that-weight-columbia-sexual-assault_n_6069344.html "Students Bring Out Mattresses In Huge 'Carry That Weight' Protest Against Sexual Assault"], ''The Huffington Post'', 29 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Hess, [http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/10/30/carry_that_weight_emma_sulkowicz_s_mattress_becomes_a_national_movement.html "Emma Sulkowicz Inspired Students Across the Country to Carry Their Mattresses.

Online threats of violence against women were highlighted during [[Gamergate controversy|Gamergate]], a controversy about the treatment of women in video gaming.&lt;ref name=SolnitOutlook/&gt; American video-game developers [[Zoë Quinn]] and [[Brianna Wu]] were forced to leave their homes after threats, as was media critic [[Anita Sarkeesian]], who researches [[Sexism in video gaming|sexism in video games]]; Sarkeesian cancelled a lecture at [[Utah State University]] because, for legal reasons, it could not screen attendees for concealed weapons despite the threat of a school shooting if she spoke there.&lt;ref&gt;Soraya Nadia McDonald, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/15/gamergate-feminist-video-game-critic-anita-sarkeesian-cancels-utah-lecture-after-threat-citing-police-inability-to-prevent-concealed-weapons-at-event/ "Anita Sarkeesian cancels Utah lecture after threat"], ''The Washington Post'', 15 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran and Saudi Arabia===
On Facebook, women in Iran posted images of themselves without veils in a movement known as [[My Stealthy Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;Julia Carpenter, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/05/16/iranian-women-shed-hijabs-for-stealthy-freedoms-facebook-page/ "Iranian women shed hijabs for 'Stealthy Freedoms' Facebook page"], ''The Washington Post'', 16 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In Saudi Arabia in December, two women involved in the [[Women to drive movement|#womentodrive]] movement were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30602155 "Saudi terrorism court 'to try women drivers'"], BBC News, 25 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==

[[File:Portrait Najat Vallaud-Belkacem-crop.jpg|Then French Minister of Women's rights [[Najat Vallaud-Belkacem]] proposed the French gender equality law|thumb]]
In August, France passed what a ''New York Times'' editorial described as the most comprehensive law on gender equality in that country to date, ''Loi pour l'égalité réelle entre les femmes et les hommes''.&lt;ref name=editorial/&gt; The law allows for [[abortion]] on demand in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Women previously had to be "in distress" to obtain an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Anderson (6 August 2014) [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/06/us-france-women-idUSKBN0G61OO20140806 France passes sweeping gender equality law] Reuters.&lt;/ref&gt; Provisions were changed to encourage more men to take paternal leave and requiring workplaces to improve gender equality or face fines.&lt;ref name=editorial/&gt; There are also several provisions to strengthen the fight against [[domestic abuse]].

In September, Spain's Prime Minister, [[Mariano Rajoy]], announced that the government would abandon a proposed law to strengthen the [[Abortion in Spain|abortion law in Spain]] which would have banned abortions except in cases of rape or to protect the health of the mother. The proposal, which was introduced by the [[People's Party (Spain)|People Party]]'s cabinet in December 2013, had been met with large protests through 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Ashifa Kassam (23 September 2014) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/spain-abandons-plan-introduce-tough-new-abortion-laws 'Spain abandons plan to introduce tough new abortion laws'], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/dropped-anti-abortion-bill-must-usher-better-protection-women-s-rights-spain-2014-09-23 "Dropped anti-abortion bill must usher in better protection of women's rights in Spain"], Amnesty International, 23 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, Canada changed their prostitution laws to follow the [[Prostitution in Sweden|Swedish model]], which focuses prosecution on those who purchase sexual services.  The purchasing and advertisement of sexual services became illegal (except for the advertisement by individual sex workers), while selling sex remained legal.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Batha, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/05/us-canada-prostitution-idUSKCN0JJ1CN20141205 "Controversial Canadian law criminalizes men who buy sex"], Reuters, 5 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Schwartz, [http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/politics/new-prostitution-laws-unlikely-to-be-challenged-soon-legal-experts-say-1.2870523 "New prostitution laws unlikely to be challenged soon, legal experts say"], CBC News, 12 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The move was supported by a coalition of women's rights groups, the Women's Coalition for the Abolition of Prostitution, but was criticized by [[Human Rights Watch]] and the Feminist Coalition, who argued that it would force sex workers into isolated environments.&lt;ref&gt;James Keller, [http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/05/29/womens-coalition-plannin_n_3354290.html "Legalizing Prostitution Challenge By Women's Coalition"], The Canadian Press, 29 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Amon, [http://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/joseph-amon-canadas-prostitution-bill-a-step-in-the-wrong-direction "Canada's prostitution bill a step in the wrong direction"], ''Ottawa Citizen'', 18 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Doe, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/why-the-prostitution-bill-will-increase-violence-against-sex-workers/article19704999/ "Why the prostitution bill will increase violence against sex workers"], ''The Globe and Mail'', 22 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar proposal was approved by the French [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] in 2013, but the [[Senate (France)|Senate]] in 2014 did not pass the bill. Rosen Hitcher, a former prostitute and abolition advocate, walked 800&amp;nbsp;km (500 m) from Saintes, in southwestern France, to Paris to protest the Senate's decision. She was supported by [[Pascale Boistard]], minister for women's rights, and the mayors of several cities, including [[Anne Hidalgo]], the mayor of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Francois Becker, [https://news.yahoo.com/ex-prostitute-ends-long-march-french-bill-penalise-203330750.html "Ex-prostitute ends long march for French bill to penalise clients"], [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], 12 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.rfi.fr/france/20141012-french-ex-prostitute-ends-long-march-support-fines-clients-law "French ex-prostitute ends long march to support fines for clients"], RFI, 13 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Economic Forum, United Nations==
[[File:HeForShe Logo Badge withTagline Use On White.png|thumb|[[Emma Watson]] launched the UN's [[HeForShe]] campaign.]]

The [[World Economic Forum]]'s 2014 [[Global Gender Gap Report]], measuring the allocation of resources between women and men in health, education, economy and politics, ranked [[Human rights in Iceland#Family rights and gender equality|Iceland]], [[Women in Finland|Finland]], [[Feminism in Norway|Norway]], Sweden and [[Women in Denmark|Denmark]] highest on their Global Gender Gap Index, while [[Women in Yemen|Yemen]], [[Women in Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Women in Chad|Chad]], [[Women in Syria|Syria]] and [[Women in Mali|Mali]] were among those ranked the lowest.  Globally, the health and survival gap was 96% and the educational attainment gap was 94%, with some countries closing the gap entirely.  However, the gap related to improvement for women in the workplace was found to be 60%, having closed by only 4% since 2006.  Although it showed the most improvement, the political empowerment gap remained at just 21%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Klaus Schwab]], [http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2014/preface/ "Preface"], ''Global Gender Gap Report 2014'', World Economic Forum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2014/rankings/ "Rankings"], ''Global Gender Gap Report 2014'', World Economic Forum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World Economic Forum"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-gender-gap-report-2014 | title=The Global Gender Gap Report 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | date=2014 | accessdate=10 January 2015 |author1=Bekhouche Yasmina |author2=Hausmann, Ricardo |author3=D’Andrea Tyson, Laura }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a visit to the UK in April, the [[United Nations]]' [[Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women]], [[Rashida Manjoo]], criticized the country's "boys' club sexist culture". She argued that sexism in the UK was more "pervasive" and "in your face" than other countries she had visited, which included Algeria, Italy, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Azerbaijan, India and Croatia. She cited issues such the sexist portrayal of women in public, including the female nudity on [[Page Three]] of the ''Sun'' newspaper, bullying of girls in schools, and harassment in public spaces. [[Laura Bates]], the founder of the [[Everyday Sexism Project]], commented on Manjoo's criticisms calling them "a wake-up call to recognise the depth and severity of the problem. We still have gender inequality in the UK [yet] we are so quick to point the finger at other countries and suggest women [here] are equal."&lt;ref&gt;Harriet Sherwood, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/15/un-special-rapporteur-manjoo-yarls-wood-home-office "UN special rapporteur criticises Britain's 'in-your-face' sexist culture"], ''The Guardian'', 15 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Morrison, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/boys-club-britain-is-more-sexist-than-italy-azerbaijan-and-india-says-un-human-rights-expert-9262615.html "Boys' club Britain is more sexist than Italy, Azerbaijan and India, says UN human rights expert"], ''The Independent'', 15 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rashdia Manjoo, [http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14514&amp; "Special Rapporteur on violence against women finalizes country mission to the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland ..."], Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, United Nations, 15 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July meeting with activists and journalists at the end of an investigatory visit, Manjoo heard complaints and criticized the Mexican government's record on gender inequality in public agencies, describing verbal harassment and sexual harassment as forms of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Lopez, [http://www.latintimes.com/rashida-manjoo-un-special-rapporteur-violence-against-women-enrique-pena-nieto-not-good-191382 Rashida Manjoo, UN Special Rapporteur On Violence Against Women, To Enrique Peña Nieto: Not Good Enough!], ''Latin Times'', 13 July 2014. Accessed 11 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; She said that violence against women "is acknowledged as a pervasive and widespread human rights violation" and that "no single country can claim that there is progressive elimination occurring". She said that two UN reports on the US in 2014 highlighted a disproportionate level of violence experienced by women from ethnic and racial minorities, mirroring findings in her own report of 2011 and similarly urging that the government do more to address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Rashida Manjoo, [https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/iachr_submission_27_oct_2014_by_unsrvaw.pdf Hearing Submission: Jessica Lenahan (Gonzales) v.

The BBC reported that the role of women within the UN was increasing. As of November 2014, there were 31 female [[Permanent Representative to the United Nations|permanent representatives]], and six seats (Argentina, Jordan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Nigeria and the United States) out of fifteen on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] were held by women. Most of the senior positions remained with men, including the current and all previous [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|secretaries-general]].&lt;ref&gt;Nick Bryant, [https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30012139 "At the UN, women play increasingly powerful roles"], BBC News, 16 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
