The '''1998 East Java ninja scare''' was an outbreak of [[mass hysteria]] in [[East Java]], [[Indonesia]], in which the local population believed they were being targeted by sorcerers known as [[ninja]], who were blamed for mysterious killings of religious leaders by assassins dressed in black. As many as 150-300 “sorcerers” were killed between February and October, with the most deaths occurring between August and September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/20/world/fears-of-sorcerers-spur-killings-in-java.html|title=Fears of Sorcerers Spur Killings in Java|first=Nicholas D.|last=Kristof|date=20 October 1998|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

According to Jason Brown, [[Banyuwangi Regency|Banyuwangi]] is a centre of black magic in Indonesia. Black magic practiced in Banyuwangi is a mix of animist beliefs and Islamic mysticism which developed from inter-religious conflict during the 16th century Mataram court period. Belief in black magic, or [[Dukun|dukun santet]], is widespread in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideindonesia.org/the-banyuwangi-murders|title=The Banyuwangi murders - Inside Indonesia|website=insideindonesia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

The killings began in [[Banyuwangi Regency]] in February. Organized assassins, dressed in black from which they gained the name ninja, began attacking leaders affiliated with [[Nahdlatul Ulama]]. Local people began to hunt down and kill anyone who they believed to be ‘ninjas’ in response. About five people were killed between February and July. In the month of August, 40 people were killed, and in September the number rose to 80.

On 18 October 1998, five men were killed in the Turen area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/20/world/fears-of-sorcerers-spur-killings-in-java.html|title=Fears of Sorcerers Spur Killings in Java|first=Nicholas D.|last=Kristof|date=20 October 1998|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; One was beaten to death, one was burned and three were beheaded. On 20 October 1998, three killings occurred. Two had been seized from a police car by vigilantes who reportedly slit their throats, and the third was the man whose head was paraded on a stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/20/world/fears-of-sorcerers-spur-killings-in-java.html|title=Fears of Sorcerers Spur Killings in Java|first=Nicholas D.|last=Kristof|date=20 October 1998|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October at Godanglegi, near [[Malang]], another five suspected ninjas were killed by villagers. One victim was burnt to death while another was beheaded.

===Local press reports===

On 1 October 1998, the Surabaya Post reported  “a rumour about the existence of attacks by ninja-like squads” that were targeting “community leaders as well as [[ulama]]. As a result, the residents near Islamic boarding schools undertake tight guards around the houses of ulamas who have become targets.” On 4 October 1998, the Jawa Pos  reported that “prayer teachers are in the sights of groups of dozens of killers who wear all-black clothes and masks like ninjas.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmandala.org/hunting-killing-ninjas-indonesia/|title=Hunting and killing ninjas in Indonesia - New Mandala|date=3 May 2016|website=newmandala.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casualties===

A Nahdlatul Ulama investigation team found that 143 ‘ninja’ were killed in Banyuwangi and 105 in other regions of East Java such as [[Jember]], [[Sumenep]] and [[Pasuruan]], making the total documented death toll 248, though it may be higher.

===Theories===

There have been a number of theories regarding who was behind the original organised killing of the Nahdlatul Ulama religious leaders. [[Abdurrahman Wahid]], then head of [[Nahdlatul Ulama]], claimed they were ordered by elite politicians.

'''Aegle''' ({{lang-grc|Αἴγλη}} "brightness" or "dazzling light") is the name of several different figures in [[Greek mythology]]:
*Aegle, one of the daughters of [[Asclepius]] by [[Epione]], according to the [[Suda]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Suda]], ''s.v.'' {{lang|grc|Ἠπιόνη}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by [[Lampetia]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' 35. 40. § 31&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of the Sun, according to [[Hermippus]],.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hermippus]], in [[Scholia]] in [[Aristophanes]], ''Plutos'' 701&lt;/ref&gt;  Her name is said to have derived from "Αἴγλη" ("Aegle"), meaning "Brightness," or "Splendor," either from the beauty of the human body when in good health, or from the honor paid to the medical profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Greenhill  | first = William Alexander  | contribution = Aegle (5)  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 27  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0036.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Theosophy}}
'''Annie Besant''', [[née]] Wood (1 October 1847 – 20 September 1933) was a British [[socialist]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]], [[women's rights]] activist, writer, [[orator]], and supporter of both Irish and Indian self-rule.

In 1867, Annie, at age 20, married Frank Besant, a clergyman, and they had two children. However, Annie's increasingly anti-religious views led to their legal separation in 1873.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/besant_annie.shtml "Annie Besant (1847–1933)" BBC UK Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; She then became a prominent speaker for the [[National Secular Society]] (NSS), as well as a writer, and a close friend of [[Charles Bradlaugh]]. In 1877 they were prosecuted for publishing a book by birth control campaigner [[Charles Knowlton]]. The scandal made them famous, and Bradlaugh was subsequently elected [[Member of Parliament|M.P.]] for Northampton in 1880.

Thereafter, she became involved with union actions, including the [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]] demonstration and the [[London matchgirls strike of 1888]]. She was a leading speaker for both the [[Fabian Society]] and the [[Marxist]] [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF). She was also elected to the [[London School Board]] for [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], topping the poll, even though few women were qualified to vote at that time.

In 1890 Besant met [[Helena Blavatsky]], and over the next few years her interest in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] grew, whilst her interest in secular matters waned. She became a member of the [[Theosophical Society]] and a prominent lecturer on the subject. As part of her theosophy-related work, she travelled to India. In 1898 she helped establish the [[Central Hindu College]], and in 1922 she helped establish the [[Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board]] in [[Mumbai]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History and Development of the Board |url=http://www.hsncb.com/about-us/default.htm |website= Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924220053/http://hsncb.com/about-us/default.htm |archivedate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, she established the first overseas Lodge of the International Order of Co-Freemasonry, ''[[Le Droit Humain]]''. Over the next few years she established lodges in many parts of the [[British Empire]]. In 1907 she became president of the [[Theosophical Society]], whose international headquarters were, by then, located in [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]], [[Madras]], ([[Chennai]]).

She also became involved in politics in India, joining the [[Indian National Congress]]. When [[World War I]] broke out in 1914, she helped launch the [[Indian Home Rule Movement|Home Rule League]] to campaign for democracy in India, and dominion status within the British Empire. This led to her election as president of the India National Congress, in late 1917. In the late 1920s, Besant travelled to the United States with her protégé and adopted son [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], who she claimed was the new Messiah and incarnation of Buddha. Krishnamurti rejected these claims in 1929.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; After the war, she continued to campaign for Indian independence and for the causes of theosophy, until her death in 1933.

She started the central Hindu school in Benares as a chief means of achieving her objective.

==Early life==
[[File:Sibsey church tower.JPG|left|thumb|St. Margaret's church, Sibsey, where Frank Besant was vicar, 1871–1917]]
Annie Wood was born in 1847 in London into a middle-class family of [[Irish people|Irish]] origin. She was proud of her heritage and supported the cause of Irish [[self-rule]] throughout her adult life. Her father died when she was five years old, leaving the family almost penniless. Her mother supported the family by running a boarding house for boys at [[Harrow School]]. However, she was unable to support Annie and persuaded her friend Ellen Marryat to care for her. Marryat made sure that she had a good education.  Annie was given a strong sense of duty to society and an equally strong sense of what independent women could achieve.&lt;ref name="0-www.oxforddnb.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu"&gt;Anne Taylor, 'Besant, Annie (1847–1933)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://0-www.oxforddnb.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu/view/article/30735, accessed 30 March 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; As a young woman, she was also able to travel widely in Europe. There she acquired a taste for [[Roman Catholic]] colour and ceremony that never left her.

In 1867, at age twenty, she married 26-year-old clergyman Frank Besant (1840–1917), younger brother of [[Walter Besant]]. He was an evangelical [[Anglican]] who seemed to share many of her concerns.&lt;ref name="0-www.oxforddnb.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu"/&gt; On the eve of her marriage, she had become more politicised through a visit to friends in Manchester, who brought her into contact with both English radicals and the [[Manchester Martyrs]] of the Irish Republican [[Fenian Brotherhood]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/2/0/8/12085/12085-h/12085-h.htm#CHIV Annie Besant: An Autobiography, London, 1885, chapter 4.]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with the conditions of the urban poor.
[[File:Annie Besant 1.jpg|thumb|Annie Besant]]
[[File:Sibsey Besant grave.JPG|right|thumb|Grave of Frank Besant at Sibsey, where he remained vicar until his death]]
Soon Frank became vicar of [[Sibsey]] in Lincolnshire. Annie moved to Sibsey with her husband, and within a few years they had two children, Arthur and Mabel; however, the marriage was a disaster. As Annie wrote in her ''Autobiography'', "we were an ill-matched pair".&lt;ref&gt;''Annie Besant: an Autobiography'' (Unwin, 1908), 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The first conflict came over money and Annie's independence. Annie wrote short stories, books for children, and articles. As married women did not have the legal right to own property, Frank was able to collect all the money she earned. Politics further divided the couple. Annie began to support farm workers who were fighting to unionise and to win better conditions. Frank was a [[Tory]] and sided with the landlords and farmers. The tension came to a head when Annie refused to attend [[Eucharist|Communion]]. In 1873 she left him and returned to London. They were legally separated and Annie took her daughter with her.

Besant began to question her own faith. She turned to leading churchmen for advice, going to see [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]], one of the leaders of the [[Oxford Movement]] within the [[Church of England]]. When she asked him to recommend books that would answer her questions, he told her she had read too many already.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/2/0/8/12085/12085-h/12085-h.htm#CHV Annie Besant: An Autobiography, London, 1885, chapter 5.]&lt;/ref&gt; Besant returned to Frank to make a last unsuccessful effort to repair the marriage. She finally left for London.

==Birkbeck==
In the late 1880s she studied at the [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Birkbeck, University of London |url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/about-us/notable-birkbeckians | title = Notable Birkbeckians |accessdate=19 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where her religious and political activities caused alarm. At one point the Institution's governors sought to withhold the publication of her exam results.&lt;ref name="BBK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/bbk/history/ |title=The History of Birkbeck |publisher=Birkbeck, University of London |accessdate=26 November 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006035925/http://www.bbk.ac.uk/bbk/history/ |archivedate = 6 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reformer and secularist==
[[File:Annie Besant - portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Annie Besant – 1880s]]
She fought for the causes, her thoughts were right, starting with [[freedom of thought]], women's rights, [[secularism]], [[birth control]], [[Fabian socialism]] and [[workers' rights]]. She was a leading member of the [[National Secular Society]] alongside [[Charles Bradlaugh]] and the [[South Place Ethical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;MacKillop, I. D. (1986) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mqgsFS_MN9UC&amp;pgis=1 The British Ethical Societies]'', Cambridge University Press (Accessed 13 May 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Divorce was unthinkable for Frank, and was not really within the reach of even middle-class people. Annie was to remain Mrs Besant for the rest of her life. At first, she was able to keep contact with both children and to have Mabel live with her; she also got a small allowance from her husband.

Once free of Frank Besant and exposed to new currents of thought, she began to question not only her long-held religious beliefs but also the whole of conventional thinking. She began to write attacks on the churches and the way they controlled people's lives. In particular she attacked the status of the [[Church of England]] as a state-sponsored faith.

Soon she was earning a small weekly wage by writing a column for the ''[[National Reformer]]'', the newspaper of the NSS. The NSS argued for a secular state and an end to the special status of Christianity, and allowed her to act as one of its public speakers. Public lectures were very popular entertainment in [[Victorian Era|Victorian]] times. Besant was a brilliant speaker, and was soon in great demand. Using the railway, she criss-crossed the country, speaking on all of the most important issues of the day, always demanding improvement, reform and freedom.

For many years Besant was a friend of the National Secular Society's leader, [[Charles Bradlaugh]]. Bradlaugh, a former soldier, had long been separated from his wife; Besant lived with him and his daughters, and they worked together on many projects. He was an [[atheist]] and a republican; he was also trying to get elected as [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Northampton]].

Besant and Bradlaugh became household names in 1877 when they published ''Fruits of Philosophy'', a book by the American birth-control campaigner [[Charles Knowlton]]. It claimed that working-class families could never be happy until they were able to decide how many children they wanted. It also suggested ways to limit the size of their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Knowlton | first = Charles | editor-last1 = Besant | editor-first1 = Annie | editor-last2 = Bradlaugh| editor-first2 = Charles | author-link = Charles Knowlton | editor-link2 = Charles Bradlaugh | title = Fruits of philosophy: a treatise on the population question | publisher = Reader's Library | location = San Francisco | date = October 1891 | origyear = 1840 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38185/38185-h/38185-h.htm | oclc = 626706770}} A publication about birth control. [https://archive.org/details/fruitsphilosoph00knogoog View original copy.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Knowlton book was highly controversial, and was vigorously opposed by the Church. Besant and Bradlaugh proclaimed in the ''National Reformer'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;We intend to publish nothing we do not think we can morally defend. All that we publish we shall defend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Annie Besant |title=Autobiographical sketches |publisher=Freethought Publishing |date=1885 |page=116 |ol=26315876M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The pair were arrested and put on trial for publishing the Knowlton book. They were found guilty, but released pending appeal. As well as great opposition, Besant and Bradlaugh also received a great deal of support in the Liberal press. Arguments raged back and forth in the letters and comment columns as well as in the courtroom. Besant was instrumental in founding the [[Malthusian League]] during the trial, which would go on to advocate for the abolition of penalties for the promotion of contraception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2173367 |title=The Malthusian League and resistance to birth control propaganda in late Victorian Britain | doi = 10.1080/00324728.1977.10412759 |journal=Population Studies |author=F. D'arcy |volume= 31| issue = 3|date= Nov 1977 |pages=429–448}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, it looked as though they would be sent to prison. The case was thrown out finally only on a technical point, the charges not having been properly drawn up.

The scandal cost Besant custody of her children. Her husband was able to persuade the court that she was unfit to look after them, and they were handed over to him permanently.

On 6 March 1881 she spoke at the opening of [[Leicester Secular Society]]'s new [[Leicester Secular Hall|Secular Hall]] in Humberstone Gate, Leicester. The other speakers were [[George Jacob Holyoake]], [[Harriet Law]] and [[Charles Bradlaugh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://leicestersecularsociety.org.uk/history_gimson.htm#%281%29 Gimson 1932]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradlaugh's political prospects were not damaged by the Knowlton scandal and he was elected to Parliament in 1881. Because of his atheism, he asked to be allowed to affirm rather than swear the oath of loyalty. When the possibility of affirmation was refused, Bradlaugh stated his willingness to take the oath. But this option was also challenged. Although many Christians were shocked by Bradlaugh, others (like the Liberal leader [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]) spoke up for freedom of belief. It took more than six years before the matter was completely resolved (in Bradlaugh's favour) after a series of by-elections and court appearances.

Meanwhile, Besant built close contacts with the [[Devolution#Irish home rule|Irish Home Rulers]] and supported them in her newspaper columns during what are considered crucial years, when the Irish nationalists were forming an alliance with Liberals and Radicals. Besant met the leaders of the Irish home rule movement. In particular, she got to know [[Michael Davitt]], who wanted to mobilise the Irish peasantry through a Land War, a direct struggle against the landowners. She spoke and wrote in favour of Davitt and his Land League many times over the coming decades.

However, Bradlaugh's parliamentary work gradually alienated Besant. Women had no part in parliamentary politics. Besant was searching for a real political outlet, where her skills as a speaker, writer and organiser could do some real good.

==Political activism==
For Besant, politics, friendship and love were always closely intertwined. Her decision in favour of Socialism came about through a close relationship with [[George Bernard Shaw]], a struggling young Irish author living in London, and a leading light of the [[Fabian Society]]. Annie was impressed by his work and grew very close to him too in the early 1880s. It was Besant who made the first move, by inviting Shaw to live with her. This he refused, but it was Shaw who sponsored Besant to join the [[Fabian Society]]. In its early days, the society was a gathering of people exploring spiritual, rather than political, [[criticism of capitalism|alternatives to the capitalist system]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward R. Pease]], ''The History of the Fabian Society'' (E. P. Dutton, 1916, rpt Aware Journalism, 2014), 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Besant began to write for the Fabians. This new commitment – and her relationship with Shaw – deepened the split between Besant and Bradlaugh, who was an individualist and opposed to Socialism of any sort. While he defended free speech at any cost, he was very cautious about encouraging working-class militancy.&lt;ref&gt;Theresa Notare, ''A Revolution in Christian Morals: Lambeth 1930-Resolution #15. History and Reception'' (ProQuest, 2008), 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unemployment was a central issue of the time, and in 1887 some of the London unemployed started to hold protests in [[Trafalgar Square]]. Besant agreed to appear as a speaker at a meeting on 13 November. The police tried to stop the assembly, fighting broke out, and troops were called. Many were hurt, one man died, and hundreds were arrested; Besant offered herself for arrest, an offer disregarded by the police.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Peters, ''Bernard Shaw: The Ascent of the Superman'' (Yale University, 1996), 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The events created a great sensation, and became known as [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]]. Besant was widely blamed – or credited – for it. She threw herself into organising legal aid for the jailed workers and support for their families.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Raj, ''Annie Besant's Rise to Power in Indian Politics, 1914–1917'' (Concept Publishing, 1981), 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradlaugh finally broke with her because he felt she should have asked his advice before going ahead with the meeting.

Another activity in this period was her involvement in the [[London matchgirls strike of 1888]]. She was drawn into this battle of the "New Unionism" by a young socialist, [[Herbert Burrows]]. He had made contact with workers at [[Bryant and May]]'s match factory in [[Bow, London]], who were mainly young women and were very poorly paid. They were also prey to industrial illnesses, like the bone-rotting [[Phossy jaw]], which was caused by the chemicals used in match manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mernick.org.uk/thhol/thelink.html "White slavery in London"] The Link, Issue no. 21 (via Tower Hamlets' Local History Library and Archives)&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the match workers asked for help from Burrows and Besant in setting up a union.

Besant met the women and set up a committee, which led the women into a strike for better pay and conditions, an action that won public support. Besant led demonstrations by "match-girls", who were cheered in the streets, and prominent churchmen wrote in their support. In just over a week they forced the firm to improve pay and conditions. Besant then helped them to set up a proper union and a social centre.

At the time, the matchstick industry was a very powerful lobby, since electric light was not yet widely available, and matches were an essential commodity; in 1872, lobbyists from the match industry had persuaded the British government to change its planned tax policy. Besant's campaign was the first time anyone had successfully challenged the match manufacturers on a major issue, and was seen as a landmark victory of the early years of British Socialism.

During 1884, Besant had developed a very close friendship with [[Edward Aveling]], a young socialist teacher who lived in her house for a time. Aveling was a scholarly figure and it was he who first translated the important works of Marx into English. He eventually went to live with [[Eleanor Marx]], daughter of [[Karl Marx]]. Aveling was a great influence on Besant's thinking and she supported his work, yet she moved towards the rival Fabians at that time. Aveling and Eleanor Marx had joined the Marxist [[Social Democratic Federation]] and then the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]], a small Marxist splinter group which formed around the artist [[William Morris]].

It seems that Morris played a large part in converting Besant to Marxism, but it was to the SDF, not his Socialist League, that she turned in 1888. She remained a member for a number of years and became one of its best speakers. She was still a member of the Fabian Society; neither she nor anyone else seemed to think the two movements incompatible at the time.

Soon after joining the Marxists, Besant was elected to the [[London School Board]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward R. Pease]], ''The History of the Fabian Society'' (E. P. Dutton, 1916, rpt Aware Journalism, 2014), 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Women at that time were not able to take part in parliamentary politics, but had been brought into the local electorate in 1881.

Besant drove about with a red ribbon in her hair, speaking at meetings. "No more hungry children", her manifesto proclaimed. She combined her socialist principles with feminism:
"I ask the electors to vote for me, and the non-electors to work for me because women are wanted on the Board and there are too few women candidates." Besant came out on top of the poll in [[Tower Hamlets (UK Parliament constituency)|Tower Hamlets]], with over 15,000 votes. She wrote in the National Reformer: "Ten years ago, under a cruel law, Christian bigotry robbed me of my little child. Now the care of the 763,680 children of London is placed partly in my hands."&lt;ref&gt;Jyoti Chandra, ''Annie Besant: from theosophy to nationalism'' (K.K. Publications, 2001), 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besant was also involved in the [[London dock strike of 1889]], in which the dockers, who were employed by the day, were led by [[Ben Tillett]] in a struggle for the "Dockers' Tanner". Besant helped Tillett draw up the union's rules and played an important part in the meetings and agitation which built up the organisation. She spoke for the dockers at public meetings and on street corners. Like the match-girls, the dockers won public support for their struggle, and the strike was won.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Cole, ''The Story of Fabian Socialism'' (Stanford University, 1961), 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theosophy==
Besant was a prolific writer and a powerful orator.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mark Bevir, ''The Making of British Socialism'' (Princeton University, 2011 ), 202.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, she was asked to write a review for the ''Pall Mall Gazette''&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens, ''Krishnamurti: The Years of Awakening'', Avon/Discus. 1983. p 13&lt;/ref&gt; on ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'', a book by [[H. P. Blavatsky]]. After reading it, she sought an interview with its author, meeting Blavatsky in Paris. In this way she was converted to Theosophy. Besant's intellectual journey had always involved a spiritual dimension, a quest for transformation of the whole person. As her interest in theosophy deepened, she allowed her membership of the Fabian Society to lapse (1890) and broke her links with the [[Marxists]]. In her ''Autobiography'', Besant follows her chapter on "Socialism" with "Through Storm to Peace", the peace of Theosophy. In 1888, she described herself as "marching toward the Theosophy" that would be the "glory" of her life. Besant had found the economic side of life lacking a spiritual dimension, so she searched for a belief based on "Love". She found this in Theosophy, so she joined the Theosophical Society, a move that distanced her from Bradlaugh and other former activist co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;Annie Besant, ''Annie Besant: an Autobiography'' (Unwin 1908), 330, 338, 340, 344, 357.&lt;/ref&gt; When Blavatsky died in 1891, Besant was left as one of the leading figures in theosophy and in 1893 she represented it at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;Emmett A. Greenwalt, ''The Point Loma Community in California, 1897–1942: A Theosophical Experiment'' (University of California, 1955), 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, soon after becoming a member of the Theosophical Society she went to India for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Kumari Jayawardena, ''The White Woman's Other Burden'' (Routledge, 1995, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; After a [[Theosophical Society#Schisms|dispute]] the American section split away into an independent organisation. The original society, then led by [[Henry Steel Olcott]] and Besant, is today based in [[Chennai]], India, and is known as the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]]. Following the split Besant devoted much of her energy not only to the society, but also to India's freedom and progress. [[Besant Nagar]], a neighbourhood near the Theosophical Society in Chennai, is named in her honour.

===Co-freemasonry===
Besant saw freemasonry, in particular [[Co-Freemasonry]], as an extension of her interest in the rights of women and the greater brotherhood of man and saw co-freemasonry as a "movement which practised true brotherhood, in which women and men worked side by side for the perfecting of humanity. She immediately wanted to be admitted to this organisation", known now as the ''International Order of Freemasonry for Men and Women, "Le Droit Humain".''

The link was made in 1902 by the theosophist Francesca Arundale, who accompanied Besant to Paris, along with six friends. "They were all initiated, passed and raised into the first three degrees and Annie returned to England, bearing a Charter and founded there the first Lodge of International Mixed Masonry, Le Droit Humain." Besant eventually became the Order's Most Puissant Grand Commander, and was a major influence in the international growth of the Order.&lt;ref&gt;The International Bulletin, 20 September 1933, The International Order of Co-Freemasonry, Le Droit Humain. "In a very short time, Sister Besant founded new lodges: three in London, three in the south of England, three in the North and North-West; she even organised one in Scotland. Travelling in 1904 with her sisters and brothers she met in the Netherlands, other brethren of a male obedience, who, being interested, collaborated in the further expansion of Le Droit Humain. Annie continued to work with such ardour that soon new lodges were formed Great Britain, South America, Canada, India, Ceylon, Australia and New Zealand. The lodges in all these countries were united under the name of the British Federation."&lt;/ref&gt;

===President of Theosophical Society===
[[File:Olcott Besant Leadbeater.jpg|thumb|Annie Besant with [[Henry Olcott]] (left) and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Charles Leadbeater]] (right) in [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]], Madras in December 1905]]
Besant met fellow theosophist [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] in London in April 1894. They became close co-workers in the theosophical movement and would remain so for the rest of their lives. Leadbeater claimed [[clairvoyance]] and reputedly helped Besant become clairvoyant herself in the following year. In a letter dated 25 August 1895 to Francisca Arundale, Leadbeater narrates how Besant became clairvoyant. Together they clairvoyantly investigated the universe, matter, thought-forms, and the history of mankind, and co-authored a book called ''[[Occult Chemistry]]''.

In 1906 Leadbeater became the centre of controversy when it emerged that he had advised the practice of masturbation to some boys under his care and spiritual instruction. Leadbeater stated he had encouraged the practice to keep the boys celibate, which was considered a prerequisite for advancement on the spiritual path.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leadbeater.org/tillettcwlchap10.htm Charles Webster Leadbeater 1854–1934: A Biographical Study, by Gregory John Tillett, 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the controversy, he offered to resign from the Theosophical Society in 1906, which was accepted. The next year Besant became president of the society and in 1908, with her express support, Leadbeater was readmitted to the society. Leadbeater went on to face accusations of improper relations with boys, but none of the accusations were ever proven and Besant never deserted him.&lt;ref&gt;Besant, Annie (2 June 1913). "Naranian v. Besant". [Letters to the Editor]. ''[[The Times]]'' (London). p. 7. {{ISSN|0140-0460}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until Besant's presidency, the society had as one of its foci [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] and the island of [[Sri Lanka]], where Henry Olcott did the majority of his useful work.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky and Olcott had become Buddhists in Sri Lanka, and promoted Buddhist revival on the subcontinent. See also: [[Maha Bodhi Society]].&lt;/ref&gt; Under Besant's leadership there was more stress on the teachings of "The Aryavarta", as she called central India, as well as on esoteric Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Singh, ''Encyclopaedia Of Indian War Of Independence (1857–1947)'' (Anmol Publications, 2009) 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besant set up a new school for boys, the [[Central Hindu College]] (CHC) at [[Banaras]] which was formed on underlying theosophical principles, and which counted many prominent theosophists in its staff and faculty. Its aim was to build a new leadership for India. The students spent 90 minutes a day in prayer and studied religious texts, but they also studied modern science. It took 3 years to raise the money for the CHC, most of which came from Indian princes.&lt;ref&gt;Kumari Jayawardena, ''The White Woman's Other Burden'' (Routledge, 1995), 128.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1911, Besant met Pandit [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] and they decided to unite their forces and work for a common Hindu University at Banaras. Besant and fellow trustees of the Central Hindu College also agreed to Government of India's precondition that the college should become a part of the new University. The [[Banaras Hindu University]] started functioning from 1 October 1917 with the Central Hindu College as its first constituent college.

Blavatsky had stated in 1889 that the main purpose of establishing the society was to prepare humanity for the future reception of a "torch-bearer of Truth", an emissary of a hidden [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] that, according to theosophists, guides the evolution of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky, H. P.]] (1889). ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]''. London: The Theosophical Publishing Company. pp. 306–307.&lt;/ref&gt; This was repeated by Besant as early as 1896; Besant came to believe in the imminent appearance of the "emissary", who was identified by theosophists as the so-called ''[[World Teacher]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wessinger, Catherine Lowman (1988). ''Annie Besant and Progressive Messianism, 1847–1933''. [[Lewiston, New York]]: [[Edwin Mellen Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-88946-523-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Music of Gounod - Annie Besant Thought Form - Project Gutenberg eText 16269.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Thoughtform|Thought-form]] of the music of [[Charles Gounod]], according to Besant and C. W. Leadbeater in ''Thought-Forms '' (1901)]]

==="World Teacher" project===
In 1909, soon after Besant's assumption of the presidency, Leadbeater "discovered" fourteen-year-old [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] (1895–1986), a South Indian boy who had been living, with his father and brother, on the grounds of the headquarters of the Theosophical Society at [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]], and declared him the probable "vehicle" for the expected "[[Maitreya (Theosophy)|World Teacher]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Lutyens|Lutyens, Mary]] (1975). ''[[Krishnamurti: The Years of Awakening]]''. NewYork: [[Farrar Straus and Giroux]]. Hardcover. pp. 20–21. {{ISBN|0-374-18222-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "discovery" and its objective received widespread publicity and attracted worldwide following, mainly among theosophists. It also started years of upheaval, and contributed to splits in the Theosophical Society and doctrinal schisms in theosophy. Following the discovery, Jiddu Krishnamurti and his younger brother Nityananda ("Nitya") were placed under the care of theosophists and Krishnamurti was extensively groomed for his future mission as the new vehicle for the "World Teacher". Besant soon became the boys' [[legal guardianship|legal guardian]] with the consent of their father, who was very poor and could not take care of them. However, his father later changed his mind and began a legal battle to regain the guardianship, against the will of the boys.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in their relationship, Krishnamurti and Besant had developed a very close bond and he considered her a surrogate mother – a role she happily accepted. (His biological mother had died when he was ten years old).&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens p. 5. Also in p. 31, Krishnamurti's letter to Besant dated 24 December 1909, and in p. 62, letter dated 5 January 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, twenty years after his "discovery", Krishnamurti, who had grown disenchanted with the ''World Teacher Project'', repudiated the role that many theosophists expected him to fulfil. He dissolved the [[Order of the Star in the East]], an organisation founded to assist the World Teacher in his mission, and eventually left the [[Theosophical Society]] and theosophy at large.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens pp. 276–278, 285.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the rest of his life travelling the world as an unaffiliated speaker, becoming in the process widely known as an original, independent thinker on philosophical, psychological, and spiritual subjects. His love for Besant never waned, as also was the case with Besant's feelings towards him;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Lutyens|Lutyens, Mary]] (2003). ''The Life and Death of Krishnamurti''. [[Bramdean]]: [http://www.kfoundation.org.uk/acatalog/ Krishnamurti Foundation Trust]. p. 81. {{ISBN|0-900506-22-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; concerned for his wellbeing after he declared his independence, she had purchased {{convert|6|acre|ha}} of land near the Theosophical Society estate which later became the headquarters of the [[Jiddu Krishnamurti#External links|''Krishnamurti Foundation India '']].

==Home Rule movement==
Along with her theosophical activities, Besant continued to actively participate in political matters. She had joined the [[Indian National Congress]]. As the name suggested, this was originally a debating body, which met each year to consider resolutions on political issues. Mostly it demanded more of a say for middle-class Indians in British Indian government. It had not yet developed into a permanent mass movement with local organisation. About this time her co-worker Leadbeater moved to Sydney.

In 1914 [[World War I]] broke out, and Britain asked for the support of its Empire in the fight against Germany. Echoing an Irish nationalist slogan, Besant declared, "England's need is India's opportunity". As editor of the ''New India'' newspaper, she attacked the [[British Raj|colonial government]] of India and called for clear and decisive moves towards self-rule. As with Ireland, the government refused to discuss any changes while the war lasted.

[[File:Annie Besant.001.jpg|thumb|Annie Besant in Sydney, 1922]]
In 1916 Besant launched the [[All India Home Rule League]] along with [[Lokmanya Tilak]], once again modelling demands for India on Irish nationalist practices. This was the first political party in India to have regime change as its main goal. Unlike the Congress itself, the League worked all year round. It built a structure of local branches, enabling it to mobilise demonstrations, public meetings and agitations. In June 1917 Besant was arrested and interned at a [[hill station]], where she defiantly flew a red and green flag. The Congress and the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] together threatened to launch protests if she were not set free; Besant's arrest had created a focus for protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 192|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government was forced to give way and to make vague but significant concessions. It was announced that the ultimate aim of British rule was Indian self-government, and moves in that direction were promised. Besant was freed in September 1917, welcomed by crowds all over India, and in December she took over as president of the Indian National Congress for a year.

After the war, a new leadership of the Indian National Congress emerged around [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] – one of those who had written to demand Besant's release. He was a lawyer who had returned from leading Asians in a peaceful struggle against racism in South Africa. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], Gandhi's closest collaborator, had been educated by a theosophist tutor.

The new leadership was committed to action that was both militant and non-violent, but there were differences between them and Besant. Despite her past, she was not happy with their socialist leanings. Until the end of her life, however, she continued to campaign for India's independence, not only in India but also on speaking tours of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer S. Uglow, Maggy Hendry, ''The Northeastern Dictionary of Women's Biography'' (Northeastern University, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; In her own version of Indian dress, she remained a striking presence on speakers' platforms. She produced a torrent of letters and articles demanding independence.

==Later years and death==
Besant tried as a person, theosophist, and president of the Theosophical Society, to accommodate Krishnamurti's views into her life, without success; she vowed to personally follow him in his new direction although she apparently had trouble understanding both his motives and his new message.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens pp. 236, 278–280.&lt;/ref&gt; The two remained friends until the end of her life.

In 1931 she became ill in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mrs. Annie Besant, 84, Is Gravely Ill in India.

Besant died on 20 September 1933, at age 85, in Adyar, Madras Presidency, British India. Her body was cremated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Annie Besant Cremated.

She was survived by her daughter, [[Mabel Besant-Scott|Mabel]]. After her death, colleagues [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], [[Aldous Huxley]], Guido Ferrando, and [[Rosalind Rajagopal]], built the Happy Valley School in California, now renamed the [[Besant Hill School of Happy Valley]] in her honour.

==Descendants==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
The subsequent family history became fragmented. A number of Besant's descendants have been traced in detail from her son Arthur Digby's side. Arthur Digby Besant (1869-1960) was President of the Institute of Actuaries, 1924-26. He wrote ''The Besant Pedigree'' (1930) and was director of the Theosophical bookstore in London. One of Arthur Digby's daughters was Sylvia Besant, who married [[Commander]] [[Clem Lewis (Commander)|Clem Lewis]] in the 1920s. They had a daughter, Kathleen Mary, born in 1934, who was given away for [[adoption]] within three weeks of the birth and had the new name of [[Lavinia Pollock]]. Lavinia married Frank Castle in 1953 and raised a family of five of Besant's great-great-grandchildren&amp;nbsp;– James, Richard, David, Fiona and [[Andrew Castle]]&amp;nbsp;– the last and youngest sibling being a former British professional tennis player and now television presenter and personality.

Besant opined that for centuries the leaders of [[Christian philosophy|Christian thought]] spoke of women as a necessary evil, and that the greatest saints of the Church were those who despised women the most, "Against the teachings of eternal torture, of the vicarious atonement, of the infallibility of the Bible, I leveled all the strength of my brain and tongue, and I exposed the history of the Christian Church with unsparing hand, its persecutions, its religious wars, its cruelties, its oppressions. (Annie Besant, An Autobiography Chapter VII)." In the section named "Its Evidences Unreliable" of her work "Christianity", Besant presents the case of why the [[Gospel]]s are not authentic.

'''Ansar-ud-Deen Society of Nigeria''' is a [[Muslim]] organization established for the purpose of the educational development of Muslims and also as a body to enhance the moral and social development of the Muslim community in [[Lagos]].&lt;ref name="Reichmuth"&gt;Stefan Reichmuth. 'New Trends in Islamic Education in Nigeria: A Preliminary Account', Die Welt des Islams, New Ser., Bd. 29, Nr. 1/4, 1989. p 42.&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1923 as a [[non-sectarian]] and non-political educational association, although there are doubts about its non-political stance.&lt;ref&gt;Reichmuth, Education and Growth p 374.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society started out as a response to the advent of a class of Western trained Christian elites in the colonial capital of Lagos and also to engage in the promotion of reformist ideas and development in the Muslim communities of Lagos and later in [[Nigeria]]. The group, however, toed the line that a [[reformist]] [[Islam]] could co-exist with western innovations and ideas.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Andrew Roberts. The Colonial Moment in Africa: Essays on the Movement of Minds and Materials, 1900-1940, Cambridge University Press, 1990. p 219. {{ISBN|0-521-38674-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
By the turn of the twentieth century, an emerging social class of  Christian elites had risen to prominence and were emerging as an authority in political and social affairs in Lagos. This was mostly due to the effort of [[missionaries]] in promoting Western education, which resulted in the creation of many graduates in different professional fields. The new elites also promoted the use of the word Yoruba to promote a unifying social and ethnic group in Southwestern Nigeria; among the new groups was [[Samuel Johnson]], a  pioneering Nigerian historian. The group emerged at a time the [[communal]] towns and cities of [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western Nigeria]] were being inundated by the imperial interest of Great Britain. They then decided to carve out ways to maintain and enhance the social and cultural development in modern [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] states as a response to the imperial interests of Great Britain. However, in reality, many of the new elites were cooperative with the British mission to unite Nigerian communities.

The role and effect on the Lagos Muslim community of the movement towards [[hegemony]] was thought of as good a political and social route. Thus a notion of tolerance among Muslims with other groups in Lagos was accepted, resulting in a polarizing and diverse communal society as promoted by the new elite. However, an awareness of emerging conflicts between Christian elites and the colonial government especially in Lagos and the role Western education played in the emergence of the elites led many Muslims to devise means of educating their communities. These reformist groups were associated with elemental Yoruba organizations called, Egbe ([[professional association]]s) and were also influenced by different factors and movements in the Muslim community such as the [[Ahmadiyya]] movement in Lagos and itinerant [[Arabic]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Reichmuth, Education and Growth p 366-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Ansar Ud Deen==
In 1923, when the Ansar Ud Deen society was formed, it was originally called Young Ansar Ud Deen and started out in Lagos, a [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] trading and coastal center with foreign and local traders converging to trade goods. Many members of the Lagos Muslim community were integral individuals in the Lagos trading community and had been exposed to the international and [[empire|imperial]] trading groups and non trading ideas they brought along. The Muslim community initially flourished in the [[immigrant|migrant]] communities of the [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Nupe people|Nupe]] and [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] ethnic groups and also a permission granted in 1841, which allowed public prayers.&lt;ref&gt;Reichmuth, Education and Growth, p 368&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in 1908, a dispute emerged in the Lagos Muslim community in reaction to a new water rate effected by the colonial administrators. The majority of the community opposed the rate while the Chief Imam supported the government move. Among many of the young elites who founded Ansar Ud Deen were members who supported the Chief Imam; some were also individuals who left the Ahmadiyya movement in Lagos.  A new group of young educated Muslims, who were largely from the factions that supported the Chief [[Imam]] in Lagos, was made up of members of a Juvenile Muslim Society.  Both were united in finding ways to stem a drift in the community and, importantly, to fund Muslim schools along the lines of western education in Lagos. A series of meetings were held in November and December 1924 to discuss on the aforementioned issues and to form an association. On 21 December 1924, the Young Ansar Ud Deen was formed and led by a committee of 42 gentlemen. A number of its original members were associated with [[Liberated Africans in Nigeria|Saros]] in Lagos, bearing names such as Savage, Carew and Williams. Prominent members of the society were Y.k. Gbajabiamila, Hussein Carew, M.A. Okunnu, Hafiz Abu and Yesufu Tairu.&lt;ref&gt;Reichmuth, Education and Growth p 370-375.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social structure==

===Governing structure===
The new [[Professional association|association]] and the committee of 42 [[gentlemen]] designed an executive body headed by the president and supported by a vice president to partake in the governing affairs of the society, and by 1926, a [[constitution]] was enacted to establish rules of conduct. In 1927, the society became officially recognized as a non-governmental association and opened its doors to all members of the Muslim society both men and women. However, in its early years, the activities of the group showed similarities with the improvement unions and missionary societies already existent in [[Yorubaland]]. The society's theme of propagation of Islam through translation of Islamic works and the promotion of literary and intellectual pursuit among members and in the general Muslim community was similar to the scholarly ideals of many egbe (professional associations) in the region.

===Missionary body===
In 1926, the society initiated a mission board which had two prominent members, [[Mustafa Ekemode]] (who later became the Chief Imam and head of mission) and [[M.A. Okunnu]]. The board was tasked with organizing religious related activities such as open-air [[praying]], celebration of important Islamic dates, child naming ceremonies and fund raising activities. In the case of its social related activities, such as marriages and child naming ceremonies, the group introduced modern approaches to the events.&lt;ref&gt;Reichmuth, Education and Growth p 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1940s, the group had expanded into other Yoruba towns and cities and an emerging issue of coordinating the expansion arose. Mustafa Ekemode was called on to be the chief missioner with a salary paid by the society. He was the society's first salaried member.  In the early 1940s, the group gradually withdrew from meetings and prayers at the Lagos Central Mosque, and started its own Friday prayers near its own school. However, in 1954, the grouped fused itself with several committees of the Central [[Mosque]] on discussion of some major dates of the [[Islamic calendar]]. By then, the group had emerged as a wholly independent religious authority within the Lagos and Islamic Muslim community. In 1955, Ekemode joined the [[Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria|Broadcasting Corporation of Nigeria]], and was involved with producing and presenting radio programs while talking on the radio with a distinctive style in [[Quranic]] recitations. The style was admired by many Yorubas at the time.

===The Role of women===
In its early years, women played major factors in the financial solvency of the society and their contributions was noted by the association in its first published newsletter in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Reichmuth, Education and Growth p 379.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ansar Ud Deen society also introduced liberating rules on the role of women in the community and rejected the seclusion of women. Though, the most active women members were wives of officers of the society, the women's wing attracted wealthy women financiers, some of whom built Mosques and schools for the society.

===Education mission===
The society, whose principal mission was promoting the intellectual pursuits of young children of Muslim parents, opened its first [[Primary School|primary school]] in Alakoro in 1931.  An education board was created in 1933-1934 to govern the educational programs of the society and to manage the new school. In the 1930s, the primary school consumed most of the society's financial capital but this did not deter further expansion. In 1942, a ten-year educational plan was initiated which resolved to establish more primary schools, a [[secondary school]] for boys and girls and a teachers training institute. The schools were to emphasize the teaching of Western subjects, though they were also influenced by Arabic teachings, as a prominent pioneer teacher was Arab and Arabic language was an important subject. The teachers training institute opened in 1946, with a large number of Christian teachers and Muslim students from other Yoruba towns and cities. By this time, the society had started expanding to other Yoruba cities through its own effort and cooperation with local Muslim groups, many of whom had seen the relative effectiveness of the Ansar Ud Deen project and wanted a learned hand in the running of schools in their locales. By 1955, the school was coordinating the education affairs of 80 primary schools in the country. The Society's most significant success was its cooperation with the Western Government of Nigeria's Universal Primary Education initiative in 1955. The government's plan envisaged building schools to be operated by voluntary associations, and brought in Ansar Ud deen to run most of the educational concessions given to the Muslim Voluntary Agencies.

In the 1960s, the society participated in the formation of modern Secondary and Grammar schools and, according to research samples, in 1964, close to 30% of Yoruba Muslims were involved with the Ansar Ud Deen Society and about 43% of children Yoruba Muslims  attended schools run by Islamic Voluntary agencies.

However, by the mid-1970s, the Federal Government of the [[Federal Republic of Nigeria]] took control of schools run by voluntary associations, including those run by Ansar Ud Deen.

==Influence in Yoruba land==
The success of the society's educational programs and its championing of Islamic reform in Nigeria caught the attention of many Yoruba leaders and communal associations. Egbes, or organized associations, of Muslims in a few towns like [[Ofa Kugbe|Ofa]] worked with the society in the establishment of primary schools. These projects were usually started as a result of a members' knowledge of the activities of the society in Lagos and brought the society's activities to the knowledge of other professional associates. In [[Ibadan]], the society grew through the effort of the Baale Alesinloye, who introduced and brought the society to Ibadan. Originally, the society faced stiff opposition from the Ibadan Central Mosque authorities,  but with the establishment of a school in 1951, the acceptance of the society grew. By then it had a notable member in the person of Humani Alaga, a prominent market women leader.&lt;ref name="Reichmuth, Education and Growth"&gt;Stefan Reichmuth. 'Education and the Growth of Religious Associations among Yoruba Muslims: The Ansar-Ud-Deen Society of Nigeria', Journal of Religion in Africa  &gt;   Vol. 26, Fasc. 4  (Nov., 1996), pp. 365-405.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many associations, such as the Young Nawair Ud Deen which sprang from the Muslim community in [[Abeokuta]], later followed the policies of the Ansar Ud Deen in its policy of educational expansion.

'''Anthony "Tony" de Mello''' (4 September 1931&amp;nbsp;– 2 June 1987) was an [[Indian people|Indian]] [[Jesuit]] [[Catholic priesthood|priest]] and [[psychotherapist]].  A spiritual teacher, writer, and [[public speaker]], De Mello wrote several books on [[spirituality]] and hosted numerous [[spiritual retreat]]s and conferences. He continues to be known for his [[storytelling]] which drew from the various [[mysticism|mystical]] traditions of both [[Eastern philosophy|East]] and [[Western philosophy|West]] and for his introducing many people in the West to awareness prayer.

== Beginnings ==
De Mello was the oldest of five children born to Frank and Louisa née Castellino de Mello. He was born in [[Bombay]], [[British Raj|British India]], on 4 September 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4qCXtwqa1gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=anthony+de+mello+the+happy+wanderer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VxYqU4-hDYS9qgGWwYG4AQ&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20early%20years&amp;f=false | title=Anthony Demello SJ: The Happy Wanderer | publisher=[[Orbis Books]] | author=de Mello, Bill | year=2013 | page=8 | isbn=978-1-62698-020-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was raised in a Catholic family and dreamed of one day joining the Jesuit order.  

At the age of 16, he entered the [[Society of Jesus]] in the seminary of Vinalaya on the outskirts of Bombay. In 1952, de Mello was sent to Spain to study philosophy in Barcelona before undertaking ministry. He then returned to India to study theology at De Nobili College in Pune, and was ordained into the priesthood in March 1961. After his return to India, he spent several years working in seminaries, and in 1968 he was made rector of the seminary of Vinalaya.&lt;ref name="teachers"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tbYHJFej2UC&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=anthony+de+mello+ordained+as+priest&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ORIrU6HJBInwqQGLn4CYCw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=anthony%20de%20mello%20ordained%20as%20priest&amp;f=false|title=Teachers of Wisdom|author=Kononenko, Igor|publisher=[[Dorrance Publishing Co.|Dorrance Publishing]]|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4349-5410-7|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jesuit.ie/who-are-the-jesuits/inspirational-jesuits/anthony-de-mello/|title=Anthony de Mello - Jesuits Ireland|date=2017-05-31|work=Jesuits Ireland|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

De Mello was first attracted to the Jesuits for their strict discipline. Those who knew him during his earlier years in the order described him as somewhat conservative in his theology and reluctant to explore other religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cta-usa.org/conf2001talks.html#nazareth|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221145640/http://www.cta-usa.org/conf2001talks.html#nazareth|archivedate=2009-02-21|title=Here and Now with Anthony De Mello|author=Nazareth, Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his peers noted that his experience in Spain led him to broaden his perspective and to lose much of his rigidity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Work ==
In 1972, he founded the Institute of Pastoral Counselling, later renamed the Sadhana Institute of Pastoral Counseling, in [[Poona, India]].&lt;ref name="teachers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZReDL_16NAMC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;dq=anthony+de+mello+Institute+of+pastoral+counselling+sadhana+institute&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=khkrU4CSJ8HHrQHXpICABQ&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=anthony%20de%20mello%20Institute%20of%20pastoral%20counselling%20sadhana%20institute&amp;f=false|title=Handbook of Spirituality for Ministers, Volume 1|author=[[Robert J.

De Mello's first published book, ''Sadhana – A Way to God'', was released in 1978. It outlined a number of spiritual principles and "Christian exercises in [[eastern philosophy|Eastern]] form" inspired by the teachings of [[Ignatius of Loyola|Saint Ignatius]].&lt;ref name="America Magazine"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/content/all-things/anthony-de-mello-be-aware-be-alive-be-love|title=Anthony De Mello: Be Aware!

(editor) | year=2008 | page=113 | isbn=978-0-8294-2723-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Awareness prayer differs from [[centering prayer]] more in its method than its purpose: instead of focusing on a word, awareness prayer attends to a sensation, like our pulse or breathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/39370/sadhana-by-anthony-de-mello/9780385196147/|title=Sadhana by Anthony De Mello {{!}} PenguinRandomHouse.com|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other books published during DeMello's lifetime include ''The Song of the Bird'', ''One Minute Wisdom'' and ''Wellsprings''. The first two were collections of stories and the last a collection of exercises similar to ''Sadhana''.

He became renowned worldwide for his books and talks, which help people to be more aware, more in touch with their body, sensations, and the gift that life is to them. Thousands attended his lecture-conferences, as at [[St. Louis University]] each summer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://demellospirituality.com/keypeople/anthony-de-mello.html|title=De Mello Spirituality {{!}} Anthony de Mello|website=demellospirituality.com|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he would say: "Let the Spirit work. Stop straining your spiritual muscles. Become attuned to your deeper self and let the force of life take over. Let the Holy Spirit take over."&lt;ref name="America Magazine"/&gt;

De Mello died suddenly of a [[heart attack]] in 1987, aged 55, in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.tpg.com.au/adsligol/tony/tony1.html Biography, by Bill deMello] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324014959/http://users.tpg.com.au/adsligol/tony/tony1.html |date=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, 11 years after de Mello's death, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] under the leadership of its Cardinal-Prefect, [[Joseph Ratzinger]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=02/12/2013 12:31 pm EST |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-j-reid-jr/the-last-20th-century-pope_b_2669582.html |title=The Last 20th-Century Pope &amp;#124; Charles J. Reid, Jr |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (who later became Pope Benedict XVI) conducted a review of de Mello's work and released a lengthy comment expressing appreciation but also theological concern that, while there was no explicit heresy, some might be misled into seeing Jesus not as the Son of God but as simply one who came to teach that all are children of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19980624_demello_en.html|author=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith |authorlink=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith |title=Notification Concerning the Writings of Fr.

Though some form of immersion was likely the most common method of baptism, many of the writings from the ancient church appeared to view the mode of baptism as inconsequential. The Didache 7.1–3 (AD 60–150) allowed for affusion practices in situations where immersion was not practical. Likewise, Tertullian (AD 196–212) allowed for varying approaches to baptism even if those practices did not conform to biblical or traditional mandates (cf. De corona militis 3; De baptismo 17). Finally, Cyprian (ca. AD 256) explicitly stated that the amount of water was inconsequential and defended immersion, affusion, and aspersion practices (Epistle 75.12). As a result, there was no uniform or consistent mode of baptism in the ancient church prior to the fourth century.&lt;ref&gt;Slade, Darren M. (August 2014).

==Mode and manner==

Baptism is practiced in several different ways. [[Aspersion]] is the sprinkling of water on the head, and [[affusion]] is the pouring of water over the head.

The word "[[immersion baptism|immersion]]" is derived from [[late Latin]] ''immersio'', a noun derived from the verb ''immergere'' (''in'' – "into" + ''mergere'' "dip"). In relation to baptism, some use it to refer to any form of dipping, whether the body is put completely under water or is only partly dipped in water; they thus speak of immersion as being either total or partial. Others, of the Anabaptist belief, use "immersion" to mean exclusively plunging someone entirely under the surface of the water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=immersion Online Etymology Dictionary].

The word submersion comes from the [[late Latin]] (''sub-'' "under, below" + ''mergere'' "plunge, dip")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/submerge Submerge – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]. Merriam-webster.com (April 25, 2007). Retrieved on August 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and is also sometimes called "complete immersion". It is the form of baptism in which the water completely covers the candidate's body. Submersion is practiced in the Orthodox and several other Eastern Churches.&lt;ref&gt;It is not the only method that these churches use: "In the present practice of infant baptism in the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek church]] the priest holds the child as far under the water as possible and scoops water over the head so as to be fully covered with water" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=xC9GAdUGX5sC&amp;pg=PA894&amp;dq=baptism+priest+%22head%22+%22so+as+to%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=g4fzTJfpM82FhQedjuylCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=baptism%20priest%20%22head%22%20%22so%20as%20to%22&amp;f=false Everett Ferguson, ''Baptism in the Early Church'', p. 860]).&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Latin Church]] of the Catholic Church, baptism by submersion is used in the [[Ambrosian Rite]] and is one of the methods provided in the [[Roman Rite]] of the baptism of infants. It is seen as obligatory among some groups that have arisen since the [[Protestant Reformation]], such as [[Baptists]]

===Meaning of the Greek verb ''baptizein''===
The [[Greek-English Lexicon]] of Liddell and Scott gives the primary meaning of the verb ''baptizein'', from which the English verb "baptize" is derived, as "dip, plunge", and gives examples of plunging a sword into a throat or an embryo and for drawing wine by dipping a cup in the bowl; for New Testament usage it gives two meanings: "baptize", with which it associates the [[Septuagint]] mention of [[Naaman]] dipping himself in the [[Jordan River]], and "perform ablutions", as in Luke 11:38.&lt;ref name="LSJ"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=bapti/zw Liddell &amp; Scott: entry βαπτίζω]: "βαπτ-ίζω, A. dip, plunge, 'ξίφος εἰς σφαγήν' J.BJ2.18.4; 'σπάθιον εἰς τὸ ἔμβρυον' Sor.2.63:—Pass., of a [[trepanning|trephine]], Gal.10.447; ... 2. draw wine by dipping the cup in the bowl, Aristopho 14.5; 'φιάλαις β. ἐκ . . κρατήρων' ..." The usage examples quoted here mean "a sword into his throat"; "a sword into the foetus"; "draw with cups from bowls"&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Greek verb ''baptizein'' does not exclusively mean dip, plunge or immerse (it is used with literal and figurative meanings such as "sink", "disable", "overwhelm", "go under", "overborne", "draw from a bowl"),&lt;ref name=LSJ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theological dictionary of the New Testament. 1964–c1976.

In the latter case, however, πλύνω (כבס) and λούομαι (רחץ) are more common, as in Lv. 15:11, 13 etc. The sevenfold dipping of Naaman (2 K. 5:14) perhaps suggests sacramental ideas and illustrates the importance of the Jordan.

"While it is true that the basic root meaning of the Greek words for baptize and baptism is immerse/immersion, it is not true that the words can simply be reduced to this meaning, as can be seen from Mark 10:38–39, Luke 12:50, Matthew  3:11 Luke 3:16 and Corinthians10:2."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncqkZnDSeo4C&amp;pg=PA101 |editor-first=William A. |editor-last=Dyrness |title=Global Dictionary of Theology |publisher=Intervarsity Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8308-2454-0 |page=101 |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two passages in the [[Gospel]]s indicate that the verb ''baptizein'' did not always indicate submersion. The first is Luke 11:38, which tells how a Pharisee, at whose house Jesus ate, "was astonished to see that he did not first wash (''ἐβαπτίσθη'', aorist passive of ''βαπτίζω''—literally, "was baptized") before dinner". This is the passage that Liddell and Scott cites as an instance of the use of ''{{lang|grc|βαπτίζω}}'' to mean ''perform ablutions''. Jesus' omission of this action is similar to that of his disciples: "Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash (''{{lang|grc|νίπτω}}'') not their hands when they eat bread".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Mt|15:1–2|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other Gospel passage pointed to is: "The Pharisees...do not eat unless they wash (''{{lang|grc|νίπτω}}'', the ordinary word for washing) their hands thoroughly, observing the tradition of the elders; and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they wash themselves (literally, "baptize themselves"—''βαπτίσωνται'', passive or middle voice of ''βαπτίζω'')".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Mk|7:3–4|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metaphorical uses of the term in the NT appear to take this for granted, e.g. the prophecy that the Messiah will baptise in Spirit and fire as a liquid (Matt. 3:11), the "baptism" of the Israelites in the cloud and the sea (1 Cor. 10:2), and in the idea of Jesus' death as a baptism (Mk. 10:38f. baptisma; Lk. 12:50; cf.

[[File:Baptism - Marcellinus and Peter.jpg|thumb|left|Fresco of a baptism from the [[Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter]].]]
A possible additional use of the verb ''baptizein'' to relate to ritual washing is suggested by [[Peter Leithart]] (2007) who suggests that Paul's phrase "Else what shall they do who are [[baptism for the dead|baptized for the dead]]?"&lt;ref&gt;οἱ βαπτιζόμενοι ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρῶν&lt;/ref&gt; relates to Jewish ritual washing.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Leithart ''The Baptized Body'' 2007 p136 "Paul uses a distancing third person—"they" baptize for the dead. Why not "we"? Paul might well be referring to Jewish practices. Under the ceremonial laws of Torah, every washing was a washing "for the dead" (cf. Num. 19). Uncleanness was a ceremonial form of death, and through washings of various sorts the unclean dead were restored to life in fellowship with.."&lt;/ref&gt; In Jewish Greek the verb ''baptizein'' "baptized" has a wider reference than just "baptism" and in Jewish context primarily applies to the masculine noun ''baptismos'' "ritual washing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G909&amp;t=KJV |title=masculine noun baptismos 4x NT uses |publisher=Blueletterbible.org |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verb ''baptizein'' occurs four times in the Septuagint in the context of ritual washing, ''baptismos''; Judith cleansing herself from menstrual impurity, [[Naaman]] washing seven times to be cleansed from leprosy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Wolff ''Baptism: The Covenant and the Family'' 2009 p45 "This word occurs but four times in the Septuagint, and in no case with the Baptist meaning. 1st. "Judith baptized herself in a fountain of water, by the camp." (Judith xii. 7.) She was then purifying herself from her uncleanness."&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the New Testament only, the verb ''baptizein'' can also relate to the neuter noun ''baptisma'' "baptism" which is a [[neologism]] unknown in the [[Septuagint]] and other pre-Christian Jewish texts.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan David Lawrence ''Washing in Water: Trajectories of Ritual Bathing in the Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Literature'' (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2006), p294&lt;/ref&gt; This broadness in the meaning of ''baptizein'' is reflected in English Bibles rendering "wash", where Jewish ritual washing is meant: for example Mark 7:4 states that the Pharisees "except they wash (Greek "baptize"), they do not eat",&lt;ref&gt;ἐὰν μὴ βαπτίσωνται οὐκ ἐσθίουσιν&lt;/ref&gt; and "baptize" where ''baptisma'', the new Christian rite, is intended.

===Derived nouns===
Two nouns derived from the verb ''baptizo'' (βαπτίζω) appear in the New Testament: the masculine noun ''baptismos'' (βαπτισμός) and the neuter noun ''baptisma'' (βάπτισμα):

*''baptismos'' (βαπτισμός) refers in Mark| 7:4 to a water-rite for the purpose of purification, washing, cleansing, of dishes;&lt;ref name=Arndt&gt;Arndt, W., Danker, F. W., &amp; Bauer, W. (2000).

Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Hebrews 6:2 perhaps also to baptism, though there it may possibly refer to washing an inanimate object.&lt;ref name="Friberg"&gt;Friberg, T., Friberg, B., &amp; Miller, N. F. (2000). Vol. 4: Analytical Lexicon of the Greek New Testament. Baker's Greek New Testament Library (87). Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Books.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Spiros Zodhiates]] when referring merely to the cleansing of utensils ''baptismos'' (βαπτισμός) is equated with ''rhantismos'' (ῥαντισμός, [[aspersion|"sprinkling"]]), found only in Hebrews 12:24 and Peter 1:2, a noun used to indicate the symbolic cleansing by the Old Testament priest.&lt;ref name=Zodhiates/&gt;
*''baptisma'' (βάπτισμα), which is a [[neologism]] appearing to originate in the New Testament, and probably should not be confused with the earlier Jewish concept of ''baptismos'' (βαπτισμός),&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Zodhiates, S.

*Manuscript variation: In Colossians, some manuscripts have neuter noun ''baptisma'' (βάπτισμα), but some have masculine noun ''baptismos'' (βαπτισμός), and this is the reading given in modern critical editions of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.bibelwissenschaft.de/online-bibeln/novum-testamentum-graece-na-27/lesen-im-bibeltext/bibelstelle/Kol%202/cache/d3cb350c68/#v12 [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-Aland]] 27th (latest) edition.&lt;/ref&gt; If this reading is correct, then this is the only New Testament instance in which ''baptismos'' (βαπτισμός) is clearly used of Christian baptism, rather than of a generic washing, unless the opinion of some is correct that Hebrews 6:2 may also refer to Christian baptism.&lt;ref name="Friberg"/&gt;
*The feminine noun ''baptisis'',&lt;ref&gt;[[LSJ]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ba%2Fptisin&amp;la=greek&amp;prior=th\n#Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=ba/ptisis-contents baptisis]&lt;/ref&gt; along with the masculine noun ''baptismos''&lt;ref&gt;[[LSJ]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbaptismo%2Fs baptismos]&lt;/ref&gt; both occur in Josephus' Antiquities (J.

G. Dunn ''Jesus remembered'' 2003 p256&lt;/ref&gt;

A Christian baptism is administered in one of the following forms, performing the action either once or thrice:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z47zgZ75dqgC&amp;pg=PA562 |first1=Erwin |last1=Fahlbusch |first2=Geoffrey William |last2=Bromiley |first3=David B. |last3=Barrett |title=The encyclopedia of Christianity |publisher=Wm.

===Apparel===
Until the [[Middle Ages]], most baptisms were performed with the candidates naked—as is evidenced by most of the early portrayals of baptism (some of which are shown in this article), and the early Church Fathers and other Christian writers. Deaconesses helped female candidates for reasons of modesty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/aroseby.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical of these is [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] who wrote "On the Mysteries of Baptism" in the 4th century (c. 350&amp;nbsp;AD):

{{quotation|Do you not know, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into His death? etc....for you are not under the Law, but under grace.

1. Therefore, I shall necessarily lay before you the sequel of yesterday's Lecture, that you may learn of what those things, which were done by you in the inner chamber, were symbolic.

2. As soon, then, as you entered, you put off your tunic; and this was an image of putting off the old man with his deeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2c|Col|3:9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having stripped yourselves, you were naked; in this also imitating Christ, who was stripped naked on the Cross, and by His nakedness put off from Himself the principalities and powers, and openly triumphed over them on the tree. For since the adverse powers made their lair in your members, you may no longer wear that old garment; I do not at all mean this visible one, but the old man, which waxes corrupt in the lusts of deceit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2c|Eph|4:22}}&lt;/ref&gt; May the soul which has once put him off, never again put him on, but say with the Spouse of Christ in the Song of Songs, I have put off my garment, how shall I put it on?&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2c|SongofS|5:3|| Song of Sol 5:3}}&lt;/ref&gt; O wondrous thing! You were naked in the sight of all, and were not ashamed; for truly ye bore the likeness of the first-formed Adam, who was naked in the garden, and was not ashamed.

3. Then, when you were stripped, you were anointed with exorcised oil, from the very hairs of your head to your feet, and were made partakers of the good olive-tree, Jesus Christ.

4. After these things, you were led to the holy pool of Divine Baptism, as Christ was carried from the Cross to the Sepulchre which is before our eyes. And each of you was asked, whether he believed in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and you made that saving confession, and descended three times into the water, and ascended again; here also hinting by a symbol at the three days burial of Christ.... And at the self-same moment you were both dying and being born;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril of Jerusalem, Catechetical Lecture 20 (On the Mysteries. II. of Baptism) {{Bibleref2|Romans|6:3–14}} http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310120.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The symbolism is threefold:

1. Baptism is considered to be a form of rebirth—"by water and the Spirit"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2c|Jn|3:5}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the nakedness of baptism (the second birth) paralleled the condition of one's original birth. For example, St. John Chrysostom calls the baptism "λοχείαν", i.e., giving birth, and "new way of creation...from water and Spirit" ("to John" speech 25,2), and later elaborates:

: {{Quote|For nothing perceivable was handed over to us by Jesus; but with perceivable things, all of them however conceivable. This is also the way with the baptism; the gift of the water is done with a perceivable thing, but the things being conducted, i.e., the rebirth and renovation, are conceivable. For, if you were without a body, He would hand over these bodiless gifts as naked [gifts] to you. But because the soul is closely linked to the body, He hands over the perceivable ones to you with conceivable things. (Chrysostom to Matthew., speech 82, 4, c. 390&amp;nbsp;A.D.)}}

2. The removal of clothing represented the "image of putting off the old man with his deeds" (as per Cyril, above), so the stripping of the body before for baptism represented taking off the trappings of sinful self, so that the "new man", which is given by Jesus, can be put on.
[[File:Rosa Hagström &amp; Lars Ridderstedt II 1948.jpg|thumb|Long laced gown worn at a typical Lutheran baptism in Sweden in 1948]]
3. As St. Cyril again asserts above, as Adam and Eve in scripture were naked, innocent and unashamed in the Garden of Eden, nakedness during baptism was seen as a renewal of that innocence and state of original sinlessness. Other parallels can also be drawn, such as between the exposed condition of Christ during His crucifixion, and the crucifixion of the "old man" of the repentant sinner in preparation for baptism.

Changing customs and concerns regarding modesty probably contributed to the practice of permitting or requiring the baptismal candidate to either retain their undergarments (as in many Renaissance paintings of baptism such as those by da Vinci, Tintoretto, Van Scorel, Masaccio, de Wit and others) or to wear, as is almost universally the practice today, baptismal robes. These robes are most often white, symbolizing purity. Some groups today allow any suitable clothes to be worn, such as trousers and a T-shirt—practical considerations include how easily the clothes will dry (denim is discouraged), and whether they will become see-through when wet.

==Meaning and effects==
[[File:Baptême Cathédrale de Troyes 290308.jpg|thumb|Baptism of [[Augustine of Hippo]] as represented in a sculptural group in [[Troyes]] cathedral (1549)]]
There are differences in views about the effect of baptism for a Christian. Some Christian groups assert baptism is a requirement for salvation and a [[sacrament]], and speak of "[[baptismal regeneration]]". Its importance is related to their interpretation of the meaning of the "Mystical Body of Christ" as found in the New Testament. This view is shared by the Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] denominations, and by Churches formed early during the [[Protestant Reformation]] such as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]. For example, [[Martin Luther]] said:

{{Quote|To put it most simply, the power, effect, benefit, fruit, and purpose of Baptism is to save. No one is baptized in order to become a prince, but as the words say, to "be saved". To be saved, we know, is nothing else than to be delivered from sin, death, and the devil and to enter into the kingdom of Christ and live with him forever.|''[[Luther's Large Catechism]]'', 1529}}

The [[Churches of Christ]],"&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism" /&gt;{{rp|p.66}}&lt;ref name="Theology Matters"/&gt;{{rp|p.112}} [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Christadelphians]], and [[LDS Church]] also espouse baptism as necessary for salvation.

For Roman Catholics, baptism by water is a sacrament of initiation into the life of the children of God (''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', 1212–13). It configures the person to Christ (CCC 1272), and obliges the Christian to share in the Church's apostolic and missionary activity (CCC 1270). The Catholic holds that there are three types of baptism by which one can be saved: sacramental baptism (with water), baptism of desire (explicit or implicit desire to be part of the Church founded by Jesus Christ), and baptism of blood ([[martyrdom]]). In his encyclical ''[[Mystici corporis Christi]]'' of June 29, 1943, [[Pope Pius XII]] spoke of baptism and profession of the true faith as what makes members of the one true Church, which is the body of Jesus Christ himself, as God the Holy Spirit has taught through the Apostle Paul:
{{Quote|
:'''18'''...''Through the waters of Baptism those who are born into this world dead in sin are not only born again and made members of the Church, but being stamped with a spiritual seal they become able and fit to receive the other Sacraments. ...''
:'''22''' ''Actually only those are to be included as members of the Church who have been baptized and profess the true faith, and who have not been so unfortunate as to separate themselves from the unity of the Body, or been excluded by legitimate authority for grave faults committed. 'For in one spirit' says the Apostle, 'were we all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free.' As therefore in the true Christian community there is only one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one Baptism, so there can be only one faith. And therefore if a man refuse to hear the Church let him be considered—so the Lord commands—as a heathen and a publican. It follows that those who are divided in faith or government cannot be living in the unity of such a Body, nor can they be living the life of its one Divine Spirit.'' |[http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/P12MYSTI.HTM ''Mystici corporis Christi'' (full text in an English translation)]}}

By contrast, [[Anabaptist]] and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Protestants recognize baptism as an outward sign of an inward reality following on an individual believer's experience of forgiving grace. [[Reformed]] and [[Methodist]] Protestants maintain a link between baptism and regeneration, but insist that it is not automatic or mechanical, and that regeneration may occur at a different time than baptism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Faith of the Christian Church|last=Inbody|first=Tyron|year=2005|url=https://www.questia.com/read/119924426/the-faith-of-the-christian-church-an-introduction|publisher=William B. Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, MI|page=299}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Churches of Christ]] consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God "by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism" /&gt;{{rp|p.66}} Thus, they see baptism as a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it "is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God".&lt;ref name="Theology Matters"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Harold |last1=Hazelip |first2=Gary |last2=Holloway |first3=Randall J. |last3=Harris |first4=Mark C. |last4=Black |title=Theology Matters: In Honor of Harold Hazelip: Answers for the Church Today |publisher=College Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-89900-813-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.112}}

This particular font was expanded in 2005 to include a small pool to provide for immersion baptism of adults. Eight-sided font architectures are common symbology of the day of Christ's Resurrection: the "Eighth Day".]]
The [[liturgy]] of baptism for Catholics, [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], and [[Methodism|Methodist]] makes clear reference to baptism as not only a symbolic burial and resurrection, but an actual supernatural transformation, one that draws parallels to the experience of [[Noah]] and the passage of the [[Israelites]] through the [[Red Sea]] divided by [[Moses]]. Thus, baptism is literally and symbolically not only cleansing, but also dying and rising again with Christ. Catholics believe baptism is necessary to cleanse the taint of [[original sin]], and so commonly baptise infants. The Eastern Churches ([[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]) also baptize infants on the basis of texts, such as Matthew 19:14, which are interpreted as supporting full Church membership for children. In these denominations, baptism is immediately followed by [[Chrismation]] and [[Eucharist|Communion]] at the next [[Divine Liturgy]], regardless of age. Orthodox likewise believe that baptism removes what they call the ancestral sin of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Nicodemos the Hagiorite]] |title=Concerning Thoughts |work=Exomologetarion |url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/exo_thoughts.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglicans believe that Baptism is also the entry into the Church and therefore allows them access to all rights and responsibilities as full members, including the privilege to receive Holy Communion. Most Methodists and Anglicans agree that it also cleanses the taint of what in the West is called original sin, in the East ancestral sin.
[[File:Baptism Jar (Portuguese period).JPG|thumb|Baptism Jar, used in [[Portuguese Ceylon]].]]
Eastern Orthodox Christians usually insist on complete threefold immersion as both a symbol of death and rebirth into Christ, and as a washing away of sin. [[Latin Church]] Catholics generally baptize by affusion (pouring); Eastern Catholics usually by submersion, or at least partial immersion. However, submersion is gaining in popularity within the Latin Catholic Church. In newer church sanctuaries, the baptismal font may be designed to expressly allow for baptism by immersion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baptism and Church Architecture|url=http://www.religiousproductnews.com/articles/2006-November/Feature-Articles/Baptism-and-Church-Architecture-.htm|website=Baptism and Church Architecture|publisher=Religious Product News|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglicans baptize by submersion, immersion, affusion or sprinkling.

According to evidence which can be traced back to at latest about the year 200,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Tertullian]] |editor=[[Philip Schaff]] |title=[[Ante-Nicene Fathers]] |chapter=Of the Persons to Whom, and the Time When, Baptism is to Be Administered |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.vi.iii.xviii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsors or godparents are present at baptism and vow to uphold the Christian education and life of the baptized.

Baptists argue that the Greek word {{lang|grc|βαπτίζω}} originally meant "to immerse". They interpret some Biblical passages concerning baptism as requiring submersion of the body in water. They also state that only submersion reflects the symbolic significance of being "buried" and "raised" with Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|Rom|6:3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baptist Churches baptize in the name of the [[Trinity]]—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. However, they do not believe that baptism is necessary for salvation; but rather that it is an act of Christian obedience.

Some "[[Full Gospel]]" [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] churches such as [[Oneness Pentecostal]]s baptize only in the name of Jesus Christ, citing Peter's preaching baptism in the name of Jesus as their authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2c|Ac|2:38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecumenical statements===
In 1982 the [[World Council of Churches]] published the [[Christian ecumenism|ecumenical]] paper ''[[Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry]]''. The preface of the document states:

{{quotation|Those who know how widely the churches have differed in doctrine and practice on baptism, Eucharist and ministry, will appreciate the importance of the large measure of agreement registered here. Virtually all the confessional traditions are included in the Commission's membership. That theologians of such widely different denominations should be able to speak so harmoniously about baptism, Eucharist and ministry is unprecedented in the modern ecumenical movement.

A 1997 document, ''Becoming a Christian: The Ecumenical Implications of Our Common Baptism'', gave the views of a commission of experts brought together under the aegis of the World Council of Churches. It states:

{{Quote|...according to Acts 2:38, baptisms follow from Peter's preaching baptism in the name of Jesus and lead those baptized to the receiving of Christ's Spirit, the Holy Ghost, and life in the community: "They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c-nb|Ac|2:42|RSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to the distribution of goods to those in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c-nb|Acts|2:45}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Those who heard, who were baptized and entered the community's life, were already made witnesses of and partakers in the promises of God for the last days: the forgiveness of sins through baptism in the name of Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost on all flesh.&lt;ref name="bibleref2c|Ac|2:38"&gt;{{bibleref2c|Ac|2:38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in what may well be a baptismal pattern, [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] testifies that proclamation of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and teaching about new life&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|1Pe|1:3–21||1 Pe 1:3–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; lead to purification and new birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c-nb|1Pe.|1:22–23||1 Pet. 1:22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, is followed by eating and drinking [[Holy Communion|God's food]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c-nb|1Peter|2:2–3||1 Pet. 2:2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; by participation in the life of the community—the royal priesthood, the new temple, the people of God&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c-nb|1Peter|2:4–10||1 Pet. 2:4–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and by further moral formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c-nb|1Peter|2:11ff||1 Pet. 2:11 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 1 Peter the writer sets this baptism in the context of obedience to Christ and sanctification by the Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c-nb|1Peter|1:2||1 Pet. 1:2}}&lt;/ref&gt; So baptism into Christ is seen as baptism into the Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|1Cor|12:13||1 Co 12:13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth gospel Jesus' discourse with [[Nicodemus]] indicates that birth by water and Spirit becomes the gracious means of entry into the place where God rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|Jn|3:5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oikoumene.org/index.php?id=2672 |title=Becoming a Christian: The Ecumenical Implications of Our Common Baptism |publisher=[[World Council of Churches]] |year=1997 |accessdate=May 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509161956/http://www.oikoumene.org/index.php?id=2672 |archivedate=May 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Validity considerations by some churches===
[[File:Окрещённый ребёнок.jpg|thumb|[[Russian Orthodox]] priest greeting an infant and its godparents on the steps of the church at the beginning of the [[Sacred Mystery]] of Baptism.]]

The vast majority of Christian denominations admit the theological idea that baptism is a [[sacrament]], that has actual spiritual, holy and salvific effects.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}{{dubious|date=May 2018}} Certain key criteria must be complied with for it to be valid, i.e., to actually have those effects. If these key criteria are met, violation of some rules regarding baptism, such as varying the authorized rite for the ceremony, renders the baptism illicit (contrary to the church's laws) but still valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Ecumenical Proposal About The Sacraments|last=Bruno|first=Luciano|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the criteria for validity is use of the correct form of words. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that the use of the verb "baptize" is essential.&lt;ref name="cathen" /&gt; Catholics of the [[Latin Church]], Anglicans and Methodists use the form "I baptize you...." Eastern Orthodox and some [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]] use a [[passive voice]] form "The Servant/(Handmaiden) of God is baptized in the name of...." or "This person is baptized by my hands...."{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Use of the [[Trinitarian formula]] "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" is also considered essential; thus these churches do not accept as valid baptisms of non-[[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] churches such as [[Oneness Pentecostals]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Another essential condition is use of water. A baptism in which some liquid that would not usually be called water, such as wine, milk, soup or fruit juice was used would not be considered valid.&lt;ref name=Fanning/&gt;

Another requirement is that the celebrant intends to perform baptism. This requirement entails merely the intention "to do what the Church does",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1256 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; not necessarily to have Christian faith, since it is not the person baptizing, but the Holy Spirit working through the sacrament, who produces the effects of the sacrament. Doubt about the faith of the baptizer is thus no ground for doubt about the validity of the baptism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/DOCTRINE/INTENTIO.TXT |title=On the Intention Required in the Minister of the Sacraments |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conditions expressly do not affect validity—for example, whether submersion, immersion, affusion or aspersion is used. However, if water is sprinkled, there is a danger that the water may not touch the skin of the unbaptized. As has been stated, "it is not sufficient for the water to merely touch the candidate; it must also flow, otherwise there would seem to be no real ablution. At best, such a baptism would be considered doubtful. If the water touches only the hair, the sacrament has probably been validly conferred, though in practice the safer course must be followed. If only the clothes of the person have received the aspersion, the baptism is undoubtedly void."&lt;ref name=Fanning&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm |title=William Fanning, "Baptism" in '&amp;#39;Catholic Encyclopedia'&amp;#39; (New York 1907) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many communions, validity is not affected if a single submersion or pouring is performed rather than a triple, but in Orthodoxy this is controversial.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

According to the Catholic Church, baptism imparts an [[sacramental character|indelible "seal"]] upon the soul of the baptized and therefore a person who has already been baptized cannot be validly baptized again. This teaching was affirmed against the [[Donatist]]s who practiced rebaptism. The grace received in baptism is believed to operate ''ex opere operato'' and is therefore considered valid even if administered in heretical or schismatic groups.&lt;ref name="ODWR"&gt;{{Cite book|first=John |last=Bowker |authorlink=John Bowker (theologian) |title=[[Oxford Dictionary of World Religions|The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |year=1999 |isbn=0-19-866242-4 |oclc=60181672}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition by other denominations===
The [[Catholic]], [[Lutheran]], [[Anglican]], [[Presbyterian]] and [[Methodist]] Churches accept baptism performed by other denominations within this group as valid, subject to certain conditions, including the use of the Trinitarian formula. It is only possible to be baptized once, thus people with valid baptisms from other denominations may not be baptized again upon conversion or transfer. For Roman Catholics, this is affirmed in the [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P2X.HTM Canon Law 864], in which it is written that "[e]very person not yet baptized and only such a person is capable of baptism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P2X.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such people are accepted upon making a profession of faith and, if they have not yet validly received the sacrament/rite of confirmation or chrismation, by being confirmed. Specifically, "Methodist theologians argued that since God never abrogated a covenant made and sealed with proper intentionality, rebaptism was never an option, unless the original baptism had been defective by not having been made in the name of the Trinity."&lt;ref name="CracknellWhite2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cracknell|first1=Kenneth|last2=White|first2=Susan J.|title=An Introduction to World Methodism|date=5 May 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=English|isbn=9780521818490|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases it can be difficult to decide if the original baptism was in fact valid; if there is doubt, [[conditional baptism]] is administered, with a formula on the lines of "If you are not yet baptized, I baptize you...."&lt;ref name="Jr2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jr|first=Charles Yrigoyen|title=T&amp;T Clark Companion to Methodism|date=25 September 2014|publisher=A&amp;C Black|language=English|isbn=9780567290779|page=263|quote=Methdoists historically do not rebaptize unless the ecumenical formula was not used or another major impediment calls into question the adequacy of an earlier rite. When questions arise of a very grevious nature, there is the possibility of conditional baptism using the words 'If you are not already baptized, I baptize you in the name, etc.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2W.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 869]; cf. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JKgZEjvB5cEC New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law By John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J.], pp. 1057–1059.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the still recent past, it was common practice in the Roman Catholic Church to baptize conditionally almost every convert from Protestantism because of a perceived difficulty in judging about the validity in any concrete case. In the case of the major Protestant Churches, agreements involving assurances about the manner in which they administer baptism has ended this practice, which sometimes continues for other groups of Protestants. The Catholic Church has always recognized the validity of baptism in the Churches of [[Eastern Christianity]], but it has explicitly denied the validity of the baptism conferred in the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni_en.html |title=Response of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith |publisher=Vatican.va |date=June 5, 2001 |accessdate=February 25, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090223230027/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni_en.html| archivedate= February 23, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practice in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] for converts from other communions is not uniform. However, generally baptisms performed in the name of the Holy Trinity are accepted by the Orthodox Christian Church. If a convert has not received the sacrament (mysterion) of baptism, he or she must be baptised in the name of the Holy Trinity before they may enter into communion with the Orthodox Church. If he has been baptized in another Christian confession (other than Orthodox Christianity) his previous baptism is considered retroactively filled with grace by [[chrismation]] or, in rare circumstances, [[confession of faith]] alone as long as the baptism was done in the name of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). The exact procedure is dependent on local [[canon law|canons]] and is the subject of some controversy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

[[Oriental Orthodox Church]]es recognise the validity of baptisms performed within the Eastern Orthodox Communion. Some also recognise baptisms performed by Catholic Churches. Any supposed baptism not performed using the Trinitarian formula is considered invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/invalid-baptisms.html|title=Invalid Baptisms|last=User|first=Super|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eyes of the Catholic Church, all Orthodox Churches, Anglican and Lutheran Churches, the baptism conferred by the LDS Church is invalid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni_en.html Declaration] of June 5, 2001 by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]].&lt;/ref&gt; An article published together with the official declaration to that effect gave reasons for that judgment, summed up in the following words: "The Baptism of the Catholic Church and that of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints differ essentially, both for what concerns faith in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in whose name Baptism is conferred, and for what concerns the relationship to Christ who instituted it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ewtn.com/library/Theology/MORMBAP1.HTM |title= The Question Of The Validity Of Baptism Conferred In The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints |publisher= Ewtn.com |date= August 1, 2001 |accessdate= October 27, 2014 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090116055451/http://www.ewtn.com/library/theology/mormbap1.htm |archivedate= January 16, 2009 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LDS Church stresses that baptism must be administered by one having proper authority; consequently, the church does not recognize the baptism of any other church as valid.&lt;ref name = ldsbaptism&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/topics/baptism |title= Gospel Topics: Baptism |website= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141208175257/http://www.lds.org/topics/baptism |archive-date= December 8, 2014 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jehovah's Witnesses do not recognise any other baptism occurring after 1914&lt;ref&gt;"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1959, p. 288, "Thus, when Christ was enthroned as King A.D. 1914 it was not necessary for all true Christians to be rebaptized in recognition of his ruling position."&lt;/ref&gt; as valid,&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovah's Witnesses Endure for His Sovereign Godship", ''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1966, p. 560, "In the decades of restoration since 1919, right-hearted clergymen of various religious sects in different parts of the earth have repentantly accepted the priesthood services of the anointed remnant of Job-like ones by becoming rebaptized and ordained as true ministers of Jehovah."&lt;/ref&gt; as they believe that they are now the one true church of Christ,&lt;ref&gt;"True Christianity Is Flourishing", ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 2004, p. 7 [http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2004161 As retrieved November 3, 2014], "While Christendom's theologians, missionaries, and churchgoers continue to grapple with the gathering storm of controversy in their churches, true Christianity is flourishing worldwide. Indeed, true Christians...invite you to join Jehovah's Witnesses in united Christian worship of the only true God, Jehovah."&lt;/ref&gt; and that the rest of "Christendom" is false religion.&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses— Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', publ Jehovah's Witnesses, "Chapter 31: How Chosen and Led by God", p. 706, "Clearly, when the time of the end began in 1914, none of the churches of Christendom were measuring up to these Bible standards for the one true Christian congregation. What, though, about the Bible Students, as Jehovah's Witnesses were then known?"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Officiator===

There is debate among Christian churches as to who can administer baptism. Some claim that the examples given in the New Testament only show apostles and deacons administering baptism.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Ancient Christian churches interpret this as indicating that baptism should be performed by the clergy except ''in extremis'', i.e., [[emergency baptism|when the one being baptized is in immediate danger of death]]. Then anyone may baptize, provided, in the view of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the person who does the baptizing is a member of that Church, or, in the view of the Catholic Church, that the person, even if not baptized, intends to do what the Church does in administering the rite. Many Protestant churches see no specific prohibition in the biblical examples and permit any believer to baptize another.

In the Roman Catholic Church, [[canon law]] for the [[Latin Church]] lays down that the ordinary minister of baptism is a bishop, priest or deacon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2V.HTM |title=canon 861 §1 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=May 4, 2007 |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its administration is one of the functions "especially entrusted to the [[priest|parish priest]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1T.HTM#18G |title=canon 530 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=May 4, 2007 |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the person to be baptized is at least fourteen years old, that person's baptism is to be referred to the bishop, so that he can decide whether to confer the baptism himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2V.HTM |title=canon 863 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=May 4, 2007 |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If no ordinary minister is available, a [[catechist]] or some other person whom the local [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] has appointed for this purpose may licitly do the baptism; indeed in a case of necessity ''any'' person (irrespective of that person's religion) who has the requisite intention may confer the baptism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2V.HTM |title=canon 861 §2 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=May 4, 2007 |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By "a case of necessity" is meant imminent danger of death because of either illness or an external threat. "The requisite intention" is, at the minimum level, the intention "to do what the Church does" through the rite of baptism.

In the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], a deacon is not considered an ordinary minister. Administration of the sacrament is reserved to the Parish Priest or to another priest to whom he or the local [[ordinary (officer)|hierarch]] grants permission, a permission that can be presumed if in accordance with canon law. However, "in case of necessity, baptism can be administered by a deacon or, in his absence or if he is impeded, by another cleric, a member of an institute of consecrated life, or by any other Christian faithful; even by the mother or father, if another person is not available who knows how to baptize."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/__PIT.HTM |title=Canon 677 |work=[[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]] |year=1990 |accessdate=February 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] is similar to that of the Eastern Catholic Churches. They require the baptizer, even in cases of necessity, to be of their own faith, on the grounds that a person cannot convey what he himself does not possess, in this case membership in the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ware |first=Kallistos |authorlink=Timothy Ware |year=1964 |title=The Orthodox Church |page=285 |location=New York City |publisher=[[Penguin Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin Catholic Church does not insist on this condition, considering that the effect of the sacrament, such as membership of the Church, is not produced by the person who baptizes, but by the Holy Spirit. For the Orthodox, while Baptism ''in extremis'' may be administered by a deacon or any lay-person, if the newly baptized person survives, a priest must still perform the other prayers of the Rite of Baptism, and administer the [[Sacred Mysteries|Mystery]] of [[Chrismation]].

The discipline of [[Anglicanism]] and [[Lutheranism]] is similar to that of the Latin Catholic Church. For [[Methodists]] and many other Protestant denominations, too, the ordinary minister of baptism is a duly ordained or appointed minister of religion.

Newer movements of Protestant [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] churches, particularly non-denominational, allow laypeople to baptize.

In the LDS Church, only a man who has been ordained to the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic priesthood]] holding the priesthood office of [[Priest (Mormonism)|priest]] or higher office in the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] may administer baptism.&lt;ref name="lds.org"&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Priesthood § Aaronic Priesthood |chapter-url= http://www.lds.org/manual/priesthood-and-auxiliary-leaders-guidebook/priesthood |title= Priesthood and Auxiliary Leaders' Guidebook |publisher= LDS Church |year= 2001 |pages= 4–10 |quote= Brethren who hold the Aaronic Priesthood have authority to perform certain priesthood ordinances.

A [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] baptism is performed by a "dedicated male" adherent.&lt;ref name="autogenerated480"&gt;"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1973, page 480, "In connection with baptism, it may also be noted that a baptism may be performed by a dedicated male even though no other human witnesses are present."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The General Priesthood Today", ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1963, page 147, "Because he is a minister, any competent male member is called on to perform funerals, baptisms and weddings, and to conduct the service in annual commemoration of the Lord's death."&lt;/ref&gt; Only in extraordinary circumstances would a "dedicated" baptizer be unbaptized (see section ''[[#Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witnesses]]'').

==Specific Christian groups practicing baptism==

[[File:River baptism in New Bern.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|A river baptism in [[North Carolina]] at the turn of the 20th century. Full-immersion (submersion) baptism continues to be a common practice in many African-American Christian congregations today.]]

[[Anabaptist]]s and [[Baptists]] recognize only [[believer's baptism]] or "adult baptism". Baptism is seen as an act identifying one as having accepted Jesus Christ as savior.

===Anabaptist===
Early Anabaptists were given that name because they re-baptized persons who they felt had not been properly baptized, having received infant baptism, sprinkling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Anabaptist | title = Online Etymological Dictionary | origyear = 2001 | year = 2010 | first = Douglas | last = Harper | contribution = Anabaptist | access-date = August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional form of Anabaptist baptism was pouring or sprinkling, the form commonly used in the West in the early 16th century when they emerged. Since the 18th century immersion and submersion became more widespread. Today all forms of baptism can be found among Anabaptist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Baptism#Mode_and_Ritual Baptism - Mode and Ritual] at [[Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Baptism memorializes the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus.{{bibleref2c|Rom|6}} Baptism does not accomplish anything in itself, but is an outward personal sign or testimony that the person's sins have already been washed away by the blood of Christ's cross.&lt;ref name="London"&gt;''London Baptist Confession of 1644'', XVII. Web: [http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/bc1644.htm London Baptist Confession of 1644.

===Baptist===
For the majority of Baptists, Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2c|Mt|28:19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an act of obedience symbolizing the believer's faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Saviour, the believer's death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus. It is a testimony to the believer's faith in the final resurrection of the dead.&lt;ref name="BFM"&gt;"The Baptist Faith and Message," Southern Baptist Convention. Adopted, June 14, 2000. Accessed July 29, 2009: http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp#vii&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, for a new convert the general practice is that baptism also allows the person to be a registered member of the local Baptist congregation (though some churches have adopted "new members classes" as a mandatory step for congregational membership).

Regarding rebaptism the general rules are:
*baptisms by other than immersion are not recognized as valid and therefore rebaptism by immersion is required; and 
*baptisms by immersion in other denominations may be considered valid if performed after the person having professed faith in Jesus Christ (though among the more conservative groups such as [[Independent Baptists]], rebaptism may be required by the local congregation if performed in a non-Baptist church &amp;ndash; and, in extreme cases, even if performed within a Baptist church that wasn't an Independent Baptist congregation)

More recently, the rise of the [[International Churches of Christ]] has caused some to reexamine the issue.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism" /&gt;{{rp|p.66}}

Churches of Christ consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God "by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism" /&gt;{{rp|p.66}} Baptism is a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it "is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God."&lt;ref name="Theology Matters" /&gt;{{rp|p.112}} While Churches of Christ do not describe baptism as a "sacrament", their view of it can legitimately be described as "sacramental."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism" /&gt;{{rp|p.66}}&lt;ref name="Baptism, Why Wait?" /&gt;{{rp|p.186}} They see the power of baptism coming from God, who chose to use baptism as a vehicle, rather than from the water or the act itself,&lt;ref name="Baptism, Why Wait?" /&gt;{{rp|p.186}} and understand baptism to be an integral part of the conversion process, rather than just a symbol of conversion.&lt;ref name="Baptism, Why Wait?" /&gt;{{rp|p.184}} A recent trend is to emphasize the transformational aspect of baptism: instead of describing it as just a legal requirement or sign of something that happened in the past, it is seen as "the event that places the believer 'into Christ' where God does the ongoing work of transformation."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism" /&gt;{{rp|p.66}} There is a minority that downplays the importance of baptism in order to avoid sectarianism, but the broader trend is to "reexamine the richness of the biblical teaching of baptism and to reinforce its central and essential place in Christianity."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism" /&gt;{{rp|p.66}}

===Reformed Protestantism===
{{Main|Reformed baptismal theology}}

In [[Reformed baptismal theology]], baptism is seen as primarily God's offer of [[union with Christ]] and all his benefits to the baptized.

In Catholic teaching, baptism is stated to be "necessary for salvation by actual reception or at least by desire".&lt;ref name="can849"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2T.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law, canon 849 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=May 4, 2007 |accessdate=February 25, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090115174636/http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2T.HTM| archivedate= January 15, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This teaching is based on Jesus' words in the [[Gospel according to John]]: "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2c|Jn|3:5|RSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; It dates back to the teachings and practices of 1st-century Christians, and the connection between salvation and baptism was not, on the whole, an item of major dispute until [[Huldrych Zwingli]] denied the necessity of baptism, which he saw as merely a sign granting admission to the Christian community.&lt;ref name="cross2005baptism"/&gt; The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that "Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament."&lt;ref name="vatican" /&gt;  The [[Council of Trent]] also states in the ''Decree Concerning Justification'' from session six that baptism is necessary for salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Council of Trent Session 6|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/councils/trent6.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A person who knowingly, willfully and unrepentantly rejects baptism has no hope of salvation. However, if knowledge is absent, "those also can attain to salvation who through no fault of their own do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Church, yet sincerely seek God and moved by grace strive by their deeds to do His will as it is known to them through the dictates of conscience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LUMEN GENTIUM |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |work=Vatican II |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906031754/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |archivedate=September 6, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catechism of the Catholic Church also states: "Since Baptism signifies liberation from sin and from its instigator the devil, one or more [[exorcism]]s are pronounced over the candidate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3J.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1237 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Roman Rite]] of the baptism of a child, the wording of the prayer of exorcism is: "Almighty and ever-living God, you sent your only Son into the world to cast out the power of Satan, spirit of evil, to rescue man from the kingdom of darkness and bring him into the splendour of your kingdom of light. We pray for this child: set him (her) free from original sin, make him (her) a temple of your glory, and send your Holy Spirit to dwell with him (her). Through Christ our Lord."&lt;ref&gt;Rite of Baptism of Children, 86&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Catholic Church by baptism all sins are forgiven, original sin and all personal sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocp.org/what-is-baptism |title=What is Baptism? |publisher=Oregon Catholic Press |accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given once for all, baptism cannot be repeated. Baptism not only purifies from all sins, but also makes the neophyte "a new creature," an adopted son of God, who has become a "partaker of the divine nature," member of Christ and co-heir with him, and a temple of the Holy Spirit. Sanctifying grace, the grace of justification, given by God by baptism, erases the original sin and personal actual sins.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church: THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholics are baptized in water, by submersion, immersion or affusion, in the name (singular) of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&lt;ref&gt;''Ordo initiationis christanae adultorum'', editio typica, Vatican City, Typis polyglottis vaticanis, 1972, pg 92, cf Lateran IV ''De Fide Catholica'', DS 802, cf Florence, ''Decretum pro Armeniis'', DS, 1317.&lt;/ref&gt;—not three gods, but [[Trinity|one God subsisting in three Persons]]. While sharing in the one divine essence, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct, not simply three "masks" or manifestations of one divine being. The faith of the Church and of the individual Christian is based on a relationship with these three "Persons" of the one God. Adults can also be baptized through the [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults]].

It is claimed that [[Pope Stephen I]], [[St. Ambrose]] and [[Pope Nicholas I]] declared that baptisms in the name of "Jesus" only as well as in the name of "Father, Son and Holy Spirit" were valid. The correct interpretation of their words is disputed.&lt;ref name="cathen" /&gt; Current [[canonical law]] requires the Trinitarian formula and water for validity.&lt;ref name="can849" /&gt;

The Church recognizes two equivalents of baptism with water: "baptism of blood" and "[[baptism of desire]]". Baptism of blood is that undergone by unbaptized individuals who are [[martyr]]ed for their faith, while baptism of desire generally applies to [[catechumen]]s who die before they can be baptized. The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes these two forms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Church has always held the firm conviction that those who suffer death for the sake of the faith without having received Baptism are baptized by their death for and with Christ. This ''Baptism of blood'', like the desire for Baptism, brings about the fruits of Baptism without being a sacrament. (1258)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For catechumens who die before their Baptism, their explicit desire to receive it, together with repentance for their sins, and charity, assures them the salvation that they were not able to receive through the sacrament. (1259)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Catholic Church holds that those who are ignorant of Christ's Gospel and of the Church, but who seek the truth and do God's will as they understand it, may be supposed to have an implicit desire for baptism and can be saved: "'Since Christ died for all, and since all men are in fact called to one and the same destiny, which is divine, we must hold that the Holy Spirit offers to all the possibility of being made partakers, in a way known to God, of the Paschal mystery.' Every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved. It may be supposed that such persons would have desired Baptism explicitly if they had known its necessity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P3M.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1260 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for unbaptized infants, the Church is unsure of their fate; "the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P3M.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1261 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that baptism should be performed by complete immersion (submersion) only when an individual is old enough to understand its significance. They believe that water baptism is an outward symbol that a person has made an unconditional dedication through Jesus Christ to do the will of God. They consider baptism to constitute ordination as a minister.&lt;ref&gt;''Jet'' magazine, August 4, 1955, page 26 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xbEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=%22jehovah%27s+witnesses%22 Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prospective candidates for baptism must express their desire to be baptized well in advance of a planned baptismal event, to allow for congregation [[Elder (Christianity)#Jehovah's Witnesses|elders]] to assess their suitability.&lt;ref&gt;''Organized to Do Jehovah's Will'', published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Elders approve candidates for baptism if the candidates are considered to understand what is expected of members of the religion and to demonstrate sincere dedication to the faith.&lt;ref&gt;''Organized to Do Jehovah's Will'', published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most baptisms among Jehovah's Witnesses are performed at scheduled assemblies and conventions by elders and ministerial servants&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', May 15, 1970, page 309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The General Priesthood Today", ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1963, page 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organized to Do Jehovah's Will'', published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 215, "Baptisms are usually performed at assemblies and conventions of Jehovah's Witnesses."&lt;/ref&gt; and rarely occur at local [[Kingdom Hall]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1973, page 480&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to baptism, at the conclusion of a pre-baptism talk, candidates must affirm two questions:&lt;ref&gt;Watchtower June 1, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Baptism in Mormonism}}

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), baptism has the main purpose of remitting the [[sin]]s of the participant. It is followed by [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|confirmation]], which inducts the person into membership in the church and constitutes a [[baptism with the Holy Spirit]]. Latter-day Saints believe that baptism must be by full immersion, and by a precise ritualized ordinance: if some part of the participant is not fully immersed, or the ordinance was not recited verbatim, the ritual must be repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url= http://www.lds.org/manual/duties-and-blessings-of-the-priesthood-basic-manual-for-priesthood-holders-part-b/priesthood-and-church-government/lesson-5-performing-priesthood-ordinances?lang=eng |title= Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood: Basic Manual for Priesthood Holders, Part B |chapter= Performing Priesthood Ordinances § Baptism |year= 2000 |pages= 41–48 |publisher= LDS Church |url= https://www.lds.org/manual/duties-and-blessings-of-the-priesthood-basic-manual-for-priesthood-holders-part-b/priesthood-and-church-government/lesson-5-performing-priesthood-ordinances?lang=eng |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141208180037/https://www.lds.org/manual/duties-and-blessings-of-the-priesthood-basic-manual-for-priesthood-holders-part-b/priesthood-and-church-government/lesson-5-performing-priesthood-ordinances?lang=eng |archive-date= December 8, 2014 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It typically occurs in a [[baptismal font]].

In addition, members of the LDS Church do not believe a baptism is valid unless it is performed by a Latter-day Saint one who has proper authority (a [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priest]] or [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elder]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/baptism-baptize?lang=eng |title= Guide to the Scriptures: Baptism, Baptize § Proper authority |website= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141208180445/https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/baptism-baptize?lang=eng |archive-date= December 8, 2014 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authority is passed down through a form of [[apostolic succession]]. All new converts to the faith must be baptized or [[rebaptism (Mormonism)|re-baptized]]. Baptism is seen as symbolic both of Jesus' death, burial and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/baptism?lang=eng |title= Baptism |work= [[LDS edition of the Bible|KJV (LDS)]]: [[Bible Dictionary (LDS Church)|Bible Dictionary]] |publisher= LDS Church |year= 1979 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141208180641/http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/baptism?lang=eng |archive-date= December 8, 2014 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also symbolic of the baptized individual discarding their "natural" self and donning a new identity as a disciple of Jesus.

According to Latter-day Saint theology, [[faith]] and [[repentance]] are prerequisites to baptism. The ritual does not cleanse the participant of [[original sin]], as Latter-day Saints do not believe the doctrine of original sin. Mormonism rejects [[infant baptism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Mormon]], {{lds|Moroni|moro|8|4|23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoM Infant Baptism"&gt;{{citation |last= Parsons |first= Robert E. |contribution= Infant Baptism: LDS Perspective |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/3795 |page= 682 |editor1-last= Ludlow |editor1-first= Daniel H |editor1-link= Daniel H.

Latter-day Saint theology also teaches [[baptism for the dead]] in which deceased ancestors are baptized vicariously by the living, and believe that their practice is what Paul wrote of in Corinthians 15:29. This occurs in [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|Latter-day Saint temples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/topics/baptisms-for-the-dead?lang=eng |title= Gospel Topics: Baptisms for the Dead |website= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141208180901/http://www.lds.org/topics/baptisms-for-the-dead?lang=eng |archive-date= December 8, 2014 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoM Baptism for the dead"&gt;{{citation |last= Burton |first= H.

==Non-practitioners==

===Quakers===
[[Quakers]] (members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]]) do not believe in the baptism of either children or adults with water, rejecting all forms of outward [[sacraments]] in their religious life. [[Robert Barclay]]'s ''Apology for the True Christian Divinity'' (a historic explanation of Quaker theology from the 17th century), explains Quakers' opposition to baptism with water thus:

{{Quote|"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|Mt|3:11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here John mentions two manners of baptizings and two different baptisms, the one with water, and the other with the Spirit, the one whereof he was the minister of, the other whereof Christ was the minister of: and such as were baptized with the first were not therefore baptized with the second: "I indeed baptize you, but he shall baptize you." Though in the present time they were baptized with the baptism of water, yet they were not as yet, but were to be, baptized with the baptism of Christ.|[[Robert Barclay]], 1678&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/barclay/apology/prop12.html |title=Apology, Proposition 12 |publisher=Qhpress.org |accessdate=July 28, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090617033930/http://www.qhpress.org/texts/barclay/apology/prop12.html| archivedate= June 17, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Robert Barclay|Barclay]] argued that water baptism was only something that happened until the time of Christ, but that now, people are baptised inwardly by the spirit of Christ, and hence there is no need for the external sacrament of water baptism, which [[Quakers]] argue is meaningless.

===Salvation Army===
The [[Salvation Army]] does not practice water baptism, or indeed other outward [[sacraments]]. [[William Booth]] and [[Catherine Booth]], the founders of the [[Salvation Army]], believed that many Christians had come to rely on the outward signs of spiritual grace rather than on grace itself. They believed what was important was spiritual grace itself. However, although the [[Salvation Army]] does not practice baptism, they are not opposed to baptism within other Christian denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.salvationarmy.org.uk/uki/www_uki.nsf/vw-print/C28E39B2CA06E8F98025708A003D9FAC?openDocument |title=Why does The Salvation Army not baptise or hold communion? |publisher=The Salvation Army |date=February 28, 1987 |accessdate=July 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120233651/http://www1.salvationarmy.org.uk/uki/www_uki.nsf/vw-print/C28E39B2CA06E8F98025708A003D9FAC?openDocument |archivedate=November 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hyperdispensationalism===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from Baptism--&gt;
There are some Christians termed "[[Hyperdispensationalism|Hyperdispensationalists]]" (Mid-Acts dispensationalism) who accept only Paul's Epistles as directly applicable for the church today. They do not accept water baptism as a practice for the church since Paul who was God's apostle to the nations was not sent to baptize. Ultradispensationalists (Acts 28 dispensationalism) who do not accept the practice of the Lord's supper, do not practice baptism because these are not found in the Prison Epistles.&lt;ref&gt;"Prison epistles" include [[Ephesians]], [[Colossians]], [[Philippians]], and [[Epistle to Philemon|Philemon]]&lt;/ref&gt; Both sects believe water baptism was a valid practice for covenant Israel. Hyperdispensationalists also teach that Peter's gospel message was not the same as Paul's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David M. |last=Havard |title=Are We Hyper-Dispensationalists? |url=http://www.bereanbiblesociety.org/articles/1011392439.html |publisher=Berean Bible Society |accessdate=January 19, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090204081633/http://www.bereanbiblesociety.org/articles/1011392439.html| archivedate= February 4, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperdispensationalists assert:

*The great commission&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|28:18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its baptism is directed to early Jewish believers, not the Gentile believers of mid-Acts or later.
*The baptism of Acts 2:36–38 is Peter's call for Israel to repent of complicity in the death of their Messiah; not as a Gospel announcement of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for sin, a later doctrine revealed by Paul.

Water baptism found early in the Book of Acts is, according to this view, now supplanted by the one baptism&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2c|1cor|12:13||1 Cor 12:13}}&lt;/ref&gt; foretold by John the Baptist.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|3:16}}, {{bibleref2|John|1:33}}, {{bibleref2|Matt|3:11}}{{bibleref2|Acts|1:5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others make a distinction between John's prophesied baptism by Christ with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit's baptism of the believer into the body of Christ; the latter being the one baptism for today. The one baptism for today, it is asserted, is the "baptism of the [[Holy Spirit]]" of the believer into the Body of Christ church.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|Ac|11:15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many in this group also argue that John's promised [[Baptized by fire|baptism by fire]] is pending, referring to the destruction of the world by fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|3:12}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|3:17}}, {{bibleref2|2|Pe|3:10||2 Peter 3:10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John, as he said "baptized with water", as did Jesus's disciples to the early, Jewish Christian church. Jesus himself never personally baptized with water, but did so through his disciples.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|Jn|4:1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Jesus' first apostles, Paul, his apostle to the Gentiles, was sent to preach rather than to baptize&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|1Cor.|1:17||1 Co 1:17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contradiction to the Great Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|Mt|28:19}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Paul did occasionally still baptize Jews, for instance in Corinth&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c-nb|1Cor|1:14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Philippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|Ac|16:13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also taught the spiritual significance of Spirit baptism in identifying the believer with the atoning death of Christ, his burial, and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|Rom|6:4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romans 6 baptism does not mention nor imply water but is rather a real baptism into Christ's death.

Other Hyperdispensationalists believe that baptism was necessary until mid-Acts. The great commission&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|Mt|28:18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its baptism was directed to early Jewish believers, not the Gentile believers of mid-Acts or later. Any Jew who believed did not receive salvation&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|Mk|16:16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|1Peter|3:21||1 Pe 3:21}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the baptism of the Holy Spirit&lt;ref name="bibleref2c|Ac|2:38"/&gt; until they were water baptized. This period ended with the calling of Paul.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c-nb|Ac|9:17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter's reaction when the Gentiles received the Holy Spirit before baptism&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c-nb|Ac|10:44–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; is seen as proof of transition from water to Spirit baptism. Also significant is the lack of any instructions in the Acts 15 apostolic conference requiring Gentiles to be water baptized.

===Debaptism===
{{main|Debaptism}}
Most Christian churches see baptism as a once-in-a-lifetime event that can be [[sacramental character|neither repeated nor undone]]. They hold that those who have been baptized remain baptized, even if they renounce the Christian faith by adopting a non-Christian religion or by [[irreligion|rejecting religion]] entirely. But some other organizations and individuals are practicing debaptism.

| Baptism is a symbolization of [[Christ]]'s death, burial, and resurrection. It also signifies new birth, cleansing from sin, individual's response to God's grace, and acceptance into the faith community.
| Mostly immersion; others pouring. Most Disciples believe that [[believer's baptism]] and the practice of immersion were used in the [[New Testament]].

| [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]
| Baptism is necessary for salvation as part of the entire baptismal arrangement: as an expression of obedience to Jesus' command (Matthew 28:19–20), as a public symbol of the saving faith in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ (Romans 10:10), and as an indication of repentance from dead works and the dedication of one's life to Jehovah. (1 Peter 2:21) However, baptism does not guarantee salvation.&lt;ref&gt;''Worship the Only True God'', published by Jehovah's Witnesses (2002, 2006), "Chapter 12: The Meaning of Your Baptism", p. 118, "It would be a mistake to conclude that baptism is in itself a guarantee of salvation. It has value only if a person has truly dedicated himself to Jehovah through Jesus Christ and thereafter carries out God's will, being faithful to the end."&lt;/ref&gt;
| By submersion only; typical candidates are baptized at district and circuit conventions.&lt;ref&gt;"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1979, p. 31, "The Bible shows that baptism by complete immersion is very important. So even when unusual steps are necessary because of a person's condition, he should be baptized if at all possible. ...In modern times Jehovah's Witnesses have arranged for baptisms at conventions. [However], fully valid baptisms have even been performed locally in large home bathtubs. ...Of course, it might be that in some extreme case baptism would seem absolutely impossible for the time being. Then we trust that our merciful heavenly Father will understand".&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught that in baptism a child was cleansed of the guilt of original sin, initiated into the covenant with God, admitted into the church, made an heir of the divine kingdom, and spiritually born anew. He said that while baptism was neither essential to nor sufficient for salvation, it was the "ordinary means" that God designated for applying the benefits of the work of Christ in human lives. On the other hand, although he affirmed the regenerating grace of infant baptism, he also insisted upon the necessity of adult conversion for those who have fallen from grace. A person who matures into moral accountability must respond to God's grace in repentance and faith. Without personal decision and commitment to Christ, the baptismal gift is rendered ineffective. &lt;br /&gt; ''Baptism as Forgiveness of Sin''. In baptism God offers and we accept the forgiveness of our sin (Acts 2:38). With the pardoning of sin which has separated us from God, we are justified—freed from the guilt and penalty of sin and restored to right relationship with God. This reconciliation is made possible through the atonement of Christ and made real in our lives by the work of the Holy Spirit. We respond by confessing and repenting of our sin, and affirming our faith that Jesus Christ has accomplished all that is necessary for our salvation. Faith is the necessary condition for justification; in baptism, that faith is professed. God's forgiveness makes possible the renewal of our spiritual lives and our becoming new beings in Christ. &lt;br /&gt; ''Baptism as New Life''. Baptism is the sacramental sign of new life through and in Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit. Variously identified as regeneration, new birth, and being born again, this work of grace makes us into new spiritual creatures (2 Corinthians 5:17). We die to our old nature which was dominated by sin and enter into the very life of Christ who transforms us. Baptism is the means of entry into new life in Christ (John 3:5; Titus 3:5), but new birth may not always coincide with the moment of the administration of water or the laying on of hands. Our awareness and acceptance of our redemption by Christ and new life in him may vary throughout our lives. But, in whatever way the reality of the new birth is experienced, it carries out the promises God made to us in our baptism.|accessdate =August 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="By Water and the Spirit – Personal Faith"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=4&amp;mid=992| title = By Water and the Spirit: A United Methodist Understanding of Baptism|publisher = [[The United Methodist Church]]|quote= The United Methodist Church does not accept either the idea that only believer's baptism is valid or the notion that the baptism of infants magically imparts salvation apart from active personal faith.|accessdate =August 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other initiation ceremonies==
{{Main|Initiation}}
Many cultures practice or have practiced initiation rites, with or without the use of water, including the [[ancient Egyptian]], the [[Hebrews|Hebraic]]/Jewish, the [[Babylonia]]n, the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]], and the [[Norsemen|Norse]] cultures. The modern Japanese practice of [[Miyamairi]] is such as ceremony that does not use water. In some, such evidence may be [[archaeology|archaeological]] and descriptive in nature, rather than a modern practice.

===Mystery religion initiation rites===
[[Apuleius]], a 2nd-century [[Roman Empire|Roman]] writer, described an initiation into the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]] of [[Isis]]. The initiation was preceded by a normal bathing in the public baths and a ceremonial sprinkling by the priest of Isis, after which the candidate was given secret instructions in the temple of the goddess. The candidate then fasted for ten days from meat and wine, after which he was dressed in linen and led at night into the innermost part of the sanctuary, where the actual initiation, the details of which were secret, took place. On the next two days, dressed in the robes of his consecration, he participated in feasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Apuleius]] |others=trans. E. J. Kenney |chapter=11.23|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=EF44Zv5yFUcC&amp;pg=PA208 |title=The golden ass or Metamorphoses|publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=New York City |year=1998 |pages=208–210 |isbn=0-14-043590-5 |oclc=41174027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apuleius describes also an initiation into the cult of [[Osiris]] and yet a third initiation, of the same pattern as the initiation into the cult of Isis, without mention of a preliminary bathing.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''The Golden Ass'' (Penguin Books), pp. 211–214&lt;/ref&gt;

The water-less initiations of Lucius, the character in Apuleius's story who had been turned into an ass and changed back by Isis into human form, into the successive degrees of the rites of the goddess was accomplished only after a significant period of study to demonstrate his loyalty and trustworthiness, akin to [[catechumen]]al practices preceding baptism in Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Lars |last=Hartman |title=Into the Name of the Lord Jesus: Baptism in the Early Church |publisher=[[T&amp;T Clark]]|location=[[Edinburgh]] |year=1997 |page=4 |isbn=0-567-08589-9 |oclc=38189287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baptism of objects===
[[File:USS Dewey christening.jpg|upright=1.15|right|thumb|Christening of {{USS|Dewey|DDG-105|6}}]]
The word "baptism" or "christening" is sometimes used to describe the inauguration of certain objects for use.

====Boats and ships====
{{see also|Ceremonial ship launching}}
''Baptism of Ships'': at least since the time of the [[Crusades]], rituals have contained a blessing for ships. The priest begs God to bless the vessel and protect those who sail in. The ship is usually sprinkled with [[holy water]].&lt;ref name="cathen" /&gt;

====Church bells====
The name ''Baptism of Bells'' has been given to the blessing of ([[bell (instrument)|musical]], especially [[Church bell|church]]) bells, at least in France, since the 11th century. It is derived from the washing of the bell with [[holy water]] by the bishop, before he anoints it with the oil of the infirm without and with chrism within; a fuming [[censer]] is placed under it and the bishop prays that these [[sacramentals]] of the Church may, at the sound of the bell, put the demons to flight, protect from storms, and call the faithful to prayer.

====Dolls====

[[File:Relief Samothrace Louvre Ma697.jpg|thumb|right|[[Agamemnon]], [[Talthybius]] and Epeius, relief from [[Samothrace]], ca. 560 BC, [[Louvre]]]]

In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Cabeiri''' or '''Cabiri''' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|b|aɪ|r|aɪ}} ({{lang-grc|Κάβειροι}}, ''Kábeiroi''), also transliterated '''Kabiri''' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|b|ɪər|iː}},&lt;ref&gt;''Kabiri'' is the transliteration used in John Raffan's translation of [[Walter Burkert]], ''Greek Religion'' (Harvard University Press, 1985), and in most academic discourse.&lt;/ref&gt; were a group of enigmatic [[chthonic]] deities. They were worshiped in a [[mystery cult]] closely associated with that of [[Hephaestus]], centered in the north Aegean islands of [[Lemnos]] and possibly [[Samothrace]]—at the [[Samothrace temple complex]]—and at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite web|first=Harry Thurston|last=Peck|title=Cabeiria|work=Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities|year=1898|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.04.0062&amp;query=id%3dcabeiria#id,cabeiria|publisher=Tufts University: Perseus Project|accessdate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their distant origins the Cabeiri and the Samothracian gods may include pre-Greek elements,&lt;ref&gt;Walter Burkert, ''Greek Religion'' 1985 VI.1.3: '"the secret of the mysteries is rendered more enigmatic by the addition of a non-Greek, pre-Greek element, which is also hinted at in the [[Kaukones|Kaukon]] tradition of [[Andania]]" (a ''[[polis]]'' in [[Messenia]]).&lt;/ref&gt; or other non-Greek elements, such as [[Thracians|Thracian]], [[Tyrrhenians|Tyrrhenian]], [[Pelasgian]],&lt;ref&gt;"The inhabitants of Lemnos were called ''Tyrsenoi'' by the Greeks, and thus identified with the Etruscans, or alternatively with the Pelasgians." (Burkert 1985, ''eo. loc.'').&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phrygians|Phrygian]] or [[Hittites|Hittite]]. The [[Lemnian language|Lemnian]] cult was always local to Lemnos, but the Samothracian mystery cult spread rapidly throughout the Greek world during the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] period, eventually initiating Romans.

The ancient sources disagree about whether the deities of Samothrace were Cabeiri or not; and the accounts of the two cults differ in detail. But the two islands are close to each other, at the northern end of the Aegean, and the cults are at least similar, and neither fits easily into the [[Olympic gods|Olympic pantheon]]: the Cabeiri were given a mythic genealogy as sons of Hephaestus and [[Cabeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Acusilaus]], fr. 20; [[Pherecydes of Leros]] fr. 48; and [[Herodotus]] 3..37 are noted by Burkert.&lt;/ref&gt; The accounts of the Samothracian gods, whose names were secret, differ in the number and sexes of the gods: usually between two and four, some of either sex. The number of Cabeiri also varies, with some accounts citing four (often a pair of males and a pair of females), and some even more, such as a tribe or whole race of Cabeiri, often presented as all male.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, pp 281-84&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cabeiri were also worshipped at other sites in the vicinity, including [[Seuthopolis]] in [[Thrace]] and various sites in [[Asia Minor]]. According to [[Strabo]], Cabeiri are most honored in [[Imbros]] and [[Lemnos]] but also in other cities too.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], Geography.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and origin==
The Cabeiri were possibly originally [[Phrygians|Phrygia]]n&lt;ref&gt;According to [[scholia]] on Apollonius' ''[[Argonautica]]'' I. "The Phrygian origin of the Kabeiric cult asserted by [[Stesimbrotos of Thasos]] and recently defended by [[Otto Kern|O. Kern]] cannot, therefore, be rejected ''a priori''", wrote [[Giuliano Bonfante]], "A Note on the Samothracian Language" ''Hesperia'' '''24'''.2 (April 1955, pp. 101-109) p. 108; Bonfante agrees with [[Jacob Wackernagel]] that Κάβειροι cannot be Greek; Wackernagel suggested Thracian or Phrygian, in his opinion two closely related peoples.&lt;/ref&gt; deities and protectors of [[sailor]]s, who were imported into Greek ritual.&lt;ref&gt;"The secret of the mysteries is rendered more enigmatic by the addition of a non-Greek, pre-Greek element" (Burkert 1985:281). Burkert does not intend to suggest that the pre-Greek component was ''added''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] believes that their name is of non-Indo-European, [[pre-Greek]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]]. "The Origin of the Kabeiroi" ''Mnemosyne''. Vol. 57, Fasc. 4 (2004: 465–477); ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 612.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] word ''kabir'' ("great") has been compared to Κάβειροι since at least [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] in the sixteenth century, but nothing else seemed to point to a Semitic origin, until the idea of "great" gods expressed by the Semitic root ''kbr'' was definitively attested for North Syria in the thirteenth century BCE, in texts from [[Emar]] published by D.&amp;nbsp;Arnaud in 1985–87. [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling]] connected the Greek word to  the Hebrew חבר (''khaver'' "friend, associate") and via this to several priest names as one attached to the Persians ("Chaverim"), linking them to the [[Dioskouri]] or priestly blacksmiths alternatively.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling: ''Ueber die Gottheiten von Samothrace''. Stuttgart and Tübingen (Cotta) 1815, p.&amp;nbsp;110 sqq. ([https://archive.org/stream/ueberdiegottheit01sche#page/110/mode/2up online text]).&lt;/ref&gt; T.&amp;nbsp;J. Wackernagel produced an Indian etymology in 1907;&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Walter Burkert, ''The Orientalizing revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age'' (1992, p 2 note 3).&lt;/ref&gt; in 1925 [[A. H. Sayce]] had suggested a connection to [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''[[Habiru|habiri]]'' ("looters", "outlaws"), but subsequent discoveries have made this implausible on phonological grounds. Dossein compares Κάβειροι to the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] word ''kabar'', "[[copper]]."&lt;ref&gt;Buckert, ''Greek Religion'' (1985), p. 282 and notes on page 457.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the ''Cabeiri'' recalls Mount Kabeiros, a mountain in the region of Berekyntia in Asia Minor, closely associated with the [[Phrygia]]n [[mother goddess|Mother Goddess]]. The name of Kadmilus (Καδμῖλος), or ''Kasmilos'', one of the Cabeiri who was usually depicted as a young boy, was linked even in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] to ''Camillus'', an old [[Latin]] word for a boy-attendant in a cult, likely a loan from the [[Etruscan language]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} which may be related to Lemnian.&lt;ref&gt;The Aegean relations of the Etruscan language are denied  at some length by [[Massimo Pallottino]], in ''The Etruscans'' (tr. 1975) and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Beekes, the name ''Kadmilus'' may be of pre-Greek origin, as seems to be the case with the name ''[[Cadmus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;R. S. P. Beekes, ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, pp. 613–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depiction in literary sources==
They were most commonly depicted as two people: an old man, Axiocersus, and his son, Cadmilus. Due to the cult's secrecy, however, their exact nature and relationship with other ancient Greek and [[Thrace|Thracian]] religious figures remained mysterious. As a result, the membership and roles of the Cabeiri changed significantly over time, with common variants including a female pair (Axierus and Axiocersa) and twin youths (frequently confused with [[Castor and Pollux]], who were also worshiped as protectors of sailors).

==Lemnos==
The Lemnians were originally non-Greek; they were Hellenized after [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]] conquered the island for Athens in the sixth century BCE. In [[Lemnos]] the cult of the Cabeiri survived, according to archaeological evidence, through the conquest: an ancient sanctuary dedicated to the Cabeiri is identifiable by traces of inscriptions, and seems to have survived the program of Hellenization. [[Walter Burkert]] records that wine jars are "the only characteristic group of finds" from the Cabeirium of Lemnos and that the Cabeirium was the location for initiation into an ancient mystery cult.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', p. 281; ,&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the secret nature of mystery cults in the ancient world little survives to indicate what was involved in these initiation ceremonies; indeed, Hugh Bowden notes that on the basis of our evidence we do not know what happened at Lemnos beyond the fact of initiation, and that 'we have no descriptions and nothing on which even to base speculation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowden|first1=Hugh|title=Mystery Cults of the Ancient World|date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691146386|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The geographer [[Strabo]] reported (Geogr. 10,3,21) that in Lemnos, the mother (there was no father) of the Cabeiri was '''Kabeiro''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Καβειρώ) herself, a daughter of [[Nereus]] (one of the "old men of the sea") and a goddess whom the Greeks might have called [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]].

In general Greek myth identifies the Cabeiri as divine craftsmen, sons or grandsons of [[Hephaestus]], who was also chiefly worshipped on Lemnos. [[Aeschylus]] wrote a tragedy called ''The Kabeiroi'', which apparently featured the deities as a chorus greeting the [[Argonauts]] at Lemnos and the Argonauts' initiation into the cult of the Cabeiri.

==Samothrace==
The [[Samothrace|Samothracians]] were also originally non-Greek, and are associated with the [[Troy|Trojans]] and the [[Pelasgians]]; they used a foreign language in the temple through [[Julius Caesar]]'s time.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'' 282, citing [[Diodorus]], 5.47.3, which says that their own language is still used in religion.&lt;/ref&gt; Samothrace offered an initiatory mystery, which promised safety and prosperity to seamen. The secret of these mysteries has largely been kept; but we know that of three things about the ritual, the aspirants were asked the worst action they had ever committed.{{clarify|date=June 2014}}&lt;!--The second half of this sentence is not clear.--&gt;

The mysteries of Samothrace did not publish the names of their gods; and the offerings at the shrine are all inscribed ''to the gods'' or ''to the great gods'' rather than with their names. But ancient sources&lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi 1951:87 note 210 credits a [[scholium]] on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'' i.916, for the connection of the four names  of divinities recorded at Samothrace— Axieros, Axiokersa, Axiokersos and Kadmilos — with [[Demeter]], [[Persephone]], [[Hades]] and [[Hermes]] respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; tell us that there were two goddesses and a god: ''Axieros'', ''Axiokersa'', and ''Axiokersos'', and their servant ''Cadmilos'' or ''Casmilos''. [[Karl Kerényi]] conjectured that Axieros was male, and the three gods were the sons of Axiokersa (Cadmilos, the youngest, was also the father of the three); Burkert disagrees.&lt;ref&gt;Kerényi, ''Gods of Greece'' 1951:86-7; Burkert ''Greek Religion'' 1985:283 and notes.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Classical Greek culture the mysteries of the Cabeiri at Samothrace remained popular, though little was entrusted to writing beyond a few names and bare genealogical connections. Seamen among the Greeks might invoke the Cabeiri as "great gods" in times of danger and stress. The archaic sanctuary of Samothrace was rebuilt in Greek fashion; by classical times, the Samothrace mysteries of the Cabeiri were known at Athens. [[Herodotus]] had been initiated. But at the entrance to the sanctuary, which has been thoroughly excavated, the Roman antiquary [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] learned that there had been twin pillars of brass, phallic [[herma]]e, and that in the sanctuary it was understood that the child of the Goddess, Cadmilus, was in some mystic sense also her consort. Varro also describes these twin pillars as Heaven and Earth, denying the vulgar error that they are [[Castor and Pollux]].

==Thebes in Boeotia==
At [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] in [[Boeotia]] there are more varied finds than on Lemnos; they include many little bronze votive [[bull (mythology)|bulls]] and which carry on into Roman times, when the traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], always alert to the history of [[cult (religion)|cults]], learned that it was [[Demeter]] ''Kabeiriia'' who instigated the initiation cult there in the name of [[Prometheus]] and his son Aitnaios. [[Walter Burkert]] (1985) writes, "This points to guilds of smiths analogous to the Lemnian Hephaistos." The votive dedications at Thebes are to a ''Kabeiros'' (Greek: Κάβειρος) in the singular, and childish toys like votive spinning tops for ''Pais'' suggest a manhood initiation. Copious wine was drunk, out of characteristic cups that were ritually smashed. Fat, primitive dwarves (similar to the followers of [[Silenus]]) with prominent genitalia were painted on the cups. Thebes is connected to Samothrace in myth, primarily the wedding of [[Cadmus]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]], which took place there.

==Myth==
In myth, the Cabeiri bear many similarities to other fabulous races, such as the [[Telchines]] of [[Rhodes]], the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], the [[dactyl (mythology)|Dactyls]], the [[Korybantes]], and the Kuretes. These different groups were often confused or identified with one another since many of them, like the Cyclopes and Telchines, were also associated with [[metallurgy]].

[[Diodorus Siculus]] said of the Cabeiri that they were ''Idaioi dactyloi'' ("Idaian [[dactyl (mythology)|Dactyls]]"). The Idaian Dactyls were a race of divine beings associated with the [[mother goddess|Mother Goddess]] and with [[Mount Ida]], a mountain in [[Phrygia]] sacred to the goddess. [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] wrote that the Cabeiri were ''karkinoi'' ("[[crab]]s", in modern Greek: "Καβούρια", ''kavouria''). The Cabeiri as Karkinoi were apparently thought of as amphibious beings (again recalling the Telchines). They had pincers instead of hands, which they used as [[tongs]] (Greek: ''karkina'') in metalworking.

It has been suggested by Comyns Beaumont&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont, Comyns. Britain The Key To World History p.31&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Orpheus|Orphic]] mysteries may have had their origins with the Cabeiri.

'''Charlotte Maria Tucker''' (8 May 1821 – 2 December 1893) was a prolific writer and poet for children and adults, who wrote under the pseudonym '''A.L.O.E.''' (a Lady of England). Late in life she spent a period as a volunteer missionary in India, where she died.

==Early life==
Charlotte Tucker was born at Friern Hatch near [[Friern Barnet]], [[Middlesex]], the daughter of [[Henry St George Tucker]] (1771/2–1851), twice elected chairman of the [[British East India Company]], and his wife Jane Boswell (died 1869), the daughter of an [[Edinburgh]] [[writer to the signet]]. The family moved to London in 1822. Her father was the author of ''Tragedies: 'Harold' and 'Camoens''' (London, 1835).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|title=Henry St George Tucker|first= Katherine|last=Prior.|id=27789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlotte had a secular upbringing, and her first writings were poems and plays to amuse the family. In 1847, she took charge of the education of her brother Robert's three children. Her earliest book ''The Claremont Tales'' (1852) was, she said, "originally composed for young children under my charge."&lt;ref name="ODNB1"&gt;{{cite ODNB|title=Charlotte Maria Tucker|first= Kimberley|last=Reynolds. |id=27788 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral tales==
The work of Charlotte Tucker as a children's writer was imbued with her [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical religious beliefs]]. Most of her stories were allegories with a clear moral, but she leavened her didacticism with a degree of realism and naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;Orlando Project. [http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/svPeople?person_id=tuckch Retrieved 12 October 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; As she explained in an 1851 letter to a publisher, "My position in life renders me independent of any exertions of my own; I pray but for God's blessing upon my attempts to instruct His lambs in the things which concern their everlasting welfare."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Gillian Avery]]: ''Nineteenth Century Children...'' (London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1965), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of her 150 or more titles appeared in magazines before being collected into books. Among her many titles were ''The Rambles of a Rat'', ''Parliament in the Play-Room'' (1863), ''Triumph over Midian'' (1866), ''A Wreath of Smoke'' (1871) and ''Pomegranates from the Punjab'' (1878). A biography by a fellow children's writer, [[Agnes Giberne]], appeared in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;''A Lady of England. The Life and Letters of Charlotte Maria Tucker'' (London : Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1895). [https://archive.org/details/ladyofenglandlif00gibe Retrieved 12 October 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The proceeds from her writings she often devoted to missionary or charity work. Tucker's contemporaries criticized the strong didacticism in her writing, but her creed was concerned not with original sin but with the chance of improvement for all people and races. Her realistic portrayals of the poor may have drawn on her experience as a [[workhouse]] visitor in [[Marylebone]].&lt;ref name ="ODNB1" /&gt; Titles of hers are still occasionally reissued by publishers specializing in Christian books, including Lamplighter Ministries, an American nonprofit organization headquartered in [[Mount Morris, New York]], best known for its Lamplighter Family Collection series.&lt;ref&gt;E. g. [http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/search?author=Charlotte%20Maria%20Tucker&amp;detailed_search=1&amp;action=Search Retrieved 12 October 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missionary work==
Many of Tucker's most interesting stories are set in [[India]]. Some were translated into Indian languages. She set out for India in 1875, at the age of 54, having taught herself [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]. There she worked as a self-supporting volunteer missionary to [[Amritsar]], [[Punjab]], through the Indian Female Normal School and Instruction Society. Three years later she moved to nearby [[Batala]], where she worked in a boys' school and as a teacher of Christian beliefs to native women. She died in Amritsar on 2 December 1893.&lt;ref name= "ODNB1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2907">'''Chen Yueyi''' ({{zh|t=陳月儀}}; 565?-650?), later [[Buddhist]] nun name '''Huaguang''' (華光), was a [[concubine]] of [[Emperor Xuan of Northern Zhou]], an [[emperor]] of the [[History of China|Chinese]]/[[Xianbei]] dynasty [[Northern Zhou]].

Chen Yueyi's father was Chen Shanti (陳山提), and she was his eighth daughter.  Chen Shanti was initially a servant of the [[Northern Wei]] general [[Erzhu Zhao]], and after Erzhu's defeat by [[Gao Huan]] became a servant to Gao.  He served as a general in several administrations of [[Northern Qi]], founded by Gao's son [[Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi]], eventually achieving the title of Prince of Xieyang.  After [[Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou]] destroyed Northern Qi in 577, Chen Shanti became a Northern Zhou general and carried the title of Duke of Xiyang.  In 579, Chen Yueyi was selected to be an imperial consort for Emperor Xuan, with the title of ''Defei'' (德妃).  A month later, Emperor Xuan passed the throne to his son [[Emperor Jing of Northern Zhou|Emperor Jing]] and took an atypical title for a [[Taishang Huang|retired emperor]], "Emperor Tianyuan" (天元皇帝, ''Tianyuan Huangdi'').  He subsequently decided that in addition to his wife [[Yang Lihua]], he would create three more [[empress]]es, and Consort Chen was selected as one—with the title of ''Empress Tianzuo'' (天左皇后, ''Tianzuo Huanghou''), subsequently changed in spring 580 to ''Tianzuo Da Huanghou'' (天左大皇后).  Subsequently, as he wanted to create one more empress, he changed her title to ''Tianzhong Da Huanghou'' (天中大皇后) so that her ''Tianzuo Da Huanghou'' title could be given to [[Empress Yuchi Chifan]].  Among the empresses, she was said to be closest to [[Empress Yuan Leshang]], as they entered the palace at the same time and were the same age, and they were also both favored by Emperor Xuan.

Emperor Xuan died in summer 580, and Empress Yang's father [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Yang Jian]] became [[regent]].  Empress Chen became a Buddhist nun with the name of Huaguang, and she outlived Yang Jian's subsequent [[Sui Dynasty]].  According to both the ''[[Book of Zhou]]'' and ''[[History of Northern Dynasties]]'', she was still alive as of the reign of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] (626-649), but nothing further was recorded in either of those two official histories about her.&lt;ref&gt;Her [[Chinese Wikipedia]] article [[:zh:陳月儀]] indicates that she died in 650, but does not cite a source.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dasam Patishah Ji Da Granth''' ('''[[Gurmukhi script|Gurmukhi]]''':''' ਦਸਮ ਪਾਤਿਸ਼ਾਹ ਦਾ ਗ੍ਰੰਥ'''), commonly known as '''Dasam Granth''' ([[Gurmukhi script|Gurmukhi]]: ਦਸਮ ਗ੍ਰੰਥ), is a [[religious text]] containing many of the texts traditionally attributed to [[Guru Gobind Singh]]. It is written primarily in [[Braj Bhasha]], with [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] compositions written almost entirely in the Gurmukhi script except for the ''Fatehnama'', ''Zafar Nama'' and ''Hikayat'', which are in the [[Persian alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Singha|first=H. S.|title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism (over 1000 Entries)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqIbJz7vMn0C|year=2000|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=978-81-7010-301-1}}, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dasam Granth'' is a separate religious text from the [[Guru Granth Sahib]].&lt;ref name="McLeod1990"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=McLeod|first=W. H.|authorlink=W. H. McLeod|title=Textual Sources for the Study of Sikhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xIT7OMSJ44C&amp;pg=PA6|year=1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-56085-4}}, page 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Some compositions of the ''Dasam Granth'' such as [[Jaap Sahib]], [[Tav-Prasad Savaiye]] and [[Chaupai (Sikhism)|Benti Chaupai]] are part of the [[Nitnem]] or daily prayers and also part of the [[Amrit Sanchar]] or baptism ceremony.

== Authorship ==

Although the compositions of the ''Dasam Granth'' are widely accepted to be penned by Guru Gobind Singh there are some that still question the authenticity of the ''Dasam Granth''. There are three major views on the authorship of the ''Dasam Granth'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLeod|first=W. H.|title=Historical dictionary of Sikhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ma3G-hjh6SwC&amp;pg=PA52|accessdate=2 June 2010|date=2005-07-28|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8108-5088-0|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The historical and traditional view is that the entire work was composed by Guru Gobind Singh himself.
# The entire collection was composed by the poets in the Guru's entourage.
# Only a part of the work was composed by the Guru, while the rest was composed by the other poets.

In his religious court at [[Anandpur Sahib]], Guru Gobind Singh had employed 52 poets, who translated several classical texts into Braj Bhasha. Most of the writing compiled at Anandpur Sahib was lost while the Guru's camp was crossing the Sirsa river before the [[Battle of Chamkaur (1704)]]. There were copiers available at Guru's place who made several copies of writings. Later, [[Bhai Mani Singh]] compiled all the available works under the title ''Dasam Granth''.

The traditional scholars claim that all the works in ''Dasam Granth'' were composed by the Guru himself, on the basis of Bhai Mani Singh's letter. But the veracity of the letter has been examined by scholars and found to be unreliable. Any one even moderately acquainted with Hindi can tell from the internal evidence of style that Chandi Charitar and Bhagauti ki War are translations by different hands. Some others dispute the claim of the authorship, saying that some of the compositions included in ''Dasam Granth'' (such as ''Charitropakhyan'') are "out of tune" with other Sikh scriptures, and must have been composed by other poets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume One (A To Devo), Volume 1 | editor = Amaresh Datta | publisher = [[Sahitya Akademi]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-81-260-1803-1 | page = 888}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of poets Raam, Shyam and Kaal appear repeatedly in the granth. References to Kavi Shyam can be seen in Mahan Kosh of Bhai Kahan Singh Nabha, under the entry 'Bawanja Kavi' and also in Kavi Santokh Singh's magnum opus Suraj Prakash Granth.

=== Historical writings ===
The following are historical books after the demise of Guru Gobind Singh which mention that the compositions in the present ''Dasam Granth'' was written by Guru Gobind Singh:
* Rehitnama Bhai Nand Lal mentioned Jaap Sahib is an important Bani for a Sikh.&lt;ref name="Rehitnama2005"&gt;Rehitnama Bhai Nand Lal&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rehitnama Chaupa Singh Chibber quotes various lines from Bachitar Natak, 33 Swiayey, Chopai Sahib, Jaap Sahib.&lt;ref name="RehitnamaChaupa"&gt;Rehitnama Chaupa Singh Chibber&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1711, Sri Gur Sobha was written by the poet Senapat and mentioned a conversation of Guru Gobind Singh and Akal Purakh, and written three of its Adhyay on base of Bachitar Natak.&lt;ref name="Gursobha005"&gt;Sri Gur Sbha Granth, Poet Senapat, Piara Singh Padam&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1741, Parchian Srvadas Kian quoted lines from Rama Avtar, 33 Swaiyey and mentioned Zafarnama with Hikayats.&lt;ref&gt;Parchi Sevadas Ki, Poet Sevada, Piara Singh Padam&lt;/ref&gt;
* in 1751, Gurbilas Patshahi 10 – Koyar Singh Kalal, mentioned Guru Gobind Singh composed Bachitar Natak, Krisna Avtar, Bisan Avtar, Akal Ustat, Jaap Sahib, Zafarnama, Hikayats etc. This is first Granth mentioned Guruship of Guru Granth Shahib.&lt;ref&gt;Gurbilas, Patshahi 10, Koer Singh, Bhasha Vibagh, Punjabi University&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1766, Kesar Singh Chibber mentioned history of compilation of ''Dasam Granth'' by Bhai Mani Singh Khalsa on directions of Mata Sundri, as he was first who wrote history after death of Guru Gobind Singh.
* In 1766, Sri Guru Mahima Parkash – Sarup Chand Bhalla, mentioned about various Banis of Guru Gobind Singh and compilation of ''Dasam Granth''
* In 1790, Guru Kian Sakhian – Svarup Singh Kashish, mentioned Guru Gobind Singh composed, bachitar Natak, Krishna Avtar, Shastarnaam Mala, 33 Swaiyey etc.
* In 1797, Gurbilas Patshahi 10 – Sukkha Singh, mentioned compositions of Guru Gobind Singh.
* In 1812, J. B. Malcolm, in SKetch of Sikhs mentioned about ''Dasam Granth'' as Bani of Guru Gobind Singh.

== Structure ==
'''The length of the printed version of ''Dasam Granth'' is 1428 pages.'''&lt;ref&gt;Page 52, The A to Z of Sikhism (Google eBook), W. H. McLeod, Scarecrow Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 6, Dasam Granth, Dr. S. S. Kapoor, Hemkunt Press&lt;/ref&gt;

It contains the Jaap Sahib, the [[Akal Ustat]] or praise of the Creator and the [[Bachittar Natak]], which gives an account of the Guru's parentage, his divine mission and the battles in which he had been engaged.

Next come three abridged compositions of the wars of [[Durga]], called [[Chandi]], with demons (Chandi Chritras: Chandi Chritra I, Chandi Chritra II, [[Chandi di Var]]).

Following this is the Gyan Parbodh, or awakening of knowledge; the Shabad Hazare; [[quatrain]]s called [[Savaiya|''savaiye'']] (singular ''savaiya''), which are hymns in praise of God and reprobation of idolatry and hypocrisy; the Shastar Nam Mala, a list of offensive and defensive weapons used in the Guru's time with special reference to the attributes of the Creator; the Kabiovach Bainti Chaupai, which will "absolve the suffering, pain or fear of the person, who will even once recite this Bani";{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} the [[Zafarnama (letter)|Zafarnamah]], containing the Tenth Guru's epistle to the emperor Aurangzeb; and ''hikayat''s, [[Persian language]] metrical tales.

== Role in Sikh liturgy ==
The compositions within ''Dasam Granth'' play a huge role in Sikh liturgy, which is prescribed by [[Sikh Rehat Maryada]]:
* Jaap Sahib is part of [[Nitnem]], which Sikh recites daily in morning.&lt;ref name="Sikhsdiaspora"&gt;Page 133, Sikhs in the Diaspora, Surinder Singh bakhshi, Dr Surinder Bakhshi, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="srmdasam"&gt;''The Japu, the Jaapu and the Ten Sawayyas (Quartets) – beginning "Sarwag sudh"-- in the morning.'': Chapter III, Article IV, Sikh Rehat Maryada&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tav-Prasad Savaiye]], again a bani of Nitnem, is part of Akal Ustat composition, which is recited daily in morning along with above.&lt;ref name="Sikhsdiaspora" /&gt;
* [[Chaupai (Sikhism)|Benti Chaupai]], is part of [[Sri Charitropakhyan]], which is recited in morning as well as evening prayers.&lt;ref name="srmdasam" /&gt;
* Jaap, Tav Prasad Savaiye and Chaupai are read while preparing Khande Batey Ki Pahul.
* The first stanza of the Sikh [[ardās]], an invocation to God and the nine Gurus preceding Gobind Singh, is from Chandi di Var.
* As per Sikh Rehat Maryada, a stanza of Chaubis Avtar, "pae gahe jab te tumre", should be comprised in So Dar Rehras.&lt;ref&gt;''iii) the Sawayya beginning with the words "pae gahe jab te tumre"'': Article IV, Chapter III, Sikh Rehat Maryada&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chandi di Var]] is important prayer among [[Nihang]] Sikhs.

== Compilation ==
[[File:Bhaimanisingh.jpg|right|thumb|Letter of [[Bhai Mani Singh]] discussing the compilation of various [[Gurbani|banis]] of ''Dasam Granth'']]
The Guru by his time at [[Damdama Sahib]], around 1705, assembled a large set of literature on ''[[brahmavidya|bramvidiya]]'' and other topics much was formed by his 52 poets and some say that these 52 poets also contributed directly to the Dasam Granth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johar|first1=Surinder|title=Guru Gobind Singh: A Multi-faceted Personality|date=1999|publisher=Publications Pvt. Ltd.,  Publications Pvt. Ltd.,|isbn=9788175330931|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving full manuscript of the ''Dasam Granth'' dates to 1713,&lt;ref name="Britannica2009" /&gt; although it appears not to have been publicly available. In 1721, [[Mata Sundari]] commissioned [[Bhai Mani Singh]] with compiling a volume of the ''Dasam Granth''.&lt;ref name="Mansukhani1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mansukhani|first=Gobind Singh|title=Hymns from the Dasam Granth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59EOQ2M7dQkC&amp;pg=PR10|accessdate=15 July 2010|year=1993|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=978-81-7010-180-2|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his manuscript after collecting and sifting through material collected from a number of Sikhs. "Minor textual variation" exist between the early manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Britannica2009" /&gt;

Giani Gian Singh claims that the full copy of the ''Dasam Granth'' was in possession of the [[Budha Dal]], an 18th-century Sikh army, at the [[Battle of Kup]] and was lost during the [[Second Sikh Holocaust (1762)]]&lt;ref&gt;Giani Kirpal Singh (samp.), Sri Gur Panth Parkash, Vol. 3 (Amritsar: Manmohan Singh Brar, 1973), pp. 1678–80, verses 61-62&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1890s the text was standardized into its current two-volume 1,428 page print version.&lt;ref name="Britannica2009" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14255">A '''dera''' is a type of socio-religious organization in northern [[India]]. Jacob Copeman defines the deras as "monasteries or the extended residential sites of religious leaders; frequently just glossed as sect".{{sfn|Jacob Copeman|2012|p=156}}

Several deras started out as non-orthodox [[Sikhism|Sikh]] sects, and many of them are now centres of distinct non-Sikh religious movements. Many Deras have attracted a large number of outcast [[Dalit]]s, who earlier embraced Sikhism to escape the [[Hindu caste system|Hindu casteism]], but felt socially excluded by the [[Jat Sikh]]-dominated clerical establishment.

== History ==

The word Dera derives from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''Derah'' or ''Dirah'', which literally means a camp, abode, monastery or convent.{{sfn|Kahn Singh Nabhaa|2004|p=421}}

The phenomenon of Dera, as sectarian institution, is not new in Punjab and it is much older than the Sikh faith and [[Panth]]. Deras in Punjab, before the Sikh faith, belonged to [[Sufi]] [[Pir (Sufism)|Pirs]], [[Yogi Nath]]s, and [[Sant (religion)|Sants]] of [[Bhakti movement]].{{sfn|Surinder Singh|2009|p=33}} In Punjab, the popularity of Sufi Pirs/Sants or their Shrines can be seen through their veneration across the communities such as Hindu, Sikh and Muslim. Shrines of Sufis were known as [[khanqah]]s. The major function of khanqah was to provide relief to people of all communities, particularly the lower strata of different communities. Several khanqahs were built and facilities were provided to lower castes of Hindu populace in rural areas. Khanqahs with modest hospitality and generosity offered spiritual guidance, psychological support and counseling that was free and open to all people. By doing so, khanqahs challenged the establishment of stratified social structure either Hindu or Muslim societies. Soon, khanqahs became epicenters of socio-cultural and theological activities of people from all ethnic and religious backgrounds and genders. Sufi shrines of Sakhi Sarvar Sultan, Sheikh Farid, Bulhe Shah, Sheikh Fattha, Khwaja Khizr, and Five Pirs(Panj Pir) were the manifestation of the shared devoutness of Punjabis.{{sfn|Surinder Singh|Jasbir Singh|2017|pp=149-150}}

Even during the lifetime of the [[Sikh Gurus]], several deras had been established, many of them by the rival claimants to the "Guru" title. These deras included those of the [[Udasi]]s, the [[Mina (Sikhism)|Minas]], the Dhirmalias, the [[Ramraiya]]s, the Handalis, and the [[Masand|Massandis]].{{sfn|Ronki Ram|2007|p=4067}} During the consolidation of the Sikh religion, several more deras cropped up. These included the deras of Bandei Khalsa ([[Banda Singh Bahadur|Bandapanthis]]), [[Nanakpanthi]]s, Sewapanthis, Bhaktpanthi, Suthrashahi, Gulabdasi, [[Nirmala Sikhs|Nirmalas]] and the [[Nihang]]s.{{sfn|Ronki Ram|2007|p=4067}}

19th century onwards, several more deras came into being. The distinguishing characteristic of these new deras was that they acted as centres of [[Dalit]] mobilization.{{sfn|Ronki Ram|2007|p=4067}} The majority of the followers of these deras were people of Dalit background, who had embraced [[Sikhism]] to escape the casteist [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[varna (Hinduism)|varna]] system. However, they continued to experience social exclusion in the caste hierarchy of the Sikh society, which pushed them towards the deras and other organizations that promise social equality.{{sfn|Ronki Ram|2007|p=4066}} The increasing politicization of the Sikh institutions - the [[Akal Takht]] and the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee|SGPC]] - and their domination by Jat Sikhs has driven a large number of people to the Deras as well.{{sfn|Ashutosh Kumar|2014|p=341}} The affluent Dalits among the [[Punjabi diaspora]] have also contributed to the growth of the deras.{{sfn|Ashutosh Kumar|2014|p=342}}

== Major deras ==

According to a 2006-2007 study, there were more than 9,000 Sikh and non-Sikh deras in the rural areas of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].{{sfn|Ronki Ram|2007|p=4067}} A number of deras are also located in the neighbouring states of [[Haryana]], [[Rajasthan]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]].{{sfn|Ashutosh Kumar|2014|p=336}}

=== Sikh deras ===

The Sikh deras strictly observe the ''[[Sikh Rehat Maryada|Rehat Maryada]]'' (Sikh code of conduct). The majority of their followers and leaders are from the [[Jat Sikh]] community.{{sfn|Ronki Ram|2007|p=4067}} The leaders of these deras are rarely non-Jat, and never a Dalit. However, there are several Dalit [[sewadar]]s, [[granthi]]s, [[ragi (Sikhism)|ragis]], and [[kirtan]] performers in these deras.{{sfn|Ronki Ram|2007|p=4067}}

Some of the prominent Sikh deras include those of:{{sfn|Ashutosh Kumar|2014|p=344}}

* [[Damdami Taksal]]-led Sant Samaj
* Dera Nanaksar
* Sant Ajit Singh Hansali
* Sant Daya Singh Sursingh Wale
* Sant Sewa Singh Rampur Khera
* Parmeshwar Dwar Gurmat Prachar Sewa Mission
* Dera Baba Rumi Wala (Bhucho Kalan)

=== Non-Sikh deras ===

The non-Sikh deras do not abide by the Sikh ''Rehyat Maryada''. Along with the Sikh [[gurbani]], they also recite non-Sikh texts, and some of them also indulge in [[idol worship]]. Unlike the Sikh deras, where the holy book ''Guru Granth Sahib'' is considered as the only current guru, the non-Sikh deras practice devotion towards a contemporary human guru.{{sfn|Ronki Ram|2007|p=4067}}

Some of the major non-Sikh deras include:{{sfn|Ronki Ram|2007|p=4067}}{{sfn|Ashutosh Kumar|2014|p=343}}

* [[Radha Soami]]s (Dera Beas)
* [[Dera Sacha Sauda]]
* [[Nirankari Sikh|Sant Nirankari Mission]]
* [[Namdhari]]s
* [[Divya Jyoti Sansthan]]
* [[Piara Singh Bhaniara|Bhaniarawala Dera]]
* [[Dera Baba Bhuman Shah]] (Sanghar Sadha)
* [[Ravidassia religion|Ravidasis]] (including [[Dera Sach Khand]])

Rev Saint Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insan.jpg | [[Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh]] of the [[Dera Sacha Sauda]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The majority of the followers of these deras are [[Dalit]]s, [[Other Backward Classes|Backward castes]], and the poor among the [[Jat Sikh]]s. However, most of the deras are led by people from upper-caste backgrounds. As of 2007, the Nirankaris were led by a [[Khatri]]; the Dera Sacha Sauda was led by a Jat Sikh of Sidhu sub-caste; and the Radha Saomis were led by a Jat Sikh of the Dhillon sub-caste.{{sfn|Ronki Ram|2007|p=4067}}

The Dalit-dominated deras have emerged as major centres of [[counter-culture]], where the Dalits assert their pride, customs and tradition.{{sfn|Ashutosh Kumar|2014|p=336}}

== Conflicts with the Khalsa Sikhs ==

The deras are seen as a challenge to the mainstream Sikhism represented by the [[Khalsa]] Sikh identity. The total number of the followers of the various deras far exceeds the number of followers of the [[Golden Temple]]-based clerical establishment (the [[Akal Takht]]).{{sfn|Ronki Ram|2007|p=4067}}

The tensions between the Dalits and the Jats have manifested in form of conflicts involving the Deras. Some of these incidents include:{{sfn|Ronki Ram|2007|p=4068}}

; [[1978 Sikh–Nirankari clashes|Sikh–Nirankari clashes]] (1978)
: In 1978, the orthodox Sikhs denounced the Sant Nirankaris as false Sikhs, and demanded closure of all the Nirankari centres. In 1978, some Sikhs tried to forcibly shut down the annual Nirankari convention in [[Amritsar]]. In the ensuing clash, 12 Sikhs and 3 Nirankaris were killed. In 1980, the Nirankari leader [[Gurbachan Singh]] was shot dead.{{sfn|Harjot Oberoi|1996|p=273}}

; [[Piara Singh Bhaniara#Conflict with the Khalsa Sikhs|Bhaniarawala crisis]] (2001)
: The dera leader Piara Singh Bhaniara imitated Guru Gobind Singh, and launched a new holy book ''[[Bhavsagar Granth]]'', after his followers were disallowed from carrying the Sikh holy book ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]''. This led to violent clashes between the Khalsa Sikhs and the followers of Bhaniara.{{sfn|Meeta|Rajivlochan|2007|p=1911}}

; Meham dispute (2006)
: In the [[Meham]] village, the [[Ad Dharmi]] Dalits had been maintaining the [[Udasi]] dera of Baba Khazan Singh for six decades. They offered liquor as ''[[prasad]]'' at the dera, and also distributed it among the devotees. In 2003, the Sikhs placed a copy of ''Guru Granth Sahib'' at the dera, and later objected to the liquor offering, arguing that it was against the Sikh [[Sikh Rehat Maryada|rehyat maryada]]. In 2006, they forcibly took control of the dera, and replaced all Udasi symbols with the Khalsa symbols. This led to a clash between the two communities. However, the timely police intervention prevented escalations. The dera was placed under a government official, and the dispute was referred to the court.{{sfn|Ronki Ram|2007|p=4072}}

; Vienna killings (2007)
: On 25 May 2007, six orthodox Sikhs attacked the [[Ravidassia]] members of [[Dera Sach Khand]] with a gun and knives, at a gurdwara in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. The Dera leader Niranjan Das, who was visiting the gurdwara built by the Dera members, was seriously wounded in the attack. Two people died in the attack, including Das' deputy Rama Nand.{{sfn|Doris R. Jakobsh|2014|pp=176-177}} The incident led to clashes in India as well, and prompted the Ravidassias to explicitly declare their religion as separate from Sikhism.{{sfn|Ashutosh Kumar|2014|p=343}}

; [[Dera Sacha Sauda#2007 clashes with Khalsa Sikhs|Sikh-Dera Sacha Sauda clashes]] (2007)
: In 2007, the Dera Sacha Sauda leader [[Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh]] was accused of imitating the Sikh Guru Gobind Singh. The resulting controversy escalated to civil unrest in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi. Several people were killed in the clashes, and in 2008, there was an attempt to assassinate the Dera leader.{{sfn|Jacob Copeman|2012|p=156}}

== Politics ==

Various political parties, including the [[Shiromani Akali Dal]], and the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], and the [[Indian National Congress]], have patronized the deras to attract the Dalit [[vote bank]].{{sfn|Ashutosh Kumar|2014|pp=336-337}} During the election season, several political leaders and candidates visit the Deras, seeking support from the leaders of the various deras. This trend first became visible during the 1997 [[Punjab Legislative Assembly]] elections.{{sfn|Ashutosh Kumar|2014|p=335}}

The Akali Dal has openly sought electoral support from the Sikh deras. The Sant Samaj deras have openly supported Akali Dal.{{sfn|Ashutosh Kumar|2014|p=344}}

Among the non-Sikh deras, the [[Dera Sacha Sauda]] is influential in the [[Malwa, Punjab|Malwa]] region, and has a political wing. It has supported multiple political parties in various elections.{{sfn|Ashutosh Kumar|2014|pp=342-343}} The [[Dera Sach Khand]] asked its Dalit followers to vote for the [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] in [[Punjab Legislative Assembly election, 2012|2012 Punjab elections]], which was responsible for the dismal performance of the Congress in the [[Doaba]] region.{{sfn|Ashutosh Kumar|2014|p=343}} The [[Baba Bhaniara|Bhaniarwala Dera]] has not openly supported any political party, but disfavours the Akali Dal candidates. The Dera Beas (Radha Soami) has not openly supported any particular party either, but in the past it used to tilt towards the Congress. In the [[Punjab Legislative Assembly election, 2012|2012 Punjab elections]], it favoured the Akali Dal, after daughter of a former Dera chief married an Akali Dal leader.{{sfn|Ashutosh Kumar|2014|p=344}}

'''Donald McLean III''' (born October 2, 1945) is an American singer-songwriter. He is best known for his 1971 song "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]", which was a number-one US hit for four weeks in 1972 and stayed put at 2 for 3 weeks in the UK, as well as a hit for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in 2000. McLean's other well-known songs include: "[[And I Love You So (song)|And I Love You So]]", sung by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Perry Como]], [[Helen Reddy]], and [[Glen Campbell]], among others; "[[Vincent (song)|Vincent]]", a tribute to the 19th-century Dutch painter [[Vincent van Gogh]]; "[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]", a cover of the [[Roy Orbison]] song and a surprise number 1 hit in the United Kingdom in 1980; and "[[Castles in the Air (song)|Castles in the Air]]", which McLean recorded twice. In 2004, he was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].

==Musical roots==
McLean's grandfather and father, both also named Donald McLean, had roots originating in [[Scotland]]. The Buccis, the family of McLean's mother, Elizabeth, came from [[Abruzzo]] in [[central Italy]]. They left Italy and settled in [[Port Chester]], [[New York (state)|New York]], at the end of the 19th century. He has other extended family in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Boston]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite book|title=The Don McLean Story: Killing Us Softly With His Songs|last=Howard|first=Alan|year=2007|publisher=Lulu Press|isbn=978-1-4303-0682-5|page=420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though some of his early musical influences included [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Buddy Holly]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bye-Bye, Mr. 'American Pie': Don McLean Gives His Pen a Rest|last=Arnold|first=Thomas|date=March 23, 1990|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a teenager, McLean became interested in [[folk music]], particularly the [[the Weavers|Weavers]]' 1955 recording ''[[The Weavers at Carnegie Hall|At Carnegie Hall]]''. He often missed long periods of school because of childhood [[asthma]], particularly music lessons, and although McLean slipped back in his studies, his love of music was allowed to flourish. By age 16, he had bought his first guitar and began making contacts in the music business, becoming friends with the folk singers [[Erik Darling]] and [[Fred Hellerman]] of the Weavers. Hellerman said, "He called me one day and said, 'I'd like to come and visit you', and that's what he did! We became good friends — he has the most remarkable music memory of anyone I've ever known."&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

When McLean was 15, his father died. Fulfilling his father's request, the singer graduated from [[Iona Preparatory School]] in 1963,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; and briefly attended [[Villanova University]], dropping out after four months. After leaving Villanova, McLean became associated with the famed [[folk music]] agent [[Harold Leventhal]] for several months before teaming up with his personal manager, Herb Gart, for 18 years. For the next six years he performed at venues and events including [[The Bitter End]] and the [[the Gaslight Cafe|Gaslight Cafe]] in New York, the [[Newport Folk Festival]], the [[the Cellar Door|Cellar Door]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[the Troubadour (Los Angeles)|Troubadour]] in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He attended [[night school]] at [[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]] and received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[business administration]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://don-mclean.com/2013/08/12/about-don-mclean/|title=About Don McLean|date=August 12, 2013|work=Don McLean|access-date=February 25, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He turned down a scholarship to [[Columbia University]] Graduate School in favor of pursuing a career as a [[singer-songwriter]], performing at such venues as [[Caffè Lena]] in, [[Saratoga Springs, New York]], and the [[The Main Point|Main Point]], in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]].

Later that year, with the help of a grant from the [[New York State Council on the Arts]], McLean began reaching a wider audience, with visits to towns up and down the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He learned the art of performing from his friend and mentor [[Pete Seeger]]. McLean accompanied Seeger on his [[Sloop Clearwater|Clearwater]] boat trip up the Hudson River in 1969 to raise awareness about environmental pollution in the river. During this time McLean wrote songs that would appear on his first album, ''[[Tapestry (Don McLean album)|Tapestry]]''. McLean co-edited the book ''Songs and Sketches of the First Clearwater Crew'', with sketches by [[Thomas B. Allen (painter)|Thomas B. Allen]], for which Pete Seeger wrote the foreword. Seeger and McLean sang "[[Oh Shenandoah|Shenandoah]]" on the 1974 Clearwater album.

==Recording career==
{{BLP sources section|date=December 2016}}

===Early breakthrough===
McLean recorded ''Tapestry'' in 1969 in [[Berkeley, California]], during the student riots.  After being rejected 72 times by labels, the album was released by [[Mediarts]], a label that had not existed when he first started to look for a label. He worked on the album for a couple of years before putting it out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/don-mclean-interview-2017.htm|title=Special Interview With Don McLean, Renowned Singer/Songwriter Of "American Pie" and Other Classic Songs|date=July 3, 2017|work=Songwriter Universe {{!}} Songwriting News, Articles &amp; Song Contest|access-date=February 25, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attracted good reviews but little notice outside the folk community, though on the Easy Listening chart "[[Castles in the Air (song)|Castles in the Air]]" was a success, and in 1973 "And I Love You So" became a number 1 Adult Contemporary hit for [[Perry Como]].

McLean's major break came when Mediarts was taken over by [[United Artists Records]], thus securing the promotion of a major label for his second album, ''[[American Pie (Don McLean album)|American Pie]].''  The album launched two number one hits in the title song and "[[Vincent (song)|Vincent]]". ''American Pie''&amp;#39;s success made McLean an international star and piqued interest in his first album, which charted more than two years after its initial release.

==="American Pie"===
{{Main|American Pie (song)}}
McLean's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]", is a sprawling, impressionistic ballad inspired partly by the deaths of [[Buddy Holly]], [[Ritchie Valens]], and J.P. Richardson ([[The Big Bopper]]) in a plane crash in 1959, and developments in American youth culture in the subsequent decade. The song popularized the expression "[[The Day the Music Died]]" in reference to the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonMcLean?from=Main.DonMcLean|title=Don McLean (Music)|publisher=TV Tropes|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was recorded on May 26, 1971, and a month later received its first radio airplay on New York's WNEW-FM and WPLJ-FM to mark the closing of [[Fillmore East]], the famous New York concert hall.  "American Pie" reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] from January 15 to February 5, 1972, and remains McLean's most successful single release. The single also topped the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Easy Listening]] chart. With a total running time of 8:36 encompassing both sides of the single, it is also the longest song to reach number 1. Some stations played only part one of the original split-sided single release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1193|title=American Pie by Don McLean Songfacts|website=www.songfacts.com|language=en|access-date=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]] DJ Bob Dearborn unraveled the lyrics and first published his interpretation on January 7, 1972, eight days before the song reached number 1 nationally (see "Further reading" under [[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]). Numerous other interpretations, which together largely converged on Dearborn's interpretation, quickly followed. McLean declined to say anything definitive about the lyrics until 1978.&lt;ref&gt;However, [[Casey Kasem]] confirmed the main outline of what Dearborn had said and seemed to indicate that McLean agreed with that outline, on the January 15, 1972, edition of ''[[American Top 40]]'', when "American Pie" had just ascended to number 1 on the Hot 100.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then McLean has stated that the lyrics are also somewhat autobiographical and present an abstract story of his life from the mid-1950s until the time he wrote the song in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.don-mclean.com/americanpie.asp|title=Don McLean's American Pie|work=Don McLean Online - The Official Website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222185354/http://www.don-mclean.com/americanpie.asp|archivedate=December 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 "American Pie" was voted number 5 in a poll of the 365 [[Songs of the Century]] compiled by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].

On April 7, 2015, McLean’s original working manuscript for "American Pie" sold for $1,205,000 (£809,524/€1,109,182) at Christie’s auction rooms, New York, making it the third highest auction price achieved for an American literary manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/salelanding/index.aspx?intSaleID=25290|title=Don McLean's "American Pie": The Original Lyrics|publisher=Christies.com|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent recordings===
[[File:Don McLean 1976.JPG|thumb|McLean in a publicity photo, 1976]]
Personnel from the ''[[American Pie (Don McLean album)|American Pie]]'' album sessions were retained for his third album, ''[[Don McLean (album)|Don McLean]]'', including the producer, Ed Freeman, [[Rob Stoner|Rob Rothstein]] on bass and [[Warren Bernhardt]] on piano. The song "The Pride Parade" provides an insight into McLean's immediate reaction to stardom. McLean told ''[[Melody Maker]]'' magazine in 1973 that ''Tapestry'' was an album by someone previously concerned with external situations. ''[[American Pie (Don McLean album)|American Pie]]'' combines externals with internals and the resultant success of that album makes the third one (''[[Don McLean (album)|Don McLean]]'') entirely introspective."

Other songs written by McLean for the album include "Dreidel" (number 21 on the Billboard chart) and "If We Try" (number 58), which was subsequently recorded by [[Olivia Newton-John]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Great Olivia Newton-John]]'', Festival Records, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; "On the Amazon" from the 1920s musical [[Mr Cinders]] was an unusual choice but became an audience favorite in concerts and featured in ''Till Tomorrow'', a documentary film about McLean produced by Bob Elfstrom (Elfstrom held the role of Jesus Christ in Johnny and June Cash's ''Gospel Road)''. The film shows McLean in concert at Columbia University as he was interrupted by a bomb scare. He left the stage while the audience stood up and checked under their seats for anything that resembled a bomb. After the all-clear, McLean re-appeared and sang "On the Amazon" from exactly where he had left off. Don Heckman reported the bomb scare in his review for ''The New York Times'' entitled "Don McLean Survives Two Obstacles."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', December 12, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth album, ''[[Playin' Favorites]]'' was a top-40 hit in the UK in 1973 and included the Irish folk classic, "Mountains of Mourne" and [[Buddy Holly]]'s "[[Everyday (Buddy Holly song)|Everyday]]", a live rendition of which returned McLean to the [[UK Singles Chart]]. McLean said, "The last album (''[[Don McLean (album)|Don McLean]]'') was a study in depression whereas the new one (''[[Playin' Favorites]]'') is almost the quintessence of optimism."

The 1974 album ''[[Homeless Brother]]'', produced by [[Joel Dorn]], was McLean's final studio recording for United Artists. The album featured fine New York session musicians, including Ralph McDonald on percussion, [[Hugh McCracken]] on guitar and a guest appearance by [[Yusef Lateef]] on flute. The [[The Persuasions|Persuasions]] sang the background vocals on "Crying in the Chapel", and [[Cissy Houston]] provided a backing vocal on "La La Love You". The album's title song was inspired by [[Jack Kerouac]]'s book ''[[Lonesome Traveler]]'', in which Kerouac tells the story of America's "homeless brothers", or hobos. The song features background vocals by [[Pete Seeger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/homeless-brother-mw0000046874|title=Homeless Brother: Don McLean {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "The Legend of Andrew McCrew" was based on an article published in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; concerning a black Dallas hobo named Anderson McCrew who was killed when he leapt from a moving train. No one claimed him, so a carnival took his body, mummified it, and toured all over the South with him, calling him "The Famous Mummy Man." McLean's song inspired radio station WGN in Chicago to tell the story and give the song airplay in order to raise money for a headstone for McCrew's grave. Their campaign was successful, and McCrew's body was exhumed and buried in the Lincoln Cemetery in Dallas.&lt;ref&gt;''Ellensburg Daily Record'', May 24, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; The tombstone had an inscription with words from the fourth verse of McLean's song:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What a way to live a life, and what a way to die&lt;br/&gt;
Left to live a living death with no one left to cry&lt;br/&gt;
A petrified amazement, a wonder beyond worth&lt;br/&gt;
A man who found more life in death than life gave him at birth&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Joel Dorn]] later collaborated on the McLean career retrospective ''[[Rearview Mirror: An American Musical Journey|Rearview Mirror]]'', released in 2005 on Dorn's label, Hyena Records. In 2006, Dorn reflected on working with McLean:&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the more than 200 studio albums I've produced in the past forty plus years, there is a handful; maybe fifteen or so that I can actually listen to from top to bottom. ''[[Homeless Brother]]'' is one of them. It accomplished everything I set out to do. And it did so because it was a true collaboration. Don brought so much to the project that all I really had to do was capture what he did, and complement it properly when necessary.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1977 a brief liaison with [[Arista Records]] that yielded the album ''[[Prime Time (Don McLean album)|Prime Time]]'' and, in October 1978, the single "It Doesn't Matter Anymore". This was a track from the album ''[[Chain Lightning (album)|Chain Lightning]]'' that should have been the second of four with Arista.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; McLean had started recording in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], with [[Elvis Presley]]'s backing singers, the [[The Jordanaires|Jordanaires]], and many of Presey's musicians. However the Arista deal broke down following artistic disagreements between McLean and the Arista chief, [[Clive Davis]]. Consequently, McLean was left without a record contract in the United States, but through continuing deals, ''[[Chain Lightning (album)|Chain Lightning]]'' was released by EMI in Europe and by Festival Records in Australia.

In April 1980, the Roy Orbison song "[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]" from the album began picking up airplay on Dutch radio stations and McLean was called to Europe to appear on several important musical variety shows to plug the song and support its release as a single by EMI. The song achieved number 1 status in the Netherlands first, followed by the UK and then Australia.

McLean's number 1 successes in Europe and Australia led to a new deal in the United States with Millennium Records, which issued ''[[Chain Lightning (album)|Chain Lightning]]'' two and a half years after it had been recorded in Nashville and two years after its release in Europe. It charted on February 14, 1981, and reached number 28, while "[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]" climbed to number 5 on the pop singles chart. Orbison himself thought that McLean’s version was the best interpretation he’d ever heard of one of his songs. Orbison thought McLean did a better job than he did and even went so far as to say that the voice of Don McLean is one of the great instruments of 20th-century America.&lt;ref name=skydoc&gt;{{cite AV media|title=Don McLean: An American Troubadour|medium=Television production|publisher=Sky Arts 1|location=UK|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, "McLean's voice could cut through steel - he is a very pure singer and he's up there with the best of them. He's a very talented singer and songwriter and he deserves his success."&lt;ref name=skydoc/&gt;

McLean had further chart successes in the United States in the early 1980s with "[[Since I Don't Have You]]", a new recording of "Castles in the Air" and "It's Just the Sun". In 1987, the release of the country-based album''[[Love Tracks (Don McLean album)|Love Tracks]]'' gave rise to the hit singles "Love in My Heart" (a top-10 in Australia), "[[You Can't Blame the Train]]" (U.S. country number 49), and "Eventually". The latter two songs were written by [[Houston]] native [[Terri Sharp]]. In 1991, [[EMI]] reissued "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]" as a single in the United Kingdom, and McLean performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. In 1992, previously unreleased songs became available on ''[[Favorites and Rarities]]'', while ''Don McLean Classics'' featured new studio recordings of "[[Vincent (song)|Vincent]]" and "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]".

McLean has continued to record new material, including ''River of Love'' in 1995 on [[Curb Records]] and, more recently, the albums ''You've Got to Share'', ''Don McLean Sings Marty Robbins'' and ''The Western Album'' for his own Don McLean Music label. ''Addicted to Black'' was released in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.don-mclean.com/?p=320 |title=Don McLean Online |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123224947/http://www.don-mclean.com/?p=320|archivedate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other songs===
McLean's other well-known songs include the following.
*"[[And I Love You So (song)|And I Love You So]]" was recorded by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Helen Reddy]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], [[Howard Keel]], [[Claude François]], and a [[1973 in music|1973 hit]] for [[Perry Como]].
*"[[Vincent (song)|Vincent]]", a tribute to the 19th-century Dutch painter, [[Vincent van Gogh]]. Although it reached only number 12 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, it proved to be a huge hit worldwide, including reaching number 1 in the UK Singles Chart. [[Mike Mills]] of REM said, "You can't change a note in that song".&lt;ref name=skydoc/&gt; The song was performed by [[NOFX]] on their album ''45 or 46 Songs That Weren't Good Enough to Go on Our Other Records'' and also appears on the [[Fat Wreck Chords]] compilation ''Survival of the Fattest''. "Vincent" was also sung by [[Josh Groban]] on his [[Josh Groban (album)|2001 debut album]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joshgroban.com/node/78|title=Official Website For Josh Groban|publisher=Joshgroban.com|date=February 24, 2007|accessdate=August 25, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181718/http://www.joshgroban.com/node/78|archivedate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"[[Castles in the Air (song)|Castles in the Air]]", which McLean recorded twice. His 1981 re-recording was a top-40 hit, reaching number 36 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in late 1981.&lt;ref name="Whitburn"&gt;[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (2004). ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', 8th edition. (Billboard Publications). p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"[[Wonderful Baby]]", a tribute to [[Fred Astaire]] that Astaire himself recorded. Primarily rejected by pop stations, it reached number 1 on the ''Billboard'' Easy Listening chart.&lt;ref&gt;Hyatt, Wesley (1999). ''The Billboard Book of #1 Adult Contemporary Hits''. Billboard Publications. p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Superman's Ghost", a tribute to [[George Reeves]], who portrayed [[Superman]] on television in the 1950s.
*"The Grave", a song that McLean had written about the [[Vietnam War]], was recorded by [[George Michael]] in 2003 in protest against the Iraq War.

The ''American Pie'' album features a version of [[Psalm 137]], entitled "Babylon". The song is based on a canon by [[Philip Hayes (composer)|Philip Hayes]]&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Philip. ''The Muses Delight: Catches, Glees, Canzonets and Canons''. London, 1786.&lt;/ref&gt; and was arranged by McLean and [[Lee Hays]] (of The Weavers).&lt;ref&gt;''American Pie'' album song credits&lt;/ref&gt; "Babylon" was performed in the ''[[Mad Men]]'' [[Babylon (Mad Men episode)|episode of the same name]] despite the fact that the song would not be released until 10 years after the time in which the episode is set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/mad-men-fridays-season-1-episode-6-babylon|title=Mad Men Recap: Season 1, Episode 6, "Babylon" {{!}} The House Next Door {{!}} Slant Magazine|work=Slant Magazine|access-date=February 25, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, McLean had an international number one hit with a version of the [[Roy Orbison]] classic "[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]". It was only after the record became a success overseas that it was released in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Don-McLean-Crying/release/751196|title=Don McLean - Crying|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single hit reached number 5 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in 1981.&lt;ref name="Whitburn"/&gt; Orbison himself once described McLean as "the voice of the century",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festivalsearcher.com/artists.aspx?artist_id=Don_McLean|title=Don McLean Live Tour Festivals 2015|publisher=Festivalsearcher.com|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a subsequent re-recording of the song, Orbison incorporated elements of McLean's version.

For the 1982 animated cult movie ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]'', produced by [[Jules Bass]] and [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]], McLean sang the opening theme. However, no soundtrack has ever been released. Another hit song associated with McLean (though never recorded by him) is "[[Killing Me Softly with His Song]]", which was claimed by [[Lori Lieberman]] to have been written McLean after she, also a singer-songwriter, saw him singing his composition "Empty Chairs" in concert.&lt;ref name="Daily News"&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Haire |first=Patricia |url=http://www.don-mclean.com/i/kill.jpg |title=A Killer of a Song |newspaper=Daily News |location=New York |date=April 5, 1973 |page=6 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514165758/http://www.don-mclean.com/i/kill.jpg |archivedate=May 14, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards (according to Lieberman) she wrote a poem about the experience and shared it with [[Norman Gimbel]], who had long been searching for a way to use a phrase he had copied from a novel badly translated from Spanish to English, "killing me softly with his blues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Sheila|title=The Craft of Lyric Writing|publisher=Writers Digest Books|year=1984|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uVePZ1Qwtb0C&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=September 22, 2010|isbn=0-89879-149-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Allegedly, Gimbel and [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]] reworked the poem and the phrase into the song "Killing Me Softly with His Song",&lt;ref name="Billboard Magazine 1974. Page 53"&gt;''Billboard'' magazine, June 22, 1974, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; originally recorded by Lieberman and later by [[Roberta Flack]] (and also later recorded by the [[The Fugees|Fugees]]). This claim was disputed, notably by Fox. Subsequently, however, the matter reached an unequivocal conclusion when contemporaneous articles from the early 1970s were exhumed, all of them vindicating Lieberman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/02/arts/l-the-true-source-of-killing-me-softly-836680.html|title=The True Source Of 'Killing Me Softly'|date=March 2, 1997|work=New York Times|access-date=February 25, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 5, 1973, article in the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', Norman Gimbel was quoted as follows: "She [Lori Lieberman] told us about this strong experience she had listening to McLean ("I felt all flushed with fever / Embarrassed by the crowd / I felt he had found my letters / And read each one out loud / I prayed that he would finish / But he just kept right on…"). I had a notion this might make a good song so the three of us discussed it. We talked it over several times, just as we did for the rest of the numbers we wrote for this album and we all felt it had possibilities."&lt;ref name="Daily News"/&gt;

==Concerts==
[[File:Don McLean at the NYCB Theatre at Westbury 2013-07-13 3.jpg|thumb|McLean at the [[NYCB Theatre at Westbury]] in July 2013]]
McLean's albums did not match the commercial success of ''[[American Pie (Don McLean album)|American Pie]]'', but he became a major concert attraction in the United States and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/14517/don-mclean/|title=Don McLean {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|website=www.officialcharts.com|language=en|access-date=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His repertoire included old concert hall numbers and the catalogues of singers such as [[Buddy Holly]], and another McLean influence, [[Frank Sinatra]]. The years spent playing gigs in small clubs and coffee houses in the 1960s transformed into well-paced performances. McLean's first concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]], in New York, and the [[Albert Hall]] in London, in 1972 were critically acclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/maguire/donarchive/lincoln.html|title=First ever UK Concert Appearances|website=myweb.tiscali.co.uk|access-date=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years McLean has continued to tour the United States, Canada and Europe (2011, 2012) and Australia (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.don-mclean.com|title=Don McLean Online — The Official Website of Don McLean and American Pie|publisher=Don-mclean.com|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011 McLean appeared at the [[Glastonbury Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/festivals/glastonbury/2011/artists/donmclean|title=BBC Glastonbury Festival|publisher=BBC|date=June 26, 2011|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Pilton, Somerset|Pilton]], UK, and in 2014 at California's [[Stagecoach Festival|Stagecoach Country Music Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/events/20140427/stagecoach-2014-don-mclean-performs-emotional-set-for-fans-celebs-ashton-kutcher-and-mila-kunis|title=Stagecoach 2014: Don McLean Performs Emotional Set for Fans, Celebs Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis|publisher=Dailynews.com|date=April 27, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, McLean undertook his 20th nationwide tour of the UK and Ireland. 
[[File:McLean Concert Brochure.jpg|thumb|McLean's autograph from a 1996 concert in Albuquerque, New Mexico.]]

==Later work and honors==
In 1991, McLean returned to the UK top 20 with a re-issue of "American Pie".

[[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]] conferred an honorary doctorate on him in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iona College|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/iona-college-2737|publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2002, "American Pie" was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/hall-of-fame|title=Grammy Hall of Fame|website=The Grammys|language=en|access-date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, McLean was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. Garth Brooks presented the award and said, "Don McLean: his work, like the man himself, is very deep and very compassionate. His pop anthem 'American Pie' is a cultural phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/08/gloomy-don-mclean-reveals-meaning-of-american-pie-and-sells-lyrics-for-1-2-million/|title=Gloomy Don McLean Reveals Meaning of ‘American Pie’ — and Sells Lyrics for $1.2 Million|website=Washington Post|access-date=February 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, Brooks repaid the favor by appearing as a guest (with [[Nanci Griffith]]) on McLean's first American TV special, broadcast as the [[PBS]] program ''Starry Starry Night''.  A month later, McLean wound up the 20th century by performing "American Pie" at the Lincoln Memorial Gala in [[Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C337|title=Songwriters Hall of Fame: Don McLean Exhibit Home|website=www.songwritershalloffame.org|access-date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biography ''The Don McLean Story: Killing Us Softly With His Songs'' was published in 2007.  Biographer Alan Howard conducted extensive interviews for this, the only book-length biography of the often reclusive McLean to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alanhowardinfo.wordpress.com/don-mclean/|title=The Don McLean Story|date=November 2, 2016|work=Dr Alan Howard|access-date=February 25, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012 McLean won the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards Life Time Achievement award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/events/folk-awards-2012|title=Radio 2 - Events - Radio 2 Folk Awards 2012|publisher=BBC|date=February 8, 2012|accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, the PBS network broadcast a feature-length documentary about the life and music of McLean called "Don McLean: American Troubadour" produced by four-time Emmy Award-winning filmmaker [[Jim Brown (director)|Jim Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2012/jan/06/don-mclean-american-troubadour/ |title=Don McLean: American Troubadour |date=November 6, 2012 |website=KPBS.org |access-date=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLean is one of the primary influences on the UK singer-songwriter [[Jake Bugg]], who said McLean's song "[[Vincent (song)|Vincent]]" was "the first song I liked" after hearing it on an episode of The Simpsons. He devoured McLean's back catalogue and then delved into the artists that inspired McLean, including Buddy Holly and the Weavers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jake Bugg: I have to Pinch Myself|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19923871|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tupac Shakur]] also cited McLean's "[[Vincent (song)|Vincent]]" as a personal inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tupac Shakur: Biography|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000637/bio|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLean is credited as the writer of [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]]'s song "Doing It Wrong", featuring Stevie Wonder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doing it Wrong|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/doing-it-wrong-mt0042497323/lyrics|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song includes lyrics from two McLean compositions – "The Wrong Thing to Do" and "When a Good Thing Goes Bad" – both of which were featured on his 1977 album ''[[Prime Time (Don McLean album)|Prime Time]]''.

In March 2017, McLean's single "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]" was designated an "aural treasure" by the Library of Congress, "worthy of preservation" in the National Recording Registry "as part of America’s patrimony".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-029/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
McLean was raised in the [[Roman Catholic]] faith of his mother, Elizabeth McLean; his father, Donald McLean, was a Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepaulleslie.com/don-mclean/?mobile=1|title=Don McLean: Legendary Singer-Songwriter|publisher=Paul Leslie|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When McLean was 15, his father died months after their only vacation, to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://don-mclean.com/2013/08/12/about-don-mclean|title=About Don McLean|date=August 12, 2013|work=Don McLean|access-date=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Five Strengths''' ([[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]]: ''{{IAST|pañcabalāni}}'') in Buddhism are [[Saddha|faith]], [[Viriya|energy]], [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]], [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|concentration]], and [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]].  They are one of the seven sets of "[[Bodhipakkhiyadhamma|qualities conducive to enlightenment]]." They are parallel facets of the five "[[Indriya|spiritual faculties]]."

==Translation==
''Pañca'' (Sanskrit, Pali) means "five."&lt;ref&gt;See Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 387, entry for "Pañca," retrieved 2008-03-11 from "U. of Chicago" at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:971.pali; and, Monier-Williams (1964), e.g., p. 579, entry "Pañcaka," retrieved 2008-03-11 from "U. of Cologne" at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/MWScanpdf/mw0578-paJcAGguri.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bala'' (Sanskrit, Pali) means "power," "strength," "force."&lt;ref&gt;See Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 482, entry for "Bala," retrieved 2008-03-11 from "U. of Chicago" at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:3245.pali; and, Monier-Williams (1964), p. 722, entry "Bala," retrieved 2008-03-11 from "U. of Cologne" at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0722-barAsI.jpg.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exegesis==
Faith and Wisdom balance each other, as do Energy and Concentration.
The Five Faculties are ‘controlling' faculties because they control or master their opposites.
The faculties and powers are two aspects of the same thing.

#Faith/Conviction ([[Faith in Buddhism|saddhā]] bala) - controls doubt
#Energy/Effort/Persistence ([[Vīrya|viriya]] bala) – controls laziness
#Mindfulness ([[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]] bala) - controls heedlessness
#Concentration ([[Samadhi|samādhi]] bala) - controls distraction
#Wisdom/Discernment ([[Prajñā (Buddhism)|paññā]] bala) – controls ignorance

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1974">'''Francis Xavier "Frank" Macek Andre''' (July 20, 1888 &amp;ndash; January 16, 1959) was a purported faith healer, known as "The goat doctor of the Sierras."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goats are Gonna Save Us|url=http://squidleader.blogspot.com/2007/09/goats-are-gonna-save-us.html|website=Squid Leader|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Born in [[Vienna, Austria]], Andre was orphaned at the age of six when his parents died in [[Czechoslovakia]]. He came to [[California]] as a young man in 1911 after his adoption by Ernest Frank Andre (1865-1961) and Anna Elizabeth Raker Andre (1865-1948).

He opened his controversial medical practice in 1921, conducting sessions barefoot because, in his words, "you contact the soil directly and get health giving powers from the good earth" and with hair reaching to his shoulders because "if you cut it, it diminishes the power."

"I don't claim to cure anyone," Andre said, "I tell those who need medical treatment to see a doctor. My treatment is mostly a form of chiropractic adjust." His fee was the same to all — a flat $3.

His nickname, "Goat Doctor", came from his herd of goats, kept near his mountain cabin about eight miles north of [[Placerville, California|Placerville]], near the area later called [[Swansboro, California|Swansboro]]. After he died, much of the proceeds of his practice were found, buried, on Andre's land by famed treasure seeker James A. Normandi (a.k.a. Jimmy Sierra). Coins from the "Goat Doctor Cache" command a premium with history collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coin, Gold Hunters Treasure Their Hobby|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/101468/COIN-GOLD-HUNTERS-TREASURE-THEIR-HOBBY.html?pg=all|website=Deseret News|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hilma af Klint''' (October 26, 1862 – October 21, 1944) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[artist]] and [[mysticism|mystic]] whose paintings were amongst the first [[abstract art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-first-abstract-artwork|last1=Cain|first1=Abigail|title=''What Was the First Abstract Artwork?''|work=Artsy.net|access-date=2017-03-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A considerable body of her abstract work predates the first purely abstract compositions by [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]].&lt;ref name=TATE&gt;{{cite web|last1=Voss|first1=Julia|title=The first abstract artist? (And it's not Kandinsky)|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/first-abstract-artist-and-its-not-kandinsky|website=www.tate.org.uk|publisher=Tate Modern|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She belonged to a group called "The Five", a circle of women who shared her belief in the importance of trying to make contact with the so-called "High Masters" – often by way of séances. Her paintings, which sometimes resemble diagrams, were a visual representation of complex spiritual ideas.

== Early life ==
[[File:Eftersommar Hilma af Klint 1903.jpeg|thumb|''Eftersommar'' (''Late Summer'') an early naturalistic work, painted by af Klint in 1903. An example of the works she exhibited to the public during her lifetime.]] 
The fourth child of Captain Victor af Klint, a Swedish naval commander, and Mathilda af Klint (née Sonntag), Hilma af Klint spent summers with her family at their manor Hanmora on the island of [[Adelsö]] in [[Lake Mälaren]]. In these idyllic surroundings Hilma came into contact with nature at an early stage in her life; and this deep association with natural forms was to be an inspiration in her work. Later in life, Hilma af Klint came to live on a permanent basis at Munsö, an island next to Adelsö.

From her family, Hilma af Klint inherited a great interest for [[mathematics]] and [[botany]]. She showed an early ability in visual art, and after the family moved to Stockholm, she studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts]] of Stockholm (Konstakademien), where she learned portraiture and landscape painting.
She was admitted at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts at the age of twenty. During the years 1882–1887 she studied mainly drawing, and portrait- and landscape painting. She graduated with honors, and was allocated a scholarship in the form of a studio in the so-called "Atelier Building" (Ateljébyggnaden), owned by The Academy of Fine Arts in the crossing between [[Hamngatan]] and [[Kungsträdgården]] in central Stockholm. This was the main cultural hub in the Swedish capital at that time. The same building also held [[Blanch's Café]] and Blanchs Art Gallery, where the conflict stood between the conventional art view of the Academy of Fine Arts, and the opposition movement of the "Art Society" (Konstnärsförbundet), inspired by the French [[En plein air|En Plein Air]] painters.
Hilma af Klint began working in Stockholm, gaining recognition for her landscapes, botanical drawings, and portraits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/hilma-af-klint-painting-unseen|title=Hilma af Klint: Painting the Unseen|work=Serpentine Galleries|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her conventional painting became the source of financial income. But her 'life's work' remained a quite separate practice.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Spiritual and philosophical ideas ==
In 1880 her younger sister Hermina died, and it was at this time that the spiritual dimension of her life began to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/21/hilma-af-klint-occult-spiritualism-abstract-serpentine-gallery|title=Hilma af Klint: a painter possessed|last=Kellaway|first=Kate|date=2016-02-21|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her interest in abstraction and symbolism came from Hilma af Klint's involvement in [[spiritism]], very much in vogue at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. Hilma af Klint became interested in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] of [[Madame Blavatsky]] and the philosophy of [[Christian Rosencreutz]]. In 1908 she met [[Rudolf Steiner]], the founder of the [[Anthroposophical Society]], who was on a visit to Stockholm. Rudolf Steiner initiated her in his own theories regarding the Arts, and would have a certain influence on her paintings later in life. Several years later, in 1920, she met him again at the Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland, the headquarters of the Anthroposophical Society. Between 1921 and 1930 she  spent long periods at the Goetheanum.

Af Klint's work can be understood in the wider context of the [[Modernism|Modernist]] search for new forms in artistic, spiritual, political and scientific systems at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Taft –  ''[http://www.thenationalstudent.com/Arts_and_Theatre/2017-04-19/invisible_art_rediscovering_the_work_of_hilma_af_klint.html Invisible art: rediscovering the work of Hilma af Klint]'' National Student, April 19, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 
One will find the same interest in spirituality in other artists during this same period, such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Kasimir Malevitch]] and the French [[Les Nabis|Nabis]] of which many were, like af Klint, inspired by the [[Theosophical Society|Theosophical Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theosophyforward.com/articles/theosophy-and-the-society-in-the-public-eye/1138-hilma-af-klint/ Theosophy and the Society in the Public Eye ]&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, the artistic transition to abstract art and the non figurative painting of Hilma af Klint would occur without any contacts with the contemporary modern movements.

The works of Hilma af Klint are mainly spiritual, and her artistic work is a consequence of this.&lt;ref&gt;[Hilma af Klint – Painting the Unseen Serpentine Galleries, 2016. {{ISBN|978-1-908617-34-7}}, p.24]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
[[File:Hilma af Klint Svanen.jpg|thumb|''Svanen'' (''The Swan''), nr 17, Group 9, Series SUW, October 1914 – March 1915. This abstract work was never exhibited during af Klint's lifetime.]]

At the Academy of Fine Arts she met [[Anna Cassel]], the first of the four women with whom she later worked in "The Five" (''de Fem''), a group of artists who shared her ideas. The group of female artists ''The Five'' was engaged in the paranormal and regularly organized spiritistic séances. They recorded in a book a completely new system of mystical thoughts in the form of messages from higher spirits, called ''The High Masters'' ("Höga Mästare"). One, Gregor, spoke thus: "all the knowledge that is not of the senses, not of the intellect, not of the heart but is the property that exclusively belongs to the deepest aspect of your being...the knowledge of your spirit".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Through her work with the group ''The Five'' Hilma af Klint created experimental [[automatic drawing]] as early as 1896, leading her towards an inventive geometric [[visual language]] capable of conceptualizing invisible forces both of the inner and outer worlds.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
As she got more familiar with this form of expression, Hilma af Klint was assigned by the High Masters to create the paintings for the "Temple" – however she never understood what this "Temple" referred to.
Hilma af Klint felt she was being directed by a force that would literally guide her hand. She wrote in her notebook :

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The pictures were painted directly through me, without any preliminary drawings, and with great force. I had no idea what the paintings were supposed to depict; nevertheless I worked swiftly and surely, without changing a single brush stroke.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modernamuseet.se/stockholm/en/exhibitions/hilma-af-klint-2/topics/ Iris Müller-Westermann – Paintings for the Temple – Moderna Museet Stockholm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1906, after 20 years of artistic works, and at the age of 44, Hilma af Klint painted her first series of abstract paintings.

The work for the Temple ran between 1906 and 1915, carried out in two phases with an interruption between 1908 and 1912. 
As Hilma af Klint discovered her new form of visual expression, she developed a new artistic language. Her painting became more autonomous and more intentional. The spiritual would however continue being the main source of creativity throughout the rest of her life.

The collection for the Temple counts in total 193 paintings, grouped in several sub-series. The major paintings, dated 1907, are extremely large in size : each painting measures approximately 2,40 x 3,20m. This series, called ''The Ten Largest'', describes the different phases in life, from early childhood to old age.

Quite apart from their diagrammatic purpose the paintings have a freshness and a modern aesthetic of tentative line and hastily captured image: a segmented circle, a helix bisected and divided into a spectrum of lightly painted colors.
The artistic world of Hilma af Klint is impregnated with symbols, letters and words. The paintings often depicts symmetrical dualities, or reciprocities : up and down, in and out, earthly and esoteric, male and female, good and evil. The colour choice is throughout metaphorical: blue stands for the female spirit, yellow for the male one, and pink / red for physical / spiritual love. ''The Swan'' and ''the Dove'', names of two series of the ''Paintings for the Temple'', are also symbolic, representing respectively transcendence and love. As gates to other dimensions, her paintings call for interpretation on a narrative, esoterically and artistic level.

When Hilma af Klint had completed the works for the Temple, the spiritual guidance ended. However, she pursued abstract painting, now independently from any external influence. If the paintings for the Temple were mostly oil paintings, she now also used aquarelle. Her later paintings are significantly smaller in size. She painted among others a series depicting the stand-points of different religions at various stages in history, as well as representations of the duality between the physical being and its equivalence on an esoteric level. As Hilma af Klint pursued her artistic and esoteric research, it is possible to perceive a certain inspiration from the artistic theories developed by the Anthroposophical Society from 1920 onward.

All through her life, Hilma af Klint would seek to understand the mysteries that she had come in contact with through her work. She left behind more than 150 notebooks with her thoughts and studies.&lt;ref name=WITT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Witt|first1=Karolina|title=Hilma af Klint Tempelbilderna och historieskrivningen |url=http://www.diva-portal.se/smash/get/diva2:306945/FULLTEXT01.pdf|website=www.diva-portal.org|publisher=Halmstad University|accessdate=4 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilma af Klint never dared to show her abstract work to her contemporaries. Her major work, the one dedicated to the Temple, had been questioned and rejected by Rudolf Steiner. Hilma af Klint drew the conclusion that her time was not yet ready to understand them. More than 1200 paintings and drawings were carefully stored away in her atelier, waiting for the future.

Hilma af Klint died in 1944, nearly 82 years old, in the aftermath of a traffic accident.

== Legacy ==
In her will, Hilma af Klint left all her abstract paintings to her nephew, vice-admiral in the Swedish Royal Navy. She specified that her work should be kept secret for at least 20 years after her death. When the boxes were opened at the end of the 1960s, very few persons had knowledge of what would be revealed.

In 1970 her paintings were offered as a gift to [[Moderna Museet]] in Stockholm, which declined the donation. Thanks to the art historian Åke Fant, her art was introduced to an international audience in the 1980s, when he presented her at a [[Nordik]] conference in [[Helsinki]] in 1984. Erik af Klint then donated thousands of drawings and paintings to a foundation bearing the artist's name in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Clemens Bomsdorf (April 13, 2017), [http://theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/museum-to-honour-pioneer-of-abstraction-stuck-in-limbo/ Museum for pioneer of abstraction Hilma af Klint is stuck in limbo] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection of abstract paintings of Hilma af Klint counts more than 1200 pieces. It is owned and managed by the Hilma af Klint Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hilmaafklint.se/ Foundation Hilma af Klint]&lt;/ref&gt; in Stockholm, Sweden. In 2017, Norwegian architectural firm [[Snøhetta (company)|Snøhetta]] presented plans for an exhibition centre dedicated to af Klint in [[Järna, Södertälje Municipality|Järna]], south of Stockholm, with estimated building costs of between €6 million and €7.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Clemens Bomsdorf (April 13, 2017), [http://theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/museum-to-honour-pioneer-of-abstraction-stuck-in-limbo/ Museum for pioneer of abstraction Hilma af Klint is stuck in limbo] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, the Foundation signed a long-term agreement of cooperation with the Moderna Museet, thereby confirming the perenity of the Hilma af Klint Room, i.e. a dedicated space at the museum where a dozen works of the artist are shown on a continuous basis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.modernamuseet.se/stockholm/en/2018/02/26/hilma-af-klint-moderna-museet/ More Hilma af Klint at Moderna Museet], 26 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The European colonial powers banned slave capture and trading in the first half of the 19th century, with the British Empire banning it in the early decades. However, the demand kept rising for low cost, high intensity labor in colonial plantations of sugarcane, cotton, tobacco and other cash crops. The British Empire substituted the slave labor supplies from Africa with indentured labor supplies from India.&lt;ref name="Younger2009p4"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Younger|title=New Homelands: Hindu Communities in Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad, South Africa, Fiji, and East Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0X9eLq57ocC |year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-974192-2|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Vertovik (Robin Cohen, ed.)|title=The Cambridge survey of world migration| year=1995| pages=57–68|isbn=978-0-521-44405-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indentured people brought from India included primarily Hindus, but also included Muslims and Christians. They were subject to [[Indentured servant|indenture]], a long-established form of contract which bound them to forced labour for a fixed term; apart from the fixed term of servitude, this resembled slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New System of Slavery|first= Hugh | last=Tinker| year=1993| isbn=978-1-870518-18-5| publisher= Hansib Publishing, London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ships carrying indentured labourers from India left in 1836.&lt;ref name=britain1&gt;{{cite web|title=Forced Labour| year=2010| publisher=The National Archives, Government of the United Kingdom| url= http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/india/forced.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sugarcane]], a crop that is native to India, does not grow in the cold latitudes such as those found in Europe, but grows in tropical latitudes, were grown in large colonial tropical plantations to meet the growing European and American demand. It is these sugarcane and other tropical cash crop plantations that brought the indentured Hindus and other migrants from India to Mauritius, and other island countries such as [[Fiji]], [[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad]], [[Martinique]], [[Suriname]] and others.&lt;ref name=britain1/&gt;

The Hindus, and non-Hindus, who accepted indentured labor contracts and were brought to Mauritius, faced difficult conditions in India. [[Poverty in India#Before Independence|Poverty in colonial India]], starvation, epidemics and severe periodic famines in [[British Raj]] were rampant during the colonial rule.&lt;ref name="Northrup1995p62"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Northrup|title=Indentured Labor in the Age of Imperialism, 1834-1922|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kS84AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA62|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-48047-5|pages=62–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emmer1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pieter C.

In the 1840s a severe shortage of cheap labor in British plantation colonies led to systematic shipment of large number of indentured laborers to Mauritius, both men and women, particularly from the ports of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras.&lt;ref name="Northrup1995p62"/&gt;&lt;ref name=britain1/&gt; According to [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]] – a professor of Sociology, the Hindus and non-Hindus of India who arrived in Mauritius were a small percentage of the over 30 million indentured Indian workers shipped around the colonial world between the 18th and early 20th century (many of whom returned after serving for years as plantation labor).&lt;ref name="Marriott2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|editor=John Marriott |title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Modern Imperial Histories| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zs3OCwAAQBAJ | year=2016| publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-04251-8|chapter=Chapter 16: Circulation and Migration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Mauritius gained independence from the British Empire, a majority of its population were from Indian heritage. According to Patrick Eisenlohr, about 70% of Mauritius' total population is of Indian origin. Those who identify themselves as Hindus constitute about 48% of the total population, or about 69% of those of Indian origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Eisenlohr|title=Little India: Diaspora, Time, and Ethnolinguistic Belonging in Hindu Mauritius|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFzcGV9FlxgC|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24879-3|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The major languages spoken by Hindus in Mauritius, at home and in commerce, are Creole, Bhojpuri, Tamil and Hindi.&lt;ref name=eisenlohr51&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Eisenlohr|title=Little India: Diaspora, Time, and Ethnolinguistic Belonging in Hindu Mauritius|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFzcGV9FlxgC|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24879-3|pages=51–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The politically active Hindus, states Eisenholr, have attempted to preserve Hindi by calling it their "mother tongue" and "ancestral language", as well as an assurance against the colonial discrimination they faced, but most Hindus mainly use Creole in their daily lives – a syncretic language of Indians and Africans that has developed on the island.&lt;ref name=eisenlohr51/&gt;

The island nation carries many Bhojpuri-language television programs on Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation, the channel controlled by the Mauritius government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Eisenlohr|title=Little India: Diaspora, Time, and Ethnolinguistic Belonging in Hindu Mauritius|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFzcGV9FlxgC|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24879-3|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindus in Mauritius that widely use Bhojpuri include the rural south and north-central region near [[:fr:La Nicolière|La Nicolière]].&lt;ref name=eisenlohr67&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Eisenlohr|title=Little India: Diaspora, Time, and Ethnolinguistic Belonging in Hindu Mauritius|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFzcGV9FlxgC|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24879-3|pages=67–69, 207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; These settlements are of Hindus primarily from Gangetic plains regions of Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh, and their language is a modified form – a [[Koiné language|koiné]] in linguistic studies – of the original Bhojpuri.&lt;ref name=eisenlohr67/&gt;

==Demographics==

As per the 2011 Census, Hindus constituted for 48.54% of the total population of Mauritius. Excluding the island of Rodrigues, Hindus were 50.15% of the population (36.79% in Urban areas, and 59.72% in the rural areas). In the island of Rodrigues, Hindus are 0.84% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20131016141533/http://www.gov.mu/portal/goc/cso/file/2011VolIIPC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social stratification==
According to Oddvar Hollup and other scholars, Hindus that settled in Mauritius did not observe caste system and intercaste restrictions have been unimportant in Mauritius.&lt;ref name="Hollup 1994 297"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hollup | first=Oddvar | title=The Disintegration of Caste and Changing Concepts of Indian Ethnic Identity in Mauritius | journal=Ethnology | volume=33 | issue=4 | year=1994 | pages=297–316 | doi=10.2307/3773901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Grieco | first=Elizabeth M. | title=The Effects of Migration on the Establishment of Networks: Caste Disintegration and Reformation among the Indians of Fiji | journal=International Migration Review | volume=32 | issue=3 | year=1998 | page=704 | doi=10.2307/2547769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jayawardena | first=Chandra | title=Migration and Social Change: A Survey of Indian Communities Overseas | journal=Geographical Review | volume=58 | issue=3 | year=1968 | page=426 | doi=10.2307/212565 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars, states Hollup, observe that this may be because "the economic and political conditions in the host societies where indentured Indian laborers were introduced had conditions that were not conducive to the maintenance of caste", and that caste was not a principle of social organization as all Indian laborers (coolies) were "doing the same kind of work and sharing the same living conditions".&lt;ref name="Hollup 1994 297"/&gt;

==Major Hindu festivals==
[[File:Mauritius Divali Diwali Lighting and Decorations 2010.jpg|thumb|The Hindus in Mauritius observe major festivals, such as [[Diwali]] in [[Port Louis]] above.]]
One of the biggest Hindu festivals on the island is [[Maha Shivaratri]] ("Great Night of Shiva"). During this annual Hindu celebration, which takes place in the months of February and March, four to nine days of ceremony and fasting lead up to an all-night vigil of Shiva worship.

Other important Hindu festivals in Mauritius include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Dodd|title=Mauritius, Réunion &amp; Seychelles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G_H5-2H_OcUC&amp;pg=PA134|year=2004|isbn=978-1-74059-301-4|pages=93, 134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Thaipusam]], honoring the South Indian god [[Muruga]].

{{Buddhism}}
The '''history of Buddhism''' spans from the 5th century BCE to the present. [[Buddhism]] arose in the eastern part of [[Ancient India]], in and around the ancient Kingdom of [[Magadha]] (now in [[Bihar]], [[India]]), and is based on the teachings of [[Siddhartha Gautama|Siddhārtha Gautama]]. This makes it one of the oldest religions practiced today. The religion evolved as it spread from the northeastern region of the Indian subcontinent through [[Central Asia|Central]], [[East Asia|East]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. At one time or another, it influenced most of the Asian continent. The history of Buddhism is also characterized by the development of numerous movements, schisms, and schools, among them the [[Theravada|Theravāda]], [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] and [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] traditions, with contrasting periods of expansion and retreat.

==Life of the Buddha==
[[File:Mahajanapadas (c. 500 BCE).png|thumb|250px|The [[Mahajanapadas]] were sixteen most powerful and vast kingdoms and republics around the lifetime of [[Gautama Buddha]]（563BC-483BC）, located mainly across the fertile [[Indo-Gangetic plains]], there were also a number of smaller kingdoms stretching the length and breadth of [[Ancient India]].]]
[[Siddhārtha Gautama]] was the historical founder of [[Buddhism]]. The early sources state he was born in the small [[Shakya]] (Pali: Sakka) Republic, which was part of the [[Kosala]] realm of [[Janapada|ancient India]], now in modern-day [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; He is thus also known as the ''Shakyamuni'' (literally: "The sage of the Shakya clan"). The republic was ruled by a council of household heads, and Gautama was born to one of these elites, so that he described himself as a [[Kshatriya]] when talking to Brahmins.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Early Buddhist Texts]] contain no continuous life of the Buddha, only later after 200 BCE were various "biographies" with much mythological embellishment written.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; All texts agree however that Gautama renounced the householder life and lived as a [[Śramaṇa|sramana]] [[Asceticism|ascetic]] for some time studying under various teachers, before attaining [[nirvana]] (extinguishment) and [[bodhi]] (awakening) through meditation. 

For the remaining 45 years of his life, he traveled the [[Gangetic Plain]] of central [[India]] (the region of the [[Ganges River|Ganges/Ganga river]] and its tributaries), teaching his doctrine to a diverse range of people from different [[Caste system in India|castes]] and initiating monks into his order. The Buddha sent his disciples to spread the teaching across India. He also initiated an order of nuns.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; He urged his disciples to teach in the local language or dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent a lot of his time near the cities of [[Shravasti|Sāvatthī]], [[Rajgir|Rājagaha]] and [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vesālī]] (Skt. Śrāvastī, Rājagrha, Vāiśalī).&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his death at 80, he had thousands of followers.

The years following the death of the Buddha saw the emergence of many movements during the next 400 years: first the schools of [[Nikaya Buddhism]], of which only [[Theravada]] remains today, and then the formation of [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]], pan-Buddhist sects based on the acceptance of new scriptures and the revision of older techniques.

Followers of Buddhism, called '''Buddhists''' in English, referred to themselves as ''Sakyan''-s or ''Sakyabhiksu'' in ancient India.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond Enlightenment: Buddhism, Religion, Modernity'' by Richard Cohen. Routledge 1999. {{ISBN|0415544440}}. pg 33. "Donors adopted Sakyamuni Buddha’s family name to assert their legitimacy as his heirs, both institutionally and ideologically. To take the name of Sakya was to define oneself by one’s affiliation with the buddha, somewhat like calling oneself a Buddhist today.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sakya or Buddhist Origins'' by Caroline Rhys Davids (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1931) pg 1. "Put away the word “Buddhism” and think of your subject as “Sakya.” This will at once place you for your perspective at a true point.   You are now concerned to learn less about 'Buddha' and 'Buddhism,' and more about him whom India has ever known as Sakya-muni, and about his men who, as their records admit, were spoken of as the Sakya-sons, or men of the Sakyas."&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist scholar Donald S. Lopez asserts they also used the term ''Bauddha'',&lt;ref&gt;''Curators of the Buddha'' By Donald S. Lopez. University of Chicago Press. pg 7&lt;/ref&gt; although scholar Richard Cohen asserts that that term was used only by outsiders to describe Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond Enlightenment: Buddhism, Religion, Modernity'' by Richard Cohen. Routledge 1999. {{ISBN|0415544440}}. pg 33. Bauddha is "a secondary derivative of buddha, in which the vowel’s lengthening indicates connection or relation. Things that are bauddha pertain to the buddha, just as things Saiva relato to Siva and things Vaisnava belong to Visnu. . . baudda can be both adjectival and nominal; it can be used for doctrines spoken by the buddha, obejects enjoyed by him, texts attributed to him, as well as individuals, communities, and societies that offer him reverence or accept ideologies certified through his name. Strictly speaking, Sakya is preferable to bauddha since the latter is not attested at Ajanta. In fact, as a collective noun, bauddha is an outsider’s term. The bauddha did not call themselves this in India, though they did sometimes use the word adjectivally (e.g., as a possessive, the buddha’s)."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Buddhism ==
{{Further information|Early Buddhism}}
After the death of the Buddha, the Buddhist [[sangha]] (monastic community) remained centered on the Ganges valley, spreading gradually from its ancient heartland. The canonical sources record various councils, where the monastic [[Sangha]] recited and organized the orally transmitted collections of the Buddha's teachings and settled certain disciplinary problems within the community. Modern scholarship has questioned the accuracy and historicity of these traditional accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Berkwitz, Stephen C. South Asian Buddhism: A Survey, Routledge, 2012, page 43.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first Buddhist council is traditionally said to have been held just after Buddha's [[Parinirvana]], and presided over by [[Mahākāśyapa]], one of His most senior disciples, at Rājagṛha (today's [[Rajgir]]) with the support of king Ajāthaśatru. According to Charles Prebish, almost all scholars have questioned the historicity of this first council.&lt;ref&gt;Prebish, Charles S. Buddhism: A Modern Perspective, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Buddhist council is said to have caused the first schism of the sangha into the [[Sthavira nikāya|Sthavira]] (Elders) and [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahasamghika]] (Great Sangha). Most scholars agree that the schism was caused by disagreements over points of [[vinaya]] (monastic discipline).&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (2013). ''An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices (2nd ed.).'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. pg. 88-90.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, these two monastic fraternities would further divide into various [[Early Buddhist schools|Early Buddhist Schools]]. The Sthaviras gave birth to a large number of influential schools including the [[Sarvāstivāda]], the [[Pudgalavāda]] (also known as ''Vatsīputrīya''), the [[Dharmaguptaka]]s and the [[Vibhajyavāda]] ([[Theravada|Theravādins]] being descended from these). The [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahasamghikas]] meanwhile also developed their own schools and doctrines early on, which can seen in texts like the [[Mahavastu]], associated with the [[Lokottaravāda]], or ‘Transcendentalist’ school, who might be the same as the [[Ekavyāvahārika]]s or "One-utterancers".&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; This school has been seen as foreshadowing certain [[Mahayana]] ideas, especially due to their view that all of Gautama Buddha's acts were "transcendental" or "supramundane", even those performed before his Buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third century BCE, some Buddhists began introducing new systematized teachings called [[Abhidharma]], based on previous lists or tables (''Matrka'') of main doctrinal topics.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Nikāya|Nikayas]], which were prose [[Sutta Pitaka|sutras]] or discourses, the Abhidharma literature consisted of systematic doctrinal exposition and often differed across the Buddhist schools who disagreed on points of doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Abhidharma sought to analyze all experience into its ultimate constituents, phenomenal events or processes called ''dharmas''.

During the reign of the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] Emperor [[Ashoka|Aśoka]] (273&amp;ndash;232 BCE), Buddhism gained royal support and began to spread more widely reaching most of the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; After his invasion of Kalinga, [[Ashoka|Aśoka]] seems to have experienced remorse and began working to improve the lives of his subjects. [[Ashoka|Aśoka]] also built wells, rest-houses and hospitals for humans and animals, he also abolished torture, royal hunting trips and perhaps even the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ashoka|Aśoka]] also supported non-Buddhist faiths like Jainism and Brahmanism.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ashoka|Aśoka]] propagated religion by building [[stupa]]s and pillars urging, among other things, respect of all animal life and enjoining people to follow the [[Dharma]]. He has been hailed by Buddhist sources as the model for the compassionate [[Chakravarti (Sanskrit term)|chakravartin]] (wheel turning monarch). &lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another feature of Mauryan Buddhism was the worship and veneration of [[Stupa|stupas]], large mounds which contained relics ([[Pali]]: sarīra) of the Buddha or other saints within.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that the practice of devotion to these relics and stupas could bring blessings.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best preserved example of a Mauryan Buddhist site is the [[Great Stupa of Sanchi]] (dating from the 3rd century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;   

According to the plates and pillars left by Aśoka (the [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts of Aśoka]]), emissaries were sent to various countries in order to spread Buddhism, as far south as [[Sri Lanka]] and as far west as the Greek kingdoms, in particular the neighboring [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], and possibly even farther to the Mediterranean.

[[Theravada|Theravadin]] sources state that [[Ashoka|Aśoka]] convened the third Buddhist council around 250 BC at Pataliputra (today's [[Patna, India|Patna]]) with the elder [[Moggaliputtatissa]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the council was to purify the Saṅgha, particularly from non-Buddhist ascetics who had been attracted by the royal patronage. Following the council, Buddhist missionaries were dispatched throughout the known world.

=== Proselytism in the Hellenistic world ===
Some of the [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts of Aśoka]] describe the efforts made by him to propagate the Buddhist faith throughout the Hellenistic world, which at that time formed an uninterrupted continuum from the borders of India to Greece. The edicts indicate a clear understanding of the political organization in Hellenistic territories: the names and locations of the main Greek monarchs of the time are identified, and they are claimed as recipients of Buddhist [[proselytism]]: [[Antiochus II Theos]] of the [[Seleucid Kingdom]] (261&amp;ndash;246 BCE), [[Ptolemy II of Egypt|Ptolemy II Philadelphos]] of Egypt (285&amp;ndash;247 BCE), [[Antigonus Gonatas]] of Macedonia (276&amp;ndash;239 BCE), [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] (288&amp;ndash;258 BCE) in [[Cyrenaica]] (modern [[Libya]]), and [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander II]] (272&amp;ndash;255 BCE) in [[Epirus]] (modern Northwestern [[Greece]]). One of the edicts states:

:"The conquest by [[Dharma]] has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred [[yojana]]s (5,400–9,600 km) away, where the Greek king Antiochos rules, beyond there where the four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonos, Magas and Alexander rule, likewise in the south among the [[Chola]]s, the [[Pandya]]s, and as far as [[Tamraparni]] ([[Sri Lanka]])." ([[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts of Aśoka]], 13th Rock Edict, S. Dhammika).

Furthermore, according to the [[Mahavamsa]] (XII) some of Aśoka's emissaries were Greek ([[Yona]]), particularly one named [[Dharmaraksita|Dhammarakkhita]]. Aśoka also issued edicts in the Greek language as well as in Aramaic. One of them, found in Kandahar, advocates the adoption of "piety" (using the Greek term ''[[eusebeia]]'' for [[Dharma]]) to the Greek community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120201030234/http://www.afghanan.net/afghanistan/mauryans.htm ''History of Afghanistan'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear how much these interactions may have been influential, but authors like [[Robert Linssen]] have commented that Buddhism may have influenced Western thought and religion at that time. Linssen points to the presence of Buddhist communities in the Hellenistic world around that period, in particular in [[Alexandria]] (mentioned by [[Clement of Alexandria]]), and to the pre-Christian monastic order of the [[Therapeutae]] (possibly a deformation of the Pāli word "[[Theravada|Theravāda]]"&lt;ref&gt;According to the linguist Zacharias P. Thundy&lt;/ref&gt;), who may have "almost entirely drawn (its) inspiration from the teaching and practices of Buddhist asceticism"&lt;ref&gt;"Zen living", [[Robert Linssen]]&lt;/ref&gt; and may even have been descendants of Aśoka's emissaries to the West.&lt;ref&gt;"The Original Jesus" (Element Books, Shaftesbury, 1995), Elmar R Gruber, Holger Kersten&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers like [[Hegesias of Cyrene]] and [[Pyrrho]] are sometimes thought to have been influenced by Buddhist teachings.&lt;ref&gt;"The philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene (nicknamed ''Peisithanatos'', "The advocate of death") was a contemporary of Magas and was probably influenced by the teachings of the Buddhist missionaries to Cyrene and Alexandria. His influence was such that he was ultimately prohibited from teaching." Jean-Marie Lafont, [[Inalco]] in "Les Dossiers d'Archéologie", No254, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Kuzminski, Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism (Studies in Comparative Philosophy and Religion) 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist gravestones from the [[Ptolemaic period]] have also been found in Alexandria, decorated with depictions of the Dharma wheel.&lt;ref&gt;Tarn, ''The Greeks in Bactria and India''&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of Buddhists in Alexandria has even drawn the conclusion that they influenced monastic Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Linssen]], ''Zen living''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2nd century CE, the Christian dogmatist, [[Clement of Alexandria]] recognized Bactrian ''[[Sramana|śramanas]]'' and Indian ''[[gymnosophist]]s'' for their influence on Greek thought.&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria "The Stromata, or Miscellanies" Book I, Chapter XV: {{cite web |url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/clement-stromata-book1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510193118/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/clement-stromata-book1.html |archivedate=2010-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sri Lanka]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n chronicles like the ''[[Dipavamsa]]'' state that Aśoka's son [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]] brought Buddhism to the island during the 2nd century BCE. In addition, Aśoka's daughter, [[Sanghamitta|Saṅghamitta]] also established the bhikkhunī (order for nuns) in Sri Lanka, also bringing with her a sapling of the sacred bodhi tree that was subsequently planted in [[Anuradhapura]]. These two figures are seen as the mythical founders of the Sri Lankan [[Theravada]].&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, Kate (2013), Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity, Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 1–3, {{ISBN|9781405189071}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are said to have converted the King [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|Devanampiya Tissa]] (307 - 267 BCE) and many of the nobility.



The first architectural records of Buddha images however, actually come from the reign of king [[Vasabha of Anuradhapura|Vasabha]] (65-109 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Bandaranayake, S.D. Sinhalese Monastic Architecture: The Viháras of Anurádhapura, page 22&lt;/ref&gt; The major Buddhist monasteries and schools in Ancient Sri Lanka were [[Mahavihara|Mahāvihāra]], [[Abhayagiri vihāra|Abhayagiri]] and [[Jetavana]].&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pali Canon|Pāli canon]] was written down during the 1st century BCE to preserve the teaching in a time of war and famine.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, Theravada Buddhism, a social history from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo, Routledge; 2 edition (July 26, 2006), page 152&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only complete collection of [[Buddhist texts]] to survive in a [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|Middle Indo-Aryan language]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, In the Buddha's words, p 13&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects the tradition of the  [[Mahavihara]] school.

Although [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna Buddhism]] gained some influence in Sri Lanka as it was studied in [[Abhayagiri vihāra|Abhayagiri]] and [[Jetavana]], the [[Mahavihara]] (“Great Monastery”) school became dominant in Sri Lanka following the reign of [[Parakramabahu I]] (1153–1186), who abolished the Abhayagiri and Jetavanin traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa, Akira; Groner, Paul (1993).

==Mahāyāna Buddhism==
[[File:Amaravati Stupa relief at Museum.jpg|thumb|A relief depicting the [[Amaravathi Mahachaitya]] or Amarāvatī Stupa, a major site in [[Andhra Pradesh]]]]
{{Further information|Mahayana}}
The Buddhist movement that became known as Mahayana (Great Vehicle) and also the Bodhisattvayana, began sometime between 150 BCE and 100 CE, drawing on both [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahasamghika]] and [[Sarvastivada]] trends.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 108, 110&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest inscription which is recognizably Mahayana dates from 180 CE and is found in [[Mathura]].&lt;ref&gt;Neelis, Jason. ''Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks.''2010. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mahayana emphasized the [[Bodhisattva]] path and the doctrine of [[upaya]] (skill in means). It emerged as a set of loose groups associated with new texts named the [[Mahayana sutras]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahayana sutras promoted new doctrines, such as the idea that "there exist other Buddhas who are simultaneously preaching in countless other world-systems".&lt;ref&gt;Snellgrove, David L. Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and Their Tibetan Successors, 2004, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; In time Mahayana Bodhisattvas and also multiple Buddhas came to be seen as transcendental beneficent beings who were subjects of devotion.&lt;ref&gt;Snellgrove, David L. Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and Their Tibetan Successors, 2004, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mahayana remained a minority among Indian Buddhists for some time, growing slowly until about half of all monks encountered by [[Xuanzang]] in 7th-century India were Mahayanists.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Mahayana schools of thought included the [[Madhyamaka|Mādhyamaka]], [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]], and [[Buddha-nature]] (''Tathāgatagarbha'') teachings. Mahayana is today the dominant form of Buddhism in East Asia and Tibet.

Several scholars have suggested that the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā sūtras]], which are among the earliest Mahāyāna sūtras,&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge, 2000, pages 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations 2nd edition.'' Routledge, 2009, pg. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; developed among the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] along the [[Krishna River|Kṛṣṇa River]] in the [[Andhra Pradesh#Early history|Āndhra]] region of [[South India]].&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. pp. 65–66 "Several scholars have suggested that the Prajñāpāramitā probably developed among the Mahasamghikas in Southern India, in the Andhra country, on the Krsna River."&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Mahāyāna sūtras to include the very first versions of the [[Prajñāpāramitā]] genre, along with texts concerning [[Aksobhya|Akṣobhya Buddha]], which were probably written down in the 1st century BCE in the south of India.&lt;ref name="Hirakawa Akira 1993, p. 263"&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993).

==Shunga dynasty (2nd&amp;ndash;1st century BCE)==
{{Further information|Shunga Empire}}
[[File:Sanchi Great Stupa under the Sungas.jpg|thumb|250px|During 2nd century BCE the [[Sanchi]] stupa was nearly doubled in diameter, was encased in stone, and a [[balustrade]] and railing was built around it.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, C. Third Century BC to Fifth Century AD, Julia Shaw, Left Coast Press, 2013 [https://books.google.com/books?id=jzkyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88 p.88ff]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Shunga dynasty]] (185&amp;ndash;73 BCE) was established about 50 years after Aśoka's death. After assassinating King [[Brhadrata]] (last of the [[Mauryan]] rulers), military commander-in-chief [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] took the throne. Buddhist religious scriptures such as the [[Ashokavadana|Aśokāvadāna]] allege that Pushyamitra (an orthodox [[Brahmin]]) was hostile towards Buddhists and persecuted the Buddhist faith. Buddhists wrote that he "destroyed hundreds of monasteries and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent Monks":&lt;ref&gt;[[Divyavadana|Divyāvadāna]], pp. 429&amp;ndash;434&lt;/ref&gt; 840,000 Buddhist [[stupa]]s which had been built by Aśoka were destroyed, and 100 gold coins were offered for the head of each Buddhist monk.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Historical Quarterly Vol. XXII, p. 81 ff cited in Hars.407&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2018}}

Modern historians, however, dispute this view in the light of literary and archaeological evidence. They opine that following Aśoka's sponsorship of Buddhism, it is possible that Buddhist institutions fell on harder times under the Shungas, but no evidence of active persecution has been noted. [[Etienne Lamotte]] observes: "To judge from the documents, Pushyamitra must be acquitted through lack of proof."&lt;ref&gt;[http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/books/acat/ch2.htm Elst, Koneraad ''Ashoka and Pushyamitra, iconoclasts?'']&lt;/ref&gt; Another eminent historian, [[Romila Thapar]] points to archaeological evidence that "suggests the contrary" to the claim that "Pushyamitra was a fanatical anti-Buddhist" and that he "never actually destroyed 840,000 stupas as claimed by Buddhist works, if any". Thapar stresses that Buddhist accounts are probably hyperbolic renditions of Pushyamitra's attack of the Mauryas, and merely reflect the desperate frustration of the Buddhist religious figures in the face of the possibly irreversible decline in the importance of their religion under the Shungas.&lt;ref&gt;Aśoka and the Decline of the Mauryas by Romila Thapar, Oxford University Press, 1960 P200&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period, Buddhist monks deserted the [[Ganges]] valley, following either the northern road (''[[uttarapatha]]'') or the southern road (''dakṣinapatha'').&lt;ref&gt;"Gandhara", Francine Tissot, p128: "The monks, expelled from the Ganges valley, maybe by sectarian disputes, followed the northern road (Uttarapatha) or the northern road (Daksinapatha), which conducted them to the Northwest for some, and to the Occidental ocean for the others, with multiple artistic creations marking their respective roads"&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Buddhist artistic creation stopped in the old [[Magadha]] area, to reposition itself either in the northwest area of [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]] and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] or in the southeast around [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]]. Some artistic activity also occurred in central India, as in [[Bharhut|Bhārhut]], to which the Shungas may or may not have contributed.

==Greco-Buddhism==
{{Main article|Greco-Buddhism}}
{{See also|Greco-Buddhist art|Buddhism and the Roman world}}
[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|200px|right|A [[Greco-Buddhist]] statue, one of the first representations of the Buddha, 1st-2nd century AD, [[Gandhara]].]]

The [[Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius I]] (reigned c. 200–180 BCE) invaded the Indian Subcontinent, establishing an [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greek kingdom]] that was to last in parts of Northwest South Asia until the end of the 1st century CE.
Buddhism flourished under the Indo-Greek and Greco-Bactrian kings. One of the most famous Indo-Greek kings is [[Menander I|Menander]] (reigned c. 160&amp;ndash;135 BCE). He may have converted to Buddhism&lt;ref&gt;Narain, "The Indo-Greeks" 2003, p.124&lt;/ref&gt; and is presented in the Mahāyāna tradition as one of the great benefactors of the faith, on a par with king Aśoka or the later Kushan king [[Kanishka|Kaniśka]]. Menander's coins bear designs of the eight-spoked [[Dharmachakra|dharma wheel]], a classic Buddhist symbol. Direct cultural exchange is also suggested by the dialogue of the [[Milinda Panha|Milinda Pañha]] between [[Menander I|Menander]] and the Buddhist monk [[Nagasena|Nāgasena]], who was himself a student of the Greek Buddhist monk [[Mahadharmaraksita]]. Upon Menander's death, the honor of sharing his remains was claimed by the cities under his rule, and they were enshrined in [[stupa]]s, in a parallel with the historic Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], Praec. reip. ger. 28, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Menander's [[Indo-Greek]] successors inscribed "Follower of the Dharma," in the [[Kharoshthi|Kharoṣṭhī]] script, on their coins.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Impact on Indian Life and Culture (c. 326 B.C. to C. 300 A.D.)

During the first century BCE the first [[anthropomorphic]] representations of the Buddha are found in the lands ruled by the Indo-Greeks, in a realistic style known as [[Greco-Buddhist]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, "The Buddhist art of Gandhara", p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the stylistic elements in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: the [[Greco-Roman]] [[toga]]-like wavy robe covering both shoulders (more exactly, its lighter version, the Greek ''[[himation]]''), the [[contrapposto]] stance of the upright figures (see: 1st&amp;ndash;2nd century Gandhara standing Buddhas&lt;ref&gt;Standing Buddhas: [http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/gaddis/HST210/Oct21/Gandhara%20Buddha.jpg Image 1]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616041314/http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/gaddis/HST210/Oct21/Gandhara%20Buddha.jpg |date=2013-06-16 }}, [http://www.kimbellart.org/database/images/jpg/AP1967_01.jpg Image 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021055258/http://www.kimbellart.org/database/images/jpg/AP1967_01.jpg |date=2006-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), the stylicized [[Mediterranean]] curly hair and topknot ([[ushnisha]]) apparently derived from the style of the [[Apollo Belvedere|Belvedere Apollo]] (330 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;The Belvedere Apollo: [http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/h/images/hellenis_apolbelve.det.lg.JPG Image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603203546/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/h/images/hellenis_apolbelve.det.lg.JPG |date=2014-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] (See: [[Greek art]]). A large quantity of [[sculpture]]s combining Buddhist and purely Hellenistic styles and [[iconography]] were excavated at the [[Gandhara]]n site of [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]].

Several influential Greek Buddhist monks are recorded. [[Mahadharmaraksita]] (literally translated as 'Great Teacher/Preserver of the Dharma'), was "a Greek ("[[Yona]]") Buddhist head monk", according to the [[Mahavamsa]] (Chap. XXIX&lt;ref&gt;Full text of the Mahavamsa [http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chapters.html Click chapter XXIX] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905050433/http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chapters.html |date=2006-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), who led 30,000 Buddhist monks from "the Greek city of Alasandra" ([[Alexandria of the Caucasus]], around 150&amp;nbsp;km north of today's [[Kabul]] in [[Afghanistan]]), to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the [[Ruwanwelisaya|Great Stupa]] in [[Anuradhapura]] during the rule (165 BC - 135 BC) of King [[Menander I]]. [[Dharmaraksita|Dhammarakkhita]] (meaning: ''Protected by the [[Dharma]]''), was one of the [[missionary|missionaries]] sent by the [[Mauryan]] emperor [[Ashoka]] to proselytize the [[Buddhist]] faith. He is described as being a Greek ([[Pāli|Pali]]: "[[Yona]]", lit. "[[Ionia]]n") in the [[Mahavamsa]].

Emperor [[Kanishka]] (128–151 CE) is particularly known for his support of Buddhism. During his reign, stupas and monasteries were built in the Gandhāran city of [[Peshawar]] (Skt. ''Purusapura''), which he used as a capital.&lt;ref&gt;Heirman, Ann; Bumbacher, Stephan Peter (editors). The Spread of Buddhism, Brill, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Kushan royal support and the opening of trade routes allowed Gandharan Buddhism to spread along the [[Silk Road]] to [[Central Asia]], the [[Tarim Basin]] and thus to China.&lt;ref&gt;Heirman, Ann; Bumbacher, Stephan Peter (editors). The Spread of Buddhism, Brill, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanishka is also said to have convened a major Buddhist council for the [[Sarvastivada]] tradition, either in [[Gandhara]] or [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;Prebish, Charles S. Buddhism: A Modern Perspective, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Kanishka gathered 500 learned monks partly to compile extensive commentaries on the [[Abhidharma]], although it is possible that some editorial work was carried out upon the existing [[Sarvastivada]] canon itself. Allegedly during the council there were altogether three hundred thousand verses and over nine million statements compiled, and it took twelve years to complete. The main fruit of this council was the compilation of the vast commentary known as the [[Mahavibhasa|Mahā-Vibhāshā]] ("Great Exegesis"), an extensive compendium and reference work on a portion of the Sarvāstivādin Abhidharma.&lt;ref&gt;Prebish, Charles S. Buddhism: A Modern Perspective, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars such as [[Etienne Lamotte]] and [[David Snellgrove]] have questioned the veracity of this traditional account.&lt;ref&gt;Indo-Tibetan Buddhism. Snellgrove, David. Shambhala. Boston:2003. pg. 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Teaching of Vimalakirti'', Pali Text Society, page XCIII&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars believe that it was also around this time that a significant change was made in the language of the Sarvāstivādin canon, by converting an earlier [[Prakrit]] version into [[Sanskrit]]. Although this change was probably effected without significant loss of integrity to the canon, this event was of particular significance since Sanskrit was the sacred language of [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] in India, and was also being used by other thinkers, regardless of their specific religious or philosophical allegiance, thus enabling a far wider audience to gain access to Buddhist ideas and practices.

After the fall of the Kushans, small kingdoms ruled the Gandharan region, and later the [[Hephthalite|Hephthalite White Huns]] conquered the area (circa 440s–670). Under the Hephthalites, Gandharan Buddhism continued to thrive in cities like [[Balkh]] ([[Bactria]]), as remarked by [[Xuanzang]] who visited the region in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhism in Central Asia ''by [[Baij Nath Puri]], Motilal Banarsi Dass Publishers, Page 130''&lt;/ref&gt; Xuanzang notes that there were over a hundred Buddhist monasteries in the city, including the [[Nava Vihara]] as well many stupas and monks.&lt;ref&gt;van Bladel, Kevin (2011).

Behrendt, The Buddhist architecture of Gandhara, Handbuch der Orientalistik BRILL, 2004, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; However it continued to thrive in adjacent areas like the [[Swat District|Swat Valley]] of Pakistan, [[Gilgit]], Kashmir and in Afghanistan (in sites such as [[Bamyan|Bamiyan]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gand/hd_gand.htm Behrent, Kurt.

==Spread to Central Asia==

[[File:ExtentOfBuddhismAndTrade.jpg|thumb|250px|Extent of Buddhism and trade routes in the 1st century AD.]]
[[File:Central Asian Buddhist Monks.jpeg|thumb|200px|Blue-eyed [[Central Asia]]n and East-Asian Buddhist monks, [[Bezeklik]], Eastern [[Tarim Basin]], China, 9th and 10th centuries.]]

[[Central Asia]] was home to the international trade route known as the Silk Road, which carried goods between [[China]], [[India]], the [[Middle East|Middle east]] and the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean world]]. Buddhism was present in this region from about the second century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the [[Dharmaguptaka]] school was the most successful in their efforts to spread Buddhism in Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kingdom of Khotan]] was one of the earliest Buddhist kindgoms in the area and helped transmit Buddhism from India to China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9040640 "Khotan - Britannica Online Encyclopedia"]. Britannica.com. &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kushan Empire|Kushan empire]]'s unification of most of this area and their support of Buddhism allowed it to easily spread along the trade routes of the region throughout Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Heirman, Ann; Bumbacher, Stephan Peter (editors). The Spread of Buddhism, Brill, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; During the first century CE under the Kushans, the Sarvastivada school flourished in this region, some of the monks also bringing Mahayana teachings with them.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism would eventually reach modern-day [[Pakistan]], [[Kashmir]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Tajikistan]]. As Buddhism reached many of these lands, Buddhists began to translate and produce texts in the local languages, such as [[Khotanese language|Khotanese]] (a [[Iranian languages|Middle Iranian language]]), [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] (also Iranian), [[Uyghur language|Uigur]] ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]), [[Tangut language|Tangut]], [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]], and Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Silk, Jonathan, The spread of Buddhism in Central Asia. International Institute for Asian Studies, Newsletter No 68, 2014  {{cite web |url=https://iias.asia/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL68_41.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-04-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121155530/https://iias.asia/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL68_41.pdf |archivedate=2018-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central Asians played a key role in the transmission of Buddhism to China The first translators of Buddhists scriptures into Chinese were Iranians, including the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] [[An Shigao]] (c. 148 CE), the [[Yuezhi]] [[Zhi Qian]] and Kang Sengkai (from Samarkand).&lt;ref name="Kudara2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kudara|first1=Kogi|title=A Rough Sketch of Central Asian Buddhism|journal=Pacific World: Journal of the Institute of Buddhist Studies|date=2002|volume=3|issue=4|pages=93–107|url=http://www.shin-ibs.edu/publications/pacific-world/third-series-number-4-fall-2002/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406102117/http://www.shin-ibs.edu/publications/pacific-world/third-series-number-4-fall-2002/|archivedate=2018-04-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-seven early translators of Buddhist texts are known, and the majority of them have been identified as hailing from the Iranian cultural sphere.&lt;ref name="Kudara2002" /&gt; The [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian empire]] (226–651 CE) would eventually rule over many of these regions (such as [[Parthia]] and [[Sogdia]]), but they tolerated the Buddhist religion.&lt;ref name="Kudara2002" /&gt; During the mid-seventh century, the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Islamic conquest]] of the [[Iranian Plateau]] followed by the [[Muslim conquests of Afghanistan]] and the later establishment of the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid kingdom]] in Central Asia (ca. 977–1186) led to the decline and eventual disappearance of Buddhism from most of these regions.&lt;ref name="Kudara2002" /&gt;

Buddhism also flourished in the eastern part of central Asia ([[Xinjiang|Chinese Turkestan]], [[Tarim Basin]]). Indians and Iranians lived in major cities of this region like [[Kashgar]] and [[Khotan]].&lt;ref name="Kudara2002" /&gt; The region has revealed extremely rich Buddhist works of art as well as Buddhist texts such as [[Dunhuang manuscripts|those found in Dunhuang]]. [[Serindian art]] is highly reminiscent of the Gandhāran style, and scriptures in the Gandhāri script [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭhī]] have been found. The [[Uyghurs]] conquered the area in the 8th century and blended with the local Iranian peoples, absorbing the Buddhist culture of the region.&lt;ref name="Kudara2002" /&gt; They were later absorbed by the mongol [[Yuan dynasty]]. Many printed Buddhist texts from the region date to the Yuan, and they were printed in the Uyghur, Xixia and Sanskrit languages.&lt;ref name="Kudara2002" /&gt; The Uyghurs also restored cave temples and repainted Buddhist wall paintings such as at [[Bezeklik Caves|Bezeklik]].&lt;ref name="Kudara2002" /&gt; Uyghur Buddhism was the last major Buddhist culture in East Turkestan and it lasted until the mid 14th century.&lt;ref name="Kudara2002" /&gt; After the [[Islamicisation of Xinjiang]], Buddhism ceased to be a major religion there.

{{Further information|History of Buddhism in India|Decline of Buddhism in India}}
Buddhism continued to flourish in India during the [[Gupta Empire]] (4th-6th centuries) which brought order to much of north India. Gupta rulers such as [[Kumaragupta I]] (c. 414 – 455 CE) supported and enlarged the [[Nālandā]] university, which became the largest and most influential Buddhist university in India for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;The Gupta Empire by Radhakumud Mookerji [https://books.google.com/books?id=uYXDB2gIYbwC&amp;pg=PA133 p.133 sq]&lt;/ref&gt; The great Buddhist philosopher [[Dignāga|Dignaga]] taught his new doctrine there, and Nalanda remained a central place for the study of the theory of knowledge ([[pramana]]).&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt; Another major Buddhist university was [[Valabhi University|Valabhi]], in western India, which was second only to Nalanda in the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the Gupta style of [[Buddhist]] art spread along with the faith from south-east Asia to China. During this period, Chinese pilgrims also visited India to study Buddhism.

One of these pilgrims was [[Faxian]], who visited India during the reign of the Gupta emperor [[Chandragupta II]] in 405, and commented on the prosperity and mild administration of the Gupta empire. Another Chinese traveler who reached India after the end of the Guptas in the 7th century was [[Xuanzang]]. He reported in his travels across India that Buddhism was popular in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070324220145/http://www.upf.es/materials/huma/central/historia/xinamon/docums/budxidoc/miyaki.htm ''Personality of Xuanzang Sanzang'']&lt;/ref&gt; While reporting many deserted stupas in the area around modern day [[Nepal]] and the persecution of Buddhists by [[Shashanka]] in the Kingdom of [[Gauda Kingdom|Gauda]] in modern-day West Bengal,
[[Xuanzang]] complimented the patronage of emperor [[Harsha|Harṣavardana]] (c. 590–647 CE). [[Xuanzang]] also noted that in various regions [[Buddhism]] was giving way to [[Jainism]] and [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Buddhism in Andhra Pradesh, story of Buddhism'': {{cite web |url=http://www.indiaprofile.com/religion-culture/buddhisminandhra.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314205301/http://www.indiaprofile.com/religion-culture/buddhisminandhra.htm |archivedate=2007-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of [[Empire of Harsha|Harsha's empire]], the gangetic plain saw the rise of many small feuding kingdoms. This was to last until the rise of the [[Pala Empire|Pāla Empire]] (8th-12th centuries) arose in the [[Bengal]] region. The Pālas were stanch supporters of Buddhism, and build several important Buddhist centers, such as [[Vikramashila]], [[Somapura Mahavihara|Somapura]] and [[Odantapuri]].&lt;ref&gt;''Vajrayogini: Her Visualization, Rituals, and Forms'' by Elizabeth English. Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-329-X}} pg 15&lt;/ref&gt; They also supported older centers like Nalanda and Bodh Gaya. It was at these great Buddhist universities that scholars elaborated the philosophies of Abhidharma, Madhyamaka and Pramana, as well as the study of linguistics, medicine, astronomy, music, painting and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; Great Buddhist scholars such as [[Atisha]] and [[Santaraksita]] date from this period. Under the [[Pala Empire|Pāla]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, Mahāyāna Buddhism thus flourished and spread to [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]] and [[Sikkim]].

A milestone in the decline of Indian Buddhism in the North occurred in 1193 when [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] Islamic raiders under [[Muhammad Khilji]] burnt [[Nalanda|Nālandā]]. By the end of the 12th century, following the Islamic conquest of the Buddhist strongholds in [[Bihar]] and the loss of political support coupled with social pressures, the practice of Buddhism retreated to the Himalayan foothills in the North and [[Sri Lanka]] in the south. Additionally, the influence of Buddhism also waned due to Hinduism's revival movements such as [[Advaita]], and the rise of the [[bhakti movement]].

===Vajrayāna===

{{Main article|Vajrayana}}
Under the Gupta and Pala empires, a Tantric Buddhist movement arose, variously named [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]], Mantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism and Esoteric Buddhism. It promoted new practices such as the use of [[mantras]], [[Dharani|dharanis]], [[mudras]], [[mandalas]] and the visualization of deities and Buddhas and developed a new class of literature, the [[Buddhist Tantras]]. The movement can be traced back to groups of wandering yogis called [[Mahasiddha|mahasiddhas]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald A.; Indestructible Truth: The Living Spirituality of Tibetan Buddhism, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Various classes of Vajrayana literature developed as a result of royal courts sponsoring both Buddhism and [[Shaivism|Saivism]], especially the Buddhist Yogini tantras.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Alexis.

===Tibetan Buddhism===
{{See also|Tibetan Buddhist History|Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan art}}
Buddhism arrived late in Tibet, during the 7th century. The form that predominated, via the south of Tibet, was a blend of ''mahāyāna'' and ''vajrayāna'' from the universities of the [[Pala Empire|Pāla empire]] of the Bengal region in eastern India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Conze |first= Edward |authorlink= Edward Conze |authors= |editor= |others= |title= A Short History of Buddhism |airdate= |origyear= |month= |url= |accessdate= |edition=2nd |series= |volume= |date= |year=1993 |publisher= Oneworld |location= |language= |isbn=1-85168-066-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivādin]] influence came from the south west (Kashmir) &lt;ref&gt;Conze, 1993, 106&lt;/ref&gt; and the north west ([[Khotan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Berzin, Alexander (2000).

From the outset Buddhism was opposed by the native shamanistic [[Bon]] religion, which had the support of the aristocracy, but with royal patronage it thrived to a peak under King Rälpachän (817-836). Terminology in translation was standardised around 825, enabling a translation methodology that was highly literal. Despite a reversal in Buddhist influence which began under King Langdarma (836-842), the following centuries saw a colossal effort in collecting available Indian sources, many of which are now extant only in Tibetan translation. Tibetan Buddhism was favored above other religions by the rulers of imperial Chinese and Mongol [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271–1368).

Some of the earliest known Buddhist artifacts found in China are small statues on "money trees", dated c. 200 CE, in typical Gandhāran drawing style.&lt;ref&gt;''Crossroads of Asia'', p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; In the period between 460-525 CE during the [[Northern Wei dynasty]], the Chinese constructed [[Yungang Grottoes]], and the [[Longmen Grottoes]] which include some impressive monumental sculptures. In the fifth century, Chinese Buddhists also developed new schools and traditions, such as the [[Tiantai]] school, the [[Huayan|Huayen]] school, the [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] school and [[Chan Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, pp. 215-217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism continued to grow during the early [[Tang Dynasty]] (618&amp;ndash;907).

Buddhism recovered during the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279), which is known as the "golden age" of Chan.&lt;ref&gt;McRae, John (2003), Seeing Through Zen, The University Press Group Ltd, p 13, 19-21&lt;/ref&gt; During this period Chinese Chan influenced Korean and Japanese Buddhism.

===Vietnam===
{{Main article|Buddhism in Vietnam}}
There is disagreement on when exactly Buddhism arrived in [[Vietnam]]. Buddhism may have arrived as early as the 3rd or 2nd century BCE via India, or alternatively during the 1st or 2nd century from China.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen Tai Thu. ''The History of Buddhism in Vietnam''. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the case, [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] had been established by the second century CE in Vietnam. By the 9th century, both [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] and [[Vietnamese Thiền|Thien]] (Zen) were major Vietnamese Buddhist schools.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; In the southern [[Champa|Kingdom of Champa]], Hinduism, Theravada and Mahayana were all practiced until the 15th century, when an invasion from the north led to the dominance of Chinese-based forms of Buddhism. However Theravada Buddhism continues to exist in the south of Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese Buddhism is thus very similar to Chinese Buddhism and to some extent reflects the structure of Chinese Buddhism after the Song Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Prebish, Charles. Tanaka, Kenneth. ''The Faces of Buddhism in America.'' 1998. p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese Buddhism also has a symbiotic relationship with Taoism, Chinese spirituality and the native Vietnamese religion.

Buddhism was introduced to the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] beginning around 372 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/tps/300ce_ko.htm#buddhism|title=300 to 600 CE: Korea &amp;#124; Asia for Educators &amp;#124; Columbia University|date=|publisher=Afe.easia.columbia.edu|accessdate=2012-03-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222025814/http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/tps/300ce_ko.htm#buddhism|archivedate=2012-02-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 6th century, many Korean monks traveled to China and India to study Buddhism and various Korean Buddhist schools developed. Buddhism prospered in Korea during the [[Unified Silla|Silla]] period (688-935) when it became a dominant force in society.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism continued to be popular in the [[Goryeo]] period (918-1392), in particular Seon ([[Zen]]) Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Vermeersch, Sem. (2008). ''The Power of the Buddhas: the Politics of Buddhism during the Koryŏ Dynasty (918-1392),'' p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] Yi Dynasty of the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon period]], Buddhism faced a reversal of fortunes beginning with the confiscation of monastery lands, the closing of monasteries and the ban on ordination by aristocrats in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism was introduced to Japan in the 6th century by Korean monks bearing sutras and an image of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra, Yoshiko Kurata; De Bary, William Theodore (2001). ''Sources of Japanese tradition''. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 100. {{ISBN|0-231-12138-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Nara period|Nara Period]] (710–794), emperor [[Emperor Shōmu|Shōmu]] ordered the building of temples throughout his realm.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous temples and monasteries were built in the capital city of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], such as the five-story [[pagoda]] and Golden Hall of the [[Hōryū-ji]], or the [[Kōfuku-ji]] temple. There was also a proliferation of Buddhist sects in the capital city of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], known as the ''Nanto Rokushū'' (''the Six Nara Sects'').&lt;ref&gt;Powers, John (2000).

During the late Nara, the key figures of [[Kūkai]] (774–835) and [[Saichō]] (767–822) founded the influential Japanese schools of [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] and [[Tendai]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; An important doctrine for these schools was [[Hongaku]] (innate awakening or original enlightenment), a doctrine which was influential for all subsequent Japanese Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism also influenced the Japanese religion of [[Shinto]], which incorporated Buddhist elements.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the later [[Kamakura period]] (1185-1333), there were six new Buddhist schools founded which competed with the older Nara schools and are known as "New Buddhism" or ''Kamakura Buddhism.'' They include the influential [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] schools of [[Hōnen]] (1133–1212) and [[Shinran]] (1173–1263), the Rinzai and Soto schools of Zen founded by [[Eisai]] (1141–1215) and [[Dōgen]] (1200–1253) as well as the Lotus sutra school of [[Nichiren]] (1222–1282).&lt;ref&gt;Dobbins, James C.

[[Buddhist art in Japan|Japanese Buddhist art]] was especially productive between the 8th and 13th centuries during [[Nara period]] (710-794), [[Heian period]] (794-1185) and [[Kamakura period]] (1185-1333). Buddhism, especially Zen, remained culturally influential during the [[Ashikaga period]] (1333–1573) and the [[Edo period|Tokugawa era]] (1603–1867).

Since around 500 BCE, the culture of India has exerted influence on [[Southeast Asia]]n countries. Land and maritime trade routes linked India with the region and both Hindu and Buddhist beliefs became influential there during the period of the [[Indianization of Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth R.

University of Hawaii Press. p. 63. {{ISBN|978-0-8248-0843-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For more than a thousand years, Indian influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The [[Pāli]] and [[Sanskrit]] languages and Indian scripts, together with Theravāda and Mahāyāna Buddhism, [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]], and [[Hinduism]], were transmitted from direct contact and through sacred texts and Indian literature such as the [[Ramayana|Rāmāyaṇa]] and the [[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0112.xml "Hinduism in Southeast Asia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221234559/http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0112.xml |date=2016-12-21 }}.

From the 5th to the 13th centuries, South-East Asia saw a series of powerful states which were extremely active in the promotion of Buddhism and Buddhist art alongside of Hinduism. The main Buddhist influence now came directly by sea from the Indian subcontinent, so that these empires essentially followed the Mahāyāna faith. Examples include mainland kingdoms like [[Funan]], the [[Khmer Empire]] and the Thai [[Sukhothai Kingdom|kingdom of Sukhothai]] as well as Island kingdoms like the [[Kalingga Kingdom]], the [[Sri Vijaya|Srivijaya]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n Empire, [[Medang Kingdom]] and [[Majapahit]].

Buddhism monks traveled to China from the kingdom of [[Funan]] in the 5th century CE, bringing Mahayana texts, a sign that the religion was already established in the region by this point.&lt;ref&gt;''T'oung Pao: International Journal of Chinese Studies.'' 1958. p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism were the main religions of the [[Khmer Empire]] (802–1431), a state that dominated most of the South-East Asian peninsula during its time. Under the Khmer, numerous temples, both Hindu and Buddhist, were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. One of the greatest Khmer kings, [[Jayavarman VII]] (1181&amp;ndash;1219), built large Mahāyāna Buddhist structures at [[Bayon]] and [[Angkor Thom]].&lt;ref&gt;Higham, C. (2014). ''Early Mainland Southeast Asia''. Bangkok: River Books Co., Ltd., {{ISBN|9786167339443}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Indonesia|Indonesian]] island of [[Java]], Indianized kingdoms like the [[Kalingga Kingdom]] (6-7th centuries) were destinations for Chinese monks seeking out Buddhist texts.&lt;ref&gt;Drs. R. Soekmono, (1988) [First published in 1973]. Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2'', 2nd ed''. Yogyakarta: Penerbit Kanisius. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Malay [[Srivijaya]] (650–1377), a maritime empire centered on the island of [[Sumatra]], adopted Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna Buddhism and spread Buddhism to Java, Malaya and other regions they conquered.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross Cultural Contacts and Exchange in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese Buddhist [[Yijing]] described their capital at [[Palembang]] as a great center of Buddhist learning where the emperor supported over a thousand monks at his court.&lt;ref&gt;W., T. (1897). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25207848 "Review of A Record of the Buddhist Religion, as Practised in India and the Malay Archipelago (A.

''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland'': 358–364.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yijing]] also testified to the importance of Buddhism as early as the year 671 and advised future Chinese pilgrims to spend a year or two in [[Palembang]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bently, 'Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 72.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atisha|Atiśa]] studied there before travelling to [[Tibet]] as a missionary. As Srivijaya expanded, Buddhism thrived and also became part of a local [[syncretism]] that incorporated several different religions such as Hinduism and other indigenous traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bently, 'Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the island of Java, another kingdom also promoted Mahayana Buddhist culture, the [[Medang Kingdom]] (732–1006), a major rival of Srivijaya. They are known for their monumental [[Candi of Indonesia|temple construction]], especially the massive [[Borobudur]], as well as [[Kalasan]], [[Sewu]], and [[Prambanan]].&lt;ref&gt;Munoz, Paul Michel (2006).

==Modern period==
{{Further information|Buddhist modernism}}

The [[Modern history|modern era]] brought new challenges to the Buddhist religion such as the colonization of traditionally Buddhist Asian countries by Western states, which weakened the traditional political structures which supported the religion as well as criticism and competition from [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; Modern wars, communism, the growth of capitalism, science and regional political instability are also influential pressures on modern Buddhism.

In [[Sri Lanka]] under the British, [[Christian mission|Christian missionaries]] ran all the state approved schools and strongly criticized Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; By 1865, Buddhist monks began a counter movement against Christian attacks, printing pamphlets and debating Christians in public, such as at the famous Panadura debate in 1873, which saw the monk [[Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera|Gunananda]] win a debate in front of a crowd of 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period a new form of Buddhism began to take shape, termed [[Buddhist modernism]], which tended to see the Buddha as a simple human being and Buddhism as a rational, scientific religion.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Important figures in this new movement include the American convert [[Henry Steel Olcott|Henry Olcott]] (1832– 1907) and [[Anagarika Dharmapala]]  (1864–1933), who promoted Buddhist schools, lay organizations and the printing of newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Dharmapala also founded the [[Maha Bodhi Society|Mahā Bodhi Society]] to restore the dilapidated Indian site of Bodh Gaya.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Dharmapala also traveled to the UK and the USA to teach Buddhism.  

This society helped usher in a [[History_of_Buddhism_in_India#Revival_of_Buddhism_in_India|revival of Buddhism in India]], where Buddhism became popular among some Indian intellectuals. &lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was the lawyer [[B. R. Ambedkar]] (1891–1956), leader of the [[Dalit Buddhist movement]], who urged low caste Indian [[Dalit|Dalits]] to convert to Buddhism.  

In [[Myanmar|Burma]], a central modern figure is [[King Mindon]] (r. 1853–78), who presided over the [[Fifth Buddhist council|5th Buddhist council]] (1868-71) where different editions of the [[Pāli Canon|Pali Canon]] where cross checked and a final version was inscribed on [[Tripiṭaka tablets at Kuthodaw Pagoda|729 stone slabs, currently still the world's largest book]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt; A new meditation movement arose, called the [[Vipassana movement]], beginning with figures such as [[Medawi]] (1728–1816), who was instrumental in the promotion of Buddhist meditation practices.&lt;ref&gt;Pranke, Patrick. On saints and wizards, Ideals of human perfection and power in contemporary Burmese Buddhism&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Burmese politician [[U Nu]] presided over the [[Sixth Buddhist council|sixth council]], which saw monks from various Theravada countries produce a new edition of the [[Pāli Canon|Pali Canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Buddhist monks were involved in political protest movements such as the [[Saffron Revolution]] of 2007.

[[Thailand]], which was the only country to avoid colonization, had two important Buddhist kings, who pushed for modernization and reformation of the Buddhist sangha. They were [[Mongkut|King Mongkut]] (r. 1851–68), and his son [[Chulalongkorn|King Chulalongkorn]] (r. 1868–1910), who were responsible for several key modern reforms of [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Two recent Thai modernist movements are the monastic revival of the [[Thai Forest Tradition|Thai forest tradition]] and the [[Wat Phra Dhammakaya|Wat Phra Dhammakāya]] movement.

From 1893, [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]] were all French colonies. The Communists came to power in Laos in 1975. There was no widespread repression of the Buddhist sangha, but the communist government has sought to control the sangha and use it as a tool to spread its ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; In Cambodia however, the communist terror of the [[Khmer Rouge|Khmer rouge]] during 1975-9 caused much damage to the Buddhist sangha.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== East Asia ===
The [[Perry Expedition|opening of Japan in 1853]] by [[Robert Peary|Admiral Perry]] and the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868 led to the end of feudal Japan and rapid modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; A new form of [[State Shinto]] arose as a strong competitor to Buddhism when it was adopted by the Japanese government. In 1872, the Japanese government decreed that Buddhist clerics could marry. These changes led to modernization efforts by [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhism]] which saw the setting up of publishing houses and the study of Western philosophy and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; In the post war period, [[Japanese new religions]] arose, many of them influenced by Buddhism.

Chinese Buddhism meanwhile, suffered much destruction during the Christian-inspired [[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping rebellion]] (1850-64), but saw a modest revival during the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republican period]] (1912-49).&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; A key figure was [[Taixu]] (T’ai-hsü, 1899–1947), who is associated with the modernist [[Humanistic Buddhism]] trend of Chinese Buddhism. The Communist [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–76) led to the closing of all Buddhist monasteries and widespread destruction of Buddhist institutions. However, since 1977, there has been a general shift in the policy of the communist government, and Buddhist activity, both monastic and lay, has once again been renewed.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 409-10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Korean Buddhism]] suffered a series of setbacks during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|Japanese invasions]], occupation, and also during the [[Korean War|Korean war]]. [[North Korea]]'s harsh government nevertheless offers some limited support to the sangha, but it closely controls all activity. In [[South Korea]], Buddhism underwent a revival, with youth groups being influential and temples being rebuilt with government aid.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Donald N.

[[Tibet]] remained a traditional theocratic state (the [[Ganden Phodrang]]) with the [[Dalai Lama|Dalai Lamas]] at the head, until the Chinese [[Battle of Chamdo|communist invasion in 1950]]. The [[14th Dalai Lama]] fled the country in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Tibetan diaspora|Tibetan exile community]] was established in India, with its center at [[Dharamshala|Dharamsala]], which today contains many Buddhist monasteries. The 14th Dalai Lama has become one of the most popular Buddhist leaders in the world today. 

During the Red Guard period (1966-7), Chinese communists destroyed around 6,000 monasteries in Tibet along with their art and books, an attempt to wipe out the Tibetan Buddhist culture.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1980, Chinese repression of Tibetan Buddhism has decreased and the situation has improved with the reprinting of the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan Canon]] and some artistic restoration.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt; In the nearby countries of [[Bhutan]], and [[Nepal]], [[Tibetan Buddhism|Vajrayana Buddhism]] continues to flourish as a major religion.

In [[Mongolia]], which also has Tibetan Buddhism as its main religion, soviet dominance (between 1924-1990) saw much repression of Buddhism. However, Buddhism is now undergoing a revival in post communist Mongolia, with more ordained monks and nuns, and 284 monasteries since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent liberal attitudes towards religion has also benefited the Buddhists of [[Tuva]] and [[Buryatia]], as well as the Chinese region of [[Inner Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another modern development was the founding of the [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk Khanate]] in the 17th century with [[Tibetan Buddhism]] as its main religion. During the course of the 18th century, they were absorbed by the [[Russian Empire]] as [[Kalmykia]], and remains a federal subject of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060202154501/http://www.nupi.no/cgi-win/Russland/etnisk_b.exe?Kalmykian ''NUPI - Centre for Russian Studies'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved November 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the 19th century, Western intellectuals became more aware of Buddhism through various contacts such as colonial servants, administrators, and Christian missionaries. Sir Edwin Arnold's book-length poem ''[[The Light of Asia]]'' (1879), a life of the Buddha, was a successful early publication on Buddhism that led to much interest among English speaking middle classes.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, 420.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of western [[Buddhist studies|Buddhist scholars]] like [[Hermann Oldenberg]] (1854–1920), [[Thomas Rhys Davids|T. W. Rhys Davids]] (1843– 1922) and [[Max Müller|F. Max Müller]] was also influential in introducing Buddhism to western audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 19th century also saw the first-known modern western conversions to Buddhism, including leading Theosophists [[Henry Steel Olcott]] and [[Helena Blavatsky]] in 1880 in [[Sri Lanka]]. The Theosophical Society was very influential in popularizing Indian religions in the west. &lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, 421.&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th century also saw the first western monastics such as [[U Dhammaloka]], [[Charles Henry Allan Bennett|Ananda Metteyya]] and the German [[Nyanatiloka|Nyānatiloka Thera]] (1878–1956). 

Another important element leading to the growth of Buddhism in the west was the large scale immigration of Chinese and Japanese to the United States and Canada in late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, 424.&lt;/ref&gt; Refugees from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia have also immigrated to west, beginning in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, 426.&lt;/ref&gt; Asian Buddhists such as [[D. T. Suzuki|DT Suzuki]], [[Hsuan Hua|Hsüan Hua]], [[Hakuun Yasutani]] and [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]] were influential in teaching [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]] in the West in the 20th century. [[Shunryū Suzuki|Shunryu Suzuki]] opened the [[Sōtō|Soto]] [[San Francisco Zen Center]] (1961) and the [[Tassajara Zen Mountain Center|Tassajara Monastery]] (1967).&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, 432.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Tibetan diaspora]] has also been active in promoting Tibetan Buddhism in the West. All of the four major Tibetan Buddhist schools have a presence and have attracted converts.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, 437.&lt;/ref&gt; Among its prominent exponents have been [[14th Dalai Lama|Lama Thubten Zopa]], [[Tarthang Tulku]] and [[Chögyam Trungpa]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, 437-38&lt;/ref&gt; The number of its adherents is estimated to be between ten and twenty million.&lt;ref&gt;Adherents.com estimates twenty million for "Lamaism (Vajrayana/Tibetan/Tantric)." http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#Buddhism {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803172321/http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html |date=2017-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theravada tradition has established various temples in the West, especially among immigrant communities in the USA. Theravada [[Vipassanā|vipassana]] meditation was also established in the West, through the founding of institutions like the [[Insight Meditation Society]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gil Fronsdal|Fronsdal, Gil]] (1998). [http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/articles/InsightinUS.pdf "Insight Meditation in the United States: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327142556/http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/articles/InsightinUS.pdf |date=2014-03-27 }} in C.S. Prebish &amp; K.K. Tanaka (1998), ''The Faces of Buddhism in America'', University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thai Forest Tradition|Thai forest tradition]] has also established communities in the USA and in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. In the UK, the [[Triratna Buddhist Community]] arose as a new modern Buddhist movement.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Buddhism in Europe|Continental Europe]], interest in Buddhism also increased during the late 20th century, with an exponential increase in [[Buddhism in Germany|Buddhist groups in countries like Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Buddhism in France|France]] and Spain, Tibetan Buddhism has the largest following.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 454, 456&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan, East Asian and Theravada traditions are now also present and active in [[Buddhism in Australia|Australia]] and [[Buddhism in New Zealand|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan and Zen Buddhism also have established a small presence in [[Buddhism in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Buddhism in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 2012, p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The expansion of Buddhism to the west in the 20th century has made the religion a worldwide phenomenon.

'''[[Islam]] in Guyana''' is the third largest religion in the country after Christianity and Hinduism, respectively. According to the 2002 census, 7.3% of the country is Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statisticsguyana.gov.gy/pubs/CensusReport2002.pdf|title=The Republic of Guyana: The Census Road|last=Benjamin|first=Lennox|date=2002|website=Bureau of Statistics|page=7|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101024759/http://www.statisticsguyana.gov.gy/pubs/CensusReport2002.pdf|archivedate=1 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a Pew Research survey from 2010 estimates that 6.4% of the country is Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projection-table/|title=Religious Composition by Country, 2010-2050|last=|first=|last2=|date=2015-04-02|website=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|access-date=2017-04-20|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam was first introduced to Guyana via slaves from West Africa, but was suppressed on plantations. Thus, the religion really gained a foothold after the mid 19th century when indentured servants and slaves from South Asia were brought to the country.{{sfn|Chickrie|1999|p=181}} After Guyana gained its independence in 1966, the country strengthened its ties with the Middle East and other parts of the greater [[Muslim world]]. In 1998, Guyana joined the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.{{sfn|Chickrie|1999|p=188}}

The Islamic holidays of [[Eid al-Adha]], [[Eid al-Fitr]] and [[Mawlid]] (the birthday of [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]]) are nationally recognized in Guyana. The dates for these holidays vary according to the [[Islamic calendar]].{{sfn|Chickrie|1999|p=181}}

== History ==
As with most South American countries, [[Islam]] spread to Guyana through the [[Atlantic slave trade|transtlantic slave trade]]. [[Mandingo people of Sierra Leone|Mandingo]] and [[Fula people|Fulani]] Muslims were brought from [[West Africa]] to work as slaves in Guyana's sugar plantations. However, the oppressive conditions of slavery in the colony led the practice of Islam to essentially disappear until 1838 when 240,000 [[South Asia]]ns were brought from modern-day [[Company rule in India|India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan]].{{sfn|Chickrie|1999|p=182}} Records from the time show that while overwhelming majority of these servants were [[Hindu]], a significant minority were [[Muslim]].{{sfn|Chickrie|1999|p=183}} After Guyana's independence from the British in 1966, Guyana established diplomatic relations with [[Arab people|Arab]] countries such as [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]] and [[Libya]] who opened embassies in the capital of [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]]. Some Muslim youths went to [[Saudi Arabia]], Egypt and Libya to study Islamic theology and the [[Arabic language]]. In 1996, President [[Cheddi Jagan]] of Guyana toured [[Syria]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Lebanon]] and appointed a Middle Eastern envoy. In the same year, Guyana officially became a permanent observer in the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organization of Islamic Conference]] (OIC). In 1998, Guyana became the 56th [[Member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|full member state of the OIC]].{{sfn|Chickrie|1999|p=188}}

== Culture ==
[[Hindi language|Hindi]] is popular among Indo-Guyanese Muslims who watch films and listen to music from [[Bollywood]].{{sfn|Chickrie|1999|p=185}}

==Interfaith cooperation==
According to Guyanese-American professor Raymond Chickrie, Hindus and Muslims in Guyana have always had "a cordial relationship among themselves. It would seem that these two groups had come to a mutual understanding of respecting each other's space while culturally and even linguistically identifying with each other."{{sfn|Chickrie|1999|p=181}} Civic leader Richard David states that interfaith marriages between Muslims and Christians or Muslims and Hindus is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://queenstribune.com/guyanese-in-new-york-from-a-small-country-came-immigrants-with-big-dreams/|title=Guyanese In New York: From A Small Country Came Immigrants With Big Dreams|last=Cronin|first=Jon|date=26 May 2016|website=Queens Tribune|language=|access-date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Islam by country}}
'''Islam in Jamaica''' is a [[minority group|minority]] religious affiliation. [[Muslim]]s arrived in [[Jamaica]] through waves of immigration from [[Africa]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]], and today make up a population of about 5,000 with several [[mosque]]s and [[Islamic festival|festivals]].

==History==
The first Muslims in Jamaica were West African Moors captured in the [[Reconquista]]  sold as slaves to traders, and brought to Jamaica on ships.&lt;ref&gt;Kettani, A. (1986). Muslim Minorities in the World Today. London: Mansell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Over time most of them lost their Islamic identity due to forced mixing of ethnic groups.  Mu’minun of African descent belonging to the Islamic nations of Mandinka, Fula, Susu, Ashanti and Hausa ceaselessly tried to maintain their Islamic practices in secrecy,
while working as slaves on the plantations in Jamaica.  By the time the slaves were liberated, much of the Muslim faith of the past had faded, and the freed slaves picked up the faith of their slave masters.

About 16 percent of the 37,000 indentured [[India]]n immigrants who arrived to Jamaica between 1845 and 1917 were Muslims{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. Muhammad Khan, who came to Jamaica in 1915 at the age of 15, built Masjid Ar-Rahman in [[Spanish Town]] in 1957, while [[Westmoreland, Jamaica|Westmoreland's]] Masjid Hussein was built by Muhammad Golaub, who immigrated with his father at the age of 7. The indentured Muslims laid the foundation of the eight other masjids established in Jamaica since the 1960s{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}, with the advent of an indigenous Jamaican Muslim community that now forms the majority of the Muslim populace on the island.

==Current demography==
The statistics for Islam in Jamaica estimate a total [[Muslim]] population of about 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90259.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Jamaica]&lt;/ref&gt; There are several [[Islamic]] organizations and [[mosques]] in [[Jamaica]], including the Islamic Council of Jamaica and the Islamic Education and Dawah Center, both located in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] and offering classes in Islamic studies and daily prayers in congregation. Outside Kingston organizations include Masjid Al Haq in [[Mandeville, Jamaica|Mandeville]], Masjid Al-Ihsan in [[Negril]], Masjid-Al-Hikmah in [[Ocho Rios]], the Port Maria Islamic Center in [[Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica|Saint Mary]] and the [[Ahmadiyya]] Mahdi Mosque in [[Old Harbour, Jamaica|Old Harbour]].

==Festivals Practised==
These are the main Islamic Festivals practised by Jamaican Muslims:

* The [[Ramadan]] Fast
* [[Ashura]]
* [[Id al Fitr]] (or Eid-Ul-Fitr)
* [[Eid al Adha]] (or Id-al-Kabir)
* [[Mawlid]]
* [[Miraj]]
* [[Hijrah]]

Islam spread to the [[Republic of the Congo]] from [[North Africa]] in the mid-19th century.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/congo/spirit.html www.cp-pc.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Muslim]] community in the country is estimated at 1.3 percent of the population. In 2005 a large new mosque was constructed in [[Brazzaville]]. Most workers in the urban centers were immigrants from [[West Africa]] and [[Lebanon]], with some also from North Africa. The West African immigrants arrived mostly from [[Mali]], [[Benin]], [[Togo]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Senegal]]. The Lebanese were primarily [[Sunni Muslims]]. There was also a large [[Chad]]ian Muslim population.

Muslim holy days are not nationally observed; however, they are respected. Employers grant leave for those who wish to observe holy days not on the national calendar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71296.htm www.state.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Gordon Melton''' (born September 19, 1942) is an American religious scholar who was the founding director of the Institute for the Study of American Religion and is currently the Distinguished Professor of American Religious History with the Institute for Studies of Religion at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, where he resides.&lt;ref name=MeltonDistinguishedProfessor&gt;[http://www.baylorisr.org/about-isr/distinguished-professors/j-gordon-melton/] Baylor University, "J. Gordon Melton, Distinguished Professor of American Religious History. Retrieved 12 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; He is also an ordained minister in the [[United Methodist Church]].

Melton is the author of more than forty-five books, including several encyclopedias, handbooks, and scholarly textbooks on American religious history, Methodism, world religions, and new religious movements (NRMs). His areas of research include major [[religion|religious]] traditions, American Methodism, [[new religious movement|new and alternative religions]], Western Esotericism (popularly called [[occultism]]) and [[parapsychology]], [[New Age]], and Dracula and [[vampire]] studies. He has been an advocate of religious freedom and was involved in the scholarly debates on the legitimacy of some NRMs and in establishing the field of new religion studies in academia.

==Early life==
Melton was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], the son of Burnum Edgar Melton and Inez Parker. During his senior year in high school he came across ''The Small Sects in America'' by Elmer T. Clark and became interested in reading as much as possible on alternative religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Melton | first = J. Gordon |title = Finding Enlightenment: Ramtha's School of Ancient Wisdom | publisher = Beyond Words Publishing, Inc. | date =1998 | location = Hillsboro, OR | pages = 163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 he graduated from [[Birmingham Southern College]] with the B.A. degree and then proceeded to theological studies at [[Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary]], from which he received an M.Div. with a concentration in church history in 1968. He married Dorothea Dudley in 1966, with one daughter, Melanie. The marriage ended in divorce in 1979. His second wife is named Suzie.&lt;ref name=MeltonDistinguishedProfessor /&gt;

In 1968, Melton was ordained as an elder in the [[United Methodist]] church, an appointment he retains to this day. He was the pastor of the United Methodist church in [[Wyanet, Illinois|Wyanet]], [[Illinois]] (1974–75), and then at [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], Illinois (1975–80). He was also a member of the [[Spiritual Frontiers Fellowship]].

Melton pursued further graduate studies at [[Northwestern University]] where he received his Ph.D. in 1975 in the History and Literature of Religions with a specialty in American history. His doctoral dissertation surveyed some 800 religious groups known to exist in the United States at the time and led to the development of a classification system that has come to be widely used.

==Methodology and writing==
Much of Melton's professional career has involved literary and field research into alternative and minority religious bodies. In taking his cue from the writings of Elmer Clark, Melton has spent much of his career identifying, counting and classifying the many different churches, major religious traditions, and new and alternative religions found in North America. His ''Encyclopedia of American Religions'', which was originally published in 1978 (ninth ed. 2016), has become the standard reference work in the field.

Other noteworthy reference works include his ''Biographical Dictionary of American Cult and Sect Leaders'', ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology'', ''New Age Almanac'', and ''Prime-time Religion'' (co-authored with Phillip Charles Lucas and Jon R. Stone). He has also acted as the series editor for six multi-volume series of reference books: ''American Religious Creeds'', ''Religions of the World'', ''The Churches Speak'', ''Cults and New Religions'', ''Sects and Cults in America Bibliographical Guides'', and ''Religious Information Systems Series''.

He is a contributor to academic journals such as ''Syzygy'', and ''Nova Religio''. He has also contributed chapters to various multi-authored books on new religions, and articles in many other reference works, handbooks and encyclopedias of religion.  He has contributed 15 ''[[Micropædia]]'' articles, generally on religious organizations or movements: [[Aum Shinrikyo]], [[Branch Davidian]], [[Christian Science]], [[Church Universal and Triumphant|Church Universal]], [[Eckankar]], Evangelical Church, [[Family International|The Family]], [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]], [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[New Age Movement]], [[Pentecostalism]], [[People's Temple]], [[Scientology]], and [[Wicca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| year = 2007 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | volume = [[Propædia]], volume 30 | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] | location = [[New York City|New York]] | page = 589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main areas of research ==

===Phenomenology of Religion===
Melton's major emphasis has been on collating primary source data on religious groups and movements. His approach to research is shaped by his training both in church and religious history and in the [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of religion. His methodology has followed that of a historian seeking primary source literature, and so he has generally made direct, personal contact with the leaders or official representatives of a church or religious group. The purpose of such contact has been to obtain the group's main religious literature to ascertain their principal teachings and practices. His inquiries also comprise, gathering membership statistics, details of the group's history and so forth. He then incorporates these details profiles that form the basis for reference texts like the ''Encyclopedia of American Religions''.

Melton uses a group's religious texts as the essential mainstay for reporting about a group before then proceeding to scholarly questions and analysis about wider social, religious and historical contexts.

===Christian countercult and secular anti-cult===
Melton is one of the first scholars to draw a distinction between the [[Christian countercult movement|Christian countercult]] and the secular [[anti-cult movement]]s. In his ''Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America'' he articulated the distinction on the grounds that the two movements operate with very different [[epistemological|epistemologies]], motives and methods.&lt;ref name=MeltonEncycCultsAmerica&gt;{{cite book | last = Melton | first = J. Gordon |title = Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America | publisher = Garland| date = 1992 | location = New York | pages = 335–358}} He makes a similar distinction in {{cite journal | title = The Couther-cult Monitoring Movement in Historical Perspective | journal = Challenging Religion: Essays in Honour of Eileen Barker | last1 = Richardson | first1 = James A. |last2 = Richardson | first2 = James T. | year = 2003 | pages = 102–113.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was urged to make this distinction in the course of a formal dialogue with evangelical sociologist [[Ronald Enroth]] and after conversations with Eric Pement of ''[[Cornerstone (magazine)|Cornerstone]]'' magazine (Chicago).&lt;ref name=EnrothWhyCultsSucceed&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Enroth | first1 = Ronald M. | last2 = Melton | first2 = J. Gordon |title = Why Cults Succeed Where the Church Fails | publisher = Brethren | date = 1985 | location = Elgin, IL | pages = 25–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PementComments&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Tolbert | editor-first1 = Keith Edward | editor-last2 = Pement | editor-first2 = Eric | last = Pement | first = Eric | chapter = Comments on the Directory | title = The 1993 Directory of Cult Research Organizations | publisher = American Religions Center | location = Trenton, NJ | year = 1993 | page = x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction has been subsequently acknowledged by sociologists such as [[Douglas E. Cowan]] and [[Eileen Barker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cowan | first = Douglas |

 location = Waco, TX | publisher = J. M. Dawson Institute of Church-State Studies | date = 2002 |
 pages = 1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melton is a prominent critic of both the anti-cult movement and some Christian countercult organizations. Some of Melton's criticisms concerning the secular anti-cult movement revolve around his rejection of the concept of [[brainwashing]] as an explanation of religious conversion and indoctrination. During the 1970s and 1980s he was a prominent opponent of the controversial methods of [[deprogramming]]. He argued that deprogramming violated civil liberties and the [[religious freedom]] principles guaranteed in the [[US Constitution]] and that the efficacy of deprogramming or counter-brainwashing stratagems was doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Melton | first = J. Gordon | title = Brainwashing and the Cults: The Rise and Fall of a Theory | url = http://www.cesnur.org/testi/melton.htm | date = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melton has argued that countercult apologists frequently misrepresent the teachings of those they critique:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
My encounter with many Evangelical Christians who write about other religions has, to some extent, helped shape my life's work. However, over the years I have been mostly disappointed with the Christian writing in this area. Instead of attempting to understand the teachings of a group, too frequently writers only compared quotes from the group's literature with biblical passages, both often out of context. Then, as I began to visit the groups, I often encountered the anger at the church many members had because of Christian writers who had written supposedly authoritative books but who had distorted members' positions and had condemned them for believing things they had never taught ... I have always thought the church deserved better, and many years ago I committed myself to providing it with the information it needed both to live at peace with its new neighbors and to carry on its missional life with a high level of integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Melton | first = J. Gordon |title = Finding Enlightenment: Ramtha's School of Ancient Wisdom | publisher = Beyond Words Publishing, Inc. | date =1998 | location = Hillsboro, OR | pages = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Melton challenges the validity of many anti-NRM sources and testimonies of former members (which he refers to as [[apostate]]s) critical of their previous groups. While testifying as an expert witness in a lawsuit, Melton asserted that when investigating groups, one should not rely solely upon the unverified testimony of ex-members, and that hostile ex-members would invariably shade the truth and blow out of proportion minor incidents turning them into major incidents.&lt;ref name=CFF&gt;{{cite web | title = The Experts Speak—John Gordon Melton, Ph.D. | url = http://contendingforthefaith.org/en/the-experts-speak-j-gordon-melton-ph-d/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melton also follows the argumentation of [[Lewis Carter]] and [[David G. Bromley|David Bromley]] and claims that as a result of their study, the treatment (coerced or voluntary) of former members as people in need of psychological assistance largely ceased and that an (alleged) lack of widespread need for psychological help by former members of new religions would in itself be the strongest evidence refuting early sweeping condemnations of new religions as causes of psychological trauma.&lt;ref name=CFF /&gt; This view is shared by several religious scholars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |

=== New Age ===
In a paper presented at the conference on "New Age in the Old World" held at the Institut Oecumenique de Bossey, [[Céligny]], Switzerland, Melton presented his views on the New Age movement, stating that it led to a dramatic growth of the older occult/metaphysical community, and created a much more positive image for [[occultism]] in Western culture. He stated that the New Age movement itself had died after its promises of a new age of enlightenment failed to materialize but that the community of people it brought together has grown to be "one of the most important minority faith communities in the West."&lt;ref&gt;Melton, J Gordon "New Age Transformed", a paper presented at the conference on "New Age in the Old World" held at the Institut Oecumenique de Bossey, Celigny, Switzerland, July 17–21, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vampirism research===
From his college days, Melton developed an interest in the subject of vampires, which he has since pursued in his leisure time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mardas | first1 = John | title = Interview with J. Gordon Melton | journal = Speak Magazine | volume = 2 | date = Summer 2000 | url = http://www.cesnur.org/testi/melton_speak.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melton has researched the history of [[vampire]]s, as well as the study of contemporary vampiric groups and rites. In 1983 he served as editor for ''Vampires Unearthed'' by Martin Riccardo, the first comprehensive bibliography of English-language vampire literature. In 1994 he completed ''The Vampire Book: An Encyclopedia of the Undead''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Melton | first = John Gordon | title = Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology | edition = 5 | publisher = [[Gale (publisher)|Gale Group]] | date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written ''The Vampire Gallery: A Who's Who of the Undead''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Melton | first = John Gordon | title = [[Contemporary Authors Online]] | publisher = [[Gale (publisher)|Thomson Gale]] | date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently ''The Vampire in Folklore, History, Literature, Film and Television: A Comprehensive Bibliography'' (2016).

In 1997, Melton, [[Massimo Introvigne]] and [[Elizabeth Miller (academic)|Elizabeth Miller]] organized an event at the Westin Hotel in Los Angeles where 1,500 attendees (some dressed as vampires) came for a "creative writing contest, Gothic rock music and theatrical performances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bidwell | first = Carol | title = Coffin Break to Vampires Everywhere, Fangs for the Memories | newspaper = [[The Los Angeles Daily News]] | date = July 23, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the TSD annual colloquium, "Therapy and Magic in Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' and beyond" held in Romania in 2004, it was announced that Melton and Introvigne would be participating in the TSD conference "Buffy, the vampire slayer", in [[Nashville, TN]] in 2004. Melton was identified as the "Count Dracula Ambassador to the U.S".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Buffy, the vampire slayer | url = http://www.cesnur.org/2004/vamp_04.htm | date = May 28–30, 2004 | place = Nashville, TN}}. [[CESNUR]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; Melton was the president of the American chapter (now defunct) ''The [[Transylvanian Society of Dracula]]'' (TSD), an international organization of Dracula and vampire studies scholars and researchers, (which disbanded in 2016).

==Amicus curiae==
Melton, together with a group of scholars and the [[American Psychological Association]], submitted on February 10, 1987 an ''[[amicus curiæ]]'' brief in a pending case before the [[California Supreme Court]] related to the [[Unification Church]]. The brief stated that hypotheses of [[brainwashing]] and [[coercive persuasion]] were uninformed speculations based on skewed data. The brief characterized the theory of brainwashing as not scientifically proven and advanced the position that "commitment to advancing the appropriate use of psychological testimony in the courts carries with it the concomitant duty to be vigilant against those who would use purportedly expert testimony lacking scientific and methodological rigor."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cesnur.org/testi/molko_brief.htm APA Brief in the Molko Case]." The brief stated that "the methodology of Drs. Singer and Benson has been repudiated by the scientific community," APA later withdrew as a signatory because of a pending report from the Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control (DIMPAC), chaired by Margaret Singer ([http://www.cesnur.org/testi/molko_motion.htm Motion of APA to withdraw as amicus curiae in the Molko case, March 27, 1987]). However, when DIMPAC submitted its final report, the APA's Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology rejected it, saying  "the report lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur" ([http://www.cesnur.org/testi/APA.htm APA's Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) Memorandum of May 11, 1987]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aum Shinrikyo investigation ==
{{details|Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway}}
In May 1995, in the early stages of investigations into the [[sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway]], Melton, fellow scholar [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] and religious freedom lawyer Barry Fisher flew to Japan to voice concern that police behaviour, including mass detentions without charge and the removal of practitioners' children from the group, might be infringing the civil rights of [[Aum Shinrikyo]] members.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost /&gt;&lt;ref name=Reader /&gt; They had travelled to Japan at the invitation and expense of Aum Shinrikyo after they had contacted the group to express concern over developments, and met with officials over a period of three days.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost /&gt; While not having been given access to the group's chemical laboratories, they held press conferences in Japan stating their belief, based on the documentation they had been given by the group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.apologeticsindex.org/a06ae.html | title = Aum Shinrikyo | last = Hein | first = Anton | date = 2005 | website = Apologetics Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the group did not have the ability to produce sarin and was being scapegoated.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost&gt;"Tokyo Cult Finds an Unlikely Supporter", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', T.R. Reid, May 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reader&gt;Ian Reader, [http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/14563/1/nr.2000.3.2.pdf "Scholarship, Aum Shinrikyo, and Academic Integrity"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005112225/http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/14563/1/nr.2000.3.2.pdf |date=2011-10-05 }}, ''[[Nova Religio]]'' 3, no. 2 (April 2000): 368-82.&lt;/ref&gt; Melton revised his judgment shortly after, concluding that the group had in fact been responsible for the attack and other crimes.&lt;ref name=Reader /&gt; Some felt that the scholars' defense of Aum Shinrikyo led to a crisis of confidence in religious scholarship when the group's culpability was proven.&lt;ref name=Reader /&gt;

==Criticism==
Melton's scholarly works concentrate on the phenomenology and not the theology of NRMs. Some Christian countercultists criticize Melton for not critiquing the groups he reports on from an evangelical perspective, arguing that his failure to do so is incompatible with his statements of professed evangelicalism.

'''Jesse Ventura''' (born '''James George Janos'''; July 15, 1951) is an American [[media personality]], actor, author, former politician and retired [[professional wrestler]], who served as the [[List of Governors of Minnesota|38th Governor of Minnesota]] from 1999 to 2003. He was the first and only candidate of the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] to win a major government position, but later joined the [[Green Party of the United States]].

Ventura was a member of the [[U.S. Navy]] [[Underwater Demolition Team]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="Military People: Jesse Ventura"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryhub.com/military-people.cfm?id=42|title=More than Military|publisher=MilitaryHub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving the military, he embarked on a professional wrestling career from 1975 to 1986, taking the [[ring name]] '''Jesse''' "'''The Body'''" '''Ventura'''. He had a long tenure in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) as a performer and [[color commentator]], and was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2004)|class of 2004]].&lt;ref name=OWOW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/bios/j/jesse-ventura/|title=OWOW profile|accessdate=December 29, 2012|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to wrestling, Ventura pursued an acting career, appearing in films such as ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' and ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'' (both 1987).

Ventura first entered politics as Mayor of [[Brooklyn Park, Minnesota]], from 1991 to 1995. Ventura was the [[Reform Party (United States)|Reform Party]] candidate in the [[Minnesota gubernatorial election, 1998|Minnesota gubernatorial election of 1998]], running a low-budget campaign centered on grassroots events and unusual ads that urged citizens not to "vote for politics as usual". Ventura's campaign was unexpectedly successful, with him narrowly defeating both the Democratic and Republican candidates. The highest elected official to ever win an election on a Reform Party ticket, Ventura left the Reform Party a year after taking office amid internal fights for control over the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ventura Will Quit Reform Party Today, Minn. Official Reports|url=http://articles.philly.com/2000-02-11/news/25576039_1_russ-verney-minnesota-reform-party-independence-party}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As governor, Ventura oversaw reforms of Minnesota's [[property tax]] as well as the state's first sales tax rebate. Other initiatives taken under Ventura included construction of the [[Metro Blue Line (Minnesota)|METRO Blue Line]] light rail in the [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul]] metropolitan area, and cuts in income taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCallum|first=Laura|title=The political legacy of Jesse Ventura|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200212/17_mccalluml_venturalegacy/|publisher=minnesota.publicradio.org|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khoo|first=Michael|title=The days of Jesse|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200212/16_khoom_ventura/|publisher=minnesota.publicradio.org|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ventura left office in 2003, deciding not to run for re-election. After leaving office, Ventura became a [[visiting fellow]] at [[Harvard University]]'s [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] in 2004. He has since also hosted a number of television shows and has written several political books. Ventura remains politically active and currently hosts a show on [[Ora TV]] and on [[RT America]] called ''Off the Grid''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ora.tv/offthegrid |title=Off The Grid |publisher=Ora.Tv |date=June 26, 2014 |accessdate=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2017, Ventura is hosting a variety news show on [[RT (TV network)|RT]] called ''The World According to Jesse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/shows/the-world-according-to-jesse/|title=The World According to Jesse|last=|first=|date=|website=Russia Today|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ventura has repeatedly floated running for [[President of the United States]] on a [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tmz.com/2018/11/28/jesse-ventura-running-president-trump-wrestlemania/|title=Jesse Ventura Considering Running For President, 'Trump will not Have a Chance!'|work=TMZ|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Navy===
Near the end of his service in the Navy, Ventura began to spend time with the "South Bay" chapter of the [[Mongols (motorcycle club)|Mongols]] motorcycle club in [[San Diego]]. He would ride onto [[Naval Base Coronado]] on his [[Harley-Davidson]] wearing his Mongol colors. According to Ventura, he was a full-patch member of the club and even third-in-command of his chapter, but he never had any problems with the authorities.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Jesse Ventura |last=Cohen |first=Daniel|year=2001 |publisher=Lerner Publishing Group |location= |isbn=978-0-7613-1905-4|pages=30–32 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=e2UxwnHvNMAC&amp;lpg=PT15&amp;dq=jesse%20ventura%20mongols&amp;pg=PT18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/May-12-Sun-2002/news/18724079.html |title=Outlaw Gangs: Northern Nevada eyes biker enmity |publisher=Reviewjournal.com |date=May 12, 2002 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Labar |first=Justin |url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/181959-complete-interview-transcript-with-jesse-ventura |title=Complete Interview Transcript With Jesse Ventura |publisher=Wrestlezone.com |date=May 14, 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1974, Ventura left the bike club to return to the [[Twin Cities]]. Shortly after that, the Mongols entered into open warfare with their biker rivals, the [[Hells Angels]].&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

Ventura attended [[North Hennepin Community College]] in [[Brooklyn Park, Minnesota]] in [[suburban Minneapolis]] during the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; At the same time, he began [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] and [[wrestling]]. He was a bodyguard for [[The Rolling Stones]] for a time, before he entered professional wrestling and adopted the wrestling name Jesse Ventura.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/on2/elections/ventura.html Jesse Ventura] PBS&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career ==

===Early career===
He created the stage name Jesse "The Body" Ventura to go with the persona of a bully-ish beach bodybuilder, picking the name "[[Ventura, California|Ventura]]" from a map as part of his "bleach blond from California" [[list of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]].&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; As a wrestler, Ventura performed as a [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] and often used the motto: "Win if you can, lose if you must, but always cheat!", even going so far as having himself a T-shirt made with the words printed on the front. Much of his flamboyant persona was adapted from [[Superstar Billy Graham]], a charismatic and popular performer during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;&lt;ref name=mol&gt;John Molinaro, ''The Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time'', (Winding Stair Press: 2002), page 199&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, as a broadcaster, Ventura made a running joke out of it claiming that Graham stole all of his ring attire ideas from him.

===Singles and tag team success===
In 1975, Ventura made his debut in the Central States territory, before moving to the Pacific Northwest, where he wrestled for promoter [[Don Owen (wrestling promoter)|Don Owen]] as Jesse "The Great" Ventura.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;&lt;ref name=mol/&gt; During his stay in [[Portland, Oregon]], he had notable feuds with [[Dutch Savage]] and [[Jimmy Snuka]] and won the Pacific Northwest Wrestling title twice (once from each wrestler) and the tag team title five times (twice each with [[Apache Bull Ramos|Bull Ramos]] and [[Buddy Rose|"Playboy" Buddy Rose]], and once with Jerry Oates). He later moved to his hometown promotion, the [[American Wrestling Association]] in Minnesota, and began teaming with [[Adrian Adonis]] as the "East-West Connection" in 1979. In his RF Video shoot in 2012, he revealed that shortly after he arrived in the AWA he was given the nickname "the Body" by Verne Gagne.&lt;ref name=WWEProfile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/jesseventura/|title=WWE profile}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mol/&gt; The duo won the promotion's [[AWA World Tag Team Championship|World Tag Team Championship]] on July 20, 1980, on a [[wikt:forfeit|forfeit]] when [[Verne Gagne]], one-half of the tag team champions along with [[Maurice Vachon|Mad Dog Vachon]], failed to show up for a title defense in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; The duo held the belts for nearly a year, losing to "The High Flyers" ([[Greg Gagne (wrestler)|Greg Gagne]] and [[Jim Brunzell]]).&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;

===Retirement and commentary===
Shortly after losing the belts, the duo moved on to the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] where they were managed by [[Freddie Blassie]].&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; Although the duo was unable to capture the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]], both Adonis and Ventura became singles title contenders, each earning several title shots at [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Bob Backlund]].&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;

Ventura continued to wrestle until September 1984 after 3 back to back losses to world champion Hulk Hogan, when blood clots in his lungs effectively ended his in-ring career. He claimed that the blood clots were a result of his exposure to [[Agent Orange]] during his time in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;&lt;ref name=slambio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/ventura_jesse.html|title=Jesse Ventura's bio|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2009-06-26|date=January 21, 2006|author=Milner, John M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ventura returned to the ring in 1985, forming a tag-team with [[Randy Savage]] and Savage's manager (and real-life wife) [[Miss Elizabeth]]. Often after their televised matches Ventura would taunt and challenge fellow commentator [[Bruno Sammartino]], but nothing ever came of this.

Ventura participated in a six-man tag team match in December 1985 when he, [[Roddy Piper]], and [[Bob Orton]] defeated [[Hillbilly Jim]], [[Uncle Elmer]], and [[Gene Petit|Cousin Luke]] in a match which was broadcast on ''Saturday Night's Main Event''. The tag match against the Hillbillies came about after Piper and Orton interrupted Elmer's wedding ceremony on the previous edition of the show; Ventura, who later claimed that he was under instruction from fellow commentator and WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]] to "bury them", insulted Elmer and his wife during commentary of what was a real wedding ceremony at the [[Meadowlands Arena]], by proclaiming when they kissed: "It looks like two [[Carp]] in the middle of the [[Mississippi River]] going after the same piece of corn." According to Ventura the wedding was real, for at that time the [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] would not allow the WWF to stage a fake wedding in the state of [[New Jersey]], so Stan Frazier (Uncle Elmer) and his fiance had agreed to have a real in-ring wedding.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;

After a failed comeback bid, Ventura hosted his own talk segment on the WWF's ''Superstars of Wrestling'' called "The Body Shop", in much the same heel style as "Piper's Pit", though the setting was a mock gym (when Ventura was unavailable, "The Body Shop" was often hosted by [[Don Muraco]]). He began to do [[color commentator#Sports entertainment|color commentary]] on television for ''[[List of former World Wrestling Entertainment programming#All-Star Wrestling (1974–1986)|All-Star Wrestling]]'', replacing [[Angelo Mosca]], and later ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars of Wrestling]]'', initially alongside Vince McMahon and the semi-retired Sammartino, and then just with McMahon after Sammartino's departure from the WWF in early 1988. Ventura most notably co-hosted ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' with McMahon, the first six [[WrestleMania]]s (five of which were alongside [[Gorilla Monsoon]]), and most of the WWF's pay-per-views at the time with Monsoon, with the lone exception for Ventura being the [[SummerSlam (1988)|first SummerSlam]], in which Ventura served as the guest referee during the main event.

Ventura's entertaining commentary style was an extension of his wrestling persona, i.e. a "[[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]", as he was partial to the villains, which was something new and different at the time. McMahon, who was always looking for ways of jazzing things up, came up with the idea of Ventura doing heel commentary at a time when most commentators, including McMahon himself, openly favored the [[face (professional wrestling)|fan favorites]].&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;

However, Ventura would still occasionally give credit where it was due, praising the athleticism of fan favorites such as [[Ricky Steamboat]] and Randy Savage, who was championed by Ventura for years, even when he was a face, a point Ventura regularly made on-air to McMahon and Monsoon. Occasionally he would even acknowledge mistakes made by the heels, including those made by his personal favorites such as Savage or wrestlers managed by heels [[Bobby Heenan]] and [[Jimmy Hart]].

One notable exception to this rule was the [[WrestleMania VI]] Ultimate Challenge title for title match between [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Champion]] [[Hulk Hogan]] and the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Champion]], The [[Warrior (wrestler)|Ultimate Warrior]]. Since they were both fan favorites, Ventura took a neutral position in his commentary, even praising Hogan's display of sportsmanship at the end of the match when he handed over the WWF Championship belt to the Warrior after he lost the title, stating that Hogan was going out like a true champion. During the match, however, which was also the last match at Wrestlemania he called, Ventura did voice his pleasure when both broke the rules, at one point claiming, "This is what I like. Let the two goody two-shoes throw the rule book out and get nasty." Ventura's praise of Hogan's action was unusual for him, because he regularly rooted against Hogan during his matches, usually telling fellow commentator Monsoon after Hogan had won a championship match at a Wrestlemania that he might "come out of retirement and take this dude out". Hogan and Ventura were at one point close friends.&lt;ref name="VBot1"&gt;Jesse Ventura, "I Ain't Got Time To Bleed pg. 108&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ventura abruptly ended the friendship after he discovered, during his lawsuit against McMahon, that Hogan was the one who had told McMahon about Ventura's attempt to form a labor union in 1984.&lt;ref name="VBot1" /&gt; Following a dispute with McMahon over the use of his image for promoting a [[Sega]] product, while McMahon had a contract with rival company [[Nintendo]] at the time, the promoter released Ventura from the company in August 1990.&lt;ref name="VBodt"&gt;Jake Tapper, "Body Slam: The Jesse Ventura Story," pg. 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;

Ventura later served as a radio announcer for a few [[National Football League]] teams, among them the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;

In February 1992 at [[SuperBrawl II]], Ventura joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] as a commentator. Ventura was ultimately released by WCW President [[Eric Bischoff]] for allegedly falling asleep during a ''WCW Worldwide'' TV taping at Disney MGM Studios in July 1994, although it has been speculated that the move may have had more to do with Hogan's arrival shortly before.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;

===Litigation===
In 1987, while negotiating his contract as a [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]] commentator, Ventura waived his rights to royalties on videotape sales when he was falsely told that only feature performers received such royalties. In November 1991, having discovered that other non-feature performers received [[royalties]], Ventura brought an action for fraud, misappropriation of publicity rights, and [[quantum meruit]] in [[Minnesota]] [[State court (United States)|state court]] against Titan Sports asking for the amount of $2 million in royalties based on a fair market value share.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrestlingforum.com/classic-wrestling/2001906-wrestling-observer-1994-a-2.html&lt;/ref&gt; Titan moved the case to [[United States district court|federal court]], and Ventura won a $801,333 jury [[verdict]] on the last claim. In addition the judge awarded him $8,625 in back pay for all non video WWF merchandising featuring Ventura. The judgment was affirmed on appeal, and the case,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-8th-circuit/1387808.html |title=Ventura v. Titan Sports, Inc |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; '' 65 F.3d 725 (8th Cir.1995), is an important result in the law of [[restitution]]. As a result, Ventura's commentary is removed on most releases from [[WWE Home Video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen |first=Eric |url=http://prowrestling.about.com/od/interviews/a/jesseventurainterview_3.htm |title=Jesse Ventura Interview |publisher=Prowrestling.about.com |date= |accessdate=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, [[Vince McMahon]] swore Ventura would never appear on any WWF program again.

===Return to the WWF/E===
In mid-1999, Ventura reappeared on WWF television during his term as Governor of Minnesota, acting as the special guest referee for main event of [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]] held in Minneapolis.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; Ventura would continue his relationship with the WWF by performing commentary for Vince McMahon's short-lived [[XFL]].&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; On the June 4, 2001 episode of Raw which aired live from Minnesota, Ventura appeared to overrule McMahon's authority and approve a WWF Championship match between then-champion [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and [[Chris Jericho]]. On the March 20, 2003 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]],'' Ventura appeared in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#vignette|taped interview]] to talk about the match between McMahon and [[Hulk Hogan]] at [[WrestleMania XIX]].&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; Less than a year later, he would be inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2004)|class of 2004]] on March 13, 2004 and the following night at [[WrestleMania XX]], he approached the ring to interview [[Donald Trump]], who had a front row seat at the event.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; Trump affirmed that Ventura would receive his moral and financial support were he to ever reenter the world of politics. Alluding to the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 election]], Ventura boldly announced that "In 2008, maybe we oughta put a wrestler in the [[White House]]". On the June 11, 2007 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]],'' Ventura appeared to give comments about McMahon.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; Ventura was guest host on the November 23, 2009 episode of ''Raw,'' during which he retained his [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] persona by siding with the number one contender [[Sheamus]] over WWE Champion [[John Cena]]. This happened while he confronted Cena about how it was unfair that Cena always got a title shot in the WWE, while Ventura never did during his WWE career. After that, Sheamus attacked Cena and put him through a table. Ventura then made the match a Table match at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs (2009)|TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs]]. During the show, for the first time in nearly 20 years, McMahon joined Ventura at ringside to provide match commentary together.

==Acting career==
Nearing the end of his wrestling career, Ventura began an acting career. He acted in the 1987 movie ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', whose cast included future California [[list of Governors of California|Governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and future [[Kentucky]] [[Governor of Kentucky|Gubernatorial]] candidate [[Sonny Landham]].&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; Ventura became close friends with Schwarzenegger during the production of ''Predator''. He appeared in two episodes of ''[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]'' filmed in Madrid, Spain, in 1991. He had a starring role in the 1990 sci-fi movie ''[[Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe]]''. He had supporting roles in ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'', ''[[Thunderground]]'', ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'', ''[[Repossessed]]'', ''[[Ricochet (film)|Ricochet]]'', ''[[The Master of Disguise]]'' (in which he steals the [[Liberty Bell]]), and ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]''—the first and last of these also starring Schwarzenegger. Ventura made a cameo appearance in ''[[Major League II]]'', as "White Lightning". He appeared as a self-help guru (voice only) in ''[[The Ringer (2005 film)|The Ringer]]'' trying to turn [[Johnny Knoxville]] into a more confident worker. Ventura had a cameo in ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode "[[Jose Chung's From Outer Space|Jose Chung's ''From Outer Space'']]" as a [[Men in Black (The X-Files)|Man in Black]] alongside fellow 'MiB' [[Alex Trebek]]. In 2008, Ventura was in the independent comedy ''[[Woodshop (movie)|Woodshop]]'', starring as a high school shop teacher named Mr. Madson. The film was released September 7, 2010.

Jesse Ventura was a bodyguard for the Rolling Stones in the late 1970s and '80s.  The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger said of Jesse Ventura, "He's done us proud, hasn't he? He's been fantastic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19990216&amp;id=l0QfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yM8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5197,3671972&amp;hl=en|title=Herald-Journal - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 80s, Ventura appeared in a series of [[Miller Lite]] commercials with [[Bob Uecker]].

In 1989, Ventura co-hosted the four episodes of the [[DiC Entertainment]] children's program ''[[Record Breakers: World of Speed#TV series|Record Breakers]]'' along with [[Gary Apple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dicentertainment.com/dic_shows.html#MShows |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040401135740/http://www.dicentertainment.com/dic_shows.html#MShows |archivedate=April 1, 2004 |title=DiC Shows |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=April 1, 2004 |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HFBTUhnc9DwC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;lpg=PA310&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The WrestleCrap Book of Lists!] By R.

Ventura also co-hosted the short-lived syndicated game show ''[[The Grudge Match]]'' alongside sportscaster [[Steve Albert]].

Ventura played a minor role in a 1996 episode of ''[[The X-Files]]'' alongside [[Alex Trebek]].

Between 1995 and his run for governor in 1998, Ventura had [[talk radio|radio call-in shows]] on ([[KFAN (AM)|KFAN]] 1130) and ([[KSTP (AM)|KSTP]] 1500) in [[Minneapolis – Saint Paul]]. He also had a brief role on the television soap opera ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' in 1999.

Ventura has been criticized by the press for privately profiting from his heightened popularity. He was hired as a television analyst for the failed [[XFL]] [[American football|football]] enterprise, [[SummerSlam (1999)|served as a referee at a World Wrestling Federation match]], and published several books during his tenure as governor. On his weekly radio show, he often criticized the media for focusing on these deals rather than on his policy proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200201/28_khoom_jessereview/ |title=MPR: Ventura – the year in review |publisher=News.minnesota.publicradio.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009–2012, [[TruTV]] aired three seasons of the television series ''[[Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura]]''.

Ventura had a guest spot on an episode of the 2012 rebooted ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' animated series on [[Nickelodeon]].

Following his departure from the WWF, Ventura took advice from a former high school teacher and ran for mayor of [[Brooklyn Park, Minnesota]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="VBot2"&gt;Jake Tapper, "Body Slam: The Jesse Ventura Story," pg. 105–108&lt;/ref&gt; Ventura defeated the city's 25-year incumbent mayor and served from 1991 to 1995.&lt;ref name="VElec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morris.umn.edu/register/article.php?volume=11&amp;issue=5&amp;section=feature&amp;index=2 |title=Mayor of Brooklyn Park, Jesse Ventura: Reform endorsed candidate |publisher=Morris.umn.edu |author=Carly Skorczewski |date=October 29, 1998 |volume=11 |issue=5 |accessdate=2008-10-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107061557/http://www.morris.umn.edu/register/article.php?volume=11&amp;issue=5&amp;section=feature&amp;index=2|archivedate=January 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ventura ran for Governor of Minnesota in 1998 as the nominee for the Reform Party of Minnesota (he later joined the [[Independence Party of Minnesota]] when the Reform Party broke from its association with the [[Reform Party of the United States of America]]). His campaign consisted of a combination of aggressive [[grassroots]] events organized in part by his campaign manager [[Doug Friedline]] and original television spots, designed by quirky adman [[Bill Hillsman]], using the phrase "Don't vote for politics as usual." He spent considerably less than his opponents (about $300,000) and was a pioneer in his using the Internet as a medium of reaching out to voters in a political campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howeypolitics.com/2009/06/18/brian-howey-time-to-take-over-the-indiana-libertarian-party/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818140106/http://www.howeypolitics.com/2009/06/18/brian-howey-time-to-take-over-the-indiana-libertarian-party/|archivedate=August 18, 2009|title=Time to Take Over the Indiana Libertarian Party|author=Howey, Brian|accessdate=2009-06-26|date=June 18, 2009}} Retrieved from Internet Archive January 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

He won the election in November 1998, narrowly (and unexpectedly) defeating the major-party candidates, [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] mayor [[Norm Coleman]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) and Minnesota [[State Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Skip Humphrey|Hubert H. "Skip" Humphrey III]] ([[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|Democratic-Farmer-Labor]]). During his victory speech, Ventura famously declared, "We shocked the world!"&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Marc. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/keyraces98/stories/ventura110498.htm Jesse 'The Body' Wins Minn. Gubernatorial Race]." ''Washington Post''. 1998-11-04. Retrieved 2016-03-05.&lt;/ref&gt; After his election, bumper stickers and T-shirts bearing the slogan "My governor can beat up your governor" appeared in Minnesota. The nickname "Jesse 'The Mind{{' "}} (from a last-minute Hillsman ad featuring Ventura posing as Rodin's ''Thinker'') began to resurface sarcastically in reference to his frequently controversial remarks. Ventura's old stage name "Jesse 'The Body{{' "}} (sometimes adapted to "Jesse 'The Governing Body{{' "}}) also continued to appear with some regularity.

After a trade mission to China in 2002, Ventura announced that he would not run for a second term, stating that he no longer felt dedicated enough to his job to run again as well as what he viewed were constant attacks on his family by the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jesse Ventura announces he will not seek second term in November|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020618&amp;slug=webventura18|publisher=seattletimes.nwsource.com|accessdate=June 22, 2012|date=June 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ventura accused the media of hounding him and his family for personal behavior and belief while neglecting coverage of important policy issues. He later told a reporter for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' that he would have run for a second term if he had been single, citing the media's effect on his family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/02/25/the_body_politic/ |title=The Body politic – The Boston Globe |publisher=Boston.com |author=Joseph P.

Governor Ventura sparked media criticism when, nearing the end of his term, he suggested that he might resign from office early to allow his lieutenant governor, [[Mae Schunk]], an opportunity to serve as governor. He further stated that he wanted her to be the state's first female governor and have her portrait painted and hung in the Capitol along with the other governors. Ventura quickly retreated from the comments, saying he was just floating an idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politicalwire.com/archives/2002/10/21/ventura_may_leave_office_early.html |title=Ventura May Leave Office Early – Political Wire |publisher=Politicalwire.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612030529/http://politicalwire.com/archives/2002/10/21/ventura_may_leave_office_early.html |archivedate=June 12, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Leaders debate|political debates]], Ventura often admitted that he had not formed an opinion on certain policy questions. Ventura frequently described himself as "[[Fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] and [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ain't Got Time to Bleed|author=Ventura, Jesse|pages=13–14|isbn=0-451-20086-1|publisher=Signet|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He selected teacher [[Mae Schunk]] as his running mate.

Lacking a party base in the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]] and [[Minnesota Senate|Senate]], Ventura's policy ambitions had little chance of being introduced as bills. Initially, the residents of Minnesota feared Ventura's vetoes would be overturned. He vetoed 45 bills in his first year, only three of which were overridden. The reputation for having his vetoes overridden comes from his fourth and final year, where six of his nine vetoes were overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.mn.us/lrl/vetoes/vetodetails.aspx?years=all|title=Veto Details, Minnesota Legislature|publisher=Minnesota Legislative Reference Library |date= |accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Ventura was still successful in several initiatives. One of the most notable was the rebate on [[sales tax]]. In each year of his administration, Minnesotans received a tax-free check in the late summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.org/portal/site/nga/menuitem.29fab9fb4add37305ddcbeeb501010a0/?vgnextoid=d676ae3effb81010VgnVCM1000001a01010aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=e449a0ca9e3f1010VgnVCM1000001a01010aRCRD |title=National Governors Association |publisher=nga.org |date=November 1, 2008 |accessdate=2010-09-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629032126/http://www.nga.org/portal/site/nga/menuitem.29fab9fb4add37305ddcbeeb501010a0/?vgnextoid=d676ae3effb81010VgnVCM1000001a01010aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=e449a0ca9e3f1010VgnVCM1000001a01010aRCRD|archivedate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state was running a [[budget]] surplus at the time, and Ventura believed that the money should be returned to the public.

Later, he came to support a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] (one-house) legislature, [[property tax]] reform, [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]], and abortion rights. While funding [[public school (government funded)|public school]] education generously, he opposed the teachers' union, and did not have a high regard for the public funding of higher education institutions. Additionally, Ventura supported the use of medicinal [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/4141824/jesse-ventura-legalize-marijuana/#sp=show-clips Jesse Ventura: Legalize Marijuana] Fox Business News. Retrieved January 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; advocated a higher role for [[third party (United States)|third parties]] in national politics, and favored the concept of [[instant-runoff voting]]. He also opposed the death penalty.

In an interview on ''The Howard Stern Show'', he reaffirmed his support of gay rights, including in marriage and military service, humorously stating he would have gladly served alongside homosexuals when he was in the Navy as they would have provided less competition for women.&lt;ref name="stern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1242705600#14047 |title=The body on the hulk – The Howard Stern Show |publisher=Howardstern.com |date=May 19, 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131155709/http://howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1242705600|archivedate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Later, on the subject of a [[recognition of same-sex unions in Minnesota#Constitutional amendments|2012 referendum]] on amending the [[Minnesota Constitution|Minnesota constitution]] to limit marriage to male-female couples, Ventura elaborated "I certainly hope that people don't amend our constitution to stop gay marriage because, number one, the constitution is there to protect people – not oppress them", and went on to relate a story from his pro wrestling days of a friend who was denied hospital visitation to his same-sex partner.&lt;ref name="MarriageAmendment"&gt;{{cite web |title=Political Notebook: Ventura offers to campaign against marriage amendment |url=http://www.postbulletin.com/news/stories/display.php?id=1500082 |last=Carlson |first=Heather J. |work=[[Post-Bulletin]] |publisher= |date=June 18, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Ventura was elected on a Reform party ticket, but he never received support from [[Ross Perot]]'s Texas faction. When the Reform party was taken over by [[Pat Buchanan]] supporters before the [[United States presidential election, 2000|presidential elections of 2000]], Ventura left the party in February 2000, referring to it as "hopelessly dysfunctional". However, he maintained close ties to the [[Independence Party of Minnesota]], which also broke from the Reform party around the same time.

During the first part of his administration, Ventura strongly advocated for land-use reform and substantial [[public transport|mass transit]] improvements, such as [[light rail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Don't start the revolution without me!|author=Ventura, Jesse|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|year=2008|isbn=1-60239-273-0|pages=143–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made the light rail project a priority, obtaining additional funding from the Minnesota state legislature to keep the project moving. The [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|METRO Blue Line]] was completed in 2004.

During another trade mission to [[Cuba]] in the summer of 2002, he denounced the [[United States embargo against Cuba]], stating that the embargo affected the Cuban public more than it did its government.&lt;ref name=cuba&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200209/25_khoom_cuba1/ |title=MPR: Ventura begins final foreign journey as governor |publisher=News.minnesota.publicradio.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Independent Nation'', political analyst [[John Avlon]] describes Ventura as a [[radical center (politics)|radical centrist]] thinker and activist.&lt;ref&gt;Avlon, John (2004). ''Independent Nation: How the Vital Center Is Changing American Politics''. Harmony Books / Random House, pp. 177–93 ("Radical Centrists"). {{ISBN|978-1-4000-5023-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Views on political parties====
Ventura, who ran on a Reform Party ticket and advocated for a greater role for third parties in American politics, is highly critical of both Democrats and Republicans. Ventura described both parties as "monsters that are out of control" who are concerned only with "their own agendas and their pork."&lt;ref name=Principles&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesse Ventura on Principles &amp; Values|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Jesse_Ventura_Principles_+_Values.htm|publisher=ontheissues.org|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been a supporter of [[third party (United States)|third parties]] as governor and voted for [[Ralph Nader]] in 2000 and 2008, although he did vote for [[John Kerry]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]. He then expressed a potential 2020 presidential candidacy with the [[Green Party of the United States]].

====Wellstone memorial====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Walter Mondale]] --&gt;
Ventura greatly disapproved of some of the actions that took place at the 2002 memorial for [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Paul Wellstone]], his family, and others who died in a plane crash on October 25, 2002. Ventura said, "I feel used. I feel violated and duped over the fact that the memorial ceremony turned into a [[demonstration (people)|political rally]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,67075,00.html |title=Ventura May Tap Independent to Wellstone's Seat; Mondale Officially in for Dems |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=October 31, 2002 |accessdate=2008-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205130655/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C67075%2C00.html |archivedate=February 5, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/001/830clrob.asp |title=Honor &amp; Civility, RIP |publisher=Weeklystandard.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left halfway through the controversial speech made by Wellstone's best friend, [[Wellstoning|Rick Kahn]]. Ventura had initially planned to appoint a Democrat to Wellstone's seat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/showdown-in-minnesota-senate-race/|title=Showdown In Minnesota Senate Race |publisher=CBS Sports |date=November 5, 2002 |accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he instead appointed [[Dean Barkley]] to represent [[Minnesota]] in the Senate until Wellstone's term expired in January 2003. Barkley was succeeded by Norm Coleman, who won the [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2002|seat]] against [[Walter Mondale]], who became the Democratic candidate replacement a few days before the election.

====Political criticisms====
After the legislature refused to increase spending for security, Ventura attracted criticism when he decided not to live in the governor's mansion during his tenure, choosing instead to shut it down and stay at his home in [[Maple Grove, Minnesota|Maple Grove]]. Critics pointed to the loss of jobs for several working-class people at the mansion and the extra cost of reopening the mansion later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E6D71431F932A35756C0A9649C8B63 |title=National Briefing &amp;#124; Midwest: Minnesota: Governor Shuts Mansion – New York Times |publisher=Query.nytimes.com |date= May 1, 2002 |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, a group of disgruntled citizens petitioned to recall Governor Ventura, alleging, among other things, that "the use of state security personnel to protect the governor on a book promotion tour constituted illegal use of state property for personal gain." The petition was denied.&lt;ref&gt;In Re Proposed Petition to Recall Governor Jesse Ventura http://wrestlingperspective.com/legal/ventura.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposed petition was dismissed by order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Minnesota.  Under Minnesota law, a proposed petition for recall is required to be reviewed by the Chief Justice for legal sufficiency, and, upon such review, the Chief Justice determined that it did not allege the commission of any act that violated Minnesota law.  Ventura sought attorney’s fees as a sanction for the filing of a frivolous petition for recall, but that request was denied, on the ground that there was no statutory authority for such an award.&lt;ref&gt;In re Proposed Petition to Recall Governor Ventura, 600 N.W.2d 714 (Minn. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Ventura held a press conference in relation to a lawsuit he had filed against the [[Transportation Security Administration]]. During that press conference, Ventura stated that he would "never stand for a national anthem again, I will turn my back and raise a fist the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|same way Tommy Smith and John Carlos did in the ’68 Olympics]], Jesse Ventura will do that today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2011/11/jesse_ventura_i/ |title=Jesse Ventura: ‘I will never stand for the national anthem again.’ He went on to state he has lost his patriotism and would now refer to the United States of America as the "Fascist States of America".|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio News |date=November 4, 2011 |accessdate=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure as governor, Ventura drew frequent fire from the press in the Twin Cities. He referred to reporters as "media jackals," a term that even appeared on the press passes required to enter the governor's press area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=14279 |title=Provocative Press Pass Miffs Minnesota Media |publisher=Stateline.org |author=Lynda McConnell, Special to Stateline.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Ventura's election as governor, author and [[list of humorists|humorist]] [[Garrison Keillor]] wrote a [[satire|satirical]] book about the event, spoofing Ventura as "Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente," a self-aggrandizing former "Navy W.A.L.R.U.S. (Water Air Land Rising Up Suddenly)" turned professional wrestler turned politician. Initially, Ventura responded angrily to the satire, but later, in a conciliatory vein, said that Keillor "makes Minnesota proud".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.current.org/people/peop908g.html |title=Current.org &amp;#124; Keillor v.

Ventura responded, "Minneapolis. Those streets in St. Paul must have been designed by drunken Irishmen". He later apologized for the remark, adding that it was not intended to be taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E3DD173CF935A15751C0A96F958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/V/Ventura,%20Jesse |title=Gov.

====Consideration of bids for other political offices====
[[File:Jesse Ventura in Los Angeles, July 2007 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Ventura in 2007]]
While Ventura has not held public office since the end of his term as governor in 2003, he has remained politically active and has occasionally hinted at intentions of possibly running again for political office. In an interview on [[CNN]]'s ''[[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer|The Situation Room]]'' on April 7, 2008, Ventura said that he was considering entering the [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2008|race for]] the [[United States Senate]] seat then held by Norm Coleman, his Republican opponent in the 1998 Gubernatorial race. A poll commissioned by [[Minneapolis – Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] station [[KMSP-TV|Fox 9]] put him at 24 percent, behind Democratic candidate [[Al Franken]] at 32 percent and [[Norm Coleman]] at 39 percent in a hypothetical three-way race. However, Ventura announced on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' on July 14, 2008, that he would not run; Ventura's decision not to join the race was partly rooted from a fear of a potential lack of privacy for his family, a concern that contributed to his refusal to seek a second term as governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Falcone |first=Michael |title=Ventura Decides Against Senate Run |work=The Caucus|publisher=New York Times |date=July 14, 2008 |url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/14/ventura-decides-against-senate-run/ |accessdate=2008-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Franken ended up winning the election.

In his 1999 autobiography, ''I Ain't Got Time to Bleed'', Ventura suggested he did not plan on running for President of the United States but did not rule out such an idea.&lt;ref name=Principles/&gt; In 2003, he again expressed interest in running for President while accepting an award from the International Wrestling Institute and Museum in Newton, Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://classicwrestlingarticles.wordpress.com/2018/09/07/ventura-interested-in-running-for-president/|title=Ventura Interested In Running For President|date=2018-09-07|work=Classic Wrestling Articles|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke at Republican presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]]'s "[[Ron Paul's Rally for the Republic|Rally for the Republic]]", organized by the [[Campaign for Liberty]], on September 2, 2008. At the event, Ventura implied a possible future run at the U.S. Presidency. At the end of his speech, Ventura announced before a live audience that if he saw that the public was willing to see a change in the direction of the country, then "in [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]] we'll give them a race they'll never forget!" In 2011, Ventura expressed interest in running with Ron Paul for the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential elections]] if the latter decided to run as an [[independent politician|independent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barr|first=Andy|title=Jesse Ventura wants to be Ron Paul's 2012 running mate|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0411/52516.html|publisher=Politico|accessdate=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 4, 2011, Ventura said at a press conference about the dismissal of his court case against the [[Transportation Security Administration]] for what he claims are illegal searches of air travelers, that he was "thinking about" running for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.twincities.com/news/ci_19265340?source=rss| author=Emily Gurnon| title=Angry Jesse Ventura thinking about presidential run| publisher=TwinCities.com| date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2011/11/04/judge-dismisses-venturas-lawsuit-over-tsa-pat-downs/| title=Ventura, Miffed Over Lawsuit, Says He’s Off To Mexico|publisher=WCCO/AP|date=November 4, 2011|accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had been reports that officials from the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] have tried to persuade Ventura to run for the presidency on a Libertarian ticket although the party chairman [[Mark Hinkle]] said, "Jesse is more interested in 2016 than he is in 2012. But I think he's serious. If Ron Paul ran as a Libertarian, I think he definitely would be interested in running as a vice presidential candidate. He's thinking, ‘If I run as the vice presidential candidate under Ron Paul in 2012, I could run as a presidential candidate in 2016."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Reid J.|title=Gary Johnson eyes Libertarians, who eye Ventura|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1111/69398.html|publisher=politico.com|accessdate=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Gewirtz of ZDNet wrote in a November 2011 article that he thinks Ventura would have a chance at winning, if he declared his intention to run at that point and ran a serious campaign, but that it would be a long shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/government/is-there-any-possible-way-jesse-ventura-could-win-the-presidency/10980?pg=2| author=David Gewirtz| title=Is there any possible way Jesse Ventura could win the Presidency?| publisher=ZDNet| date=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential 2016 presidential campaign ===
In late 2015, Ventura publicly flirted with the idea of running for president in 2016 as a Libertarian but in May 2016, Ventura decided not to seek the presidency, allowing his self determined deadline of May 1 to pass. No explanation was given, but he expressed support for  Libertarian [[Gary Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ventura|first1=Jesse|title=Why I'm voting for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson for president|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/13/jesse-ventura-why-im-voting-for-libertarian-candidate-gary-johnson-for-president-commentary.html|website=CNBC|accessdate=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually voted for [[Jill Stein]].

===Potential 2020 presidential campaign===
In Spring of 2018, Ventura expressed interest in running for president once again, but said he would only do so under the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dore|first1=Jimmy|title=How Jesse Ventura Would Run For President In 2020 -pt. 3|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DU0QP4jQ3s&amp;feature=youtu.be|date=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 28, 2018, Ventura again said that he was considering running for president in 2020 saying "The [Green Party] has shown some interest. I haven't made a decision yet because it's a long time off. If I do do it, Trump will not have a chance. For one, Trump knows wrestling. He participated in two Wrestlemanias. He knows he can never out-talk a wrestler, and he knows I'm the greatest talker wrestling's ever had."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JESSE VENTURA

==Post-gubernatorial life==
Ventura was succeeded in his office on January 6, 2003, by Republican [[Tim Pawlenty]]. He began a weekly cable television show in October 2003, on [[MSNBC]] called Jesse Ventura's America; the show was short-lived and ended only a couple of months after it began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Scott|title=Jesse Ventura searches for coverups|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/29/entertainment/la-ca-conversation29-2009nov29|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 17, 2014|date=November 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Harvard University|Harvard]] graduate student and fellow Navy veteran Christopher Mora promoted the idea that the academic establishment had failed to reach out to citizens experienced in public service, but who did not fit the traditional idea of a politician. He successfully lobbied for the selection of Ventura, who started teaching a study group at Harvard University for the Spring 2004 semester as a visiting [[fellow]] at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Kennedy School of Government]]'s Institute of Politics (IOP). His 90-minute study group focused on third party politics, campaign finance, the war on drugs, and other relevant political issues. Ventura scheduled multiple famous friends to appear for his seminars including [[Dean Barkley]] and [[Richard Marcinko]].

On October 22, 2004, with Ventura by his side, former Governor of [[Maine]] [[Angus King]] endorsed [[John Kerry]] for president at the Minnesota state capitol building. Ventura did not speak at the press conference. When prodded for a statement, King responded, "He plans to vote for John Kerry, but he doesn't want to make a statement and subject himself to the tender mercies of the Minnesota press".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/10/28_mccalluml_venturakerry/ |title=MPR: Speechless no more, Ventura stumps for Kerry at colleges |publisher=News.minnesota.publicradio.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States Senate elections, 2012|2012 Senate elections]], Ventura endorsed King in his campaign for the open Senate seat in Maine, in which King won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gavin|first=Patrick|title=Jesse Ventura goes gangsta in political tome|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0612/77395.html|publisher=Politico|accessdate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2004, an advertisement began airing in California featuring Ventura. In it, Ventura voiced his opposition to then-Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s policies regarding Native American [[casino]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p4Rd1yXBGWIC&amp;pg=PA137|isbn=1-60239-716-3|page=137|title=Don't Start the Revolution Without Me!|author=Jesse Ventura|date=May 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ventura served as an advisory board member for a group called [[Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America|Operation Truth]], a non-profit organization set up "to give voice to troops who served in Iraq." "The current use of the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] is wrong....These are men who did not sign up to go occupy foreign nations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armytimes.com/story.php?f=1-ARMYPAPER-323322.php |title=Army News, benefits, careers, entertainment, photos, promotions – Army Times HOME |publisher=Armytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, Ventura became the spokesperson for [[BetUS]], an online [[sportsbook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betus.com/site-siteJesseVideo.asp |title=BetUs Events |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=October 15, 2007 |accessdate=2010-06-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060720160431/http://www.betus.com/site-siteJesseVideo.asp|archivedate=July 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Ventura repeatedly discussed leaving the United States. In September 2005, Ventura announced on ''[[The Mike Malloy Show]]'' that he was leaving the U.S. and planned to "have an adventure". In late October 2005, he went on ''[[The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch|The Big Idea with]] [[Donny Deutsch]]'' and reiterated that he was leaving the United States and moving to [[Mexico]] due to, among other things, censorship.

In September 2006, Ventura endorsed and campaigned with independent Texas gubernatorial candidate [[Kinky Friedman]], and Independence Party of Minnesota's gubernatorial candidate [[Peter Hutchinson]] and Team Minnesota.

On December 29, 2011, Ventura announced his support for Ron Paul on the ''[[Alex Jones Show]]'' for the 2012 presidential election as "the only anti-war candidate." Like Paul, Ventura is known for supporting a more [[non-interventionist]] foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;https://ivn.us/2010/03/10/jesse-ventura-calls-out-democrats-republicans-and-tea-party/&lt;/ref&gt; However, after [[Mitt Romney]] became the [[presumptive nominee]] for the Republican party presidential candidate in May 2012, Ventura gave his support to [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] candidate [[Gary Johnson]] on June 12, 2012, whom Ventura argued was the choice for voters who "really want to rebel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martel|first=Frances|title=Jesse Ventura Tells CNN Morning Crew Why Politicians Should Wear NASCAR Outfits|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/jesse-ventura-tells-cnn-morning-crew-why-politicians-should-wear-nascar-outfits/|publisher=mediaite.com|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Ventura and his wife appeared in an advertisement calling for voters to reject a referendum to be held in Minnesota during the [[United States elections, 2012|November elections]] that would [[Minnesota Amendment 1|ban same-sex marriages in the state]]. The referendum was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesse Ventura campaigns against anti-gay marriage amendment|url=http://www.wisconsingazette.com/breaking-news/jesse-ventura-campaigns-against-anti-gay-marriage-amendment.html|publisher=wisconsingazette.com|accessdate=January 12, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130217012126/http://www.wisconsingazette.com/breaking-news/jesse-ventura-campaigns-against-anti-gay-marriage-amendment.html|archivedate=February 17, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minnesota Amendment 1 Same-Sex Marriage Ballot Measure Fails|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/07/minnesota-amendment-1-results-2012_n_2050310.html|accessdate=January 12, 2013 |work=Huffington Post|first=Noah|last=Michelson|date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, on his [[RT America]] program "[https://www.rt.com/shows/the-world-according-to-jesse/ The World According To Jesse]" he expressed a potential presidential run with the [[Green Party of the United States]] in 2020.

===Bush Administration and torture===
In a May 11, 2009, interview with [[Larry King]], Ventura twice stated that [[George W. Bush]] was the worst president of his lifetime, adding "[[Barack Obama|President Obama]] inherited something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. You know? Two wars, an economy that's borderline depression."&lt;ref name="CNNKing"/&gt; On the issue of [[waterboarding]], Ventura added:

{{quote|I will criticize President Obama on this level: it's a good thing I'm not president because I would prosecute every person that was involved in that torture. I would prosecute the people that did it. I would prosecute the people that ordered it. Because torture is against the law.

===Questions regarding 9/11===
In a brief interview with [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]] in September 2006, Ventura began expressing doubts regarding the events behind the [[September 11 attacks]]. Ventura expressed concern over [[NORAD]]'s response to the four commercial airliners that were hijacked and compared it to the [[1999 South Dakota Learjet crash|response to the plane crash]] that killed professional golfer [[Payne Stewart]] in 1999, in which fighter jets were scrambled to intercept Stewart's jet.

In April and May 2008, Jesse Ventura, in several radio interviews for his new book, ''Don't Start the Revolution Without Me'', reiterated his concerns about what he described as some of the unanswered questions about 9/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1211342400#11961|title=Jesse The Body Sounds Off|publisher=howardstern.com|date=May 21, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131153711/http://howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1211342400|archivedate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His remarks about the possibility that the [[World Trade Center controlled demolition conspiracy theories|World Trade Center was demolished with explosives]] were also repeated in newspaper and television stories following some of the interviews.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.kxnet.com/custom404.asp?404;http://www.kxnet.com/News/225221.asp Ventura says he regrets initial acceptance of 9/11 explanations], Associated Press, April 3, 2008  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813100813/http://www.kxnet.com/custom404.asp?404%3Bhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.kxnet.com%2FNews%2F225221.asp |date=August 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18, 2009, when asked by [[Sean Hannity]] of Fox News, how George W. Bush could have avoided the attacks of September 11, 2001, Ventura answered, "And there it is again, you pay attention to [[Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US|memos on August 6th]] that tell you exactly what [[Osama bin Laden|bin Laden]]'s gonna do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/19/jesse-ventura-gets-in-the_n_205146.html |title=Jesse Ventura, Hannity Go Head-To-Head |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= May 19, 2009|accessdate=2010-06-13 |first=Jason |last=Linkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, 2011, when [[Piers Morgan]] from CNN asked Ventura what his official view on the events of 9/11 was, Ventura said, "My theory of 9/11 is that we certainly – at the best [[September 11 attacks advance-knowledge conspiracy theories|we knew]] it was going to happen. They allowed it to happen to further their agenda in the Middle East and go to [[War on Terror|these wars]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT Interview With Jesse Ventura|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1104/09/pmt.01.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books written by Ventura===
 {{Main|American Conspiracies}}
During his time as governor, Ventura wrote a number of politically themed books. He continued to write several other books after leaving office. In April 2008, a book authored by Ventura, titled ''Don't Start the Revolution Without Me'', was released. In it, Ventura describes a hypothetical campaign in which he is a candidate for President of the United States in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]], running as an [[independent politician|independent]]. In an interview with the [[Associated Press]] at the time of the book's release, however, Ventura denied any plans for a presidential bid, stating that the scenario is only imaginary and not indicative of a "secret plan to run".&lt;ref&gt;Freed, Joshua.[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-03-31-415832547_x.htm "Ventura:No Plans to Run Again, but..."], Associated Press. Retrieved April 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On [[MinnPost.com]], Ventura's agent, Steve Schwartz, described the book thus: "[Ventura is revealing] why he left politics and discussing the disastrous war in Iraq, why he sees our two-party system as corrupt, and what [[Fidel Castro]] told him about who was really behind the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minnpost.com/joekimball/2007/11/14/96/jesses_back_new_ventura_book_revolution_will_cover_political_waterfront|title=Jesse's back! New Ventura book 'Revolution' will cover political waterfront|work=MinnPost|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''American Conspiracies'' is a book Ventura wrote with Dick Russell, published by [[Skyhorse Publishing]] in 2010 which discusses [[conspiracy theories]] related to several notable events in United States history.

''63 Documents the Government Doesn't Want You to Read'' was written by Ventura with Dick Russell and published in 2011. The book describes documents that Ventura claims the government does not want the public to be informed of, although he stated the documents were not stolen and were only in the [[public domain]].

Ventura also wrote ''DemoCRIPS and ReBLOODlicans: No More Gangs in Government'', which was released in 2012. The book expresses Ventura's opposition to the [[two-party system]] and calls for political parties to be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Jennifer|title=Inside the Beltway: Bipartisan gangland|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/may/14/inside-the-beltway-bipartisan-gangland/|publisher=washingtontimes.com|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ventura authored the 2013 book ''They Killed Our President: 63 Reasons to Believe There Was a Conspiracy to Assassinate JFK'', the release of which coincided with the 50th anniversary of [[John F. Kennedy Assassination|President John F. Kennedy's assassination]].

In 2016 ''Jesse Ventura's Marijuana Manifesto'' was published, making the case for the legalization of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and detailing the various special interests that benefit from keeping cannabis illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ventura |first1=Jesse |title=Jesse Ventura's Marijuana Manifesto |date=September 6, 2016 |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |isbn=978-1510714243 |pages=316 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jesse-Venturas-Marijuana-Manifesto-Ventura/dp/1510714243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuit against the TSA===
In January 2011, Ventura filed a lawsuit against the [[Transportation Security Administration]], seeking a [[Declaratory judgment|declaration]] that the agency's new [[Transportation Security Administration#November 2010 enhanced screening procedures|controversial pat-down policy]] violated citizens' [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights and an [[injunction]] to bar the TSA from subjecting him to the pat-down procedures. Ventura received a titanium hip replacement in 2008 that sets off metal detectors at airport security checkpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hunter|first=Marnie|title=Jesse Ventura slams TSA with lawsuit|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/TRAVEL/01/25/jesse.ventura.tsa.lawsuit/index.html|date=September 27, 2011|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. district court]] dismissed the suit for lack of [[jurisdiction]] in November 2011, ruling that "challenges to TSA orders, policies and procedures" must be brought only in the [[U.S. courts of appeals]].&lt;ref name=courthouse&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koeninger|first1=Kevin|title=Jesse Ventura Can't Fight Airport Screening Rules|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2011/11/08/41290.htm|publisher=[[Courthouse News Service]]|date=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the court's ruling, Ventura held a press conference in which he disparaged the federal judges as "cowards"; said he no longer felt patriotic and would henceforth refer to the U.S. as "Fascist States of America"; said that he would never take [[commercial flight]]s again; said that he would seek [[dual citizenship]] in Mexico; and said that would "never stand for a national anthem again" and would instead [[Raised fist|raise a fist]].&lt;ref name=mpr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2011/11/jesse_ventura_i/|title=Jesse Ventura: ‘I will never stand for the national anthem again.'|author=Tom Scheck|date=November 4, 2011|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''We The People''===
On July 31, 2014, Ventura launched a weekly podcast distributed by [[Adam Carolla]]'s "Carolla Digital" called ''We The People''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkers.com/tag/adam-carolla/|title=Adam Carolla  : TALKERS.COM|publisher=|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/we-people-jesse-ventura/id904044124?mt=2|title=We The People with Jesse Ventura|work=iTunes|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegarynullshow.podbean.com/e/jesse-ventura-112514/|title=The Gary Null Show|publisher=|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guests have included [[Larry King]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timessquaregossip.com/2015/01/larry-king-talks-marijuana-with-jesse.html|title=Times Square Gossip|author=James Edstrom|publisher=|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roddy Piper]], [[Donald Trump]], and leaders of the [[9/11 Truth movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://911debunkers.blogspot.com/2014/09/coast-to-coast-am-september-4-2014-911.html|title=Debunking the Debunkers: Coast To Coast AM - September 4, 2014 9/11 Truth &amp; Prophecy|publisher=|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The podcast ran until March 4, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rare.us/story/jesse-ventura-msm-in-lockstep-with-the-government/|title=Jesse Ventura: "MSM in lockstep with the government"|work=Rare|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ora.tv/offthegrid/article/2014/7/30/we-the-people-with-jesse-ventura|title=We the People with Jesse Ventura|work=Ora TV|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 presidential election===

In the 2016 election, Ventura endorsed former [[New Mexico]] Governor [[Gary Johnson]], the nominee of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], stating "Johnson is a very viable alternative... This is the year for a third party candidate to rise, if there ever was one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ventura|first1=Jesse|title=Jesse Ventura: Why voters should listen to Gov.

==Controversies==

===Navy SEAL background controversy===
Bill Salisbury, an attorney in San Diego and a former Navy SEAL officer, has accused Ventura of "pretending" to be a [[SEAL]]. He wrote that Ventura would be blurring an important distinction by claiming to be a SEAL when he was actually a frogman with the [[Underwater Demolition Team|UDT]]. Compared to SEAL teams, UDTs saw less combat and took fewer casualties.&lt;ref name="news.minnesota.publicradio.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/199912/14_kastem_seals/ |title=MPR: Battling Seals |publisher=News.minnesota.publicradio.org |date=December 14, 1999 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EYkxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nKMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4203,170203 |title=Ventura brushes off criticism of SEAL training |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salisbury described Ventura's Navy training thus:&lt;blockquote&gt;[Ventura] took a screening test at boot camp to qualify for...Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training...Those who completed BUD/S, when [Ventura] was in training, were sent to either a SEAL or an underwater demolition team. Graduation did not, however, authorize the trainee to call himself a SEAL or a UDT frogman. He had to first successfully complete a six-month probationary period in the Teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/1999/dec/02/jesse-great-pretender-ventura/ |title=Jesse "The Great Pretender" Ventura |publisher=San Diego Reader |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ventura underwent BUD/S training and was assigned to a UDT team. Ventura received the NEC 5321/22 UDT designation given after six month probationary period completed with Underwater Demolition Team 12. He was never granted the Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) 5326 Combatant Swimmer (SEAL) designation which required a six month probationary period with SEAL TEAM ONE or TWO. In 1983, eight years after Ventura left the Navy, the UDTs were disbanded and those operators were retrained and re-tasked as SEALs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Responding to the controversy, Governor Ventura's office confirmed that Ventura was a member of the UDT. His spokesman stated that Ventura has never tried to convince people otherwise.&lt;ref name="news.minnesota.publicradio.org"/&gt; Ventura stated, "Today we refer to all of us as SEALs, that's all it is", and dismissed the accusations of lying about being a SEAL as "much ado about nothing".&lt;ref name="news.google.com"/&gt;

Former Navy SEAL [[Brandon Webb (author)|Brandon Webb]], the editor of the website SOFREP.com, wrote a column on the site in which he stated, "Jesse Ventura graduated with Basic Underwater Demolition Class 58 and, like it or not, he earned his status." He disagreed with the argument that Ventura was a UDT and not a SEAL, by stating "try telling that to a WWII UDT veteran who swam ashore before the landing craft on D-Day." He expressed the opinion that "the UDTs and SEALs are essentially one and the same. It's why the UDT is still part of the training acronym BUD/S."&lt;ref name=sofrep&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sofrep.com/36086/truth-jesse-venturas-navy-seal-status/|title=The Truth About Jesse Ventura's Navy SEAL Status|author=Brandon Webb|date= July 11, 2014|accessdate= October 9, 2014|publisher=SOFREP.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chris Kyle controversy===
On January 4, 2012, [[Chris Kyle]], a former U.S. Navy SEAL, promoted his recently released book ''[[American Sniper (book)|American Sniper]]'' on the [[Opie and Anthony | Opie and Anthony Show]]. When Kyle was on the ''Opie and Anthony Show'', a listener called in and asked about how Kyle allegedly punched Ventura in a bar fight. Show host Gregg 'Opie' Hughes asked Kyle about the rumor. Kyle claimed that he punched Ventura in the face at a bar in [[Coronado, California]] which was popular with Navy SEAL personnel. According to Kyle, he did this because Ventura loudly expressed criticism of the [[Iraq War]] back in 2006 during a [[wake (ceremony)|wake]] for [[Michael A. Monsoor]], a Navy SEAL who had been killed in action in Iraq the same year, and who would posthumously receive the [[Medal of Honor]] in 2008. Kyle indicated that Ventura, who was present in [[San Diego]] to give a speech to a graduating [[BUD/S]] class, was "letting it be known he did not agree" with the war in Iraq, and was "bad-mouthing the war, bad-mouthing (former President) Bush, bad-mouthing America."

Although Kyle, who wrote about the alleged incident in his book but did not mention Ventura by name, said he approached Ventura and asked him to tone down his voice because the families of SEAL personnel were present, Ventura allegedly said to Kyle that the SEALs "deserved to lose a few guys." Kyle said he responded by punching Ventura.&lt;ref name=lamothe&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamothe|first1=Dan|title=Jesse Ventura vs. Chris Kyle: A case where no one won|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/07/30/jesse-ventura-vs-chris-kyle-a-case-where-no-one-won/|accessdate=November 21, 2014|work=[[Washington Post]]|publisher=Katharine Weymouth|date=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="navytimes.com"&gt;[[Associated Press]], "[http://www.navytimes.com/news/2012/08/ap-former-seal-book-lawsuit-ventura-082912/ Ex-SEAL’s attorney: Ventura’s claims deficient]", ''[[Military Times]]'', August 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Ventura himself has denied this instance.

Following these interviews, radio host [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]] interviewed Ventura on January 8 regarding what happened. During the interview, Ventura denied the rumors, saying he never met Kyle nor had he heard of him before. Ventura argued that had the confrontation occurred, Kyle would be admitting to assault and that the incident would have become known across the Navy SEAL community, as Ventura had been a member of the UDT/SEALs community. Ventura also stated that the bar, known as McP's, was owned by a former Navy SEAL who was his cadre instructor when in the military, and that he would not misbehave at the bar.

Ventura, reiterating that the incident did not happen, posted a comment on his official Facebook page saying the following:

{{quote|The event this man spoke of never happened. I have been to McP's many times since leaving the Navy. I was never there alone. I was always accompanied by other people. If this happened 6 years ago, someone would have known of it before now. Certainly in the UDT/SEAL community it would have been known. This has to be news to all of us. I have always opposed the war in Iraq but I have never spoken or wished any ill will towards the soldiers. My heart aches that soldiers have died or been wounded because this war should never have taken place. I am perplexed over the agenda this man has and why a fellow Navy Seal would tell a lie about an event that never happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Opelka|first=Mike|title=Navy SEAL Smackdown?

=== Lawsuits against Chris Kyle and HarperCollins Publishing ===

Ventura filed a defamation suit against Kyle in January 2012.&lt;ref name="navytimes.com"/&gt; Ventura initially considered dropping the lawsuit, but said several retired Navy SEALs (including the owner of McP's) demanded that Ventura continue his lawsuit, which Ventura did after Kyle failed to agree on a settlement in which he would state that the incident never happened. In a motion filed by Kyle's attorney in August 2012 to dismiss two of the suit's three counts, declarations by five former SEALs and the mothers of two others supported Kyle's account.&lt;ref&gt;Browing, Dan, ''[[Star Tribune]]'', "[http://www.stripes.com/news/us/ex-seal-jesse-ventura-got-popped-after-popping-off-1.187334 Ex-SEAL: Jesse Ventura got popped after popping off]", ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'', August 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a motion filed by Ventura, Bill DeWitt, a close friend of Ventura and former SEAL who was present with him at the bar, suggested that Ventura interacted with a few SEALs but was involved in no confrontation with Kyle, and said that Kyle's claims were false. DeWitt's wife also said she never witnessed any fight between Kyle and Ventura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanners|first=David|title=Ventura says fellow author just after notoriety|url=http://www.twincities.com/localnews/ci_21592232/jesse-ventura-seal-didnt-deck-me|publisher=twincities.com|accessdate=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Another Win"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/us/jesse-ventura-chris-kyle-navy-seal-book-lawsuit.html |title=$1.8 Million for Ventura in Defamation Case |newspaper=New York Times |date=July 29, 2014 |first=Monica |last=Davey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the lawsuit was ongoing as of 2013, Kyle was [[Eddie Ray Routh|murdered]] in an unrelated incident on February 2, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stanton|first=Jessica|title=Renowned Navy SEAL sniper shot dead at Texas gun range|url=http://dailycaller.com/2013/02/02/renowned-navy-seal-sniper-shot-dead-at-texas-gun-range/|publisher=dailycaller.com|accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, Ventura substituted Taya Kyle, as executor of Chris Kyle's estate, as the defendant, with his lawyers arguing that "it would be unjust to permit the estate to continue to profit from Kyle’s wrongful conduct and to leave Governor Ventura without redress for ongoing damage to his reputation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hopfensperger|first=Jean|title=Former MN Gov.

The [[jury trial]] started on July 8, 2014.  Testimony and arguments were heard until July 22, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nolapatent.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Order-Adopting-Verdict.pdf |title=Jury Verdict adopted by court  |date=August 7, 2014 |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 29, 2014, after a three-week trial in Federal Court in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], including six days of jury deliberations, and upon the agreement of both plaintiff and defendant to accept a divided jury verdict, the jury arrived at an 8 to 2 divided verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and awarded Ventura $1.8 million: $500,000 for [[defamation]] and $1,345,477.25 for [[unjust enrichment]].&lt;ref name="Another Win"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20140729-breaking-jury-awards-jesse-ventura-1.8-million-in-american-sniper-lawsuit.ece |title=Jury awards Jesse Ventura $1.8 million in 'American Sniper' lawsuit |newspaper=Dallas Morning News |date=July 29, 2014 |accessdate=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chris Kyle trial: Jesse Ventura wins $1.8 million in defamation case|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/lake-oswego/index.ssf/2014/07/chris_kyle_trial_jurors_warn_t.html|accessdate=August 1, 2014|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Oregon Live|date=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, 2014, U.S. District Judge [[Richard H. Kyle]] (no relation to Chris Kyle) upheld the jury's award of $500,000 in defamation damages and adopted the jury's advisory award of $1,345,477.25 in unjust enrichment as, "reasonable and supported by a preponderance of the evidence." Attorneys for Kyle's estate said that the defamation damages would be covered by HarperCollins' libel insurance. The unjust enrichment award was not covered by insurance and must be paid from Kyle's estate assets. Following the verdict, HarperCollins announced that it would pull the sub-chapter "Punching out Scruff Face" from all future editions of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.twincities.com/localnews/ci_26299954/venturas-1-8m-award-defamation-trial-ruled-reasonable |title=Jesse Ventura's $1.8M award in defamation trial ruled reasonable |work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]] |date=August 8, 2014 |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a post-trial interview, one juror said that the defense provided a confusing checklist of events, ''e.g.'', that there were multiple locations of where the alleged punch occurred from the defense witnesses and that the defense witnesses were under the influence of alcohol at the time the alleged fight occurred. The juror also stated that Kyle's using a pseudonym for Ventura in the book was to keep it "under wraps" and that, if it were true, then the juror thought Kyle should have used Ventura's name. Additionally, the juror found it compelling from photographs in the days after the alleged punch that Kyle, who was over 6 feet tall, over 200 pounds and in top physical shape, could punch Ventura, who was on blood-thinners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kare11.com/story/news/local/2014/07/11/ventura-testifies-american-sniper-lawsuit/12540345/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20141120070243/http://www.kare11.com/story/news/local/2014/07/11/ventura-testifies-american-sniper-lawsuit/12540345/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=November 20, 2014|title=Ventura testifies in 'American Sniper' lawsuit|work=[[KARE]]|date=July 15, 2014|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; knock him to the ground, and not leave a facial mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.startribune.com/local/269697941.html| title=Aug. 3: Juror describes how jury reached split decision in Jesse Ventura defamation trial |work=[[Star Tribune]] |date=September 4, 2014 |accessdate=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Family===
On July 18, 1975, three days after his twenty-fourth birthday, Ventura married his wife Terry.&lt;ref name=CohenAmazon/&gt; The couple has two children: a son, Tyrel,&lt;ref name=People&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20137480,00.html "Last CallFor Gov. Jesse Ventura—and His Fun-Loving Son Tyrel—the Party Is Over"]. ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]''. Vol. 58 No. 2 July 8, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; who is a film and television director and producer,&lt;ref&gt;Justin, Neal. [http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/blogs/130138483.html "Jesse Ventura hires a familiar face"]. ''[[Star Tribune]]''. September 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and a daughter, Jade.&lt;ref name=People/&gt; With the exception of the first two [[WrestleMania]]s, Ventura would always say hello to "Terry, Tyrel and Jade back in Minneapolis" during his commentary of the annual event. Tyrel also had the honor of inducting his father into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2004)|class of 2004]]. Tyrel also worked on ''[[Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura]]'' and was an investigator in the show's third season.

Ventura and his wife split their time living in both Minnesota and [[Cabo San Lucas]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/shows/conspiracy_theory/bios.html "Meet the Team"]. ''Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura''. [[TruTV]]. Retrieved December 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding his life in Mexico, Ventura said, "I live one hour from pavement and one hour from electricity,..." "I drive down and back every year and it's truly an adventure to live down there where I do, because I'm off the grid,..." "I have electricity but it's all solar. I'm completely solar-powered down there. And it makes you pay more attention. It makes you turn the lights off when you're not using them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0804/01/lkl.01.html "Jesse Ventura Calls for Revolution of Political Parties"]. Transcript of ''[[Larry King Live]]''. April 1, 2008. [[CNN]]. Retrieved December 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steroid use===
During his wrestling days, Ventura used [[anabolic steroid]]s. He admitted this after retiring from competition, and went on to make public service announcements and appear in printed ads and on posters warning young people about the potential dangers and potential health risks of abusing steroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ThisWeek/ucm117728.htm |title=This Week in FDA History |publisher=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health problems===
In 2002, Ventura was hospitalized for a severe [[Thrombus|blood clot]] in his lungs, the same kind of injury that ended his wrestling career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/07/09/ventura/index.html |title=Ventura hospitalized with blood clot in lung |date=July 9, 2002 |accessdate=2008-10-20 |work=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207070454/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/07/09/ventura/index.html |archivedate=December 7, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
In 1999, Ventura said in an interview on [[NBC News]] that he considered himself to be a Christian but did not believe he needs a church to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Religious Affiliation of Jesse Ventura Professional Wrestler and Governor of Minnesota|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pv/Jesse_Ventura.html|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[Playboy]]'' interview, Ventura said, "Organized religion is a [[criticism of religion|sham]] and a crutch for weak-minded people who need strength in numbers. It tells people to go out and stick their noses in other people's business. I live by the [[golden rule]]: Treat others as you'd want them to treat you. The [[christian right|religious right]] wants to tell people how to live."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/01/us/ventura-says-religion-is-for-weak.html Ventura Says Religion Is For Weak] New York Times. October 1, 1999. Retrieved February 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1999 best-selling [[memoir]] ''I Ain't Got Time to Bleed'', Ventura responded to the controversy sparked by these remarks by elaborating on his views concerning religion:

{{quote|I'd like to clarify my comments published in ''Playboy'' about religious people being weak-minded. I didn't mean all religious people. I don't have any problem with the vast majority of religious folks. I count myself among them, more or less. But I believe because it makes sense to me, not because I think it can be proven. There are lots of people out there who think they know the truth about God and religion, but does anybody really know for sure? That's why the [[Founding Fathers]] built freedom of religious belief into the structure of this nation, so that everybody could make up their minds for themselves. But I do have a problem with the people who think they have some right to try to impose their beliefs on others. I hate what the fundamentalist fanatics are doing to our country. It seems as though, if everybody doesn't accept their version of reality, that somehow invalidates it for them. Everybody must believe the same things they do. That's what I find weak and destructive.&lt;ref name=Principles/&gt;}}

In April 2011, Ventura said on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' that he is an [[atheist]] and believes that his beliefs could disqualify him for office in the future, arguing that, "I don't believe you can be an atheist and admit it and get elected in our country."&lt;ref name="The Howard Stern Show"&gt;{{Cite episode |series=Howard Stern Show|title=[[The Howard Stern Show]] |network=[[Sirius XM Radio]] |airdate=April 5, 2011 |minutes=143 |quote=Actually Howard, I can't even run for office anymore.

I don't believe you can be an atheist and admit it and get elected in our country.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an earlier interview with [[CNN]] in October 2010, Ventura denounced religion as the "root of all evil", remarking that "you notice every war is fought over religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1010/15/cnr.08.html |title=Transcripts |publisher=[[CNN]]|date= |accessdate=2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ventura also said in 2012 that he was baptized a Lutheran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karr|first=Christopher|title=Jesse Ventura on Politics, Keith Richards, and Why He's an Atheist|url=http://www.highbrowmagazine.com/1254-jesse-ventura-politics-keith-richards-and-why-hes-atheist|work=Highbrow Magazine|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a staunch critic of religion, Ventura is a supporter of [[religious freedom]]. As governor, he endorsed [[social equality|equal rights]] for [[minority religion|religious minorities]], as well as people who [[Irreligion|do not believe in God]], by declaring July 4, 2002, "Indivisible Day". Ventura inadvertently proclaimed October 13–19, 2002 as "Christian Heritage Week" in Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E7DF1F3BF931A3575BC0A9649C8B63 |title=National Briefing &amp;#124; Midwest: Minnesota: Christians One Up On Ventura|publisher=New York Times |author=Napolitano, Jo|date=August 2, 2002 |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kamber Darbar Samadhi.jpg|thumbnail|right|Kamber Darbar Samadhi]]
The '''Kamber Darbar''' was founded in 1887. The darbar primarily houses the Samadhis of our [[Guru]]s, Sai Vilayatrai, Sai Jiwatsingh, and Sai Vishindas, in a very serene and peaceful environment.

Its purpose is JAP' (chanting) of "OM"; to live life as per Guru’s expectations; selfless Shewa (service) of others and to imbibe humility, love and care for all and kindness.

== Diwali Mela ==
Some "Bhagats"(group of singers) came and voluntarily gave programme of the Darbar in Kambar in 1887 during [[Diwali]] Mela. From then on Sain Jiwat Singh concluded this to be the wish of Guru Wali Vilayvat rai and started to organise Mela during Diwali every year and all the devotees congregate and get the blessings of the Darbar Sahib during Diwali Mela.This tradition is still being continued.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3520">[[File:Udamikumari Shr Kami detail.jpg|thumb|275 px|The ''honden'' at [[Uda Mikumari Shrine]] Kami-gū is made of 3 joined ''Kasuga-zukuri'' buildings]]{{nihongo|'''Kasuga-zukuri'''|春日造}} is a traditional [[Shinto shrine]] architectural style which takes its name from [[Kasuga Taisha]]'s ''[[honden]]''. It is characterized by the use of a building just 1x1 ''[[Ken (architecture)|ken]]'' in size with the entrance on the gabled end covered by a veranda.&lt;ref name="NKS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A ''ken'' is the distance between one supporting pillar and another, a quantity which can vary from shrine to shrine and even within the same building, as in this case.&lt;/ref&gt; In Kasuga Taisha's case, the ''honden'' is just 1.9 m x 2.6 m.&lt;ref name="jaka"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/k/kasugazukuri.htm Kasuga-zukuri], accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporting structures are painted vermilion, while the plank walls are white.&lt;ref name="jaka"/&gt; It has a {{nihongo|''[[tsumairi]]'' (also called ''tsumairi-zukuri'')|妻入・妻入造}} structure, that is, the building has its main entrance on the gabled side.&lt;ref name="jaka"/&gt;

The roof is [[gable]]d ({{nihongo|''kirizuma yane''|切妻屋根|gabled roof}}), decorated with purely ornamental poles called ''[[chigi (architecture)|chigi]]'' (vertical) or ''[[katsuogi]]'' (horizontal), and covered with cypress bark.&lt;ref name="jaka"/&gt;

After the ''[[nagare-zukuri]]'' style, this is the most common [[Shinto shrine]] style. While the first is common all over Japan, however, shrines with a ''kasuga-zukuri'' ''honden'' are found mostly in the [[Kansai region]] around [[Nara, Nara|Nara]].&lt;ref name="ko"&gt;[http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=248 History and Typology of Shrine Architecture], Encyclopedia of Shinto accessed on November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
If a diagonal [[rafter]] (a {{nihongo|''sumigi''|隅木}}) is added to support the portico, the style is called {{nihongo|''sumigi-iri kasugazukuri''|隅木入春日造}}.&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt;

==''Kasuga-zukuri'' and ''nagare-zukuri''==
[[File:Hushimi-inari-taisha honden.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fushimi Inari-taisha|Fushimi Inari Taisha]]'s ''honden'']]While superficially completely different, the ''kasuga-zukuri'' actually shares an ancestry with the most popular style in Japan, the ''[[nagare-zukuri]]''.&lt;ref name="NKS"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nihon Kenchiku-shi|editor=Fujita Masaya, Koga Shūsaku|publisher=Shōwa-dō|date=April 10, 1990|edition=September 30, 2008|isbn=4-8122-9805-9|language=Japanese|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two for example share pillars set over a double-cross-shaped foundation and a roof which extends over the main entrance, covering a veranda. (The Kasuga-zukuri is the only ''tsumairi'' style to possess this last feature.) The foundation's configuration is typical not of permanent, but of temporary shrines, built to be periodically moved. This shows that, for example, both the ''nagare-zukuri'' [[Kamo Shrine]] and Kasuga Taisha used to be dedicated to a mountain cult, and that they had to be moved to follow the movements of the ''[[kami]]''.&lt;ref name="NKS"/&gt; 

The styles also both have a veranda in front of the main entrance, a detail which makes it likely they both evolved from a simple gabled roof.&lt;ref name="NKS"/&gt;

[[File:Calcuttakayasth.jpg|right|thumb|"Calcutta Kayastha", a late 18th-century depiction by [[Frans Balthazar Solvyns]].]]
'''Kayastha''' (also referred to as '''Kayasth''' or '''Kayeth''') is a group consisting of a cluster of several different castes (or sub-groups) of different origin{{cn|date=November 2018}} from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Kayasthas have traditionally acted as scribes, keepers of public records and accounts, and administrators of the state.

Since as early as the dawn of [[Medieval India]], Kayasthas have occupied the highest government offices, serving as ministers and advisors of the [[middle kingdoms of India]] and the [[Mughal Empire]], and holding important administrative positions during the [[British Raj]].

In modern times, Kayasthas have attained success in politics, as well as in the arts and various professional fields.&lt;ref name="IndiaToday"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Arnold P. Kaminsky, Roger D. Long|title=India Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWDnTWrz4O8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA404#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 March 2012|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-37462-3|pages=403–404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

Kayasthas are not a cohesive, uniform group. They have different [[Varna_(Hinduism)|varna]] origins based on the region and consequently different social and ritual status. Even in the same region, such as parts of north and western India, different groups have different ritual status. There are several groups of Kayasthas - a larger group of northern India who claim descent from the sons of [[Chitragupta]]. [[Bengali Kayastha]]s are considered an offshoot of the former group, claiming lineage from migrants to [[Bengal]] from the ancient city of [[Kannauj]] who came at the request of [[Sena Dynasty]] kings in the 10th century. They are called 'Chitraguptavanshi' as they claim descent from Chitragupta. A smaller group found in Maharashtra claims descent from a [[Kshatriya]] warrior named Chandra Sen and this is not considered part of the Chitragupta group.&lt;ref name="Bellenoit2017"/&gt; There are also other groups like Bhimani and Panchob.&lt;ref name="FrontiersMandal"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ancient Indian texts known as the ''[[Puranas]]'', ''Chitraguptavanshi'' Kayasthas are descended from the Hindu god [[Chitragupta]], who is responsible for recording the deeds of humanity, upholding the rule of law, and judging whether human beings go to heaven or hell upon death.&lt;ref name="FrontiersMandal"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. B. Mandal|title=Frontiers in Migration Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mcvhwD5QZKEC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=Kayastha+and+chitragupta#v=onepage&amp;q=Kayastha%20and%20chitragupta&amp;f=false|year=1981|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-03-91-02471-7|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Chitragupta, 12 subcastes of the north Indian chitragupta kayasthas were formed: [[Srivastava]], Gaur, [[Saxena]], [[Mathur (subcaste)|Mathur]],
[[Karan (caste)|Karan]] , [[Nigam]] , [[Bhatnagar]], [[Ambashtha]], Asthana, [[Kulshreshtha]], Valmiki Kayastha and Surajdhwaj Kayastha.  There are several theories of their origin. According to an article in [[India Today]],  Brahmanical religious texts refer to these ''chitraguptavanshi'' Kayasthas as a caste of scribes, recruited in the beginning from the [[Brahmin]], [[Kshatriya]] and [[Vaishya]] castes, but eventually forming distinct subcastes in northern and western India. They have therefore also been mentioned as a "mixed caste", combining Brahman-Shudra (lower caste) and sometimes Kshatriya as well.&lt;ref name="IndiaToday"/&gt;

In eastern India, [[Bengali Kayastha]]s are believed to have evolved from a class of officials into a caste between the 5th/6th centuries and 11th/12th centuries, its component elements being putative Kshatriyas and mostly Brahmins, and likely obtained the aspect of a caste under the [[Sena dynasty]].&lt;ref name="AlHind"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andre Wink|title=Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bCVyhH5VDjAC|accessdate=3 September 2011|year=1991|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|isbn=978-90-04-09509-0|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tej Ram Sharma, an [[Indian people|Indian]] historian, the Kayasthas of Bengal had not yet developed into a distinct caste during the reign of the [[Gupta Empire]], although the office of the Kayastha (scribe) had been instituted before the beginning of the period, as evidenced from the contemporary [[Smriti|''Smritis'']]. Sharma further states:{{quote|"Noticing brahmanic names with a large number of modern Bengali Kayastha cognomens in several early epigraphs discovered in Bengal, some scholars have suggested that there is a considerable brahmana element in the present day Kayastha community of Bengal. Originally the professions of Kayastha (scribe) and [[Vaidya]] (physician) were not restricted and could be followed by people of different varnas including the brahmanas. So there is every probability that a number of brahmana families were mixed up with members of other varnas in forming the present Kayastha and [[Baidya|Vaidya]] communities of Bengal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Tej Ram|title=Personal and Geographical Names in the Gupta Empire|year=1978|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|location=New Delhi |page=115 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcnnB-Lx2MAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Maharashtra, the tiny community of [[Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu]] (or [[CKP]]) claim descent from the warrior Chandrasen. As per Brahminical opinions and texts, they arose solely from the [[Kshatriya]] varna.&lt;ref name="milton87"/&gt;{{efn|quote on page 147: That the "pure Kshatriya"(''shuddha kshatria'') status of the CKP was fully backed up by the actual shastras, was the unofficial verdict of Gangadharshastri Dikshit who was appointed arbiter to resolve the dispute. The famous jurist Ramshastri Prabhune was also in favor of the CKP's vedokta}} Historically, they produced prominent [[warrior]]s and also held positions such as [[Deshpande]]s and Gadkaris (fort holder, an office similar to that of a [[castellan]]&lt;!-- http://trekshitiz.com/trekshitiz/Ei/Rohida-Trek-Hill_forts-Category.html --&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Nineteenth Century History of Maharashtra: 1818–1857|page=121|author = B.

Brahmanical texts i.e [[shastras]] refer to them as "Chandraseniya Kshatriyas". This as well as their 'vedokta' has been formally ratified by the verdicts of the Brahmin councils of Pune and Varanasi, by [[Bajirao II]] and finally the [[Shankaracharya]] himself.&lt;ref name="milton87"&gt;{{cite book|title=Religion and Society in Maharashtra|editor=Milton Israel and N.K.Wagle|publisher=Center for South Asian Studies, University of Toronto, Canada|year= 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|quote on page 173:''Rajvadyanchi Gagabhatti'' appendix 4, pp-1-21.

==History==

===Classical India===
[[Image:Nehru bhulabhaidesai rajendraprasd aicc.png|thumb|right|[[Rajendra Prasad]] (center), who went on to become the first president of India, alongside [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Bhulabhai Desai]] at the All India Congress Committee Session in April 1939]]

Brahmanical religious texts refer to the Chitraguptavanshi Kayasthas as a caste responsible for writing secular documents and maintaining records from the 7th century onward.&lt;ref name="IndiaToday"/&gt;

According to the historical chronicle known as the ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' ("River of Kings"), written by [[Kalhana]] in the 12th century, Kashmiri Kayasthas served as prime ministers and treasury officials under several [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kalhana|title=Kalhana's Rajatarangini: A Chronicle of the Kings of Kashmir|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KzxTkI9iAxkC|accessdate=17 April 2013|year=1989|editor-last=Stein|editor-first=Sir Marc Aurel|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|isbn=978-81-20-80370-1|pages=8, 39, 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 13th century, during the rule of Hindu kings, Bengali Kayasthas dominated public service and had a near-monopoly on appointments to government positions.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

According to [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]], [[Akbar|Emperor Akbar]]'s prime minister, Bengali Kayasthas were rulers of the [[Pala Empire]], one of the major early medieval Indian kingdoms that originated in Bengal.&lt;ref name="AlHind"/&gt;

In Bengal, during the reign of the Gupta Empire beginning in the 4th century, when systematic and large-scale colonization by [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] Kayasthas and Brahmins first took place, Kayasthas were brought over by the Guptas to help manage the affairs of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=U. A. B.

===Medieval India===
After the Muslim conquest of India, they mastered [[Persian language|Persian]],&lt;ref name="IndiaToday"/&gt; which became the official language of the Mughal courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lisa Ballbanlilar|title=Imperial Identity in Mughal Empire: Memory and Dynastic Politics in Early Modern Central Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7PS6PrH3rtkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 June 2012|year=2012|publisher=I.B. Taurus &amp; Co., Ltd.|isbn=978-1-84885-726-1|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some converted to [[Islam]] and formed the [[Muslim Kayasths|Muslim Kayasth]] community in [[North India|northern India]].

One of the most notable north-Indian Kayasthas of the Mughal period was [[Raja Todar Mal]], Emperor Akbar's finance minister and one of the court's nine ''[[Navaratnas]]'', who is credited with establishing the Mughal revenue system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh Tinker|title=South Asia: A Short History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5uU2UteUpEC&amp;dq|accessdate=15 August 2011|year=1990|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1287-4|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also translated the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' from [[Sanskrit]] into [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Rahman | first=M.M. | year=2006 | title=Encyclopaedia of Historiography | publisher=Anmol Publications | isbn=978-81-261-2305-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZCv3d2XUeUC&amp;pg=PA168 | page=168 | accessdate=26 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bengali Kayasthas had been the dominant landholding caste prior to the Muslim conquest, and continued this role under Muslim rule. Indeed, Muslim rulers had from a very early time confirmed the Kayasthas in their ancient role as landholders and political intermediaries.&lt;ref name="RiseofIslam"/&gt;

Bengali Kayasthas served as governors, prime ministers and treasury officials under Mughal rule.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

As a result of their exalted status amongst [[List of rulers of Bengal#Muslim rule|Muslim sultans]], many Bengali Kayasthas became [[zamindar]]s and [[jagirdar]]s. According to Abu al-Fazl, most of the Hindu zamindars in Bengal were Kayasthas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=U. A. B. Razia Akter Banu|title=Islam in Bangladesh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XyzqATEDPSgC&amp;dq|accessdate=15 August 2011|year=1992|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|isbn=978-90-04-09497-0|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pratapaditya|Maharaja Pratapaditya]], the King of [[Jessore]] who declared independence from Mughal rule in the early 17th century, was a Bengali Kayastha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dipesh Chakrabarty|title=The Calling of History: Sir Jadunath Sarkar and His Empire of Truth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMEECgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139|accessdate=10 June 2018|year=2015|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-10045-6|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British India===
[[Image:Subhas Chandra Bose.jpg|thumb|right|[[Subhas Chandra Bose]], President of the [[Indian National Congress]] (1938-1939) and founder of the [[Indian National Army]]]]

During the British Raj, Kayasthas continued to proliferate in public administration, qualifying for the highest executive and judicial offices open to Indians.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Bengali Kayasthas took on the role occupied by merchant castes in other parts of India and profited from business contacts with the British. In 1911, for example, Bengali Kayasthas and Bengali Brahmins owned 40% of all the Indian-owned mills, mines and factories in Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond Lee Owens, Ashis Nandy|title=The New Vaisyas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqUcAAAAMAAJ&amp;q|accessdate=14 August 2011|year=1978|publisher=Carolina Academic Press|isbn=978-0-89089-057-8|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the significant figures of the [[Indian independence movement]] were Bengali Kayasthas, including the spiritual leaders [[Swami Vivekananda]] and [[Sri Aurobindo]], and the revolutionary leader [[Subhas Chandra Bose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Samaren Roy|title=The Bengalees: Glimpses of History and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2e44ZHj_fsQC&amp;pg=PA81|accessdate=26 June 2012|year=1999|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=978-8170239819|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HM Opponent"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sugata Bose|title=His Majesty's Opponent: Subhas Chandra Bose and India's Struggle Against Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g-pfHRAD03AC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=22 June 2012|year=2011|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674047549|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Indian Kayasthas that rose to prominence since independence, include the country's first [[President of India|president]], [[Rajendra Prasad]], and its second [[Prime Minister of India|prime minister]], [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] .&lt;ref name="IndiaToday"/&gt;

Kayasthas are considered a [[Forward Caste]], as they do not qualify for any of the [[Reservation in India|reservation benefits]] allotted to [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes]] and [[Other Backward Class]]es that are administered by the [[Government of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=K.|last1=Srinivasan|first2=Sanjay|last2=Kumar|title=Economic and Caste Criteria in Definition of Backwardness|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=34|issue=42/43|jstor=4408536|date=16–23 October 1999|page=3052}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These ''Chitraguptavanshi'' Kayasthas of United Provinces, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Bengal and Orissa  have been mobilizing through their respective organizations as they feel isolated and feel they are losing opportunities to the backward castes. In this effort, they are aligning themselves with different political parties to gain political and economical advantages and are now demanding 33 percent reservation in Government jobs.&lt;ref name="IT2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnold P.

==Varna status==
The exact ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]]'' status of ''Chitraguptavanshi'' Kayasthas has been a subject of debate. According to some accounts, they are a literate and educated class of Kshatriyas, and they have been referred to as a [[twice-born]] caste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Dushyantha |last=Mendis|title=Electoral Processes and Governance in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7qGHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA427|year=2007|publisher=SAGE Publications India|isbn=978-8-178-29970-9|page=427}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Prem Kumar |last=Jayaswal|title=Librarianship and Bureaucratic Organisation: A Study in the Sociology of Library Profession in India, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gIMQJga7o_oC&amp;pg=PA68|year=1990|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-8-170-22321-4|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bengal]], [[Bengali Kayastha]], alongside [[Bengali Brahmins|Brahmins]], have been described as the "highest Hindu castes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ronald B. |last=Inden|title=Marriage and Rank in Bengali Culture: A History of Caste and Clan in Middle Period Bengal|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=P8b9A7J_v-UC&amp;pg=PA1#|year=1976|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02569-1|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim conquest of India]], Bengali Kayasthas absorbed remnants of Bengal's old Hindu ruling dynasties - including the [[Sena dynasty|Sena]], [[Pala Empire|Pala]], [[Candra|Chandra]], and [[Varman dynasty|Varman]] - and, in this way, became the region's surrogate Kshatriya or "warrior" class. During the [[British Empire|British]] rule, the Bengali Kayasthas, along with the Bengali Brahmins and [[Baidya]]s, were considered as ''Bhadralok'', a term coined in Bengal for the '[[Gentry]]' or 'respectable people'- based on refined culture, prestige, education etc.&lt;ref name="RiseofIslam"&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard Maxwell |last=Eaton|title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204-1760|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gKhChF3yAOUC|year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|pages=102–103|isbn=978-0-52020-507-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Tamil Brahmans: The making of a middle caste|page=212|author = C.J.Fuller, Haripriya Narasimhan|publisher = University of Chicago Press|date = November 11, 2014|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=r7KjBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA212#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=In Bengal, the new middle class emergent under the British rule styled itself 'bhadralok', the gentry or "respectable people", and its principal constituents were the three Bengali high castes, Brahmans, Baidyas, and Kayasthas.

{{Dispute about|British era law courts|date=February 2018}}

The last census of the British Raj in India (1931) classified them as an 'upper caste' i.e. [[Dwija]] and the final British Raj law case involving their varna in 1926 placed them into the [[Kashtriya]] varna.&lt;ref name="ashwani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bellenoit2017" /&gt;

According to W.Rowe's account (that later scholars disagreed with), during the British Raj era, certain law cases led to courts classifying Kayasthas as shudras, based largely upon the theories of [[Herbert Hope Risley]] who had conducted extensive studies on [[castes]] and [[tribes]] of the [[Bengal Presidency]]. According to Rowe, the Kayasthas of Bengal, [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]] and the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] repeatedly challenged this classification by producing a flood of books, pamphlets, family histories and journals to pressurize the government for recognizing them as Kshatriya and to reform the caste practices in the directions of [[sanskritisation]] and [[westernisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Structure and Change in India Society |edition=Reprinted |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2007 |origyear=1968 |chapter=Mobility in the nineteenth-century caste system |first=William L. |last=Rowe |editor1-first=Milton |editor1-last=Singer |editor2-first=Bernard S. |editor2-last=Cohn |isbn=978-0-202-36138-3 |page=202 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_g-_r-9Oa_sC&amp;pg=PA202}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, scholars from the [[University of Berkeley]] as well as the [[University of Cambridge]] have disagreed with Rowe's research by pinpointing
'factual and interpretative errors' in his study as well as criticizing his study for  making 'unquestioned assumptions' about the kayastha movement of [[sanskritisation]] and [[westernisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Cambridge South Asian Studies, Issue 24|publisher = cambridge university press|page=186|year=2007|quote= "In three articles: 1975, 1977 and 1978.

H.Bellenoit gives the details of the individual British Raj era law cases and concludes that since the kayasthas are a non-cohesive group and not a single caste, their [[varna]] was resolved in the cases that came up by taking into account regional differences and customs followed by that particular caste. Bellenoit also disagrees with W.Rowe by showing that Herbert Hope Risley's theories were in fact used to ultimately classify them as [[Kshatriyas]] by the British courts. The first case began in 1860 in [[Jaunpur district|Jaunpur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] with a property dispute where the [[plaintiff]] was considered an 'illegitimate child' by the defendants, a north-Indian Kayastha family. The British court denied inheritance to the child, citing that Kayasthas are [[Dvija]], "twice-born" or "upper-caste" and that the illegitimate children of Dwijas have no rights to inheritance. In the next case in 1875 in the [[Allahabad High Court]], a north Indian Kayastha widow was denied adoption rights as she was an upper-caste i.e. Dwija woman. However, in a 1884 adoption case as well as a 1916 property dispute, [[Calcutta High Court]] argued that Bengali kayasthas have started using names like '[[Das (surname)|Das]]' and classified  the Bengali Kayasthas as shudras - although the court did acknowledge their Kshatriya origin. The Allahabad High Court ruled in 1890 that Kayasthas were Kshatriyas. Finally, in a property dispute case in Patna in 1926, the Patna court characterized both the 1884 and 1916 Calcutta courts rulings as inconclusive and ultimately ruled that the kayasthas were of Kshatriya origin and hence twice born or dwija. The Patna court cited [[smriti]]s and [[Purana]]s, several colonial ethnologists, such as [[William Crooke]] and Herbert Hope Risley, and used their qualified endorsements on the dwija origins of Kayasthas. The British census of 1931 also lists Kayasthas as one of the upper (twice-born) castes.&lt;ref name="Bellenoit2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hayden J.

'''''La Calotte''''' is a French illustrated [[satire|satirical]]  [[anticlerical]] weekly publication, which appeared in France from 1906 to 1912.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb32736598v/date La Calotte]'' sur le site [//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallica Gallica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb32687005r/date Almanach de La Calotte]'', sur le site [//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallica Gallica]&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards the title was resumed from 1930 to the present day, with a change of name under the [[German occupation of France]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.caricaturesetcaricature.com/article-5746169.html La Calotte]'' sur le site  Caricatures et caricature&lt;/ref&gt;

== La Calotte (1906-1911) ==
It was founded in Paris by Louis Grenêche, a publisher, in the context of the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]], during the troubles caused by the Inventories. A powerful anticlerical wave then agitated France.

La Calotte appeared every week on 16 pages, half of which was illustrated with anti-clerical satirical [[Cartoon|drawings]]. The rest consistsed of texts, songs, jokes, denouncing clericalism.

The designers were Saint-Fourien, Asmodée, A. Mac or Chérubin.

In its first issue of 14 September 1906, the editorial explains:{{Quote|text=&lt;span id="result_box" class="" lang="en"&gt;     &lt;span&gt;You can see, dear readers, the fighting character of La Calotte.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;We &lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;have but one weapon: laughter, the only weapon feared by the soldiers  of Tartuffe, is to tell you that we shall not lack enemies who will try  to stifle us by all means.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt;If you share our  opinion, dear readers, insist on kiosks and newsagents, which are our  only sellers, so that they display us in good place.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="alt-edited"&gt;You will support our cause as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|Vous pouvez vous rendre compte, chers lecteurs, de l’allure combattive de La Calotte. Nous n’avons qu’une arme : le rire, seule arme que redoutent les soldats de Tartuffe, c’est vous dire que nous ne manquerons pas d’ennemis qui chercheront à nous étouffer par tous les moyens. Si vous partagez notre avis, chers lecteurs, insistez auprès des kiosques et marchands de journaux, qui sont nos seuls vendeurs, afin qu’ils nous affichent en bonne place. Vous soutiendrez ainsi notre cause}}

== Resumption of title after 1930 ==
[[Civil libertarianism|Libertarian]] activist and free thinker [[André Lorulot]] took over this title in the 1930s. The designers who worked there were Armangeol (Armand Gros) who produced comic Bibles, satirical ''Lives of Jesus ''and ''History of the Popes'' illustrated with satirical drawings.

During the 1939-1945 war, ''La Calotte ''changed its title to ''La Vague'', still under the direction of Lorulot, who stigmatized the ties between the [[Catholic Church]] and [[fascism]]. ''La Vague'' denounces [[antisemitism]]. 

After the war ''La Calotte'' became the organ of La Libre Pensee. It was a monthly publication from November 1945 on.

After the death of André Lorulot, H. Perrodo-Le Moyne became its director (May 1963). He writes articles and draws under the signature of ''P. Le M''..

The title still exists on subscription.

== ''La Calotte'' of Marseille ==
[[File:La_Calotte_(Marseille).jpg|right|thumb|290x290px|''La Calotte'' (Marseille), No. 28, February 20, 1898.]]
Another satirical weekly of the same name was published in Marseilles, between 1897 and 1906, with a pause between 1903 and 1905.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb32736601x/date La Calotte]'' de Marseille sur le site [//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallica Gallica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.caricaturesetcaricature.com/article-la-calotte-de-marseille-une-revue-anticlericale-et-libre-penseuse-satirique-81615235.html La Calotte]'' de Marseille, sur le site Caricatures et caricature&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first civilizations of human history, the '''[[Sindhis]]''' have a rich and clearly distinct cultural heritage and are very festive. The most important festival for Hindu Sindhis is the birthday of Lord [[Jhulelal (Hinduism)|Jhoolelal]] and [[Cheti Chand]].

==Sindhi Hindus festivals==
'''1. [[Cheti Chand]]'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festivalsofindia.in/ChetiChand/ Cheti Chand festival]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Celebration of the birth of the Water god (Varun Devta) Sai Uderolal, popularly known as [[Jhulelal (Hinduism)|Jhoolelal]] . So much has been said and written about it that it would be superfluous to mention the event again. In [[Sindh]] the beginning of the New Year was considered Cheti Chand . Some businessmen opened new account books on Cheti Chand; many however, did that on the eve of [[Diwali]]. On the full moon day, people used to go to a river or lake and offer 'Akho' with a pinch of rice mixed with milk and flour. If there was no river or 'Darya', the ritual was performed at a well. Even Sindhi Sikhs go to [[temples]] or [[Gurudwaras]], because Guru Nanak's birthday also falls on Pūrnima.

'''2. Sagra (Sacred thread)''' 
Sindhi [[Bhaiband]]s often lived in foreign countries; therefore, their wives were always worried about the good health of their husbands. For this purpose they performed [[puja (Hinduism)|pooja]] and fasted on four Mondays of Sawan month, after which they perform pooja, distribute sweet rice and then had the sacred thread tied on the wrist by the priest ( Bandhan ). Here in India, the priests have made a show business which costs nearly 500-800 [[rupees]], a money making gimmick.

'''3. Mahalakshmi's Sacred Thread (Mahalakshmi-a-jo-Sagro)''' 
This sacred thread had 16 strips and 17 days. On the day when the sacred thread was to be untied, it was celebrated as an important day and special savouries like satpura and pakwan of Suji &amp; Maida were made and distributed firstly to the priests and the poor and afterwards the remaining savouries were used by family members.

'''4. Fasts''' 
In [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]]s, generally Mondays &amp; Saturdays, Giyaras or Umaas were observed as fasts ( vrats ). During the fast of Satyanarayan and nine days of Ekaanaas, only one time meal was generally taken.

'''5. Teejri'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jhulelal.com/calender/Teejri.htm Tejri festival]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
This festival takes place in the month of Sawan when married women and girls paint their hands and feet with Mehndi, go on fast for the whole day, during which they used to play games, swing in Jhulas and sing love songs. Orthodox or strict Sindhi women do not even drink a sip of water until they break their fast. In the night after making an offering to the moon, they would break the fast. This is also referred to as the Sindhi version of Karwa Chauth &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karwachauth.com/karwa-chauth-story.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''6. Akhan Teej'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sindhiinfo.com/festival/akhanteej.asp Akhan Teej festival]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In Sindh, [[Akshaya Tritiya]] is known as Akhandi which is celebrated in [[Vaisakha]]. On this day new earthen pots of water(matkas) were kept and everyone was offered clean and cool water. The significance of this day was to offer water to the thirsty. Hence at every nook and corner, sharbat, with pieces of apple in it, was offered to passersby along with 'prasad' . On this day, it was also customary to send new earthen pots and fruits to priests and Gurdwara.

'''7. AUnn-Matyo''' 
In the month of Sawan, on the Baaras of Krishna Paksha, cereals were changed in food, i.e. instead of wheat and rice, chapatis made of gram flour (Besan) were eaten.

'''8. Ban Badhri''' 
During the month of 'Bado', during the Baaras of Shukla Paksha, god Varun had taken avtaar . In lieu of that small insects like ants etc. were fed Gur (jaggery) and Musti . Married daughters are invited by their parents for meals.

'''9. Somavati Umaas''' 
During certain months Umaas takes place on a Monday. That day is considered important for having a "dumb dip' in the waters; without talking to anyone early in the morning. It is also, called 'Gungee Umaas" .

'''10. Nandhi and Vaddi Thadri''' 
Both of these take place in the month of Sawan . On the day before Thadree day, people cook lola (sweet flour cakes) and rote (fried cakes) because there has to be no lighting of fire in the house on the Thadree day. The lolas and Rotes are eaten with curd or pickle. On that day drops of water are also sprinkled on the cooking fire to appease Sitladevi Mata.

'''11. Janamashtami, Ram Navmi and Shivratri''' 
Since [[Krishna]] was born after midnight, on Janamashtami, bhajans and kirtan are held in temples till midnight. On Ram Navmi, Lord Rama's birthday is celebrated. On Shivratri people drink 'Thaadhal' with some 'bhang' in it, after making offering of it in the Mahadev temple. In the villages and cities, big pots of 'Taahri' (sweet rice) are prepared and distributed among all.

'''12. Tirmoori''' 
On this festive day parents send ladoos &amp; chiki ( Laaee ) made of Tils to their married daughters. On the Makar Sankrant day the sun moves from south to north. It is therefore also called 'utraan' or 'Tirmoori' . In Mahabharat battle Bhisham Pitamah did not breathe his last till ‘ utraan' since on this day there happens flush of light in Dev Lok .

'''13. [[Dussehra]]''' 
Few days before [[Dussehra]] there used to be Ramlila program which was attended by throngs of people. On the [[Dussehra]] day colourful effigies of [[Ravana]], [[Kumbhakarna]] and [[Indrajit|Meghnath]] were burnt.

'''14. Diyaaree''' 
Two days before [[Diwali]], Sindhis start lighting Diyaas (earthen lamps) from 'Dhan Teras' . The bazaars are full with prospective consumers. Friends and relatives meet one another with affection and extended pleasantries and sweetmeats. In the night, Laxmi Poojan takes place when all the members of the family pray with reverence and respect. In the night, people used to take in their hands a stick to which a rag dipped in oil was tied which was burnt. It was called 'Mollawaro' ; everyone shouted 'Mollawaro ... . Mollawaro' ...

'''15. The Giyaras of Kati''' 
Before the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, on this day people in Sindh used to be engaged in giving charity. The whole bazaar would be full with hundreds of beggars and the needy, who would spread a cloth before them, on which people, according to their might, would throw money, Bhugra, fruits etc. The jugglers used to arrange their Tamashas on the road with monkeys and bears dancing on the tunes played by the jugglers. An atmosphere of gaiety and gay prevailed all through the day.

'''16. [[Navratra]]''' 
During this days devotees of Devi ate one meal a day and did not even shave and cut hair. Ladies sang bhajans . In [[Nagarparkar]] they used to dance like Garba in Gujrat.

'''17. Lal Loi'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jhulelalmandir.com/activity.php Lal Loi festival]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; In some parts of Sindh,  the Sindhi community celebrated Laal Loi ([[Lohri]]) on the 13th of January every year. During Lal Loi kids used to bring wood sticks from their grand parents and aunties and like a fire camp burnt these sticks in the night with people enjoying, dancing and playing around fire. Some ladies whose wishes were fulfilled offered coconuts in the fire and distributed prasad 'Sesa' ; this continued till midnight.

'''18. Rakhri'''&lt;br&gt;  
During the Purnima of Sawan month, according to Daswani and Parchani (1978) the family priest in Sindh "traditionally tied a rakhi on the entire family while the ritual of a sister tying the [[Raksha Bandhan|Rakhi]] round a brother's wrist has been borrowed as a result of non-Sindhi influence in North India."&lt;ref&gt;Chander J. Daswani, S. Parchani (1978) Sociolinguistic Survey of Indian Sindhi. Central Institute of Indian Languages [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EedjAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=sindh+raksha+bandhan+north+india+influence&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=entire+family]&lt;/ref&gt; In this festival, sisters tie a [[Raksha Bandhan|Rakhi]] to their brothers. This day is called "Rakhree Bandhan'. People in cities and places near rivers or the sea, used to offer coconuts and milk to the God of Waters 'Varun Devta so that those who were travelling in ships and boats should have a safe and sound journey.

'''19. Shraadh''' 
Just as in India the month of September 'Bado' was meant for Krishna Paksha as Pitar Pakhiya. Any member of the family who had died on particular (tithi) day and date, a Shraadh was offered for the solace of the deceased's soul. The Brahmins were given food and Dakhshna. It is said that Arya Samaj carried out a strong movement against Shraadh, but the Shraadhs continued because of the faith of people since they felt that through this method the deceased members of the family are remembered and all the family members have a good gathering.

'''20. Nagapanchmi ([[Gogro]])''' 
During those days whenever the snake charmer brought snakes, they were given some Dakhshna and also milk for the snakes. Nagpanchami is also called [[Gogro]]. It is a folklore from Kutch and Gujarat.

'''21. [[Holi]]''' 
The festival of colours in which all the young and old join together to express their joy at the change of season. Some people correlate Holi festival with Holika, the sister of Hirnakashyap, mythological father of Bhagat Prahlad.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1442">'''Manuel Antonio Acevedo''' (1770 – 1 October 1825) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] statesman, lawyer and priest. He was a representative to the [[Congress of Tucumán]] which on 9 July 1816 [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declared the Independence of Argentina]].

Acevedo was born in [[Salta]] and studied in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], following an ecclesiastical career at the [[Montserrat School]]. He was ordained a priest on 8 December 1794 and served in [[Cachi, Argentina|Cachi]], then [[Molinos, Salta|Molinos]] in [[Salta Province]], and later in [[Belén, Catamarca|Belén]], [[Catamarca Province]].

In 1815 Acevedo was elected by [[San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca|Catamarca]] to the [[Tucumán Congress]] and served in 1816 for the declaration. He supported the idea of a constitutional [[Inca]]n monarchy. After the Congress moved to Buenos Aires, he served as president of the body. He then returned to his parish in Belén. In 1824 he again represented Catamarca in the General Congress.

'''Medieval women's mysticism''' was "a succession of insights and revelations about God that gradually transformed the recipient" according to historian Elizabeth Petroff of Oxford University in her 1994 book, ''Body and Soul.''&lt;ref name=Petroff&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petroff|first1=Elizabeth Alvilda|title=Body and soul : essays on medieval women and mysticism|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195084543|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "[[mysticism]]" has its origin in ancient Greece where individuals called the ''mystae'' participated in mystery religions.&lt;ref name=Petroff /&gt; The life of a medieval woman mystic was spent seeking unity with God in a series of stages.&lt;ref name="Shambhala"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Monica|title=Visions &amp; longings : medieval women mystics|date=1996|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston|isbn=157062125X|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mystical life of a medieval woman began with a purge of the spirit in which she released herself from earthly indulgences and attachments.&lt;ref name=furlong&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Monica|title=Visions &amp; longings : medieval women mystics|date=1996|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston|isbn=157062125X|pages=2|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a state of contrition the medieval woman mystic faced suffering because of her past sins, and the mercy of God was revealed to her through penitence.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Ellen. (1993) "'She Wept and Cried Right Loud for Sorrow and for Pain': Suffering, the Spiritual Journey, and Women's Experience in Late Medieval Mysticism." In ''Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics'' edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 45-59. New York: Syracuse University. p 54.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian mysticism|Mystics]] sought to imitate the suffering of Christ in order to gain an understanding through experience.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Ellen. (1993) "'She Wept and Cried Right Loud for Sorrow and for Pain': Suffering, the Spiritual Journey, and Women's Experience in Late Medieval Mysticism." In ''Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics'' edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 45-59. New York: Syracuse University. p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; During the compassion stage of suffering, the pain experienced by the medieval woman mystic "revealed the believer's love of Christ, fostered unity with Christ and the world, and began to draw the believer beyond the physical Jesus who suffered on the Cross to understand the immensity of the love that motivated Christ in the world to suffer on humanity's behalf".&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Ellen. (1993) "'She Wept and Cried Right Loud for Sorrow and for Pain': Suffering, the Spiritual Journey, and Women's Experience in Late Medieval Mysticism." In ''Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics'' edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 45-59. New York: Syracuse University. p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval women mystics experienced visions during what medieval historians refer to as the Illuminative stage of their lives that contained instructions from God&lt;ref name="Shambhala"/&gt; and would communicate their revelations in written form.&lt;ref name=Petroff /&gt;

==Medieval women as visionaries==
Visions occurred to the mystic in the form of raptures or ecstasies, out-of-body experiences&lt;ref name=Elliott&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=Dyan|title=Proving woman : female spirituality and inquisitional culture in the later Middle Ages|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691118604|pages=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which the mystic was in a state of immobility, unresponsive to and disconnected from the outside world.&lt;ref name=Elliott /&gt; The visions of most female mystics during the Middle Ages came in the form of mental images.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=Dyan|title=Proving woman : female spirituality and inquisitional culture in the later Middle Ages|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691118604|pages=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; &gt; Medieval women mystics were considered prophets by their communities.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Furlong|editor-first1=Monica|title=Visions &amp; longings : medieval women mystics|date=1997|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston|isbn=1570623147|pages=9|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Ages, medieval interpretations of Biblical passages such as Corinthians 14:34&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1 Corinthians 14:34|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+14%3A34&amp;version=KJV|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in women being excluded from the Church's hierarchy and lacking the authority to impart Biblical wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Monica|title=Visions &amp; longings : medieval women mystics|date=1997|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston|isbn=1570623147|pages=8|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, medieval women were thought to be more susceptible to experiencing a rapture based on Galen's writings on [[Humorism|humor theory.]]&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=Dyan|title=Proving woman : female spirituality and inquisitional culture in the later Middle Ages|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691118604|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval theologians interpreted the feminine softness and coldness described by [[Galen]] as evidence that women were more impressionable to visions.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Also, the Christian idea that God used humble beings as his vessels supported the ability of Medieval women to act as mystics.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Authorization and legitimacy==
The legitimacy of the medieval woman mystic was gained through partnership with the [[History of the Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=Dyan|title=Proving woman : female spirituality and inquisitional culture in the later Middle Ages|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691118604|pages=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; and observed proof of physical suffering and deterioration. Medieval women mystics lived [[Ascetical theology|ascetic]] lives of severe fasting, abstinence, and isolation&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; lifestyle choices that became physically debilitating and in some instances resulted in death.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=Dyan|title=Proving woman : female spirituality and inquisitional culture in the later Middle Ages|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691118604|pages=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval women mystics also used self-denigration in the published versions of their visions in order to both gain clerical approval of their revelations and showcase their status as God's humble servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Monica|title=Visions &amp; longings : medieval women mystics|date=1997|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston|isbn=1570623147|pages=17|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical proof===
The proof of a medieval woman's mystical ability was shown through physical suffering due to mortification of the flesh and by the wounds that symbolized the mystic's connection to Christ.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Finke, Laurie A. (1993) "Mystical Bodies and the Dialogics of Vision." In Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 28-45. New York: Syracuse University. p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the [[Stigmata]] on a mystic's body served as divine evidence of her ability to communicate with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=Dyan|title=Proving woman : female spirituality and inquisitional culture in the later Middle Ages|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691118604|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another sign of mystical ability was observed bleeding on Fridays during the hour of the [[Crucifixion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Monica|title=Visions &amp; longings : medieval women mystics|date=1997|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston|isbn=1570623147|pages=27|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the Middle Ages the physical deterioration of the woman mystic's body was considered proof of her sanctity.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; Medieval women mystics were marked as special instances of God's grace because of their choice to suffer.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

===Support from the Catholic Church===
Medieval women mystics were endorsed by the Church to reaffirm [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] religion through their visions.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The Latin church of the Middle Ages fought [[Heresy in Christianity|heresy]] with [[Scholasticism]] and the [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]] and 
placed emphasis on the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]] and models of exemplary religiosity.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Mystics supported the Catholic Church's teaching of suffering on others' behalf in visionary journeys to [[Purgatory]] where they encountered suffering souls.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, Jo Ann. (1993) "The Rhetoric of Orthodoxy: Clerical Authority and Female Innovation in the Struggle with Heresy" In ''Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics'' edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 9-27. New York: Syracuse University. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval women mystics believed that their physical mortifications served as purgation for the sinful dead.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;McNamara, Jo Ann. (1993) "The Rhetoric of Orthodoxy: Clerical Authority and Female Innovation in the Struggle with Heresy" In ''Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics'' edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 9-27. New York: Syracuse University. p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; Through prayer medieval women mystics released souls from Purgatory.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

Medieval women mystics showed particular obedience to their confessor.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=Dyan|title=Proving woman : female spirituality and inquisitional culture in the later Middle Ages|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691118604|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confession became a key part of female piety because of the [[Fourth Lateran Council |Fourth Lateran Council of 1215]]&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; which made confession a more integral part of medieval life. During confession, female mystics would discuss their revelations and establish a partnership with their confessor, who often circulated the accounts of the mystic's revelations throughout the Christian community.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; The authorization of the Catholic Church distinguished the heretic from the pious mystic. The mystic [[Marguerite Porete]] was burned for heresy by the inquisition in France in 1310 after her text ''[[The Mirror of Simple Souls]]'' was deemed unorthodox.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petroff|first1=Elizabeth Alvilda|title=Body and soul : essays on medieval women and mysticism|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195084543|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[Hildegard of Bingen]] became an ally of [[Pope Eugenius III]] and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] in their fight against German heresy in 1147.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, Jo Ann. (1993) "The Rhetoric of Orthodoxy: Clerical Authority and Female Innovation in the Struggle with Heresy" In Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 9-27. New York: Syracuse University. p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Petroff, Medieval women mystics "inspired Christian leaders who synthesized Christian tradition and proposed new models for the Christian community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petroff|first1=Elizabeth Alvilda|title=Body and soul : essays on medieval women and mysticism|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195084543|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mysticism in Beguine communities==
[[Beguines and Beghards|Beguine communities]] originated in Northern Europe during the twelfth century.&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petroff|first1=Elizabeth Alvilda|title=Body and soul : essays on medieval women and mysticism|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195084543|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beguines were groups of women who lived together, supported themselves through manual labor, provided charity to the sick and the poor, and devoted their lives to spiritual growth.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt; The Beguines also performed acts of penitence such as [[Flagellant|self-flagellation]], fasting, and vigils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petroff|first1=Elizabeth Alvilda|title=Body and soul : essays on medieval women and mysticism|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195084543|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beguine communities were supported by [[Pope Gregory IX]] during the thirteenth century and sparked a resurgence in female religiosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=Dyan|title=Proving woman : female spirituality and inquisitional culture in the later Middle Ages|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691118604|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beguine mystics were seen as the [[Bride of Christ|brides of Christ]] and living saints during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=Dyan|title=Proving woman : female spirituality and inquisitional culture in the later Middle Ages|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691118604|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growing suspicion in the later Middle Ages==
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, from the thirteenth century onward, women mystics faced greater scrutiny due to the growing prominence of inquisitional procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=Dyan|title=Proving woman : female spirituality and inquisitional culture in the later Middle Ages|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691118604|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany during the fourteenth century, the clergy began to greatly restrict the religious lives of women. The [[Council of Vienne]], in 1311, condemned religious women who preached and lived outside a monastery without the direct supervision of a cleric, thus putting an end to the Beguine movement.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, Jo Ann. (1993) "The Rhetoric of Orthodoxy: Clerical Authority and Female Innovation in the Struggle with Heresy" In Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 9-27. New York: Syracuse University. p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholastics in the universities began to propose that inquisitional processes should be employed to weed out heresy among women mystics. [[Jean Gerson]], a chancellor of the University of Paris, believed the church's corruption and laxity was the cause of widespread acceptance of female mystics.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, Jo Ann. (1993) "The Rhetoric of Orthodoxy: Clerical Authority and Female Innovation in the Struggle with Heresy" In Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 9-27. New York: Syracuse University. p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerson wanted to create a permanent post of the Inquisition that investigated mystics and their visions.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, Jo Ann. (1993) "The Rhetoric of Orthodoxy: Clerical Authority and Female Innovation in the Struggle with Heresy" In Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 9-27. New York: Syracuse University. p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Rhineland and Southern France from 1318 to 1328, [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] inquisitors began to burn Beguines and other religious women at the stake in response to the papal bull ''Quum Inter Nonnullos''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/QINN-E.HTM ''Quum inter nonnullos'' (English translation 1)]; [http://www.franciscan-archive.org/bullarium/qinn-e.html ''Quum inter nonnullos''(English translation 2)]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[John XXII]] which condemned poverty-based religiosity.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, Jo Ann. (1993) "The Rhetoric of Orthodoxy: Clerical Authority and Female Innovation in the Struggle with Heresy" In Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 9-27. New York: Syracuse University. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the fifteenth century, the mystical marriage of the medieval woman mystic's marriage with Christ had come to be viewed as a copulation with devil by the Dominicans.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, Jo Ann. (1993) "The Rhetoric of Orthodoxy: Clerical Authority and Female Innovation in the Struggle with Heresy" In Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 9-27. New York: Syracuse University. p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some notable medieval women mystics==

===Catherine of Siena (1347-1380)===
[[Catherine of Siena]] was the daughter of a lower-class wool dyer and lived through the Black Death. She vowed her virginity to God at the age of seven. At fifteen she cut her hair in protest of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petroff|first1=Elizabeth Alvilda|title=Body and soul : essays on medieval women and mysticism|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195084543|pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; After she was scarred by a case of smallpox at seventeen, her parents allowed her to join a third-order Dominican group called the Mantellate due to her reduced marriage prospects.&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petroff|first1=Elizabeth Alvilda|title=Body and soul : essays on medieval women and mysticism|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195084543|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine chose to remain at home and it was there, at the age of twenty, that she experienced a "mystical espousal" where she became one with Christ.&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt; Catherine was an active minister to the poor and sick and became renowned.

In 1378 Catherine of Siena published her visions in the ''Dialogue''.&lt;ref name="auto11"/&gt; The ''Dialogue'' tells of a conversation between Catherine and God where God explains that Christ's crucifixion created a bridge between earth and heaven.

===Margery Kempe (circa 1373-after 1439)===
[[Margery Kempe]] was born in King's Lynn in Norfolk, England.&lt;ref name="auto12"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Furlong|editor-first1=Monica|title=Visions &amp; longings : medieval women mystics|date=1997|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston|isbn=1570623147|pages=165|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She married John Kempe at the age of twenty and suffered a series of health-afflicting pregnancies.

===Julian of Norwich (1342-after 1416)===
[[Julian of Norwich]] was an [[anchorite|anchoress]] at the Church of Saint Julian at Conisford, England. Little is known of her family background but she lived during the [[Hundred Years War]] and [[Western Schism|Great Schism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Furlong|editor-first1=Monica|title=Visions &amp; longings : medieval women mystics|date=1997|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston|isbn=1570623147|pages=187|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julian lived in an anchorhold which was a small house isolated from the community with few rooms and a garden used for sustenance. In 1373 she experienced the "Showings," which was a mystical experience in which numerous revelations and images were revealed to her at one time. In the "Showings" Julian witnessed the Crucifixion, had a conversation with Christ, then witnessed the Virgin Mary during the Annunciation, and saw an image of the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Furlong|editor-first1=Monica|title=Visions &amp; longings : medieval women mystics|date=1997|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston|isbn=1570623147|pages=189|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another vision of Julian is of the Lord and a servant who in attempting to leave to do God's will stumbles and suffers in pain. According to Julian, the servant represents Adam and humankind, is unaware that the Lord continues to look upon the servant with grace and kindness despite his failings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Petroff|editor-first1=Elizabeth Alvilda|title=Medieval women's visionary literature|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195037111|pages=309–310|edition=1. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julian published her visions in the 1395 book ''[[Revelations of Divine Love]]''.

===Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179)===
The religious career of [[Hildegard of Bingen]] began at seven when she joined her aunt Jutta, a recluse.&lt;ref name="auto14"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petroff|first1=Elizabeth Alvilda|title=Body and soul : essays on medieval women and mysticism|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195084543|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their retreat was later turned into a convent where Hildegard became a nun at fourteen.&lt;ref name="auto14"/&gt; She wrote letters, visions, prophecies, songs, and morality plays. She was known as a prophet to all her contemporaries such as Bernard of Clairvaux.&lt;ref name="auto14"/&gt; Hildegard had visions since the age of five. According to her she experienced two types of spiritual visions: "the Living Light" in which she could see nothing and "the Shade of the Living Light" where there was a diffused radiance.&lt;ref name="auto14"/&gt;

In ''Scivias'', published between 1151 and 1152, Hildegard recounted twenty six visions. A description of one her visions in Book 2 in ''Scivias''illustrates the form in which divine revelation manifested to her: 
"Then I saw a most splendid light, and in the light, the whole of which burnt in a most beautiful, shining fire, was the fire of a man of the sapphire colour, and that most splendid light poured over the whole of that shining fire, and the shining fire over all that splendid light, and that most splendid light and shining fire over the whole figure of the man, appearing one light in one virtue and power. And again I heard that living Light saying to me: This is the meaning of the mysteries of God, that it may be discerned and understood discreetly what that fulness may be, which is without beginning and to which nothing is wanting, who by the most powerful strength plated all the strong places."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Petroff|editor-first1=Elizabeth Alvilda|title=Medieval women's visionary literature|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195037111|pages=152–153|edition=1. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marguerite Porete (1250-1310)===
[[Marguerite Porete]] was a French Beguine from Hainault who lived during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth century. She published ''The Mirror of Simple Souls'' in the vernacular French and was arrested on charges of heresy in 1310. She refused to give testimony during her inquisition trial in Paris.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; The University of Paris, after surveying some passages of her book, deemed her a relapsed heretic because she had been accused instances prior to her last arrest.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; Porete sent her book to three scholars who approved and published the text. ''The Mirror of Simple Souls'' was widely circulated and translated into Latin, Italian, and Middle English.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; Unlike other female mystics, Porete publicly taught the message of her revelations. Similar to Hildegard of Bingen she dispensed with male ecclesiastic representation. However, in the case of Porete she was found guilty by the Inquisition and burned at the stake in 1310.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petroff|first1=Elizabeth Alvilda|title=Body and soul : essays on medieval women and mysticism|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195084543|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Mirror of Simple Souls'' Porete explained the different states of the soul. She explained: "And therefore this Soul knows only him, and loves only him, praises only him, for there is only he. Because what is exists by his goodness, and God loves his goodness whenever he has bestowed it, and his goodness bestowed is God himself, and God cannot depart from his goodness so that it doesn't dwell in him, thus he is what goodness is and goodness is what God is. And therefore Goodness sees itself by means of his goodness through divine light in the sixth state, by which the Soul is purified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Petroff|editor-first1=Elizabeth Alvilda|title=Medieval women's visionary literature|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195037111|pages=298|edition=1. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[demon]] '''Naberius''' was first mentioned by [[Johann Weyer]] in 1583.&lt;ref name="Wier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deliriumsrealm.com/delirium/articleview.asp?Post=304|title=Demonology, Fallen Angels, and the Philosophy of Good and Evil - DeliriumsRealm.com|website=www.deliriumsrealm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is supposedly the most valiant [[Marquess]] of [[Hell]], and has nineteen legions of [[demon]]s under his command. He makes men cunning in all arts (and sciences, according to most authors), but especially in [[rhetoric]], speaking with a hoarse voice. He also restores lost dignities and honors, although to Johann Weyer he procures the loss of them.

==Description==
Naberius appears as a three-headed [[dog]] or a [[raven]]. He has a raucous voice but presents himself as eloquent and amiable. He teaches the art of gracious living. He has also been depicted as a [[Corvus (genus)|crow]] or a black [[crane (bird)|crane]].

Concerning his name, it is unclear if there is an association with the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Cerberus]]. It is said that in 1583, Johann Weyer considers both of them to be the same demon. He claimed:
&lt;blockquote style="font-style:italic"&gt;
"Naberius [Naberus], alias Cerberus, is a valiant marquesse, shewing himselfe in the forme of a crowe, when he speaketh with a hoarse voice: he maketh a man amiable and cunning in all arts, and speciallie in rhetorike, he procureth the losse of prelacies and dignities: nineteene legions heare (and obeie) him."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Other spellings'': [[Cerberus]], Cerbere, Naberus.

'''Neferneferuaten Nefertiti''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|ɛ|f|ər|ˈ|t|iː|t|i}}&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/nefertiti?showCookiePolicy=true|title=Nefertit or Nofretete|accessdate=24 September 2014|publisher=Collins Dictionary|date=n.d.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923230745/http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/nefertiti?showCookiePolicy=true|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) ([[Circa|c.]] 1370&amp;nbsp;– c. 1330 BC) was an Egyptian queen and the [[Great Royal Wife]] (chief consort) of [[Akhenaten]], an [[Pharaoh|Egyptian Pharaoh]]. Nefertiti and her husband were known for a religious revolution, in which they worshiped one god only, [[Aten]], or the sun disc. With her husband, she reigned at what was arguably the wealthiest period of Ancient Egyptian history.&lt;ref&gt;RE Freed, S D'Auria, YJ Markowitz, (1999) "Pharaohs of the Sun: Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Tutankhamen" (Museum of Fine Arts, Leiden)&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe that Nefertiti ruled briefly as [[Neferneferuaten]] after her husband's death and before the accession of [[Tutankhamun]], although this identification is [[Neferneferuaten#Nefertiti|a matter of ongoing debate]].&lt;ref name="Dodson"&gt;Dodson, Aidan, Amarna Sunset: Nefertiti, Tutankhamun, Ay, Horemheb, and the Egyptian Counter-Reformation.

"The Year 16 graffito of Akhenaten in Dayr Abū Ḥinnis: A contribution to the study of the later years of Nefertiti." Journal of Egyptian History 7:67-108.&lt;/ref&gt; If Nefertiti did rule as Pharaoh, her reign was marked by the fall of [[Amarna]] and relocation of the capital back to the traditional city of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Badger Utopia|title=Nefertiti - Mummy Queen of Mystery|date=2017-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czSww5m39q4&amp;t=2259s|accessdate=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nefertiti had many titles including Hereditary Princess ([[Iry-pat|iryt-p`t]]); Great of Praises (wrt-hzwt); Lady of Grace (nbt-im3t), Sweet of Love (bnrt-mrwt); Lady of The Two Lands (nbt-t3wy); Main King's Wife, his beloved (hmt-niswt-‘3t meryt.f); Great King's Wife, his beloved (hmt-niswt-wrt meryt.f), Lady of all Women (hnwt-hmwt-nbwt); and Mistress of Upper and Lower Egypt (hnwt-Shm’w-mhw).&lt;ref&gt;Grajetzki, Ancient Egyptian Queens: A Hieroglyphic Dictionary, Golden House Publications, London, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-9547218-9-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was made famous by [[Nefertiti Bust|her bust]], now in [[Neues Museum|Berlin's Neues Museum]]. The bust is one of the most copied works of [[ancient Egypt]]. It was attributed to the sculptor [[Thutmose (sculptor)|Thutmose]], and it was found in his [[workshop]]. The bust is notable for exemplifying the understanding Ancient Egyptians had regarding realistic facial proportions.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Nefertiti, Egyptian Nfr.t-jy.tj, for "the beauty has come". Nefertiti's parentage is not known with certainty, but one often cited theory is that she was the daughter of [[Ay]], later to be [[pharaoh]]. However, this hypothesis is likely wrong since Ay and his wife Tey are never called the father and mother of Nefertiti and [[Tey]]'s only connection with her was that she was the "nurse of the great queen" Nefertiti.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobus Van Dijk, [http://www.jacobusvandijk.nl/docs/BACE_7.pdf Horemheb and the Struggle for the Throne of Tutankhamun] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092253/http://www.jacobusvandijk.nl/docs/BACE_7.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, BACE 7 (1996), p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Nefertiti's Scenes in the tombs of the nobles in [[Amarna]] mention the queen's sister who is named [[Mutbenret]] (previously read as Mutnodjemet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Women/HOWomen/Famous/100103000000000001.htm |title=Egypt State Information Service - Famous women |date=10 April 2008 |website=Web.archive.org |accessdate=8 June 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410012045/http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Women/HOWomen/Famous/100103000000000001.htm |archivedate=April 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan.

Another theory that gained some support identified Nefertiti with the [[Mitanni]] princess [[Tadukhipa]].&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"&gt;Tyldesley, Joyce. Nefertiti: Egypt's Sun Queen. Penguin. 1998. {{ISBN|0-670-86998-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tadukhipa was already married to Akhenaten's father and there is no evidence for any reason why this woman would need to alter her name in a proposed marriage to Akhenaten or any evidence of a foreign non-Egyptian background for Nefertiti.

The exact dates when Nefertiti married Akhenaten and became the king's great royal wife of Egypt are uncertain. Their six known daughters (and estimated years of birth) were:&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"/&gt;

*[[Meritaten]]: No later than year 1, possibly later became Pharaoh Neferneferuaten.
*[[Meketaten]]: Year 4.
*[[Ankhesenamen|Ankhesenpaaten]], also known as Ankhesenamen, later queen of Tutankhamun
*[[Neferneferuaten Tasherit]]: Year 8, possibly later became Pharaoh Neferneferuaten.
*[[Neferneferure]]: Year 9.
*[[Setepenre (princess)|Setepenre]]: Year 11.

Nefertiti first appears in scenes in [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]]. In the damaged tomb ([[TT188]]) of the royal butler [[Parennefer]], the new king [[Amenhotep IV]] is accompanied by a royal woman, and this lady is thought to be an early depiction of Nefertiti. The king and queen are shown worshiping the [[Aten]]. In the tomb of the vizier [[Ramose (TT55)|Ramose]], Nefertiti is shown standing behind Amenhotep IV in the Window of Appearance during the reward ceremony for the vizier.&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"/&gt;

[[File:Nefertiti Standing-striding Berlin.jpg|thumb|210px|left|A standing/striding figure of Nefertiti made of limestone. Originally from Amarna, part of the [[Ägyptisches Museum Berlin]] collection.]]
During the early years in Thebes, [[Akhenaten]] (still known as Amenhotep IV) had several temples erected at [[Karnak]]. One of the structures, the Mansion of the Benben (hwt-ben-ben), was dedicated to Nefertiti. She is depicted with her daughter [[Meritaten]] and in some scenes the princess [[Meketaten]] participates as well. In scenes found on the [[talatat]], Nefertiti appears almost twice as often as her husband. She is shown appearing behind her husband the [[Pharaoh]] in offering scenes in the role of the queen supporting her husband, but she is also depicted in scenes that would have normally been the prerogative of the king. She is shown smiting the enemy, and captive enemies decorate her throne.&lt;ref&gt;Redford, Donald B. Akhenaten: The Heretic King. Princeton University Press. 1987. {{ISBN|978-0-691-00217-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourth year of his reign, Amenhotep IV decided to move the capital to [[Akhetaten]] (modern Amarna). In his fifth year, Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to [[Akhenaten]], and Nefertiti was henceforth known as Neferneferuaten-Nefertiti. The name change was a sign of the ever-increasing importance of the cult of the [[Aten]]. It changed Egypt's religion from a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religion to a religion which may have been better described as a [[monolatrism|monolatry]] (the depiction of a single god as an object for worship) or [[henotheism]] (one god, who is not the only god).&lt;ref&gt;[[Dominic Montserrat]], Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt, Psychology Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Boundary Stelae of Akhenaten|boundary stelae]] of years 4 and 5 mark the boundaries of the new city and suggest that the move to the new city of [[Akhetaten]] occurred around that time. The new city contained several large open-air temples dedicated to the [[Aten]]. Nefertiti and her family would have resided in the Great Royal Palace in the centre of the city and possibly at the [[Northern Palace (Amarna)|Northern Palace]] as well. Nefertiti and the rest of the royal family feature prominently in the scenes at the palaces and in the [[Tombs of the Nobles (Amarna)|tombs of the nobles]].
Nefertiti's steward during this time was an official named [[Meryre II]]. He would have been in charge of running her household.&lt;ref name="Dodson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"/&gt;
 
Inscriptions in the tombs of [[Huya (Noble)|Huya]] and [[Meryre II]] dated to Year 12, 2nd month of Peret, Day 8 show a large foreign tribute. The people of Kharu (the north) and Kush (the south) are shown bringing gifts of gold and precious items to Akhenaten and Nefertiti. In the tomb of [[Meryre II]], Nefertiti's steward, the royal couple is shown seated in a kiosk with their six daughters in attendance.&lt;ref name="Dodson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"/&gt; This is one of the last times princess [[Meketaten]] is shown alive.

Two representations of Nefertiti that were excavated by [[Flinders Petrie]] appear to show Nefertiti in the middle to later part of Akhenaten's reign 'after the exaggerated style of the early years had relaxed somewhat'.&lt;ref&gt;Trope, B., Quirke, S., Lacovara, P., Excavating Egypt. Great Discoveries from the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, 2005 {{ISBN|1-928917-06-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One is a small piece on limestone and is a preliminary sketch of Nefertiti wearing her distinctive tall crown with carving began around the mouth, chin, ear and tab of the crown. Another is a small inlay head (Petrie Museum Number UC103) modeled from reddish-brown quartzite that was clearly intended to fit into a larger composition.

Meketaten may have died in year 13 or 14. Nefertiti, Akhenaten, and three princesses are shown mourning her.&lt;ref&gt;Murnane, William J., Texts from the Amarna Period in Egypt, Society of Biblical Literature, 1995 {{ISBN|1-55540-966-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nefertiti disappears from the scene soon after that.&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"/&gt;

=== Possible reign as Pharaoh ===
{{main|Neferneferuaten}}

Many scholars believe Nefertiti had a role elevated from that of [[Great Royal Wife]], and was promoted to [[Coregency|co-regent]] by her husband Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/nefertiti|title=Nefertiti - Ancient History - HISTORY.com|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is depicted in many archaeological sites as equal in stature to a King, smiting Egypt's enemies, riding a [[chariot]], and worshipping the [[Aten]] in the manner of a [[Pharaoh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=AncientHistory|title=Nefertiti's Odyssey - National Geographic Documentary|date=2017-04-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyYurJrSiRA|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Nefertiti's name disappears from historical records, it is replaced by that of a co-regent named [[Neferneferuaten]], who became a female Pharaoh.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Gabolde|M. Gabolde]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20131012051415/http://cassian.memphis.edu/history/murnane/M_Gabolde.pdf ‘Under a Deep Blue Starry Sky’], in P. Brand (ed.), "Causing His Name to Live: Studies in Egyptian Epigraphy and History in Memory of [[William J. Murnane]].", Leiden: E. J. Brill Academic Publishers, pp. 17-21&lt;/ref&gt; It seems likely that Nefertiti, in a similar fashion to the previous female Pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]], assumed the kingship under the name Pharaoh Neferneferuaten after her husband's death. It is also possible that, in a similar fashion to Hatshepsut, Nefertiti disguised herself as a male and assumed the male alter-ego of [[Smenkhkare]]; in this instance she could have elevated her daughter [[Meritaten]] to the role of Great Royal Wife.

If Nefertiti did rule Egypt as Pharaoh, it has been theorized that she would have attempted damage control and may have re-instated the [[Ancient Egyptian religion]] and the [[Amun]] priests, and had [[Tutankhamun]] raised in with the traditional gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=AncientHistory|title='Queen Nefertiti' The Most Beautiful Face of Egypt (Discovery Channel)|date=2014-12-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kht878XLsg|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archaeology|Archaeologist]] and [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] Dr. [[Zahi Hawass]] theorized that Nefertiti returned to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] from [[Amarna]] to rule as Pharaoh, based on [[ushabti]] and other feminine evidence of a female Pharaoh found in [[KV62|Tutankhamun's tomb]], as well as evidence of Nefertiti smiting Egypt's enemies which was a duty reserved to kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Badger Utopia|title=Nefertiti - Mummy Queen of Mystery|date=2017-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czSww5m39q4|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old theories===

The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|Fragment with cartouche of Akhenaten, which is followed by epithet Great in his Lifespan and the title of Nefertiti Great King's Wife. Reign of Akhenaten. From Amarna, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]
Pre-2012 Egyptological theories thought that Nefertiti vanished from the historical record around Year 12 of Akhenaten's reign, with no word of her thereafter. Explanations included a sudden death, by a plague that was sweeping through the city, or some other natural death. This theory was based on the discovery of several [[ushabti]] fragments inscribed for Nefertiti (now located in the Louvre and Brooklyn Museums).

A previous theory, that she fell into disgrace, was discredited when deliberate erasures of monuments belonging to a queen of Akhenaten were shown to refer to [[Kiya]] instead.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;

During Akhenaten's reign (and perhaps after), Nefertiti enjoyed unprecedented power. By the twelfth year of his reign, there is evidence she may have been elevated to the status of co-regent:&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Nicholas. &lt;cite&gt;''Akhenaten: Egypt's False Prophet''&lt;/cite&gt;. p.172 Thames &amp; Hudson. 2005. {{ISBN|0-500-28552-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; equal in status to the pharaoh — as may be depicted on the [[Coregency Stela]].

It is possible Nefertiti is the ruler named [[Neferneferuaten]]. Some theories believe that Nefertiti was still alive and held influence on the younger royals. If this is the case, that influence and presumably Nefertiti's own life would have ended by year 3 of Tutankhaten's reign (1331 BC). In that year, Tutankhaten changed his name to Tutankhamun.  This is evidence of his return to the official worship of [[Amun]], and abandonment of Amarna to return the capital to Thebes.&lt;ref name="Dodson"/&gt;

===New theories===
Discovered in 2012, a Regnal Year 16, month 3 of [[Season of the Inundation|Akhet]], day 15 inscription, dated explicitly to Akhenaten's reign, mentions the presence of the "Great Royal Wife, His Beloved, Mistress of the Two Lands, Neferneferuaten Nefertiti".&lt;ref&gt;Athena Van der Perre, "Nefertiti's last documented reference (for now)", in: ''In the light of Amarna: One hundred years of the Nefertiti discovery'', edited by Frederike Seyfried.

A Contribution to the Study of the Later Years of Nefertiti, Journal of Egyptian History (JEH) 7 (2014), pp.67–108&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Perre notes that Dayr Abū Ḥinnis is located "on the eastern side of the Nile, about ten kilometers north of Amarna" and records that the building work inscription refers equally to both the ruling king Akhenaten and his great wife Nefertiti under the authority of the king's scribe [[Penthu]].&lt;ref&gt;van der Perre, JEH 7, pp. 68, 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; Penthu was presumably the owner of [[Amarna Tomb 5]]—where one of his titles given was "first servant of the Aten in the Mansion of Aten in [[Akhetaten]]"; due to the rarity of his name and his position as chief priest within the Aten priesthood, it cannot be coincidental—as van der Perre writes—that the same Penthu would have been placed in charge of quarrying stone for the Aten temple.&lt;ref&gt;van der Perre, JEH 7, pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Van der Perre stresses:&lt;ref&gt;van der Perre, JEH 7, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The importance of the inscription from Dayr Abū Ḥinnis lies in the first part of the text. This inscription offers incontrovertible evidence that both Akhenaten and Nefertiti were still alive in the 16th year of his (i.e. Akhenaten's) reign and, more importantly, that they were still holding the same positions as at the start of their reign. This makes it necessary to rethink the final years of the Amarna Period.}}

This means that Nefertiti was alive in the second to last year of Akhenaten's reign, (this pharaoh's final year was his Year 17) and demonstrates that Akhenaten still ruled alone, with his wife by his side. Therefore, the rule of the female Amarna pharaoh known as [[Neferneferuaten]] must be placed between the death of Akhenaten and the accession of [[Tutankhamun]]. This female pharaoh used the epithet 'Effective for her husband' in one of her cartouches,&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Gabolde]], "[https://web.archive.org/web/20131012051415/http://cassian.memphis.edu/history/murnane/M_Gabolde.pdf Under a Deep Blue Starry Sky]", in P. Brand (ed.), ''Causing His Name to Live: Studies in Egyptian Epigraphy and History in Memory of William J. Murnane'', pp. 17–21&lt;/ref&gt; which means she was either Nefertiti or her daughter Meritaten (who was married to king [[Smenkhkare]]).

==Burial==

The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]
There are many theories regarding Nefertiti's death and burial but, to date, the mummy of this famous queen, her parents, and her children have not been found or formally identified. In 1898, French archeologist [[Victor Loret]] found two female mummies inside the tomb of Amenhotep II in [[KV35]] in the [[Valley of the Kings]]. These two mummies, named 'The Elder Lady' and '[[The Younger Lady (mummy)|The Younger Lady]]', were likely candidates of her remains.

An article in ''[[Kmt (magazine)|KMT]]'' magazine in 2001 suggested that the Elder Lady may be Nefertiti's body.&lt;ref&gt;Susan E. James, "Who is the mummy [[The Elder Lady]]?" ''KMT,'' v.12 no.2 (Summer, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; It was argued that the evidence suggests that the mummy is around her mid-thirties or early forties, Nefertiti's guessed age of death. More evidence to support this identification was that the mummy's teeth look like that of a 29- to 38-year-old, Nefertiti's most likely age of death. Also, unfinished busts of Nefertiti appear to resemble the mummy's face, though other suggestions included [[Ankhesenamun]].

Due to recent age tests on the mummy's teeth, it eventually became apparent that the 'Elder Lady' is in fact [[Queen Tiye]], mother of [[Akhenaten]] and that the DNA of the mummy is a close, if not direct, match to the lock of hair found in Tutankhamun's tomb. The lock of hair was found in a coffinette bearing an inscription naming Queen Tiye.&lt;ref name="640-641"&gt;Hawass, Zahi et al. "Ancestry and Pathology in King Tutankhamun's Family". &lt;cite&gt;The Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/cite&gt; p.640–641&lt;/ref&gt; Results have discovered that she was the daughter of [[Yuya]] and [[Thuya]], who were the parents of [[Queen Tiye]], thus ruling her out as Nefertiti.&lt;ref name="640-641" /&gt;

In 2015, English archaeologist [[Nicholas Reeves]] announced that he had discovered evidence in high resolution scans of Tutankhamun's tomb "indications of two previously unknown doorways, one set within a larger partition wall and both seemingly untouched since antiquity&amp;nbsp;... To the north [there] appears to be signaled a continuation of tomb [[KV62]], and within these uncharted depths an earlier royal interment – that of Nefertiti herself."&lt;ref&gt;[https://uk.news.yahoo.com/archaeologist-believes-hidden-passageway-tomb-113904751.html#ChEDso2 "Archaeologist believes hidden passageway in tomb of Tutankhamun leads to resting place of Nefertiti"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118161433/https://uk.news.yahoo.com/archaeologist-believes-hidden-passageway-tomb-113904751.html |date=2015-11-18 }}.

==="Younger Lady"===
{{Main article|The Younger Lady}}

On June 9, 2003, archaeologist [[Joann Fletcher]], a specialist in ancient hair from the [[University of York]] in England, announced that Nefertiti's mummy may have been the Younger Lady. Fletcher suggested that Nefertiti was the Pharaoh Smenkhkare. Some Egyptologists hold to this view though the majority believe Smenkhkare to have been a separate person. Fletcher led an expedition funded by the [[Discovery Channel]] to examine what they believed to have been Nefertiti's mummy.  However, it is well known that an independent researcher, Marianne Luban, was the first person to suggest that the KV35 Young Lady could be Nefertiti in an online article, "Do We Have the Mummy of Nefertiti?" published in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Luban, Marianne, "My Quest For Nefertiti" [2015]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The team claimed that the mummy they examined was damaged in a way suggesting the body had been deliberately desecrated in antiquity. Mummification techniques, such as the use of embalming fluid and the presence of an intact [[brain]], suggested an eighteenth-dynasty royal mummy. Other elements which the team used to support their theory were the age of the body, the presence of embedded nefer beads, and a wig of a rare style worn by Nefertiti. They further claimed that the mummy's arm was originally bent in the position reserved for pharaohs, but was later snapped off and replaced with another arm in a normal position.

Most Egyptologists, among them [[Kent Weeks]] and [[Peter Lacovara]], generally dismiss Fletcher's claims as unsubstantiated. They say that ancient mummies are almost impossible to identify as a particular person without [[List of DNA tested mummies|DNA]]. As bodies of Nefertiti's parents or children have never been identified, her conclusive identification is impossible. Any circumstantial evidence, such as hairstyle and arm position, is not reliable enough to pinpoint a single, specific historical person. The cause of damage to the mummy can only be speculated upon, and the alleged revenge is an unsubstantiated theory. Bent arms, contrary to Fletcher's claims, were not reserved to pharaohs; this was also used for other members of the royal family. The wig found near the mummy is of unknown origin, and cannot be conclusively linked to that specific body. Finally, the 18th dynasty was one of the largest and most prosperous dynasties of ancient Egypt. A female royal mummy could be any of a hundred royal wives or daughters from the 18th dynasty's more than 200 years on the throne.

In addition to that, there was controversy about both the age and sex of the mummy. On June 12, 2003, Egyptian archaeologist Dr. [[Zahi Hawass]], head of Egypt's [[Supreme Council for Antiquities]], also dismissed the claim, citing insufficient evidence. On August 30, 2003, [[Reuters]] further quoted Hawass: "I'm sure that this mummy is not a female", and "Dr Fletcher has broken the rules and therefore, at least until we have reviewed the situation with her university, she must be banned from working in Egypt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zahihawass.com/wc_no_discrimination.htm |title=Weekly Column - Dr. Zahi Hawass |date=27 September 2007 |website=Web.archive.org |accessdate=8 June 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927131223/http://www.zahihawass.com/wc_no_discrimination.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On different occasions, Hawass has claimed that the mummy is female and male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article521971.ece|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|website=Timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=8 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202014931/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article521971.ece|archivedate=2 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more recent research effort led by Hawass, the mummy was put through [[computed tomography|CT]] scan analysis. Researchers concluded that she may be Tutankhamun's biological mother, an unnamed daughter of [[Amenhotep III]] and [[Queen Tiye]], not Nefertiti. Fragments of shattered bone were found in the sinus, and blood clots were found. The theory that the damage was inflicted post-mummification was rejected, and a murder scenario was deemed more likely. The broken-off bent forearm found near the mummy, which had been proposed to have belonged to it, was conclusively shown not to actually belong to the Younger Lady. Scholars think that, after Tutankhamun returned Egypt to the traditional religion, he moved his closest relatives – father, grandmother, and biological mother – to the Valley of the Kings to be buried with him (according to the list of figurines and drawings in [[KV62|his tomb]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Hittite letters==
A document was found in the ancient Hittite capital of [[Hattusa]] which dates to the Amarna period; the so-called "Deeds" of [[Suppiluliuma I]]. The Hittite ruler receives a letter from the Egyptian queen, while being in siege on [[Karkemish]]. The letter reads:&lt;ref name="manley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suziemanley.com/famous_egyptians/ankhesenamen.htm|title=Ankhesenamun - Queen of Tutankhamun and Daughter of Akhenaten|author=Manley, Suzie |work=Egypt * Pyramids * History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|My husband has died and I have no son. They say about you that you have many sons. You might give me one of your sons to become my husband. I would not wish to take one of my subjects as a husband... I am afraid.}}

This document is considered extraordinary, as Egyptians traditionally considered foreigners to be inferior. Suppiluliuma I was surprised and exclaimed to his courtiers:&lt;ref name="deeds"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Deeds of Suppiluliuma as Told by His Son, Mursili II |jstor=1359041 |journal=Journal of Cuneiform Studies |volume=10 |issue=2 |year=1956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Nothing like this has happened to me in my entire life!}}

Understandably, he was wary, and had an envoy investigate the situation, but by so doing, he missed his chance to bring Egypt into his empire. He eventually did send one of his sons, [[Zannanza]], but the prince died, perhaps murdered, en route.&lt;ref name="kuhrt252"&gt;{{cite book|pages=254|author=Amelie Kuhrt|title=The Ancient Middle East c. 3000 &amp;ndash; 330 BC|volume=1|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of the queen who wrote the letter is uncertain. She is called [[Dakhamunzu]] in the Hittite annals, a possible translation of the Egyptian title ''Tahemetnesu'' (The King's Wife).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Towards an Absolute Chronology for Ancient Egypt|pages=5|author=William McMurray|format=pdf|url=http://www.egiptomania.com/EEF/ACAE1.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184605/http://www.egiptomania.com/EEF/ACAE1.pdf|archivedate=2007-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible candidates are Nefertiti, [[Meritaten]],&lt;ref name="Grajetzki64"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Egyptian Queens; a hieroglyphic dictionary|first=Wolfram|last=Grajetzki|year=2000|location=London|publisher=Golden House|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ankhesenamun]]. Ankhesenamun once seemed likely since there were no candidates for the throne on the death of her husband, Tutankhamun, whereas Akhenaten had at least two legitimate successors.&lt;ref name="manley"/&gt; but this was based on a 27-year reign for the last 18th dynasty pharaoh [[Horemheb]] who is now accepted to have had a shorter reign of only 14 years. This makes the deceased Egyptian king appear to be Akhenaten instead rather than Tutankhamun. Furthermore, the phrase regarding marriage to 'one of my subjects' (translated by some as 'servants') is possibly either a reference to the Grand Vizier [[Ay]] or a secondary member of the Egyptian royal family line. Since Nefertiti was depicted as powerful as her husband in official monuments smiting Egypt's enemies, she might be the [[Dakhamunzu]] in the Amarna correspondence as Nicholas Reeves believes.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Reeves,[https://www.academia.edu/7415055/Tutankhamuns_Mask_Reconsidered_in_press_corrected_proof_2015_ Tutankhamun's Mask Reconsidered] BES 19 (2014), pp.523&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Andrew Kwasniewski''' (born 22 March 1971) is a traditionalist Catholic writer and composer of sacred music. He is a Senior Fellow of the St. Paul Center in Steubenville, Ohio, and was formerly on the faculty of [[Wyoming Catholic College]]. He is also the author of three books about traditional Catholicism: ''Resurgent in the Midst of Crisis''; ''Noble Beauty, Transcendent Holiness''; and ''Tradition and Sanity''.

==Career==

Kwasniewski was born 22 March 1971 in Arlington Heights, Illinois. He grew up in New Jersey. At the Delbarton School in Morristown, he received his first serious tutelage in music. After a year at Georgetown University, Kwasniewski matriculated as a freshman at [[Thomas Aquinas College]] in California, where he earned a B.A. in Liberal Arts in 1994. He subsequently studied at [[Catholic University of America|The Catholic University of America,]] focusing on ancient Greek philosophy and medieval scholasticism. He received his M.A. in Philosophy in 1996, writing a thesis on ''The Dialectic of Reason and Faith in Descartes’s “Meditationes de prima philosophia,”'' and his Ph.D. in the same discipline in 2002, with a dissertation on ''The Ecstasy of Love in Thomas Aquinas.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Kwasniewski|first=Peter Andrew|title=The Ecstasy of Love in Thomas Aquinas|date=2002|degree=PhD Thesis|publisher=The Catholic University of America|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/KWATEO-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as Assistant Professor of Philosophy from 1998 to 2006 at the [[International Theological Institute|International Theological Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family]] in Austria (then in the town of Gaming) and as an adjunct instructor in music appreciation at the [[Franciscan University of Steubenville|Franciscan University of Steubenville’s]] Austria Program located on the same campus. In the summer of 2006, he joined the founding team of [[Wyoming Catholic College]] in Lander, Wyoming, where he served as Assistant Academic Dean and Director of Admissions, and then as Choirmaster and Professor of Theology and Philosophy. He also taught music and art history in the College’s fine arts curriculum.

At the end of the academic year of 2017–18, Kwasniewski left Wyoming Catholic College. He accepted the title of Senior Fellow of the St. Paul Center in Steubenville, Ohio, and is currently working as an independent writer, editor, publisher, and guest lecturer, giving talks and workshops on the traditional liturgy of the Catholic Church.

Kwasniewski is a board member and scholar of The Aquinas Institute in Green Bay, Wisconsin, which is publishing the ''Opera Omnia'' of the Angelic Doctor, and a Fellow of the Albertus Magnus Center for Scholastic Studies.

==Public reception==

Kwasniewski's books, lectures, and articles have meet with both considerable praise and opposition. Major prelates and Catholic magazines and websites have praised Kwasniewski for his insights into the crisis in the Church, while others have criticized him for insubordination to the present wishes of Church leaders. Some, like Fr. Anthony Ruff, OSB, of the PrayTell blog, have criticized Kwasniewski for an intransigent defense of traditional things, especially preconciliar, and for his apparent rejection of the reforms intended by the Second Vatican Council. Ruff, in particular, argues that Kwasniewski depends excessively on the Council of Trent, whose doctrine was completed and corrected by Vatican II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.praytellblog.com/index.php/2017/10/10/the-priority-of-religion-and-adoration-peter-kwasniewski-on-the-eucharist/|title=The Priority of Religion and Adoration? Peter Kwasniewski on the Eucharist|work=PrayTellBlog|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Daly maintains that Kwasniewski's vocal preference for traditional worship is itself characteristically modern because it is a lifestyle and worldview choice over against other options that have more to recommend them, such as the contemporary [[magisterium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.praytellblog.com/index.php/2017/07/09/follow-up-is-summorum-pontificum-divisive/|title=Follow-up: Is ''Summorum Pontificum'' Divisive?|work=PrayTellBlog|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for Kwasniewski's positions and writings has also been substantial. In 2016, the international Catholic TV station [[EWTN]] broadcast a TV interview with Kwasniewski on their popular "EWTN Live" channel&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=EWTN|title=EWTN Live - 2017-06-14 - Peter Kwasniewski Phd|date=2017-06-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR2PZjLauxc|accessdate=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also began carrying his book ''Resurgent in the Midst of Crisis'' in their online catalog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ewtnreligiouscatalogue.com/Home+Page/BOOKS/Mass+Eucharist/RESURGENT+IN+THE+MIDST+OF+CRISIS.axd|title=RESURGENT IN THE MIDST OF CRISIS|website=www.ewtnreligiouscatalogue.com|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, TV Infobar made available the video of the book launch of the Czech translation of ''Resurgent,'' at which [[Raymond Leo Burke|Cardinal Burke]] introduced the book, calling it "very readable and very accessible" and thanking Kwasniewski "for giving us this work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TV Infobar|title=Peter Kwasniewski: Povstávání z prachu - Tradiční liturgie a obnova Církve|date=2016-11-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYC-LIHQOKg|accessdate=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other positive publicity for this book included ''The [[New Oxford Review]]'', which claims that "Kwasniewski accurately sums up the current situation in the Church" and that ''Resurgent'' is "a starting point for serious discussion" for "revitalizing the Church".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newoxfordreview.org/reviews.jsp?did=0615-storck|title=New Oxford Review|website=www.newoxfordreview.org|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His book, ''Noble Beauty, Transcendent Holiness,'' was praised by ''[[The Catholic Herald]]'', a major British newspaper, and ''[[National Review]]'', both of which published favorable reviews of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/magazine-post/our-ill-starred-love-affair-with-modernity/|title=Our ill-starred love affair with modernity {{!}} CatholicHerald.co.uk|date=2017-11-23|work=CatholicHerald.co.uk|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/09/traditional-latin-mass-catholic-liturgy-peter-kwasniewski-noble-beauty-transcendent-holiness-pope-benedict-xvi-summorum-pontificum/|title=Beautiful and Holy: The Case for the Traditional Latin Mass {{!}} National Review|date=2017-09-16|work=National Review|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Zuhlsdorf|Fr. Zuhlsdorf]] also reviewed the book favorably, claiming that "He writes with clarity and great force, which surely reflect both his deft mind and his convictions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wdtprs.com/blog/2017/07/review-peter-kwasniewskis-new-book-noble-beauty-transcendent-holiness-why-the-modern-age-needs-the-mass-of-ages/|title=REVIEW – Peter Kwasniewski’s new book: Noble Beauty, Transcendent Holiness: Why the Modern Age Needs the Mass of Ages {{!}} Fr.

In 2016, it was revealed that Kwasniewski was among the clergy and theologians who signed the "Letter of the 45", a letter to all the Catholic Cardinals which asked them to "respond to the dangers to Catholic faith and morals" that Pope Francis' ''Amoris Laetitia'' posed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/signers-document-critiquing-amoris-laetitia-revealed|title=Signers of document critiquing 'Amoris Laetitia' revealed|date=2016-07-22|work=National Catholic Reporter|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kwasniewski was also a signatory of a Letter in support of the Four Dubia Cardinals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/2016/12/letter-in-support-of-four-cardinals.html|title=RORATE CÆLI: Letter in support of the Four Cardinals from Catholic academics and pastors|last=Shaw|first=Joseph|website=RORATE CÆLI|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

In addition to being a teacher and writer, Kwasniewski has enjoyed a parallel career as a choirmaster, cantor, and composer of about 150 works of music.

After studying composition and conducting with Roy Horton and voice with Carol Horton at Delbarton School in Morristown, New Jersey, Kwasniewski became assistant choir director at Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula, California (1990–1994). He served as director of the Schola Cantorum at Old St. John’s Catholic Church in Silver Spring, Maryland (1994–1998), director of music at the International Theological Institute in Gaming, Austria (1999–2006), and founding choirmaster and schola director at Wyoming Catholic College (2007–2018).

Kwasniewski’s Mass settings, motets, hymns, carols, antiphons, and acclamations have received numerous performances from 1990 to the present. His Mass settings include ''Missa Spiritus Domini'' (1994), ''Missa Spe Salvi'' (1995, rev. 2012), ''Missa Brevis'' à 3 (1997), ''Missa Hereditas Mihi'' à 3 (2016), and ''Missa Honorificentia Populi Nostri'' (2017). His ''Seven Mandatum Antiphons'' (2010) were dedicated to Arvo Pärt on the occasion of his 75th birthday; the maestro personally accepted the dedication. Many of these works can be found in his book ''Sacred Choral Works,'' which was highly acclaimed when it first appeared in 2014. Ensembles that have performed Kwasniewski's choral music include the Ecclesia Choir (dir. Timothy Woods), the Vittoria Ensemble (dir. Rick Wheeler), the Scottish ensemble ''Cantiones Sacrae'' (dir. Graeme Adamson), and Cantus Magnus (dir. Matthew Schellhorn).

Kwasniewski has also written a three-movement wind quintet ''Fire and Flame,'' premiered by the Antero Winds in 2012; an ''Ave Maria'' for SATB, winds, and strings; a violin sonata; organ accompaniments for English plainchant; and pieces for brass quartet and string quartet.

He has published numerous articles on music, especially on the recovery and renewal of sacred music in the contemporary Church.

The '''Ramdasia''' are a [[Sikh]] sub-group that has originated from the Hindu [[Caste system in India|caste]] of [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]]s known as [[Julaha]].&lt;ref name="Singha"/&gt; According to Paul Ghuman, Ramdasias are also [[Chamar]]s who have converted to Sikhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghuman|first=Paul|title=British Untouchables A Study of Dalit Identity and Education|year=May 2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Limited|isbn=075464877X|page=iX|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQZcI3FCxlEC&amp;pg=PR9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

H. S. Singha says that "Ramdasia is a term used in general for Sikhs whose ancestors belonged to backward classes. Originally it meant the descendants and followers of Ramdas who belonged to the weaver (Julaha) community".&lt;ref name="Singha"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism |publisher=Hemkunt Press |first=H. S. |last=Singha  |year=2009 |location=India |page=171 |isbn=8170103010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julaha Sikhs are also known as the Khalsa biradar (brother of the Khalsa).&lt;ref name="kalsi"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Evolution of a Sikh Community in Britain. Religious and Social Change among the Sikhs of Leeds and Bradford. |publisher=Leeds University Community Religions Project |last=Kalsi |first= Sewa Singh |year=May 1992 |location=England |page=99 |isbn=1871363039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ramdasia Chamars==

Gerald Parsons says that "[[Ravidasia|Ravidasis]] are to be distinguished from the Ramdasias who also belonged to the Chamar caste in Punjab but who were converted to the Sikh community, according to tradition, during the guruship of Ram Das".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parsons|first=Gerald|title=The Growth of Religious Diversity - Vol 1: Britain from 1945 Volume 1: Traditions|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415083265|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalsi notes that some Chamar's claim to have been Julahas but then reverted to be Chamar. "We are all Chamars (landless labourers and leather workers) - some families chose to take up weaving, they were known as Julahas. My ancestors were weavers, but they reverted to shoe-making during the war. We have common ''gots'' and our houses are located on one side of the villages."&lt;ref name="kalsi1989"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/517/1/uk_bl_ethos_328858.pdf |title=THE SIKHS AND CASTE A Study of the Sikh Community in Leeds and Bradford.  |publisher=Leeds University Community Religions Project |last=Kalsi |first=Sewa Singh |year=May 1989 |location=England |pages=171-172 |isbn=1871363039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He further notes that Julaha social status is higher than that of Chamars and that Julahas do not marry outside of their endogamous group.&lt;ref name="kalsi1989"/&gt;

==Caste status==

Ramdasia's are a [[Scheduled Caste]]&lt;ref&gt;http://socialjustice.nic.in/scorder1950.php?pageid=11&lt;/ref&gt; and prefer to be called Sikh only.&lt;ref name="kalsi1989"/&gt;

==Other uses==

The word Ramdasia, has also been associated with masands or preachers that were appointed by the Sikh [[Guru Ram Das]].&lt;ref name="Gandhi"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/History-Sikh-Gurus-Retold--1606/dp/8126908572/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1364375290&amp;sr=1-1 |title=History of Sikh Gurus Retold: 1469 -1606 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors Pvt Ltd |last=Gandhi |first=Surjit Singh |year=2008 |location=England |page=331 |isbn=8126908572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Peters met American comedian [[George Carlin]], one of his biggest influences, who advised him to get on stage whenever and wherever possible. Peters said he "took that advice to heart, and I think that's the reason I am where I am now."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russellpeters.com/Press/Russell-Peters---10-Comics-to-Watch_4 Russell Peters - 10 Comics to Watch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403034823/http://russellpeters.com/Press/Russell-Peters---10-Comics-to-Watch_4 |date=2013-04-03 }} RussellPeters.com.

Peters credits his 2004 performance on the Canadian TV comedy show ''[[Comedy Now!]]'', which was uploaded onto [[YouTube]] and became [[viral video|viral]], as the turning point in his career. While the initial video upload featured his entire 45-minute performance, YouTube users subsequently uploaded segments of the performance in which Peters focused on individual cultural groups. According to Peters, those segments made their way to the "targeted" cultural groups and were well received by them. The video and its viral nature was referred to by Peters on his performance, ''Outsourced''; when the audience cheered when he referred to earlier jokes, he exclaimed, "Look at you, you filthy downloaders!"&lt;ref name="Russell Peters: Outsourced Aired on COMEDYP&amp;nbsp;— Ark TV Transcript"&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Peters: Outsourced Aired on COMEDYP&amp;nbsp;— Ark TV Transcript|url=http://tv.ark.com/transcript/russell_peters__outsourced/6732/COMEDYP/Saturday_December_19_2009/140807/|website=tv.ark.com|accessdate=1 September 2015|ref=Russell Peters: Outsourced Aired on COMEDYP&amp;nbsp;— Ark TV Transcript|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111234057/http://tv.ark.com/transcript/russell_peters__outsourced/6732/COMEDYP/Saturday_December_19_2009/140807/|archive-date=11 January 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedic style==
Peters's stand-up performances feature [[observational comedy]], using humour to highlight racial, ethnic, class and cultural stereotypes. He often refers to his own experiences growing up in an Anglo-Indian family, and impersonates the accents of various ethnic groups to poke fun at them. As he told an audience in San Francisco, "I don't make the stereotypes, I just see them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Piccalo|first=Gina|title=No joke&amp;nbsp;— Russell Peters is a famous comedian|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/16/entertainment/la-et--russell-peters-20100416|accessdate=29 January 2012|newspaper=LA Times|date=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 interview with ''[[The National (CBC)|The National]],'' Peters observed that he did not intend to put down or offend different races and cultures, but tried to "raise them up through humour".&lt;ref&gt;Clifton Joseph, "Russell Peters Interview on CBC The National, May 30th 2006"&lt;/ref&gt;

Peters is widely known for his punchline, "Somebody gonna get a hurt real bad." It ends a joke he tells about his childhood with a traditional Indian father, who used corporal punishment on his sons. Another punchline he uses is "Be a man! Do the right thing!", which relates to a story of a Chinese man trying to get him to pay more for an item at a shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nguyen|first=An|title=Defying Stereotypes and Breaking All Laws of Decency, Russell Peters Lets It All Hang Out|url=http://culturemagazine.ca/culture/defying_stereotypes_and_breaking_all_laws_of_decency_russell_peters_lets_it_all_hang_out.html|accessdate=29 January 2012|newspaper=(Cult)ure magazine|date=19 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115223351/http://culturemagazine.ca/culture/defying_stereotypes_and_breaking_all_laws_of_decency_russell_peters_lets_it_all_hang_out.html|archivedate=15 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When interviewer [[Larry King]] asked Peters, "Is there such a thing as too taboo?", Peters replied, "I don't talk about religion because I think people are a little weird about religion, especially nowadays, and I'm more of a science guy than I am a beliefs guy. I'm more into facts than I am into beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;''Larry King Now'',  Ora TV https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kunZO5i2JnA (1:30)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ora.tv/larrykingnow/2014/8/6/lknpetersrussell004-0_5yhqhlfpfu7y|title=Russell Peters: I Don’t Talk About Religion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview with ''Al Jazeera'', Peters said he "refuses" to talk about religion.&lt;ref&gt;''Al Jazeera'' English: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKXxiccJx9c (3:30)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/17/russell-peters-avoids-religion-in-his-comedy-act/|title=Russell Peters avoids religion in his comedy act|first=The Washington Times|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Satya Yuga''' ([[Sanskrit]]: सत्य युग), also called '''Satyug''', or '''Kṛta Yuga''' ([[Sanskrit]]: कृत युग) in [[Hinduism]], is the first of the four [[Yuga]]s, the "''Yuga'' (Age or Era) of Truth", when humanity is governed by [[deity|gods]], and every manifestation or work is close to the purest ideal and humanity will allow intrinsic goodness to rule supreme. It is sometimes referred to as the "[[Golden Age]]". The Satya Yuga lasts 1,728,000 years.  The goddess [[Dharma]] (depicted in the form of a cow), which symbolises morality, stood on all four legs during this period. Later on in the Treta Yuga, it would become three, followed by two in the Dvapara Yuga. Currently, in the immoral age of [[Kaliyuga|Kali]], it stands on one leg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduism.co.za/kaliyuga.htm Kali Yuga]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The cycle ==
The Yugas are said to succeed each other almost endlessly. After the perfect Satya Yuga, a decline marks the ''[[Treta Yuga]]''. Further decline brings about the ''[[Dwapara Yuga]]'', and after it comes the final and dark ''[[Kali Yuga]]'', a time of wickedness, when man kills another man. At the end of the cycle [[Kalki]] is said to take birth and reestablish righteousness, thus beginning a new Satya Yuga.

== The Satya Yuga according to some holy texts==

...as described in the '''[[Mahabharata]]''', a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Epic poetry|epic]]:

{{cquote| there were no poor and no rich; there was no need to labour, because all that men required was obtained by the power of will; the chief virtue was the abandonment of all worldly desires. The ''Krita Yuga'' was without disease; there was no lessening with the years; there was no hatred or vanity, or evil thought; no sorrow, no fear. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness.}}

==Brief Explanation== 

Amongst the four eras, the '''[[Satya Yuga]]''' is the first and the most significant one. Knowledge, meditation, and penance hold special importance in this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Raghunath Ghosh|title=Humanity, Truth, and Freedom: Essays in Modern Indian |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=YMlyid2aksEC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=satya+yuga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1-8avycPVAhWKQ48KHVvzAdYQ6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=satya%20yuga&amp;f=false |year=2008|publisher=Northern Book |isbn=978-81-7211-233-2|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the pillars of [[Dharma]] are present in totality. During Satya Yuga, all people engage only in good, sublime deeds. [[Ashrams]] become devoid of wickedness and deceit. [[Natya]]m (such as [[Bharatanatyam]]), according to [[Natya Shastra]], did not exist in the Satya Yuga "because it was the time when all people were happy". 
This [[Yuga]] extends up to 1,728,000 years. Lord [[Vishnu]] incarnated in four forms i.e. '''Matsya, Kurma, Varaha and Narsimha''' in this era.The only text which was considered credible and was followed was Manu’s [[Dharma Shastra]]. The average life expectancy of a human being in Satya Yuga was approximately 4000 years.

The '''[[Vaishya]]''' (traders) of this era shall engage in trade and business very justly and honestly. '''[[Brahmins]]''' shall be engaged continually in religious sacrifices, study, teaching, charity etc. The '''[[Kshatriya]]''' (warriors) shall be inclined towards the exhibition of valiance and might. The '''[[Shudras]]''' shall sincerely serve the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. This form of religion shall remain intact and absolute in the Satya Yuga.

One shall witness the total establishment of [[Sanātana Dharma|Sanatan Dharma]] (eternal religion). All the [[Deity|deities]], [[Demon|demons]], [[Gandharva|Gandharvas]], and [[Yaksha]] would give up their hatred and differences. The Rik, Sama and [[Yajurveda]] were not separate and demarcated. This era was devoid of agricultural activities or any other type of activity. Just by mere contemplation one would beget desired results. People in this era would never fall ill. No one would try to point out faults or demerits in anyone’s personality. The personality was not plagued by demerits like ego, sorrow, violent thought (aggression), jealousy, hatred, backbiting, fear, anger and lethargy.

At that time, the colour of the Supreme cosmic soul that was situated in the heart of one and all and the saviour of all the sages was white.

All the people that are [[Brahmins]], [[Kshatriyas]], [[Vaishyas]] and [[Shudras]] were embellished with all the good qualities. People would practice austerities and penance to attain [[Brahman]]. All would be inclined towards the supreme knowledge and all actions performed would be in the intention of attaining celestial bliss.

In this way all these divine people would be bestowed with sublime faith and piousness. Albeit, people were segregated on the basis of the [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varnashram]] method, they would all response their faith in the [[Vedas]] and the Sanatan Dharma because these people were devoid of selfishness, and they would effortlessly attain sublimity or union with God, which is a salient feature of Satya Yuga. Very valiant, mighty, intelligent and people gifted with all good qualities would be born in this era. They would surprisingly give birth to thousands of children. Great sages embellished with divinity would be born in this era.

==End of Kali Yuga and starting of Satya Yuga==

The tenth avatar of the Lord [[Vishnu]] in the current Mahayuga is foretold to appear at the end of Kali Yuga, the current epoch. The Purana scriptures foretell that [[Kalki]] will be atop a white horse with a drawn blazing sword. He is the harbinger of the end time in Hindu eschatology, after which he will usher in Satya Yuga.

===Astrology===
Kalki can only be the one whose Birthday/Tithi falls on Dvadasi of Sukla Paksha. This amounts to just 12 days per any given year; furthermore, as it can only be the day of the Lord Sri Maha Vishnu (Chaitra Dwadashi), this amounts to just one day each year or 100 days in the last century.

Indian astrologers have analysed Puranas extensively to try to foretell the time of Kalki's birth. The signs described in the Kalki Purana are as follows:
# The moon will be in Dhanishtha nakshatra, Aquarius, suggesting he will be wealthy, acclaimed and swift in action and thought.
# The sun will be in Swati, the nakshatra of the sword.
# Jupiter will be in Purva Ashadha nakshatra, [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]].
# The Ascendant Lord will be in Purva Ashadha nakshatra, also Sagittarius, suggesting invincibility and early victory.
# Saturn will be exalted in [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], predicting a balance between justice and the sword.
# [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]], a five-headed snake god in navagraha, will be exalted in Scorpio, suggesting he will descend atop a great white steed.

The [[Puranas]] describe the date as twenty-one fortnights from the birth of Krishna, which itself falls on Janmashtami in August. This would put his descent at [[Vaishakha]], between April and May. At this time, the father of Kalki is foretold to be overwhelmed by the incarnation of Godhead that he sees as his son. This places Kalki under the sun sign of [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] or [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]].

The Bhavishya Purana foretells:

{{quote|
The Savior of the entire universe, Maha Vishnu&lt;br /&gt;
will be born on Margashirsha Month, Krishna Ashtami&lt;br /&gt;
8th day after the full-moon day.
|Bhavishya Purana, Canto IV, Chapter 23, Text 15}}

There have been a range of dates predicted, purportedly from different methods of calculation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kalagnanam.in/date-of-kalki-avatar-birth/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandra"&gt;{{cite book|last = Chandra| first = Suresh| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses | publisher = Kindle Edition| date = Aug 15, 2012| location = | pages = | url =   | doi = | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sri [[Potuluri Virabrahmendra Swami]], for example, wrote 400 years ago in his ''Divya Maha Kalagnanam,''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kalagnanam.in/&lt;/ref&gt; or 'Divine Knowledge of the Time,' that Kalki would arrive when the moon, sun, Venus and Jupiter entered the same sign.

Tomb '''TT188''', located in the [[necropolis]] of [[El-Khokha]] in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in [[Egypt]], is the tomb of the Steward and King's Cupbearer [[Parennefer]].&lt;ref name="Aldred"&gt;Aldred, Cyril, Akhenaten: King of Egypt ,Thames and Hudson, 1991 (paperback), pp 91-92, {{ISBN|0-500-27621-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Bertha and Moss, Rosalind, Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Statues, Reliefs and Paintings Volume I: The Theban Necropolis, Part I. Private Tombs, Griffith Institute. 1970, pp 293-295 ASIN: B002WL4ON4&lt;/ref&gt; It has been excavated by the [[Akhenaten Temple Project]].

It is one of the few tombs in the [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] necropolis that was carved and decorated solely during the early years of the rule of [[Akhenaten]].&lt;ref name="Murnane"&gt;Murnane, William J., Texts from the Amarna Period in Egypt, Society of Biblical Literature, 1995 pp 64-66, {{ISBN|1-55540-966-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb is decorated with sculpted scenes, some of which were painted. The scenes were all badly damaged and the name of Parennefer was carefully removed. The decoration includes harvest scenes, the presentation of temple-staves at the inauguration of Akhenaten, and an award scene showing Parennefer before the royal couple. In the tomb Akhenaten goes by his initial name Amenhotep (IV).&lt;ref name="Aldred"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. de G. Davies, Akhenaten at Thebes, The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. 9, No. 3/4 (Oct., 1923), pp. 132-152, Egypt Exploration Society, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3854031 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The scenes in the tomb may be the first to show Queen [[Nefertiti]]. An unnamed royal woman accompanies Akhenaten as he worships the [[Aten]] and sits besides the king in a scene showiwing Parennefer before his king and queen. The queen is thought to be Nefertiti.&lt;ref&gt;Tyldesley, Joyce. Nefertiti: Egypt's Sun Queen. Penguin. 1998. p 50 {{ISBN|0-670-86998-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scenes in the tomb of Parennefer show some of the earliest examples of Amarna style depictions. The figures show the rounded form that will become typical in Amarna art, and courtiers are shown bending from the waist with their arms hanging down.&lt;ref&gt;Charles F. Nims, The Transition from the Traditional to the New Style of Wall Relief under Amenhotep IV, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 32, No. 1/2 (Jan. - Apr., 1973), pp. 181-187, The University of Chicago Press,  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/543483 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mummies, coffins and other remains show that the tomb was later reused during the [[Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt|21st]] and [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|22nd]] dynasties, and robber tunnels have led the way to new and unrecorded tombs, whose entrances cannot be located from outside. {{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Recent Discoveries==
By tracing the multiple robber tunnels that enter the tomb, other previously unknown tombs have been located close by. These include a small painted tomb from the [[Ramesside]] period, one from the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]], and a tomb of the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|25th Dynasty]]. This last tomb entrance way is constructed of mud-brick, has a large open court, and a long corridor with a series of chambers and deep shafts excavated in the bedrock. {{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Other Tomb==
Parennefer also had a [[Amarna Tomb 7|tomb (no 7)]] constructed at [[Amarna]].&lt;ref&gt;N. de G. Davies, The rock tombs of El-Amarna, Parts V and VI, 1905 (Reprinted 2004), The Egypt Exploration Society, {{ISBN|0-85698-161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tarakeswar affair''' (also known as the '''Tarakeswar scandal''' or the '''Mahant-Elokeshi affair''') refers to a public scandal in 19th-century [[Bengal]] during the [[British Raj]]. It resulted from an illicit love affair between Elokeshi, the wife of a government employee Nobin Chandra, and the [[Brahmin]] head priest (or ''[[mahant]]'') of the [[Tarakeswar]] [[Taraknath Temple|Shiva temple]].&lt;ref name="V&amp;A"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O71394/painting-the-mahant-arrives-in-jail/|title=The Mahant arrives in jail; Tarakeshwar affair|work=Official site of Museum|publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyay"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chattopadhyay|first=Swati|title=Representing Calcutta: modernity, nationalism, and the colonial uncanny|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|pages=229–237|chapter=Representing sexual transgression|isbn=0-415-34359-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobin subsequently [[decapitated]] his wife Elokeshi because of the love affair. A highly publicised trial followed, dubbed the '''Tarakeswar murder case''' of 1873, in which both the husband and the ''mahant'' were found guilty in varying degrees.&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyay"/&gt;

Bengali society considered the ''mahant''{{'}}s actions as punishable and criminal, while justifying Nobin's action of killing an unchaste wife. The resulting public outrage forced authorities to release Nobin after two years.&lt;ref name="V&amp;A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="movinghere"/&gt; The scandal became the subject of [[Kalighat painting]]s and several popular [[Bengali language|Bengali]] plays, which often portrayed Nobin as a devoted husband. The ''mahant'' was generally presented as a womaniser, who took advantage of young women. The murder victim Elokeshi was sometimes blamed as a seductress and the root cause of the affair. In other plays, she was absolved of all guilt and was portrayed to have been tricked and raped by the ''mahant''. 

==Summary==
[[File:Trial of Tarakeswar scandal.jpg|thumb|The trial of the Tarakeswar scandal. Clockwise from left top: the court clerk, British judge, lawyer, the ''mahant'' in the witness box, Nabin with ''havildar'' (policeman). Elokeshi's corpse and the murder weapon in the centre.]]
Elokeshi, the sixteen-year-old housewife of the [[Bengali people|Bengali]] government employee Nobin Chandra (Nobinchandra/Nabinchandra/Nobin Chandra) Banerjee, lived in the village of Tarakeswar with her parents, while Nobin was away for work in a military press in Calcutta.&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sarkar1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarkar|first=Tanika |title=Hindu wife, Hindu nation|publisher=Permanent Black|year=2005|pages=56–62|chapter=Talking about scandals|isbn=81-7824-067-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She approached Madhavchandra Giri, the "powerful" ''mahant'' of the popular and prosperous Tarakeswar temple,&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt; seeking fertility medication; however the ''mahant'' allegedly seduced and raped her.&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyay"/&gt; An affair began with the "connivance" of Elokeshi's parents.&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt;

When Nobin returned to the village, he learned about the affair from village gossip. Nobin was publicly humiliated following the discovery of the affair.&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="movinghere"/&gt; He confronted Elokeshi, who confessed and begged him for forgiveness. Not only did Nobin forgive her but he decided to run away with her from Tarakeswar. However, the ''mahant'' did not allow the couple to escape; his goons blocked their way.&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt; Overcome with anger and jealousy, Nobin slit his wife's throat with a fish knife, decapitating her,&lt;ref name="movinghere"/&gt; on 27 May 1873.&lt;ref name="V&amp;A"/&gt; Full of remorse, Nobin surrendered to the local police station and confessed his crime.&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt;

The ''Tarakeswar murder case of 1873'' (Queen ''vs'' Nobin Chandra Banerjee)&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt; first stood in the Hoogly Sessions Court at [[Serampore]] in south-west [[Bengal]]. The Indian jury acquitted Nobin, accepting his plea of insanity, but the British judge Field overruled the jury's decision and forwarded the matter to the [[Calcutta High Court]].&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt; However, Judge Field accepted that there was an adulterous relationship between Elokeshi and the ''mahant'', with whom she was seen "joking and flirting".&lt;ref name="sarkar2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarkar|first=Tanika |title=Hindu wife, Hindu nation|publisher=Permanent Black|year=2005|pages=72–74|chapter=Talking about scandals|isbn=81-7824-067-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Markby, who presided over the case in the High Court, also accepted the evidence proving adultery.&lt;ref name="sarkar2"/&gt; The High Court convicted both Nobin and the ''mahant''.  Nobin was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]; the ''mahant'' got 3 years [[rigorous imprisonment]] and a fine of 2000 rupees.&lt;ref name="V&amp;A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="movinghere"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movinghere.org.uk/galleries/histories/asian/culture/painting1.htm|title=Background|work=Moving Here: Migration Histories|accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reaction==
The newspaper ''Bengalee'' remarked: "People flock to the Sessions Court as they would flock to the Lewis Theatre to watch ''[[Othello]]'' being performed". The courtroom drama became a public spectacle. Authorities had to charge an entrance fee to control the crowds at the Hoogly Sessions Court. The right of admission was also restricted to those literate in English, citing that the ''mahant'''s British lawyer and the judge only spoke in English.&lt;ref name="sarkar2"/&gt;

The overruling of the Indian jury's decision by the Sessions Court judge was heavily debated.&lt;ref name="sarkar2"/&gt; According to Swati Chattopadhyay (author of ''Representing Calcutta: Modernity, Nationalism and the Colonial Uncanny''), the court proceedings were seen as an interference by the British in local matters. The court represented a conflict between village and city, the priest and ''[[bhadralok]]'' (Bengali gentleman class) and the colonial state and nationalist subjects.&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyay"/&gt; The court proceedings were disturbed several times by crowds demanding clemency for Nobin or stringency for the ''mahant''. The ''mahant'' and his English lawyer were often attacked outside the court.&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt; The ''mahant's'' punishment was termed lenient by the Bengali public. Nobin was released in 1875, following several public petitions for pardon.&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt; Such pleas came from members of the Calcutta elite and district town notables, local royals and "acknowledged leaders of native society", as well as from the "lower middle class"—from whom a 10,000-signature mercy plea was received.&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt;

[[File:The Mahant turns an oil press.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The ''mahant'' turns an oil press in prison.]]
The 1873 ''mahant''–Elokeshi incident was not the first incident against a ''mahant'' of Tarakeswar. ''Mahant'' Shrimanta Giri was executed in 1824 for the murder of his mistress's lover. However, according to Sarkar (author of ''Hindu wife, Hindu nation''), while the 1824 scandal hardly created any public outrage and faded quickly from public memory, the 1873 affair was embedded in public memory and created a huge sensation in contemporary Bengal. When a ''[[satyagraha]]'' was organised against the reigning ''mahant'' of Tarakeswar, Satish Giri, in 1974 for his sexual and financial misconduct, the 1873 affair was alluded to several times.&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt;

A regional daily reported that the ''mahant'''s affair with Elokeshi was still discussed by the common people of Bengal, who did not know of other current affairs, even six months after the murder. Bengali newspapers followed the court trial on a day-to-day basis, often reporting it verbatim and capturing the responses of all parties involved: judges, jury, lawyers and the common man. The "culpability" of each of the characters of the scandal was debated, and British justice and Hindu norms were analysed, especially by British-owned newspapers.&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt; While Missionaries interpreted the public outcry against the ''mahant'' as the "disenchantment" of the Hindus, British-owned newspapers also pondered over the question of asserting more control on Hindu temples and organisations.&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt; In an era when [[Hindu reform movements]] were blossoming in Bengal, the scandal led the reformist as well as orthodox society to re-examine "the relationship between Hindu norms, leaders and women".&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt;

Many products were specially manufactured to commemorate the event. [[Sari]]s, fish knives, betel-leaf boxes and other memorabilia with Elokeshi's name printed or inscribed on them were made. A balm for headache was advertised as using the oil made by the ''mahant'' in the jail oil press. Such commemorative items were still in sale in as late as 1894. These items were unique in the sense that they were the only such commemorative items modelled on an event.&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt;

==In the arts==
{{double image|right|Elokeshi_meets_the_Mahanta.jpg|170|Elokeshi is Offering Betel Leaf to the Mahant.jpg|170|Elokeshi (in blue sari) meets the ''mahant'' (bearded man) for the first time, with the [[Taraknath Temple]] shrine of [[Tarakeswar]] in background|Elokeshi is offering betel leaf to the ''mahant''}}

At least 34 farces were published by the "popular press" on the events of the Tarakeswar affair—the rape, the murder and the trial.  At least four of these were reprinted several times. This is the largest number of 19th-century farces in Bengal created in response to a contemporary event.&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt; Farces and plays of the era were often inspired by the real courtroom drama.&lt;ref name="sarkar2"/&gt;  At least 19 plays were also based on the scandal, all of which became very popular and big money-makers; especially ''Mohanter Ei ki Kaj!'' became a huge hit on stage.&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt; Plays written as late as 1924 referred to the affair as if it was common public knowledge.&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt; 

Numerous [[Kalighat painting]]s and Battala woodwork prints—created in the decade after the scandal—depicted the "immoral" affair, the gruesome murder and the resultant trial.&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sarkar1"/&gt; According to Chattopadhyay (author of ''Representing Calcutta: modernity, nationalism, and the colonial uncanny''), it was the popularity of the plays combined with "the rhetoric of sin and morality" that inspired Kalighat painters to present this "tragedy as a spectacle".&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyay"/&gt; Kalighat painters often chose to paint mythological themes and Bengali day-to-day life; the paintings on the Tarakeswar affair were a unique exception.&lt;ref name="sarkar2"/&gt;

Often painted as a series, the Kalighat paintings depict various scenes related to the affair: the ''mahant'' riding on an elephant ''[[howdah]]'';  ''The Meeting of Elokeshi and the mahant''—Elokeshi goes to the temple with her sister and meets the ''mahant''; ''The Seduction''—Elokeshi offering ''[[paan]]'' (betel nut leaf), the ''mahant'' fans Elokeshi and/or the ''mahant'' offering her childbirth medicine in order to drug her before raping her; Elokeshi embracing Nobin and asking his forgiveness; the three stages of the murder such as ''The Fatal/First Blow'' (Nobin about to decapitate Elokeshi with a fish knife) and ''After the murder'' (Nobin with the decapitated body of Elokeshi). The Kalighat paintings also depict a courtroom scene of the trial of the ''mahant'' followed by the ''mahant'' in jail, enduring rigorous labour turning an oil press or working as a jail gardener, while jail guards or the superintendent watch over him.&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="V&amp;Asearch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?listing_type=imagetext&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=15&amp;narrow=0&amp;q=elokeshi&amp;commit=Search&amp;quality=0&amp;objectnamesearch=&amp;placesearch=&amp;after=&amp;after-adbc=AD&amp;before=&amp;before-adbc=AD&amp;namesearch=&amp;materialsearch=&amp;mnsearch=&amp;locationsearch=|title=Tarakeshwar affair|work=Official site of Museum|publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plays and the paintings suggested the theme of loss of traditional Indian culture in the face of colonialism.&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyay"/&gt;

==Assessment and portrayal of the characters==
Most accounts agree that Nobin loved his wife dearly, evidenced by the fact that he was ready to accept his wife at first and run away with her, even after knowledge of the affair.&lt;ref name="sarkar4"/&gt; In an era where the chastity of a wife was highly valued, Nobin's blind love and acceptance of a guilty wife were deemed inappropriate by a large section of society. Her murder was considered justifiable. Some songs criticise Nobin's stupidity of trying to save his adulterous wife and thereby risking his own life.&lt;ref name="sarkar4"/&gt; Police reports, confirming Nobin's love, read that after the murder, Nobin rushed to the police saying: "Hang me quick. This world is wilderness to me. I am impatient to join my wife in the next [world/life]", a line reported verbatim in newspapers as well as used in plays and songs.&lt;ref name="sarkar4"/&gt; Some public petitions argued that given a choice to leave Elokeshi in the arms of the ''mahant'' to live a life of dishonour—which was worse than death—and to kill her, like a true husband, Nobin chose the latter to end her misery.&lt;ref name="sarkar4"/&gt; However, some plays portray that Nobin has a mistress in town so leaves his wife in the village.&lt;ref name="sarkar4"/&gt;

[[File:Mahant offers Ekokeshi childbirth medicine.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The ''mahant'' offers Elokeshi childbirth medicine, to drug her before raping her]]
Most of the plays were named to suggest the main crime was not Elokeshi's murder by Nobin, but the immoral activities of the ''mahant''. The ''mahant'' is portrayed as the root cause of Elokeshi's death, which was an "inevitable conclusion" of the ''mahant'' 's activities. Elokeshi, "the object of desire", had to be killed by Nobin to restore his honour.&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyay"/&gt; Titles of such plays reinforce the theme and focus on the ''mahant'''s crime. Examples include: ''Mohanter Chakrabhraman'', ''Mohanter Ki Saja'', ''Mohanter Karabash'' and ''Mohanter Ei Ki Dasha''.&lt;ref name="sarkar3"/&gt;

The Kalighat paintings and Battala woodcuts often depict the ''mahant'' as a womaniser and the temple as "a haven for pimps".&lt;ref name="sarkar3"/&gt; He was also described as "a vile seducer".&lt;ref name="sarkar4"/&gt; The Tarakeswar shrine was a famed cure for barren women. The ''mahant'' was rumoured to seduce women like Elokeshi who came to him for childbirth medicine and appropriate them with the help of his goons. After being raped, the women could not return to their family and languished in the brothels of Tarakeswar.&lt;ref name="sarkar3"/&gt; In most plays, the ''mahant'' is described as drugging Elokeshi—by offering fake childbirth medicine—and then raping her.&lt;ref name="sarkar4"/&gt; In the play ''Mohanter Dafarafa'', a rare exception to the general theme of immorality in plays where the ''mahant'' misuses Elokeshi, his love is portrayed to be genuine and her seduction by him a resultant after-effect. However, later he is repentant.&lt;ref name="sarkar3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarkar|first=Tanika |title=Hindu wife, Hindu nation|publisher=Permanent Black|year=2005|pages=79–82|chapter=Talking about scandals|isbn=81-7824-067-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Bengalee'', a reformist newspaper, presents a rare view of the true victim Elokeshi being forgotten in the debate of the trial and sympathy towards Nobin.&lt;ref name="sarkar4"/&gt; In the ''First Meeting'' painting, Elokeshi is sometimes depicted as a courtesan, indicating that she is the one who seduces the ''mahant''. She is often described as unchaste and to have developed the adulterous affair and even lived with him for some time despite the fact that he first rapes her.&lt;ref name="sarkar4"/&gt; In one play, Elokeshi's character is debated by village wives and prostitutes. The wives vilify Elokeshi as an unchaste woman, question her devotion for Nobin and express the belief that a woman cannot be raped without her consent. The prostitutes empathise with Elokeshi, another victim of male lust and lament her fall from grace, which for them illustrates the brittle status of a wife.&lt;ref name="sarkar4"/&gt; Some plays depict Elokeshi as having no choice but to surrender to the ''mahant'''s lust on her father's command. Such plays concentrate more on scenes where Elokeshi gives in to her father's orders than on the depiction of rape.&lt;ref name="sarkar4"/&gt;

One farce depicts a divine trial of not only Elokeshi and the ''mahant'', but also of her parents, who are portrayed as being equally guilty. Elokeshi is condemned for seducing the ''mahant'' and tarnishing the name of the holy shrine of Tarakeswar. The ''mahant'' is punished for misusing the authority and money of the temple.&lt;ref name="sarkar2"/&gt; One newspaper describes Elokeshi's father as "the still worse scoundrel (worse than the ''mahant'') who bartered his daughter's virtue".&lt;ref name="sarkar4"/&gt; In many plays, Elokeshi's father, who is now sexually incompetent, is driven by the greed of Elokeshi's young stepmother and he resorts to pleasing his wife by giving gifts like jewellery, for which he sells off his daughter to the ''mahant''.&lt;ref name="sarkar4"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarkar|first=Tanika |title=Hindu wife, Hindu nation|publisher=Permanent Black|year=2005|pages=85–90|chapter=Talking about scandals|isbn=81-7824-067-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elokeshi's staying at her parents' home—and not with her husband—is also blamed for their excessive control over her.&lt;ref name="sarkar4"/&gt;

'''Thathai Bhatias''' is a [[Rajput]] clan settled in India. This clan migrated to India from the [[Thatta District]], [[Sindh]] after [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of Pakistan in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sevafund.net.in  Thathai Bhatia Community]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/straight-talk-the-grand-old-man-1.458317 Straight Talk: The grand old man], by Subramani Dharmarajan, Senior Reporter, Gulf News, September 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically, their origins are from [[Jaisalmer]]. The community was originally known as ''Bhattis''. After they dispersed from Jaisalmer post the Mughal invasion to north of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Kutch]], [[Bahawalpur]], [[Multan]], and also to a place called [[Thatta]] in [[Sindh]], the Bhattis started being identified with their respective geographies; for example, the Bhattis in Kutch became the ''Kutchi Bhatias'' and the Bhattis in Thatta became ''Thattai Bhatias''.


The language spoken by the Bhatias differ based on the geographical areas they settled into.Before India-Pakistan partition,Large sections of Thattai Bhatias, originally from Jaisalmer,had migrated to a place called Thatta, a small region landlocked around the borders of Sindh &amp; Kutch regions.Thattai Bhatias speak Bhatia language which is unique in itself,however some words &amp; dialects have influences similar to Kutchhi &amp; Sindhi.This is primarily the reason why in the modern world many people mistakenly think  Thattai Bhatias to be Sindhis. This Thatta area is now in Sindh province of Pakistan. Since,the origin of Thatta Bhatias , who follow Vaishnav sect,roots back to Jaisalmer,in Rajasthan their deity of religious worship is Shrinathji. The Kuldevi of Thattai Bhatia Sendhni Mataji - a form of Goddess Durga is mostly seen sitting on Camel,roots backs to its origin in Jaislamer. 
In today's times one of the strongest clan of Bhatias found in UAE &amp; middle eastern countries is Thattai Bhatias -some the richest &amp; leading business holders, especially in Bahrain. &lt;ref name="Tales"&gt;''Dubai Tales, A Collection of Short Stories'' by Mohammad Al Mur, translated from Arabic by Peter Clark, Motivate Publishing, London, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Thattai Bhatias were considered amongst the top three Indian communities undertaking trading relations with Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.&lt;ref&gt;India’'s ‘Look West’ Policy and Its Impact on India, GCC Relations, International Politics, Vol. 3, No. VI, Summer &amp; Autumn 2010, Ginu Zacharia Oommen, Khurshid Imam, Jawaharlal Nehru University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Global World of Indian Merchants, 1715 to 1947, Traders of Sind from Bukhara to Panama, by Claude Markovits, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walk Thru the Bible Ministries''' (WTB) is a non-denominational [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christian]] educational organization headquartered in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

==Overview==
Walk Thru the Bible was founded in the [[United States]] in 1976 by [[Bruce Wilkinson]] and [[Howard Hendricks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sara Westhead|title=Pastor Simons brings Teaching with Style back to the Island|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20110212/ISLAND08/702129953|accessdate=November 10, 2015|work=Royal Gazette|date=February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main purpose is to teach evangelical Christian biblical doctrines, primarily through an innovative [[seminar]] format, while providing additional resources through print, audio and video media productions. As a [[parachurch]] organization, Walk Thru the Bible works in cooperation with local churches who host and publicize the seminars to their congregations and surrounding communities.

The organization's non-traditional audience-participatory [[Methodology|methodologies]] have resulted in rapid worldwide growth, with a WTB presence, by means of trained WTB seminar instructors, in over 90 countries. Borrowing from the business-world concept of the [[independent contractor]] or [[Franchising|franchise]], WTB trains "Associate Instructors" who then "manage their own local ministry" and interface with churches and private schools in their region to present the various WTB [[multimedia]] seminars.

WTB's original goal was to train and equip one instructor for every 50,000 people, in every country of the world. More recently, this goal has been augmented with an effort to establish instructors connected to local churches in 1,000 high-density cities in various countries.
WTB is reported to have trained over 100,000 instructors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=David Yonke|title=Author sets Toledo stop in fight to cut abortion|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/Religion/2012/01/28/Author-sets-Toledo-stop-in-fight-to-cut-abortion.html|accessdate=November 12, 2015|work=Toledo Blade|date=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After becoming a best-selling author, Wilkinson stepped down from leadership of WTB,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Timothy Morgan|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/february/8.76.html |title=Jabez Author Quits Africa |accessdate=November 10, 2015|publisher=Christianity Today|date=February 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was succeeded as president by [[Chip Ingram]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="Salem2005"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://investor.salem.cc/manual-releases/99-5-KKLA-FM-Radio-Host-Chip-Ingram-to-Speak-on-Lo|title=99.5 KKLA-FM Radio Host Chip Ingram to Speak on Love, Sex and Lasting Relationships March 15|date=February 28, 2005|publisher=[[Salem Communications]]|accessdate=July 5, 2013|location=[[Los Angeles]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406010312/http://investor.salem.cc/manual-releases/99-5-KKLA-FM-Radio-Host-Chip-Ingram-to-Speak-on-Lo |archivedate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ingram was later succeeded by [[Phil Tuttle (pastor)|Phil Tuttle]], the current president.&lt;ref name="AboutWalkThru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkthru.org/our-story|title=About Walk Thru|publisher=Walk Thru the Bible|accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
At the [[National Religious Broadcasters]]' 2007 Annual Media Awards, WTB won an award for "Best Ministry Website".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walk Thru the Bible Wins National Religious Broadcasters Ministry Website of the Year Media Award|url=http://www.chron.com/news/article/BW-Walk-Thru-the-Bible-Wins-National-Religious-1821100.php|website=Convio Press Release|publisher=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=12 November 2015|date=February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
