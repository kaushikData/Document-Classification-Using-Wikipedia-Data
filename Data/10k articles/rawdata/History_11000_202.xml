{{Campaignbox Northern Ireland Troubles|state=collapsed}}

On the 28 March 1991 the [[Ulster Loyalist|Loyalist paramilitary]] organization the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) carried out a gun attack on a mobile shop in the Drumbeg estate in the town of [[Craigavon]] in [[County Armagh]] shooting dead three [[Irish Catholics|Catholic civilians]]. Two of those killed were teenage girls.&lt;ref name="ulst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=28&amp;month=03&amp;year=1991|author=Malcolm Sutton|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the former [[Loyalist Volunteer Force]] leader and at that time in 1991 [[UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade]] commander [[Billy Wright (loyalist)|Billy Wright]] had planned and ordered the attack. Those killed were Eileen Duffy (19), Katrina Rennie (16) and Brian Frizzell (29).

==Background==
The year 1991 during [[The Troubles]] saw a return to the tit-for-tat sectarian killings between [[Irish Republican]] and [[Ulster Loyalist]] paramilitaries that plagued [[Belfast]], Armagh and other places in [[Northern Ireland]] during the mid 1970s which saw hundreds of both Catholic and Protestant civilians killed.&lt;ref name="ulst2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch75.htm|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1975|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ulst3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch76.htm|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1976|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ulst4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch77.htm|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1977|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just three weeks earlier, in the [[1991 Cappagh killings]], the UVF carried out a gun attack on a pub in the staunchly Republican [[County Tyrone]] village of [[Cappagh, County Tyrone|Cappagh]], killing one civilian and three IRA members.&lt;ref name="ulst5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=3&amp;month=03&amp;year=1991|author=Malcolm Sutton|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shooting==
The two teenage girls who were killed were sitting behind the counter in the mobile shop along with a third teenage girl, Jamie Smith. There was several people in the shop at the time and the girls were talking among themselves. A van pulled up outside the shop and a masked gunman wearing military style clothing, armed with a 9mm Browning pistol, jumped out. One of the people in the shop presuming it was [[Irish Republicanism|Republicans]] yelled "Provisional IRA, hit the floor!". Most people managed to escape, but the three girls were stuck and trapped behind the counter. The gunman pulled Jamie Smith by the hair calling her a "[[Fenian]] slut" and then threw her out of the shop. The UVF gunman then shot Duffy and Rennie, killing them both. While the attack was taking place, Brian Frizzell walked into the shop, and was shot as the gunman was leaving the store.&lt;ref name="ulst6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch91.htm#28391|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1991|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eileen's brother Brendan Duffy was one of the first at the shop after the attack, he described the scene:
 
"Brian Frizzell was lying in a pool of blood. Katrina was still sitting on the crate. She was dead but her blue eyes were wide open and there was a bullet wound on her neck. Eileen was slumped on the floor, shot in the head. Her face was badly swollen and blood was pumping out of her head and ears. I tried to resuscitate her but in my heart I knew she was gone. I was so numb, I couldn't cry." &lt;ref name="nuzhound"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/breen/arts2011/sep18_Eileen_Duffy_murder_evidence_destroyed__SBreen_Sunday-World.php|website=nuzhound.com|title=Newshound: Links to daily newspaper articles about Northern Ireland|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The killings drew widespread condemnation from both the [[Irish Catholics|Catholic]] and [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant]] communities in Northern Ireland. The funerals were attended by thousands of people. 

It's believed the killings of Protestant civilians Derek Patterson on the 9 April &amp; Ian Sproule on the 12 April were in retaliation to the Drumbeg killings. &lt;ref&gt;http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=13&amp;month=04&amp;year=1991&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1991/IRA-Says-It-Killed-Relative-Of-Legislator/id-63727dcdd20b39f86e2b9cc86b2a9679&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Aaron Edwards - UVF: Behind The Mask p.203&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight months after the attack three more civilians were killed by the UVF in the Craigavon area at the Carbet Road-Carn Road junction. Desmond Rogers (54), Fergus Magee (28), and John Lavery (27) were shot dead, Rogers and Magee were Catholics, Lavery a Protestant. The three men were shot in their car after being stopped at an illegal UVF checkpoint (a similar tactic to that used by the UVF in the [[Miami Showband killings]]1975). The UVF later apologized for killing the Protestant man. &lt;ref&gt;http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=14&amp;month=11&amp;year=1991&lt;/ref&gt;In October 1992, a man, Vicky Ahitty (24), from Portadown, was charged with these and other murders and firearms possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man in court over Ulster killings|work=The Independent (Jason Bennetto, 25 October 1992)|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/man-in-court-over-ulster-killings-1559543.html|accessdate=4 December 2011|location=London, UK|date=25 October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Tom Harper was charged with the Drumbeg mobile shop murders, although he was the driver and not the gunman. He was given a life sentence for his part in the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Murder accused from town|work=Lurgan Mail (24 August 2010)|url=http://www.lurganmail.co.uk/news/local/murder_accused_from_town_1_1781673|accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was ordered by [[Billy Wright (loyalist)|Billy Wright]], but the gunman has never been charged. Local allegations of security force collusion remain and it was noted that, on the night of the shooting, the normally heavy police presence was not apparent. In September 2011, the PSNI announced that records of interviews with suspects in key murder investigations from 1985 to 1993 had been destroyed in 1998 as the place they were stored was contaminated with asbestos. They included the records in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No justice for mobile shop murder families after evidence is destroyed|work=Sunday World (Suzanne Breen, 18 September 2011)|url=http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/breen/arts2011/sep18_Eileen_Duffy_murder_evidence_destroyed__SBreen_Sunday-World.php|accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2018">'''Aage Gerhard Skavlan''' (22 December 1847 – 24 February 1920) was a Norwegian historian.

He was born in [[Herøy, Møre og Romsdal|Herøy]] as a son of [[dean (religion)|dean]] [[Aage Schavland]] (1806–1876) and his wife Gerhardine Pauline Bergh (1817–1884). He was a great-grandnephew of vicar [[Jacob Schavland]], nephew of vicar [[Gerhard B. Bergh]] and a brother of [[Sigvald Skavlan]], [[Einar Skavlan, Sr.]], [[Olaf Skavlan]] and [[Harald Skavlan]].&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Skavlan, Aage Gerhard|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|editor=[[Einar Jansen|Jansen, Einar]] |editor2=[[Paulus Svendsen|Svendsen, Paulus]] |editor3=[[Jonas Jansen|Jansen, Jonas]] |editor4=[[Øyvind Anker|Anker, Øyvind]]|edition=1st|first=Halvdan|last=Koht|authorlink=Halvdan Koht|year=1958|volume=13|pages=489–490|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from [[Trondheim katedralskole|Trondhjem Cathedral School]] in 1868 and took the [[cand.theol.]] degree in 1872. He spent his early career as a school teacher, but also researched history. He was given a royal scholarship in 1877 to conduct studies at the [[University of Copenhagen]] and [[Lund University]], and in 1878 he published his first book ''Historiske Billeder fra den nyere Tid i Danmark, Norge og tildels Sverige''. In 1881 he received a parliamentary grant to write a history on [[Norway in 1814]]; he released books on this topic in 1882, 1884, 1892 and 1899. He worked as archivist in Trondhjem from 1890 to 1891, and at the [[University Library of Oslo]] from 1899. After 1900 his research was hampered by illness. He did not marry, and died in February 1920 in [[Oslo|Kristiania]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

'''Andrew Horn''' ({{circa|1275}}–1328) was a [[fishmonger]] of Bridge Street, [[London]], lawyer and legal scholar.

Horn is best known for his book ''[[Liber Horn]]'', compiled in 1311. Besides coroners' reports and other mundane matters, ''Liber Horn'' contains some of the earliest and most reliable versions of early English laws, including certain ''[[Statutes of uncertain date]]'' and an annotated copy of the [[Magna carta#The Great Charter 1297: Statute|Magna Carta of 1297]].&lt;ref name="SharpeCommittee1913"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Reginald Robinson|last1=Sharpe|last2=City of London (England).

==Works==
As a legal scholar, Andrew Horn's literary achievements consisted largely of compiling, editing, transcribing, and annotating statutes, pipe rolls, chronicles, and other official documents. This has resulted in a problem of attribution, since it is not always clear to what extent he acted as author or editor.

'''Andrew Rossos''' is a [[Macedonian Canadian]] ٰProfessor Emeritus of History at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/rezensionen/2008-4-042.pdf Rezension für H-Soz-Kult von Stefan Troebst, Geisteswissenschaftliches Zentrum Geschichte und Kultur Ostmitteleuropas (GWZO), Universität Leipzig - "Macedonia and the Macedonians: A History"'', 2008] (in German). Citation: ''Rossos selbst ist makedonischer Herkunft, geboren im zu Griechenland gehörigen Ägäisch-Makedonien.'' in English: ''Rossos himself is of Macedonian origin, born in Aegean Macedonia belonging to Greece''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Rossos was born in 1941 in the village of [[Moschochori, Florina|Moschochori]], [[Florina (regional unit)|Florina]], [[Greece]]. During the [[Greek Civil War]] in 1948, he was evacuated to [[Czechoslovakia]] as a [[Refugees of the Greek Civil War|refugee child]]. Rossos attended primary school in [[Sobotin]] and Technical School in [[Prague]]. In 1958 he moved with the rest of his family to [[Canada]] and graduated from high school in [[Toronto]]. Rossos earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in history at [[Michigan State University]] in 1963 and did his postgraduate studies at the [[University of Stanford]], earning his [[PhD]] in 1971. Since then he has worked at the [[University of Toronto]] and became a [[professor]] there in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Македонска енциклопедија. Скопје, 2009, т.ІІ, 1282.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2008, his book ''Macedonia and the Macedonians: A History'' was published. He authored a monograph on [[Russian foreign policy]] in the [[Balkans]] titled ''Russia and the Balkans: Inter-Balkan Rivalries and Russian Foreign Policy, 1908-1914''.

[[File:Sanderus - Frontispies FI.png|thumb|Front page of the first edition (1641) of the ''[[Flandria Illustrata]]'']]
'''Antonius Sanderus''' (15 September 1586 – 10 January 1664) was a [[Flanders|Flemish]] Catholic cleric and historian.

==Biography==
Sanderus was born "Antoon Sanders", but like all writers and scholars of his time he Latinized his name. Having become master of philosophy at the [[University of Douai]] in 1609, he studied theology for some years under [[Johannes Malderus]] (Jan van Malderen) at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]], and [[Willem Hessels van Est]] (Estius) at Douai, and was ordained [[priest]] at [[Ghent]].

For some years he was engaged in parochial duties, and combated the [[Anabaptist]] movement in Flanders with great zeal and success. In 1625 he became secretary and [[almoner]] of Cardinal [[Alfonso de la Cueva, 1st Marquis of Bedmar|Alfonso de la Cueva]], later becoming [[Canon (priest)|canon]] and [[scholaster]] of [[St Martin's Cathedral, Ypres]]. Publication of the first volume of his sumptuously illustrated ''Flandria illustrata'' (1641) nearly bankrupted him, and he was rescued from ruination by an award of 1,000 florins through the [[Lille Chamber of Accounts]].&lt;ref&gt;Jules Finot (ed.), ''Inventaire sommaire des archives départementales antérieures à 1790. Nord. Archives Civiles, série B. Chambre des Comptes de Lille'', vol. 6 (Lille, 1888), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Further such subventions in support of his work followed in 1645, 1651, 1655 and 1662.&lt;ref&gt;Finot, ''Inventaire sommaire'', vol. 6, pp. 178, 205, 231, 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1654 he was appointed [[Canon penitentiary|penitentiary]] at [[Ypres]]. After three years, however, he resigned this office to devote himself entirely to scientific, and especially to historical studies. He soon found himself compelled to claim the hospitality of the [[Benedictine]] [[Abbey]] of Afflighem, since he had reduced himself to absolute poverty by the publication of numerous works.

==Writings==
He combined high intellectual gifts with great zeal, and left behind forty-two printed, and almost as many unprinted, works. The most important are the following:
* ''De scriptoribus Flandriae libri III'' (Antwerp, 1624)
* ''De Gandavensibus eruditionis fama claris'' (Antwerp 1624)
* ''De Brugensibus eruditionis fama claris libri II'' (Antwerp, 1624)
* ''Hagiologium Flandriae sive de sanctis eius provinciae liber unus'' (Antwerp, 1625; 2nd ed., Lille, 1639).

A general edition of these four works appeared under the title: ''Flandria illustrata'' (2 volumes, Cologne, 1641–44; The Hague, 1726).

Of his other works may be mentioned:
* ''Elogia cardinalium sanctitate, doctrina et armis illustrium'' (Louvain, 1625)
* ''Gandavium sive rerum Gandavensium libri VI'' (Brussels, 1627)
* ''Bibliotheca belgica manuscripta'' (2 parts, Lille, 1641-3)
* ''Chorographia sacra Brabantiae sive celebrium in ea provincia ecclesiarum et coenobiorum descriptio, imaginibus aeneis illustrata'' (Brussels, 1659; The Hague, 1726); this is his chief work.

'''Arthur Herbert Carman''' (2 August 1902 &amp;ndash; 28 November 1982) was a New Zealand sports journalist and writer, bookseller, publisher, [[pacifist]], local politician, and local historian.

He was born and died in [[Wellington]], New Zealand.&lt;ref name="DNZB Carman"&gt;{{DNZB|title=Arthur Herbert Carman|first= David|last= Grant|id=4c8|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Paparangi]], [[Johnsonville, New Zealand|Johnsonville]], and lived in [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa]] (originally called Tawa Flat). In 1932 Carman moved to Ranui in Tawa, with his new wife Edith Clark; they lived at No 7 Iti Street, Linden. Arthur had been in the Audit Department but, hankering for a bureaucracy free life, decided to become a [[Lambton Quay]] bookseller. They liked the countryside, although Ranui had barely formed metal roads and it was quicker for Edith to push the pram along the rail tracks to Tawa, picking up lumps of coal en route. Arthur caught the morning train to the shop. He started the agitation for a station at [[Linden railway station, New Zealand|Linden]] to avoid having to pull the emergency cord to alight at Linden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Cassells |first= Ken R.  |title= Tawa: Enterprise and Endeavour  |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year=  1988 |publisher=  Tawa Borough Council |location= Wellington  |isbn= 0-473-00715-0 |oclc= |page= 59 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a bookseller and publisher (as '''Wright and Carman''', founded by his father Walter Carman); his [[Lambton Quay]] bookshop was a landmark and meeting place for thirty years. ''Arthur Carman Street'' in [[Paparangi]] is named after him.

He was on several local bodies: the [[Wellington Hospital Board]], the Tawa Borough Council and the Hutt Valley Power and Gas Board. He stood unsuccessfully as an independent for the [[Wellington City Council]] in [[Wellington City mayoral election, 1941|1941]] and [[Wellington City mayoral election, 1944|1944]], and also for [[Wellington North (New Zealand electorate)|Wellington North]] in the [[New Zealand general election, 1943|1943 general election]], his only avenue to debate pacifism legally in wartime New Zealand.&lt;ref name="DNZB Carman"/&gt;

He published sports books as Arthur Carman (''The New Zealand Rugby Almanack'', ''The New Zealand Cricket Almanack''; both annuals) and local history books as '''A. H. Carman''' or '''Arthur H. Carman'''. These included ''The Birth of a City: Wellington 1840-1843'' and ''Tawa Flat and the Old [[Porirua]] Road'', which went into three editions (1956, 1970, 1982)

He was noted as a [[Christian pacifism|Christian pacifist]], and spent some months in [[Miramar Peninsula|Mt Crawford]] prison in Wellington, NZ in 1941, for 'subversion' when he attempted to publicly espouse the Christian pacifist view.  His viewpoint had changed from traditional [[Methodism]] toward [[Quakerism]] following a 1925 visit to the [[World War I]] battlefields (he had been touring the United Kingdom as the sole press correspondent travelling with the [[1924–25 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France|'Invincibles' All Black rugby team]]), although he remained a Methodist local preacher for the whole of his life.

A biography was published in 2011, by [[Bruce Murray (cricketer)|Bruce Murray]] and David Wood: ''Arthur Carman's Suitcase: The Life and Times of Arthur Herbert Carman''.&lt;ref name="Carman's Suitcase"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dando |first1=Kris |title=Old suitcase a treasure for Tawa historian |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/kapi-mana-news/5197534/Old-suitcase-a-treasure-for-Tawa-historian |website=stuff.co.nz |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baby Scoop Era''' was a period in [[anglosphere]] history starting after the end of [[World War II]] and ending in the early 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babyscoopera.com The Baby Scoop Era Research Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; characterized by an increased rate of [[Premarital sex|pre-marital pregnancies]] over the preceding period, along with a higher rate of newborn [[adoption]].

==History==

===In the United States===
From 1945 to 1973, it is estimated that up to 4 million parents in the [[United States]] had children placed for adoption, with 2 million during the 1960s alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~adoption/topics/adoptionstatistics.htm |title=Adoption Statistics |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=The Adoption History Project |publisher=University of Oregon |accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annual numbers for non-relative adoptions increased from an estimated 33,800 in 1951 to a peak of 89,200 in 1970, then quickly declined to an estimated 47,700 in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Pelton, L. (1988). "The Institution of Adoption: Its Sources and Perpetuation" in ''Infertility and Adoption, A Guide for Social Work Practice'', Deborah Valentine, Editor. (pp. 88–89)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maza"&gt;[http://www.uoregon.edu/~adoption/archive/MazaAT.htm Maza, P.L. (1984). Adoption trends: 1944–1975.] Child Welfare Research Notes #9. Washington, D.C.: Administration for Children, Youth, and Families, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  (This does not include the number of infants adopted and raised by relatives.&lt;ref name="Maza" /&gt;) In contrast, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] estimates that only 14,000 infants were placed for adoption in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/s_place.cfm U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Child Welfare Information Gateway (2005).  Voluntary Relinquishment for Adoption:  Numbers and Trends]&lt;/ref&gt;

This period of history has been documented in scholarly books such as ''Wake Up Little Susie'' and ''Beggars and Choosers'', both by historian [[Rickie Solinger]], and social histories such as the book ''[[The Girls Who Went Away]]'' and the documentary, ''[[A Girl Like Her]]'', based on the book by Ann Fessler.  Fessler is a professor of photography at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] who exhibited an [[art installation]] titled ''The Girls Who Went Away''.  It is also the theme of the documentary "Gone To A Good Home" by [[Film Australia]].

Beginning in the 1940s and 1950s, [[illegitimacy]] began to be defined in terms of psychological deficits on the part of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;Solinger, R. (2000). ''Wake Up Little Susie: Single Pregnancy and Race Before Roe v. Wade.'' (p. 88)&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, a liberalization of sexual mores combined with restrictions on access to [[birth control]] led to an increase in premarital pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, A. (1998). ''Gone to an Aunt's: Remembering Canada's Homes for Unwed Mothers.'' (pp. 7–8)&lt;/ref&gt;  The dominant psychological and social work view was that the large majority of unmarried mothers were better off being separated by adoption from their newborn babies.&lt;ref&gt;O'Shaughnassy, T. (1994). ''Adoption, [[Social Work]], and Social Theory'' (p. 115)&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Mandell (2007), "In most cases, adoption was presented to the mothers as the only option and little or no effort was made to help the mothers keep and raise the children".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue42/Mandell42.htm Mandell, B. (2007). "Adoption."] ''New Politics'', Vol. 11, No. 2, Winter 2007, Whole No. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Solinger describes the social pressures that led to this unusual trend, explaining that women who had no control over their reproductive lives were defined by psychological theory as "not-mothers", and that because they had no control over their reproductive lives, they were subject to the ideology of those who watched over them. As such, for unmarried pregnant girls and women in the pre-''[[Roe v. Wade|Roe]]'' era, the main chance for attaining home and marriage rested on their acknowledging their alleged shame and guilt, and this required relinquishing their children, with more than 80% of unwed mothers in maternity homes acting in essence as "breeders" for adoptive parents.&lt;ref&gt;Solinger, R. (2000). ''Wake Up Little Susie: Single Pregnancy and Race Before Roe v. Wade.'' (p. 95)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ellison, from 1960 to 1970, 27 percent of all births to married women between the ages of 15 and 29 were conceived [[Premarital Sex#United States|premaritally]]. This problem was thought to be caused by female [[neurosis]], and those who could not procure an [[Abortion in the United States|abortion]], legally or otherwise, were encouraged to put up their children for adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ellison, M.|year=2003|title=Authoritative Knowledge and Single Women's Unintentional Pregnancies, Abortions, Adoption and Single Motherhood: Social Stigma and Structural Violence|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|volume=17|issue=3|page=326|pmid=12974201|doi=10.1525/maq.2003.17.3.322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular usage, singer Celeste Billhartz uses the term "baby scoop era" on her website to refer to the era covered by her work "The Mothers Project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About The Mothers Project ...|author=Celeste Billhartz|work=The Mothers Project|url=http://www.themothersproject.com/about/aboutTMP.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billfinch.org/blog/archive/2006_04_09_archive.html |title=More Adoption Support |date=April 15, 2006 |work=BillFinch.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016172238/http://billfinch.org/blog/archive/2006_04_09_archive.html |archivedate=2007-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on Senator [[Bill Finch (politician)|Bill Finch]]'s website uses the term as well. Writer Betty Mandell references the term in her article "Adoption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Adoption|author=Betty Reid Mandell|url=http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue42/Mandell42.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922060843/http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue42/Mandell42.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2008 |deadurl=no|volume=XI|number=2|journal=New Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also used in a 2004 edition of the ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann, B. "World of Adoption; Forced to Give Up Her Baby, She Now Opposes Adoption," ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]'', November 21, 2004, p. G-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Infant adoptions began declining in the early 1970s, a decline often attributed to the decreasing birth rate, but which also partially resulted from social and legal changes that enabled  middle-class mothers to have an alternative [[single mother]]hood.

The decline in the fertility rate is associated with the introduction of [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] in 1960, the completion of legalization of [[birth control|artificial birth control]] methods, the introduction of [[Title X|federal funding]] to make [[family planning]] services more available to the young and low income, and the legalization of abortion.

Brozinsky (1994) speaks of the decline in newborn adoptions as reflecting a freedom of choice embraced by youth and the women's movement of the 1960s and 1970s, resulting in an increase in the number of unmarried mothers who parented their babies as opposed to having them taken for adoption purposes. "In 1970, approximately 80% of the infants born to single mothers were [...] [taken for adoption purposes], whereas by 1983 that figure had dropped to only 4%."&lt;ref&gt;Brozinsky, A. (1994). "Surrendering an Infant for Adoption:  The Birthmother Experience".  In ''The Psychology of Adoption'', D. Brozinsky and M. Schechter (Eds.).  New York:  Oxford University Press. (p. 297)&lt;/ref&gt;  

In contrast to numbers in the 1960s and 1970s, from 1989 to 1995 fewer than 1% of children born to never-married women were surrendered for adoption.&lt;ref&gt;Chandra, A., Abma, J., Maza, P., &amp; Bachrach, C.

===In the Commonwealth===

====In Canada====
Canada's "Baby Scoop Era" refers to the postwar period from 1945 to 1988, when over 400,000 unmarried pregnant persons, mostly aged 15–19 (usually Caucasian), were targeted for their yet-to-be-born infants, simply because they were unmarried with a child. A large number of these young women were confined as inmates in maternity group homes, which were managed by religious orders, such as the [[The Salvation Army, Canada|Salvation Army]], the [[Catholic Church in Canada|Catholic Church]], the [[United Church of Canada|United Church]] and the [[Anglican Church of Canada|Anglican Church]] etc. These maternity "homes" were heavily funded by the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]]. There were over 70 maternity homes in Canada which housed between 20 and 200 pregnant women at a time. In Canadian maternity "homes" and hospitals, up to 100% of newborns were removed from their legal mothers after birth and given up for adoption purposes. These newborns were taken under a Health and Welfare protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Leigh Ann|title=Taken|journal=Anglican Journal|date=May 13, 2014|url=http://www.anglicanjournal.com/articles/taken|accessdate=July 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some professionals of the era considered that the punishment of the mother for her transgression was an important part of the process. Dr. Marion Hilliard of [[Women's College Hospital]] was quoted in 1956 saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;The father plays absolutely no part in this. That is part of her rehabilitation. When she renounces her child for its own good, the unwed mother has learned a lot. She has learned an important human value. She has learned to pay the price of her misdemeanor, and this alone, if punishment is needed, is punishment enough...We must go back to a primary set of values and the discipline that starts with the very small child.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Howarth, “Mothers not all unhappy”, ''The Toronto Telegram'', November 22, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The term Baby Scoop Era is similar to the term [[Sixties Scoop]], which was coined by Patrick Johnston, author of ''Native Children and the Child Welfare System''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research2.csci.educ.ubc.ca/indigenation/Indian_ReACTions/Indian_ReACTions/SixtiesScoop.htm Reder, D. (2007). ''Indian re:ACT(ions)''] University of British Columbia&lt;/ref&gt; "Sixties Scoop" refers to the Canadian practice, beginning in the 1960s and continuing until the late 1980s, of apprehending unusually high numbers of Native children over the age of 5 years old from their families and fostering or adopting them out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_01.13.00/news/nation.php Lyons, T.

Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar event happened in Australia where Aboriginal children, sometimes referred to as the [[Stolen Generation]], were removed from their families and placed into internment camps, orphanages and other institutions.

====In Australia====
A similar period of [[forced adoption in Australia|forced adoption]], also known as the "White Stolen Generations", also occurred in Australia. It is generally understood that a decline of adoption during the 1970s was linked to a 1973 law providing for financial assistance to single parents.&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Paper No. 366, Standing Committee on Social Issues, Report on Adoption Practices, Second Interim Report, Transcripts of Evidence, 16 June 1999 – 25 October 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bell  Memorial''', also known as the '''Bell Monument''' and '''Telephone Monument''', is a memorial designed by [[Walter Seymour Allward]] to commemorate the [[invention of the telephone]] by [[Alexander Graham Bell]] at the [[Bell Homestead National Historic Site]], in [[Brantford, Ontario]], [[Canada]].

In 1906, the citizens of the Brantford and [[County of Brant|Brant County]] areas formed the Bell Telephone Memorial Association, which commissioned the memorial. By 1908, the association's designs committee asked sculptors on two continents to submit proposals for the memorial. The submission by Canadian sculptor [[Walter Seymour Allward]] of [[Toronto]] won the competition. The memorial was originally scheduled for completion by 1912 but Allward, aided by his studio assistant [[Emanuel Hahn]] did not finish it until five years later. The [[Governor General of Canada]], [[Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire]], unveiled the memorial on 24 October 1917.

Allward designed the monument to symbolize the telephone's ability to overcome great distances. A series of steps lead to the main section where the floating allegorical figure of ''Inspiration'' appears over a reclining male figure representing ''Man, transmitting sound through space'', discovering his power to transmit sound through space, and also pointing to three floating figures, the messengers of ''Knowledge'', ''Joy'', and ''Sorrow'' positioned at the other end of the tableau. Additionally, there are two female figures mounted on granite pedestals representing ''Humanity'' positioned to the left and right of the memorial, one sending and the other receiving a message.

The Bell Memorial has been described as the finest example of Allward's early work. The memorial itself has been used as a central fixture for many civic events and remains an important part of Brantford's history. It was provided a heritage designation under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]'' in 2005 and listed on the [[Canadian Register of Historic Places]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=10785 |title=Bell Monument |publisher=

== History ==

[[Alexander Graham Bell]] conceived the technical aspects of the telephone and [[Invention of the telephone|invented it]] in July 1874, while residing with his parents at their farm, Melville House, now a [[National Historic Site of Canada]].{{sfn|Bruce|1990|pp=122-123}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Patten |first=William |title=Pioneering the Telephone in Canada |year=1926 |location=Montreal| publisher=Herald Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Melville House, a name created by Alexander Melville Bell on his stationary, was at the time part of Tutelo Heights on the outskirts of the City of Brantford, but which was later incorporated within the city.|group="Note"}} One of the first successful voice transmissions of any notable distance was made on 4 August 1876, between the telegraph office in Brantford, Ontario and Bell's father's homestead over makeshift wires.{{sfn|MacLeod|1999|p=14-18}} He later refined the telephone's design at Brantford after producing his first working prototype in [[Boston]].{{sfn|MacLeod|1999|p=14}} Canada's first telephone factory, created by [[Thomas Cowherd#Earliest telephone production|James Cowherd]], was located in Brantford, and operated from about 1879 to 1881 leading to the informal designation as ''The Telephone City''.{{sfn|Sharpe|1998|p=80}}

===Memorial association established===

Discussion of a monument to commemorate both Bell and his invention was first raised in Brantford in 1904 although the Bell Telephone Memorial Association was not formally established until 1906. After gaining Bell's approval, the association and its proposed memorial were publicly endorsed on 9 March 1906 at a banquet in Brantford Kirby House (later to become the Hotel Kirby), which Bell attended as a guest of honour.&lt;ref name="BEX-1947.05.03" /&gt; That same year the association was formally organized and incorporated by an Act of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Legislature of Ontario]] with the stated aim of commemorating the invention of the telephone in Brantford and to name Bell as its inventor.&lt;ref name="Whitaker"&gt;{{citation |last=Whitaker |first=A.J. |title=Bell Telephone Memorial and Bell Homestead |url=http://www.telephonetribute.com/pdf/bell_memorial_booklet.pdf |publisher=City of Brantford/Hurley Printing |year=1944 |location=Brantford, Ontario|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was highly unusual in this instance was the building of an important monument to a living person, an event usually conducted only for imperial leaders.&lt;ref name="SanJoseEN-1907.11.01" /&gt; The duality of the monument with its dedication to both the inventor and to his invention, with its emphasis on the latter, likely persuaded Alexander Graham Bell, normally modest, to accept the invitation to its public unveiling.&lt;ref name="BEX-1975.05.01"&gt;{{cite news |title=How Citizens Built the Bell Memorial 58 Years Ago |work=Brantford Expositor |date=1975-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association was organized with the support of [[King George V|George, Prince of Wales]] (later King George V), [[Viceroy of India]] and former Governor-General of Canada [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto]], and the latter's successor Governor-General [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey]], plus an approximate dozen other prominent leaders in Canada and the United States, who endorsed the project with their backing.&lt;ref name="Whitaker" /&gt; [[Donald Howard, 3rd Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal]] became its first honorary president and upon his death, he was succeeded by the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], a former Governor-General of Canada.&lt;ref name="Expositor" /&gt; [[William Foster Cockshutt]], the local federal [[Member of Parliament (Canada)|Member of Parliament]] who had originally proposed the memorial in 1904, became the association's president, and was assisted by another MP, [[Lloyd Harris (politician)|Lloyd Harris]], who served as vice-president.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Muir |first=Gary |url=http://brantford.library.on.ca/localhistory/pdfs/cockshuttfamily.pdf |title=Bits and Pieces of Brantford's History: The History of the Cockshutt Family |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The assosation members are itentified as W.F.

The Association's public appeal quickly raised {{CA$|35000}} within its first months, rising to $44,000 by September 1909, eventually collecting over $65,000  through donations from various citizens worldwide.&lt;ref name="BEX-1909.09.29" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BEX-1916-07-18"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Bell Memorial |work=Brantford Expositor |date=1916-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional federal contribution of $10,000 was supported in Canada's parliament by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Wilfrid Laurier|Sir Wilfrid Laurier]].&lt;ref name="SanJoseEN-1907.11.01"&gt;{{cite news |title=Monument Proposed to Inventor of the Telephone: Unusual Honor |work=San Jose Evening News |date=1907-11-01 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Telephone's Birth Memorial |work=Poverty Bay Herald' |volume=XXXIV |issue=10963 |date=1907-04-01 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| Other significant contributions were made by the 'American Telephone Company' of Boston (possibly referring to the head of the [[Bell System]], [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T Corp.]] – $1,000), Col.

=== Selection committee choice ===
[[File:Bell Memorial concept drawing -c.1909.jpg|thumb|right|An '''early concept drawing''' of the memorial and the Alexander Graham Bell Gardens, c.1909.]]

Invitations were sent out to 22 sculptors in Europe, the United States and Canada in 1908, inviting them to submit models for the proposed monument.&lt;ref name="Expositor-2010.07.26"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ruby |first=Michelle |url=http://www.brantfordexpositor.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2685265 |title=Bell Homestead: Descendants On Hand To Mark Centennial |work=Brantford Expositor |date=2010-07-26 |accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1909 either nine or ten models had been submitted.{{#tag:ref|The Whitaker booklet states nine models,&lt;ref name="Whitaker" /&gt; while Elgin-Balfour writes that ten models were submitted to the committee.&lt;ref name="Elgin-Balfour"&gt;{{citation |publisher=Elgin-Balfour Foundation |url=http://www3.brantford.ca/inventory.nsf/e6a90eb030f9a3d485256cfe006dc8bf/5e7fc98d512c1dc185256a8b0058610b/$FILE/The%20Sampler%20on%20Bell%20Memorial.doc |title=The Sampler A Book About Brantford |year=1977 |pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the competition's completion, five of the plaster models where deposited at the [[Bell Homestead National Historic Site|Bell Homestead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bell Homestead |work=Brantford Courier |date=1911-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} A designs committee was appointed by the association and selected the three best designs they favored from the models submitted. The committee asked a trio of outside judges, Sir [[Byron Edmund Walker]] of the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]] in Toronto, New York State Senator [[George Allen Davis]] of Buffalo and Sir George Christie Gibbons of London, Ontario to make a final decision, all of whom were considered patrons of the arts.&lt;ref name="Whitaker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Expositor"&gt;{{citation|last=Marquis |first=T.G. |url=http://brantford.library.on.ca/localhistory/pdfs/1909expositor.pdf |title=Brantford, The Telephone City |work=The Greater Brantford Expositor |year=1909 |pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After consideration a unanimous choice was made to award the commission to [[Walter Seymour Allward]].{{#tag:ref|The committee's second and third choices were for the designs submitted by [[George William Hill (sculptor)|G.W.

Walker had earlier contacted a prominent Brantford banker, praising Allward's previous works, and advised him that "because of the national character of the work I am particularly interested in the best possible outcome artistically".&lt;ref name="Marshall.thesis"&gt;{{citation |last=Marshall |first=Barbara Ruth |url=http://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/34424/UBC_1971_A8%20M37.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Sir Edmond Walker, Servant of Canada |publisher=University of British Columbia |date=June 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lengthy delays and completion ===

The commission award for the memorial had been made in 1908 and a contract to Allward authorized in 1909, based on an initial cost estimate of $25,000 with the provision that the work would be completed by 1912.&lt;ref name="BEX-1916-07-18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BEX-1909.09.29"&gt;"Bell Memorial Plans", ''[[Brantford Expositor]]'', 29 September 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1909 the association purchased [[Alexander Melville Bell]]'s former homestead and farm, Melvile House, and transferred its ownership to the City of Brantford for conversion into a museum.&lt;ref name="BEX-1947.05.03"&gt;"Bell Memorial Committee Set Up Here In 1906", ''[[Brantford Expositor]]'', 3 May 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bell Memorial Beautiful Tribute to Telephone And Its Noted Inventor, Alexander Graham Bell  |work=Brantford Expositor |date=1926-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allward was assisted by his studio assistant, [[Emanuel Hahn|Emanuel Otto Hahn]], another highly notable sculptor who worked on the monument with him until 1912 when Hahn left for the [[Ontario College of Art]]. The project proceeded slowly in part due to Allward's concurrent work on several other commissions at the same time, including the [[South African War Memorial (Toronto)|South African War Memorial]], a major monument erected in Toronto. In April 1915 Allward reported to the committee that the two heroic figures to be mounted on pedestals had been successfully cast and that foundation work for the site had been tendered. But in regards to the central bronze casting, which was to become the largest ever created in North America up to that point,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fine Monuments Perpetuate Glorious Memories |work=Brantford Expositor |date=1937-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; he could not estimate when it would be complete, writing in a letter "I am giving all my time to it; I cannot do more. It is an important panel and cannot be too well done".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bell Memorial Directors Met: Reports Were Received On Progress of Work But Date of Unveiling is Not Yet Fixed |work=Brantford Expositor |date=1915-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For various reasons the memorial was not completed until 1917, with [[World War I]], material shortages, an embargo on exports of French moulding sand and transportation limitations creating lengthy delays.&lt;ref name="BEX-1916-07-18" /&gt;

=== Unveiling of the Memorial ===
[[File:Unveiling of the Bell Telephone Memorial, October 24, 1917, in Brantford, Ontario Canada.jpg|thumb|right|The unveiling of the Bell Memorial in October 1917, with Bell and dignitaries.]]
The Brantford monument was finally unveiled in a driving rain on 24 October 1917 by then Governor General of Canada [[Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire]] before an audience in the thousands.&lt;ref name="Unveiling" /&gt;{{sfn|McMeal|1917|p=21}} The Governor General of Canada arrived in the city by train, along with the [[Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario]] Sir [[John Strathearn Hendrie|John Hendrie]], the Hon. Senator Robertson of the [[Privy Council]], the Hon. W.D. McPherson of the [[Government of Ontario|Ontario Government]] and other notables. They were greeted by a children's chorus, honour guards, the band of the [[125th (Brantford) Battalion]] and the chimes of Grace Anglican Church located only a few dozen metres from the memorial. Also in attendance in full war regalia was Chief A.R. Hill of the [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation|Six Nations Tribes of the Grand River]], where Bell, not long after his arrival in Canada, had been made an honorary tribal chief.{{#tag:ref|Not long after the extended Bell family arrived in Canada, Alexander Graham discovered the [[Six Nations 40, Ontario|Six Nations Reserve]] across the river at [[Onondaga (village)|Onondaga]], where he learned the [[Mohawk language]] and translated its unwritten vocabulary into [[Visible Speech]] symbols. For his work, Bell was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donned a [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] headdress and performed traditional dances.{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=35}}|group="Note"}}

[[File:Bell family at memorial with Bell Mem Assoc.jpg|thumb|left|Bell in centre, with committee members, his granddaughter, [[Mabel Harlakenden Grosvenor]]; his wife, [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard|Mabel Hubbard]]; and his eldest daughter Elsie.]]

As a public holiday had been declared for the unveiling, the city's normal activities were shut down for the entire day.&lt;ref name="Globe-1917.10.26"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Globe |title=Inventor of the Telephone Upholds Brantford's Claim |date=1917-10-25 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Governor-General completed his address at the monument and unveiled its shrouds, he withdrew to the city's Old Opera House due to the driving rain, along with large numbers of the crowd. The ceremonies were continued indoors in the city's opera theatre, with Bell addressing the audience again twice more at both the opera house and during a formal reception meal held at the Kerby House. Others spoke with Bell, including his former associate from the [[Aerial Experiment Association]], [[J.A.D. McCurdy]], [[Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor|Gilbert Grosvenour]], president of the [[National Geographic Society]], and other dignitaries.&lt;ref name="Unveiling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Globe-1917.10.26" /&gt;

Alexander Graham Bell (in both of his addresses that day) reminded the attendees that "Brantford is right in claiming the invention of the telephone here... [which was] conceived in Brantford in 1874 and born in Boston in 1875",{{sfn|Bruce|1990|pp=482–483}} and later addressing the Duke, said "...on behalf of the Association ...in presenting to His Excellency [with] a silver telephone...

== Memorial ==

At the time of its unveiling, the memorial was one of the most impressive monuments of the day in Canada, designed to depict the vast distances on the Earth being "annihilated" by the telephone. The allegorical style of the monument's figures depicts several aspects of the telephone in its worldwide use. Its most striking feature is its broad, main bronze cast panel, approximately seven and a half metres wide and two and a half metres high, which portray "....the elusive dream of the inventor's youth—Inspiration whispering to Man, his power to transmit sound through space.{{#tag:ref|The bronze tableau contains three figures in [[Relief|''alto-rilievo relief'']] and measures approximately 773 centimetres in width by 250 centimetres in height.  According to documents, its casting process 'taxed' the existing foundry capabilities of the era.
|group="Note"}} Three ephemeral ghostly figures, two of which are cast in mid-relief and one in [[Relief|high (''alto-rilievo'') relief]], depict ''Knowledge, Joy'' and ''Sorrow'', transmitted to man by the telephone. Two heroic figures flanking the broad flight of steps leading up to the monument symbolize humanity sending and receiving a message."&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, E.T. [http://brantford.library.on.ca/localhistory/pdfs/telephonecity.pdf Brantford, The Telephone City], Brantford War Memorial Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Memorial is located within the Bell Memorial Gardens of Bell Memorial Park at 41 West Street in the City of Brantford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brantford.ca/residents/leisurerecreation/parkstrails/parks/Pages/BellMemorialPark.aspx |title=Bell Memorial Park |publisher=Brantford.ca |date=1917-10-24 |accessdate=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument itself is located on a gore of land forming a near-triangularly shaped public park. The triangular plot of land in front of the monument was transformed into a park, with its embankments being sodded. The panel in front of the gore which contains the monument is a smaller gore which has been artistically laid out as a park, the entire area being named as the Bell Memorial Gardens.&lt;ref name="Whitaker" /&gt;

=== The model of ''Man, transmitting sound through space'' ===

[[File:Bell Telephone Memorial, Alexander Graham Bell Park, Brantford, Ontario, Canada - IMG 0387.JPG|thumb|right|'''Allegorical 'Inspiration' and 'Man', communicating''', with the vastness of the Earth depicted by the curvatures on its cast bronze panel.]]

The model for'' 'Man, discovering his power to transmit sound through space','' was Cyril William George Kinsella a wounded war veteran and a former resident of [[Brantford]].&lt;ref name="Unveiling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Expositor-2009.12.27" /&gt;  Kinsella served as Allward's nude model representing Man after being severely injured in the European conflict.&lt;ref name="Allward"&gt;{{citation |last=Allward |first=W.S. |url=http://www3.brantford.ca/inventory.nsf/e6a90eb030f9a3d485256cfe006dc8bf/5e7fc98d512c1dc185256a8b0058610b/$FILE/WSAllward%20on%20bell%20memorial.doc |title=Sketch-Model No.8: Description to Accompany Sketch Model of Proposed Bell Telephone Memorial |accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in the UK he had become one of approximately 100,000 disadvantaged British children and orphans, a "[[Home Children|Home Child]]",  sent to Canada and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]] to find better lives in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After arriving in Ontario in 1908 he resided in a series of Fegan Homes (named after James William Condell Fegan of Britain), including one in Toronto where he likely later met Allward. Kinsella eventually settled in Brantford County to perform farmwork. Underaged, but a healthy {{convert|178|cm|ftin}} in height in 1914, he enlisted in Brantford's 125th Battalion for service overseas where he fought in Belgium and France with the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] during World War I.&lt;ref name="Expositor-2009.12.27" /&gt;

Kinsella was wounded and shell-shocked at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] in [[Belgium]] and, after being invalided and discharged back to Canada in 1916, met Allward in Toronto while convalescing and then worked as his model, saying later "The posing was exacting and took about two months."&lt;ref name="BX-1946.05.04" /&gt; Kinsella subsequently became bored with civilian life and reenlisted with the Canadian Army, returning to Europe. He was serving with the [[1st Canadian Division]], [[4th Battalion (Central Ontario), CEF|Fourth Battalion]] near the northern French village of St. Marie Chappell at the time of the memorial's unveiling in Brantford. He later returned to Canada at the end of the war, but did not view himself on the memorial until 27 years later, in May 1946.&lt;ref name="Expositor-2009.12.27"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ball |first=Vincent |url=http://www.brantfordexpositor.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2237256 |title=The Industrialist, The Architect And The Home Boy |work=Brantford Expositor |date=2009-12-27 |accessdate=2012-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BX-1946.05.04"&gt;{{citation|work=Brantford Expositor |title=War Veteran Sees For First Time The Bell Memorial Figure He Had Posed For |date=1946-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other monument features ===

At the memorial's crest is a series of steps leading to the main portion of the monument, a wide mass of white Stanstead granite, faced by the largest single [[Lost-wax casting|bronze casting]] created up to that time, which taxed the capacity of its foundry. The sculptor sought to bring out, as the dominant note, the discovery by man of his power to transmit sound through space. Above the reclining figure of man is ''Inspiration'',{{#tag:ref|Most literature refers to this figure as ''Inspiration'', however in an explanation of the complex allegories by Sir Edmund Walker, he named the figure surmounting ''Man, discovering his power to transmit vocal sounds through space'' as ''Intelligence''.&lt;ref name="Marshall.thesis" /&gt;|group="Note"}} urging him on to greater endeavors, while, at the other end of the panel are the messengers of ''Knowledge'', ''Joy'' and ''Sorrow'', communicating to man by telephone. On both sides of the main portion of the monument are two "heroic" female figures representing humanity in bronze on granite mounts, one depicted in the act of sending, the other of receiving a message over the telephone. The two female figures were positioned some distance apart in order to denote the telephone's power to traverse great distances. Uniting the entire work together is the line of the earth's curvature on the bronze casting, depicting the extent of the telephone's worldwide use.&lt;ref name="Historica" /&gt; Allward's original proposed design for the monument also included the flags of the greatest nations of the world,&lt;ref name="Allward" /&gt; a modern element that was likely omitted as it would detract from the monument's neoclassical design.

The rear side of the monument contains a small stone foundation with bullfrog [[gargoyle]]s; while cut in the stone, on pilasters, are representations of the [[British Crown]] and the [[Maple leaf|Maple Leaf]]. On the rear, also, was placed a bronze plaque giving the names of the patrons and the executive committee of the Association. In the present day the plaque is now found on the side of the rightmost granite mount for one of the heroic figures. The foundation, steps, pedestals and walls are composed of durable Stanstead granite.&lt;ref name="Whitaker" /&gt; On the main portion, to the right and left, two circular panels are inscribed: "''Hoc Opus Machinae Patri Dedicatum Est''" (this monument has been dedicated to the author of the invention) and "''Mundus Telephonici Usu Recreatus Est.''" (the world has been recreated using the telephone).&lt;ref name="Unveiling"&gt;Brant Historical Society.

"Onlooker at Bell Unveiling", ''[[Brantford Expositor]]'', 6 March 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;  The monument also launched its designer-sculptor to fame.

== Reception ==
[[File:Bell Telephone Memorial, Alexander Graham Bell Park, Brantford, Ontario, Canada IMG 0417 18.JPG|thumb|right|Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada plaque added in 2010 honouring Allward's work.]]

Allward's memorial has been described as "a tour de force".&lt;ref name="BEX-1936-08-10" /&gt;  One resident described the imagery of the oversized figures on its bronze panel, saying that it  "...depicts a mythical passing of the spark of communication from the hands of the gods to the hands of humans".&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Gil.  ''Nothing On But the Radio: A Look Back at Radio in Canada and How It Changed the World'', Dundurn, 2003, p. 22, {{ISBN|1550029924}}, {{ISBN|978-1550029925}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial has served as an important gathering point, landmark and commemoration site for Brantford, used to rally people for fund-raising events, marches and civic events. At the [[World War I#Armistices and capitulations|Armistice of World War I]], it became a spontaneous gathering point for celebration. It was also used to help raise funds for Brantford's First World War Cenotaph, another of Walter Allward's works.&lt;ref name="Expositor-2010.07.26" /&gt;

The memorial received historical designation for its cultural heritage value, by the City of Brantford on 31 October 2005, under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.&lt;ref name="Historica"&gt;[http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=10785 Bell Monument], HistoricPlaces.ca website, retrieved 27 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also designated and listed on the [[Canadian Register of Historic Places]] on 12 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=10785 |title=HistoricPlaces.ca |publisher=HistoricPlaces.ca |date=2005-10-31 |accessdate=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 both [[Parks Canada]] and the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada celebrated Allward's work by affixing a plaque to the monument honouring the sculptor himself.  It noted Allward's designation as a person of national historic significance due to his "...original sense of spatial composition, his mastery of the classical form and his brilliant craftsmanship."&lt;ref name="CP-2010.08.16"&gt;"Cdn Sculptor Walter Seymour Allward Honoured For His Public Monuments", [[The Canadian Press|''Canadian Press'']], 16 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregorio Zaide's primary and secondary education were in [[Spanish language]], when it was the social language of the Philippines.  He graduated [[valedictorian]] from Laguna High School (now called the ''Pedro Guevara Memorial National High School'') in [[Santa Cruz, Laguna]] in 1926.

IMDB.com. Retrieved on 2013-06-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the first [[Professor emeritus]] of History at the [[Far Eastern University]] after he retired in 1964.

==Legacy==
The earliest editions of Zaide's books were standard texts studied by students during the Philippines' immediate post-WWII period,&lt;ref name="Claudio2005"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=TwglDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17&amp;lpg=PR17&amp;dq=The+History+Textbook+as+a+Story+of+Generations&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oSu2xikrpi&amp;sig=JebVOZmbwFJ5b_mA-p-nHmmYZvY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= The History Textbook as a Story of Generations |last= Claudio, |first= Lisandro  |date= |work=State and Society in the Philippines |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |year=2005 | isbn= |editor-last= Abinales|editor-first= Patricio N.|editor2-last= Amoroso |editor2-first= Donna J.|edition= |volume= |location=Maryland |pages=|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became very influential because of their influence on the education of first generation after Philippine independence,&lt;ref name="Dalisay2015"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.philstar.com/arts-and-culture/2015/10/12/1509206/history-made-personal |title=History Made Personal |last=Dalisay |first=Butch |date=2015-10-12 |work=The Philippine Star |access-date=2017-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204005745/http://www.philstar.com/arts-and-culture/2015/10/12/1509206/history-made-personal |archive-date=2015-12-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and because some of these books continue to be released in updated editions.&lt;ref name="MorrisShimazuVickers2014"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=_DUsAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240&amp;dq=zaide+textbook&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T6KdDCd0ei&amp;sig=TdhhAHzcnu1Iuy-CNodL_LnFOk4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=zaide%2520textbook&amp;f=false |title=Imagining Japan in Post-war East Asia: Identity Politics, Schooling and Popular Culture |last=Morris |first=Paul |last2=Shimazu |first2=Naoko |last3=Vickers |first3=Edward |date=2014-03-26 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134684908 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zaide's historical works are generally known for their lively prose&lt;ref name="Dalisay2015" /&gt; - with Palanca laureate [[Butch Dalisay]] noting that his works were "''as fascinating to &lt;nowiki&gt;[him]&lt;/nowiki&gt; as a boy as any of Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Martian chronicles.''"&lt;ref name="Dalisay2015" /&gt;  In the same breath, however, these works are criticized as lacking in "''the important qualifications and nuances to be made to telling the story of our past, such as the fact that histories unavoidably took sides, and that it was all too easy to be seduced into taking the wrong one.''"&lt;ref name="Dalisay2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MorrisShimazuVickers2014" /&gt;

In particular, Zaide has been criticized for portraying history in a way that put the Philippines' colonial experience under the Spanish and the Americans in an over-simplistically positive light.&lt;ref name="Claudio2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MorrisShimazuVickers2014" /&gt;

Historian [[Ambeth Ocampo]] has noted that this "old-fashioned" style and perspective was simply reflective of historians of Zaide's generation, noting:&lt;ref name="AmbethOcampo20150218"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/82663/not-just-gomburza |title=Not just Gomburza |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth R. |date=2015-02-18 |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |access-date=2017-09-06 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"''Zaide may be old-fashioned to a generation that grew up with the works of nationalist historians [[Teodoro A. Agoncillo]] and [[Renato Constantino]], but I have always appreciated his two-volume work &lt;nowiki&gt;[“The Pageant of Philippine History”]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. One may not find Zaide’s writing style or viewpoint to one’s taste, but in his footnotes he gives the interested reader the leads to follow up on in the primary sources.''"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Major works==
Zaide was a prolific writer and historian writing about 67 books, which were adopted as textbooks for high schools and colleges.&lt;ref name="AmbethOcampo20150218"/&gt; He also authored more than 500 articles in history published in both national and international newspapers and academic journals.

Among his contributions to Philippine history are the following books:&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/authors/OL212698A/Gregorio_F._Zaide "Gregorio F. Zaide"]. Open Library.org. Retrieved on 2013-06-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gustav Schoeman Preller''' (4 October 1875 in Klein Schoemansdal, Klipdrift, [[Pretoria]] – 7 October 1943 in [[Pelindaba]]) was a journalist, historian, writer and literary critic. He fought for the recognition of [[Afrikaans]]. Preller helped the [[Afrikaner]] to awake to
the importance of the history of [[South Africa]]. He made great contributions to the writing of South African history, through his research and the literature. He also contributed greatly to making South Africans aware of the legacy of the [[Voortrekkers]] and also played an
early part in planning the [[Voortrekker Monument]].

==Background==
Gustav was the son of Comdt. Robert Logie Preller and Stefina Schoeman (daughter of the [[Voortrekker]] Gen. [[Stephanus Schoeman]]). His parents farmed near [[Standerton]] where he attended school for only 3 years.&lt;ref name="Hofmeyr"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hofmeyr, Isabel | title=Popularizing History: The Case of Gustav Preller  |journal=The Journal of African History |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=521–535 |jstor= 182354 |date=1988 |registration=yes |doi=10.1017/s0021853700030607}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|524}} Later he worked in Pretoria as a shop-assistant, an articled clerk and a civil servant, studying diligently when he found the time.&lt;ref name=Hofmeyr/&gt;{{rp|524}} When the [[Boer War]] started, he was working as a clerk for the Department of Mines and would marry Johanna, the granddaughter of M. W. Pretorius (i.e. 'Swart Martiens', the cousin of [[Marthinus Wessel Pretorius|M. W. Pretorius]]) and Deborah Retief, in 1898.&lt;ref name=Hofmeyr/&gt;{{rp|524}}

During the Anglo-Boer War, he was part of the Pretoria Commando serving in the artillery but was captured at [[Ermelo]] and sent to [[India]] as a prisoner of war.&lt;ref name=Hofmeyr/&gt;{{rp|524}}&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;{{rp|130}} On his return to the [[Transvaal Colony]] in 1902 at the end of the war, there was no job for him at the Department of Mines and he considered emigrating to Argentina, but was offered the editorship of ''Land en Volk''.&lt;ref name=Hofmeyr/&gt;{{rp|524}} By 1903 he was editor of ''De Volkstem'', the mouthpiece of [[Louis Botha|Louis Botha's]] future party, ''[[Het Volk (political party)|Het Volk]]''.&lt;ref name=Hofmeyr/&gt;{{rp|524}} He increased the circulation from 2,000 to 20,000.&lt;ref name=Hofmeyr/&gt;{{rp|525}}

As a supporter of Louis Botha, he became a [[South African Party]] member from its creation in 1910 with the formation of the [[Union of South Africa]].He was a [[Freemasonry in South Africa |South African Freemason]].|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freemason.org.za/Vertel%20my%20van.htm |title=(Afrikaans) Vertel my van vrymesselary (Translated: tell me about freemasonry)|author=Zaayman, V.|accessdate=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was editor of ''[[Die Brandwag]]'' magazine from 1910 until 1922.&lt;ref name=Hofmeyr/&gt;{{rp|524}} After the death of Botha in 1919 his loyalty wavered and he joined the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] in 1925.&lt;ref name=Hofmeyr/&gt;{{rp|524}} He became editor of the party's mouthpiece, ''Ons Vaderland''.&lt;ref name=Hofmeyr/&gt;{{rp|524}} During the period of his various editorships, he conducted historical research into the histories of the Boers in Natal and the Transvaal and the [[Great Trek]] and Anglo-Boer wars.&lt;ref name=Hofmeyr/&gt;{{rp|525}} In 1936, Preller was appointed as the state historian, which position he held until his death.&lt;ref name=Hofmeyr/&gt;{{rp|525}}

There are numerous surviving ancient Greek and Latin sources on '''[[Alexander the Great]]''', king of [[Macedon]], as well as some oriental texts.  The five main surviving accounts are by Arrian, Plutarch, Diodorus, Curtius and Justin.&lt;ref name = grxxii&gt;Green, 2007, pp xxii–xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these five main sources, there is the ''[[Metz Epitome]]'', an anonymous late Latin work that narrates Alexander's campaigns from [[Hyrcania]] to [[India]].  Much is also recounted incidentally by other authors, including [[Strabo]], [[Athenaeus]], [[Polyaenus]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], and others.  Strabo, who gives a summary of Callisthenes, is an important source for Alexander's journey 
to [[Siwa Oasis|Siwah]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartledge, P., ''Alexander the Great'' (Vintage Books, 2004), p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary sources==
The primary sources written by people who actually knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander, are all lost, apart from a few inscriptions and fragments.&lt;ref name = grxxii/&gt; Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life include Alexander's campaign historian [[Callisthenes]]; Alexander's generals [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Nearchus]]; [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia|Aristobulus]], a junior officer on the campaigns; and [[Onesicritus]], Alexander's chief helmsman.&lt;ref name = grxxii/&gt; Finally, there is the very influential account of [[Cleitarchus]] who, while not a direct witness of Alexander's expedition, used sources which had just been published.&lt;ref name = grxxii/&gt; His work was to be the backbone of that of [[Timagenes]], who heavily influenced many historians whose work still survives. None of his works survived, but we do have later works based on these primary sources.&lt;ref name = grxxii/&gt;

==The five main sources==

===Arrian===
*''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' (''The Campaigns of Alexander'' in Greek) by the Greek historian [[Arrian]] of [[Nicomedia]], writing in the 2nd century AD, and based largely on Ptolemy and, to a lesser extent, Aristobulus and Nearchus. It is generally considered one of the best sources on the campaigns of Alexander as well as one of the founders of a primarily military-based focus on history. Arrian cites his source by name and he often criticizes them. He is not interested in the King's private life, overlooking his errors .  ''That Alexander should have committed errors in conduct from impetuosity or from wrath, and that he should have been induced to comport himself like the Persian monarchs to an immoderate degree, I do not think remarkable if we fairly consider both his youth and his uninterrupted career of good fortune. I do not think that even his tracing his origin to a god was a great error on Alexander's part, if it was not perhaps merely a device to induce his subjects to show him reverence''. (Arrian 7b 29)
*''Indike''

===Plutarch===
*''Life of Alexander'' (see ''[[Parallel Lives]]'') and two orations ''On the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander the Great'' (see ''[[Moralia]]''), by the Greek historian and biographer [[Plutarch]] of [[Chaeronea]] in the second century, based largely on Aristobulus and especially Cleitarchus. Plutarch devotes a great deal of space to Alexander's drive and desire, and strives to determine how much of it was presaged in his youth.  He also draws extensively on the work of [[Lysippus]], Alexander's favourite sculptor, to provide what is probably the fullest and most accurate description of the conqueror's physical appearance.

===Diodorus===
*''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' (''Library of world history''), written in Greek by the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], from which Book 17 relates the conquests of Alexander, based almost entirely on Cleitarchus and Hieronymus of Cardia. It is the oldest surviving Greek source (1st century BC). Diodorus regarded Alexander like Caesar as a key historical figure and chronological marker.

===Curtius===
*''Historiae Alexandri Magni'', a biography of Alexander in ten books, of which the last eight survive, by the Roman historian [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]], written in the 1st century AD, and based largely on Cleitarchus through the mediation of Timagenes, with some material probably from Ptolemy.  His work is fluidly written, but reveals ignorance of geography, chronology and technical military knowledge, focusing instead on character. According to [[Jona Lendering]]: ''..the real subject was not Alexander, but the tyranny of [[Tiberius]] and [[Caligula]]. (It can be shown that Curtius Rufus' description of the trial of [[Philotas]] is based on an incident during the reign of Tiberius)...Curtius copies Cleitarchus' mistakes, although he is not an uncritical imitator.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/curtius/qcr.html Curtius – livius.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justin===
*The ''Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus'' by [[Junianus Justinus|Justin]], is highly compressed version of an earlier history by [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Trogus]], with the selections governed by Justin's desire to make moralistic points, rather than with an eye for the history itself.&lt;ref name = grxxii/&gt;

His and subsequent finds, all from the [[Mount Stephen]] area, came to the attention of [[palaeontologist]] [[Charles Doolittle Walcott]], who in 1907 found time to reconnoitre the area. He opened a quarry in 1910 and in a series of field trips brought back 65,000 specimens, which he identified as Middle [[Cambrian]] in [[geologic timescale|age]]. Due to the quantity of fossils and the pressures of his other duties at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], Walcott was only able to publish a series of "preliminary" papers, in which he classified the fossils within [[taxon|taxa]] that were already established. In a series of visits beginning in 1924, Harvard University professor [[Percy Raymond]] collected further fossils from Walcott's quarry and higher up on Fossil Ridge, where slightly different fossils were preserved.

Interest in the area's fossil beds faded after Raymond's 1930s expeditions. In the early 1960s [[Harry B. Whittington]] was persuaded that further investigation was required, and organised surveys in partnership with the [[Geological Survey of Canada]]. These new specimens led him to set up a team to re-examine Walcott's fossils, which had languished in a store-room at the Smithsonian since Walcott's death in 1927. In the early 1970s the team published papers that diagnosed many of the specimens as fossils of previously unknown types of animals, some possibly belonging to new [[phylum|phyla]]. These analyses heightened interest in the existing debate about whether the [[Cambrian explosion]] represented a truly abrupt evolution of recognisable animals or was the result of a longer development, most of which was hidden by gaps in the known sets of fossils that had been found.

All this time no Canadian museum had its own collection of Burgess Shale fossils. In 1975 the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] (ROM) began collecting, found 7,750 new specimens around the existing sites, and discovered similar fossil beds up to {{convert|40|km|mi}} away. Their collection currently stands at 140,000 specimens and growing, and the rate at which new species are found suggests that the Burgess Shale will continue to produce important discoveries for the foreseeable future.

The richness of fossils in the Field area was first identified by workers associated with the construction of the Trans-Canada railway, which had (somewhat controversially) been routed through the Kicking Horse valley.&lt;ref name=Collins2009-2&gt;{{Walcott 2009|collins-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard McConnell, of the Geological Survey of Canada, was mapping the geology around the railway line in September 1886, and was pointed to the [[Mount Stephen trilobite beds]] by a construction worker.&lt;ref name=Collins2009&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = D.| title = Misadventures in the Burgess Shale| journal = Nature| volume = 460| issue = 7258| last1 = Collins| pages = 952–953| date=Aug 2009 | issn = 0028-0836| pmid = 19693066| doi = 10.1038/460952a       |bibcode = 2009Natur.460..952C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several unusual fossils were subsequently described from this site, including sponges, worms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|last=Matthew|volume=5|pages=39–68|first=G.F.|title=Studies on Cambrian Faunas, No. 3.&amp;mdash;Upper Cambrian Fauna, Mount Stephen, British Columbia.&amp;mdash;The Trilobites and Worms|year=1899}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the appendages of the unusual ''Anomalocaris'', identified at that time as the bodies of crabs.&lt;ref name=Whiteaves1892&gt;{{cite journal|title=Description of a new genus and species of Phyllocarid crustacean from the Middle Cambrian of Mount Stephen, B.C.|last=Whiteaves| first=J.F.| date=October 1892|volume=5|issue=4|journal=The Canadian Record of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these fossils found their way to Charles Doolittle Walcott, who described them and correctly estimated their Middle Cambrian age. These fossils whetted Walcott's appetite for the region, but it was not until 1907 that the opportunity arose for him to visit Mount Stephen in person.&lt;ref name=Primer&gt;{{Burgess Shale Primer|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1908 saw a rich crop of publications as Walcott worked on the material he had collected the previous year, and towards the end of August 1909 he returned to the Field area. That summer, Walcott had visited England to participate in the celebration of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s centenary. Whilst there, he had met the Natural History Museum curator Henry Woodward, who had suggested that the nearby Mount Field may yield further fossils of the ilk of the Trilobite beds.&lt;ref name=Collins2009/&gt; Promptly upon his arrival in Field, Walcott ascended the slopes of Mount Field via Burgess Pass. This pass, probably one of the many constructed by the CPR in an effort to attract tourists,&lt;ref name=Yochelson1996/&gt; led along what is now called Fossil Ridge. Walcott recognised the talus material which lay across the trail as the Stephen Formation, and noticed interesting fossils. This find is often considered to be the first discovery of the Burgess Shale 'proper'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burgess-shale.info|title=Walcott 2009: Charles D. Walcott and the discovery of the Burgess Shale|year=2009|publisher=The Burgess Shale Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent several more days collecting on Fossil Ridge before returning to Mount Stephen to bolster his collections from the Trilobite Beds.&lt;ref name=Primer/&gt;

The subsequent year saw more intensive collecting by Walcott. He and his two sons systematically investigated every stratum of rock to locate the source of the block they had found the previous summer.

Walcott and his family returned to the quarry each summer until 1913, using dynamite as surface collection dried up. During this time, his wife died in a train crash and his eldest son died of tubercolosis.&lt;ref name=Primer/&gt; He considered his next trip, in 1917, to have "practically exhausted" the quarry, with 1300&amp;nbsp;kg of material being collected that year. He returned to take additional collections, mainly from talus material, in 1919, 1921, and 1924, amassing a total of 65,000 fossil specimens over 30,000 slabs.&lt;ref name=SCM1994&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, administrative duties became a growing burden on Walcott's time, and the Burgess took a back seat to the completion of his attempts to document the stratigraphy of the southern Rockies, an extensive work which he did not live to see published.&lt;ref name=Primer/&gt;

Three years before Walcott died in 1927, the Harvard University professor Percy Raymond led a group of summer-school students to Walcott's camp and quarry. These field trips became a regular fixture, and Raymond's interest in the fossils led him to obtain permission to re-open the quarry.&lt;ref name=Primer/&gt; He also determined that a level slightly further up-slope, recognised but not exploited by Walcott, bore a slightly different fauna, and opened a new quarry – now termed the Raymond Quarry – at this level.&lt;ref name=Primer/&gt;

==Renewed interest==
After Raymond's few excursions, the Burgess Shale faded somewhat into obscurity. Walcott's third wife, Mary Vaux, discouraged access to the collections, which gathered dust on high shelves in the Smithsonian Institution.&lt;ref name=Collins2009/&gt; Harry Whittington, then of Harvard University, was to prove the catalyst that renewed interest in the site. As he showed a visiting trilobite expert around Raymond's collections, the necessity of a restudy was pointed out to Whittington, who proceeded to lobby the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) to revisit the locality.&lt;ref name=Primer/&gt; They did, and as a leading authority on trilobites, Whittington was the logical choice to head the palaeontological investigations in the arthropod-rich Shale.&lt;ref name=SCM1994/&gt; In the company of Jim Aitken and Bill Fritz, he led a GSC reconnaissance expedition in 1966; fellow trilobitologist David Bruton joined the crew the next year as they went out to quarry in force.&lt;ref name=Primer/&gt; Dynamite was used in only the smallest quantities, with closely spaced drill holes used to separate large blocks of rock, and large slabs were collected systematically from the Walcott and Raymond quarries.&lt;ref name=WL/&gt; These were labelled with their stratigraphic level, helicoptered from the mountain face, and returned to Whittington's base at the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge for further study.&lt;ref name=WL/&gt; The 1967 operation resulted in the description of new animals, including the earliest known crinoid and a complete ''[[Anomalocaris]]''. Initially, detailed descriptions were made of some of the most common arthropod-like organisms: ''[[Marrella]]'', ''[[Sidneyia]]'' and ''[[Burgessia]]''.&lt;ref name=Whittington1971&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These redescriptions were slow and laborious, making extensive use of the [[camera lucida]] technique for microscope drawing, with papers based extensively around detailed drawing of the fossil specimens.&lt;ref name=SCM1994/&gt; It soon became clear that the Burgess Shale was even more exceptional than previously thought – soft tissue was preserved to an exquisite quality, allowing insights into early life that had never before been dreamed of, and preserving a range of non-mineralising taxa which are otherwise invisible in the fossil record.&lt;ref name=SCM1994/&gt; With an overwhelmingly diverse fauna in need of cataloguing, Harry Whittington set his two new graduate students to the task, assigning [[Derek Briggs]] and [[Simon Conway Morris]] the [[arthropod]]s and 'worms', respectively.&lt;ref name=WL/&gt; This work began to lift the veil on an unexpectedly diverse ecosystem, with almost as much variety as seen in the modern oceans – the old theory that Cambrian life was simple, straightforward and slightly dull disintegrated further with each new fossil described.&lt;ref name=SCM1994/&gt; This view was reinforced with the identification of other Burgess Shale-type deposits elsewhere in the world, a search for which was triggered by the discovery of the [[Chengjiang]] and [[Sirius Passet]] [[lagerstätte]]n in 1984.&lt;ref name=Primer/&gt;

In February 2014, the discovery was announced of another Burgess Shale outcrop in [[Kootenay National Park]] to the south. In just 15 days of field collecting in 2013, 50 animal species were unearthed at the new site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title ='Epic' new fossil site found in B.C. national park| newspaper =Canoe.ca| publisher =Quebecor Media| date =11 February 2014| url =http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Science/2014/02/10/21461856.html| accessdate =11 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian collections==

Until 1975, no Canadian museum had its own collection of Burgess Shale fossils. With the work of the GSC and its associates, the shale was rising to prominence, and in 1975 the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] (ROM) obtained permission from the National Parks authority, [[Parks Canada]], to collect fossils from talus material in order to develop its own display. Parks Canada would redirect other museums' requests for material to the ROM, so the 1975 collection team gathered ample specimens to meet the anticipated teaching and display requirements. As well as 7750 specimens, this expedition yielded evidence that further fossil outcrops existed up-slope, and in 1981 a five-year reconnaissance program begun. This program would unearth further sites higher on Fossil Ridge; further around the steep cliffs of Mount Stephen; and on Odaray Mountain.&lt;ref name=Primer/&gt; These sites proved very productive, bearing a different fauna and spanning more time than the original beds.&lt;ref name=Primer/&gt; Excavation by ROM crews continues to this day, and has found fossils below the base of Walcott's quarry, and some 40&amp;nbsp;km away near the Stanley Glacier. The ROM's collections now stand proud of 140,000 specimens, and is continually yielding important new species and redescriptions.&lt;ref name=Daley2009&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Daley| last2 = Budd| last3 = Caron| last4 = Edgecombe| last5 = Collins | first1 = A.

==Protection==
[[File:Burgess Shale notice.jpg|thumb|The historic Burgess Shale sites are now restricted areas.]]
In 1981, [[UNESCO]] recognised the importance of the Burgess Shale by naming it a [[World Heritage site]].&lt;ref name="Parks Canada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/bc/YOHO/natcul/natcul15_E.asp|title=The Burgess Shale: a treasure of ancient fossils|work=pc.gc.ca|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to the Fossil Ridge quarries and Trilobite beds is now possible only as part of a guided group,&lt;ref name=Primer/&gt; and the sites are under continuous surveillance by Parks Canada, with hefty fines for removing or defacing fossil material.&lt;ref name=Primer/&gt;

== Centenary ==

To mark the hundredth anniversary of Walcott's discovery of the main Burgess Shale site on Fossil Ridge, an international conference of 150 specialists in the field was held in Banff, Alberta, in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burgess-shale.info |title=Walcott 2009 – An International Conference on the Cambrian Explosion – Banff, Alberta, August 3–8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811045342/http://burgess-shale.info/ |archivedate=August 11, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured technical and keynote sessions reporting on the latest research in the field,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burgess-shale.info/program |title=Walcott 2009 International Conference on the Cambrian Explosion – Conference Schedule |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811045342/http://burgess-shale.info/program |archivedate=August 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and field hikes to the Shale itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burgess-shale.info/field-trips |title=Walcott 2009 International Conference on the Cambrian Explosion – Field trips |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811045342/http://burgess-shale.info/field-trips |archivedate=August 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sven Buelow |year = 2010 | title = Der Burgess-Schiefer &amp;ndash; Neues der Kambrischen-Explosion | journal = Fossilien | issue = 3 | volume = 2010 | pages = 141–148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kakei''' (嘉慶) was a [[Japanese era name]] (年号, ''nengō'', lit. year name) of the [[Northern Court (Japan)|Northern Court]] during the [[Nanboku-cho|Era of Northern and Southern Courts]] after [[Shitoku]] and before [[Kōō (Nanboku-chō period)|Kōō]]. This period spanned the years from August 1387 to February 1389.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Kakei''" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA455&amp;dq=  ''Japan encyclopedia'', p. 455;] n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor in Kyoto was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Komatsu]]|後小松天皇|''Go-Komatsu-tennō''}}&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP317&amp;dq= ''Annales des empereurs du japon'', pp. 317-318.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Court]] rival in Yoshino during this time-frame was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Kameyama]]|後亀山天皇|''Go-Kameyama-tennō}}.

==Nanboku-chō overview==
[[File:Nanbokucho-capitals.svg|thumb|140px|The Imperial seats during the ''Nanboku-chō'' period were in relatively close proximity, but geographically distinct. They were conventionally identified as:  {{unordered list|Northern capital : [[Kyoto]] |Southern capital : [[Yoshino, Nara|Yoshino]].}}]]   
During the [[Meiji period]], an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911 established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] through [[Emperor Go-Murakami]], whose {{nihongo|Southern Court|南朝|''nanchō''}} had been established in exile in [[Yoshino District|Yoshino]], near Nara.&lt;ref name="concise"&gt;Thomas, Julia Adeney. (2001).

(1997). ''History and the State in Nineteenth-Century Japan.'' p. 140-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of the [[Edo period]], the militarily superior pretender-Emperors supported by the [[Ashikaga shogunate]] had been mistakenly incorporated in Imperial chronologies despite the undisputed fact that the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan|Imperial Regalia]] were not in their possession.&lt;ref name="concise"/&gt;

This illegitimate {{nihongo|[[Northern Court]]|北朝|''hokuchō''}} had been established in [[Kyoto]] by [[Ashikaga Takauji]].&lt;ref name="concise"/&gt;

==Change of era==
* '''1387''', also called {{nihongo|''Kakei gannen''|嘉慶元年}}: The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in ''Shitoku'' 4.

In this time frame, [[Genchū]] (1384–1393) was the Southern Court equivalent ''nengō.''&lt;ref name="titsingh317"&gt;Titsingh, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events of the Kakei era==
* '''1387''' (''Kakei 1, 1st month''): [[Nijō Yoshimoto]] is removed from his powerful position as ''[[sesshō]]'' and ''[[daijō daijin]].''&lt;ref name="titsingh318"&gt;Titsingh, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1387''' (''Kakei 1, 2nd month''): [[Konoe Kanetsugu]] is named ''sesshō''.&lt;ref name="titsingh318"/&gt;
* '''1387-89''' (''Kakei 1–3''): Dissension develops in Toki family of [[Mino Province|Mino]].&lt;ref name="a329"&gt;Ackroyd, Joyce. (1982) ''Lessons from History: The "Tokushi Yoron"'', p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of literature by era}}
'''[[Latin]] literature''' includes the essays, histories, poems, plays, and other writings written in the [[Latin]] language.  The beginning of Latin literature dates to 240 BC, when the first stage play was performed in Rome. Latin literature would flourish for the next six centuries. The classical era of Latin literature can be roughly divided into the following periods: [[Latin_literature#Early_Latin_literature|Early Latin literature]], [[Latin_literature#The_Golden_Age|The Golden Age]], [[Latin_literature#The_Imperial_Period|The Imperial Period]] and [[Latin_literature#Latin_in_the_Middle_Ages,_Renaissance,_and_Early_Modernity|Late Antiquity]].

Latin was the language of the ancient Romans, but it was also the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of Western Europe throughout the [[Middle Ages]], so Latin literature includes not only Roman authors like [[Cicero]], [[Vergil]], [[Ovid]] and [[Horace]], but also includes European writers after the fall of the Empire, from religious writers like [[Aquinas]] (1225–1274), to secular writers like [[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626), [[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632–1677), and [[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727).

== History ==

=== Early Latin literature ===
{{Main|Old Latin}}

Formal Latin literature began in 240 BC, when a Roman audience saw a Latin version of a Greek play.&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth, George Eckel. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BuLEo5U9sb0C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The nature of Roman comedy: a study in popular entertainment.''] University of Oklahoma Press, 1994. p. 3. Web. 15 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The adaptor was [[Livius Andronicus]], a Greek who had been brought to Rome as a prisoner of war in 272 BC. Andronicus also translated Homer's Greek epic the ''Odyssey'' into an old type of Latin verse called ''Saturnian''. The first Latin poet to write on a Roman theme was [[Gnaeus Naevius]] during the 3rd century BC. He composed an epic poem about the [[first Punic War]], in which he had fought. Naevius's dramas were mainly reworkings of Greek originals, but he also created tragedies based on Roman myths and history.

Other epic poets followed Naevius. [[Quintus Ennius]] wrote a historical epic, the ''Annals'' (soon after 200 BC), describing Roman history from the founding of Rome to his own time. He adopted Greek dactylic hexameter, which became the standard verse form for Roman epics. He also became famous for his tragic dramas. In this field, his most distinguished successors were [[Marcus Pacuvius]] and [[Lucius Accius]]. These three writers rarely used episodes from Roman history. Instead, they wrote Latin versions of tragic themes that the Greeks had already handled. But even when they copied the Greeks, they did not translate slavishly. Only fragments of their plays have survived.

[[File:Marco Porcio Caton Major.jpg|thumb|70px|right|Cato the Elder]]

Considerably more is known about early Latin comedy, as 26 Early Latin comedies are extant – 20 of which [[Plautus]] wrote, and the remaining six of which [[Terence]] wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Shipley, Joseph Twadell. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Dictionary of world literature: criticism, forms, technique.''] Taylor &amp; Francis, 1964. p. 109. Web. 15 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These men modeled their comedies on Greek plays known as [[Ancient Greek comedy#New Comedy (nea)|New Comedy]]. But they treated the plots and wording of the originals freely. Plautus scattered songs through his plays and increased the humor with puns and wisecracks, plus comic actions by the actors. Terence's plays were more polite in tone, dealing with domestic situations. His works provided the chief inspiration for French and English comedies of the 17th century AD, and even for modern American comedy.

The prose of the period is best known through ''On Agriculture'' (160 BC) by [[Cato the Elder]]. Cato also wrote the first Latin history of Rome and of other Italian cities.&lt;ref&gt;Mehl, Andreas. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0W1rpowMywYC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Roman Historiography.''] Wiley-Blackwell, 2010. p 52. Web. 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first Roman statesman to put his political speeches in writing as a means of influencing public opinion.

Early Latin literature ended with [[Gaius Lucilius]], who created a new kind of poetry in his 30 books of ''Satires'' (2nd century BC). He wrote in an easy, conversational tone about books, food, friends, and current events.

=== The Golden Age ===
{{Main|Classical Latin}}

Traditionally, the height of Latin literature has been assigned to the period from 81 BC to AD 17, although recent scholarship has questioned the assumptions that privileged the works of this period over both earlier and later works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinds|first1=Stephen|title=Allusion and Intertext|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0521571863|pages=52–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period is usually said to have begun with the first known speech of [[Cicero]] and ended with the death of [[Ovid]].

==== The age of Cicero ====

[[File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus148.png|thumb|Roman Orator.]]

[[Cicero]] has traditionally been considered the master of Latin prose.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, Charles W. [https://books.google.com/books?id=uLGVxD1fX8UC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Letters of Marcus Tullius Cicero and Letters of Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus: Part 9 Harvard Classics.''] Kessinger Publishing, 2004. p. 3. Web. 15 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nettleship, Henry; Haverfield, F. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pPcgIEC3CPIC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Lectures and Essays: Second Series.''] Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 105. Web. 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The writing he produced from about 80 BC until his death in 43 BC exceeds that of any Latin author whose work survives in terms of quantity and variety of genre and subject matter, as well as possessing unsurpassed stylistic excellence. Cicero's many works can be divided into four groups: (1) letters, (2) rhetorical treatises, (3) philosophical works, and (4) orations. His letters provide detailed information about an important period in Roman history and offer a vivid picture of the public and private life among the Roman governing class. Cicero's works on oratory are our most valuable Latin sources for ancient theories on education and rhetoric. His philosophical works were the basis of moral philosophy during the Middle Ages. His speeches inspired many European political leaders and the founders of the United States.

[[File:M-T-Cicero.jpg|thumb|90px|left|Cicero]]

[[Julius Caesar]] and [[Sallust]] were outstanding historical writers of Cicero's time. Caesar wrote commentaries on the Gallic and civil wars in a straightforward style to justify his actions as a general. Sallust adopted an abrupt, pointed style in his historical works. He wrote brilliant descriptions of people and their motives.

The birth of lyric poetry in Latin occurred during the same period. The short love lyrics of [[Catullus]] are noted for their emotional intensity. Catullus also wrote poems that attacked his enemies. In his longer poems, he suggested images in rich, delicate language.

One of the most learned writers of the period was [[Marcus Terentius Varro]]. Called "the most learned of the Romans" by [[Quintillian]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/10A*.html#1.95 Institutio Oratoria by Quintillian]&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote about a remarkable variety of subjects, from religion to poetry. But only his writings on agriculture and the Latin language are extant in their complete form.

==== The Augustan Age ====
{{Main|Augustan literature (ancient Rome)}}
[[File:Virgilio.png|thumb|120px|right|Virgil]]

The emperor [[Augustus]] took a personal interest in the literary works produced during his years of power from 27 BC to AD 14. This period is sometimes called the Augustan Age of Latin Literature. [[Virgil]] published his pastoral ''Eclogues'', the ''Georgics'', and the ''Aeneid'', an epic poem describing the events that led to the creation of Rome. Virgil told how the Trojan hero Aeneas became the ancestor of the Roman people. Virgil also provided divine justification for Roman rule over the world. Although Virgil died before he could put the finishing touches on his poem, it was soon recognized as the greatest work of Latin literature.&lt;ref&gt;Morton Braund, Susanna. [https://books.google.com/books?id=IOwR7uVMGUYC&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Latin literature.''] Routledge, 2002. p. 1. Web. 15 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colish, Marcía L. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WY-2MeZqoK0C&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Stoic Tradition from Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages: Stoicism in classical Latin literature.''] BRILL, 1990. p. 226. Web. 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Virgil's friend [[Horace]] wrote ''Epodes'', ''Odes'', ''Satires'', and ''Epistles''. The perfection of the ''Odes'' in content, form, and style has charmed readers for hundreds of years. The ''Satires'' and ''Epistles'' discuss ethical and literary problems in an urbane, witty manner. Horace's ''Art of Poetry'', probably published as a separate work, greatly influenced later poetic theories. It stated the basic rules of classical writing as the Romans understood and used them. After Virgil died, Horace was Rome's leading poet.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica Educational Publishing. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LHA_SydyKOYC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Poetry and Drama: Literary Terms and Concepts.''] The Rosen Publishing Group, 2011. p. 39. Web. 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin elegy reached its highest development in the works of [[Tibullus]], [[Propertius]], and [[Ovid]]. Most of this poetry is concerned with love. Ovid also wrote the ''Fasti'', which describes Roman festivals and their legendary origins. Ovid's greatest work, the ''Metamorphoses'' weaves various myths into a fast-paced, fascinating story. Ovid was a witty writer who excelled in creating lively and passionate characters. The ''Metamorphoses'' was the best-known source of Greek and Roman mythology throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. It inspired many poets, painters, and composers.

In prose, [[Livy]] produced a history of the Roman people in 142 books. Only 35 survived, but they are a major source of information on Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Cary, Max; Haarhoff, Theodore Johannes. [https://books.google.com/books?id=bx8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA268&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Life and thought in the Greek and Roman world.''] Taylor &amp; Francis, 1985. p. 268. Web. 15 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Imperial Period ===
From the death of Augustus in AD 14 until about 200, Roman authors emphasized style and tried new and startling ways of expression. During the reign of [[Nero]] from 54 to 68, the Stoic philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] wrote a number of dialogues and letters on such moral themes as mercy and generosity. In his ''Natural Questions'', Seneca analyzed earthquakes, floods, and storms. Seneca's tragedies greatly influenced the growth of tragic drama in Europe. His nephew [[Lucan]] wrote the ''Pharsalia'' (about 60), an epic poem describing the civil war between Caesar and [[Pompey]]. The ''Satyricon'' (about 60) by [[Petronius]] was the first Latin novel.&lt;ref&gt;Grube, George Maximilian Antony. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jerucRW8UmMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Greek+and+Roman+Critics&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=rLmZTtvLDsWDOsDKqYkK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q= ''The Greek and Roman critics.''] Hackett Publishing, 1965. p. 261. Web. 15 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Only fragments of the complete work survive. It describes the adventures of various low-class characters in absurd, extravagant, and dangerous situations, often in the world of petty crime.

Epic poems included the ''Argonautica'' of [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]], the ''Thebaid'' of [[Statius]], and the ''Punica'' of [[Silius Italicus]]. At the hands of [[Martial]], the epigram achieved the stinging quality still associated with it. [[Juvenal]] brilliantly satirized vice.

The historian [[Tacitus]] painted an unforgettably dark picture of the early empire in his ''Histories'' and ''Annals'', both written in the early 2nd century. His contemporary [[Suetonius]] wrote biographies of the 12 Roman rulers from [[Julius Caesar]] through [[Domitian]]. The letters of [[Pliny the Younger]] described Roman life of the period. [[Quintilian]] composed the most complete work on ancient education that we possess. Important works from the 2nd century include the ''Attic Nights'' of [[Aulus Gellius]], a collection of anecdotes and reports of literary discussions among his friends; and the letters of the orator [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto]] to [[Marcus Aurelius]]. The most famous work of the period was ''Metamorphoses'', also called ''The Golden Ass'', by [[Apuleius]]. This novel concerns a young man who is accidentally changed into a donkey. The story is filled with colorful tales of love and witchcraft.

=== Latin in the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Early Modernity ===
Pagan Latin literature showed a final burst of vitality in the late 3rd century through 5th centuries. [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] in history, [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]] in oratory, and [[Ausonius]] and [[Rutilius Claudius Namatianus]] in poetry all wrote with great talent. The ''Mosella'' by Ausonius demonstrated a modernism of feeling that indicates the end of classical literature as such.

At the same time, other men laid the foundations of [[Christian Latin literature]] during the 4th century and 5th century. They included the church fathers [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Jerome]], and [[Ambrose]], and the first great Christian poet, [[Prudentius]].

During the Renaissance there was a return to the Latin of Classical times, called for this reason [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]]. This purified language continued to be used as the ''lingua franca'' among the learned throughout Europe, with the great works of [[Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Baruch Spinoza]] all being composed in Latin. Among the last important books written primarily in Latin prose were the works of [[Emanuel Swedenborg|Swedenborg]] (d. 1772), [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] (d. 1778), [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (d. 1783), [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] (d. 1855), and [[Isaac Newton]] (d. 1727), and Latin remains a necessary skill for modern readers of great early modern works of linguistics, literature, and philosophy.

Several of the leading English poets wrote in Latin as well as English.  [[Milton's 1645 Poems]] are one example, but there were also [[Thomas Campion]], [[George Herbert]] and Milton's colleague [[Andrew Marvell]]. Some indeed wrote chiefly in Latin and were valued for the elegance and Classicism of their style. Examples of these were [[Anthony Alsop]] and [[Vincent Bourne]], who were noted for the ingenious way that they adapted their verse to describing details of life in the 18th century while never departing from the purity of Latin diction.&lt;ref&gt;D.K.Money, "The Latin Poetry of English Gentlemen", in ''Neo-Latin Poetry in the British Isles'', London 2012, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=baNhaEOtbzYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.125ff]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the last to be noted for the quality of his Latin verse well into the 19th century was [[Walter Savage Landor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/landor.html Poems online]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics of Latin literature ==
Much Latin writing reflects the Romans' interest in rhetoric, the art of speaking and persuading. Public speaking had great importance for educated Romans because most of them wanted successful political careers. When Rome was a [[Roman Republic|republic]], effective speaking often determined who would be elected or what bills would pass. After Rome became an [[Roman Empire|empire]], the ability to impress and persuade people by the spoken word lost much of its importance. But training in rhetoric continued to flourish and to affect styles of writing. A large part of rhetoric consists of the ability to present a familiar idea in a striking new manner that attracts attention. Latin authors became masters of this art of variety.

=== Language and form ===
Latin is a highly ''inflected'' language, with many grammatical forms for various words. As a result, it can be used with a pithiness and brevity unknown in English. It also lends itself to elaboration, because its tight syntax holds even the longest and most complex sentence together as a logical unit. Latin can be used with striking conciseness, as in the works of [[Sallust]] and [[Tacitus]]. Or it can have wide, sweeping phrases, as in the works of [[Livy]] and the speeches of [[Cicero]].

Latin lacks the rich poetic vocabulary that marks the Greek poetry. Some earlier Latin poets tried to make up for this deficiency by creating new compound words, as the Greeks had done. But Roman writers seldom invented words. Except in epic poetry, they tended to use a familiar vocabulary, giving it poetic value by imaginative combinations of words and by rich sound effects. Rome's leading poets had great technical skill in the choice and arrangement of language. They also had an intimate knowledge of the Greek poets, whose themes appear in almost all Roman literature.

Latin moves with impressive dignity in the writings of [[Ovid]], [[Cicero]], or [[Virgil]]. It reflects the seriousness and sense of responsibility that characterized the ruling class of Rome during the great years of the republic. But the Romans could also relax and allow what [[Horace]] called the "Italian vinegar" in their systems to pour forth in wit and satire.

'''Leslie Charteris''' (born '''Leslie Charles Bowyer-Yin''', 12 May 1907 – 15 April 1993), was a [[List of British Chinese people|British-Chinese]]  author of adventure fiction, as well as a screenwriter.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.saint.org/lcbio.htm "Biography of Leslie Charteris."] ''saint.org''. Retrieved: 4 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He was best known for his many books chronicling the adventures of the charming antihero [[Simon Templar]], alias "The Saint."{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Early life==
Charteris was born in [[Singapore]] to a Chinese father, Dr S. C. Yin (Yin Suat Chwan, 1877–1958),&lt;ref&gt;[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/freepress19580403-1.2.5.aspx "Dr S.C. Yin (Son Created The Saint) Dies at Age 82"."] ''The Singapore Free Press'', 3 April 1958. Retrieved: 10 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Lydia Florence Bowyer, who was English. His father was a [[physician]], who claimed to be able to trace his lineage back to the emperors of the [[Shang Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Charteris became interested in writing at an early age. At one point, he created his own magazine with articles, short stories, poems, editorials, serials, and even a comic strip. He attended [[Rossall School]] in [[Fleetwood]], [[Lancashire]], England.

==Career==
Once his first book, written during his first year at [[King's College, Cambridge]], was accepted, he left the university and embarked on a new career. Charteris was motivated by a desire to be unconventional and to become financially well off by doing what he liked to do. He continued to write English thriller stories, while he worked at various jobs from shipping out on a freighter to working as a barman in a country inn. He prospected for gold, dived for pearls, worked in a tin mine and on a rubber plantation, toured England with a carnival, and drove a bus. In 1926, he legally changed his last name to Charteris, after [[Colonel Francis Charteris]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, although, in the [[BBC Radio 4]] documentary ''Leslie Charteris – A Saintly Centennial'', his daughter stated that he selected his surname from the telephone directory.

===Origin of Simon Templar===
His third novel, ''[[Meet the Tiger]]'' (1928), introduced his most famous creation, Simon Templar.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/obituaries/leslie-charteris-dies-mystery-writer-was-85.html "Leslie Charteris Dies; Mystery Writer Was 85."] ''[[The New York Times]]'' 18 April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his 1980 introduction to a reprint by Charter Books, Charteris indicated he was dissatisfied with the work, suggesting its only value was as the start of the long-running Saint series. Occasionally, he chose to ignore the existence of ''Meet the Tiger'' altogether and claimed that the Saint series actually began with the second volume, ''[[Enter the Saint]]'' (1930); an example of this can be found in the introduction Charteris wrote to an early 1960s edition of ''Enter the Saint'' published by Fiction Publishing Company (an imprint of [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]).

Although he wrote a few other books (including a novelisation of his [[screenplay]] for the [[Deanna Durbin]] mystery-comedy ''[[Lady on a Train]]'', and the English translation of ''Juan Belmonte: Killer of Bulls'' by [[Manuel Chaves Nogales]]), his lifework — at least in the literary world —  consisted primarily of Simon Templar Saint adventures, which were presented in novel, novella, and short-story formats over the next 35 years (with other authors [[ghost writing]] the stories on Charteris' behalf from 1963 onward; Charteris acted as an editor for these books, approving stories and making revisions when needed).

===Move to the United States===
Charteris relocated to the United States in 1932, where he continued to publish short stories and also became a writer for [[Paramount Pictures]], working on the [[George Raft]] film, ''[[Midnight Club (film)|Midnight Club]]''.&lt;ref&gt;DelFattore 1989&lt;/ref&gt; {{page needed|date=September 2016}}

However, Charteris was excluded from permanent residency in the United States because of the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]], a law which prohibited immigration for persons of "50% or greater" Oriental blood. As a result, Charteris was forced to continually renew his six-month temporary visitor's visa. Eventually, an act of Congress personally granted  his daughter and him the right of permanent residence in the United States, with eligibility for naturalisation, which he later completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = United States Congressional Serial Set | publisher = [[U.S. Government Printing Office]] | date = 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other activities===
In America, ''The Saint'' became a radio series starring [[Vincent Price]].  In the 1940s, Charteris, besides continuing to write ''The Saint'' stories, scripted the ''[[Sherlock Holmes]]'' radio series featuring [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[Nigel Bruce]].&lt;ref&gt;Marks 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} In 1941, Charteris appeared in a ''[[Life Magazine|Life]]'' photographic adaptation of a short story of ''The Saint'', with himself playing the Saint.&lt;ref&gt;{Charteris, Leslie.

===The Saint on Film===
Long-term success eluded Charteris' creation outside the literary arena until RKO produced an eight film series between 1938 and 1943: 
The Saint in New York (1938) with Louis Hayward as The Saint;
The Saint Strikes Back (1939), 
The Saint in London (1939), 
The Saint's Double Trouble (1940),
The Saint Takes Over (1940), and 
The Saint in Palm Springs (1941) all with George Sanders as The Saint; Hugh Sinclair took over the role in The Saint's Vacation (1941) and The Saint Meets the Tiger (produced in 1941 but not released until 1943).

A ninth film, The Saint's Return (known as The Saint's Girl Friday in the US) from 1953, with Louis Hayward returning as The Saint, is sometimes regarded as part of the RKO series. However, it was produced by British Hammer Film Productions 12 years after the conflict between Charteris and RKO, based on a special agreement between Hammer Films and Leslie Charteris, which gave Charteris a percentage in the film. RKO acted only as the film's US distributor, six months after the UK release.

===The Saint on TV===
In 1962–1969 the British-produced television series ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'' went into production with [[Roger Moore]] in the Simon Templar role.

Many episodes of the TV series were based upon Charteris' short stories. Later, as original scripts were commissioned, Charteris permitted some of these scripts to be novelised and published as further adventures of the Saint in printed form (these later books, with titles such as ''[[The Saint on TV]]'' and ''[[The Saint and the Fiction Makers]]'', carried Charteris' name as author, but were in fact written by others). Charteris  lived to see a second British TV series, ''[[Return of the Saint]]'' starring [[Ian Ogilvy]] as Simon Templar, enjoy a well-received, if brief, run, and in the 1980s, a series of TV movies produced by an international co-production and starring [[Simon Dutton]] kept interest in ''The Saint'' alive. Also, an ill-fated attempt at a 1980s TV series was made in the United States, which resulted in only a [[television pilot|pilot episode]] being produced and broadcast.  He also produced the original theme tune to the series, as can be seen on the end credits.

==Later life==
The adventures of ''The Saint'' were chronicled in nearly 100 books (about 50 published in the UK and US, with others published in France). Charteris himself stepped away from writing the books after ''[[The Saint in the Sun]]'' (1963). The next year, ''[[Vendetta for the Saint]]'' was published and while it was credited to Charteris, it was actually written by [[science fiction]] writer [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]. Following ''Vendetta'', as noted above, came a number of books adapting televised episodes; these books were credited to Charteris, but were actually by others (although Charteris himself did collaborate on several Saint books in the 1970s). Several ''Return of the Saint'' scripts were also adapted, and some original stories were thrown into the mix. Charteris appears to have served in an editorial capacity for these later volumes. He also edited (and contributed to) ''The Saint Mystery Magazine'', a digest-sized publication. The final book in the Saint series was ''[[Salvage for the Saint]]'', published in 1983. Two additional books were published in 1997, a novelization of the [[The Saint (1997 film)|film loosely based on the character]], and an original novel published by "The Saint Club", a [[fan club]] that Charteris himself founded in the 1930s. Both books were written by [[Burl Barer]], who also wrote the definitive history on Charteris and ''The Saint''.

Charteris spent 55 years - 1928 to 1983 - as either writer of or custodian of Simon Templar's literary adventures, one of the longest uninterrupted spans of a single author in the history of mystery fiction, equalling that of [[Agatha Christie]], who wrote her novels and stories featuring the detective [[Hercule Poirot]] over a similar 55-year period.

==Personal life and death==
Besides being a fiction writer, Charteris also wrote a column on cuisine for an American magazine as a sideline. He also invented a wordless, [[Ideogram|pictorial sign language]] called Paleneo and wrote a book on it. In addition, Charteris was also one of the earliest members of [[Mensa International|Mensa]].&lt;ref name=MensaItaly&gt;[http://www.mensa.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=28 Cos'è il Mensa?] Mensa Italy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ContemporaryAuthors&gt;''Contemporary Authors, New Revision Series'', Volume 58, Page 80&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Charteris married Hollywood actress [[Audrey Long]] (1922-2014); the couple eventually returned to England, where he spent his last years living in [[Surrey]].

Charteris died at Princess Margaret's Hospital [[Windsor, Berkshire]], on 15 April 1993, and was survived by his wife and a daughter, Patricia.

==Family==
He was married four times:
#(in 1931) to Pauline Schishkin (1911–1975), daughter of a Russian diplomat
#(in 1938) to Barbara Meyer (1907–1950), editor at ''[[The American Magazine]]''
#(in 1943) to Elizabeth Bryant Borst (1909–2003), Boston society woman and night club singer
#(in 1952) to [[Audrey Long]] (1922–2014), film actress

Charteris was the brother of Rev [[Roy Henry Bowyer-Yin|Roy Bowyer-Yin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.saint.org/2010/12/roy-henry-bowyer-yin-1910-2010.html|title=Roy Henry Bowyer-Yin (1910-2010)|publisher=blog.saint.org|date= |accessdate= 8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of [[Googie architecture]] structures''' in the United States which includes a photographic gallery with a brief description of some of the structures which still remain. Googie was an original architectural style which began in [[Southern California]] during the late 1940s. Influenced by the coming of the [[Space age]], the Googie-themed architecture popularity was most notable during the mid-1960s, among [[motel]]s, [[coffee house]]s and [[gas station]]s. The term "Googie" comes from a now defunct [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]] and [[Coffeehouse|cafe]] built in [[West Hollywood]]&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Valerie J.|last=Nelson|title=Eldon Davis dies at 94; architect designed 'Googie' coffee shops |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-me-eldon-davis-20110426,0,5591348.story |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=|date=2011-04-26 |accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed by [[John Lautner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archdaily.com/tag/john-lautner/ John Lautner] Why Do Bad Guys Always Get The Best Houses?

This '''list of massacres of Indigenous Australians''' details groups of Aboriginal people that were killed after the [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|British colonisation of Australia]] of 1788. These events were a fundamental element of the [[Australian frontier wars|frontier wars]].&lt;ref name="Mapping"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapping the massacres of Australia's colonial frontier|url=https://www.newcastle.edu.au/newsroom/featured-news/mapping-the-massacres-of-australias-colonial-frontier|website=www.newcastle.edu.au|publisher=University of Newcastle|accessdate=13 September 2017|language=en|date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research efforts are attempting to map the massacres, based on information derived from the reporting of 'Violence on the Australian Colonial Frontier, 1788-1960' undertaken by the [[Australian Research Council]].&lt;ref&gt;https://namesofplaces.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=1fca23b6fd87494e8f98ff2e29c71b4b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/mapping-massacres&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mapping" /&gt; Using defined criteria the University of Newcastle researchers have mapped 250 massacre sites in stage 1 of the project, the period up to 1930,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-27/map-of-indigenous-massacres-grows-to-include-more-sites/10040206 |title=Map of indigenous massacres grows to included more sites of violence across Australia |quote=..Professor Ryan said she thought the number of sites could rise to 500. |author=Bridet Brennan |date=27 July 2018 |website=abc.net.au |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; now rendered as an interactive online resource&lt;ref&gt;https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/map.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jul/05/map-of-massacres-of-indigenous-people-reveal-untold-history-of-australia-painted-in-blood&lt;/ref&gt;

The following list tallies a few of the better documented massacres of Aboriginal Australians, which took place mainly during the colonial period. 
{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}

==Some frontier massacres on record==
===New South Wales===
==== 1788 ====
* Two unarmed rushcutters murdered by aboriginals being the first murders committed since first fleet arrival.
* Major outbreak of smallpox kills large numbers of indigenous Australians between Hawkesbury River, Broken Bay, and Port Hacking.  Dr Seth Carus&lt;ref&gt;Distinguished Research Fellow, Center for the Study of WMD, National Defense University, Ft. McNair, Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; (2015) states: "Ultimately, we have a strong circumstantial case supporting the theory that someone deliberately introduced smallpox in the Aboriginal population."&lt;ref name="Carus2015"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The History of Biological Weapons Use: What We Know and What We Don't. |journal=Health Security |date=2015 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=219–55 |doi=10.1089/hs.2014.0092 |pmid=26221997 |last1=Carus |first1=W. S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1790s ====
* '''July 1791''' Governor [[Arthur Phillip]] wrote in his own journal that he granted 27 ex-convicts allotments of land at [[Prospect Hill (New South Wales)|Prospect Hill]] and [[The Ponds, New South Wales|The Ponds]]. He gave them muskets which were utilised to shoot at Aboriginals in the area. In retaliation, some of the British huts were burnt down. Arthur Philip then deployed soldiers to the area who "dispersed" about 50 Aboriginals. Furthermore, as the allotments of land were separated by bushland which helped in "concealing the natives", the Governor ordered the woods to be cleared so that the "natives could find no shelter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=John|title=An Historical Journal of the Transactions at Port Jackson and Norfolk Island including the Journals of Governors Phillip and King|date=1793|publisher=John Stockdale|location=Piccadilly|page=474|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=t0tfAAAAcAAJ|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''April 1794''' At [[Toongabbie]] an armed party of settlers pursued a group of Aboriginals who were taking corn from the settlers' farms. They killed four, bringing back the severed head of one as proof of their exploits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=David|title=An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales|date=1804|publisher=Cadell and Davies|location=The Strand|page=260|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Yx0QAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''September 1794'''  British settlers in the [[Hawkesbury River]] area killed seven [[Bidjigal|Bediagal]] people in reprisal for the theft of clothing and provisions.&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Lyndall|title=Untangling Aboriginal resistance and the settler punitive expedition: the Hawkesbury River frontier in New South Wales, 1794–1810|journal=Journal of Genocide Research|date=1 June 2013|volume=15|issue=2|pages=219–232|doi=10.1080/14623528.2013.789206|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14623528.2013.789206|accessdate=25 October 2017|issn=1462-3528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the surviving children of this raid were taken by the settlers and detained as farm labourers. One boy, who was considered a spy, was later dragged through a fire, thrown into the river and shot dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=David|title=An Account of the English Colony in NSW|date=1804|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A skirmish (known as the [[Battle of Parramatta]]) then occurred between Pemulwuy's group and a collection of British soldiers and settlers.  One of the settlers was injured but at least five Aboriginals were shot dead with many more wounded, including Pemulwuy.

* '''1838'''. [[Myall Creek massacre]] – 10 June: 28 people killed at Myall Creek near [[Inverell, New South Wales]]. This was the first Aboriginal massacre for which white European and black African settlers were successfully prosecuted. Several colonists had previously been found not guilty by juries despite the weight of evidence and one colonist found guilty had been pardoned when his case was referred to Britain for sentencing. Eleven men were charged with murder but were initially acquitted by a jury. On the orders of the Governor, a new trial was held using the same evidence and seven of the eleven men were found guilty of the murder of one Aboriginal child and hanged. In his book, ''Blood on the Wattle'', journalist [[Bruce Elder (journalist)|Bruce Elder]] says that the successful prosecutions resulted in pacts of silence becoming a common practice to avoid sufficient evidence becoming available for future prosecutions.&lt;ref name="Elder"&gt;{{cite book | last = [[Bruce Elder (journalist)|Bruce Elder]] | first = | year = 1998 | title = Blood on the Wattle: Massacres and maltreatment of Aboriginal Australians since 1788  | publisher = [[New Holland Publishers]] | location = Pg 94 | isbn = 1-86436-410-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another effect, as one contemporary Sydney newspaper reported, was that poisoning Aboriginal people became more common as "a safer practice".

According to Judith Bassett,&lt;ref&gt;Judith Bassett, 'The Faithful Massacre at the Broken River, 1838' in ''Journal of Australian Studies'', No.24, May 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; some 20 [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] attacked (according to one recent account, possibly as a reprisal for the killing of several Aboriginal people at [[Ovens, Victoria|Ovens]] earlier by the same stockmen) and at least one [[Koori]] and eight [[European ethnic groups|European]]s died.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Clark, ''The Encyclopaedia of Australia's Battles ''Allen &amp; Unwin, 2010 p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; This was long known locally as the [[Faithfull Massacre]] though Chris Clark argues that 'there is no reason to view this incident as anything other than a battle which the Aborigines won'.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Clark, ''The Encyclopaedia of Australia's Battles ''  p.14&lt;/ref&gt;   It also seems they were [[camping]] on a ground reserved for hunting or ceremonies.  Reprisals occurred at Wangaratta on the Ovens River, at Murchison (led by the native police under Dana and in the company of the young [[Edward Curr]], who could not bring himself to discuss what he witnessed there other than to say he took issue with the official reports). Other incidents were recorded by Mitchelton and Toolamba. This "hunting ground" would have been a ceremonial ground probably called a 'Kangaroo ground'. Hunting grounds were all over so not something that would instigate an attack. The colonial government decided to "open up" the lands south of Yass after the Faithful Massacre and bring them under British rule. This was as much to try and protect the Aboriginal people from reprisals as to open up new lands for the colonists.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In May 1839, Daung Wurrung killed two shepherds in reprisal for the murder of three Daung the previous month.  An armed party of settlers led by station owner Charles Hutton killed up to 40 Daung at a campsite near Campaspe Creek. The following month, Hutton led an armed party of police who killed six Dja Dja Wurrung at another camp. All six had been shot in the back while fleeing. The Assistant Protector of Aborigines for the region, described the massacre as "a deliberately planned illegal reprisal."&lt;ref&gt;Bain Attwood, pp7-9 My Country.

The ''Tarnbeere Gundidj'' clan of the [[Djargurd Wurrung]] people, around 35-40 people, was wiped out. Public censure led to Taylor's River being renamed Mount Emu Creek and, fearing prosecution for the massacre, in late 1839 or early 1840 Taylor fled to India. Of particular note for this massacre is the extent of oral history, first hand accounts of the incident, the detail in settler diaries, records of Weslayan missionaries, and Aboriginal Protectorate records.&lt;ref&gt;Ian D.

* '''1830'''. [[Fremantle]] The first official "punishment raid" on Aboriginal people in Western Australia, led by Captain Irwin took place in May 1830. A detachment of soldiers led by Irwin attacked an Aboriginal encampment north of Fremantle in the belief that it contained men who had "broken into and plundered the house of a man called Paton" and killed some poultry. Paton had called together a number of settlers who, armed with muskets, set after the Aboriginal people and came upon them not far from the home. "The tall savage who appeared the Chief showed unequivocal gestures of defiance and contempt" and was accordingly shot. Irwin stated, "This daring and hostile conduct of the natives induced me to seize the opportunity to make them sensible to our superiority, by showing how severely we could retaliate their aggression."  In actions that followed over the next few days, more Aboriginal people were killed and wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facp.iinet.net.au/teachingnotes/myplaceback.html|title=Study guide to "My Place" by Sally Morgan|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Stannage, (1979), The People of Perth: a social history of Western Australia's Capital City, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''c. 1872'''. Over 200 killed by Native Police at Skull Hole on the head of Mistake Creek, [[Bladensburg National Park|Bladensburg Station]] (near Winton) Central Queensland. In 1888, the visiting Norwegian scientist [[Carl Sofus Lumholtz|Carl Lumholtz]] recalled how he in about 1882-84 "was shown" at Bladensburg "a large number of skulls of natives who had been shot by the black police" some years earlier. in 1901 P. H. F Mackay wrote an article to ''[[The Queenslander]]'' citing one witness and participant in this dispersal – the later property manager Hazelton Brock – who classified the incident as "the Massacre of the Blacks" and stated that it took place at the Skull Hole on Mistake Creek. Thus two unrelated sources give evidence and details (notably with reports of forensic evidence in both cases) of at least one large-scale dispersals at Bladensburg some time about 1877–1879. It was "one of the most blood curdling sights I ever saw" Hazelton Brock is supposed to have stated. Both sources describe it as connected to an Aboriginal attack on a bullock wagon during which one man was 'murdered'. The dispersal was headed by Acting Sub-inspector Robert Wilfred Moran (1846–1911) and his troopers and a group of settlers headed by George Fraser – 14 men in all  – and the target was a large camp with hundreds of blacks in the "Skull Hole" in "the Forsyth Ranges on the head of Mistake Creek." Hazelton Brock is cited for the statement that over 200 blacks were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Lumholtz: Among Cannibals: an account of four years travels in Australia, and of camp life with the aborigines of Queensland (London 1889) page 58-9: ''Queenslander'' 20 Apr 1901, page 757-758: "The Massacre of the Blacks at the Skull Hole on Mistake Creek".

* '''1873'''. The Battle Camp collision, Far North Queensland in about December 1873 supposedly took the life of a number of Aborigines. The event took place during the first rush of miners travelling from the Endeavour River to the Palmer river in about November or December 1873. In an article in the ''Queenslander''{{'}}s Sketcher in December 1875, one digger recalled the Palmer rush two years earlier. One morning he and his party had, he told: ...passed 'Battle camp' ... It was here the blacks of the interior first re-ceived their 'baptism of fire;' where they first became acquainted with the death-dealing properties of the mysterious weapon of the white man;...Here and there a skull, bleached to the whiteness of snow, with a round bullet-hole to show the cause of its present location...&lt;ref&gt;Ørsted-Jensen, Robert: ''Frontier History Revisited'' (Brisbane 2011), page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1874-75'''. Blackfellow's Creek, [[Far North Queensland]]. A letter from a miner dated "Upper Palmer River April 16, 1876", describes his camp at a place known locally as "Blackfellows creek". He explained, leaving very little doubt as to its appearance, that: "...To my enquiry as to why it was so named, the answer is that not long since 'the niggers got a dressing there' – whatever that may mean; possibly a bright coloured shirt apiece, for decency's sake. There have been, certainly, 'dressings' of another sort dealt out in this part of the country to the blacks,.... Be that as it may, however, the Golgotha on which we are at present camped would well repay a visit from any number of phrenological students in search of a skull, or of anatomical professors in want of a 'subject.'"&lt;ref&gt;Ørsted-Jensen, Robert: Frontier History Revisited (Brisbane 2011), page 72.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1878'''. "Dispersing the mob". A total of 75 dead or dying was counted after just one Native Police "dispersal", most likely somewhere in the Cook district in Far North Queensland. In the January 1879 issue of Brisbane ''Daily News'', the highly acclaimed editor [[Carl Feilberg]], recorded the numbers of killed during a dispersal in the far north (most likely Cook district) saying "A gentleman, on whose words reliance can be placed, has stated that after one of these raids he has counted as many as seventy-five natives dead or dying upon the ground. Of course the official returns will report the aboriginal race to be fast dying out."&lt;ref&gt;Daily News (Brisbane) 1 Jan 1879, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1879''' Selwyn Range, North-West Queensland. It has been estimated that a total of 300 Aborigines (supposedly of the Kalkadoon tribe) were shot in a series of Native Police and settler "dispersals" ending in the Selwyn Ranges. It was retaliation supposedly on the Kalkadoon tribe following the alleged "murder" of the squatter Bernard Molvo and his men James Kelly, "Harry" or Henry Butler and "Tommy" or Thomas Holmes who was killed while in the process of forming a station at Suleiman Creek (this event was called the 'Woonamo massacre' as the bodies of the victims was found in the 'Wonomo billabong' at Sulieman Creek). Luke Russell, the manager of Stanbook station, Alexander Kennedy and later Sub-inspector Ernest Eglington and his troopers were all involved in a series of retaliations culminating in the Selwyn Range. Robert Clarke estimated in 1901 that a total of 300 was shot.&lt;ref&gt;Queenslander 8 Mar 1879, page 294; T. Bottoms ''Conspiracy of Silence'' page 162-163&lt;/ref&gt;

There were twenty-eight men and thirteen [[List of ethnic slurs#G|gins]] thus enclosed, of whom none of the former escaped.

* '''1874'''. [[Barrow Creek]] Massacre. In February Mounted Constable Samuel Gason arrived at Barrow Creek and a telegraph station was established. Eight days later a group of [[Kaytetye people|Kaytetye]] men attacked the station, killing two whites, Stapleton and Franks, while some others were injured. The motivation for the assault is unclear, various reasons suggest either failure to provide sufficient goods in exchange for the occupation of territory, retaliation for treatment of Kaytetye women, the closing off of their only water source, or, according to a later memory, revenge for setting up the station on one of the most sacred Kaytetye sites. According to [[Ted Strehlow|T. G. H. Strehlow]]'s information, obtained from elders, the tribe couldn't take out revenge on white criminals who had abducted and raped their women, and so decided to punish the only whites in their vicinity.{{sfn|Kimber|1991|pp=5-6}}

:Strehlow also added later that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The] Kaititja in 1874 did only what Europeans living in occupied countries were to do during the 1939-45 war to enemy officials ... guerilla fighters and patriotic individuals made their attacks upon the intruders wherever and whenever opportunities arose.{{sfn|Kimber|1991|pp=5-6}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:Samuel Gason mounted a large police hunt against the Kaytetye, with patrols out scouring the land for 6 weeks.  'Skipper' Partridge recalled in 1918 that the patrols shot every black they laid eyes on. The official report stated 10 Kaytetye had been killed by the punitive expedition. Other estimates go up to 40 or more.{{sfn|Kimber|1991|p=7}} [[Skull Creek (Northern Territory)|Skull Creek]], where the massacre took place, 50 miles south of Barrow Creek, takes its name from the bleached bones found there long after, the remains of a camp of aborigines shot by one of the patrols, though, according to an old settler, Alex Ross, "They were just blacks sitting in their camp, and the party was looking around for blacks to shoot."{{sfn|Hill|2002|p=155}}

As one of the early missionaries, R.D.Joynt, wrote (1918:7), hundred had been "shot down like game." And possibility, however, that they might have succeeded in preserving their cultural integrity ended drastically around the start of the 20th century when a huge London-based cattle consortium The Eastern and African Cold Storage Company acquired massive tracts of land to carve out a pastoral empire from the Roper River north into Arnhem Land. Purchasing all stocked and viable stations along the western Roper River, they began moving cattle eastward. Determined to put down all Aboriginal resistance, they employed gangs of up to 14 men to hunt down all inhabitants of the region and shoot them on sight. With police and other authorities maintaining a "conspiracy of silence", they staged a systematic campaign of extermination against the Roper River peoples (Harris 1994:695-700). They almost succeeded.' Gerhard Leitner, Ian G. Malcolm, ''The habitat of Australia's aboriginal languages: past, present and future'', Walter de Gruyter, 2007 pp.143-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The accounts became widely known after oral histories collected for the 1989 East Kimberley Impact Assessment Project (EKIAP) were published in 1999. As is customary for Indigenous reports, the EKIAP did not name anyone who was dead. Moran was unaware that several of the original written accounts did name not only the eyewitnesses and survivors but also the killers and other whites who were present but did not participate.&lt;ref name="Clement"/&gt;
* '''June 1926'''. [[Forrest River massacre]]: Western Australian police constables, James Graham St Jack and Dennis Hastings Regan led a month long punitive expedition against Aboriginals living in the [[Forrest River]] region. After the local mission station reported around 30 people missing, a police investigation was organised. This investigation found that at least 16 aboriginals were killed and their remains burnt in three purpose-built stone ovens. The police investigation led to a Royal Commission the following year. During the proceedings of this Commission, the suggestion of the evidence of a native being equal to that of a white man was openly mocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38008987 |title=Mr. Gribble Cross-Examined. |newspaper=Western Mail |volume=XLII |issue=2,145 |location=Western Australia |date=10 March 1927 |accessdate=13 January 2018 |page=16 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this overt attempt to protect the perpetrators, the Commissioner still found that somewhere between 11 and 20 people were killed and St Jack and Regan were subsequently arrested for murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21838926 |title=MURDER OF NATIVES. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |issue=21,636 |date=1 June 1927 |accessdate=13 January 2018 |page=17 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of going to trial, the men were brought before police magistrate Mr. Kidson who, in spite of the findings of the two previous investigations, deemed that the evidence was insufficient to go before a jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article154036638 |title=RELEASE ORDERED |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |volume=XLVII |issue=188 |location=Tasmania|date=11 August 1927 |accessdate=13 January 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regan and St Jack were released and the Premier, [[Philip Collier]], even re-instated them to their previous positions in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article233314709 |title=Constables Regan and St. Jack |newspaper=The Yalgoo Observer And Murchison Chronicle |volume= |location=Western Australia |date=22 March 1928 |accessdate=13 January 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1918''' Bentinck Island: Part of the [[Wellesley Islands]] group, which includes [[Mornington Island]], Bentinck Island was home to the Kaiadilt clan of just over 100 people. In 1911, a man by the name of McKenzie (other names unknown) was given a government lease for nearby [[Sweers Island]] that also covered the eastern portion of the much larger Bentinck Island. Arriving on Bentinck with an Aboriginal woman plus a flock of sheep, he built a hut near the Kurumbali estuary. Although the Kaiadilt avoided contact and refrained from approaching McKenzie's property he is alleged to have often explored the island, shooting any males he found while raping the women. In 1918, McKenzie organised a hunt with an unknown number of settlers from the mainland and, beginning from the northern tip of the island, herded the Indigenous inhabitants to the beach on its southern shore. The majority of the Kaiadilt fled into the sea where those that were not shot from the shore drowned. Those that tried to escape along the beach were hunted down and shot, with the exception of a small number who reached nearby mangroves where the settlers' horses could not follow. Several young women were raped on the beach, then held prisoner in McKenzie's hut for three days before being released. As the Kaiadilt remained isolated throughout much of the 20th century, the massacre remained unknown to the authorities until researchers recorded accounts given by survivors in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Elder2"&gt;{{cite book | last = [[Bruce Elder (journalist)|Bruce Elder]] | first = | year = 1998 | title = Blood on the Wattle: Massacres and maltreatment of Aboriginal Australians since 1788 | publisher = New Holland Publishers | location = Page 203–206 | isbn = 1-86436-410-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1928''' [[Coniston massacre]]: On 7 August 1928, a white dingo trapper, Frederick Brooks, was allegedly murdered by Aboriginal people on [[Coniston, Northern Territory|Coniston]] station in Northern Territory. Brooks had been killed with traditional Aboriginal weapons after which the body was buried. Padygar and Arkikra, two Aboriginal men, were arrested for the murder. They stood trial in Darwin but were ultimately acquitted. The actual killer of Brooks it was later revealed from accounts by Aboriginal eyewitnesses, was Kamalyarrpa Japanangka (aka 'Bullfrog'). The sixty-year-old Brooks was camped at Yurrkuru waterhole, 20&amp;nbsp;km west of the Coniston homestead, when he was attacked early one morning by a group of [[Warlpiri people]], which included Kamalyarrpa. The murder had been planned by Kamalyarrpa 'Bullfrog'. A series of attempted arrests followed stretching over the period from 14 August to 18 October 1928 and instigated by eight people, including groups of civilians (including 3 full blood aboriginals and a "half-caste") and headed by Constable George Murray.&lt;ref name="recordsearch.naa.gov.au"&gt;https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=66518&lt;/ref&gt; Official records say that 17 Aborigines were killed when they attacked the police with boomerangs and spears while the constable attempted to arrest and interview them.&lt;ref name="recordsearch.naa.gov.au"/&gt; A survivor of the massacre, [[Billy Stockman Tjapaltjarri]], later became part of the first generation of [[Papunya]] painting men. Billy Stockman was saved by his mother who put him in a [[coolamon (vessel)|coolamon]].&lt;ref&gt;Jo-Anne Birnie Danzker ''Dreamings--Tjukurrpa: aboriginal art of the Western Desert, the Donald Kahn Collection'', Prestel, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; A court of inquiry said the European action was 'justified'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hreoc.gov.au/bth/text_versions/timeline/ |title=Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission 'Bringing Them Home' website |access-date=17 October 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023181027/http://www.hreoc.gov.au/bth/text_versions/timeline/#1928 |archive-date=23 October 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/frontier/education/coniston.htm Frontier Education history website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210000151/http://www.abc.net.au/frontier/education/coniston.htm |date=10 February 2006 }}, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]  [http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/first_australians/resistance/coniston_massacre Coniston Massacre], [[National Museum of Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marguerite (Maggy) Barankitse''' is an internationally acclaimed humanitarian activist from [[Burundi]] devoted to improving the welfare of children and challenging ethnic discrimination. 
After rescuing 25 children from a massacre she was forced to witness during the [https://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/burundi_womans_mission.html tragic conflicts between Hutu and Tutsi] in Burundi in 1993, Marguerite Barankitse decided to set up Maison Shalom, which would become a shelter to aid children in need, providing access to healthcare, education, and culture to over 20,000 orphan children.&lt;ref&gt;The Huffingtonpost,“Burundi’s Great Mother: Maggie Barankitse”, October 2013 https://www.huffingtonpost.com/katherine-marshall/burundis-great-mother-mag_b_3813440.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the 22 years it operated in Burundi, Maison Shalom grew into a large complex of schools, hospitals, and a network of healthcare services across Burundi. The purpose of Maison Shalom was to improve the lives of Burundi’s children through integrated and sustainable development, with the ultimate aim of fostering a lasting peace in Burundi.
However, in 2015 “Maggy” was forced to flee her country and Maison Shalom, after Burundi plunged into a political crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Council on Foreign Relations, Burundi Political Crisis, https://www.cfr.org/interactives/global-conflict-tracker#!/conflict/political-crisis-in-burundi&lt;/ref&gt;  Far from surrendering, “Maggy” decided to dedicate all her energy to help more than 90.000 Burundian refugees in Rwanda.&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph, "Why the 'Angel of Burundi' fears her country is sliding back into genocide", November 2016 https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/angel-burundi-fears-country-sliding-back-genocide/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, she opened the [http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/read/219159 Community Center Oasis of Peace] in Kigali order to school children, offer psychosocial support to victims of torture and rape, and to implement activities of sustainable development in areas such as health, education, vocational training, culture and income-generation.&lt;ref&gt;The New Times Rwanda, “Oasis of Peace: Giving Burundian refugees new lease of life” http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/read/219159&lt;/ref&gt; As she often says herself, Maggy's vision is to instill dignity in the refugees and to allow them to keep their dreams alive: “Evil never has the last word – love always wins”.

Maggy is the recipient of numerous awards, including the [https://auroraprize.com/en/aurora/detail/9663/laureate-1-million-aurora-prize Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity] (2016),  the [http://www.opusprize.org/maggy-barankitse/ Opus Prize] (2008), the [http://www.fondationchirac.eu/en/2011/11/video-marguerite-barankitse-2011-laureate-of-the-fondation-chirac-prize Prize for Conflict Prevention] (2011), UNESCO (2008), the [http://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2005/4/42722daa4/angel-burundi-receive-nansen-refugee-award.html Nansen Refugee Award] (2005), the [http://rooseveltinstitute.org/fdr-four-freedoms-awards-1/ Four Freedoms Award from the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute] (2004), [https://www.womensrefugeecommission.org/resources/document/download/329 the Voices of Courage Award of the Women’s Commission for Women and Refugee Children] (2004), the World Children’s prize (2003),&lt;ref&gt;World Childrens Prize, Maggy Barankitse Laureate, http://worldschildrensprize.org/maggy-barankitse&lt;/ref&gt; the Juan Maria Bandres Prize for Asylum Rights (1998), and the French Government’s Human Rights Prize (1998).

==Biography==
Marguerite - “Maggy” - Barankitse was born in 1957 in Ruyigi, East-Burundi, one of the poorest regions of the country. She was a teacher at a local secondary school, but was fired because of her protests against discrimination between Hutus and Tutsis in the field of education. She then went to work as a secretary for the Catholic Bishop in Ruyigi.&lt;ref&gt;Nekita Ink, "Extraordinary Women: Celebrating Marguerite Barankitse ‘Angel of Burundi’", June 2017, https://nekitaink.wordpress.com/2017/06/04/extraordinary-women-celebrating-marguerite-barankitse-angel-of-burundi/&lt;/ref&gt; Despite mounting tensions, Maggy put her dream of ethnic harmony into practice by adopting seven children: four Hutus and three Tutsis. As violence escalated between Hutus and Tutsis following the assassination of the first democratically elected president of Burundi, a group of armed Tutsis descended on Ruyigi on October 23rd 1993 to kill the Hutu families who were hiding in the Bishop’s manor. Maggy managed to hide many of the children, but was caught by the fighters. They beat and humiliated her and forced her to watch the killing of 72 Hutus, but she refused to tell them where the children were hidden.&lt;ref&gt;University of Notre Dame, "The Courage of Giving Refuge: Marguerite Barankitse", http://contendingmodernities.nd.edu/events/barankitse/&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, she was spared only because she is a Tutsi. After this ordeal, Maggy gathered her adopted children and the surviving orphans and hid them in a nearby school. As more and more children sought shelter with her, she decided to create a small non-governmental organisation: Maison Shalom, the House of Peace. Maggy’s house was open to children of all ethnic origins: Tutsi, Hutu and Twa. She calls them “my Hutsitwa children”,&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, Woman’s mission for Burundi children was sparked by genocide, May 2004, https://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/burundi_womans_mission.html&lt;/ref&gt; and they call her "Oma"&lt;ref&gt;Le Temps, "La femme qui défie la haine au Burundi", November 2005, https://www.letemps.ch/monde/femme-defie-haine-burundi&lt;/ref&gt; (or grandmother in German). In the following years, Maison Shalom in Ruyigi was one of the few places in Burundi where Hutus and Tutsis cohabited in harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Psychologies, "Marguerite Barankitse, l’harmonie entre les peuples", December 2010, http://www.psychologies.com/Planete/Portraits-de-femmes/Portraits/Marguerite-Barankitse-l-harmonie-entre-les-peuples/10Devenir-inutile&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the terrible events of 1993, over 20,000 children and youth have benefited from Maison Shalom. Before the current crisis in Burundi, the organisation employed more than 270 people, including nurses, psychologists, and educators who implemented special projects for the children. 

In April 2015, Maggy spoke out against the third term of Pierre Nkurunziza and joined the youth demonstrations denouncing the president. As a result, she was obliged to hide for a month in an embassy in Bujumbura.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, "'Why does no one mention Burundi?' asks winner of new humanitarian award", June 2016, https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/11/marguerite-barankitse-why-does-no-one-mention-burundi-winner-humanitarian-award&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, she had to flee, for the government had her name on a list of persons to be eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;RFI Afrique, "George Clooney remet le prix Aurora à la Burundaise Marguerite Barankitse", April 2016, http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20160425-armenie-humanitaire-burundi-barankitse-marguerite-prix-aurora-erevan-clooney&lt;/ref&gt; Having joined the youth demonstrations denouncing the president who sought a third term, Maggy found herself a refugee. 

But her refugee status did not stop Maggy’s devotion to alleviate suffering.&lt;ref&gt;RT France, "LA GRANDE INTERVIEW : MARGUERITE BARANKITSÉ", May 2018,  https://francais.rt.com/magazines/la-grande-interview/50775-marguerite-barankitse&lt;/ref&gt; She has now opened a branch of Maison Shalom in Rwanda.

==Maison Shalom in Burundi==
In the autumn of 1993, after the assassination of [[Melchior Ndadaye]], first democratically elected president of Burundi (Hutu), the [[Burundian_Civil_War|Burundian civil war]] began with massacres taking place throughout the country. In the province of Ruyigi, disaster struck on 24 October. To exact vengeance for the killing of members of their ethnic group, the Tutsi hunted the town’s Hutus, who were hiding in the diocese buildings. Maggy (Tutsi) was also there and she tried to reason with the group of Tutsi to convince them not to use violence. However, her efforts were in vain and they decided to tie her to a chair and forced her to watch the killing of 72 of her friends in front of her.&lt;ref&gt;La Vanguardia, Ima Sanchís, Marguerite Barankitse, La ’Loca de Burundi’, Mars 2009, http://www.adcspinola.org/index.php/descargas-adcspinola/cuaresma-s-jose-anunciacion-semana-santa/semana-santa/pascuas-juveniles/corteconcepcion/ano-2009/845-6domingo3-entrevista-a-la-loca-de-burundi/file&lt;/ref&gt; 
A few hours after the massacre, the children of the victims started to come out of their hiding places. That day, Maggy says, she realized that her mission would be to fight the violence ravaging her country by giving those children, and the 20,000 who would follow, an alternative to hate.&lt;ref&gt;La Vanguardia, “Fundadora de Maison Shalom pide a Europa que deje de pagar guerras en África”, February 2018. https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20180220/44938890469/fundadora-de-maison-shalom-pide-a-europa-que-deje-de-pagar-guerras-en-africa.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Amid the prevailing disaster, the news had spread rapidly about the “crazy woman of Ruyigi” who dared to take in all the orphans who came to her, never refusing anyone. Twa, Hutu, Tutsi: Maggy made no distinction. 

Maggy initially gathered the 25 orphaned of the Ruyigi massacre. With the help of European and Burundian friends, she organized a network that provided care for a growing number of children.&lt;ref&gt;Christel Martin, La Haine n'aura pas le dernier mot : Maggy, la femme aux 10 000 enfants, Paris, Albin Michel, octobre 2005, 47-48-90-102 p. ({{ISBN|2-226158588}})&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1994, the Roman Catholic Bishop of [[Ruyigi]], Bishop Joseph Nduhirubusa&lt;ref&gt;{{catholic-hierarchy|bishop|bndu|Bishop Joseph Nduhirubusa}}&lt;/ref&gt; agreed to transform a former school into a children's shelter called 'Maison Shalom'. The shelter was named so named by the children, in memory of a song heard on the radio at the time, and because the word "peace", in Kirundi had himself been instrumentalized and defiled by the slaughterers on both sides of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Pères Blancs, Voix d'Afrique N°83, “Maggy et la Maison Shalom”, http://peresblancs.org/maison_shalom.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Maison Shalom’s focus was also predominantly children, including child soldiers, orphans, mutilated children and minors in prison. However, the services of Maison Shalom were available to the entire community, changed having an impact not only on the lives of orphans, but also the entire region that could access to these services. While services were available to the entire community, the focus was on children, some of whom were child soldiers, orphans, mutilated child and minors in prison. Maison Shalom’s activities soon also expanded to other cities such as Butezi and Gizuru, where Maggy opened other children's shelters were opened.

Over the years, what was just a shelter seeking to protect orphans from both sides of the Burundian ethnic divide after the civil war, grew into an entire village,&lt;ref&gt;Africa.com, “Maggy Barankitse Built A Village And Saved Thousands of War Orphaned Children in Burundi”, https://www.africa.com/maggy-barankitse-built-a-village/&lt;/ref&gt; (including a bank, a crèche, an hotel,&lt;ref&gt;Afrotribune, “Qui est Marguerite Barankitse, la mère de 20.000 Burundais?” Mars 2018, https://afrotribune.com/marguerite-barankitse-mere-de-20-000-burundais/&lt;/ref&gt; a shop, resource centre for learning sewing and computing, a mechanic training, a swimming pool, the REMA Hospital,&lt;ref&gt;Iwacu Burundi, "20 ans de la Maison Shalom : “Aujourd’hui, nous célébrons la victoire de l’amour sur la haine!”, November 2013, http://www.iwacu-burundi.org/ruyigi-maison-shalom-victoire-amour-sur-haine/&lt;/ref&gt; and even a cinema).&lt;ref&gt;ActionAid, “Maison Shalom - House of Peace”, October 2011. http://www.actionaid.org/2011/10/maison-shalom-house-peace&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:REMA Hospital built by Maison Shalom in Burundi.jpg|thumb|REMA Hospital built by Maison Shalom in Burundi]]

Many of those activities were income-generating initiatives run by the youth themselves, such as the guesthouse, the cinema, the car workshop, etc. When they became independent, the young people supported by Maison Shalom received a small house and a plot of land. 

In 2004 an estimated 20,000 children had benefited from her help, either directly or indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maison-des-anges.org/maisonshalom/historique/historique2004.html |title=Maison des Anges le site de l'association en France pour la Maison Shalom au Burundi |accessdate=2006-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101128/http://www.maison-des-anges.org/maisonshalom/historique/historique2004.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Huffingtonpost,“Burundi’s Great Mother: Maggie Barankitse”, October 2013 https://www.huffingtonpost.com/katherine-marshall/burundis-great-mother-mag_b_3813440.html&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2015, over 300 houses for children and youth aged between 4 and 20 had been built. The NGO also helped internally displaced persons and returning Burundian refugees to reintegrate in Ruyigi and to trace their missing relatives. Maggy Barankitse was on the frontline in the battle against HIV/AIDS, setting up counselling projects to promote HIV/AIDS prevention. She and her staff cared for over 100 HIV infected children who had been abandoned or orphaned. 
Maggy also started an initiative to help the youth who were in prison. Some children were born in prison and she worked to find them a better life, through education and a home outside the prison. Her team continued to promote agriculture and established a microfinance project to enable the mothers and fathers to develop small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;« Les maisons d’orphelins de Maggy » http://www.lalibre.be/actu/international/les-maisons-d-orphelins-de-maggy-51b8dd87e4b0de6db9c3d958, 26 octobre 2011 (consulté le 1er Aout 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

But in 2015, [[Burundian_unrest_(2015–present)|everything fell apart]]. The Burundian government started suppressing protests against a third term for President Nkurunziza. Thousands of Burundians started fleeing to Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania or the DRC. Maggy protests, cares for the wounded young, and feeds those who are in prison. But in June 2015, Marguerite Barankitse is herself forced to flee. In Burundi, her head is priced.&lt;ref&gt;RFI, “Marguerite Barankitse, la « Maman nationale » du Burundi”, September 2014 http://www.rfi.fr/hebdo/20140912-burundi-portrait-marguerite-barankitse-maman-nationale-societe-civile&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maison Shalom Rwanda and the Community Center Oasis of Peace==
Far from surrendering, Maggy refused to spend comfortably her days in Europe and instead decided to dedicate all her energy to help more than 90.000 Burundian refugees in Rwanda.&lt;ref&gt;UNHCR Burundi Situation, May 2018, https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/burundi&lt;/ref&gt;

Maggy started with her expertise; education. She fought to get an education for children and university students who are in refugee camps.&lt;ref&gt;La Vanguardia, "Marguerite Barankitse: “Cuando perdonas, curas el mundo”", February 2017, https://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20180223/44984326969/marguerite-barankitse-burundi-maison-shalom.html&lt;/ref&gt; She has put 126 children in preschool, 160 in secondary school and obtained 353 scholarships for University refugee students to join Rwandan universities, and 10 scholarships for the best students to study in universities abroad.

In May 2017, Maggy opened the Community Center Oasis of Peace in order to school children, offer psychosocial support to victims of torture and rape, and to implement activities of sustainable development in areas such as health, education, vocational training, culture, and income-generation.&lt;ref&gt;RPA, “La Maison Shalom s’étend avec un centre communautaire inauguré à Kigali”, May 2017, http://www.rpa.bi/index.php/2011-08-15-07-10-58/societe/item/3509-la-maison-shalom-s-etend-avec-un-centre-communautaire-inaugure-a-kigali&lt;/ref&gt;
The Centre already offers a variety of courses including English language, culinary arts, tailoring, embroidery and painting. It also has a restaurant and a cyber equipped with computers with internet connection for research and basic computer training. Approximately 200 people come every day to the Centre and benefit from the various services offered by Maison Shalom.&lt;ref&gt;The New Times, “Oasis of Peace: Giving Burundian refugees new lease of life”, September 2017, http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/read/219159&lt;/ref&gt;

Maison Shalom seeks to help refugees and especially young people in exile to live in dignity, to use the exile for empowerment and to forgiveness for those who forced them to flee their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Maison Shalom, “Oasis of Peace (Maison Shalom) – Restoring Burundian refugees’ hope and dignity in Rwanda”, December 2017, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhApAtfAH0s&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elite Center of Maison Shalom at Mahama refugee camp in Rwanda.jpg|thumb]]

==Mahama Refugee Camp and Mahama Elite Center==
Since 2015, more than 430.000 Burundians have been forced to flee and to seek refuge in neighbouring countries such as Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;UNHCR Burundi Situation, https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/burundi&lt;/ref&gt;  Among them, more than 90.000 are in Rwanda, of which 58.000 live in Mahama refugee camp.&lt;ref&gt;UNHCR Rwanda, “Mahama: Now a Safe Haven for over 50,000 Burundian refugees”, September 2016, http://www.unhcr.org/rw/559-559.html&lt;/ref&gt;  This camp is now considered to be a model case of refugee management in the East African Region.&lt;ref&gt;Bwiza News, “Kirehe : Le Camp De Réfugiés De Mahama Devenu Une Ville Modèle”, Avril 2017, https://francais.bwiza.com/kirehe-le-camp-de-refugies-de-mahama-devenu-une-ville-modele/&lt;/ref&gt;  

To support the refugees living in the camp,&lt;ref&gt;The Official Twitter handle of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugees (MIDIMAR), Tweet of 22nd of June 2018, “Min. @DeBonheurJeanne has inaugurated Mahama Elite Center built by @Maison_Shalom” https://twitter.com/MIDIMARRwanda/status/1010102395479756800&lt;/ref&gt;  Maison Shalom opened the Mahama Elite Center on 22nd of June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Official Facebook Page of Maison Shalom: “Direct Inauguration of the Elite Centre of Maison Shalom at Mahama refugee camp”, https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2054505184591170&amp;id=428511097190595&lt;/ref&gt;

The project will enable young people not only to improve their living conditions but also to strengthen their entrepreneurship skills.&lt;ref&gt;Tele Renaissance, “La Maison Shalom a profité de cette occasion pour lancer le "Mahama Elite Centre", 26 June 2018, (6min02) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf7O6UpA6co&amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marhaenism''' ({{lang-ind|Marhaenisme}}) is a [[socialism|socialistic]] political ideology originating in [[Indonesia]]. An adherent of Marhaenism is known as a '''Marhaenist'''. It was developed by the first [[President of Indonesia]], [[Sukarno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leifer|first1=Michael|title=Dictionary of the modern politics of South-East Asia|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415238755|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some scholars argue that Marhaenism is a variant of [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lev|first1=Daniel S.|title=The transition to guided democracy : Indonesian politics, 1957-1959|date=2009|publisher=Equinox Publishing|location=Jakarta|isbn=978-6028397407|edition=[New ed.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes national unity, culture, and collectivist economics. It was established as an [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] and [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] ideology. It promotes democratic rights in opposition to [[authoritarianism]], while condemning [[liberalism]] and [[individualism]]. It combines both western and eastern principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holt|first1=[edited by] Claire|title=Culture and politics in Indonesia|date=2007|publisher=Equinox Pub.|location=Jakarta|isbn=978-9793780573|edition=1st Equinox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marhaenism is the guiding ideology of the [[Indonesian National Party Marhaenism]] and the now defunct [[Parti Marhaen Malaysia]].

==History==

The name of the ideology is said to be taken that of a land-poor farmer named Marhaen, whom Sukarno met in [[Priangan]]. Sukarno attributed the farmer's poverty to a lack of access to production tools. Sukarno thenceforth took to referring to members of the agrarian class as "Marhaens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Soekarno|title=Pokok-pokok ajaran marhaenisme menurut Bung Karno|date=2004|publisher=Media Pressindo|location=Yogyakarta|isbn=978-9799222923|edition=Cet. 3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19529">The '''missing years''' in the [[Hebrew calendar]] refer to a chronological discrepancy between Talmudic chronologists for the destruction of the [[First Temple]] in 423 BCE (3338 [[Hebrew calendar|AM]])&lt;ref&gt;[[Rashi]] on [[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Avodah Zara'' 9a; [[Josephus]], ''[[Seder hadoroth]]'' year 3338 [[Anno Mundi]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the modern secular dating for it in 587 BCE.

== Destruction of the First Temple ==
{{Main|Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)}}
Both the [[Babylonian Chronicles]] and the biblical Chronicles indicate that [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] captured Jerusalem, but secular scholars have attempted to set a year when the event took place. The Babylonian Chronicles, which were published by [[Donald Wiseman]] in 1956, establish that Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem the first time on 2 Adar (16 March) 597 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;D. J. Wiseman, ''Chronicles of Chaldean Kings in the British Museum'' (London: Trustees of the British Museum, 1956) 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chronicles, with the names of Jewish kings, is derived from [https://web.archive.org/web/20141030154541/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/c/cuneiform_nebuchadnezzar_ii.aspx British Museum – Cuneiform tablet with part of the Babylonian Chronicle (605–594 BC)], (See also [http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc5/jerusalem.html Chronicle Concerning the Early Years of Nebuchadnezzar II] Reverse, lines 11'–13')

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the seventh year (of Nebuchadnezzar, 599 BCE) in the month Chislev (Nov/Dec) the king of Babylon assembled his army, and after he had invaded the land of Hatti ([[Syro-Hittite states|northern Syria and southern Anatolia]]) he laid siege to the city of Judah. On the second day of the month of Adar (16 March) he conquered the city and took the king ([[Jeconiah]]) prisoner. He installed in his place a king ([[Zedekiah]]) of his own choice, and after he had received rich tribute, he set forth to Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;No 24 WA21946, The Babylonian Chronicles, The British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|36:6–10|HE}} says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;6 Against him ([[Jehoiakim]]) came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
7 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
8 ... and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
9 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem...
10 And at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before Wiseman's publication, [[E. R. Thiele]] had determined from the biblical texts that Nebuchadnezzar's initial capture of Jerusalem occurred in the spring of 597 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Thiele, ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'', (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951; 2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). {{ISBN|0-8254-3825-X}}, 9780825438257, 217.&lt;/ref&gt; while other scholars, including [[William F. Albright]], more frequently dated the event to 598 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Strand, "Thiele's Biblical Chronology As a Corrective for Extrabiblical Dates," ''Andrews University Seminary Studies'' 34 (1996) 310, 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the date of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)|first siege of Jerusalem]] in about 597 BCE to the date of the destruction of the First Temple requires resort to biblical sources.

2 Chronicles 36:11 says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;11 Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There has been some debate as to when the second siege of Jerusalem took place. Although there is no dispute that Jerusalem fell the second time in the summer month of Tammuz ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|52:6|HE}}), Albright dates the end of Zedekiah's reign (and the fall of Jerusalem) to 587 BCE, whereas Thiele offers 586 BCE.&lt;ref name=Thiele&gt;Edwin Thiele, ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'', (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951; 2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). {{ISBN|0-8254-3825-X}}, 9780825438257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiele's reckoning is based on the presentation of Zedekiah's reign on an accession basis, which was used for most but not all of the kings of Judah. In that case, the year that Zedekiah came to the throne would be his ''first'' partial year; his first full year would be 597/596 BCE, and his eleventh year, the year Jerusalem fell, would be 587/586 BCE. Since Judah's regnal years were counted from [[Tishrei]] in autumn, this would place the end of his reign and the capture of Jerusalem in the summer of 586 BCE.&lt;ref name=Thiele /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie McFall, “A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles,” ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' 148 (1991) 45.[https://lmf12.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/transguide.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating in Seder Olam Rabbah==

=== Two-year difference within the Hebrew calendar ===
The 2nd century CE rabbinic work [[Seder Olam Rabbah]], which formed the basis of the era counting of the Hebrew calendar, interpreted the  [[prophecy of seventy weeks]] in {{bibleverse||Daniel|9:24–27|HE}} as referring to a period of 490 years, with a "week" being interpreted as a period of seven years, which would pass between the destruction of the [[First Temple|First]] and [[Second Temple]]. This is used to date the destruction of the First Temple to 423 BCE (3338 AM) – about 165 years after the current scholarly dating of the event. The discrepancy between these two dates is referred to as "missing years".

Today, Hebrew dating places the creation of the world near the end of "Year One" AM and afterwards the first year of Adam's life as "Year Two" AM. However, Seder Olam Rabba shows that the Hebrew dating originally counted the first year of Adam's life as "Year Zero" AM. This may mean that the Hebrew dating has shifted in the course of history such that traditional dating of ancient events appears two years earlier than the modern Hebrew dating would be.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Frank, ''Talmudic and Rabbinic Chronology'', 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbinic tradition&lt;ref&gt;[[David Gans]], Tzemach David (צמח דוד).&lt;/ref&gt; says that the First Temple was destroyed in "year 3338" AM and the Second Temple in "year 3828" AM. If there was no calendar shift, the Common Era equivalents would be 423 BCE and 68 CE, respectively. If there was a calendar shift, the destructions would have taken place in our years 3339 and 3829 AM, or in 3340 and 3830 AM, and the Common Era equivalents would be 422 BCE and 69 CE, respectively, or 421 BCE and 70 CE.

If there was no calendar shift, the length of the missing-years period would be 163 years (586 minus 423). If there was a calendar shift, the length of the missing-years period would be 164 or 165 years.

=== The missing years and Daniel ===
A popular explanation for the missing years suggests that the Jewish sages interpreted the prophecy in {{bibleverse||Daniel|9:24–27|HE}} as meaning that there would be 490 years from the destruction of the First Temple to the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] and, working backwards from the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] (in 3828 AM), wrongly dated the destruction of the First Temple (in 3338 AM).

A variation on this argument states that the Jews deliberately altered the dating so that the true date of the "anointed one" ([[Mashiah]]) mentioned in {{bibleverse||Daniel|9:25|HE}} would be hidden. Other apologists&lt;ref&gt;This position was proposed by Rabbi Shimon Schwab in "Comparative Jewish Chronology," in the Ateret Tzvi Jubilee Volume in honor of Rabbi Joseph Breuer (Feldheim 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; have countered with claims that the dating was indeed altered for one or another reason and should be understood as fable, not history.

These explanations come from the ambiguous meaning of the word 'week' in Hebrew, which means 'a heptad', or a group of seven. The Hebrew word for 'week' is used to refer to periods of seven days as well as seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{StrongHebrew|7620}}&lt;/ref&gt; The understanding of this number as referring to 490 years can also be found in Seder Olam. Christians also interpreted these verses as years and connect them to Jesus, although [[Rashi]]'s interpretation is such that it upholds the tradition that the anointed one in question is the Persian king Cyrus.

== Highlighting discrepancies ==

===Mistakes in the Hebrew or secular dating===
If traditional dates are assumed to be based on the standard Hebrew calendar, then the differing traditional and modern secular dating of events cannot both be correct. Attempts to reconcile the two systems must show one or both to have errors.

====Missing reign lengths in the Hebrew dating====
Secular scholars see the discrepancy between the traditional and secular date of the destruction of the First Temple arising as a result of Jewish sages missing out the reign lengths of several Persian kings during the Persian Empire's rule over [[Land of Israel|Israel]]. Modern secular scholars tally ten Persian kings whose combined reigns total 208 years. By contrast, ancient Jewish sages only mention four Persian kings totaling 52 years. The reigns of several Persian kings appear to be missing from the traditional calculations.

==== Missing years in Jewish tradition ====
R' [[Azariah dei Rossi]], in ''Me'or Einayim'' (c. 1573), was likely the first Jewish authority to claim that the traditional Hebrew dating is not historically precise regarding the years before the Second Temple.

R' [[Nachman Krochmal]] in ''Guide to the perplexed of our times'' (Hebrew, 1851) points to the Greek name Antigonos mentioned in the beginning of Avot as proof that there must have been a longer period to account for this sign of Hellenic influence. He posits that certain books of the Bible such as [[Ecclesiastes|Kohelet]] and [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] were written or redacted during this period.

R' [[David Zvi Hoffman]] (1843–1921) points out that the Mishna in Avot (1:4) in describing the chain of tradition uses the plural "accepted from them" even though the previous Mishna only mentions one person. He posits that there must have been another Mishna mentioning two sages that was later removed.

It has been noted that the traditional account of Jewish history shows a discontinuity in the beginning of the 35th century: The account of [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] is complete only until this time. It has been postulated that this work was written to complement another historical work, about subsequent centuries until the time of [[Hadrian]], which is no longer extant.

It appears that Jewish dating systems only arose in the 35th century, so that precise historical records would naturally have existed only from that time onwards. The Minyan Shtarot system, used to date official Jewish documents, started in the year 3449. According to Lerman's thesis, the year-count "from Creation" was established around the same time (see [[Birkat Hachama]]).

It has also been posited that certain calculations in the Talmud compute better according to the secular dating. Two possible harmonizations are proposed by modern rabbis:

* R' [[Shimon Schwab]] points to the words "seal the words and close the book" in the book of Daniel as a positive commandment to obscure the calculations for the Messiah mentioned within.  However, R' Schwab later withdrew this suggestion once it became clear that the whole basis for the dating of the [[sabbatical]] and [[jubilee (biblical)|jubilee]] years would be undermined, labeling it a mere thought experiment.
* An alternative solution suggests that the sages were concerned with the acceptance of the [[Mishna]]. There existed a Rabbinical tradition that the year 4000 marked the close of the "era of Torah". The authors of the [[Ḥakirah (journal)|Ḥakirah]] article propose that the Sages therefore arranged the chronology so that the redaction of the Mishna should coincide with that date and thus have a better chance of acceptance.

====Critiques of secular dating====
Attempts have been made to reinterpret the historical evidence to agree with the Rabbinic tradition (see ''Excursus: Rabbinic Tradition'', below), however this approach to the discrepancy is problematic. The reinterpretation of the Greek, Babylonian and Persian sources that is required to support the traditional dating has been achieved only in parts and has not yet been achieved in its entirety. Similar problems face other attempts to revise secular dating (such as those of [[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]] and [[David Rohl]]) and mainstream scholarship rejects such approaches. Where and how the Gregorian or Julian calendric differential gets factored in, remains another argument entirely.

{{hidden begin|border=1px #aaa solid|title={{center|''Excursus'': '''Rabbinic Tradition'''}}}}

According to the Aramaic '''[[Scroll of Antiochus]]''', from the Second Temple's rebuilding till the 23rd year of the reign of Antiochus Eupator, son of Antiochus Epiphanes who invaded Judaea, there had transpired '''213 years''' in total. Quoting verbatim from that ancient Aramaic record:
 
בִּשׁנַת עַסרִין וּתלָת שְׁנִין לְמִמלְכֵיהּ, בִּשׁנַת מָאתַן וּתלָת עֲסַר שְׁנִין לְבִניַין בֵּית אֱלָהָא דֵיך, שַׁוִּי אַנפּוֹהִי לְמִיסַּק לִירוּשְׁלֵם

Literal translation: ''In the twenty third year of his kingdom, in the two-hundred and thirteenth year of the rebuilding of this, God's house, he (Antiochus Eupator) put his face to go up to Jerusalem.''

This timeframe is taken in conjunction with another date in the [[Seleucid Era]] counting mentioned by [[Josephus]], in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (book 12, chapter 9, section 2). Based on Josephus' record,  Antiochus Eupator began his reign after his father's death (Antiochus Epiphanes) in ''anno'' 149 of the [[Seleucid Era]] (= 162 BCE). Twenty-three years into Antiochus Eupator's reign would have then been ''anno'' 172 of the [[Seleucid Era]], or what was then 139 BCE. Since, according to the [[Megillat Antiochus|Scroll of Antiochus]], the [[Second Temple]] had already been standing 213 years, this means that the [[Second Temple]] was completed in ''anno'' '''352 BCE''', being what was then the 6th year of the reign of [[Darius I|Darius]] the king (i.e. Darius, the son of Hystaspes), the year in which the king finished its building according to Ezra 6:15. Although this date of the Temple's rebuilding largely disagrees with modern scholarship who base their chronologies upon the [[Babylonian Chronicles]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Parker &amp; Waldo H. Dubberstein, ''Babylonian Chronology 626 BC - AD 75'', Providence 1956&lt;/ref&gt; and its rebuilding in 516 BCE, it is, nonetheless, held by religious Jewish circles as being accurate and reliable, since it is founded upon a tradition passed down generation after generation. The [[Babylonian Chronicles]], however, are known to be lacking in certain regnal years ascribed to some kings, besides disagreeing in other places with the ancient Egyptian records outlining the regnal years of eight successive Persian kings, preserved in the [[Manetho|Third Book of Manetho]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Ancient Fragments'', ed. I. P. Cory, Esq., p. 65, London 1828. Manetho was the high priest and scribe of Egypt who wrote down his history for Ptolemy Philadelphus.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jewish tradition, the Second Temple stood '''420 years''',&lt;ref&gt;Tosefta (''Zevahim'' 13:6); Palestinian Talmud (''Megillah'' 18a), ''et al''.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning, it was destroyed by Titus in the 2nd year of the reign of [[Vespasian]], in 68 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Questions &amp; Responsa'', ''responsum'' # 389; in other editions, ''responsum'' # 234 (Hebrew). Maimonides states explicitly this tradition, putting the destruction of the Second Temple in the lunar month Av, in the year which preceded ''anno'' 380 of the Seleucid era (i.e. 68 CE). See also ''She'harim la'luah ha'ivry'' (Gates to the Hebrew Calendar) by Rahamim Sar-Shalom, 1984 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; For a discussion of subject, see [[Seder Olam Rabbah]].

The 2nd century Jewish chronicler wrote in ''[[Seder Olam Rabbah]]'' (chapter 30): "Rabbi Yose says: The kingdom of Persia during the time of the Temple lasted [only] '''34 years'''." Many have misconstrued these words to mean that the author of ''[[Seder Olam Rabbah]]'' has contracted the entire Persian period of over 200 years into a supposed period of 34 years. According to [[Rashi|RASHI]],&lt;ref&gt;RASHI’s commentary on the Bablylonian Talmud (''Avodah Zarah'' 9a, s.v. מלכות פרס בפני הבית)&lt;/ref&gt; the 34-year Persian period must be understood in the context of their hegemony over Israel while the Second Temple stood. Meaning, 34 years is the precise timeframe between the building of the Second Temple under [[Darius I|Darius]] (I) in 352 BCE (according to Jewish calculations) and [[Alexander the Great]]'s rise to power in 318 BCE – collected altogether as 34 years of Persian hegemony over Israel while the Temple stood. This timeframe, therefore, does not signify the end of the dynasties in Persia, but rather of their rule and hegemony over Israel before [[Alexander the Great]] rose to power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2739">The '''Mrs Bistow's Theatre''' also known as '''Chowringhee Theatre''', was an historic theatre in [[Calcutta]] (now named Kolkata) in India, founded in 1787. It was the third theatre in the city of Calcutta. It is known as the first theatre in India to employ actresses. 

The theatre was founded in 1787 by [[Emma Bristow (actress)|Emma Bistow]], married to an English merchant. It was situated in Bistow's residence at the junction at Chowringhee and Theatre Road. Formally named Chowringhee Theatre, it was normally referred to as Mrs Bistow's Theatre after its founder and managing director.  Bistow as considered a competent manager and also as a good actress on her own stage, particularly noted within "comedy and humourous singing".  The Mrs Bistow's Theatre was the third theater in Calcutta after the [[Calcutta Theatre]] and its predecessor, and became one of the two leading stages of Calcutta and a prominent rival stage to Calcutta Theatre. It was the first theatre in India to employ women on stage, which caused its rival stage Calcutta Theatre to employ actresses.  In 1789, Emma Bristow introduced actresses brought from England. &lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.se/books?id=M75aDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT50&amp;lpg=PT50&amp;dq=Emma+Bristow+calcutta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3Tj4mdznz9&amp;sig=e0RbgYCZA01WU542KbIFOGT_WoU&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj9iL34jPLdAhUBpywKHZsSCRcQ6AEwEXoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Emma%20Bristow%20calcutta&amp;f=false Public Women in British India: Icons and the Urban Stage]''&lt;/ref&gt; The theater was closed in 1790 when Emma bristow returned to England. 

The foundation of this theatre was followed by the foundation of a number of more temporary theatres such as the theatres of Chandernagore (1808), The Athenaeum Lower (1812), Kidderpore (1815) and Dum Dum (1817), but it was not truly replaced as a prominent theatre until the foundation of the second theatre known as the [[Chowringhee Theatre]], also known as the "Private Subscription Theatre" on Chowringhee Road (1813-1839).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4918">'''Abu Umar Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Kindi''' ({{lang-ar|أبو عمر محمد بن يوسف الكندي}}) (January 18, 897 – October 16, 961)  was an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] historian.

== Biography ==
A descendant of the [[Arabs|Arab]] tribe of [[Kindah|Banu Kindah]], al-Kindi was born in Egypt to the [[Tujib]] clan. Although few details of his life are known, he is reported to have received an education on the [[Quran]] and [[hadith]] under [[Ali ibn al-Hasan ibn Qudayd]] and [[Al-Nasa'i|Abu Abd al-Rhaman al-Nasa'i]], and was later a transmitter of hadith himself. As a [[faqih]] he belonged to the [[Hanafi]] school of jurisprudence. He died in Fustat in 961 and was succeeded in his literary work by his son Umar.{{sfn|Gordon|2006|p=440}}{{sfn|Rosenthal|1986|p=121}}{{sfn|Guest|1912|pp=5-7}}

Al-Kindi is chiefly famous for his two surviving works, ''Tasmiyat Wulat Misr'' ("The Enumeration of the Rulers of Egypt") and ''Al-Qudat'' ("The Judges"), which together represent a key source of Egyptian provincial history and its political and legal institutions during the early [[Islam]]ic era. ''Rulers'', which provides an account of the governors of Egypt appointed by the [[caliph]]s and the major events that took place during their administrations, covers the period from the Islamic conquest in 641 until the death of [[Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid]] in 946, with a supplemental continuation by an unknown author extending to the coming of the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] in 969. ''Judges'' is dedicated to the succession of Egyptian [[qadi]]s from 661 until 861, with two continuations that extend to the mid-eleventh century. Both works represent an early example of provincial [[historiography]] and have been used extensively by later authors.{{sfn|Gordon|2006|p=440}}{{sfn|Rosenthal|1986|p=121}}{{sfn|Guest|1912|pp=10-13}}

The two works are preserved in a manuscript held by the [[British Museum]]. An edited version was published under the title ''The Governors and Judges of Egypt'' by Rhuvon Guest in 1912.{{sfn|Gordon|2006|p=440}}{{sfn|Rosenthal|1986|p=121}}

== List of works ==
* "The Western Contingents" (''Al-Jund al-Gharbi'' or ''al-Ajnād al-Gharabāʾ'')
* "The Book of the Moat and Rests" (''Kitāb al-Khandaq wa-al-Tarāwīḥ'') — Possibly concerning the moat dug by [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Jahdam al-Fihri]] in 684 to defend [[Fustat]] during the conflict between the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] and [[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr|Zubayrids]]
* "Sites" (''Al-Khiṯaṯ'') — Likely an account of various sites in Fustat
* "The History of the Great Mosque of the People of the Standard" (''Akhbār Masjid Ahl al-Rāyah al-Aẓam'') — Regarding the [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] in Fustat
* "The Life of al-Sari ibn al-Hakam" or "The Life of Marwan ibn al-Ja'd" (''Sīrat al-Sarī ibn al-Ḥakam'' / ''Marwān ibn al-Ja'd'') — Presumably a biography of either the ninth century Egyptian governor [[al-Sari ibn al-Hakam]] or the last Umayyad caliph [[Marwan II|Marwan ibn Muhammad al-Ja'di]]
* "The Book of Clients" (''Kitāb al-Mawālī'') — Likely an account of important Egyptian ''[[mawla|mawali]]''
* "The Enumeration of the Rulers of Egypt" or "The Rulers of Egypt" (''Tasmiyat Wulāt Miṣr'' or ''ʾUmarāʾ Miṣr'')
* "The Judges" (''Al-Quḍat''){{sfn|Rosenthal|1986|p=121}}{{sfn|Guest|1912|pp=8-13}}

Another surviving work, the "Virtues of Egypt" (''Faḍāʿil Miṣr'') is sometimes attributed to al-Kindi, but is believed to have instead been produced by his son Umar.{{sfn|Guest|1912|p=14}}

'''Nikodim''' (or '''Nikodeme''') '''Pavlovich Kondakov''' ({{lang-ru|Никоди́м Па́влович Кондако́в}}; 1&amp;nbsp;(13)&amp;nbsp;November&amp;nbsp;1844, village of [[Khalan]], [[Kursk Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]]– 17 February 1925, [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]), was an art historian, with special expertise in the [[history]] of Russian Christian icons.

==Biography==
Nicodem Pavlovitch Kondakov was born in Russia in 1844, at [[Khalan]] village, [[Kursk Governorate]].  He attended [[Moscow University]] under [[Fedor Buslaev]] from 1861 to 1865.

After graduation he taught in the Moscow Art School.

In 1870 he became a lecturer in the University of Novorossia, [[Odessa]] (now [[Odessa National University]], [[Ukraine]]), and in 1877 a professor there.

From 1888 he taught in [[St. Petersburg University]]. From 1893 he was a member of the [[Russian Academy of Fine Arts]], and from 1898 a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. In 1895 with [[Fyodor Uspensky]] he founded the [[Russian Archaeological Institute of Constantinople]].

During the [[Revolution of 1917]] and the [[Civil War in Russia]] Kondakov lived in [[Odessa]] and [[Yalta]].

In 1920 he emigrated to [[Bulgaria]], and then to [[Czechoslovakia]], where he taught in [[Prague University]] until his death in 1925.

In his first book, on Greek [[manuscript illumination]], published in 1877, Kondakov approached stylistic evolution of eastern Romanesque art  through the use of artistic ideal. He collaborated with [[Salomon Reinach]] in ''Antiquités de la Russie Méridionale'' (1891). His lectures  influenced future historians, among others, [[Michael Rostovtzeff]]. Kondakov wrote numerous works on the history of Ancient Greek, Russian, Georgian and Eastern Roman art. He founded modern method in the history of the art of the Eastern Roman Empire.

The '''Oxford Calculators''' were a group of 14th-century thinkers, almost all associated with [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]; for this reason they were dubbed "The Merton School". These men took a strikingly logico-mathematical approach to philosophical problems.
The key "calculators", writing in the second quarter of the 14th century, were [[Thomas Bradwardine]], [[William Heytesbury]], [[Richard Swineshead]] and [[John Dumbleton]].
These men built on the slightly earlier work of [[Walter Burley]] and [[Gerard of Brussels]].

==Science==
The advances these men made were initially purely mathematical but later became relevant to mechanics. They used [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] logic and physics. They also studied and attempted to quantify every physical and observable characteristic, like heat, force, color, density, and light. Aristotle believed that only length and motion were able to be quantified. But they used his philosophy and proved it untrue by being able to calculate things such as temperature and power.&lt;ref&gt;Agutter, Paul S.; Wheatley, Denys N. (2008) "Thinking About Life"&lt;/ref&gt;
They developed [[Al-Battani]]'s work on trigonometry and their most famous work was the development of the [[mean speed theorem]], (though it was later credited to [[Galileo]]) which is known as "The Law of Falling Bodies".&lt;ref&gt;Gavroglu, Kostas; Renn, Jurgen (2007) "Positioning the History of Science"&lt;/ref&gt; Although they attempted to quantify these observable characteristics, their interests lay more in the philosophical and logical aspects than in natural world. They used numbers to philosophically disagree and prove the reasoning of "why" something worked the way it did and not only "how" something functioned the way that it did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thinking About Life|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-8865-0|editor=Paul S. Agutter, and Denys N. Wheatley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oxford Calculators distinguished [[kinematics]] from [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], emphasizing kinematics, and investigating instantaneous velocity. They first formulated the [[mean speed theorem]]: ''a body moving with constant velocity travels the same distance as an accelerated body in the same time if its velocity is half the final speed of the accelerated body''.

The mathematical physicist and historian of science [[Clifford Truesdell]], wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Truesdell, ''Essays in The History of Mechanics'', (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|The now published sources prove to us, beyond contention, that the main kinematical properties of uniformly accelerated motions, still attributed to [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] by the physics texts, were discovered and proved by scholars of Merton college.... In principle, the qualities of Greek physics were replaced, at least for motions, by the numerical quantities that have ruled Western science ever since. The work was quickly diffused into [[France]], [[Italy]], and other parts of [[Europe]]. Almost immediately, [[Giovanni di Casali|Giovanni di Casale]] and [[Nicole Oresme]] found how to represent the results by geometrical [[Graph of a function|graphs]], introducing the connection between [[geometry]] and the physical world that became a second characteristic habit of Western thought ...}}

In ''Tractatus de proportionibus'' (1328), Bradwardine extended the theory of proportions of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] to anticipate the concept of [[exponential growth]], later developed by the [[Jakob Bernoulli|Bernoulli]] and [[Euler]], with [[interest|compound interest]] as a special case. Arguments for the mean speed theorem (above) require the modern concept of [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]], so Bradwardine had to use arguments of his day. Mathematician and mathematical historian [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]] writes, "Bradwardine developed the [[Boethius|Boethian]] theory of double or triple or, more generally, what we would call 'n-tuple' proportion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Carl B. Boyer, [[Uta Merzbach|Uta C. Merzbach]]|title=A History of Mathematics|publisher= |year= |pages= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyer also writes that "the works of Bradwardine had contained some fundamentals of [[trigonometry]]". Yet "Bradwardine and his Oxford colleagues did not quite make the breakthrough to modern science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Norman F. Cantor|title=In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World it Made
|publisher= |year=2001 |page=122 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most essential missing tool was [[algebra]].

==Thomas Bradwardine==
[[Thomas Bradwardine]] was born in 1290 in [[Sussex]], England. An attending student educated at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], he earned various degrees. He was a secular cleric, a scholar, a [[theologist]], a [[mathematician]], and a [[physicist]]. He became chancellor of the diocese of London and Dean of St Paul's, as well as chaplain and confessor to Edward III. During his time at Oxford, he authored many books including: ''De Geometria Speculativa'' (printed in Paris, 1530), ''De Arithmetica Practica'' (printed in Paris, 1502), and ''De Proportionibus Velocitatum in Motibus'' (printed in Paris in 1495).

Aristotle suggested that velocity was proportional to force and inversely proportional to resistance, doubling the force would double the velocity but doubling the resistance would halve the velocity (VαF/R). Bradwardine objected saying that this is not observed because the velocity does not equal zero when the resistance exceeds the force. Instead, he proposed a new theory that, in modern terms, would be written as (Vαlog F/R), which was widely accepted until the late sixteenth century.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Thakkar|title=The Oxford Calculators|year=2007|url=https://www.academia.edu/2905457/The_Oxford_Calculators/|magazine=Oxford Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==William Heytesbury==
[[William of Heytesbury|William Heytesbury]] was a [[bursar]] at [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton]] until the late 1330s and he administered the college properties in [[Northumberland]]. Later in his life he was a chancellor of Oxford. He was the first to discover the mean-speed theorem, later "The Law of Falling Bodies". Unlike Bradwardine's theory, the theorem, also known as "The Merton Rule" is a probable truth.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
His most noted work was ''Regulae Solvendi Sophismata'' (Rules for Solving Sophisms). ''Sophisma'' is a statement which one can argue to be both true and false. The resolution of these arguments and determination of the real state of affairs forces one to deal with logical matters such as the analysis of the meaning of the statement in question, and the application of logical rules to specific cases. An example would be the statement, "The compound H2O is both a solid and a liquid". When the temperature is low enough this statement is true. But it may be argued and proven false at a higher temperature. In his time, this work was logically advanced.
He was a second generation calculator. He built on Richard Klivingston's "Sophistimata and Bradwardine's "Insolubilia". Later, his work went on to influence Peter of Mantura and [[Paul of Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Longeway|first=John|title=William Heytesbury|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heytesbury/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Richard Swineshead==
[[Richard Swineshead]] was also an English [[mathematician]], [[logician]], and [[natural philosopher]]. The sixteenth-century polymath [[Girolamo Cardano]] placed him in the top-ten intellects of all time, alongside [[Archimedes]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Euclid]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
He became a member of the Oxford calculators in 1344. His main work was a series of treatises written in 1350. This work earned him the title of "The Calculator". His treatises were named ''Liber Calculationum'', which means "Book of Calculations". His book dealt in exhaustive detail with quantitative physics and he had over fifty variations of [[Thomas Bradwardine|Bradwardine]]'s law.

==John Dumbleton==
[[John Dumbleton]] became a member of the calculators in 1338-39. After becoming a member, he left the calculators for a brief period of time to study theology in Paris in 1345-47. After his study there he returned to his work with the calculators in 1347-48. One of his main pieces of work, ''Summa logicae et philosophiae naturalis'', focused on explaining the natural world in a coherent and realistic manner, unlike some of his colleagues, claiming that they were making light of serious endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molland|first=George|date=23 September 2004|title=Dumbleton, John|url=|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter Galison, HSS 2007.jpg|thumb|Peter Galison at the 2007 [[History of Science Society]] meeting]]

'''Peter Louis Galison''' (born May 17, 1955, [[New York City|New York]]) is the Joseph Pellegrino University Professor in [[history of science and technology|history of science]] and [[physics]] at [[Harvard University]].  He received his Ph.D. at Harvard University in both physics and in the history of science in 1983.  His publications include ''Image and Logic:  A Material Culture of Microphysics'' (1997) and ''[[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] Clocks, [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré's]] Maps: Empires of Time''. His most recent book (2007), co-authored with [[Lorraine Daston]], is titled ''Objectivity''.

Before moving to Harvard, Galison taught for several years at [[Stanford University]], where he was professor of history, philosophy, and physics.  He is considered part of the [[Stanford School]] of philosophy of science along with [[Ian Hacking]], [[John Dupré]], and [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]].

Galison developed a film for the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] on the development of the [[hydrogen bomb]], and has done work on the intersection of science with other disciplines, in particular [[art]] (along with his wife, [[Caroline A. Jones]]) and [[architecture]]. He is on the editorial board of ''[[Critical Inquiry]]'' and was a [[MacArthur Fellow]] in 1996.

==Publications==
In ''Image and Logic'', Galison explored the fundamental rift rising in the physical sciences: whether singular, visual accounts of scientific phenomena would be accepted as the dominant language of proof, or whether statistically significant, frequently repeated results would dominate the field. This division, Galison claims, can be seen in the conflicts amongst high-energy physicists investigating new particles, some of whom offer up statistically significant and frequently replicated analysis of the new particle passing through electric fields, others of whom offer up a single picture of a particle behaving—in a single instance—in a way that cannot be explained by the characteristics of existing known particles.

His work with [[Lorraine Daston]] developed the concept of [[mechanical objectivity]] which is often used in scholarly literature, and he has done pioneering work on applying the anthropological notion of [[trading zones]] to scientific practice.

== Documentary films ==
Galison has been involved in the production of three documentary films. The first, ''The Ultimate Weapon: The H-Bomb Dilemma'', was about the political and scientific decisions behind the creation of the first [[hydrogen bomb]] in the United States, and premiered on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] in 2000. The second, ''[[Secrecy (film)|Secrecy]]'', which Galison directed with Harvard filmmaker [[Robb Moss]], is about the costs and benefits of government [[secrecy]], and premiered at the 2008 [[Sundance Film Festival]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20071207175608/http://www.sundance.org/festival/press_industry/releases/2008_films_in_competition.asp] Also from Harvard, [[Ruth Lingford]] worked on the animation for ''Secrecy''.  Galison completed his third documentary film ''Containment'', also directed with Robb Moss, in 2015. It premiered at the 2015 [http://www.fullframefest.org Full Frame Documentary Film Festival], and has been shown at film festivals around the world including in Brazil, Switzerland, and Australia. This documentary investigates governments' attempts to contain a hundred million gallons of deadly radioactive sludge for 10,000 years: how can people warn future generations across this immense time span during which languages, cultures and the environment will continually transform?

'''Peter Mathews''' (born 12 June 1951 in [[Canberra]], Australia) is an [[Australia]]n [[archaeologist]], [[epigrapher]], and [[Mayanist]].

He was a professor at the [[University of Calgary]], and is Co Director of the Naachtun Archaeology Project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.ucalgary.ca/~naachtun/Team/Staff.html#]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716102556/http://people.ucalgary.ca/~naachtun/Team/Staff.html |date=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1979 and 1986 he taught in the Department of Anthropology at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="macfound.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/232/|title=MacArthur Foundation|website=Macfound.org|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a professor of Archaeology and Maya Hieroglyphs at [[La Trobe University]] until his retirement at the end of 2011. He continued to lecture at the university throughout 2012, until his end of tenure in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latrobe.edu.au/udb_public/publicview$p_subjects.queryview?P_SUBJECT_CODE=ARC3AZT&amp;P_SUBJECT_OFFER_YEAR=2012&amp;Z_CHK=50942&amp;P_SUBJECT_CODE_1=ARC3AZT&amp;P_SUBJECT_NAME=&amp;P_SEMESTER=&amp;P_UNIT_CLASS=&amp;P_YEAR_LEVEL=&amp;P_FACULTY=&amp;P_CAMPUS=&amp;P_DISCIPLINE_CODE=&amp;P_SUBJECT_OFFER_YEAR_1=2012&amp;Z_START=&amp;Z_ACTION=NEXT ARC3AZT, 2012], LaTrobe University Subject Database&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated with a B.A. in 1975 from the [[University of Calgary]] where he studied with [[David H. Kelley]], and [[Yale University]] with a MPhil, and PhD, where he studied with [[Michael D. Coe]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/01/world/archeology-team-missing-in-mexico-jungle.html?pagewanted=1 "Archeology Team Missing in Mexico Jungle"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', Sam Dillon, 1 July 1997&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at Yale he was a [[MacArthur Fellowship|MacArthur Fellow]], at the age of 33.&lt;ref name="macfound.org"/&gt;

In the 1960s, he dubbed artifacts to be from an unknown "Site Q", which some think is [[La Corona]]. In 1973, he was invited to the first Mesa Redonda, [[Palenque]] conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayaexploration.org/pdf/interview_mathews.pdf|format=PDF|title=An Interview with Dr. Peter Mathews|website=Mayaexploration.org|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, he and ten Mexican colleagues were attacked, held, and released, near the Maya site of [[El Cayo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/9709/etc/mathews.html "A Run for Their Lives"], ''Archeology'', Anglea M.H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2721">'''Philipp Knipschildt''' (1595 &amp;ndash; September 29, 1657) was a [[jurist]] and [[legal historian]].

== Life ==
Philipp Knipschildt was born in Treisbach ([[Waldeck (state)|Waldeck]]), the son of Melchior Knipschildt and Catharina née Lefart. From c. 1604 he attended school at [[Medebach]] in the [[Duchy of Westphalia]]; as a Protestant, he moved to Sachsenhausen in the Duchy of Waldeck in 1606. He spent several years in [[Bad Wildungen|Wildungen]] and [[Korbach]] before enrolling at the [[Soest, Germany|Soest]] Archigymnasium. He attended the [[University of Giessen]] from 1615 to 1620 before serving as tutor to Prince Charles Ludwig of Pfalz-Veldenz until 1623. Subsequently, he studied at [[Strasbourg]], obtaining his doctoral degree on November 4, 1626 with a study of [[Fideicommissum|fideicommissa]]. He became engaged to Elisabeth Kreidenmann from [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]] that same year.

Now a [[doctor of both laws]], Knipschildt served as legal advisor to the [[Swabia]]n [[Imperial Knight#Organization|Circles]] of Neckar and Kocher, from 1641 onwards as Counsel to Esslingen, where he had taken citizenship in 1629.  He died in [[Esslingen am Neckar]].

His principal writings include a standard work on the early modern constitutional law of the [[Imperial cities]] (''Tractatus politico-historico-juridicus de juribus et privilegiis civitatum imperialium'', Ulm 1657), a large-scale study of the [[Imperial Knight|Imperial nobility]] (''Tractatus politico-historico-juridicus de juribus et privilegiis nobilitatis'', first published in 1693), and a massive manual on the law of fideicommissa (''Tractatus de fideicommissis nobilium familiarum – von Stammgütern'', Ulm 1654 - expanded from his dissertation) which remained a standard reference work until well into the 19th century.

Cutts Howard, ''Genealogy of the Cutts Family of America'', (1892), entry 1390, p.123 at https://archive.org/stream/genealogyofcutts00howa#page/122/mode/2up/search/hong+kong accessed 22 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Westbrook Waldron (consul)]].  Several landmarks were named after him or his brother.  After the expedition was completed Waldron enjoyed some popularity and influence in Washington, D.C.

==Youth==
Born March 28, 1803, the oldest son of [[Daniel Waldron]] and Olive Huske Sheafe,&lt;ref&gt;C.H. Cutts Howard, ''Genealogy of the Cutts Family of America'', (1892), entry 1390, p.123 at https://archive.org/stream/genealogyofcutts00howa#page/122/mode/2up/search/hong+kong accessed 22 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; he would have seen the 1819 bankruptcy of his father, the 1820 loss of the substantial landholdings that his family had possessed continuously since his ancestor [[Richard Waldron]] began to acquire [[Dover, New Hampshire]] holdings in 1635, and the 1821 death of his father.

==Family heirlooms==
By February 1827 he was "of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]]" and he had possession of his ancestor [[Richard Waldron (Secretary)|Richard Waldron's]] papers.&lt;ref&gt;Everett S. Stackpole and Lucien Thompson, ''History of the town of Durham, New Hampshire (Oyster River Plantation) with genealogical notes'', (1913?) vol. 1, p.17 at: https://archive.org/stream/historyoftownofd00stac#page/16/mode/2up/search/russell accessed 6 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1845 he provided Father [[Sebastien Rale]]'s [[strongbox]], another family heirloom, for safekeeping to the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;"September [1855] Meeting" In: ''Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society'', Volume 3, p.40 by Massachusetts Historical Society at: https://books.google.com/books?id=HvYW4PL7yO8C&amp;pg=PA40 accessed 6 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wilkes Expedition==
Waldron was a member of the Wilkes Expedition which in 1840 visited [[Antarctica]].  [[Cape Waldron]] was named after him.

In July 1840 the Wilkes Expedition named a small Fijian island after Waldron.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Wilkes, ''Narrative of the United States exploring expedition: During the ...'', Volume 3, p.286 at: http://www.geology.19thcenturyscience.org/books/1845-Wilkes-Expedition/Vol-III/PDFpages/1845-Wilkes-Expedition-III-0286.pdf accessed 29 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander G. Findlay, ''A Directory for Navigating the Pacific Ocean ...'', London, 1851, Part II, p.935 at: https://books.google.com/books?id=p5tDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA935 accessed 30 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  This island may be more often referred to by its dual name of [[Namotu]] Island.&lt;ref&gt;"Waldron Island (Namotu Island)", http://www.getamap.net/maps/fiji/western/_waldronisland/ accessed 29 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

This expedition also charted much of the west coast of the then-disputed [[Washington state]] coast, including the [[San Juan Islands]] of present-day Washington State.  In May 1841 one of the islands was named [[Waldron Island]].  It is difficult to sort out which Waldron brother lent his name to this island.

The expedition also visited Hawaii where "Purser R. R. Waldron and [[Joseph Drayton]] ventured inside the crater [ [[Kilauea]] Caldera in present day [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]]] and walked on the dome's hot surface until lava oozed through cracks that formed within fifteen feet of them."&lt;ref&gt;DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY -- NAVAL HISTORICAL CENTER

at: http://www.history.navy.mil/ac/exploration/wilkes/wilkes17.html accessed 17 October 2010.  Wilkes' own narrative identifies that personnel from the Vincennes were on the trip to Mauna Loa, and therefore Richard Russell Waldron, purser with the Vincennes, would be the Waldron meant in Wilkes' phrase "Messr's Waldron and Drayton" who ventured into the crater. See Charles Wilkes, ''Narrative of the United States exploring expedition: During the ...'', Volume 4, pp.111, 128 at: https://books.google.com/books?id=NnEaAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA128 accessed 17 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Waldron Ledge, which overlooks the caldera from the eastern rim, is a popular twenty-minute hike from the park visitor's center where rangers often take groups on short talks.&lt;ref&gt;Kathy Morey, "Trip 27 - Waldron Ledge Loop" In: Hawaii Trails: Walks Strolls And Treks on the Big Island, pp.152-4 at: https://books.google.com/books?id=UI1HEiiwoboC&amp;pg=PA152 accessed 17 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Waldron Ledge Hike, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park " at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WP-v62oY10 accessed 17 October 2010 {{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waldron also witnessed a treaty between the United States (signed by Wilkes) and the [[Sultan of Sulu]] in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;TREATY BETWEEN THE SULTAN OF SULU
AND THE UNITED STATES, 1842  http://www.royalsulu.com/history.html {{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201232156/http://www.royalsulu.com/history.html |date=December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Washington, D.C.==
In the months after the conclusion of the Wilkes Expedition, several of the officers found themselves much in demand in [[Washington, District of Columbia|Washington]] society.  "Chief among the widely traveled sailors being adoringly feted was Richard R. Waldron ...."&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Crapol, ''John Tyler: the accidental president'', (2006) p.147 at: https://books.google.com/books?id=Zu6_JDAR0_sC&amp;pg=PA149 accessed 13 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  "...[T]he well-connected Richard Waldron ... was scheduled to dine with Secretary of State [[Daniel Webster]] at the secretary's home that evening [December 24, 1842]."&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Crapol, ''John Tyler: the accidental president'', (2006) p.152 at: https://books.google.com/books?id=Zu6_JDAR0_sC&amp;pg=PA149 accessed 13 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1842 he was among those credited with assisting the delegation from the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]].  They "received encouragement and support from knowledgeable and experienced naval officers, most notably [[Charles Wilkes]] and Richard Waldron, who had traversed the immense reaches of the Pacific Ocean and understood the strategic importance of the [[Hawaiian Islands]].... In all, these [and other] insider contacts paved the way for [[Timoteo Haalilio|Haalilio]] and [[William Richards (Hawaii)|Richards]] to meet on seven occasions with the reluctant and evasive Secretary [[Daniel Webster|Webster]].  Eventually the Hawaiian delegates also succeeded in having an audience with President [[John Tyler|Tyler]] and other members of his cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Crapol, ''John Tyler: the accidental president'', (2006) p.149 at: https://books.google.com/books?id=Zu6_JDAR0_sC&amp;pg=PA149 accessed 13 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Waldron was even linked with [[Julia Gardiner]], future wife of President Tyler.  Before that romance flourished, "it seems [[Julia Gardiner Tyler|Julia]] and sister Margaret often went dancing and that Julia's date sometimes was naval officer Richard R. Waldron, 23, who had been a member of the Pacific explorations of [[John Wilkes|Wilkes]].  Julia considered him too "boyish".&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Emerson Nelson, John Tyler: A Rare Career
(2008), p.137 at:  https://books.google.com/books?id=CfzdJBmCWIsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=John+Tyler&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qMSPTM_jLJOisQOE3-CxDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFAQ6wEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=waldron&amp;f=false accessed 14 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Having passed up Mr. Waldron, Julia Gardiner Tyler became the second wife of President [[John Tyler]] a couple of years later, at the age of 24.

Historian Edward Crapol incorrectly characterizes the then 39-year-old Richard Russell Waldron as a young 23-year-old midshipman&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Crapol, ''John Tyler: the accidental president'', (2006) p.147 at: https://books.google.com/books?id=Zu6_JDAR0_sC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=richard+waldron+(secretary)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hUVIPbcE_r&amp;sig=6Yeaj9WcD_B1IbOzryNI69reZAQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rrCOTJL6D4OksQP3w_yXDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=richard%20waldron%20(secretary)&amp;f=false accessed 13 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in 1842, and Lyle Emerson Nelson follows him in that.&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Emerson Nelson, ''John Tyler: A Rare Career''
(2008), p.137 at:  https://books.google.com/books?id=CfzdJBmCWIsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=John+Tyler&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qMSPTM_jLJOisQOE3-CxDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFAQ6wEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=waldron&amp;f=false accessed 14 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not known whether Waldron appeared very young for his age, or if his youngest brother [[Thomas Westbrook Waldron (consul)|Thomas]] (then 28) was misidentified as him.

==Death==
Waldron died unmarried on October 30, 1846,&lt;ref&gt;C.H. Cutts Howard, ''Genealogy of the Cutts Family of America'', (1892), entry 1390, p.123 at https://archive.org/stream/genealogyofcutts00howa#page/122/mode/2up/search/hong+kong accessed 22 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; four years after the Wilkes Expedition concluded.

==Landmarks==
[[Cape Waldron]] in [[Antarctica]],&lt;ref&gt;"Cape Waldron" In: "Antarctic Gazetteer" (website) at: http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=296 accessed 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps two [[Waldron Island]]s, one in [[Fiji]] and a possible second island in [[Washington state]],&lt;ref&gt;‘was probably intended for Thomas W. Waldron, Captain’s Clerk of the brig Porpoise of the expedition. However, it is possible that two men were honoured in the one name as R. R. Waldron was Purser of the Vincennes, another vessel of the expedition.’ (Meany, E. S. (1923). ''Origin of Washington Geographic Names'', University of Washington Press, Seattle, as cited in Patrick J. M. Waldron, "Waldron Family History", June 30, 2009, pp.5, 8 at: http://www.binary.co.nz/WALDRON3.PDF accessed 5 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; are named after him. [[Waldron Ledge]] overlooking the [[Kilauea]] Caldera in Hawaii is named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7963">[[File:Sampiro.jpg|thumb|Illustration from the ''[[Códice de Batres]]'' representing Sampiro as Bishop of Astorga]]

'''Sampiro''' (''c''. 956 – 1041) was a [[Kingdom of León|Leonese]] cleric, politician, and intellectual, one of the earliest [[chronicle]]rs of [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|post-conquest Spain]] known by name. He was also the [[Bishop of Astorga]] from 1034 or 1035 until his death.

According to some sources he was born at [[Iglesia del Campo]] in the [[El Bierzo|Bierzo]], near [[Cacabelos]], at times confused with [[Sorribas]] because at the time it lay within the latter. &lt;!--- A privilege of [[Ordoño II]] to [[Carracedo]] dating from 995 refers to ''Subripa quae est villa Sampiri'' (Sorribas, which is the town of Sampiro).&lt;ref&gt;''Privilegio de Ordoño II a Carracedo'', a. 995 (in [[Antonio de Yepes]], vol. V, appendix XXIX, p. 448). See also López Valle. The error appears in Alonso and Tomé.&lt;/ref&gt; ---&gt; According to other sources he was born at [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/s/sampiro.htm Brief biography in Spanish.]&lt;/ref&gt; Further, it is uncertain whether all contemporary references to persons named Sampiro refer to the same individual or multiple ones.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez de Urbel.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young man Sampiro entered a monastery, either [[Sahagún]] or [[San Miguel de Camarzana]]. Later he fled to Zamora in light of raids from [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Muslim territory]], and eventually found himself in the royal court at [[León, León|León]]. He served as a [[Notary public|notary]] to [[Vermudo II]] (984–999) and held the highest office at court, that of [[majordomo]], under [[Alfonso V of León|Alfonso V]] (999–1028). He was appointed bishop of Astorga round 1034.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Sampiro's chronicle was composed as a continuation of the ''[[Chronicle of Alfonso III]]'' and as such relates events between the years 866 and 982, when it abruptly stops, though it was evidently written in the early eleventh century. It forms part of the ''Corpus Pelagianum'', a series of histories each continuing the last stretching back to [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''[[Historia Gothorum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Russell (1938), "Chroniclers of Medieval Spain," ''Hispanic Review'', 6(3), 230–1.&lt;/ref&gt; A redaction of the chronicle of Sampiro was incorporated into the ''[[Historia Silense]]''.

Sampiro praises his master, King Vermudo, as "quite prudent [because] he confirmed the laws dictated by [[Wamba, Visigothic king|Wamba]], ordered the opening and studying of the [[Canon law|collection of canons]], loved mercy and justice, and tried to reprove evil and choose the good."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diariodeleon.es/especiales/2004/historialeon/imprimir_noticia.jsp?CAT=0&amp;TEXTO=2965271 La pesadilla de Vermudo, Almanzor.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095849/http://www.diariodeleon.es/especiales/2004/historialeon/imprimir_noticia.jsp?CAT=0&amp;TEXTO=2965271 |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement about the laws of Wamba (''leges a Vambano principe conditas firmavit''), otherwise unknown for his legislative action, is probably an error for [[Egica]], who made a major revision of the ''[[Lex Visigothorum]]'' and who was held by Leonese writers of the time to have been related to Wamba.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Collins]] (1985), "'Sicut lex Gothorum continet': Law and Charters in Ninth- and Tenth-Century León and Catalonia," ''[[English Historical Review]]'', 100(396), 509.&lt;/ref&gt; The later historian [[Pelayo of Oviedo]], who continued Sampiro's chronicle down to his own age, replaced this laudatory section with an attack on the king, bequeathing to historiography the nickname by which Vermudo II is always known: "the Gouty" (''el Gotoso'').

Improvements to the [[steam engine]] were some of the most important technologies of the [[Industrial Revolution]], although steam did not replace water power in importance in Britain until after the Industrial Revolution.  From Englishman [[Thomas Newcomen]]'s [[atmospheric engine]], of 1712, through major developments by Scottish inventor and mechanical engineer [[James Watt]], the steam engine began to be used in many industrial settings, not just in mining, where the first engines had been used to pump water from deep workings. Early mills had run successfully with water power, but by using a steam engine a factory could be located anywhere, not just close to water.  Water power varied with the seasons and was not always available.

In 1775 Watt formed an engine-building and engineering partnership with manufacturer [[Matthew Boulton]]. The partnership of [[Boulton &amp; Watt]] became one of the most important businesses of the Industrial Revolution and served as a kind of creative technical centre for much of the British economy. The partners  solved technical problems and spread the solutions to other companies. Similar firms did the same thing in other industries and were especially important in the [[machine tool]] industry. These interactions between companies were important because they reduced the amount of research time and expense that each business had to spend working with its own resources. The technological advances of the Industrial Revolution happened more quickly because firms often shared information, which they then could use to create new techniques or products.

From mines to mills, steam engines found many uses in a variety of industries. The introduction of steam engines improved productivity and technology, and allowed the creation of smaller and better engines. After [[Richard Trevithick]]'s development of the high-pressure engine, transport-applications became possible, and steam engines found their way into [[steam boat|boats]], [[steam locomotive|railways]], [[traction engine|farms]] and [[steam carriage|road vehicles]]. [[Steam engine]]s are an example of how  changes brought by [[industrialization]] led to even more changes in other areas.

The development of the [[stationary steam engine]] was a very important early element of the Industrial Revolution. However, it should be remembered that for most of the period of the Industrial Revolution, the majority of industries still relied on wind and water power as well as horse and man-power for driving small machines.

==Thomas Savery's steam pump==
{{main|Thomas Savery}}
The industrial use of steam power started with [[Thomas Savery]] in 1698. He constructed and patented in London the first engine, which he called the "Miner's Friend" since he intended it to pump water from mines. Early versions used a soldered copper boiler which burst easily at low steam pressures.  Later versions with iron boiler were capable of raising water about 46 meters (150 feet). The Savery engine had no moving parts other than hand-operated valves. The steam once admitted into the cylinder was first condensed by an external cold water spray, thus creating a partial vacuum which drew water up through a pipe from a lower level; then valves were opened and closed and a fresh charge of steam applied directly on to the surface of the water now in the cylinder, forcing it up an outlet pipe discharging at higher level. The engine was used as a low-lift water pump in a few mines and numerous water works, but it was not a success since it was limited in pumping height and prone to boiler explosions.&lt;ref&gt;

==Thomas Newcomen's steam engine==
{{main|Newcomen atmospheric engine}}
[[File:Newcomens Dampfmaschine aus Meyers 1890.png|thumb|right|250px|Newcomen's atmospheric steam engine]]
The first practical mechanical steam engine was introduced by [[Thomas Newcomen]] in 1712. Newcomen apparently conceived his machine quite independently of Savery, but as the latter had taken out a very wide-ranging patent, Newcomen and his associates were obliged to come to an arrangement with him, marketing the engine until 1733 under a joint patent.&lt;ref&gt;Hulse, David H: The Early Development of the Steam Engine; TEE Publishing, Leamington Spa, UK, 1999 {{ISBN|1-85761-107-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newcomen's engine appears to have been based on [[Denis Papin|Papin's]] experiments carried out 30&amp;nbsp;years earlier, and employed a piston and cylinder, one end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston. Steam just above atmospheric pressure (all that the boiler could stand) was introduced into the lower half of the cylinder beneath the piston during the gravity-induced upstroke; the steam was then condensed by a jet of cold water injected into the steam space to produce a partial vacuum; the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the vacuum on either side of the piston displaced it downwards into the cylinder, raising the opposite end of a rocking beam to which was attached a gang of gravity-actuated reciprocating force pumps housed in the mineshaft. The engine's downward power stroke raised the pump, priming it and preparing the pumping stroke. At first the phases were controlled by hand, but within ten years an escapement mechanism had been devised worked by of a vertical ''plug tree'' suspended from the rocking beam which rendered the engine self-acting.

A number of Newcomen engines were successfully put to use in Britain for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines, with the engine on the surface; these were large machines, requiring a lot of capital to build, and produced about 5&amp;nbsp;hp. They were extremely inefficient by modern standards, but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads, opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper. Despite their disadvantages, Newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the nineteenth century. By 1729, when Newcomen died, his engines had spread to [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]] and [[Sweden]]. A total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired, of which 14 were abroad.  In the 1770s, the engineer [[John Smeaton]] built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements. A total of 1,454 engines had been built by 1800.&lt;!--Rolt and Allen, p 145--&gt;

==James Watt's steam engines==
{{main|Watt steam engine}}
A fundamental change in working principles was brought about by [[James Watt]]. With the close collaboration of [[Matthew Boulton]], he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his [[Watt steam engine|steam engine]] which incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably, the use of a steam jacket around the cylinder to keep it at the temperature of the steam and, most importantly, a steam condenser chamber separate from the piston chamber.  These improvements increased engine efficiency by a factor of about five, saving 75% on coal costs.

The Newcomen engine could not, at the time, be easily adapted to drive a rotating wheel, although Wasborough and Pickard did succeed in doing so in about 1780. However, by 1783 the more economical Watt steam engine had been fully developed into a double-acting rotative type with a [[centrifugal governor]], [[parallel motion]] and [[flywheel]] which meant that it could be used to directly drive the rotary machinery of a factory or mill. Both of Watt's basic engine types were commercially very successful.

By 1800, the firm [[Boulton &amp; Watt]] had constructed 496 engines, with 164 driving reciprocating pumps, 24 serving [[blast furnace]]s, and 308 powering mill machinery; most of the engines generated from 5 to 10&amp;nbsp;hp.  An estimate of the total power that could be produced by all these engines was about 11,200&amp;nbsp;hp.  This was still only a small fraction of the total power generating capacity in Britain by waterwheels (120,000&amp;nbsp;hp) and by windmills (15,000&amp;nbsp;hp); however, water and wind power were seasonably variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Hills| first=Rev. Dr. Richard| title=James Watt Vol 3:  Triumph through Adversity, 1785-819| publisher=Landmark Publishing| place=Ashbourne, Derbyshire, England| year=2006 | page=217| ISBN=1-84306-045-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Newcomen and other steam engines generated at the same time about 24,000&amp;nbsp;hp.

==Development after Watt==
{{see also|Cornish steam engine}}
The development of [[machine tools]], such as the lathe, planing and shaping machines powered by these engines, enabled all the metal parts of the engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn made it possible to build larger and more powerful engines.&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century after the expiration of the Boulton &amp; Watt patent in 1800, the steam engine underwent great increases in power due to the use of higher pressure steam which Watt had always avoided because of the danger of exploding boilers, which were in a very primitive state of development.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/james-watt-monopolist James Watt Monopolist]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until about 1800, the most common pattern of steam engine was the [[beam engine]], built as an integral part of a stone or brick engine-house, but soon various patterns of self-contained portative engines (readily removable, but not on wheels) were developed, such as the [[table engine]]. Further decrease in size due to use of higher pressure came towards the end of the 18th Century when the Cornish engineer, [[Richard Trevithick]] and the American engineer, [[Oliver Evans]], independently began to construct higher pressure (about {{convert|40|psi|atm|lk=out}}) engines which exhausted into the atmosphere, although Arthur Wolf working at the Meux Brewery in London was already experimenting with higher pressure steam, in his efforts to save coal. This allowed an engine and boiler to be combined into a single unit compact and light enough to be used on mobile road and rail [[locomotive]]s and [[steamboat|steam boats]].&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;

Trevithick was a man of versatile talents, and his activities were not confined to small applications. Trevithick [[Richard Trevithick#The Cornish boiler and engine|developed his large Cornish boiler]] with an [[Cornish boiler|internal flue]] from about 1812. These were also employed when upgrading a number of Watt pumping engines, by this time Arthur Wolf had already produced high pressure engines whilst working at Meux brewery in London, in his efforts to improve efficiency, thus saving coal, as he had been  trained by Joseph Bramah in the art of quality control, which resulted in him becoming chief engineer at Harveys of Hayle in Cornwall, by far the largest and leading manufacturer of steam engines in the world.

The [[Cornish engine]] was developed in the 1810s for pumping mines in Cornwall. It was the result of using the exhaust of a high pressure engine to power a condensing engine.  The Cornish engine was notable for its relatively high efficiency.

===The Corliss Engine===
{{main|Corliss steam engine}}
[[File:Corliss engine, Machinery Hall, from Robert N. Dennis collection of stereoscopic views 2.jpg|500px|thumbnail|right|The Corliss Engine displayed at the International Exhibition of Arts, Manufactures and Products of the Soil and Mine of 1876]]

The last major improvement to the steam engine was the [[Corliss engine]].&lt;ref name=Hunter79&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis|title=A History of Industrial Power in the US, 1780-1930, Vol I|date=1979|publisher=The University Press of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Named after its inventor, [[George Henry Corliss]], this [[stationary steam engine]] was introduced to the world in 1849.  The engine boasted a number of desired features, including [[fuel efficiency]] (lowering cost of fuel by a third or more), low maintenance costs, 30% higher rate of power production, high [[thermal efficiency]], and the ability to operate under light, heavy, or varying loads while maintaining high velocity and constant speed.&lt;ref name=rosenberg1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hunter85 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tribe|first1=J|title=Compound Corliss Engines|date=1903|publisher=Milwaukee, Tribe|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burn|first1=D. L.|title=The Genesis of American Engineering Competition, 1850-1870|journal=Economic History Review|date=January 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the engine was loosely based on existing steam engines keeping the simple piston-flywheel design, the majority of these features were brought about by the engine’s unique valves and valve gears.  Unlike most engines employed during the era that were using mainly [[slide valve|slide-valve]] gears, Corliss created his own system that used a wrist plate to control a number of different valves.  Each cylinder was equipped with four valves, with exhaust and inlet valves at both ends of the cylinder.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benett|first1=Stuart|title=A History of Control Engineering 1800-1930|date=1986|publisher=Institution of Engineering and Technology|isbn=0863410472}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Through a precisely tuned series of events opening and closing these valves, steam is admitted and released at a precise rate allowing for linear piston motion. This provided the engine’s most notable feature, the automatic variable cut-off mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Ross|title=Structures of Change in the Mechanical Age: Technological Invention in the United States 1790-1865|date=2009|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=978-0-8018-9141-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This mechanism is what allowed the engine to maintain a set speed in response to varying loads without losing efficiency, stalling, or being damaged.  Using a series of [[cam]] gears, which could adjust [[valve timing]] (essentially acting as a throttle), the engine’s speed and horsepower was adjusted.  This proved extremely useful for most of the engine’s applications.  In the [[textile industry]], it allowed for production at much higher speeds while lowering the likelihood that threads would break.&lt;ref name=Hunter85 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheldon|first1=F. F.|title=Power and Speed in Cotton Mills, Proceedings of the 27th Annual Meeting of the Northeast Cotton Manufacturers Association|date=1892|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In [[metallurgy]], the extreme and abrupt variations of load experienced in [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling mills]] were also countered by the technology.  These examples demonstrate that the Corliss engine was able to lead to much higher rates of production, while preventing costly damages to machinery and materials.  It was referred to as “the most perfect regulation of speed.” &lt;ref name=Corliss1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corliss|first1=G. H.|title=In the Matter of the Petition of George H. Corliss for an Extension of His letters Patent for Improvements in Steam Engines|date=1870|publisher=Providence Press Company|location=Providence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corliss kept a detailed record of the production, collective horsepower, and sales of his engines up until the [[patent]] expired.&lt;ref name=Corliss1 /&gt;  He did this for a number of reasons, including tracking those who infringed on the patent rights, maintenance and upgrade details, and especially as data used to extend the patent.  With this data, a more clear understanding of the engine’s influence is provided.  By 1869, nearly 1200 engines had been sold, totaling 118,500 horsepower.  Another estimated 60,000 horsepower was being utilized by engines that were created by manufacturers infringing on Corliss’s patent, bringing the total horsepower to roughly 180,000.&lt;ref name=Hunter85 /&gt; This relatively small number of engines produced 15% of the United States’ total 1.2 million horsepower.&lt;ref name=Trowbridge1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trowbridge|first1=W. P.|title=Reports on the Water-power of the United States: Statistics of Power and Machinery Employed in Manufactures. 10th U.S. Census|date=1880}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mean horsepower for all Corliss engines in 1870 was 100, while the mean for all steam engines (including Corliss engines) was 30.  Some very large engines even allowed for applications as large as 1,400 horsepower.  Many were convinced of the Corliss engine’s benefits, but adoption was slow due to patent protection.  When Corliss was denied a patent extension in 1870, it became a prevalent model for stationary engines in the [[Secondary sector of the economy|industrial sector]].&lt;ref name=Hunter85 /&gt; By the end of the 19th century, the engine was already having a major influence on the manufacturing sector, where it made up only 10% of the sector’s engines, but produced 46% of the horsepower.&lt;ref name=Trowbridge1 /&gt;   The engine also became a model of efficiency outside of the textile industry as it was used for pumping the [[waterway]]s of [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]] in 1878 and by playing an essential role in the expansion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|railroad]] by allowing for very large-scale operations in rolling mills.&lt;ref name=Hunter79 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hunter85 /&gt;
Many steam engines of the 19th century have been replaced, destroyed, or repurposed, but the longevity of the Corliss engine is apparent today in select distilleries where they are still used as a power source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rasmussen|first1=M|title=Corliss Engine Group Gear Mechanisms Corliss Steam Engine|url=https://archive.org/details/CorlissEngineGroupGearMechanismsCorlissSteamEngine|website=Archive.org|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major Applications==
===Blast furnace power===
In the mid 1750s the steam engine was applied to the water power-constrained iron, copper and lead industries for powering blast bellows. These industries were located near the mines, some of which were using steam engines for mine pumping.  Steam engines were too powerful for leather bellows, so cast iron blowing cylinders were developed in 1768.  Steam powered blast furnaces achieved higher temperatures, allowing the use of more lime in iron blast furnace feed.  (Lime rich slag was not free-flowing at the previously used temperatures.)  With a sufficient lime ratio, sulfur from coal or coke fuel reacts with the slag so that the sulfur does not contaminate the iron.  Coal and coke were cheaper and more abundant fuel.  As a result, iron production rose significantly during the last decades of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R.

===Moving from Water to Steam Power===
[[hydropower|Water power]], the world's preceding supply of power, continued to be an essential power source even during the height of [[steam engine]] popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atack|first1=J|last2=Bateman|first2=F|last3=Weiss|first3=T|title=The Regional Diffusion and Adoption of the Steam Engine in American Manufacturing|journal=The Journal of Economic History|date=1980|volume=40|issue=2|pages=281–308|doi=10.1017/s0022050700108216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steam engine, however, provided many benefits that couldn’t be realized by relying solely on water power, allowing it to quickly become industrialised nations' dominant power source (rising from 5% to 80% of the total power in the US from 1838-1860).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fenichel|first1=A.

===The Steamboat===
{{main|Steamboat}}
This period of economic growth, which was ushered in by the introduction and adoption of the steamboat, was one of the greatest ever experienced in the United States. Around 1815, steamboats began to replace barges and flatboats in the transport of goods around the United States. Prior to the steamboat, rivers were generally only used in transporting goods from east to west, and from north to south as fighting the current was very difficult and often impossible.&lt;ref name=ZimmerOhio&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zimmer|first1=David|title=The Ohio River; Gateway to Settlement|date=1982|publisher=Indiana Historical Society|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-powered boats and rafts were assembled up-stream, would carry their cargo down stream, and would often be disassembled at the end of their journey; with their remains being used to construct homes and commercial buildings.  
[[File:1920 Steamboat on the Yukon River.jpg|thumbnail|left|Steamboat on the [[Yukon River]] in 1920]]
Following the advent of the steamboat, the United States saw an incredible growth in the transportation of goods and people, which was key in westward expansion. Prior to the steamboat, it could take between three and four months to make the passage from New Orleans to Louisville, averaging twenty miles a day.&lt;ref name= ZimmerOhio  /&gt; With the steamboat this time was reduced drastically with trips ranging from twenty-five to thirty-five days. This was especially beneficial to farmers as their crops could now be transported elsewhere to be sold. 
The steamboat also allowed for increased specialization. Sugar and Cotton were shipped up north while goods like poultry, grain and pork were shipped south. Unfortunately, the steamboat also aided in the internal slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Camfield|first1=Gregg|title=Economic Development; Mark Twain's Mississippi|url=http://dig.lib.niu.edu/twain/|website=Mark Twain's Mississippi|accessdate=2014-06-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008052125/http://dig.lib.niu.edu/twain/|archivedate=2014-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
With the steamboat came the need for an improved river system. The natural river system had features that either wasn't compatible with steamboat travel or was only available during certain months when rivers were higher. Some obstacles included rapids, sand bars, shallow waters and waterfalls. To overcome these natural obstacles, a network of canals, locks and dams were constructed. This increased demand for labor spurred tremendous job growth along the rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hedeen|first1=Jane|title=The Economic Impact of the Steamboat|url=http://www.indianahistory.org/teachers-students/teacher-resources/classroom-tools/transportation/Economic%20Impact.pdf|publisher=Indiana Historical Society|accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic benefits of the steamboat extended far beyond the construction of the ships themselves, and the goods they transported. These ships led directly to growth in the coal and insurance industries, along with creating demand for repair facilities along the rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=L.A.|title=History of the Ohio Falls Cities and their Counties: With illustrations and bibliographical sketches|date=1882|publisher=L.A. Williams and Company|location=Cleveland|pages=220|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofohiofal02will#page/220/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally the demand for goods in general increased as the steamboat made transport to new destinations both wide reaching and efficient.

====Steamboat and Water Transport====
After the first steamboat was invented and achieved a number of successful trials, it was quickly adopted and led to an even quicker change in the way of [[water transport]]. 
In 1814, the city of [[New Orleans]] recorded 21 steamboat arrivals, but over the course of the following 20 years that number exploded to more than 1200. The steamboat’s role as a major transportation source was secured.&lt;ref name=sparkles1&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Steamboat on the Mississippi River|url=http://www.mississippiriverinfo.com/history-of-steamboats-on-the-Mississippi-river/|publisher=Mississippi River Cruises|accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The transport sector saw enormous growth following the steam engine's application, leading to major innovations in [[canals]], [[steamboats]], and [[railroads]]. The steamboat and [[canal system]] revolutionized trade of the United States. As the steamboats gained popularity, enthusiasm grew for the building of [[canals]]. 
In 1816, the US had only 100 miles of [[canals]]. This needed to change, however, as the potential increase in traded goods from east to west convinced many that canals were a necessary connection between the [[Mississippi]]-[[Ohio]] waterways with the [[Great Lakes]].

===Railroad===
The use of steam engines on railroads proved to be extraordinary in the fact that now you could have large amounts of goods and raw materials delivered to cities and factories alike. Trains could deliver these to places far away at a fraction of the cost traveling by wagon. Railroad tracks, which were already in use in mines and various other situations, became the new means of transportation after the first locomotive was invented.

A '''term''' is a period of [[wikt:duration|duration]], [[time]] or [[wikt:occurrence|occurrence]], in relation to an [[Phenomenon|event]]. To differentiate an [[Interval (time)|interval]] or duration, common phrases are used to distinguish the observance of [[length]] are near-term or short-term, medium-term or mid-term and long-term.

It is also used as part of a [[calendar]] [[year]], especially one of the three parts of an [[academic term]] and [[employment|working]] year in the [[United Kingdom]]: [[Michaelmas term]], [[Hilary term]] / [[Lent term]] or [[Trinity term]] / [[Easter term]], the equivalent to the [[Academic term#United States|American semester]]. In [[United States|America]] there is a [[United States midterm election|midterm election]] held in the middle of the four-year presidential term, there are also academic [[midterm exam]]s.

In '''[[economics]]''', it is the period required for economic agents to reallocate resources, and generally reestablish [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. The actual length of this period, usually numbered in years or decades, varies widely depending on circumstantial context. During the long term, all factors are variable.

In '''[[finance]]''' or financial operations of borrowing and investing, what is considered ''long-term'' is usually above 3 years, with ''medium-term'' usually between 1 and 3 years and ''short-term'' usually under 1 year.  It is also used in some countries to indicate a fixed term investment such as a [[term deposit]].

In law, the term of a [[contract]] is the duration for which it is to remain in effect (not to be confused with the meaning of "term" that denotes any [[contractual term|provision of a contract]]). A [[fixed-term contract]] is one concluded for a pre-defined time.

==Other terms==

'''''The Cambridge World History''''' is a seven volume [[history of the world]] in nine books published by [[Cambridge University Press]] in 2015. The editor in chief is [[Merry E. Wiesner-Hanks]]. The history takes a [[Comparative history|comparativist]] approach.

==Approach==
Speaking in 2013, the editor of volume three, [[Norman Yoffee]], described the history as being "conceived by a group of world historians, that is people who insist that large indeed global relations are essential in understanding local histories, and they are dedicated comparativists."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIN4FkacusE Norman Yoffee - "Early Cities and the Evolution of History".] FHSSVideos, YouTube, 7 August 2013. 1m.48s. Retrieved 20 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
Each volume is organised as a series of essays with accompanying photographs, illustrations, diagrams and maps. The separate volumes take a thematic and chronologically overlapping approach. The first volume discusses the period before the invention of writing including the [[Paleolithic era]] to 10,000 BCE. The second discusses the development of agriculture and the period 12,000 BCE to 500 CE. Later volumes cover progressively shorter but still overlapping periods.

==Volumes and editors==
The work is in seven volumes over nine books, volumes 6 and 7 being published in two parts each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://universitypublishingonline.org/cambridge/histories/subject_title_list.jsf?subjectCode=04&amp;seriesCode=TCWH&amp;heading=The+Cambridge+World+History&amp;tSort=title+closed&amp;aSort=author+default_list&amp;ySort=year+default_list ''The Cambridge World History''.] Cambridge Histories Online.

'''Thomas Keightley''' (17 October 1789 – 4 November 1872) was an Irish writer known for his works on mythology and folklore, particularly ''Fairy Mythology'' (1828), reprinted as ''The World Guide to Gnomes, Fairies, Elves, and Other Little People'' (1880, 1978, 2000, etc.). Regarded as a pioneer in the study of [[folkloristics|Folklore]] by modern scholars in the field,&lt;ref name="dorson"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dorson|1955}}; Repr. {{Harvnb|Dorson|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was one of the "early and important comparativist collectors" of folklore.&lt;ref name="silver-SSP010"&gt;{{Harvnb|Silver|1998|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A circumspect scholar, he did not deem that similar tales recognizable across countries automatically signified transmission, but allowed that similar tales could arise independently in different cultures.

At the request of the educator [[Thomas Arnold]], he authored a series of textbooks on English, Greek, and other histories, which were adopted at Arnold's [[Rugby School]] as well as other [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]].&lt;ref name="sbdel"&gt;{{Cite SBDEL|wstitle=Keightley, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and travels==
Keightley, born in October 1789, was the son of Thomas Keightley of Newtown, [[County Kildare|co. Kildare]], and claimed to be related to [[Thomas Keightley (official)|Thomas Keightley]] (1650?–1719). He entered [[Trinity College, Dublin]], on 4 July 1803, but left without a degree, and due to poor health he was forced to abandon the pursuit of the legal profession and admission to the [[Irish Bar]].&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Keightley, Thomas (1789-1872)|first=Sidney |last=Lee|authorlink=Sidney Lee|volume=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BCUJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA307|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1824 he settled in London, and engaged in literary and journalistic work.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; Keightley is known to have contributed tales to [[Thomas Crofton Croker]]'s ''Fairy Legends of South Ireland'' (1825), though not properly acknowledged.{{Refn|{{cite book|last=Bates|first=William|title=The Maclise portrait-gallery of illustrious literary characters|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|year=1898|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uco8AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA51|pages=51 (and 42)}}, cited in DNB&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;}} It turned out that he submitted at least one tale ("The Soul Cages") almost entirely of his own fabrication unbeknown to Croker and others.

Having spent time in Italy,&lt;ref&gt;''Notes on the Bucolics'' (1846), Preface&lt;/ref&gt; he was capable of producing translations of tales from ''[[Pentamerone]]'' or ''[[The Nights of Straparola]]'' in ''Fairy Mythology'', and he struck up a friendship with the patriarch of the [[Gabriele Rossetti|Rossetti]] household. Thomas claimed to be literate in twenty-odd languages and dialects in all,&lt;ref name="dorson-1955-p6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dorson|1955|p=6}}; repr. {{Harvnb|Dorson|1999|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published a number of translations and digests of medieval and foreign works and passages, often sparsely treated elsewhere in the English language, including the expanded prose versions of ''[[Ogier the Dane]]'' which conveys the hero to [[Morgan le Fay]]'s [[Fairyland]], or [[Sveriges Medeltida Ballader|Swedish ballads]] on [[Neck (water spirit)|nix]]es and [[Elf|elves]], such as ''[[Harpans kraft]]'' ("Power of the Harp") and ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Herr Olof och älvorna|2=sv|preserve=1}}'' ("Sir Olof in Elve-Dance").&lt;ref&gt;''Fairy Mythology'' (1850), 150-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythological works==

===Fairy Mythology===
In 1828 Keightley published ''Fairy Mythology,'' 2 vols., illustrated by [[William Henry Brooke|W. H. Brooke]]. A German translation by {{Interlanguage link multi|Oskar Ludwig Bernhard Wolff{{!}}Wolff|2=de|3=O. L. B. Wolff|preserve=1}} ''Mythologie der feen und elfen'' (1828) quickly appeared. [[Jacob Grimm]] is said to have praised the work.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; It was popular among Victorian folklore researchers and literary figures in its day; an expanded edition appeared in 1850, and a newly prefaced one in 1860.&lt;ref name="silver-SSP029"&gt;{{Harvnb|Silver|1998|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently been reissued intermittently up to modern times,&lt;ref name="feldman443"&gt;{{Harvnb|Feldman|Richardson|1972|pp=443-}}&lt;/ref&gt; to an extent vindicating Keightley's own "high hopes of immortality for his work" in his preface, despite an early biographer calling this "pretentious".{{Refn|"pretentious preface," Lee in DNB&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;}}

Keightley is regarded as an early practitioner in England of the [[Brothers Grimm]]'s approach to the study of myth and folklore, exploring the parallels between the myth of a nation to the religions and mythology of other regions.&lt;ref name="feldman443"/&gt; Thus Keightley began by attempting to trace [[fairy|fairy myth]] to Gothic and Teutonic roots, as the Grimms had done for [[Elf|elves]].&lt;ref name="silver-SSP029"/&gt; Keightley, like the Grimms, eventually reached the conclusion that it was implausible to trace a myth to an ultimate single source, and that parallel myths can be explained by the "[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] idea that human nature [that] is uniform," and similar experiences and responses are shared across mankind.&lt;ref name="feldman443"/&gt;

A selection in ''Fairy Mythology'' was an Irish mermaid story entitled "The Soul Cages," which turned out to be a hoax of sorts. The male [[merrow]] story was first printed in Croker's anthology, but Keightley came out with a later edition of the ''Fairy Mythology'' he added a footnote to this tale, proclaiming he "must here make an honest confession," and informed the reader that except for the kernel of the story adapted from the German story of "The Peasant and the Waterman", this Irish tale was entirely his invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keightley|1850|loc=''The Fairy Mythology'', New Edition, 536n}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Markey|2006|pp=27–28}}: &lt;!--quote--&gt;one of "Croker's collaborators, Thomas Keightley (1789–1872), played an elaborate confidence trick on Croker, Grimm, and subsequent commentators on ''The Soul Cages''".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Keightley (1850), ''Fairy Mythology'' p.536, continues that, as it turned out, Irishmen in Counties Wicklow and Cork were familiar with such a soul-trapping story, except that  "It was things like flower-pots he kept them in."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythology of Ancient Greece===
Keightley's [[wikt:bowdlerized|bowdlerized]] ''The Mythology of Ancient Greece and Italy for the Use of School'' (1831) was applauded by [[Connop Thirlwall|Thirlwall]] for making the subject "fit for ladies." In it, [[Cronus]]'s use of the [[adamant]] sickle (''[[harpe|harpē]]'') to emasculate his father has been euphemized as an act of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] being "mutilated."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Turner|first= Frank Miller|title=The Greek Heritage in Victorian Britain|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1981|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KfbEsQ5WkdUC&amp;pg=PA81|page=81|isbn=0300032579}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;As another example, Keightey's translation of the Italian tale "[[The Dragon (fairy tale)|The Dragon]]" skips over a sexually charged passage, given in [https://books.google.com/books?id=jC6PH66sTxQC&amp;pg=PA134 Canepa (1999), p.134] "it wasn't necessary to bathe the instrument of death with the same blood with which he had bathed the instrument of life," i.e., the king decided against spilling the maiden's blood with dagger when he has just bloodied his "instrument" by deflowering her.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that Keightley took a more historico-scientific, as opposed to theological approach to [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref name="feldman443"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1981|p=87n19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|The "scientific" approach espoused by [[Karl Otfried Müller|K. O. Müller]] and [[Christian Lobeck|C. A. Lobeck]], as observed by [[Robert D. Richardson]]&lt;ref name="feldman443"/&gt;}}

===Tales and Popular Fictions===
Keightley's ''Tales and Popular Fictions; their Resemblances and Transmissions from Country to Country,'' appeared in 1834.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; He divided the book into three parts, tales which he believed were transmitted to Europe from the Middle East, tale groups demonstrating striking similarity but which he thought were independently conceived, and those which confounded him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dorson|1955|p=8}}; repr. {{Harvnb|Dorson|1999|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical works==
Keightley was long occupied in compiling historical manuals for instructional use and popular enlightenment. His ''Outlines of History'' was one of the early volumes of [[Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopædia|Lardner's ''Cabinet Cyclopædia'']] (1829). His ''History of the War of Greek Independence'' (1830) forms volumes lx. and lxi. of ''[[Constable's Miscellany]].''&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

After the ''Outlines,'' Keightley was urged by the educator [[Thomas Arnold]] of [[Rugby School]] to undertake work on a series of mid-sized histories to be used in schools.&lt;ref name="sbdel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fm1850-pref-xiii"&gt;Preface to ''Fairy Mythology'' (1850 edition), p.xii&lt;/ref&gt; ''History of England'' (1837–39), 2 vols., although based on [[John Lingard]], was intended to counteract that writer's catholic tendencies.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; Other textbooks followed: ''History of Greece'' (1835); Rome (1836); Roman Empire (1840); India in (1846–7). His ''History of Greece'' was translated into modern Greek.&lt;ref name="sbdel"/&gt; Keightley also compiled as a study tool ''Questions on Keightley's History of Greece'' and Rome (1836), and one on English history (1840) consisted of a long list of history quizzes organized by chapter, for young students of his Roman, Greek, and histories.

Keightley stated he sought to create history material for the schoolroom which were an improvement on [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''History'', thought himself equal to the task, and found his proof when his titles were "adopt(ed).. immediately on their appearance" by "[[Eton College|Eton]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], Rugby, [[Winchester College|Winchester]], and most of the other great [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]], besides a number of private ones."&lt;ref&gt;Keightley, preface to ''Mythology of Ancient Greece and Italy'' (2nd ed., 1838), p.iv, cited by {{Harvnb|Dorson|1955|p=5}}; repr. {{Harvnb|Dorson|1999|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850, Keightley wrote immodestly of his historical output as "yet unrivalled, and may long be unsurpassed."&lt;ref name="fm1850-pref-xiii"/&gt; Keightley's ''History of Rome'' was derivative of the labors of the German classical historian [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]], and Keightley's patron or mentor Arnold was a subscriber of Niebuhr's approach.&lt;ref&gt;"(Criticism on Books) ''A History of Rome'' by Dr. Leonard Schmitz (1847)", in The British Quarterly Review (1847), Vol. 6 [https://books.google.com/books?id=IAgYAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA280]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Warren (English lawyer)|Samuel Warren]], in his ''Legal Studies,'' 3rd ed. 1854 (i. 235–6, 349), highly praises his historical work.  But he ludicrously overestimated all his performances, and his claim to have written the best history of Rome in any language, or to be the first to justly value Virgil and Sallust, could not be admitted by his friends. During the last years of his life he received a pension from the civil list. He died at Erith, Kent, on Nov 4, 1872.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

Besides the works already mentioned Keightley was author of ''The Crusaders, or Scenes, Events, and Characters from the times of the Crusaders'' (1834). His ''Secret Societies of the Middle Ages'' (''[[Library of Entertaining Knowledge]]'' 1837) was initially published anonymously, and against his wish,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Notes and Queries]]'', 4th ser. ix. 359, 435, 489, 541.&lt;/ref&gt; and later reprinted in 1848.

==Literary criticisms==
Keightley edited [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Bucolics]] and [[Georgics]]'' (1847), which was prefigured by his ''Notes on the Bucolics and Georgics of Virgil with Excursus, terms of Husbandry, and a Flora Virgiliana,'' (1846).  Other Latin classics he edited were [[Horace]], ''Satires and Epistles'' (1848), Ovid, ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' (1848), and [[Sallust]], ''Catilina and Jugurtha'' (1849).&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

===Milton studies===
Keightley produced an annotated edition of Milton (2 vols. 1859) as well as his critical biography ''Account of the Life, Opinions, and Writings of John Milton, with an Introduction to Paradise Lost'' (1855).&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; His nuggets of insight have been occasionally invoked, compared, and contradicted in studies into the 20th century and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Viswanathan |first=S. |chapter=2 |title=Essays in Interpretation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqPHGNbniV8C&amp;pg=PA27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He is listed among the "distinguished file" in one  survey of past commentaries on Milton, going back three centuries ({{Harvnb|Miner|Moeck|Jablonski|2004}}).&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;{{citation|last1=Miner |first1=Earl Roy |last2=Moeck |first2=William |last3=Jablonski |first3=Steven Edward |title=Paradise Lost, 1668-1968: Three Centuries of Commentary |publisher=Associated University Press |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SuXWhYuz3NsC|isbn=0838755771}}. Keightley is given among the "distinguished" alongside [[David Masson]]'s edition of 1890, A. W. Verity's editions (1921-29), Merritt Y. Hughes's edition (1957, etc.), and [[Alastair Fowler]], though "[t]hese names do not exhaust the commentators used" in this survey.&lt;/ref&gt;

Appreciation of allusions in Milton's poems require familiarity with classical Greco-Roman mythology and epics; to borrow the words of an American contemporary [[Thomas Bulfinch]]: "Milton abounds in .. allusions" to classical mythology, and especially "scattered profusely" throughout Milton's ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bulfinch, ''Age of Fable'' (1855), preface, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Keightley was one annotator who meticulously tracked Milton's mythological sources.&lt;ref&gt;"If any one desires to see all the defects of Milton's Latinity and Classical imagery, one has only to consult the notes of the careful Keightley, who with a housewifely solicitude peers into every line and sweeps up whatever is not quite proper there," {{cite journal|last=Rand |first=Edward Kennard |title=Milton in Rustication |journal=Studies in Philology |volume=19 |number=2 |year=1922 |pages=109–135 |format=snippet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzY5AAAAMAAJ}} ({{JSTOR|4171821}})&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Keightley's flawed commentary have been pointed out.  He argued that Milton erred when he spoke of "Titan, Heaven's first-born," there being no single divine being named Titan, only a race of [[Titan (mythology)|titans]]. Though that may be so according to the genealogy laid out by [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', it has been pointed out that Milton could well have used alternate sources, such as [[Lactantius]]'s ''Divinae Institutiones'' ("Divine Institutes"), which quotes [[Ennius]] to the effect that [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] had two sons, Titan and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osgood |first=Charles G. |title=Milton's Classical Mythology |journal=Modern Language Notes |volume=16 |number=5 |date=May 1901 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1bWRdMT8trcC&amp;pg=PA141|pages=282–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise regarding Milton's [[angelology]], Keightley had made some correct observations, but he had constrained the source mostly to the Bible, and made mistakes, such as to identify the angel [[Ithuriel]] as a coinage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=West|first=Robert H.|title=The Names of Milton's Angels|journal=Studies in Philology|volume=47|number=2|date=Apr 1950|pages=211–223}} ({{jstor|4172929}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other commentary===
Keightley also published an unannotated edition of Shakespeare (6 vols. 1864), followed by a study guide entitled ''Shakespeare Expositor: an aid to the perfect understanding of Shakespeare's plays'' (1867).&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

Keightley is credited with first noticing that Chaucer's [[Squire's Tale]] is paralleled by, and hence may have drawn from, the Old French romance, [[Adenes Le Roi]]'s ''Cléomadès''.&lt;ref&gt;''Tales and Popular Fictions'' (1834)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DiMarco|first=Vincent|title=Richard Hole and the "Merchant's" and "Squire's Tales": An Unrecognized Eighteenth-Century (1797) Contribution to Source and Analogue Study|journal=The Chaucer Review|volume=16|number=2|date=Fall 1981|pages=171–180}} ({{JSTOR|2509378}})&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote of [[Henry Fielding]]'s peculiarism of using the antiquated "hath" and "doth" ( ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'', 1858), without acknowledging a commentator who made the same observation before him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Coley|editor-first=W. B. |chapter=Appendix VI: Fielding's Use of hath and doth|title=The True Patriot and Related Writings|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|year=1987|isbn=0819551279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Friends and family==
Keightley, a friend to [[Gabriele Rossetti]], and firm supporter of the latter's views on [[Dante]] became one of a handful of non-Italians who socialized with the family in the childhood days of [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and his siblings. Keightley's ''Fairy Mythology'' was one of the books Dante Gabriel pored over until age ten.

[[William Michael Rossetti]]'s ''Memoir'' notes that Keightley had as "his nephew and adopted son, Mr. Alfred Chaworth Lyster" who became a dear friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Rossetti|first=William Michael|title=Dante Gabriel Rossetti: his family-letters; with a Memoir|volume=1|publisher=Ellis and Elvey|year=1895|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-VNbAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA44|pages=44, 60}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pen and ink likeness of this nephew by Dante Gabriel Rossetti exists, dated 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Surtees, ''Catalogue Raisonné'' , vol. 1, 172 (no. 348). Cited in {{citation|last=Thirlwell|first=Angela|title=William and Lucy: The Other Rossettis|page=332 (note1 to Ch. 3)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-RiQyH57rwUC&amp;pg=PA332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Rossetti Archive: [http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/s348.rap.html Alfred Chaworth Lyster]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Alfred Chaworth Lyster was the father of Dr. [[Cecil Robert Chaworth Lyster|Cecil R. C. Lyster]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u881AQAAMAAJ Notes &amp; Queries, (1921), p.410]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Writings from the Rossetti family provide some other loose information on Keightley's related kin or on his later private life.  A record by William Rossetti of a spiritual séance at Keightley's home at [[Belvedere, London|Belvedere]] on 4 January 1866, amusing in its own right, identifies "two Misses Keightley" in attendance, a kinsman named "William Samuel Keightley" who died in 1856 supposed to have made his spiritual presence in the session.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Rossetti|first=William Michael|title=Rossetti Papers, 1862-1870|publisher=C. Scribner's sons|year=1903|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7MMAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA165|pages=165-}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been remarked that by this period, Keightley had become as "stone-deaf" as [[Seymour Kirkup]], a person who was corresponding with Keightley on matters of spiritualism and visions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rossetti|1903|loc=''Rossetti Papers'', p.170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is a timeline of relevant events preceding, during, and after the wars.

==Timeline==

===Tito-era===
'''1945'''
:The victorious resistance army known as the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] form [[Yugoslavia]], a [[communist]] union of several nations.
'''1948–1952'''
:[[Tito–Stalin split]] leads to Yugoslavia breaking away from [[Moscow|Moscow's]] influence.
'''1966'''
:Yugoslav leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] removes [[Aleksandar Ranković]], an intelligence officer and main Serbian cadre, from his position. A purge of Serbian cadres from the establishment follows.
'''1968'''
:Protests in 1968 are echoed in Yugoslavia. The protests are partially student demonstrations. In Kosovo, demonstrators demand greater rights for the Albanian people. Ailing Tito, in his late seventies, allows some liberalization, but despite his old age, refuses to retire.
:Croatian terrorists plant bombs at cinemas; several people die.
'''1971'''
:Nationalist demonstrations in Croatia, known as the [[Croatian Spring|Croatian Spring or MASPOK]], occur. Tito and the communist government condemn the demonstrations. Many radical nationalists were later convicted for hate-speech, including [[Stjepan Mesić|Stipe Mesić]] and [[Franjo Tuđman|Franjo Tudjman]]. A government crisis follows.
:A group of Croatian neo-Ustashas from Australia infiltrates Yugoslavia and begins planning terrorist attacks, but their actions are prevented and the group is destroyed.
'''1972'''
:Yugoslavian Airways (JAT) [[JAT Flight 364|Flight 364]] is downed by the [[Ustaše]]; 23 of the 24 on board are killed. [[Vesna Vulović]], a stewardess, is the only survivor after more than a 10,000 meter freefall.{{Dubious|Flight 364|date=January 2011}}
'''1974'''
:[[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|A new constitution]] of Yugoslavia is proclaimed, which grants more power to federal units and to the autonomous provinces Kosovo and Vojvodina of Serbia, giving them a vote in all relevant decisions in the federal government. It was aimed at addressing grievances of non-Serb nations within Yugoslavia, under what later became known as the ''weak Serbia, strong Yugoslavia'' concept. [[Bosnian Muslims]] (after 1993 the name was changed to Muslim-Bosniacs, and finally to [[Bosniaks]]) were recognized as a sixth "nation" of Yugoslavia (note: "nations" or officially: "narodi" were Slavic majority peoples, while "nationalities" of officially "narodnosti" were all other national minorities) and one of the three constituent peoples of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].
'''May 1980'''
:[[Josip Broz Tito]] dies.

===Fall of communism===
'''1981'''
:An economic crisis in Yugoslavia begins. Albanian nationalist demonstrations in Kosovo, demanding the status of a republic and more rights (the slogan "Kosovo republika" which translates to "Republic of Kosovo" or more literally "Kosovo republic"). Demonstrations are suppressed and condemned by all Yugoslav communists, including Albanian communists from Kosovo, calling them counterrevolutionary. Arrests follow.
'''1983'''
:A group of Bosnian Muslim nationalists are convicted under a Yugoslav law that prohibited spreading international hatred. Among them is [[Alija Izetbegović]] who was, among other things, tried for his [[Islamic Declaration]].
'''1986–1989'''
:A controversial memorandum from the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] protests the status of [[Serbia]] in [[Yugoslavia]].
:Serb [[chetnik]] ([[archduke]]) [[Momčilo Đujić]] (in emigration), promotes [[Vojislav Šešelj]] to Chetnik duke by declaration in the USA on [[Vidovdan]], 28 June 1989, a Serbian religious holiday. In his instructions to Šešelj, Đujić orders him to "expel all Croats, Albanians and other foreign elements from the holy Serb ground".&lt;ref&gt;Philip J. Cohen: World War II and modern Chetniks. Their historical-political continuity and effects to stability of the Balkans, Zagreb: Ceres, 1997. (Twolingual Croatian-English edition)&lt;/ref&gt;
:Perceived prosecution of Serbs by Kosovo Albanians fuels growing Serbian nationalist sentiment. Additional police forces are sent to Kosovo.
:[[Slobodan Milošević]], a high government official at the time, gives a speech to a small group of Kosovo Serbs where he promises that "no one will beat them", which is aired in the main television news programme. Milosevic instantly becomes very popular in Serbia.
:Milošević rises to power in Serbia.
:''[[Antibureaucratic revolution]]'' demonstrations bring pro-Milošević governments to Vojvodina, Kosovo and Montenegro.
:Kosovo Albanian miners [[1989 Kosovo miners' strike|strike in the Stari Trg mine]]. The Slovenian government holds a large rally in the Cankar Congress Centre, supporting the Albanians of Kosovo.

According to the 10th-century ''[[Suda]]'' lexicon, a [[patrikios|patrician]] Trajan flourished under emperor [[Justinian II]] (r. 685–695, 705–711). Trajan wrote a [[chronicle]], which was "very admirable" (''Suda'' T 901). The ''Suda'' describes him as "a most faithful Christian and most Orthodox". The chronicle is commonly believed to have covered the period from the late 7th century (likely 668) to ca. 713 or 720, and was probably used by [[Theophanes the Confessor]] and [[Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople]] as a common source for their own chronicles.

'''Transnationalism''' is a [[social phenomenon]] and scholarly research agenda grown out of the heightened interconnectivity between [[people]] and the receding economic and social significance of boundaries among nation states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham|first=Pamela|title=Reimagining the Nation and Defining the District: Dominican Migration and Transnational Politics|year=1997|publisher=Patricia Pessar|location=Caribbean Circuits: New Directions in the Study of Caribbean Migration, Center for Migration Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levitt|first=Peggy|title=The Transnational Villagers|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vertovec|first=Steven|title=Transnationalism and Identity|journal=Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies|year=2001|volume=27|issue=4|pages=573–582|doi=10.1080/13691830120090386|url=http://aprendeenlinea.udea.edu.co/revistas/index.php/estudiospoliticos/article/view/21942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castles|first=Stephen|title=Global Perspectives on Forced Migration|year=2005|publisher=Refugee Studies Centre|location=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Trans-National" was popularized in the early 20th century by writer [[Randolph Bourne]] to describe a new way of thinking about relationships between cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bourne|first=Randolph S.|title=Trans-National America |journal=Atlantic Monthly |issue=118| pages=86–97|year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term itself was coined by a colleague in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bourne|first=Randolph S.|title=The Jew and Tran-national America|year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merriam-Webster Dictionary states 1921 was the year the term "transnational" was first used in print, which was after Bourne's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/transnationalism | title=Definition of TRANSNATIONALISM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transnationalism as an [[economic]] process involves the global reorganization of the production process, in which various stages of the production of any product can occur in various countries, typically with the aim of minimizing costs.  Economic transnationalism, commonly known as [[globalization]], was spurred in the latter half of the 20th century by the development of the internet and wireless communication, as well as the reduction in global transportation costs caused by [[containerization]].  [[Multinational corporations]] could be seen as a form of transnationalism, in that they seek to minimize costs, and hence maximize profits, by organizing their operations in the most efficient means possible irrespective of political boundaries.

Proponents of capitalists transnationalism seek to facilitate the flow of people, ideas, and goods among [[regions]]. They believe that it has increasing relevance with the rapid growth of capitalist globalization. They contend that it does not make sense to link specific nation-state boundaries with for instance migratory [[labor force|workforces]], globalized [[corporation]]s, global money flow, global information flow, and global scientific cooperation.

However, critical theories of transnationalism have argued that transnational capitalism has occurred through the increasing monopolization and centralization of capital by leading dominant groups in the global economy and various power blocs.  Scholars critical of global capitalism (and its global ecological and inequality crises) have argued instead for a transnationalism from below between workers and co-operatives as well as popular social and political movements.{{sfn|Robinson|2004}}

Transnationalism as concept, theory and experience has nourished an important literature in social sciences. In practice transnationalism refers to increasing functional integration of processes that cross-borders or according to others trans bordered relations of individuals, groups, firms and to mobilizations beyond state boundaries. Individuals, groups, institutions and states interact with each other in a new global space where cultural and political characteristic of national societies are combined with emerging multilevel and multinational activities. Transnationalism is a part of the process of capitalist globalization. The concept of transnationalism refers to multiple links and interactions linking people and institutions across the borders of [[nation-states]]. Although much of the more recent literature has focused on popular protest as a form of transnational activism, some research has also drawn attention to clandestine and criminal networks, as well as foreign fighters, as examples of a wider form of transnationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Cerwyn|date=2015-05-27|title=Foreign Bodies: Transnational Activism, the Insurgency in the North Caucasus and "Beyond"|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence|volume=27|issue=3|pages=395–415|doi=10.1080/09546553.2015.1032035|issn=0954-6553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that [[diaspora]]s, such as the [[overseas Chinese]], are a historical [[wiktionary:Precursor|precursor]] to modern transnationalism. However, unlike some people with transnationalist lives, most diasporas have not been voluntary. The field of [[diaspora politics]] does consider modern diasporas as having the potential to be transnational political actors and be influenced by transnational political forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kislev|first=Elyakim|title=The transnational effect of multicultural policies on migrants' identification: the case of the Israeli diaspora in the USA|doi=10.1111/glob.12043|volume=15|year=2014|journal=Global Networks|pages=118–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the term "transnationalism" emphasizes the ways in which nations are no longer able to contain or control the disputes and negotiations through which social groups annex a global dimension to their meaningful practices, the notion of diaspora brings to the fore the racial dynamics underlying  the [[international division of labor]] and the economic turmoil of [[global capital]]. In an article published in 2006, Asale Angel-Ajani claimed that "there is the possibility within [[diaspora studies]] to move away from the politically sanitized discourse that surrounds transnational studies". Since [[African diaspora]] studies have focused on [[racial formation]], [[racism]], and [[white supremacy]], [[diaspora theory]] has the potential to bring to transnationalism "a varied political, if not radical political, perspective to the study of transnational processes and—globalization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Angel-Ajani|first=Asale|chapter=Displacing Diaspora: Trafficking, African Women, and Transnational Practices|title=Diasporic Africa: A Reader|year=2006|publisher=New York University Press|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What drives transnationalism ==

Different approaches have attempted to explain this. Some argue that the main driver of transnationalism has been the development of technologies that have made transportation and communication more accessible and affordable, thus dramatically changing the relationship between people and places. It is now possible for immigrants to maintain closer and more frequent contact with their home societies than ever before.
However, the integration of international migrations to the demographic future of many developed countries is another important driver for transnationalism. Beyond simply filling a demand for low-wage workers, migration also fills the demographic gaps created by declining natural populations in most industrialized countries. Today, migration accounts for 3/5 of population growth on western countries as a whole. And this trend shows no sign of slowing down. 
Moreover, global political transformations and new international legal regimes have weakened the state as the only legitimate source of rights. [[Decolonization]], coupled with the fall of [[communism]] and the ascendance of [[human rights]], have forced states to take account of persons qua persons, rather than persons qua citizens. As a result, individuals have rights regardless of their citizenship status within a country.
Others, from a neo-marxist approach, argue that transnational class relations have come about which have occurred concomitant with novel organizational and technological advancements and the spread of transnational chains of production and finance.

== Immigrant transnational activities ==

When immigrants engage in transnational activities, they create "social fields" that link their original country with their new country or countries of residence. "We have defined transnationalism as the process by which immigrants build social fields that link together their country of origin and their country of settlement".{{sfn|Schiller|Basch|Blanc-Szanton|1992|p=1}} These social fields are the product of a series of interconnected and overlapping economic, political, and socio-cultural activities:

=== Economic transnational activities ===
Economic transnational activities such as business investments in home countries and monetary [[remittances]] are both pervasive and well documented. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) estimates that in 2006 immigrants living in developed countries sent home the equivalent of $300 billion in remittances, an amount more than double the level of international aid. This intense influx of resources may mean that for some nations development prospects become inextricably linked—if not dependent upon—the economic activities of their respective [[diasporas]].

=== Political transnational activities ===
Political transnational activities can range from retained membership in political parties in one’s country of origin and voting in its elections to even running for political office. Less formal but still significant roles include the transfer or dissemination of political ideas and norms, such as publishing an op-ed in a home country newspaper, writing a blog, or lobbying a local elected official. There is also the more extreme example of individuals such as Jesus Galvis, a travel agent in New Jersey who in 1997 ran for a Senate seat in his native Colombia. He was elected and intended to hold office simultaneously in Bogota and Hackensack, New Jersey where he served as a city councilor.

=== Political economy ===
The rise of global capitalism has occurred through a novel and increasingly functional integration of capitalist chains of production and finance across borders which is tied to the formation of a transnational capitalist class.{{sfn|Robinson|2004}}{{sfn|Sklair|2000}} This approach has led to a broader study of corporate networks, the global working class{{sfn|Struna|2009}} and the transnationalization of state apparatuses and elites.{{sfn|Robinson|2012}}{{sfn|Sprague|2012}}

=== Socio-cultural transnational activities ===
Transnationalism is an analytic lens used to understand immigrant and minority populations as a meeting of multiple simultaneous histories.&lt;ref&gt;Arif Dirlik (1996) Asian on the Rim: Transnational Capital and Local Community in the Making of Contemporary Asian America. Amerasia Journal: 1996, Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Socio-cultural transnational activities cover a wide array of social and cultural transactions through which ideas and meanings are exchanged. Recent research has established the concept and importance of social remittances which provide a distinct form of social capital between migrants living abroad and those who remain at home.&lt;ref name="Levitt"/&gt; These transfers of socio-cultural meanings and practices occur either during the increased number of visits that immigrants take back to their home countries or visits made by non-migrants to friends and families living in the receiving countries or through the dramatically increased forms of correspondence such as emails, online chat sessions, telephone calls, CDs/ VDOs, and traditional letters.

In the late 1980s, [[ethnic studies]] scholars would largely move towards models of [[diaspora]] to understand immigrant communities in relation to [[area studies]], although lone patterns of international flow would become accompanied by the multiple flows of transnationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Okamura (2003) Asian American Studies in the Age of Transnationalism: Diaspora, Race, Community. Amerasia Journal: 2003, Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 171-194.&lt;/ref&gt; However, to say that immigrants build social fields that link those abroad with those back home is not to say that their lives are not firmly rooted in a particular place and time. Indeed, they are as much residents of their new community as anyone else.

Transnationalism is criticized for being too far removed from ethnic studies' efforts to empower solidarity in minority communities.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Yang Murray (2000) Oral History Research, Theory, and Asian American Studies. Amerasia Journal: 2000, Vol. 26, No. 1, pp. 105-118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Okamura (2003) Asian American Studies in the Age of Transnationalism: Diaspora, Race, Community. Amerasia Journal: 2003, Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 171-194&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asian American Studies]] provides a counterargument in that its inception was based in comparative analysis of the racial discrimination against Asian Americans and Vietnamese during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn K. Omatsu, “The ‘Four Prisons’ and the Movements of Liberation: Asian American Activism from the 1960s to the 1990s,” in Karin Aguilar-San Juan, ed., The State of Asian America: Activism and Resistance in the 1990s (Boston: South End Press, 1994), 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Migration ==

Transnationalism has significant implications for the way we conceptualize [[immigration]]. Traditionally, immigration has been seen as an autonomous process, driven by conditions such as poverty and overpopulation in the country of origin and unrelated to conditions (such as foreign policy and economic needs) in the receiving country. Even though overpopulation, [[economic stagnation]], and poverty all continue to create pressures for migration, they alone are not enough to produce large [[international migration]] flows. There are many countries, for example, which lack significant emigration history despite longstanding poverty. Also, most international immigration flows from the global South to the global North are not made up by the poorest of the poor, but, generally by professionals. In addition, there are countries with high levels of job creation that continue to witness emigration on a large scale.

The reasons and promoters for migration are not only embodied within the country of origin. Instead, they are rooted within the broader geopolitical and global dynamics. Significant evidence of geographic migration patterns suggests that receiving countries become home to immigrants from the receiving country's zone of influence. Then, immigration is but a fundamental component of the process of capitalist expansion, market penetration, and globalization. There are systematic and structural relations between globalization and immigration.

The emergence of a [[global economy]] has contributed both to the creation of potential emigrants abroad and to the formation of economic, cultural, and ideological links between industrialized and developing countries that later serve as bridges for the international migration. For example, the same set of circumstances and processes that have promoted the location of factories and offices abroad have also contributed to the creation of large supply of low-wage jobs for which immigrant workers constitute a desirable labor supply. Moreover, the decline of manufacturing jobs and the growth of the service sector, key drivers of the globalization of production, have transformed western economies’ occupational and income structure.

Unlike the manufacturing sector, which traditionally supplied middle-income jobs and competitive benefits, the majority of service jobs are either extremely well-paid or extremely poorly paid, with relatively few jobs in the middle-income range. Many of the jobs lack key benefits such as health insurance. Sales representatives, restaurant wait staff, administrative assistants, and custodial workers are among the growth occupations.

Finally, the fact that the major growth sectors rather than declining sectors are generating the most low-wage jobs shows that the supply of such jobs will continue to increase for the predictable future. The entry of migrant workers will similarly continue to meet the demand. In turn, this inflow provides the raw material out of which transnational communities emerge.

'''Wilfried Paul Feldenkirchen''' (October 25, 1947 &amp;ndash; June 21, 2010) was a [[Germans|German]] [[professor]] and [[Economy of Germany|economic]] [[historian]].

== Life ==
Wilfried Feldenkirchen was born in [[Cologne]] and studied history, [[English studies]] and economics at the [[University of Bonn]]. He was awarded a doctorate in 1974 for his thesis on ''Commerce in the City of Cologne in the 18th Century''.&lt;ref&gt;''Der Handel der Stadt Köln im 18. Jahrhundert (1700–1814).'' Bonn 1975&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, he earned a [[Habilitation]] with his thesis on ''The Iron and Steel Industry of the [[Ruhr|Ruhr District]] 1879-1914''.&lt;ref&gt;''Die Eisen- und Stahlindustrie des Ruhrgebiets 1879–1914. Wachstum, Finanzierung und Struktur ihrer Großunternehmen.'' Wiesbaden 1982, [[Spezial:ISBN Suche/3515034633|{{ISBN|3-515-03463-3}}]].&lt;/ref&gt; Feldenkirchen was awarded the [[Heinz Maier-Leibnitz-Preis]] in 1982. In 1985, he became a professor at the University of Bonn, where he was also director of the University Academic Exchange Service. He held a professorship at [[Saarland University]] in 1989/1990, and was appointed to the chair of economic, social and business history at the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]] in 1990. In the same year he published a biography of [[Werner von Siemens]] and also collaborated on the [[:de:Enzyklopädie deutscher Geschichte|Encyclopedia of German History]]. The focus of his academic work was the economic history of the 19th and 20th centuries, the history of banks and savings banks, and the history of agricultural policy. Feldenkirchen was a [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]] member (Rotary Club of [[Euskirchen|Euskirchen-Burgfey]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rotary1810.de/euskirchen_burgfey/ Homepage of the Rotary Club of Euskirchen-Burgfey] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksta.de/html/artikel/1273823443975.shtml Rotary president in fatal accident] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Feldenkirchen was killed in a car accident in [[Hinterzarten]] while test-driving a replica Siemens [[Elektrische Viktoria]], for which he was the project manager.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exchange-bhc.blogspot.com.au/2010/07/wilfried-feldenkirchen-1947-2010.html Wilfried Feldenkirchen (1947-2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.badische-zeitung.de/titisee-neustadt/feldkirchen-stirbt-bei-fahrt-mit-elektro-oldtimer--32483811.html Siemens project leader dies in test-drive of antique electric car] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suedkurier.de/region/schwarzwald-baar-heuberg/hinterzarten/Tragische-Testfahrt-Professor-stirbt-bei-Oldtimer-Unfall;art372520,4343554 Tragic test-drive: Professor dies in antique car accident] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The replica was built by a [[coachbuilder]] from Hinterzarten and had been shown by Siemens at the [[Expo 2010|Shanghai Expo 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.badische-zeitung.de/kreis-breisgau-hochschwarzwald/die-verhaengnisvolle-probefahrt-der-elektrischen-viktoria--32534050.html The fateful test-drive of the "Elektrische Viktoria"] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;
