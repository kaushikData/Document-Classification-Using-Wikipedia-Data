The ''Aalesund ship'' is an ancient vessel which was discovered embedded in the earth south of [[Aalesund, Norway]] in 1920. It is considered of a much earlier construction than either the [[Oseberg ship]] or the [[Gokstad ship]], both of which date to the ninth century. The Aalesund ship dates to the fourth century and was built during the [[iron age]].

Both the ship and a boat were discovered in the moorlands, with their pieces arranged in a peculiar manner. They had been cut prior to embedding with sections laid out in a long row from north to south. The oars had been placed straight down and were found protruding deep in the mud. The fragments of the ship were in disarray in a trench, yet seemingly arranged with some purpose conceived.

An oak rudder is well preserved and fastened beneath the middle of the ship. Six oars were recovered, two of which are fully intact, measuring 3.2 meters each. The Aalesund ship is shorter than the Oseberg ship, measuring only about twelve meters in length. Several huge stones were found in the ship's interior, leading to the conjecture that a person had been buried with the ship. Archaeologists contended that there was no validity to the idea that the ship belonged to the ancient royal chieftain [[Egill Skallagrimson]] from [[Sogn]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Viking Ship'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 22, 1920, pg. X10.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2623">'''Amhlaoibh Mór mac Fir Bhisigh''', [[Irish people|Irish]] [[poet]], [[cleric]] and [[historian]], died 1138.

==Biography==

The [[Annals of Tigernach]], ''sub anno'', give his [[obituary]]:

''1138. Amlaim Mor mac Firbisigh, ollam O Fiachrach uile re senchus &amp; re filidhecht, &amp; sái clerigh co m-bethaigthib ecailsi imda, &amp; togha do Cunga, &amp; a ec and iar m-buaidh ongtha &amp; aithrige.''

[[Nollaig Ó Muraíle]] (1996, p.&amp;nbsp;2) writes that "The terms used in the obit ... are interesting: he is described as '[[ollam]] of all Ui Fhiachrach in ''senchus'' and ''filigheacht'', as a wise cleric holding many livings and, finally, as 'the choice of [the monastic community of] [[Cong, County Mayo|Cong]].' This combination of professions of historian and poet with a clerical post of some [[wikt:eminent|eminence]] may have significance to the thorny question of the origin of the [[hereditary]] learned families of late medieval Gaelic Ireland. Apart from Amlaoimh, however ... we have little evidence of an ecclesiastical dimension to Clann Fhir Bhisigh or its antecedents before its rise to [[prominence]] in the field of traditional learning."

His [[collateral descendant]] [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]] (died 1671) recorded that he had brothers Giolla Pádraig mac Fir Bhisigh, ancestor of the Clann Fhir Bhisigh and of Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh, and possibly Lachtna, who is given as the ancestor of the Ó Lachtna / Loftus / Loughney family in Connacht.

The abbey at Cong had been refounded by King [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair|Tairrdelbach]] of [[Connacht]] (1088–1156) sometime about 1130, having become an [[episcopal see]] at the [[Synod of Ráth Breasail]] in 1111. Its canons were of the [[Augustinian]] order. It was attacked and burned in 1114, 1135 and 1137.

[[File:Saint Augustine by Philippe de Champaigne.jpg|thumb|[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine of Hippo]] wrote [[Confessions (Augustine)|''Confessions'']], the first Western autobiography ever written, around 400. Portrait by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], 17th century.]]
An '''autobiography''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]], αὐτός-''autos'' self +  βίος-''bios'' life + γράφειν-''graphein'' to write) is a self-written account of the life of oneself. The word "autobiography" was first used deprecatingly by [[William Taylor (scholar)|William Taylor]] in 1797 in the [[English language|English]] [[Periodical publication|periodical]] ''The [[Monthly Review (London)|Monthly Review]]'', when he suggested the word as a hybrid, but condemned it as "pedantic". However, its next recorded use was in its present sense, by [[Robert Southey]] in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''Autobiography''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite only being named early in the nineteenth century, first-person autobiographical writing originates in antiquity. Roy Pascal differentiates autobiography from the periodic self-reflective mode of journal or diary writing by noting that "[autobiography] is a review of a life from a particular moment in time, while the diary, however reflective it may be, moves through a series of moments in time".&lt;ref name=Pascal&gt;{{cite book|last = Pascal| first = Roy|title = Design and Truth in Autobiography|publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1960 | location = [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] | pages = | url =| doi =| id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autobiography thus takes stock of the autobiographer's life from the moment of composition. While biographers generally rely on a wide variety of documents and viewpoints, autobiography may be based entirely on the writer's memory. The [[memoir]] form is closely associated with autobiography but it tends, as Pascal claims, to focus less on the self and more on others during the autobiographer's review of his or her life.&lt;ref name=Pascal/&gt; 

''See also: [[List of autobiographies]] and [[:Category:Autobiographies]] for examples.''

== Biography ==
=== Life ===

Autobiographical works are by nature subjective. The inability—or unwillingness—of the author to accurately recall memories has in certain cases resulted in misleading or incorrect information. Some sociologists and psychologists have noted that autobiography offers the author the ability to recreate history.

=== Spiritual autobiography ===
Spiritual autobiography is an account of an author's struggle or journey towards God, followed by conversion a religious conversion, often interrupted by moments of regression. The author re-frames his or her life as a demonstration of divine intention through encounters with the Divine. The earliest example of a spiritual autobiography is Augustine's ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' though the tradition has expanded to include other religious traditions in works such as [[Zahid Rohari]]'s ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth|An Autobiography]]'' and ''[[Black Elk Speaks]]''. The spiritual autobiography works as an endorsement of his or her religion.

=== Memoirs ===
{{Main article|Memoir}}

A memoir is slightly different in character from an autobiography. While an autobiography typically focuses on the "life and times" of the writer, a memoir has a narrower, more intimate focus on his or her own memories, feelings and emotions. Memoirs have often been written by politicians or military leaders as a way to record and publish an account of their public exploits. One early example is that of [[Julius Caesar]]'s ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', also known as ''Commentaries on the Gallic Wars''. In the work, Caesar describes the battles that took place during the nine years that he spent fighting local armies in the [[Gallic Wars]]. His second memoir, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]'' (or ''Commentaries on the Civil War'') is an account of the events that took place between 49 and 48 BC in [[Caesar's civil war|the civil war]] against [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus|Gnaeus Pompeius]] and the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. 

[[Leonor López de Córdoba]] (1362–1420) wrote what is supposed to be the first autobiography in Spanish. The [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) provoked a number of examples of this genre, including works by Sir [[Edmund Ludlow]] and Sir [[Sir John Reresby, 2nd Baronet|John Reresby]]. French examples from the same period include the memoirs of [[Jean François Paul de Gondi, cardinal de Retz|Cardinal de Retz]] (1614–1679) and the [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Duc de Saint-Simon]].

=== Fictional autobiography ===
The term "fictional autobiography" signifies novels about a fictional character written as though the character were writing their own autobiography, meaning that the character is the first-person narrator and that the novel addresses both internal and external experiences of the character. [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Moll Flanders]]'' is an early example. [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' is another such classic, and [[J.D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' is a well-known modern example of fictional autobiography. [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' is yet another example of fictional autobiography, as noted on the front page of the original version. The term may also apply to works of fiction purporting to be autobiographies of real characters, e.g., [[Robert Nye]]'s ''Memoirs of [[Lord Byron]]''.

== Autobiography through the ages ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}

=== The classical period: Apologia, oration, confession ===

In antiquity such works were typically entitled ''[[wikt:apology|apologia]],'' purporting to be self-justification rather than self-documentation. [[John Henry Newman]]'s Christian confessional work (first published in 1864) is entitled ''[[Apologia Pro Vita Sua]]'' in reference to this tradition.

The Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] introduces his autobiography (''Josephi Vita'', c. 99) with self-praise, which is followed by a justification of his actions as a Jewish rebel commander of Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mason, Flavius Josephus: Translation and Commentary. Life of Josephus : translation and commentary, Volume 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Rhetoric|rhetor]] [[Libanius]] (c. 314–394) framed his life memoir (''Oration I'' begun in 374) as one of his [[Public speaking|orations]], not of a public kind, but of a literary kind that could not be aloud in privacy.

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (354–430) applied the title ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' to his autobiographical work, and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] used the same title in the 18th century,  initiating the chain of confessional and sometimes racy and highly self-critical, autobiographies of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era and beyond.  Augustine's was arguably the first Western autobiography ever written, and became an influential model for Christian writers throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. It tells of the [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyle Augustine lived for a time within his youth, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits; his following and leaving of the anti-sex and anti-marriage [[Manichaeism]] in attempts to seek sexual morality; and his subsequent return to [[Christianity]] due to his embracement of [[philosophical scepticism|Skepticism]] and the [[New Academy]] movement (developing the view that sex is good, and that virginity is better, comparing the former to silver and the latter to gold; Augustine's views subsequently strongly influenced Western theology&lt;ref&gt;Fiorenza and Galvin (1991), p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;). ''Confessions'' will always rank among the great masterpieces of western literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chadwick|first1=Henry|title=Confessions|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199537822|pages=4 (ix)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spirit of Augustine's ''Confessions'' is the 12th-century ''[[Historia Calamitatum]]'' of [[Peter Abelard]], outstanding as an autobiographical document of its period.

=== Early autobiographies ===

[[File:Baburnama.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from the ''[[Baburnama]]'']]

In the 15th century, [[Leonor López de Córdoba]], a Spanish noblewoman, wrote her ''Memorias'', which may be the first autobiography in [[Spanish language|Castillian]].

[[Babur|Zāhir ud-Dīn Mohammad Bābur]], who founded the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal dynasty]] of [[South Asia]] kept a journal ''[[Baburnama|Bāburnāma]]'' ([[Chagatai language|Chagatai]]/{{lang-fa|بابر نامہ}}; literally: ''"Book of Babur"'' or ''"Letters of Babur"'') which was written between 1493 and 1529.

One of the first great autobiographies of the [[Renaissance]] is that of the sculptor and goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] (1500–1571), written between 1556 and 1558, and entitled by him simply ''Vita'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Life''). He declares at the start: "No matter what sort he is, everyone who has to his credit what are or really seem great achievements, if he cares for truth and goodness, ought to write the story of his own life in his own hand; but no one should venture on such a splendid undertaking before he is over forty."&lt;ref&gt;Benvenuto Cellini, tr. George Bull, ''The Autobiography'', London 1966 p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria for autobiography generally persisted until recent times, and most serious autobiographies of the next three hundred years conformed to them.

Another autobiography of the period is ''De vita propria'', by the Italian mathematician, physician and astrologer [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1574).

It is often claimed that the earliest known autobiography in English is the early 15th-century ''[[The Book of Margery Kempe|Book of Margery Kempe]]'', describing among other things [[Margery Kempe|Kempe's]] pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]] and visit to [[Rome]] although it is, at best, only a partial autobiography and arguably more a memoir of religious experiences. The book remained in manuscript and was not published until 1936.

Possibly the first publicly available autobiography written in English was Captan John Smith's autobiography published in 1630 &lt;ref&gt;The True Travels, Adventures and Observations of Captain John Smith into Europe, Aisa, Africa and America from Anno Domini 1593 to 1629&lt;/ref&gt; which was regarded by many as not much more than a collection of tall tales told by someone of doubtful veracity. This changed with the publication of Philip Barbour's definitive biography in 1964 which, amongst other things, established independent factual bases for many of Smith's "tall tales", many of which could not have been known by Smith at the time of writing unless he was actually present at the events recounted. &lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Philip L (1964) The Three Worlds of Captain John Smith, Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Other notable English autobiographies of the 17th century include those of [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Lord Herbert of Cherbury]] (1643, published 1764) and [[John Bunyan]] (''[[Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners]]'', 1666).

[[Jarena Lee]] (1783 – 1864), was the first African American woman to have a published biography in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Doers_of_the_Word.html?id=jrirQL5L0xgC|title=Doers of the Word: African-American Women Speakers and Writers in the North (1830-1880)|last=Peterson|first=Carla L.|date=1998|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813525143|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
[[File:Memoirs of Franklin.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of the first English edition of [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s autobiography, 1793]]
Following the trend of [[Romanticism]], which greatly emphasized the role and the nature of the individual, and in the footsteps of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'', a more intimate form of autobiography, exploring the subject's emotions, came into fashion. [[Stendhal]]'s autobiographical writings of the 1830s, ''[[The Life of Henry Brulard]]'' and ''[[Memoirs of an Egotist]]'', are both avowedly influenced by Rousseau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Stendhal|last=Wood|first=Michael|date=1971|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0801491245|location=Ithaca, NY|page=97}}&lt;!--|access-date=July 21, 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An English example is [[William Hazlitt]]'s ''Liber Amoris'' (1823), a painful examination of the writer's love-life.

With the rise of education, cheap newspapers and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop, and the beneficiaries of this were not slow to cash in on this by producing autobiographies. It became the expectation—rather than the exception—that those in the public eye should write about themselves—not only writers such as [[Charles Dickens]] (who also incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and [[Anthony Trollope]], but also politicians (e.g. [[Henry Brooks Adams]]), philosophers (e.g. [[John Stuart Mill]]), churchmen such as [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]], and entertainers such as [[P. T. Barnum]]. Increasingly, in accordance with romantic taste, these accounts also began to deal, amongst other topics, with aspects of childhood and upbringing—far removed from the principles of "Cellinian" autobiography.
&lt;!-- work in progress—to be developed --&gt;

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
From the 17th century onwards, "scandalous memoirs" by supposed [[libertine]]s, serving a public taste for titillation, have been frequently published. Typically [[pseudonym]]ous, they were (and are) largely works of fiction written by [[ghostwriter]]s. So-called "autobiographies" of modern professional athletes and media celebrities—and to a lesser extent about politicians, generally written by a [[ghostwriter]], are routinely published. Some celebrities, such as [[Naomi Campbell]], admit to not having read their "autobiographies".{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. Some sensationalist autobiographies such as James Frey's ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'' have been publicly exposed as having embellished or fictionalized significant details of the authors' lives.

Autobiography has become an increasingly popular and widely accessible form. ''[[A Fortunate Life]]'' by [[Albert Facey]] (1979) has become an Australian literary classic.&lt;ref&gt;about-australia.com.au, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; With the critical and commercial success in the United States of such memoirs as ''[[Angela’s Ashes]]'' and ''[[The Color of Water]]'', more and more people have been encouraged to try their hand at this genre.

A genre where the "claim for truth" overlaps with fictional elements though the work still purports to be autobiographical is [[autofiction]].

Furthermore, in the latter years new impulses at the Autobiographical genre arrived from the italian poet and critic Menotti Lerro. In contrast to what Philippe Lejeune asserts Lerro claims that if the truth can only be grasped in a synchronic manner (also according to postmodernist philosophers point of view) and through fragments, why not entrust this narrative to the verse? Why not consider the role of “autobiography in verse” equally dignified as a form of self-narration? For the critic this, perhaps, is the necessary leap: through poetry it is possible to get the most dramatic and highest form of autobiographical narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Menotti Lerro, Autobiographical Poetry in England and Spain (1950-1980): Narrating Oneself in Verse (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2017), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10936">[[File:Autrigones.jpg|335px|300px|thumb|Location of the tribe of the Autrigones.]]

The '''Autrigones''' were a pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] tribe that settled in the north of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], in what today is the western [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (western regions of [[Province of Biscay|Biscay]] and [[Province of Álava|Álava]]) and northern [[Province of Burgos|Burgos]], [[Spain]]. Their territory limited with the [[Cantabri]] territory at west, the [[Caristii]] at east, the [[Berones]] at the southeast and the [[Turmodigi]] at the south. It is discussed whether the Autrigones were [[Celts]], theory supported by the existence of toponyms of Celtic origin, such as ''Uxama Barca'' and other with ''-briga'' endings&lt;ref&gt;«[http://www.enciclopedia-aragonesa.com/voz.asp?voz_id=7079 Indoeuropeización]». ''Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa OnLine''.&lt;/ref&gt; and that eventually underwent a [[Late Basquisation|Basquisation]] along with other neighboring tribes such as the [[Caristii]] and [[Varduli]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueotavira.com/Mapas/Iberia/Populi.htm Ethnic maps of Iberia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040611215344/http://www.arqueotavira.com/Mapas/Iberia/Populi.htm |date=2004-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Roman historians as [[Pomponius Mela]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] located them in the northern region of present-day [[province of Burgos]]. [[Pliny the Elder]] writes about the "ten states of the Autrigones" and says the only ones worth mentioning are ''Tritium Autrigonum'' ([[Monasterio de Rodilla]], Burgos) and ''Virovesca'' (possibly the present-day [[Briviesca]], Burgos; Celtiberian-type mint: ''Uirouiaz'')&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''The Natural History'', Book III Chap.4,3 (eds. [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]], [[Henry Thomas Riley]]) http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137&amp;query=page%3D%23167&lt;/ref&gt; in the valley of Oca River.
The other Autrigones' towns were ''Deobriga'' (near [[Miranda de Ebro]], Burgos), ''Uxama Barca'' (Osma de Valdegobia; Celtiberian-type mint: ''Uarcaz''), ''Segisamunculum'' (Cerezo del Riotirón, Burgos), ''Antecuia'' (near [[Pancorbo]], Burgos), ''Vindeleia'' ([[Cubo de Bureba]], Burgos), ''Salionca'' ([[Poza de la Sal]], Burgos) and the port of ''Portus Amanus''/''[[Flaviobriga]]'' ([[Castro Urdiales]], [[Cantabria]]).

[[File:Greek and Phoenician Colonies in The Iberian Peninsula.png|thumb|right|500px|Main language areas, peoples and tribes in Iberian Peninsula c. 300 BC., according to epigraphy and toponymy, based on the map by Luís Fraga.]]

The Autrigones are mentioned for the first time on a document by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historian [[Livy]] in 76 BC, describing the actions of [[Quintus Sertorius]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://revistas.ucm.es/ghi/11316993/articulos/CMPL9292120449A.PDF Reconstrucción paleogeográfica de autrigones, caristios y várdulos]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]] mentions them in his book ''[[Geographica]]'', naming them ''allótrigones'', a word adapted from Greek meaning "strange people".

As with their neighbors, the [[Caristii]] and the [[Varduli]], their origin is disputed.  It is yet clear if they were a Central European [[Celts|Celtic]] people that originated from the Garonne valley area in [[Gaul]] in the 5th century BC where they mingled with the [[Belgae]] and migrated to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the 4th century BC&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Naturalis Historia'', III, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''Geographikon'', III, 4, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; or an [[Aquitani]]an one.  However, based on the study of their toponyms - as also happens with the Caristii and Varduli - it is likely they were a Celtic tribe who eventually suffered a process of [[Late Basquisation|Basquisation]]. The known toponyms of the Autrigones are of Celtic origin, as ''Uxama Barca'' in present-day [[Álava]], and many others ending in ''-briga''.&lt;ref&gt;«[http://www.enciclopedia-aragonesa.com/voz.asp?voz_id=7079 Indoeuropeización]». ''Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa OnLine''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The toponyms of rivers, as the [[Nervión]], the anthroponyms, the archeological remains, tools and weapons relate them culturally with the Celts, but with a clear differentiation of other close Celtic tribes, as the [[Celtiberians]].&lt;ref&gt;«[http://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/munibe/aa/200502345364.pdf Etnogénesis del País Vasco]». Euskomedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
The Autrigones were culturally related to the early [[Iron Age]] "Monte Bernorio-[[Miraveche]]" cultural group of northern [[Province of Burgos|Burgos]] and [[Province of Palencia|Palencia]] provinces. Additional archeological evidence indicates that by the 2nd [[Iron Age]] they came under the influence of the [[Celtiberians]]. 
By the 1st century BC they were organized into a federation of autonomous mountain-top fortified towns (''[[Civitates]]'') on the mountain ranges of the upper [[Ebro]], protected by stout [[adobe]] walls of the "[[Numantia|Numantine]]" type.

More archeological evidence have been found, emphasizing their celtiberian culture, such as the hospitality ''tesserae''. These consisted on a zoomorphic-shaped metal tablet with an inscription using a variant of the [[Northeastern Iberian script]] (also known as [[Celtiberian script]]), written in a form of [[celtiberian language]].&lt;ref&gt;«[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/fichero_articulo?codigo=2689292&amp;orden=0 Nueva tésera celtibérica en la provincia de Burgos]». Universidad de La Rioja.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Around the beginning of the 4th century BC the Autrigones migrated to the Peninsula and overrun the entire area corresponding today to the modern provinces of [[Province of Cantabria|Cantabria]] and [[Province of Burgos|Burgos]], which eventually became known as ''Autrigonia'' or ''Austrigonia''.  By the mid-4th century BC the Autrigones reached the [[Pisuerga]] valley where they established their capital ''Autraca'' or ''Austraca'', located at the banks of the river ''Autra'' ([[Odra (Pisuerga)|Odra]]).  They also gained an outlet to the sea by seizing from the [[Aquitani]]-speaking [[Caristii]] further east the coastal highland region between the rivers [[Asón]] and ''Neroua'' ([[Nervión]]), in the modern eastern [[Cantabria]], [[Province of Biscay|Vizcaya]], and [[Province of Álava|Álava]] Basque provinces.  However, the Autrigones’ hold to this vast territory was not meant to last; some time after 300 BC they were driven out from southern Autrigonia – the western [[Province of Burgos|Burgos]] region – by the [[Turmodigi]] allied with the [[Vaccei]], who seized the Autrigones’ early capital Autraca.  Thrust back to their lands on the mountain ranges of the upper [[Ebro]] north of the [[Arlanzón]] valley around the 3rd-2nd Centuries BC, the Autrigones allied themselves with the [[Berones]] and evolved into a tribal society similar to the peoples of the north-west.  By the 1st century BC, they were organized into a federation of ten autonomous mountain-top fortified towns (''Civitates''), chiefly among them their new capital ''Virovesca'' in the [[Oca River|Oca]] river valley.

=== Romanization ===

They seem to have taken no part in the [[Celtiberian War]]s though as traditional allies of the [[Berones]] helped the latter in fighting off the Roman general [[Sertorius]]' incursion into northern [[Celtiberia]] in 76 BC,&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''Frag. lib.'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt; and remained independent until the late 1st century BC, when the mounting pressure of [[Astures]] and [[Cantabri]] raids finally forced them to seek an alliance with [[Roman Empire|Rome]].
Despite being aggregated in the new [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] province at the early 1st century AD, the Autrigones were only partially romanized, never became Christian and continued to provide the Roman Imperial army with auxiliary troops (''Auxilia'') up to the late Empire.  The Autrigone people survived the overthrow of the [[Roman Empire]] in Spain by the [[Germanic invasions]] of the late 4th century and briefly recreated their realm in parts of the current provinces of [[Province of Burgos|Burgos]], [[Province of Álava|Álava]], and [[Province of Biscay|Biscay]] which lasted for nearly two centuries, before being conquered by their [[Varduli]] neighbours and ultimately destroyed or absorbed by the [[Vascones]] in around AD 580.&lt;ref&gt;«[http://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/congresos/07217221.pdf Localización de algunas ciudades várdulas citadas por Mela y Ptolomeo]».

The battle was part of a campaign in spring 1837 when the liberal Army tried to chase the Carlists from the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]]. They attacked from three points: General [[Pedro Sarsfield]] from [[Pamplona]], General [[Espartero]] from [[Bilbao]] and a British-Spanish force under [[George de Lacy Evans]] from [[San Sebastián]].

On March 15 the [[British Legion (1835)|British Legion]] conquered a fortification known as Oriamendi on a strategic hill near San Sebastián.&lt;br&gt;
The next day the Carlists under [[Infante Sebastian of Portugal and Spain|Sebastian de Borbón]] counterattacked and, after a long battle, drove the British-liberal army back to their trenches outside San Sebastian. This force had suffered between 1,000 and 1,500 casualties and covering fire from the [[Royal Navy]] prevented the withdrawal from becoming a disaster. The success of the Carlist troops laid in a [[defence-in-depth]] and their infantry's high mobility.

After the battle the Carlists tightened their grip around San Sebastián, but never succeeded in taking the city.

The defeat caused an outrage at the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]]. The battle was a great boost in morale for the Carlists, and lives on in the [[Marcha de Oriamendi]], which became the anthem of the [[Carlism|Carlist movement]].

The '''Boeing NC-135''' and '''NKC-135''' are special versions of the [[Boeing C-135 Stratolifter]] and [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]] modified to operate on several different programs.

==Operational history==

===Readiness Program===

In support of the U.S. [[Test Readiness Program]] &lt;!--This is redlinked on purpose, as an article is forthcoming; please don't change--&gt; that was initiated in response to the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|Limited Test Ban Treaty]] (LTBT) of 1963, [[Sandia National Laboratories]] configured three NC-135 aircraft as flying laboratories to support atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, should testing resume. These aircraft were based at [[Kirtland Air Force Base]]. Work was initiated in 1963 and the aircraft remained in service until 1976, flying principally for Sandia, the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], and the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/recordsmgmt/exhibits/ReadinessProgram.pdf |title=Readiness Program |accessdate=2007-03-22 |last= |first= |authorlink= |format=PDF |work= |publisher=Sandia National Laboratories |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212075647/http://www.sandia.gov/recordsmgmt/exhibits/ReadinessProgram.pdf|archivedate=2006-02-12|dead-url=yes |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) maintained controlling oversight of the NC-135 flight test aircraft. After 1976, the aircraft flew for [[Air Force Research Laboratory|Air Force Weapons Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="inflight"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/getfile?00285812.pdf |title=In Flight: The Story of Los Alamos Eclipse Missions |accessdate=2007-03-22 |last=Mulkin |first=Barb |authorlink= |format=PDF |work=[[Los Alamos Science]] |publisher=Los Alamos National Laboriatories |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boeing NKC-135 "Big Crow" nose.JPEG|thumb|A USAF NKC-135 "Big Crow" with oversized nose at a forward deployed operating base]]

While flying simulations for the Test Readiness Program, the science teams assigned to the NC-135 aircraft realized that their flying laboratories could be effectively used to study [[solar eclipse]]s as well as [[cosmic ray]]s entering the atmosphere and the effects of magnetic fields in the [[ionosphere]]. Program scientists petitioned the AEC to allow for a program-within-a-program to use the aircraft for such scientific research. The petition was approved, and research continued through 1975.&lt;ref name="inflight"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sofia.usra.edu/Edu/docs/97-Whiting_AeroHistory.pdf |title=Milestones in Airbornce Astronomy: From the 1920s to the Present |accessdate=2007-03-22 |last=Dolci |first=Wendy |authorlink= |year=1997 |format=PDF |work= |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050330100204/http://www.sofia.usra.edu/Edu/docs/97-Whiting_AeroHistory.pdf|archivedate=2005-03-30|dead-url=yes |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first eclipse mission took place from [[Pago Pago International Airport]] in 1965.  Flying in conjunction with several other science aircraft, one of the NC-135s managed to fly within eclipse totality for 160 seconds, providing valuable science data. Eclipse missions were also flown in 1970, 1972, 1973, 1979 and 1980.&lt;ref name="inflight"/&gt;

===Big Crow===
''Big Crow'' is the designation of the two NKC-135 test-bed aircraft (55-3132 and 63-8050) heavily modified for electronic warfare testing.  These planes were also used as a target simulator for flight testing the [[Boeing YAL-1]] Airborne Laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/descriptivesum/Y2008/MDA/0603883C.pdf |title=RDT&amp;E, DW/04 Advanced Component Development and Prototypes |accessdate=2007-03-22 |last= |first= |authorlink= |date=February 2007  |format=PDF |work=Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Exhibit R-2 RDT&amp;E Budget Item Justification |publisher=Missile Defense Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 15, 2007, the YAL-1 successfully fired this laser in flight, hitting its target. The target was the NKC-135E ''Big Crow 1'' test aircraft that had been specially modified with a "signboard" target on its fuselage. The test validated the system's ability to track an airborne target and measure and compensate for atmospheric distortion.&lt;ref name="atn1"&gt;Grill, Eric M., "Airborne Laser fires tracking laser, hits target", ''Aerotech News and Review'', March 23, 2007, vol 22 issue 8&lt;/ref&gt;

''Big Crow'' aircraft are also used as downrange telemetry assets in conjunction with [[Western Launch and Test Range]] launches from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/delta/d335/080812delay.html |title=Delta 2 rocket launch of GeoEye craft postponed |author=Ray, Justin |publisher=Spaceflight Now |date=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, 55-3132 and 63-8050 have been retired, and relegated to the [[309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group|AMARG]] (Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, AZ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HNL RareBirds|url=http://hnlrarebirds.blogspot.com/2011/03/us-air-forces-55-3132.html|website=hnlrarebirds.blogspot.com|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NKC135B &amp; E 63-8050 / 55-3132 USAF|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanair/6197200453|website=www.flickr.com|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other versions===

One aircraft, serial 61-2666, has been modified as an NC-135W to test systems and equipment used on RC-135V and W Rivet Joint reconnaissance aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;DoD 4120.15L ''Model Designations of Military Aerospace Vehicles''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/412015-L(addendum).html|title=DOD 4120.15-L – Addendum|work=designation-systems.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1975 to 1984, the US used an NKC-135 for its [[Airborne Laser]] Lab program. The modified NKC-135A carried 10.6 micrometer Carbon Dioxide Laser. Tests included successful interceptions of small [[air-to-air missile]]s (such as the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]]) and of [[drone aircraft]]. Despite the combat potential of the system, it was kept strictly experimental. However, the [[SCUD]] threat faced during the [[Gulf War]] reignited interest in an airborne laser system, resulting in the [[Boeing YAL-1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/all.htm|title=Airborne Laser Laboratory|author=John Pike|work=globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausairpower.net/AADR-HEL-Dec-81.html] ''HIGH ENERGY LASER WEAPONS''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bošnjani''''' (singular: ''Bošnjanin''; {{Lang-la|Bosniensis}}), meaning ''Bosnians'', is the archaic name for inhabitants of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. The demonym appears in Bosnian state documents (''povelje'') since the 14th century, as used for the people of [[medieval Bosnia]] until the last Bosnian king [[Stjepan Tomašević]] prior to the [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia]]. 

Appearing in a number of documents from the period, it was in most cases coupled with the word Good (''"Dobri"''). For example, a 1417 document by [[Stjepan Ostoja]] mentions ''i nostri boni Bosnensi'', and the same term is used in a 1419 document by [[Stjepan Ostojić]].&lt;ref name="Ćošković-1996"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=115165&amp;lang=en | language = Croatian | author = [[Pejo Ćošković]] | title = Veliki knez bosanski Tvrtko Borovinić | journal = Croatica Christiana Periodica | volume = 20 | number = 37 |date=June 1996 | issn = 0350-7823 | pages = 63–64 | quote = [...] svjedoci [...] označeni izrazima "naši dobri Bošnjani (i nostri boni Bosnensi), što sasvim jasno određuje njihovu stalešku pripadnost bosanskom plemstvu.25 - Navedeni izrazi ne predstavljaju nikakvu konfesionalnu odrednicu onih na koje se odnosi, kako se to može napose u historiografskoj literaturi o »Crkvi bosanskoj«, pa s tim u vezi navodimo tek djela nekih istaknutijih autora. Usp. F. ŠIŠIĆ, ''Vojvoda Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić i njegovo doba (1350–1414)'', Zagreb, 1902, 236 (dalje: ŠIŠIĆ, ''Vojvoda Hrvoje''); D.

Uvažavanje te složenosti bosanskog državnog prostora može pružiti podlogu i pomoći pri razmišljanju o etničkoj i narodnosnoj pripadnosti srednjovjekovnog bosanskog stanovništva. U tijesnoj vezi s tim je postanak i funkcioniranje naziva ''Bošnjani'' kojim su u domaćoj izvornoj građi nazivani politički podanici bosanskih vladara od vremena Stjepana II. Kotromanića. Rjeđe su taj naziv Dubrovčani talijanizirali i pisali kao ''Bosignani''. | accessdate = 15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosnian historian Pejo Ćošković, citing [[Ferdo Šišić]] and [[Dominik Mandić]], describes the use of the term in royal documents as membership in Bosnian nobility, with no indication of the subject's religion,&lt;ref name="Ćošković-1996"/&gt; and as a political term to distinguish people from Bosnia proper from people from other lands of the Kingdom of Bosnia.&lt;ref name="Ćošković-2000"/&gt; 

During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era the preferred term for an inhabitant of Bosnia came to be ''[[Bošnjak (disambiguation)|Bošnjak]]'', with the suffix ''"-iak"'' replacing the traditional ''"-anin"''. The English term [[Bosniak]] is in turn a translation of that term. During the Austro-Hungarian era the term Bošnjak was also preferred until the beginning of the 20th century. The situation changed again in the 20th century, as ''[[Bosanac (disambiguation)|Bosanac]]'' (see also [[Bosnian (disambiguation)|Bosnian]] and [[Bosnians]]) came to be the preferred term. Following the independence of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in the early 1990s, Bosniaks re-established the (by then) archaic term ''Bošnjaci'' - [[Bosniaks]] - for their nation based on the word's historical ethno-geographic connotations, the term not having been recognized in the [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[censuses]] before that.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3929">In [[intellectual history]] and the [[history of political thought]], the '''Cambridge School''' is a loose historiographical movement traditionally associated with the [[University of Cambridge]], where many of those associated with the School held or continue to hold academic positions, including [[Quentin Skinner]], [[J. G. A. Pocock]], [[Peter Laslett]], [[John Dunn (political theorist)|John Dunn]] and [[James Tully (philosopher)|James Tully]], as well as [[David Runciman]] and [[Raymond Geuss]].

==Overview==
The Cambridge School can broadly be characterised as a [[historicism|historicist]] or [[contextualism|contextualist]] mode of interpretation, placing primary emphasis on the historical conditions and the intellectual context of the [[discourse]] of a given historical era, and opposing the perceived [[anachronism]] of conventional methods of interpretation, which it believes often distort the significance of texts and ideas by reading them in terms of distinctively modern understandings of social and political life. In these terms, the Cambridge School is 'idealist' in the sense that it accepts ideas as constitutive elements of human history in themselves, and hence contradicts social-scientific [[positivism]] in historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vanheste|first=Jeroen|authorlink= |title=Guardians of the Humanist Legacy: The Classicism of T.S. Eliot's Criterion Network and Its Relevance to Our Postmodern World|url= |accessdate= |year=2007|publisher=Koninklijke Brill|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|isbn= |pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text often held as the original declaration of the principles of the School&lt;ref name="blackledge"&gt;{{cite book |last=Blackledge|first=Peter|authorlink= |title=Reflections on the Marxist Theory of History|url= |accessdate= |year=2006|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK|isbn= |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is Quentin Skinner's 1969 article 'Meaning and Understanding in the History of Ideas'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Skinner|first1=Quentin|year=1969|title=Meaning and Understanding in the History of Ideas|journal=History and Theory|volume=8|issue=1|pages=3–53|doi=10.2307/2504188|jstor=2504188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Skinner attacks what he describes as two "orthodoxies": "perennialism", the view that philosophers have always debated the same fundamental questions; and the notion that context is irrelevant to a historical understanding of texts, which can be read as self-standing material.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mark Bevir]]'s words, Skinner and his colleagues "defended the history of political theory against both reductionists who dismissed ideas as mere epiphenomena and canonical theorists who approached texts as timeless philosophical works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bevir|first=Mark|editor1-last=Klosko|editor1-first=George|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Political Philosophy|chapter=Chapter 1. The Contextual Approach|page=14|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school has been criticised on a number of fronts. On the one hand, historians working in more materialist contexts such as [[social history]] have criticised the school's focus on ideas.&lt;ref name="blackledge" /&gt; Christopher Goto-Jones has argued that the school has developed in an [[orientalism|orientalist]] direction by neglecting non-Western contributions to intellectual history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Goto-Jones |first=Christopher |title=Re-politicising the Kyoto School as Philosophy |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Coagh ambush''' was a military confrontation that took place took place in [[Northern Ireland|Ulster]] on 3 June 1991, during [[The Troubles]], when a [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) [[active service unit|unit]] from its [[East Tyrone Brigade]] was ambushed by the British Army's [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) at the village of [[Coagh]], in [[County Tyrone]], whilst on its way to kill a part-time member of the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR). The ambush resulted in the deaths of all three IRA men involved.

==Background==
In May 1987, an eight-man unit of the [[Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade]] was [[Loughgall ambush|ambushed and shot dead]] by a Special Air Service (SAS) during an attack by them on a [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) rural police station at the village of [[Loughgall]], [[County Armagh]]. This was the IRA's greatest loss of life in a single incident during [[Provisional Irish Republican Army campaign 1969–1997|its campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Raymond (1990). ''The SAS in Ireland''. Mercier Press, p. 380; {{ISBN|0-85342-938-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this major setback, IRA activity in East Tyrone didn't lessen in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, Mark (1992). ''Big Boys' Rules''. Faber and Faber, p. 242; {{ISBN|0-571-16112-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1988, the British Army shot dead another three IRA men who were stalking a part-time Ulster Defence Regiment soldier whilst he was off-duty near [[Carrickmore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/irish_news/arts2003/sep12_DUP_protest_IRA_commemoration.php DUP slams GAA club IRA commemoration], Newshound.com, 27 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; British intelligence sources claimed the men were involved in the [[Ballygawley bus bombing]], which killed eight British soldiers and injured 28,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Land Mine Kills 7 British Soldiers on Bus in Ulster|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/21/world/ira-claims-killing-of-8-soldiers-as-it-steps-up-attacks-on-british.html|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=20 August 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|title=IRA Claims Killing of 8 Soldiers As It Steps Up Attacks on British|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/21/world/ira-claims-killing-of-8-soldiers-as-it-steps-up-attacks-on-british.html|accessdate=9 December 2010|first=Steve|last=Lohr|date=21 August 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the British Army changing its troop transportation methods in East Tyrone, switching from using unarmoured vehicular transport coaches on country roads, to ferrying them in and out of its bases in the district using helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;Bijl, Nick van der (2009).

===Tit-for-tat killings in East Tyrone===
The series of killings which led to the Coagh ambush began on 26 April 1988, when a 23-year-old UDR soldier from Coagh, Edward Gibson, was shot dead by an IRA unit at [[Ardboe]] whilst at work for [[Cookstown]] Council on a bin lorry.&lt;ref&gt;Toolis, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Off-duty UDR soldiers, who tended to be Protestants, were common targets of the IRA in County Tyrone. These attacks fostered a perception among some Protestants that the IRA was waging a sectarian war against them.&lt;ref&gt;Toolis, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) retaliated by murdering Phelim McNally (brother of local Sinn Féin councillor Francie McNally) on 24 November  1988.&lt;ref&gt;Toolis, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by an IRA attack upon a car maintenance garage business owned by a retired UDR soldier called Leslie Dallas on 7 March 1989, in which Dallas, along with two civilian pensioners that were attending the premises at the time of the attack, were all killed. The IRA, announcing responsibility for the attack afterwards stated that Dallas was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force.&lt;!--so far I only see IRA claims regarding this unconfirmed claim--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKittrick, pp. 1164–65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moloney|first=Ed|authorlink=Ed Moloney|title=A Secret History of the IRA|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|year=2002|isbn=0-14-101041-X|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palacebarracksmemorialgarden.co.uk/roll.html Palace Barracks Memorial Garden]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tit-for-tat]] campaign around Coagh continued on 29 November 1989, when UVF gunmen attacked a [[public house|pub]] owned by IRA member Liam Ryan, shooting Ryan dead, a customer in the premises was also killed in the incident.&lt;ref name="Toolis, p. 66"&gt;Toolis, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 March 1990, a part-time UDR soldier and construction worker Thomas Jamison was killed by the IRA in a gun and grenade ambush attack on a lorry he was driving near [[Donaghmore, County Tyrone|Donaghmore]] whilst delivering concrete to a British Army base.&lt;ref&gt;[[David McKittrick|McKittrick, David]] (1999). ''Lost lives''. Mainstream, p. 1193; {{ISBN|1-84018-227-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toolis, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Jamison was an employee of 'Henry Brothers', a building firm that had a contract with the British Government for constructing police and armed forces' instillations. Harold Henry, one of the two brothers who owned the company, had been murdered by the IRA in 1987 in [[The Loup]], [[County Londonderry]].&lt;ref&gt;Toolis, pp. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 1991 the Ulster Volunteer Force carried out an attack at the village of [[Cappagh, County Tyrone|Cappagh]], in the [[1991 Cappagh killings|attack]], killing three IRA members. The IRA subsequently stated that in its view this attack could have been carried out only with the connivance of the British state forces.&lt;ref&gt;Toolis, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 9 April 1991 the IRA's East Tyrone Brigade shot dead Derek Ferguson in [[Coagh]] (a cousin of local Member of Parliament Reverend [[William McCrea (politician)|William McCrea]]), stating afterward that he was a paramilitary with the Ulster Volunteer Force. Ferguson's family subsequently refuted that he had anything to do with Loyalist paramilitarism&lt;ref name=glen/&gt;

The historian Kevin Toolis includes as part of this cycle of violence the [[Glenanne barracks bombing|destruction of Glenanne UDR barracks]] in nearby [[County Armagh]], in which three soldiers were killed and 10 injured by an IRA truck bomb on 30 May.&lt;ref name=glen&gt;Toolis, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The IRA later claimed the killings of 3 of its members that followed in Coagh was a retaliation by the British Army for the Glenanne bombing.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;Summers, Chris (2009).

==The ambush==
[[Image:Cav DSCF0370.JPG|thumb|200px|A red Vauxhall Cavalier like that driven by the IRA men at the time of the ambush]]
At 7.30 am on 3 June 1991, three Tyrone IRA paramilitaries – Tony Doris (21 years old), Michael "Pete" Ryan (37) (on the run at the time from the Royal Ulster Constabulary since 1981 after escaping from imprisonment in Belfast for terrorist related offences) and Lawrence McNally (39) – drove a stolen [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] from [[Moneymore|Moneymore, County Londonderry]] to the village of Coagh,&lt;ref name=in&gt;Burrell, Ian [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/army-goes-to-war-over-sas-mans-revelations-1244144.html "Army goes to war over SAS man's revelations"], [[The Independent]], 7 August 1997; accessed 4 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; crossing the border of counties Londonderry and Tyrone, to kill a part-time Ulster Defence Regiment soldier, who was in his civilian life a contractor that worked with the security forces.&lt;ref name="glen"&gt;Toolis, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Their intent, however, was known to the British security forces, having been revealed by either a Crown [[espionage|agent]] within the IRA itself,&lt;ref name="glen"/&gt; or from covert technical surveillance.&lt;ref name=pet&gt;Taylor, Peter, (2001). ''Brits: the war against the IRA''. Bloomsbury Publishing, p. 305; {{ISBN|0-7475-5806-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence a detachment from the British Army's [[Special Air Service]] was laying in wait for Doris, Ryan and McNally on both sides of Coagh's main street,&lt;ref&gt;Toolis, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; and also in a red [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]] lorry at the scene.&lt;ref name=in/&gt; 

The stolen car was driven by Doris towards the center of the village,&lt;ref name=shot&gt;Toolis, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; its journey from Moneymore being tracked on the ground and in the air. At the scene of the ambush the British Army had set up a "decoy" target for the IRA to go for in the form of an SAS trooper who was pretending to be their intended victim, sitting in his car at a regular spot while waiting to pick up a friend on their way to work, which IRA intelligence had established the behavioral pattern of.&lt;ref name=pet/&gt; When the stolen car carrying the IRA men approached the scene the Special Air Service detachment opened sustained automatic fire upon it from close range. Doris was immediately hit, and the out-of-control car crashed into two nearby parked cars.&lt;ref name=shot/&gt; The shooting continued until the car exploded in flames and set one of the parked vehicles it had crashed into alight.&lt;ref name=lib&gt;MacThomáis, Shane (2005).

[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1991/jun/04/northernireland.owenbowcott "Unionists approve hardline as army shoots IRA team"], guardian.co.uk, 4 June 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Some reports claim at least two of the IRA men attempted to exit the crashed car &lt;ref&gt;Pogatchnik, Shawn (1991). [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-04/news/mn-179_1_northern-ireland "3 IRA Guerrillas in Hijacked Car Slain by British"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 4 June 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and were subsequently found lying half out of its doors by the later police investigation of the scene.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Relatives of the IRA men subsequently stated that they had received information from the scene that two of the IRA attackers had fled on foot from the car after the crash, but had been pursued after and shot down by the British Army in the vicinity, with their bodies being taken back to the car, which was subsequently reported to be riddled with over 200 bullet holes. A Royal Ulster Constabulary crime-scene report stated that a [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]] belonging to one of the IRA men was found some distance away from the vehicle.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; 

The bodies of the Doris, Ryan and McNally were badly burnt by the car fire, and had to be identified by the police using their dental records.&lt;ref name=shot/&gt; Two rifles were recovered from within the burnt-out stolen car, subsequent police forensic examination of them revealing that they had both been used in the multiple murders at Leslie Dallas's garage (see above) in March 1989.&lt;ref name="Toolis, p. 66"/&gt;

==Subsequent events==
Local [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) politician [[William McCrea (politician)|William McCrea]] – cousin of Derek Ferguson, killed by the IRA on 9 April – declared that "(the IRA men involved) had fallen into the pit they planned for others.... Justice has now been done".&lt;ref name=pet/&gt; [[Ian Paisley]], leader of the DUP, welcomed the ambush and said "The time has come for a full war".&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; [[Sinn Féin]] councillor Francie McNally – brother of Lawrence McNally – said the three men were "good soldiers ... executed by the British Crown forces". Sinn Fein criticised both the Royal Ulster Constabulary and [[Gardaí]] for "delaying and harassing" the subsequent funerals of the three men, whose bodies were buried with IRA ceremony. Sinn Fein publicly denied Royal Ulster Constabulary statements that the unit Doris, Ryan and McNally were a part of was engaged in an ethnic-sectarian campaign targeting Protestant workmen.&lt;ref name=lib/&gt; [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] MP [[Seamus Mallon]] warned that an "ethic of violence is eating into the soul of this community"&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/74687973.html?dids=74687973:74687973&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+04%2C+1991&amp;author=Glenn+Frankel&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=British+Commando+Squad+Kills+3+IRA+Gunmen+in+Ambush&amp;pqatl=google British Commando Squad Kills 3 IRA Gunmen in Ambush] by Glenn Frankel, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 4 June 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and that he "hoped that every effort at arrest had been made".&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

{{globalize|date=December 2010}}
The '''crime against nature''' or '''unnatural act''' has historically been a legal term in [[English language|English]]-speaking [[State (polity)|states]] identifying forms of [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]] not considered [[natural]] or decent and are legally punishable [[offence (law)|offenses]].&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone (1753), [[Commentaries on the Laws of England]], Book 4, Chapter 15, Section 4&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual practices that have historically been considered to be "crimes against nature" include [[anal sex]]&lt;ref name="See Rose v 1975"&gt;See Rose v. Locke, 1975, 96 S.Ct. 243, 423 U.S. 48, 46 L.Ed.2d 185.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref name="Andrews v. Vanduzer 1814"&gt;Andrews v. Vanduzer, [[Supreme Court of New York|N.Y.Sup.]] 1814 (January Term, 1814)(Vanduzer accused Andrews of having had connection with a cow and then a mare and the court understood this to mean that Vanduzer was going around telling others that Andrews had been guilty of the crime against nature with a beast.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and terminology==

For much of modern history, a "crime against nature" was understood by courts to be synonymous to "[[buggery]]", and to include [[anal sex]] (copulation ''per anum'') and [[zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref name="See Rose v 1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrews v. Vanduzer 1814"/&gt; Early court decisions agreed that [[fellatio]] (copulation ''per os'') was not included, though mainly because that practice was virtually unknown when the common-law definition was established (it remained so rare that first attempted fellatio prosecutions under the "crime against nature" statute date to 1817 in England and 1893 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rex v. Samuel Jacobs (1817); Prindle v. State of Texas, 21 S.W. 360 (1893)&lt;/ref&gt;) Likewise, sexual activities between two women were not covered. Over time, particularly starting in the early 20th century, some jurisdictions started enacting statutes or developing precedents the extended the scope of the crime to include fellatio and, sometimes, other sexual activities.

The term ''crime against nature'' is closely related to, and was often used interchangeably with, the term ''[[sodomy]]''. (This varied from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Sometimes the two terms were understood to be synonymous; sometimes sodomy was limited to sexual activities between two humans;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outhistory.org/oldwiki/images/8/81/Ausman_v._Veal,_10_IN_355.pdf|title=Ausman v. Veal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes sodomy was taken to include anal sex or bestiality, whereas ''crime against nature'' also included fellatio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4736&amp;context=jclc|title=The role of common law concepts in modern jurisprudence}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Until the early 19th century, courts were divided on whether the act needed to be completed (to result in ejaculation) in order to be a punishable offense. This question was deemed sufficiently important that, in 1828, English law was explicitly amended to specify that proof of ejaculation was not necessary for convictions for buggery and rape.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American and English Encyclopedia of Law|author= Charles F. Williams|year=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crime was not limited to same-sex activities, and, in case of an act between two adults, both participants were guilty, regardless of consent. Attempted or completed act of sodomy, committed by a husband against his wife, was grounds for divorce in common law.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;

Historically, the offense was usually referred to by its longer name, the ''detestable and abominable'' (or ''abominable and detestable'', or, sometimes, ''infamous'') ''crime against nature, committed with mankind or beast''. This phrase originates in [[Buggery Act 1533]], with words "crime against nature" substituted for "vice of buggery" in the original, and it was present in one of these forms in criminal codes of most U.S. states.  Specific acts included under this heading were typically deemed too detestable to list them explicitly, resulting in a number of vagueness-based legal challenges to corresponding statutes. One of the most recent, and one of the rare successful challenges, is the 1971 Florida case of ''[[Franklin v. State]]''. On the other hand, just 7 years prior, a similar challenge (''Perkins v. State''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/234/333/1671292/|title=Perkins v. State of North Carolina, 234 F. Supp. 333 (W.D.N.C. 1964)}}&lt;/ref&gt;) failed in North Carolina. (In ''Perkins'', the Court wrote that, if this were a new statute, it would have been "obviously unconstitutional for vagueness", but, since this was a statute whose history was traceable back to the reign of [[Henry VIII]], it accumulated a number of judicial interpretations, and, backed with these interpretations, it was not unconstitutionally vague.)

Penalties for this offense varied greatly over time and between jurisdictions. Crime against nature remained punishable by death or life imprisonment both in the UK and in many U.S. states well into the 19th century. Liberalization of sexual morals led to reduction of penalties or decriminalization of the offense during the second half of the 20th century, so that, by 2003, it was no longer a punishable offense in 36 out of 50 U.S. states, and was only punishable by a fine in some of the remaining 14. (See [[Sodomy laws in the United States]] for details.)

==Current use==
Currently, the term crime against nature is still used in the [[statutes]] of the following [[United States|American]] states. However, these laws are unconstitutional to enforce for sexual conduct between consenting adults in light of ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003). The crime against nature statutes are however still used to criminalize sexual conduct involving minors, [[incest]], public sex, [[prostitution]] and [[bestiality]].

==Repeal and unconstitutionality==
Except for the above nine states, all other states in the United States have repealed their "crimes against nature" laws. Furthermore, in 2003, in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', the US Supreme Court held that nonremunerative sex between consenting adults in private was protected by the Constitution and could not be criminalized under "crimes against nature" laws. Thus, fellatio, cunnilingus and homosexual sex can no longer fall within the scope of such laws.

'''Criticisms of [[postmodernism]]''' while intellectually diverse, share the opinion that it lacks coherence and is hostile to the notion of absolutes, such as truth. Specifically it is held that postmodernism can be meaningless, promotes [[obscurantism]] and uses [[relativism]] (in culture, morality, knowledge) to the extent that it cripples most judgement calls. 

Post modernity is a broad umbrella term for highly diverse intellectual and artistic activity and two postmoderisms (for example [[Postmodern literature|post modern literature]] and [[Postmodern philosophy|post modern philosophy]]) can have little in common. Criticism of postmodernism in general is usually not a comprehensive attack on the various diverse movements labelled postmodern. Such criticism often refers to specific branches of postmodernism, frequently on intellectual theories in the humanities (philosophy, history, gender and LGBT+ studies, structuralism, [[cultural relativism]] and "theory"). [[Postmodern philosophy]] is also a frequent subject of criticism frequently for obscurantism and resistance to reliable knowledge. For example, a philosopher may criticize French postmodern philosophy but have no problem with postmodern cinema. Conversely philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] criticized postmodern humanities and some elements of postmodern art yet never broadly attacking the entire inventory of varied postmodern projects. One of the very criticisms of postmodernism, as a whole, is the absence of a definition of what postmodernism in itself is and even what specific post-modern anything is.

==Vagueness==
Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] has argued that postmodernism is meaningless because it adds nothing to analytical or empirical knowledge. He asks why postmodernist intellectuals won't respond like people in other fields when asked:

{{quote|Seriously, what are the principles of their theories, on what evidence are they based, what do they explain that wasn't already obvious, etc? These are fair requests for anyone to make. If they can't be met, then I'd suggest recourse to [[David Hume|Hume's]] advice in similar circumstances: to the flames.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bactra.org/chomsky-on-postmodernism.html Noam Chomsky on Post-Modernism]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Christopher Hitchens]] in his book, ''Why Orwell Matters'', writes, in advocating for simple, clear and direct expression of ideas, "The Postmodernists' tyranny wears people down by boredom and semi-literate prose."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hitchens. Why Orwell matters, Basic Books. {{ISBN|978-0465030507}}, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens also criticized a postmodernist volume, "The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism":&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hitchens. Transgressing the Boundaries. NY Times, May 22, 2005. https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/22/books/review/transgressing-the-boundaries.html&lt;/ref&gt; "The French, as it happens, once evolved an expression for this sort of prose: la langue de bois, the wooden tongue, in which nothing useful or enlightening can be said, but in which various excuses for the arbitrary and the dishonest can be offered. (This book) is a pointer to the abysmal state of mind that prevails in so many of our universities."

In a similar vein, [[Richard Dawkins]] writes in a favorable review of [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]]'s ''[[Fashionable Nonsense|Intellectual Impostures]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins (1998/2007). [https://web.archive.org/web/20140121203722/http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/824-postmodernism-disrobed Postmodernism disrobed]. Retrieved 28 February 2016. Originally published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] '''394''':141–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Suppose you are an intellectual impostor with nothing to say, but with strong ambitions to succeed in academic life, collect a coterie of reverent disciples and have students around the world anoint your pages with respectful yellow highlighter. What kind of literary style would you cultivate? Not a lucid one, surely, for clarity would expose your lack of content.}}

Dawkins then uses the following quotation from [[Félix Guattari]] as an example of this "lack of content" and of clarity.

{{quote|We can clearly see that there is no bi-univocal correspondence between linear signifying links or archi-writing, depending on the author, and this multireferential, multi-dimensional machinic catalysis. The symmetry of scale, the transversality, the pathic non-discursive character of their expansion: all these dimensions remove us from the logic of the excluded middle and reinforce us in our dismissal of the ontological binarism we criticised previously.}}

It has been suggested that the term "postmodernism" is a mere [[buzzword]] that means nothing. For example, Dick Hebdige, in ''Hiding in the Light'', writes:

{{quote|When it becomes possible for a people to describe as 'postmodern' the décor of a room, the design of a building, the [[diegesis]] of a film, the construction of a record, or a [[Scratch video|'scratch' video]], a television commercial, or an arts documentary, or the 'intertextual' relations between them, the layout of a page in a fashion magazine or critical journal, an anti-teleological tendency within epistemology, the attack on the 'metaphysics of presence', a general attenuation of feeling, the collective chagrin and morbid projections of a post-War generation of baby boomers confronting disillusioned middle-age, the 'predicament' of reflexivity, a group of rhetorical tropes, a proliferation of surfaces, a new phase in [[commodity fetishism]], a fascination for images, codes and styles, a process of cultural, political or existential fragmentation and/or crisis, the 'de-centring' of the subject, an 'incredulity towards metanarratives', the replacement of unitary power axes by a plurality of power/discourse formations, the 'implosion of meaning', the collapse of cultural hierarchies, the dread engendered by the threat of nuclear self-destruction, the decline of the university, the functioning and effects of the new miniaturised technologies, broad societal and economic shifts into a 'media', 'consumer' or 'multinational' phase, a sense (depending on who you read) of 'placelessness' or the abandonment of placelessness ('critical regionalism') or (even) a generalised substitution of spatial for temporal coordinates – when it becomes possible to describe all these things as 'Postmodern' (or more simply using a current abbreviation as 'post' or 'very post') then it's clear we are in the presence of a buzzword.&lt;ref name="Hebdige:410"&gt;Dick Hebdige, ’Postmodernism and "the other side"’, in ''Cultural Theory and Popular Culture: A reader'', edited by John Storey, London, Pearson Education, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Postmodernists or postmodern-friendly intellectuals such as the British historian [[Perry Anderson]] defend the existence of the varied meanings assigned to the term "postmodernism", claiming they only contradict one another on the surface and that a postmodernist analysis can offer insight into contemporary culture.&lt;ref&gt;Perry Anderson, in "The Origins of Postmodernity", London: Verso, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaya Yılmaz defends the lack of clarity and consistency in the term's definition. Yılmaz points out that because the theory itself is "anti-essentialist and anti-foundationalist" it is fitting that the term cannot have any essential or fundamental meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Yılmaz, K 2010, "Postmodernism and its Challenge to the Discipline of History: Implications for History Education", ''Educational Philosophy &amp; Theory'', 42:7, pp. 779–795, Academic Search Premier, EBSCOhost, viewed 15 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Sokal has critiqued similar defenses of postmodernism by noting that replies like this only demonstrate the original point that postmodernist critics are making: that a clear and meaningful answer is always missing and wanting.

==Moral relativism==
Some critics, such as [[Noam Chomsky]], have interpreted postmodern society to be synonymous with [[moral relativism]] and contributing to [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.probe.org/radio-program/truth-decay.html# |title="Truth Decay", Probe Ministries |access-date=2009-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610121241/http://www.probe.org/radio-program/truth-decay.html# |archive-date=2008-06-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wells, David F. [http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9901/reviews/charles.html Review]:"Losing Our Virtue: Why the Church Must Recover Its Moral Vision," 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (June 10, 2009) [https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:FrKYAo88ckkJ:www.materdei.ie/media/conferences/a-secular-age-parallel-sessions-timetable.pdf+%22Stan+Seidner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us "A Trojan Horse: Logotherapeutic Transcendence and its Secular Implications for Theology"]. ''Mater Dei Institute''.{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culturally conservative writers, such as [[Charles Colson]], are characterized as tending to look askance at the postmodernist era as ideologically agnostic and replete with moral relativism or situation ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (June 10, 2009) [https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:FrKYAo88ckkJ:www.materdei.ie/media/conferences/a-secular-age-parallel-sessions-timetable.pdf+%22Stan+Seidner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us "A Trojan Horse: Logotherapeutic Transcendence and its Secular Implications for Theology"]. ''Mater Dei Institute''. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josh McDowell]] and Bob Hostetler offer the following definition of postmodernism: "A worldview characterized by the belief that truth doesn't exist in any objective sense but is created rather than discovered. ... [Truth is] created by the specific culture and exists only in that culture.  Therefore, any system or statement that tries to communicate truth is a power play, an effort to dominate other cultures."&lt;ref&gt;Josh McDowell &amp; Bob Hostetler, ''The New Tolerance'' (Carol Stream IL: Tyndale House, 1998), p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many philosophical movements reject both modernity and postmodernity as healthy states of being. Some of these are associated with cultural and religious [[conservatism]] that views postmodernity as a rejection of basic spiritual or natural truths and in its emphasis on material and physical pleasure an explicit rejection of inner balance and spirituality. Many of these critiques attack specifically the tendency to the "abandonment of objective truth" as the crucial unacceptable feature of the postmodern condition&lt;ref&gt;See for an example the [[Traditionalist School]], in special the critical works by [[René Guénon]].&lt;/ref&gt; and often aim to offer a meta-narrative that provides this truth.

==Marxian criticisms==
[[Alex Callinicos]] attacks notable postmodern thinkers such as [[Baudrillard]] and [[Lyotard]], arguing postmodernism "reflects the disappointed [[revolutionary]] generation of 1968, (particularly those of May 1968 in France) and the incorporation of many of its members into the professional and managerial 'new middle class'. It is best read as a symptom of political frustration and [[social mobility]] rather than as a significant intellectual or cultural phenomenon in its own right."&lt;ref&gt;Alex Callinicos, [http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745606149 Against Postmodernism: A Marxist Critique]'' 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian [[John Molyneux (academic)|John Molyneux]], also of the [[Socialist Workers' Party (UK)|Socialist Workers' Party]], accuses postmodernists for "singing an old song long intoned by [[bourgeois]] historians of various persuasions".&lt;ref&gt;John Molyneux, [http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj68/molyneux.htm Is Marxism deterministic?] ''International Socialism Journal,'' Issue 68, Accessed December 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fredric Jameson]], American literary critic and Marxist political theorist, attacks postmodernism (or poststructuralism), what he claims is "the cultural logic of late capitalism", for its refusal to critically engage with the metanarratives of capitalization and [[globalization]]. The refusal renders postmodernist philosophy complicit with the prevailing relations of domination and [[Wage slavery|exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Fredric Jameson, ''Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism,''Duke UP, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Art Bollocks''==
''Art Bollocks'' is an article written by Brian Ashbee which appeared in the magazine ''[[Art Review]]'' in April 1999.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipod.org.uk/reality/art_bollocks.asp |title=Art Bollocks |publisher=Ipod.org.uk |date=1990-05-05 |archivedate=January 31, 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131083911/http://www.ipod.org.uk/reality/art_bollocks.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashbee points out the importance given to language in "post-modern" art.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The post-modern art forms mentioned by Ashbee are: "installation art, photography, conceptual art [and] video". The term [[bollocks]] in the title of course relates to nonsense.

==Sokal affair==
{{main|Sokal affair}}

[[Alan Sokal]], a physics professor at [[New York University]], formulated the [[Sokal affair]], a hoax in which he wrote a deliberately nonsensical article in a style similar to postmodernist articles. The article was enthusiastically accepted for publication by the journal ''[[Social Text]]'' despite the obvious lampooning of postmodernists view of science. Sokal liberally used vague post-modernist concepts and lingo  all the while criticising empirical approaches to knowledge. On the same day of the release he published another article in a different journal explaining the Social Text article. This was turned into a book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' which offered a critique of the practices of postmodern academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jedlitschka|first=Karsten|date=2018-08-05|title=Guenter Lewy, Harmful and Undesirable. Book Censorship in Nazi Germany. Oxford, Oxford University Press 2016|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hzhz-2018-1368|journal=Historische Zeitschrift|volume=307|issue=1|pages=274–275|doi=10.1515/hzhz-2018-1368|issn=2196-680X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mumbo Jumbo==
[[Francis Wheen]]'s book ''How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World'' broadly critiques a variety of non-critical paradigms with a significant critique of cultural relativism and the use of postmodern tropes to explain all modern geo-political phenomena. According to Wheen, postmodern scholars tend to critique unfair power structures in the west including issues of race, class, patriarchy, the effect of radical capitalism and political oppression. Where he finds fault in these tropes is when the theories go beyond evidence-based critical thinking and use vague terminology to support obscurantist theories. An example is Luce Irigaray's assertion, cited by Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont in their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'', &lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins:
 Postmodernism Disrobed. Nature, 9 July 1998, vol. 394, pp. 141-143. Full text available at: http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/dawkins.html  &lt;/ref&gt; that the equation "[[Mass–energy equivalence|E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]" is a "sexed equation", because "it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us". Relativism, according to Wheen becomes a sort of wall which shields non western cultures from the same sustained critiques. While inherent sexism in North America is open to hostile critique (as it should be according to Wheen), according to postmodern thought it is taboo to critique [[honour killing]]s and [[female genital mutilation]] in North Africa and the Middle East. Relativism will defend such taboos by claiming such cultures are out of the sphere of shared Western values and that we cannot judge other cultures by our own standards or it is defended through diminishing the severity of sexism by either denying its prominence (as Western propaganda/misunderstanding) or blaming it on menacing western factors (imperialism, globalization, western hegemony, resource exploitation and Western interference in general). Wheen admits that, while some of this may have merit, its case is highly exaggerated by relativism. Wheen reserves his strongest critique for those who defend even the most appalling systemic mistreatment of women, even in countries where Western contact and influence is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Wheen|Wheen, Francis]] (2012) [https://books.google.com/books?id=IANLeUmAh6gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22How+Mumbo-Jumbo+Conquered+the+World%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_7Mmr4oHOAhXCjJQKHVEODfMQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22How%20Mumbo-Jumbo%20Conquered%20the%20World%22&amp;f=false ''How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World: A Short History of Modern Delusions''] HarperCollins UK, {{ISBN|9780007382071}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cybersecurity firm [[CrowdStrike]] has said with a medium level of confidence that it is associated with the Russian military intelligence agency [[Main Intelligence Directorate|GRU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.valisluureamet.ee/pdf/raport-2018-ENG-web.pdf|format=PDF|title=INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND ESTONIA|date=2018|website=Valisluureamet.ee|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/2016/0615/Meet-Fancy-Bear-and-Cozy-Bear-Russian-groups-blamed-for-DNC-hack|title=Meet Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear, Russian groups blamed for DNC hack|date=15 June 2016|accessdate=4 October 2018|publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/04/uk-accuses-kremlin-of-ordering-series-of-reckless-cyber-attacks|title=UK accuses Kremlin of ordering series of 'reckless' cyber-attacks|first=Patrick|last=Wintour|date=3 October 2018|website=the Guardian|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and security firms [[SecureWorks]],&lt;ref name="SecureWorks"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-4127-targets-hillary-clinton-presidential-campaign|quote=and is gathering intelligence on behalf of the Russian government.|date=16 June 2016|title=Threat Group-4127 Targets Hillary Clinton Presidential Campaign|website=Secureworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ThreatConnect]],&lt;ref name="ThreatConnectRussia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-anti-doping-agency-phishing/|title=Russian Cyber Operations on Steroids|date=19 August 2016|website=Threatconnect.com|quote=Russian FANCY BEAR tactics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fireeye]]'s [[Mandiant]],&lt;ref name="FireeyeRussia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/10/apt28-a-window-into-russias-cyber-espionage-operations.html|title=APT28: A Window into Russia's Cyber Espionage Operations?|date=27 October 2016|website=Fireeye.com|quote=We assess that APT28 is most likely sponsored by the Russian government}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also said the group is sponsored by the Russian government. In 2018, an indictment by the United States [[Special_Counsel_investigation_(2017–present)|Special Counsel]] identified Fancy Bear as two GRU units known as '''Unit 26165''' and '''Unit 74455'''.&lt;ref name="wiredjul18"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/mueller-indictment-dnc-hack-russia-fancy-bear/|title=Indicting 12 Russian Hackers Could Be Mueller's Biggest Move Yet|website=Wired.com|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="db072018" /&gt;

The name "Fancy Bear" comes from a coding system security researcher [[Dmitri Alperovitch]] uses to identify hackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a49902/the-russian-emigre-leading-the-fight-to-protect-america/|title=The Man Leading America's Fight Against Russian Hackers Is Putin's Worst Nightmare|date=2016-10-24|website=Esquire.com|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likely operating since the mid-2000s, Fancy Bear's methods are consistent with the capabilities of state actors. The group targets government, military, and security organizations, especially [[Transcaucasia]]n and [[NATO]]-aligned states. Fancy Bear is thought to be responsible for cyber attacks on the [[Bundestag|German parliament]], the French television station [[TV5Monde]], the [[White House]], [[NATO]], the [[Democratic National Committee]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] and the campaign of French presidential candidate [[Emmanuel Macron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/08/macron-hackers-linked-to-russian-affiliated-group-behind-us-attack|title=Macron hackers linked to Russian-affiliated group behind US attack|first=Alex|last=Hern|date=8 May 2017|website=the Guardian|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group promotes the political interests of the Russian government by helping favored foreign political candidates win elections (it leaked Hillary Clinton's emails to help Donald Trump during the United States 2016 presidential elections).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hacquebord|first1=Feike|title=How Cyber Propaganda Influenced Politics in 2016|url=http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/cyber-propaganda-influenced-politics-2016/|website=TrendMicro|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fancy Bear is classified as an [[advanced persistent threat]].&lt;ref name="FireeyeRussia"/&gt; Among other things, it uses [[Zero-day (computing)|zero-day]] exploits, [[spear phishing]] and [[malware]] to compromise targets.

==Discovery and security reports==
[[Trend Micro]] designated the actors behind the Sofacy malware as '''Operation Pawn Storm''' on October 22, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gogolinski|first1=Jim|title=Operation Pawn Storm: The Red in SEDNIT|url=http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/operation-pawn-storm-the-red-in-sednit/|publisher=Trend Micro}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was due to the group's use of "two or more connected tools/tactics to attack a specific target similar to the chess strategy,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Pawn Storm: Using Decoys to Evade Detection|url=https://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-operation-pawn-storm.pdf|publisher=Trend Micro|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as [[pawn storm]].

Network security firm [[FireEye]] released a detailed report on Fancy Bear in October 2014. The report designated the group as "Advanced Persistent Threat 28" (APT28) and described how the [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]] group used [[Zero-day (computing)|zero-day]] exploits of the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system and [[Adobe Flash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Menn|first1=Joseph|title=Russian cyber attackers used two unknown flaws: security company|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/18/us-russia-cyberattack-idUSKBN0N90RQ20150418|work=Reuters|date=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report found operational details indicating that the source is a "government sponsor based in Moscow". Evidence collected by FireEye suggested that Fancy Bear's malware was compiled primarily in a [[Russian-language]] [[Computer Russification|build environment]] and occurred mainly during work hours paralleling [[Moscow Time|Moscow's time zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kumar|first1=Mohit|title=APT28 — State Sponsored Russian Hacker Group|url=http://thehackernews.com/2014/10/APT28-Russian-hacker-cyber-espionage.html|work=The Hacker News|date=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; FireEye director of threat intelligence Laura Galante referred to the group's activities as "state espionage"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mamiit|first1=Aaron|title=Meet APT28, Russian-backed malware for gathering intelligence from governments, militaries: Report|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/18995/20141030/meet-apt28-russian-backed-malware-for-gathering-intelligence-from-governments-militaries-report.htm|work=Tech Times|date=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said that targets also include "media or influencers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=APT28: A Window into Russia's Cyber Espionage Operations?|url=https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/10/apt28-a-window-into-russias-cyber-espionage-operations.html|website=FireEye.com|date=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weissman|first1=Cale Guthrie|title=France: Russian hackers posed as ISIS to hack a French TV broadcaster|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/new-discovery-indicates-that-russian-hackers-apt28-are-behind-the-tv5-monde-hack-2015-6|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Fancy Bear" is derived from the coding system that [[Dmitri Alperovitch]] uses for hacker groups. "Bear" indicates that the hackers are from Russia.

Fancy Bear's targets have included Eastern European governments and militaries, the country of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the [[Caucasus]], Ukraine,&lt;ref name="hitlist"/&gt; security-related organizations such as [[NATO]], as well as US defense contractors [[Academi]] (formerly known as Blackwater), [[Science Applications International Corporation]] (SAIC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yadron|first1=Danny|title=Hacking Trail Leads to Russia, Experts Say|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/hacking-trail-leads-to-russia-experts-say-1414468869|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon.&lt;ref name="hitlist"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Satter|first1=Raphael|last2=Donn|first2=Jeff|last3=Myers|first3=Justin|title=Digital hitlist shows Russian hacking went well beyond U.S. elections|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-russian-hacking-20171102-story.html|accessdate=10 November 2017|agency=AP|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fancy Bear has also attacked citizens of the Russian Federation that are political enemies of the Kremlin, including former oil tycoon [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]], and [[Maria Alekhina]] of the band [[Pussy Riot]].&lt;ref name="hitlist"/&gt; SecureWorks, a cybersecurity firm headquartered in the United States, concluded that from March 2015 to May 2016, the "Fancy Bear" target list included not merely the United States Democratic National Committee, but tens of thousands of foes of Putin and the Kremlin in the United States, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, and Syria. Only a handful of Republicans were targeted, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-11-02/hit-list-exposes-russian-hacking-beyond-us-elections|title=Russian hackers pursued Putin foes, not just U.S. Democrats|last=SATTER|first=RAPHAEL|date=November 1, 2017|work=US News &amp; World Report|accessdate=November 2, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|agency=[[Associated Press]]|last2=DONN|first2=JEFF}}&lt;/ref&gt; An AP analysis of 4,700 email accounts that had been attacked by Fancy Bear concluded that no country other than Russia would be interested in hacking so many very different targets that seemed to have nothing else in common other than their being of interest to the Russian government.&lt;ref name="hitlist"/&gt;

Fancy Bear also seems to try to influence political events in order for friends or allies of the Russian government to gain power.

In 2011-2012, Fancy Bear's first-stage malware was the "Sofacy" or SOURFACE implant. During 2013, Fancy Bear added more tools and backdoors, including CHOPSTICK, CORESHELL, JHUHUGIT, and ADVSTORESHELL.&lt;ref name="GReAT"/&gt;

===Attacks on prominent journalists in Russia, United States, Ukraine, Moldova, the Baltics, and elsewhere===
From mid-2014 until the fall of 2017, Fancy Bear targeted numerous journalists in the United States, Ukraine, Russia, Moldova, the Baltics, and other countries that had provided articles discrediting Putin and the Kremlin. According to the AP and SecureWorks, this group of journalists is the third largest group targeted by Fancy Bear after diplomatic personnel and U.S. Democrats. Fancy Bear's targeted list includes [[Adrian Chen]], the Armenian journalist Maria Titizian, [[Eliot Higgins]] at [[Bellingcat]], [[Ellen Barry (journalist)|Ellen Barry]] and at least 50 other [[New York Times]] reporters, at least 50 foreign correspondents based in Moscow who worked for independent news outlets, [[Josh Rogin]], a [[Washington Post]] columnist, [[Shane Harris]], a [[The Daily Beast|Daily Beast]] writer who in 2015 covered intelligence issues, [[Michael Weiss (journalist)|Michael Weiss]], a CNN security analyst, [[Jamie Kirchick]] with the [[Brookings Institution]], 30 media targets in Ukraine, many at the [[Kyiv Post]], reporters who covered the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian-backed war in eastern Ukraine]], as well as in Russia where the majority of journalists targeted by the hackers worked for independent news (e.g. [[Novaya Gazeta]] or [[Vedomosti]]) such as [[:ru:Винокурова, Екатерина Владимировна|Ekaterina Vinokurova]] at [[:ru:Znak.com|Znak.com]] and mainstream Russian journalists [[Tina Kandelaki]], [[Ksenia Sobchak]], and the Russian television anchor [[:ru:Лобков, Павел Альбертович|Pavel Lobkov]], all of which worked for [[Dozhd]].&lt;ref name=JournalistsTargeted&gt;{{cite news | title = Russian hackers hunted journalists in years-long campaign | url = http://www.staradvertiser.com/2017/12/22/breaking-news/russian-hackers-hunted-journalists-in-years-long-campaign/ | newspaper = Star-Advertiser | location = Honolulu | agency = Associated Press | date = December 22, 2017 | access-date = December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German attack (2014)===
Fancy Bear is thought to have been responsible for a six-month-long [[cyber-attack]] on the [[Bundestag|German parliament]] that began in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian Hackers Suspected In Cyberattack On German Parliament|url=http://www.lse.co.uk/AllNews.asp?code=kwdwehme&amp;headline=Russian_Hackers_Suspected_In_Cyberattack_On_German_Parliament|work=London South East|publisher=Alliance News|date=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group is also suspected to be behind a [[spear phishing]] attack in August 2016 on members of the [[Bundestag]] and multiple political parties such as [[The Left (Germany)|Linken]]-faction leader [[Sahra Wagenknecht]], [[Junge Union]] and the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] of [[Saarland]].&lt;ref name=dw1&gt;{{cite web|title=Hackers lurking, parliamentarians told|url=http://www.dw.com/en/hackers-lurking-parliamentarians-told/a-19564630|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hackerangriff auf deutsche Parteien|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/bundesregierung-ist-alarmiert-hackerangriff-aufdeutsche-parteien-1.3170347|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holland|first1=Martin|title=Angeblich versuchter Hackerangriff auf Bundestag und Parteien|url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Angeblich-versuchter-Hackerangriff-auf-Bundestag-und-Parteien-3328265.html|publisher=Heise|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Wir haben Fingerabdrücke"|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/hackerangriffe-auf-politiker-wir-haben-fingerabdruecke-14445655.html|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities feared that sensitive information could be gathered by hackers to later manipulate the public ahead of elections such as Germany's next federal election which was due in September 2017.&lt;ref name=dw1/&gt;

===U.S. military wives' death threats (February 10, 2015)===
Five military wives received death threats from a hacker group calling itself "CyberCaliphate", claiming to be an Islamic State affiliate, on February 10, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/russian-hackers-isis-militant-posers-military-wives-threat|title=Russian Hackers Who Posed As ISIS Militants Threatened Military Wives|website=Talkingpointsmemo.com|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CyberCaliphate CT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/report-russian-hackers-posed-as-isis-to-attack-u-s-mi-1825855349|title=Report: Russian Hackers Posed as ISIS to Attack U.S. Military Wives|first=Jennings|last=Brown|website=gizmodo.com|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/4d174e45ef5843a0ba82e804f080988f/Russians-posed-as-IS-hackers,-threatened-US-military-wives|title=Russian hackers posed as IS to threaten military wives|website=Apnews.com|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later discovered to have been a false flag attack by Fancy Bear, when the victims' email addresses were found to have been in the Fancy Bear phishing target list.&lt;ref name="CyberCaliphate CT"/&gt; Russian social media trolls have also been known to hype and rumor monger the threat of potential Islamic State terror attacks on U.S. soil in order to sow fear and political tension.&lt;ref name="CyberCaliphate CT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-bc-eu--russian-hackers-spouses-20180508-story.html|title=Russian hackers posed as IS to threaten military wives|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French television hack (April 2015)===
On April 8, 2015, French television network [[TV5Monde]] was the victim of a cyber-attack by a hacker group calling itself "CyberCaliphate" and claiming to have ties to the terrorist organization [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL). French investigators later discounted the theory that militant Islamists were behind the cyber-attack, instead suspecting the involvement of Fancy Bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France probes Russian lead in TV5Monde hacking: sources|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/10/us-france-russia-cybercrime-idUSKBN0OQ2GG20150610|accessdate=9 July 2015|work=Reuters|date=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hackers breached the network's internal systems, possibly aided by passwords openly broadcast by TV5,&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/04/hacked-french-network-exposed-its-own-passwords-during-tv-interview/ Hacked French network exposed its own passwords during TV interview] - arstechnica&lt;/ref&gt; overriding the broadcast programming of the company's 12 channels for over three hours.&lt;ref name=DT&gt;{{cite news|title=Isil hackers seize control of France's TV5Monde network in 'unprecedented' attack |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11525016/Isil-hackers-seize-control-of-Frances-TV5Monde-network-in-unprecedented-attack.html|accessdate=April 10, 2015|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Service was only partially restored in the early hours of the following morning and normal broadcasting services were disrupted late into April 9.&lt;ref name=DT/&gt; Various computerised internal administrative and support systems including e-mail were also still shut down or otherwise inaccessible due to the attack.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|title=French media groups to hold emergency meeting after Isis cyber-attack |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/09/french-tv-network-tv5monde-hijacked-by-pro-isis-hackers|accessdate=April 10, 2015|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DT/&gt; The hackers also hijacked TV5Monde's [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] pages to [[Doxing|post the personal information of]] relatives of French soldiers participating in actions against ISIS, along with messages critical of President [[François Hollande]], arguing that [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks|the January 2015 terrorist attacks]] were "gifts" for his "unforgivable mistake" of partaking in conflicts that "[serve] no purpose".&lt;ref name="independent-isiltv5"&gt;{{cite news|title=French TV network TV5Monde 'hacked by cyber caliphate in unprecedented attack' that revealed personal details of French soldiers|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/french-tv-network-tv5monde-hijacked-by-isis-hackers-in-unprecedented-attack-that-revealed-personal-details-of-french-soldiers-10164285.html|accessdate=April 9, 2015|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DT/&gt;

The director-general of TV5Monde, Yves Bigot,  later said that the attack nearly destroyed the company; if it had taken longer to restore broadcasting, satellite distribution channels would have been likely to cancel their contracts. The attack was designed to be destructive, both of equipment and of the company itself, rather than for propaganda or espionage, as had been the case for most other cyber-attacks. The attack was carefully planned; the first known penetration of the network was on January 23, 2015.&lt;ref name="Comae"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blog.comae.io/lessons-from-tv5monde-2015-hack-c4d62f07849d |title=Lessons from TV5Monde 2015 Hack |first=Matt |last=Suiche |publisher=Comae Technologies |date=June 10, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613120537/https://blog.comae.io/lessons-from-tv5monde-2015-hack-c4d62f07849d?gi=ed8e6819c991 |archive-date=June 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers then carried out reconnaissance of TV5Monde to understand the way in which it broadcast its signals, and constructed bespoke malicious software to corrupt and destroy the Internet-connected hardware that controlled the TV station's operations, such as the encoder systems. They used seven different points of entry, not all part of TV5Monde or even in France—one was a company based in the Netherlands that supplied the remote controlled cameras used in TV5's studios.&lt;ref name="Comae"/&gt; Between February 16 and March 25 the attackers collected data on TV5 internal platforms, including its IT Internal [[Wiki]], and verified that login credentials were still valid.&lt;ref name="Comae"/&gt; During the attack, the hackers ran a series of commands extracted from [[TACACS]] logs to erase the [[firmware]] from switches and [[Router (computing)|routers]].&lt;ref name="Comae"/&gt;

Although the attack purported to be from IS, France's cyber-agency told Bigot to say only that the messages ''claimed to be'' from IS. He was later told that evidence had been found that the attackers were the APT 28 group of Russian hackers. No reason was found for the targeting of TV5Monde, and the source of the order to attack, and funding for it, is not known. It has been speculated that it was probably an attempt to test forms of cyber-weaponry. The cost was estimated at €5m ($5.6m; £4.5m) in the first year, followed by recurring annual cost of over €3m (£3.4m; £2.7m) for new protection. The company's way of working had to change, with authentication of email, checking of flash drives before insertion, and so on, at significant detriment to efficiency for a news media company that must move information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37590375 |title=How France's TV5 was almost destroyed by 'Russian hackers' |website=BBC News |date=10 October 2016  |author=Gordon Corera |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Root9B report (May 2015)===
Security firm Root9B released a report on Fancy Bear in May 2015 announcing its discovery of a targeted spear phishing attack aimed at financial institutions. The report listed international banking institutions that were targeted, including the [[United Bank for Africa]], [[Bank of America]], [[Toronto-Dominion Bank|TD Bank]], and UAE Bank. According to the Root9B, preparations for the attacks started in June 2014 and the malware used "bore specific signatures that have historically been unique to only one organization, Sofacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Danielle|title=APT28 orchestrated attacks against global banking sector, firm finds|url=http://www.scmagazine.com/apt28-orchestrated-attacks-against-global-banking-sector-firm-finds/printarticle/414586/|work=SC Magazine|date=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security journalist [[Brian Krebs]] questioned the accuracy of Root9B's claims, postulating that the attacks had actually originated from Nigerian phishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Firm Redefines APT: African Phishing Threat|url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/05/security-firm-redefines-apt-african-phishing-threat/|publisher=Krebs on Security|date=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015 well respected security researcher Claudio Guarnieri published a report based on his own investigation of a concurrent SOFACY attributed exploit against the German Bundestag &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://netzpolitik.org/2015/digital-attack-on-german-parliament-investigative-report-on-the-hack-of-the-left-party-infrastructure-in-bundestag/|title=Digital Attack on German Parliament: Investigative Report on the Hack of the Left Party Infrastructure in Bundestag|website=netzpolitik.org|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and credited root9B with having reported, "the same IP address used as Command &amp; Control server in the attack against Bundestag (176.31.112.10)", and went on to say that based on his examination of the Bundestag attack, "at least some" indicators contained within root9B's report appeared accurate, including a comparison of the hash of the malware sample from both incidents.  Root9B later published a technical report comparing Claudio's analysis of SOFACY attributed malware to their own sample, adding to the veracity of their original report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.root9b.com/sites/default/files/whitepapers/root9b_follow_up_report_apt28.pdf|title=Nothing found for Products Orkos Dfd|website=www.root9b.com|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EFF spoof, White House and NATO attack (August 2015)===
In August 2015, Fancy Bear used a zero-day exploit of [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Spoofing attack|spoofing]] the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and launching attacks on the [[White House]] and [[NATO]]. The hackers used a spear phishing attack, directing emails to the false url electronicfrontierfoundation.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doctorow|first1=Cory|title=Spear phishers with suspected ties to Russian government spoof fake EFF domain, attack White House|url=http://boingboing.net/2015/08/28/spear-phishers-with-suspected.html|work=Boing Boing|date=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quintin|first1=Cooper|title=New Spear Phishing Campaign Pretends to be EFF|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/new-spear-phishing-campaign-pretends-be-eff|website=Eff.org|date=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Anti-Doping Agency (August 2016)===
In August 2016, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] reported the receipt of [[phishing]] emails sent to users of its database claiming to be official WADA communications requesting their login details. After reviewing the two domains provided by WADA, it was found that the websites' registration and hosting information were consistent with the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/russian-hackers-fancy-bear-likely-breached-olympic-drug-testing-agency-dnc-experts-say-1577508 |title=Russian hackers 'Fancy Bear' likely breached Olympic drug-testing agency and DNC, experts say|author=Hyacinth Mascarenhas|work=[[International Business Times]]| date=August 23, 2016| accessdate =September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/37374053/what-we-know-about-fancy-bears-hack-team | title=What we know about Fancy Bears hack team | publisher=[[BBC News]] | accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to WADA, some of the data the hackers released had been forged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallagher|first1=Sean|title=Researchers find fake data in Olympic anti-doping, Guccifer 2.0 Clinton dumps|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/10/researchers-find-fake-data-in-olympic-anti-doping-guccifer-2-0-clinton-dumps/|accessdate=26 October 2016|publisher=Ars Technica|date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to evidence of widespread [[Doping in Russia|doping by Russian athletes]], WADA recommended that Russian athletes be barred from participating in the 2016 Rio Olympics and Paralympics. Analysts said they believed the hack was in part an act of retaliation against whistleblowing Russian athlete [[Yuliya Stepanova]], whose personal information was released in the breach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/22/russian-hackers-world-anti-doping-agency-dnc-hack-fancy-bear|title=Same Russian hackers likely breached Olympic drug-testing agency and DNC|last=Thielman|first=Sam|date=August 22, 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, WADA revealed that their systems had been breached, explaining that hackers from Fancy Bear had used an [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC)-created account to gain access to their Anti-doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS) database.&lt;ref name="NBC News"/&gt; The hackers then used the website fancybear.net to leak what they said were the Olympic drug testing files of several athletes who had received therapeutic use exemptions, including gymnast [[Simone Biles]], tennis players [[Venus Williams|Venus]] and [[Serena Williams]] and basketball player [[Elena Delle Donne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Athletes Caught Doping|url=http://fancybear.net/pages/1.html|website=Fancybear.net|date=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hackers honed in on athletes who had been granted exemptions by WADA for various reasons.

===Dutch Safety Board and Bellingcat===
[[Eliot Higgins]] and other journalists associated with Bellingcat, a group researching the shoot down of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] over Ukraine, were targeted by numerous spearphishing emails. The messages were fake Gmail security notices with Bit.ly and TinyCC shortened URLs. According to [[ThreatConnect]], some of the phishing emails had originated from servers that Fancy Bear had used in previous attacks elsewhere. Bellingcat is best known for having accused Russia of being culpable for the shoot down of MH17, and is frequently derided in the Russian media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=Russian hackers harassed journalists who were investigating Malaysia Airlines plane crash|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-hackers-harass-researchers-who-documented-russian-involvement-in-shootdown-of-malaysian-jetliner-over-ukraine-in-2014/2016/09/28/d086c8bc-84f7-11e6-ac72-a29979381495_story.html|accessdate=26 October 2016|date=28 September 2016|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ThreatConnect|title=ThreatConnect reviews activity targeting Bellingcat, a key contributor in the MH17 investigation.|url=https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/russia-hacks-bellingcat-mh17-investigation/|website=ThreatConnect|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group targeted the [[Dutch Safety Board]], the body conducting the official investigation into the crash, before and after the release of the board's final report. They set up fake SFTP and VPN servers to mimic the board's own servers, likely for the purpose of [[spearphishing]] usernames and passwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/pawn-storm-targets-mh17-investigation-team/|title=Pawn Storm Targets MH17 Investigation Team|author=Feike Hacquebord|website=Trend Micro|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the DSB said the attacks were not successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msn.com/en-au/news/world/russia-tried-to-hack-mh17-inquiry-system/ar-BBmmuuT|title=Russia 'tried to hack MH17 inquiry system'|agency=AFP|date=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic National Committee (2016)===
Fancy Bear carried out spear phishing attacks on email addresses associated with the [[Democratic National Committee]] in the first quarter of 2016.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanger|first1=David E.|last2=Corasaniti|first2=Nick|title=D.N.C.

One of these accounts may have yielded up to date contact lists. The next day, phishing attacks expanded to the non-public email addresses of high level Democratic Party officials. Hillaryclinton.com addresses were attacked, but required two factor authentication for access. The attack redirected towards Gmail accounts on March 19th. Podesta's Gmail account was breached the same day, with 50,000 emails stolen. The phishing attacks intensified in April,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Satter|first1=Raphael|last2=Donn|first2=Jeff|last3=Day|first3=Chad|title=Inside story: How Russians hacked the Democrats’ emails|url=https://www.apnews.com/dea73efc01594839957c3c9a6c962b8a/Inside-story:-How-Russians-hacked-the-Democrats%27-emails|accessdate=10 November 2017|agency=AP|date=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the hackers seemed to become suddenly inactive for the day on April 15, which in Russia was a holiday in honor of the military's electronic warfare services.&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{cite news|title=Bear on bear|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21707574-whats-worse-being-attacked-russian-hacker-being-attacked-two-bear-bear|accessdate=14 December 2016|work=The Economist|date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;The malware used in the attack sent stolen data to the same servers that were used for the group's 2015 attack on the [[Bundestag|German parliament]].&lt;ref name="Esq"/&gt;

On June 14, CrowdStrike released a report publicizing the DNC hack and identifying Fancy Bear as the culprits. An online persona, [[Guccifer 2.0]], then appeared, claiming sole credit for the breach.&lt;ref name="Alperovitch"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alperovitch|first1=Dmitri|title=Bears in the Midst: Intrusion into the Democratic National Committee »|url=https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/|website=Crowdstrike.com|date=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another sophisticated hacking group attributed to the Russian Federation, nicknamed [[Cozy Bear]], was also present in the DNC's servers at the same time. However the two groups each appeared to be unaware of the other, as each independently stole the same passwords and otherwise duplicated their efforts. Cozy Bear appears to be a different agency, one more interested in traditional long-term espionage.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; A CrowdStrike forensic team determined that while Cozy Bear had been on the DNC's network for over a year, Fancy Bear had only been there a few weeks.&lt;ref name="Esq"/&gt;

According to [[CrowdStrike]] from 2014 to 2016, the group used Android malware to target the Ukrainian Army's [[Rocket Forces and Artillery (Ukraine)|Rocket Forces and Artillery]]. They distributed an infected version of an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Mobile app|app]] whose original purpose was to control targeting data for the [[122 mm howitzer 2A18 (D-30)|D-30 Howitzer]] artillery. The app, used by Ukrainian officers, was loaded with the [[X Agent (spyware)|X-Agent]] spyware and posted online on military forums. CrowdStrike initially claimed that more than 80% of Ukrainian D-30 Howitzers were destroyed in the war, the highest percentage loss of any artillery pieces in the army (a percentage that had never been previously reported and would mean the loss of nearly the entire arsenal of the biggest artillery piece of the [[Ukrainian Armed Forces]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraines-military-denies-russian-hack-attack-143419289.html |title=Ukraine's military denies Russian hack attack |work=Yahoo!

===Windows zero-day (October 2016)===
On October 31, 2016, [[Google]]'s Threat Analysis Group revealed a [[Zero-day (computing)|zero-day]] vulnerability in most [[Microsoft Windows]] versions that is the subject of active malware attacks. On November 1, 2016, Microsoft Executive Vice President of the Windows and Devices Group [[Terry Myerson]] posted to Microsoft's Threat Research &amp; Response Blog, acknowledging the vulnerability and explaining that a "low-volume spear-phishing campaign" targeting specific users had utilized "two zero-day vulnerabilities in [[Adobe Flash]] and the down-level Windows kernel." Microsoft pointed to Fancy Bear as the threat actor, referring to the group by their in-house code name ''STRONTIUM''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gallagher |first=Sean |url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/11/windows-zero-day-exploited-by-same-group-behind-dnc-hack/ |title=Windows zero-day exploited by same group behind DNC hack |date=1 November 2016 |work=Ars Technica |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch ministries (February 2017)===
In February 2017, the [[General Intelligence and Security Service]] (AIVD) of the [[Netherlands]] revealed that Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear had made several attempts to hack into Dutch ministries, including the [[Ministry of General Affairs]], over the previous six months. [[Rob Bertholee]], head of the AIVD, said on ''[[EenVandaag]]'' that the hackers were Russian and had tried to gain access to secret government documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Modderkolk|first1=Huib|title=Russen faalden bij hackpogingen ambtenaren op Nederlandse ministeries |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/tech/russische-hackers-probeerden-binnen-te-dringen-bij-ministerie-algemene-zaken~a4457869/|work=De Volkskrant|date=February 4, 2017|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a briefing to parliament, Dutch Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations [[Ronald Plasterk]] announced that votes for the [[Dutch general election, 2017|Dutch general election]] in March 2017 would be counted by hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cluskey|first1=Peter|title=Dutch opt for manual count after reports of  Russian hacking|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/dutch-opt-for-manual-count-after-reports-of-russian-hacking-1.2962777|work=The Irish Times|date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IAAF hack (February 2017)===

The officials of [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) stated in April 2017 that its servers had been hacked by the "Fancy Bear" group. The attack was detected by cybersecurity firm Context Information Security which identified that an unauthorised remote access to IAAF's servers had taken place on February 21. IAAF stated that the hackers had accessed the ''Therapeutic Use Exemption'' applications, needed to use medications prohibited by WADA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=James|title=International athletics body IAAF hacked, warns that athletes' data may be compromised|url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/04/03/international-athletics-body-iaaf-hacked-warns-that-athletes-data-may-be-compromised.html|work=Fox News|date=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IAAF Says It Has Been Hacked, Athlete Medical Info Accessed|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/iaaf-hack-fancy-bears/3793874.html|work=Associated Press|publisher=Voice of America|date=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German and French elections (2016–2017)===
{{see also|French presidential election, 2017|German federal election, 2017|2017 Macron e-mail leaks}}
Researchers from [[Trend Micro]] in 2017 released a report outlining attempts by Fancy Bear to target groups related to the election campaigns of [[Emmanuel Macron]] and [[Angela Merkel]]. According to the report, they targeted the Macron campaign with phishing and attempting to install malware on their site. French government cybersecurity agency [[Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information|ANSSI]] confirmed these attacks took place, but could not confirm APT28's responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-macron-cyber-idUSKBN17Q200|title=Macron campaign was target of cyber attacks by spy-linked group|date=24 April 2017|author=Eric Auchard|website=Reuters.com|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The APT group did not target [[Marine Le Pen]], further showing Russia's involvement in the French Elections, since Putin has expressed his interest and hopes in Marine Le Pen's victory for both political and financial gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/010eec62-30b5-11e7-9555-23ef563ecf9a|title=Putin awaits return on Le Pen investment|last=|first=|date=May 4, 2017|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505120813/https://www.ft.com/content/010eec62-30b5-11e7-9555-23ef563ecf9a|archive-date=May 5, 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report says they then targeted the German [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]] and [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]], groups that are associated with Angela Merkel's [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] and opposition [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]], respectively. Fancy Bear set up fake email servers in late 2016 to send phishing emails with links to malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/russia-linked-hackers-target-german-political-foundations-755236|title=Russia-linked Hackers Target German Political Foundations|date=26 April 2017|publisher=Handelsblatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Olympic Committee (2018)===
On January 10, 2018, the "Fancy Bears Hack Team" online persona leaked what appeared to be stolen [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and [[U.S. Olympic Committee]] emails, dated from late 2016 to early 2017, were leaked in apparent retaliation for the [[Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics|IOC's banning of Russian athletes from the 2018 Winter Olympics]] as a sanction for [[Doping in Russia|Russia's systematic doping program]]. The attack resembles the earlier [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) leaks. It is not known whether the emails are fully authentic, because of Fancy Bear's history of salting stolen emails with disinformation. The mode of attack was also not known, but was probably phishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matsakis|first1=Louise|title=Hack Brief: Russian Hackers Release Apparent IOC Emails in Wake of Olympics Ban|url=https://www.wired.com/story/russian-fancy-bears-hackers-release-apparent-ioc-emails/|magazine=Wired|date=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca R.

Cyber Security experts have also claimed that attacks also appear to have been targeting the professional sports drug test bottling company known as the Berlinger Group.

===Swedish Sports Confederation===
The [[Swedish Sports Confederation]] reported Fancy Bear was responsible for an attack on its computers, targeting records of athletes' doping tests.&lt;ref name="sweden"&gt;{{cite news |title=Swedish sports body says anti-doping unit hit by hacking attack |publisher=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sweden-doping/swedish-sports-body-says-anti-doping-unit-hit-by-hacking-attack-idUSKCN1IG2GN |date=May 15, 2018 |first=Simon |last=Johnson |first2=Olof |last2=Swahnberg |editor-first=Niklas |editor-last=Pollard |editor-first2=Hugh |editor-last2=Lawson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States conservative groups (2018) ===
The software company [[Microsoft]] reported in August 2018 that the group had attempted to steal data from political organizations such as the [[International Republican Institute]] and the [[Hudson Institute|Hudson Institute think tanks]]. The attacks were thwarted when Microsoft security staff won control of six [[Windows domain|net domains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45257081|title=Microsoft 'halts Russian political hack'|date=2018-08-21|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its announcement Microsoft advised that "we currently have no evidence these domains were used in any successful attacks before the DCU transferred control of them, nor do we have evidence to indicate the identity of the ultimate targets of any planned attack involving these domains". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Brad |title=We are taking new steps against broadening threats to democracy |url=https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/08/20/we-are-taking-new-steps-against-broadening-threats-to-democracy/ |website=Microsoft |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Ecumenical Patriarchate and other clergy (August 2018) ===
According to the August 2018 report by the [[Associated Press]], Fancy Bear had been for years targeting the email correspondence of the officials of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] headed by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] [[Bartholomew I of Constantinople|Bartholomew I]].&lt;ref name="bloombergclergy"&gt;{{cite web |author=Raphael Satter |work=Associated Press |title=Russian Cyberspies Spent Years Targeting Orthodox Clergy|publisher=Bloomberg |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-27/unholy-hackers-orthodox-clergy-targeted-by-russian-spies|date=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication appeared at a time of heightened tensions between the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the seniormost of all the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, and the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (the Moscow Patriarchate) over the issue of the [[Autocephaly|full ecclesiastical independence]] ([[autocephaly]]) for the [[Religion in Ukraine#Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church in Ukraine]], sought after by the Ukrainian government. The publication cited experts as saying that the grant of autocephaly to the Church in Ukraine would erode the power and prestige of the Moscow Patriarchate and would undermine its claims of transnational jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="bloombergclergy" /&gt; Cyber attacks also targeted Orthodox Christians in other countries as well as Muslims, Jews and Catholics in the United States, Ummah, an umbrella group for Ukrainian Muslims, the papal nuncio in Kiev and Yosyp Zisels, who directs Ukraine's Association of Jewish Organizations and Communities.&lt;ref name="bloombergclergy" /&gt;

===Indictments in 2018===
In October 2018, an indictment by a [[federal grand jury]] of seven Russian men, all GRU officers, in relation to the attacks was unsealed. The indictment states that from December 2014 until a least May 2018, the GRU officers conspired to condict "persistent and sophisticated computer intrusions affecting U.S. persons, corporate entities, international organizations, and their respective employees located around the world, based on their strategic interest to the Russian government."&lt;ref name="Penn"&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-gru-officers-international-hacking-and-related-influence-and|title=U.S. Charges Russian GRU Officers with International Hacking and Related Influence and Disinformation Operations|publisher=United States Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doj7"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4954141/Indictment-7-GRU-Officers-Oct2018.pdf |first=Scott W. |last=Brady |title=Indictment 7 GRU Officers_Oct2018 |access-date=July 8, 2018 |publisher=[[United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Department of Justice stated that the conspiracy, among other goals, aimed "to publicize stolen information as part of an influence and disinformation campaign designed to undermine, retaliate against, and otherwise delegitimize" the efforts of the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]], an international anti-doping organization that had published the ''[[McLaren Report]]'', a report that exposed [[Doping in Russia|extensive doping of Russian athletes sponsored by the Russian government]].&lt;ref name="Penn"/&gt; The defendants were charged with [[computer hacking]], [[wire fraud]], aggravated [[identity theft]], and [[money laundering]].&lt;ref name="Penn"/&gt;

==Characteristics and techniques==
[[File:APT28 APT29 Techniques - Malware.png|thumb|Diagram showing Grizzly Steppe's (Fancy Bear and [[Cozy Bear]]) process of employing [[spear phishing]]]]
Fancy Bear employs advanced methods consistent with the capabilities of state actors.&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt; They use [[spear phishing]] emails, malware drop websites disguised as news sources, and [[Zero-day (computing)|zero-day]] vulnerabilities. One cybersecurity research group noted their use of no less than six different zero-day exploits in 2015, a considerable technical feat that would require large numbers of programmers seeking out previously unknown vulnerabilities in top of the line commercial software. This is a sign that Fancy Bear is a state-run program and not a gang or a lone hacker.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/29/cozy-bear-fancy-bear-russia-hack-dnc|title=Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear: did Russians hack Democratic party and if so, why?|last=Thielman|first=Sam|date=29 July 2016|last2=Ackerman|first2=Spencer|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cluley|first1=Graham|title=New ESET research paper puts Sednit under the microscope|url=http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/10/20/new-eset-research-paper-puts-sednit-under-the-microscope/|website=WeLiveSecurity|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Fancy Bear's preferred targets is web-based email services. A typical compromise will consist of web-based email users receiving an email urgently requesting that they change their passwords to avoid being hacked. The email will contain a link to a spoof website that is designed to mimic a real webmail interface, users will attempt to login and their credentials will be stolen. The URL is often obscured as a shortened [[bit.ly]] link&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frenkel|first1=Sheera|title=Meet Fancy Bear, The Russian Group Hacking The US Election|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/meet-fancy-bear-the-russian-group-hacking-the-us-election|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to get past [[spam filter]]s. Fancy Bear sends these phishing emails primarily on Mondays and Fridays. They also send emails purportedly containing links to news items, but instead linking to malware drop sites that install [[toolkits]] onto the target's computer.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt; Fancy Bear also registers domains that resemble legitimate websites, then create a spoof of the site to steal credentials from their victims.&lt;ref name="Alperovitch"/&gt; Fancy Bear has been known to relay its command traffic through proxy networks of victims that it has previously compromised.&lt;ref name="FireEye"/&gt;

Software that Fancy Bear has used includes ADVSTORESHELL, CHOPSTICK, JHUHUGIT, and XTunnel. Fancy Bear utilises a number of implants, including Foozer, WinIDS, [[X Agent (spyware)|X-Agent]], X-Tunnel, Sofacy, and DownRange droppers.&lt;ref name="Alperovitch"/&gt; Based on compile times, FireEye concluded that Fancy Bear has consistently updated their malware since 2007.&lt;ref name="FireEye"/&gt; To avert detection, Fancy Bear returns to the environment to switch their implants, changes its [[Command and control (malware)|command and control]] channels, and modifies its persistent methods.&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Teri|title=Russian hackers access Trump files in DNC hack|url=https://www.scmagazine.com/russian-hackers-access-trump-files-in-dnc-hack/article/529426/|work=SC Magazine US|date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat group implements counter-analysis techniques to [[data masking|obfuscate their code]]. They add junk data to encoded strings, making decoding difficult without the junk removal algorithm.&lt;ref name="FireEye"&gt;{{cite web|title=APT28: A Window Into Russia's Cyber Espionage Operations?|url=https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-apt28.pdf|website=Fireeye.com|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fancy Bear takes measures to prevent [[Digital forensics|forensic analysis]] of its hacks, resetting the timestamps on files and periodically clearing the event logs.&lt;ref name="Alperovitch"/&gt;

According to an indictment by the United States Special Counsel, X-Agent was "developed, customized, and monitored" by GRU Lieutenant Captain Nikolay Yuryevich Kozachek.&lt;ref name="db072018"/&gt;

Fancy Bear has been known to tailor implants for target environments, for instance reconfiguring them to use local email servers.&lt;ref name="FireEye"/&gt; In August 2015, Kaspersky Lab detected and blocked a version of the ADVSTORESHELL implant that had been used to target defense contractors. An hour and a half following the block, Fancy Bear actors had compiled and delivered a new backdoor for the implant.&lt;ref name="GReAT"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Kaspersky Lab's Global Research &amp; Analysis Team|title=Sofacy APT hits high profile targets with updated toolset - Securelist|url=https://securelist.com/blog/research/72924/sofacy-apt-hits-high-profile-targets-with-updated-toolset/|work=Securelist|date=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fancy Bear sometimes creates online personas to sow disinformation, deflect blame, and create plausible deniability for their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hacktivists vs Faketivists: Fancy Bears in Disguise|url=https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/faketivist-vs-hacktivist-how-they-differ/|website=Threatconnect.com|date=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fancy Bears' Hack Team===
A website created to leak documents taken in the WADA and IAAF attacks was fronted with a brief manifesto dated September 13, 2016, proclaiming that the site is owned by "Fancy Bears' hack team", which it said is an "international hack team" who "stand for fair play and clean sport".&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt; The site took responsibility for hacking WADA and promised that it would provide "sensational proof of famous athletes taking doping substances", beginning with the US Olympic team, which it said "disgraced its name by tainted victories".&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt; WADA said some of the documents leaked under this name were forgeries, and that data had been changed.&lt;ref name=changed&gt;{{cite news|last1=BBC|title=Fancy Bears doping data 'may have been changed' says Wada|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/37570246|accessdate=3 November 2016|agency=BBC|date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bartlett|first1=Evan|title=Fancy Bears: Who are the shady hacking group exposing doping, cover-ups and corruption in sport?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/fancy-bears-who-are-hacking-group-doping-sport-football-russia-georgia-reedie-bach-a7906376.html|accessdate=24 May 2018|agency=The Independent|date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''February Countercurrent''' ({{zh|c=二月逆流|p=''Èryuè nìliú''}}), also known as the '''February Adverse Current'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/subject/china/documents/cpc/history/01.htm|title=Resolution on CPC History|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, refers to the joint efforts by a group of [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] veterans to oppose the ultra-leftist radicalism at the beginning of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The events refer mainly to a series of stormy meetings of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China]] and the top military brass which took place between January and February, 1967, which pitted Communist revolutionary generals [[Tan Zhenlin]], [[Chen Yi (general)|Chen Yi]], [[Xu Xiangqian]], [[Nie Rongzhen]], and others against Maoist radicals led by [[Lin Biao]], [[Kang Sheng]], [[Jiang Qing]], and [[Zhang Chunqiao]]. The veterans asserted that the Cultural Revolution was throwing the country into chaos and that its real aim was to purge the top leadership of the party and the military. Mao did not come into face-to-face conflict with the generals but tacitly disapproved of their actions. The generals were denounced by Lin Biao at the Twelfth Plenum of the 8th Party Congress in October 1968 as a "serious anti-party act".&lt;ref name=duowei&gt;{{cite news|title=多维历史：陈丕显亲述二月逆流真相|url=http://history.dwnews.com/news/2013-08-08/59303667-all.html|publisher=''Duowei News''|date=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Mao backtracked on the official designation given to the February Countercurrent after the death of Chen Yi at a time when Mao felt increasingly politically isolated. Mao rushed out of bed to make an impromptu appearance at Chen Yi's funeral, signalling his attempt to reach out to the old comrades who have been purged or otherwise harmed during the Cultural Revolution.

The post-Mao Communist Party reversed the verdict on the February Countercurrent; it is rarely discussed in mainland China today.

[[File:Galerius follis.jpg|thumb|A follis of [[Galerius]] as caesar.]]

The '''follis''' (plural ''folles''; {{lang-it|follaro}}, {{lang-ar|fels}}) was a type of coin in the  [[Roman currency|Roman]] and [[Byzantine coinage|Byzantine]] traditions.

==Roman coin==
[[File:Roman Imperial Follis Caesar Constantius II 325.jpg|left|thumb|Caesar [[Constantius II]] on a follis AE3 of [[Heraclea Lucania|Heraclea]] of the year 325.]]
In the past the word 'follis' was used to describe a large [[bronze]] Roman [[coin]] introduced in about 294 (the actual name of this coin is unknown &lt;ref&gt;[http://dougsmith.ancients.info/voc5.html Describing ancient coins] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006081242/http://dougsmith.ancients.info/voc5.html |date=6 October 2006 }} — accessed on 5 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;)
at the time of the [[coinage reform of Diocletian]]. It weighed about 10&amp;nbsp;grams and was about 4% silver, mostly as a thin layer on the surface. However, later studies have shown that this is wrong, and that this coin may have been known as a 'nummus'. The word ''follis'' means bag (usually made of leather) in Latin, and there is evidence that this term was used in antiquity for a [[Seal (device)|sealed]] bag containing a specific amount of coinage. It has also been suggested that the coin was named Follis because of the ancient Greek word "φολίς" meaning a thin layer of metal (''cf.'' Latin ''[[wiktionary:folium#Latin|folium]]'', "[[Metal leaf|leaf]]") which covers the surface of various objects, since originally, this coin had a thin layer of silver on top. The 'follis' of Diocletian, despite efforts to enforce prices with the [[Edict on Maximum Prices]] (301), was revalued and reduced as time passed. By the time of [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine]], it was smaller and barely contained any silver. A series of [[Constantinian bronzes]] was introduced in the mid-4th century, although the specific denominations are unclear and debated by historians and numismatists. They are referred to as AE1, AE2, AE3 and AE4, with the former being the largest (near 27&amp;nbsp;mm) and the latter the smallest (averaging 15&amp;nbsp;mm) in diameter. Namely:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;" border="1" 
|-
! AE1 !! AE2 !! AE3 !! AE4

|-
|  over 25&amp;nbsp;mm || 21 – 25&amp;nbsp;mm  ||  17 – 21&amp;nbsp;mm ||  under 17&amp;nbsp;mm 
|}

Fourth century ''folles'' represent the largest category of coin finds in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finds.org.uk/romancoins An introduction to Roman coins] — accessed on 13 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Follis-Constantine VII and Zoe-sb1758.jpg|thumb| [[Constantine VII]] and [[Zoe Karbonopsina|Zoe]].]]
The follis was reintroduced as a large bronze coin (40 nummi) in 498, with the [[coinage reform of Anastasius]], which included a series of bronze denominations with their values marked in [[Greek numeral]]s. A 40 nummi coin of [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius]] is depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] 50 [[Macedonian denar|denars]] banknote, issued in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbrm.gov.mk National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia].

The [[fals]] (a corruption of ''follis'') was a bronze coin issued by the [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] [[caliphate]]s beginning in the late 8th century, initially as imitations of the Byzantine follis.

'''''Greek Homosexuality''''' (1978; second edition 1989; third edition 2016) is a book about [[homosexuality in ancient Greece]] by the classical scholar [[Kenneth Dover]], in which the author uses archaic and classical [[archaeological]] and [[literature|literary]] sources to discuss ancient Greek sexual behavior and attitudes. He addresses the iconography of vase paintings, the speeches in the law courts, and the comedies of [[Aristophanes]], as well as the content of other literary and philosophical [[source text]]s.

The first modern scholarly work on its topic, ''Greek Homosexuality'' received some negative reviews but was enormously influential, helping to shape the views of other classicists. Dover has been praised for discussion of sexual practices such as [[Intercrural sex|intercrural copulation]].

==Summary==
[[Image:Pederastic courtship Louvre CA3096 n2.jpg|thumb|160px|left|In this detail from an Attic [[Black-figure pottery|black-figure]] cup (ca. 530&amp;ndash;520 BCE), a man makes an "up-and-down" gesture.]]

In the preface Dover writes that the aim of the work is: "To describe those phenomena of homosexual behaviour and sentiment which are to be found in Greek art and literature between the eighth and second centuries B.C., and so to provide a basis for more detailed and specialised exploration (which I leave to others) of the sexual aspects of Greek art, society and morality."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=fstPVlTPBRQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Greek+Homosexuality+kenneth+dover&amp;hl=fi&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gnVFVPmWO8G9ygO8xICAAw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Greek%20Homosexuality%20kenneth%20dover&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; In the Preface he furthermore argued that ‘heterosexual’ and ‘homosexual’ were not antithetical terms, but that homosexuality was a sub-division of the ‘quasi-sexual’ or ‘pseudo-sexual’.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

The conclusions drawn are that the Greeks regarded homosexuality in general to be natural, normal, and salutary, and their actual practices were circumscribed by cultural norms. In the case of the ancient Greeks &amp;ndash; specifically the [[Athens|Athenians]] &amp;ndash; the book claims that the sexual roles of the lovers were sharply polarized.

Dover concludes that the Greeks conceived of same-sex relations primarily as [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|intergenerational]] and identifies the terms for the roles of the two male lovers, ''[[Pederasty in ancient Greece#Terminology|erastes]], "the lover,"'' that is, the older active partner, and ''[[eromenos]], "the beloved",'' indicating the adolescent male beloved. Basing himself on the work of Sir&amp;nbsp;[[John Beazley]], Dover divides the evidence of surviving vase painting depicting these type of relationships into three types. Some show the ''erastes'' offering a gift to the ''eromenos''. Others depict the "up and down" gesture &amp;ndash; the ''erastes'' attempting to fondle the ''eromenos'' while, with the other hand, he is turning his head to look into his eyes. The third group, usually older black-figure vases, show the couple engaging in [[interfemoral intercourse]] or, in a couple of instances, [[Anal sex|anal intercourse]]. Traditionally, the young beloved, when he reached the age of manhood &amp;ndash; indicated in the iconography by his growth of a beard &amp;ndash; would switch roles and become a lover himself, seeking out a younger male for a love relationship. Later in life he was expected to marry and produce new citizens for the state.

To fail to switch roles was considered unmanly and irresponsible, and Dover points out the mockery that [[Aristophanes]] (a very popular and successful Athenian comic playwright) inflicted in passing, in several plays, on a certain Athenian citizen who was notorious for his persistence in the role of beloved long after reaching his maturity.

With regard to the record of cases in the law courts, Dover concentrates primarily on a certain case initiated by the orator [[Demosthenes]]. Demosthenes had been in an embassy sent to the neighboring state of Macedonia which had not only failed to achieve its mission, but was widely suspected of having accepted bribes from king [[Philip II of Macedon|Phillip]] to abandon their mission. Upon the return to Athens, Demosthenes initiated a prosecution of his fellow ambassadors for bribery in an attempt to avoid being indicted himself. The defendants successfully had the charges dismissed on the grounds that one of Demosthenes' co-plaintiffs, [[Timarchos]], had been a boy prostitute and had thereby lost his rights as an Athenian citizen, becoming ineligible to bring suit in Athenian courts.

Dover extensively quotes from the records of the trial to demonstrate, among other things, that while the Athenians attached no stigma to same sex relations ''per se'', they did adhere to certain conventions; in this case, that no citizen could be permitted to sell his sexual favors, which they regarded as the proper function of a slave, not a free man.

==Reception==
''Greek Homosexuality'' received some negative reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Halperin, David M. |title=One Hundred Years of Homosexuality: And Other Essays on Greek Love |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1990 |page=5 |isbn=0-415-90097-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the book had an enormous impact on the study of homosexuality in ancient Greece, partly because of Dover's credentials as an historian and a philologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Halperin, David M. |title=One Hundred Years of Homosexuality: And Other Essays on Greek Love |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1990 |page=4 |isbn=0-415-90097-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It influenced scholars such as the philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], and the classicists [[David M.

Halperin called Dover's work "the first modern scholarly study" of its subject and "a triumph of empirical research", and identified it as one of the key intellectual influences on his ''[[One Hundred Years of Homosexuality]]'' (1990). Halperin argued that the publication of Dover's work in 1978, together with the appearance of the English translation of Foucault's ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', marked the beginning of a new era in the study of the history of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Halperin, David M. |title=One Hundred Years of Homosexuality: And Other Essays on Greek Love |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1990 |pages=x, 4, 5 |isbn=0-415-90097-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Camille Paglia]] disputed Halperin's characterization of Dover's work, observing that while it was a valuable book on [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Greek pederasty]], it was not an "intellectual" work and aside from Dover's discussion of intercrural copulation contained relatively little that was surprising.&lt;ref name="Paglia"&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sex, Art, and American Culture: Essays |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |year=1992 |pages=172–173 |isbn=0-14-017209-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dover commented in his memoir that while he understood what Scruton meant when he called his work "trivialising", he was not abashed, since he attached importance to phenomena Scruton ignores.&lt;ref name="Dover"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dover, Kenneth |title=Marginal Comment: A Memoir |publisher=Duckworth |location=London |year=1995 |page=115 |isbn=0-7156-2630-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantarella has criticized some of Dover's conclusions, concluding that there was no restriction on anal intercourse in pederastic relationships, a claim rejected by the classicist [[Bruce Thornton]]. David Cohen has critically discussed Dover's work in ''Law, Sexuality and Society'' (1991), as has Thornton in ''Eros: The Myth of Ancient Greek Sexuality'' (1997).&lt;ref name="Thornton" /&gt; The philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] described ''Greek Homosexuality'' as the "best historical account of Greek sexual customs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nussbaum, Martha |editor1=Estlund, David M. |editor2=Nussbaum, Martha C. |title=Sex, Preference, and Family: Essays on Law and Nature |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1997 |page=39 |isbn=0-19-509894-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Greek Homosexuality'' was republished in a third edition, containing a foreword by Mark Masterson and James Robson discussing the book and its influence, in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://classicsforall.org.uk/book-reviews/greek-homosexuality/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Diablada]]''' or '''Danza de Diablos''' ({{lang-en|Dance of Devils}}) is a  [[dance]] created characterized by the mask and devil suit worn by the dancers.&lt;ref name="DRAE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=diablada |title=Diccionario de la Lengua Española - Vigésima segunda edición |author=Real Academia Española   |authorlink=Real Academia Española |year= 2001 |location=Madrid, Spain |language=Spanish |trans-title=Spanish Language Dictionary - 22nd edition |accessdate=30 November 2009 |quote=''Danza típica de la región de Oruro, en Bolivia, llamada así por la careta y el traje de diablo que usan los bailarines'' (Typical dance from the region of [[Oruro Department|Oruro]], in [[Bolivia]], called that way by the mask and devil suit worn by the dancers).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the ''Diablada'' is a matter of dispute between the countries of Bolivia and Peru.&lt;ref name="WLSspat"&gt;{{cite news |title=In This Spat Between Bolivia and Peru, The Details Are in the Devils|author=Moffett, Matt   |author2=Kozak, Robert |authorlink2=Robert Kozak|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125081309502848049|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=21 August 2009|page=A1|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three main locations exist for the possible origin of the dance. These places are:

*Oruro, Bolivia: Its earliest record found in pre-Hispanic times, the dance of "[[Llama llama]]"in worship of the [[Uros|Uru]] god [[Tiw (god)|Tiw]], dance subsequent ironically devoted Aymara language of the [[Uru people|Urus]] dance dressed as devils, as recorded by [[Ludovico Bertonio]]. Ethnohistorical development process of disguise and the dance of Diablada fall into three periods, according to the document sent of [[Carnaval de Oruro]] to Organization of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[Unesco]]) proclaimed as one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]: Periods of 1606 to 1789, 1789 to 1944 y 1944 to 1960.
*Juli, Peru: The ''Diablada'' would have been introduced in 1576 to the native [[Lupaka]]s people of [[Juli District|Juli]], located near [[Lake Titicaca]] in the Altiplano of present-day [[Puno Region|Puno]], Peru; and from there it allegedly spread to other parts of the Spanish domain in the Americas.&lt;ref name="Manzana"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Morales Serruto |first=José |title=La diablada, manzana de la discordia en el altiplano &lt;nowiki&gt;[The ''Diablada'', the bone of contention in the Altiplano]&lt;/nowiki&gt; |url=http://www.correoperu.com.pe/correo/nota.php?txtEdi_id=18&amp;txtSecci_id=72&amp;txtSecci_parent=&amp;txtNota_id=106612 |language=Spanish |publisher=[[Correo (Puno)|Correo]] |location=Puno, Peru |date=3 August 2009 |accessdate=27 September 2009 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the denomination==
The name was consolidated in a historical process of acceptance of the "Dance of devils" Native-Miners to the whole society of [[Oruro Department|Oruro]], this process covers the period from '''1789''' to '''1944''' where groups of "parades of devils" be called "[[Diablada]]." Finally in 1904 created the primeval "[[Diablada]]" with the label "[[The Great Traditional Authentic Diablada Oruro]]", with music, dress, choreography and plot defined. This period culminated with the founding of new groups of Diabladas in '''1944''', consolidating the denomination. Currently this definition is in the dictionary of the [[Spanish Royal Academy of Language]].

==Origin of the dance==
[[File:tio wari supay oruro.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Diablada de Oruro.|[[Wari (Uru god)|Wari]], [[Uros|Urus]] god who survived the onslaught of Aymara, Quechua and Spanish, is the "'''Uncle of mine'''" (Tiw), the last incarnation of the old Wari in [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]], [[Bolivia]]|200px]]

Its earliest record found in pre-Hispanic times, the dance of "[[Llama llama]]" dance subsequent ironically devoted Aymara language of the Urus dance dressed as devils, as recorded by [[Ludovico Bertonio]].

With the arrival of the Spanish in this region in '''1535''' and the Augustinians in '''1559''' with the [[Virgin of Candelaria]], it begins to produce an acculturation of religions and cultures.

Ethnohistorical development process of disguise and the dance of [[Diablada]] fall into three periods, according to the document sent of [[Carnaval de Oruro]] to Organization of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[Unesco]]).
*'''1606 to 1789:''' Historical period the founding of the Villa de San Felipe de Austria by Mr. Manuel de Castro Castillo and Padilla in a space called Uru Uru (Hururu now Oruro), which survives in part the cult of Imps ( name called) to "uncle" of mine that is slowly becoming a cult mixed to "Virgin of Socavón ([[Virgin of Candelaria]]) - Uncle of mine ([[Wari (Uru god)|Wari]])."
*'''1789 to 1944:''' Officially the image of the Virgin would be enthroned as from the date his image venerated by miners would be dressed as devils, including the archangel San Miguel. By 1818 the cure Montealegre Unveils "'''The Story of the Diablada'''", in 1891 finally ends the construction of the chapel of the Tunnel. And by 1904 was born the primeval "[[Diablada]]" with the tagline of "The Great Traditional Authentic Diablada Oruro." Diablada starting to travel inside and outside the country  since '''1915''' to show its spectacular choreography, music and costume.
*'''1944 to 1960:''' During this period Diabladas form new groups in 1944 such as: ''Artistic and cultural fraternity the "Diablada"'', in June of that year the ''Traditional set Folk "Diablada Oruro"'' then the ''"Circle of Arts and Letters."'' In 1956 he founded the ''"Diablada Railway"'' and finally in 1960 the ''"Artistic Diablada Urus".'' Diabladas also travel inside and outside the country showing the rich culture of Oruro, resulting in the founding of similar groups in other geographies of the continent.

==Native American roots==
[[File:Carnaval de Oruro dia I (61).JPG|thumb|left|alt=A Diablada dancer in Oruro.|''Diablada'' dancer during the [[Carnaval de Oruro|Oruro Carnival]] in [[Bolivia]].]]
The debate about the patrimonial identity of the ''Diablada'' concerns its roots as well. Chilean and Peruvian organizations suggest that since this dance is inspired in the Andean civilizations previous to the formation of the current national borders, it should belong equally to the three nations and other [[Andean states]] such as [[Argentina]] and [[Ecuador]] as well. Bolivian cultural organizations and government label this as an "unlawful cultural heritage appropriation" and consider that the declaration of the ''[[Carnaval de Oruro]]'' as one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] gives Bolivia and the city of Oruro support on this claim.&lt;ref name="LaPrensa140809"&gt;{{cite news |title=Perú dice que la diablada no es exclusiva de Bolivia |url=http://www.laprensa.com.bo/noticias/14-08-09/noticias.php?nota=14_08_09_alfi5.php |date=14 August 2009 |newspaper=[[La Prensa (La Paz)|La Prensa]] |publisher=Editores Asociados S.A. |location=La Paz, Bolivia |accessdate=10 December 2009 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Peru says that the ''Diablada'' is not exclusive of Bolivia}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolivian scholars such as the professor of ethnomusicology and cultural heritage, Diego Echevers Tórrez, express that the ''Diablada'' is not the mere representation of the devils in a defined space, but constitutes the cultural heritage of the city of Oruro with specific actors and environment.&lt;ref name="DiablosDiabladas"&gt;[[#refDiablosDiabladas|Echevers Tórrez 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aymaran roots theory===
The scholars who defend the theory of [[Juli District|Juli]] ([[Peru]]) identify the roots of this dance with the [[Aymara people|Aymara]]n traditions of the [[Lupaka]]s. Based on the written accounts of 16th-century historian and writer [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]], the Lupaka natives of Juli in the year 1576 presented their version of the ''Autos Sacramentales'' taught to them by Spanish Jesuit priests.&lt;ref name="Manzana"/&gt; According to the director of the cultural group ''Yuyachkani'' of Peru, Miguel Rubio Zapata, the dance holds Native American roots from the cult of [[Anchanchu]], a pre-Hispanic [[Aymara people|Aymara]] deity. Furthermore, rearchers Peter McFarren, Sixto Choque, and Teresa Gisbert state that the ''Diablada'' has roots to the Aymaran narrative of the ''Myth of the Supaya''.&lt;ref name="McFarrenChoqueGisbert"&gt;{{cite book |author1=McFarren, Peter   |author2=Choque, Sixto |author3=Gisbert, Teresa |editor1-first=Peter |editor1-last=McFarren |title=Máscaras de los Andes bolivianos |trans-title=Masks of the Bolivian Andes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3LOnU0zgugC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=24 October 2009 |year=2009 |origyear=1993 |publisher=Editorial Quipus |location=Indiana, United States |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uru roots theory===
[[File:Fiesta de los Collasuyos.jpg|thumb|alt=Ancient drawing of the festivity of Ito.|Depiction of the party of the [[Collasuyu]]s during the [[Ito festival]] presented in the 17th century book ''[[Primer Nueva Corónica y Buen Gobierno]]'' of [[Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala]].]]
After the declaration of the ''Carnaval de Oruro'' as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on 18 May 2001, the [[UNESCO]] delegated their ex-ambassador in Bolivia, Ivés de la Goublaye de Menorval, the task to be the moderator of the project and handed a form to the Bolivian authorities to be filled in coordination with historians and folklorists, such as Ramiro Condarco Morales, Mario Montaño Aragón, Fernando Cajías, Alberto Guerra Gutiérrez, Javier Romero, Elías Delgado, Carlos Condarco Santillán, Marcelo Lara, Zenobio Calizaya, Zulma Yugar, Walter Zambrana and Ascanio Nava.

The document elaborated by this group is based in the theory that the modern ''Diablada'' has roots in the ancient rituals performed 2000 years ago by the [[Uros|Uru civilization]]. The study makes reference to a deity named [[Tiw (god)|Tiw]] who was the protector of the Urus in mines, lakes and rivers and, in the case of Oruro (or ''Uru-uru''), the owner of caves and rocky shelters. The Urus worship this deity with the ''dance of the devils'' being the ''Tiw'' himself the main character, later this name was hispanicized as ''Tío'' ({{lang-en|uncle}}), and as product of the [[syncretism]], the ''Tiw'' represented the figure of the [[devil]] regretting and becoming devotee of the [[Virgin of Socavón]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refUNESCOform|A.C.F.O. 2001]], p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the times of the [[Tahuantinsuyu]], the four administrative entities known as ''[[Inca Government#Organization of the empire|suyus]]'' had their own representative dances during the [[Ito festival]], a festivity once celebrated throughout the entire empire but, according to the historian José Mansilla Vázquez, who based on manuscripts of [[Fray Martín de Murúa]], says that these festivities were outlawed during the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] with the exception of [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]] which, for being considered an important miner city in the 16th century, counted with some privileges  and the Spanish authorities looked to the other way allowing this festivity persist in this city, adapting itself later into the Spanish traditions between the ''[[Carnestolendas]]'' and the ''[[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]'' becoming into the Carnaval of Oruro over the centuries.&lt;ref name="UNESCOformPP10-17"&gt;[[#refUNESCOform|A.C.F.O. 2001]], pp.10-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oruro-mapa de la mitologia Uru.svg|thumb|left|alt=AMap of the sacred placed for the Urus.|Map of the sacred places in the city of [[Oruro, Bolivia]] showing the location of the [[ant]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[toad]]s and [[snake]]s, animals considered sacred in the [[Uru mythology]].]]
The ancient authors, Fray Martín de Murúa and [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]] make reference in their works to the different dances of the area, including the dance of the ''[[Llama llama]]'', name given by the [[Aymara people|Aymara]]s to refer to the [[Uros|Urus]] dressed as dancing demons, as it was recorded by [[Ludovico Bertonio]]. This dance was performed during the Ito festivities by the representatives of the region known as [[Urucolla]], a sub-region of the south-eastern ''suyu'' of [[Collasuyu]] located in the lake system of the [[Department of Oruro]] between the basins of the lakes [[Poopó Lake|Poopó]] and [[Coipasa lake|Coipasa]], where the Uru civilization had the city of Oruro as their main social centre, becoming together with [[Nazca]] and [[Wari ruins|Wari]] one of the most ancient cities in the [[Andes|Andean world]].&lt;ref name="UNESCOformPP10-17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGuamanPoma1615|Guaman Poma de Ayala 1615]], p.235.&lt;/ref&gt;

The supporters of this theory consider that the [[Uru mythology]] is reflected in the symbolism of the ''Diablada''. The legend behind the importance of the city of Oruro as an ancient sacred place for the Urus tells the story of the [[chthonic]] deity [[Wari (Uru god)|Wari]], which in the [[Uru language]] means ''soul'' ({{lang-ure|hahuari}}). He, after hearing that the Urus were worshiping [[Pacha Kamaq|Pachacamaj]], represented by [[Inti]], unleashed his revenge by sending plagues of [[ant]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[toad]]s and [[snake]]s, animals considered sacred in the Uru mythology. But they were protected by the [[Ñusta]] who adopted the figure of a [[condor]], defeating the creatures petrifying them and becoming sacred hills in the four cardinal points of the city of Oruro;  these animals are also often represented in the traditional masks of the ''Diablada''.&lt;ref name="MineTiw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islabahia.com/arenaycal/2009/156_enero/javier_claure_156.asp |title=El Tío de la mina |author=Claure Covarrubias, Javier   |date=January 2009 |publisher=Arena y Cal, revista literaria y cultural divulgativa |location=Stockholm, Sweden |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Uncle of the mine |accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UruMyth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.micarnaval.net/mitologia.htm |title=Mitología andina de los urus |author=Ríos, Edwin |year=2009 |publisher=[http://www.micarnaval.net MiCarnaval.net] |location=Oruro, Bolivia |language=Spanish |trans-title=Andean mythology of the Urus |accessdate=13 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091224155130/http://www.micarnaval.net/mitologia.htm |archivedate=24 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DiabladaOrigOruro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.micarnaval.net/origen_diablada.htm |title=La Diablada originada en Oruro - Bolivia |author=Ríos, Edwin |year=2009 |publisher=[http://www.micarnaval.net MiCarnaval.net] |location=Oruro, Bolivia |language=Spanish |trans-title=The ''Diablada'' originated in Oruro - Bolivia |accessdate=13 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815145701/http://www.micarnaval.net/origen_diablada.htm |archivedate=15 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish influence==
One of the most referenced studies about the ''Diablada'' is the 1961 book of [[Julia Elena Fortún]], ''La danza de los diablos'' (The dance of the devils), in which the theory of a relationship between this dance and a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] dance named ''[[Ball de diables]]'', was suggested; more specifically with the elements used in the localities of [[Penedès]] and [[Tarragona]].&lt;ref name="FortunP23"&gt;[[#refFortun1961|Fortún 1961]], p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RiusIMercade"&gt;[[#refRiusIMercade|Rius I Mercade 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Julia Elena Fortún, unlike other historians in the Peruvian side, disagrees with the idea of considering the ''Diablada'' as a product of the introduction of the [[autos sacramentales]] in the Andes, because among the ones studied by her, the thematic of the devil and his temptations was not contemplated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFortun1961|Fortún 1961]], p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Autos sacramentales'' Theory===

In 2003, the newspaper [[Correo (Puno)|Correo]] and José Morales Serruto, coordinator of cultural activities of the ''Asociación Nativa Puno'' (Native Association Puno), suggested that the dance of the ''Diablada'' was originated in the Peruvian city of [[Juli, Peru|Juli]] during a representation of the [[autos sacramentales]] in the year 1576 to the [[Aymara people|Aymara]]n kingdom of the [[Lupaca]]s.&lt;ref name="Manzana" /&gt;

Historian [[Mercedes Serna]] observes that as soon as the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]] was achieved, there was a sudden increase in the amount of [[Autos Sacramentales]] presented in the Spanish colonies. [[Jose Miguel Oviedo]] records that by the year 1560 contests were held for religious theatrical presentations.&lt;ref name="Garcilaso"&gt;{{cite book |author=De la Vega, Garcilaso   |authorlink=Inca Garcilaso de la Vega |author2=Serna, Mercedes |title=Comentarios Reales |trans-title=Royal Commentaries |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hro5nwgWxvoC&amp;vq=suli&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |edition=2000 |series=Clásicos Castalia |volume=252 |year=2000 |origyear=1617 |publisher=Editorial Castalia |location=Madrid, Spain |language=Spanish |isbn= 84-7039-855-5 |oclc= 46420337 |pages=226–227 |trans-chapter= |chapter=XXVIII |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=hro5nwgWxvoC&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;vq=Sulli&amp;dq=isbn%3A8470398555&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PA224#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This representation was documented in the 17th century book ''Comentarios Reales'' of [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]] where it reads:&lt;ref name="Garcilaso"/&gt;

Garcilaso de la Vega further mentions that the Jesuit priests taught the ''Auto Sacramental'' comedy by writing it in Aymara, and the natives of Juli later presented their version of the religious dance to the priests and, later, presented a dialogue to the rest of the Spanish population in such a way that it “changed the opinion that up to that point had regarded the natives as being dumb, rude, or incapable.”&lt;ref name="Garcilaso"/&gt;

This same information is used by other authors, such as the Peruvian scholar [[Nicomedes Santa Cruz]] and the Bolivian anthropologist Freddy Arancibia Andrade, to suggest that the Spanish influence was spread to Oruro from the southern Bolivian region of [[Potosí Department|Potosí]]. Andrade considers that the ''Diablada'' recovers the steps of rebellion and combat of the ritual of [[Tinku]] mixed with the biblic vision introduced by the Spanish conquerors in the miner region of [[Aullagas]] starting in the year 1538.&lt;ref name="ArancibiaAndrade"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Arancibia Andrade |first=Freddy |title=Investigador afirma que la diablada surgió en Potosí &lt;nowiki&gt;[Investigator affirms that the ''Diablada'' emerged in Potosí]&lt;/nowiki&gt; |url=http://www.la-razon.com/versiones/20090820_006825/nota_253_864270.htm |language=Spanish |location=La Paz, Bolivia |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=2 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904134937/http://www.la-razon.com/versiones/20090820_006825/nota_253_864270.htm |archivedate=4 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicomedes"&gt;[[#refSantaCruz2004|Santa Cruz, 2004]], p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another piece of information collected by Andrade is that in 1780 the army of [[Tomás Katari]] wore demon suits to attack the towns of Macha, Pocoata, Colquechaca, Aullagas and San Pedro de Buena Vista, giving more strength to the syncretism and represents the appearance of the tinku-devil. After the silver era in Bolivia, the miners went to  [[Uncía, Bolivia|Uncía]] to work for the tin company of [[Simón Iturri Patiño]] and during the [[Federal war (Bolivia)|Bolivian federal war]], the miners migrated to Oruro where in 1904 they were allowed to dance for the [[Virgin of Socavón]].&lt;ref name="ArancibiaAndrade" /&gt;

===''Ball de diables'' theory===
[[File:Correfoc13.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two dancers of Ball de diables carrying fireworks.|''[[Ball de diables]]'' during a [[Correfoc]] in [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]].]]
The ''Ball de diables'' has origins in a 12th-century [[entremés]] representing the struggle between the good and the evil where the figure of the [[Michael (archangel)|archangel Saint Michael]] and his angels battled the forces of evil represented by [[Lucifer]] and his demons. This act was performed in the wedding banquet of the [[Barcelona county|Barcelona count]], [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona|Ramón Berenguer IV]] with the [[Petronila of Aragón|princess Petronila]], daughter of the king of [[Aragón]] and [[Catalonia]] in the year 1150.&lt;ref name="RiusIMercade" /&gt;

In a study presented in 2005 by the Catalan scholar Jordi Rius i Mercade, member of the ''Ball de Sant Miquel i Diables de la Riera'' (board of the ''Ball de diables'' in Spain) and editor in chief of the specialized magazine ''El Dragabales'' during the Symposium of the Catalan Discovery of America, states that the traditional dances and short plays performed during the celebration of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] in [[Spain]] were adopted by the [[Christian church]] to teach their doctrines to the native Americans; their festivities were readapted to the new calendar and their deities were redefined acquiring demoniac forms representing the evil fighting against the divine power. According to Rius i Mercade, the ''Ball de diables'' was the most suitable for this purpose. In this study, he identifies three Latin American dances that contain similar elements to the Catalan ''Ball de diables''; the ''Diablada'' of [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]], ''[[Baile de Diablos de Cobán]]'' in [[Guatemala]] and ''[[Danza de los diablicos de Túcume]]'' in [[Peru]].&lt;ref name="RiusIMercade" /&gt;

The ''Diablada'' of Oruro represents the tale of the struggle between the archangel Saint Michael and Lucifer, the she-devil [[China Supay]] and devils accompanying them. Ruis i Mercade suggests that this was a tale presented by the parish priest Ladislao Montealegre of the city of Oruro in 1818 inspired in the Catalan ''Ball de diables''.&lt;ref name="RiusIMercade" /&gt;

==Colonial history==
During the [[Spanish empire|colonial times]] in the region, from the 15th century till the first half of the 19th century, the ancient Andean beliefs were blended with the new Christian traditions. The traditions adopted new iconography and the celebrations adopted a new meaning during the [[Latin American wars of independence]].

===From the worship of the Sun to the Virgin of Candlemas===
[[File:Church of copacabana.jpg|thumb|alt=A photo of the church of Copacabana, Bolivia.|The church of [[Copacabana, Bolivia]] where the [[Virgin of Candelaria|Virgin of the Candlemas]] was selected as patroness of the city and her cult spread across the region.]]
With the advent of the [[Religion in the Inca Empire|Inca state religion]] the inhabitants of the [[Isla del Sol|Island of the Sun]] ({{lang-es|Isla del Sol}}) were replaced by ministers in worship of the sun ([[Inti]]) and the city of [[Copacabana, Bolivia|Copacabana]] located in the Bolivian side of the [[Lake Titicaca]] had been repopulated by forty-two different nations of [[mitimae]]s and became one of the most important landmarks for the constant pilgrimage to the sanctuary; with the migration, two social classes were created in this area, the newcomers became ''[[Anansaya]]'' (upper) and the indigenous people ''[[Urinsaya]]'' (lower).&lt;ref name="Salles-ReesePP166-167"&gt;[[#refSalles-Reese1997|Salles-Reese 1997]], pp. 166-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The selection of the [[Virgin of Candelaria|Virgin of the Candlemas]] as the patroness of Copacabana was a sign of the power structures established by the Incas in the area. In the year 1582 a frost threatened to destroy the crops, and the inhabitants decided to build an altar to a Christian figure, but there was a dispute because the ''Anansayas'' insisted to use the Virgin of the Candlemas since [[Francisco Tito Yupanqui]] had already sculpted her image while the ''Urinsayas'' wanted it use the image of [[Saint Bartholomew]] instead. But the ''Anansayas''' wishes were imposed in the enthronement of the [[Virgin of Copacabana]] and the foundation of a brotherhood.&lt;ref name="Salles-ReesePP166-167" /&gt;

===Independence and the transition to the Carnival===
[[File:Oruro carnival artifacts.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Three Diablada masks.|Different models of ''Diablada'' masks in an exhibition in the [[British Museum]].]]
The cult of the Virgin of the Candlemas, was then spread throughout the Andes reaching, [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]] and to the west to [[Puno]]. In Oruro there is a Sanctuary in honour of the [[Virgin of Socavón]] (or Sanctuary of the Virgin of the Mineshaft) who was originally the Virgin of Candlemas traditionally honoured on 2 February, like in Puno,  but later the date was moved to [[Carnival]]; this transition is product of the [[Bolivian War of Independence]].
&lt;ref name="HarrisPP205-211"&gt;[[#refHarris2003|Harris 2003]], pp. 205-211.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a legend that says that on the Saturday of Carnival in 1789 a bandit known as ''Nina-Nina'' or ''Chiru-Chiru'' was mortally wounded in a street fight and before dying he was confronted by the Virgin of the Candlemas. Some versions state that he used to worship a life-size image of the Virgin painted in a wall of a deserted house, some say that the painting miraculously appeared on the wall of the bandit's own house after his death. And the legend is concluded with the tale of the troupe of devils dancing in honour of the Virgin in the next year's Carnival. The present sanctuary in Oruro was completed in 1891.&lt;ref name="HarrisPP205-211" /&gt;

However, according to the Ph D in religious studies and Executive Director of the Wisconsin Humanities Council at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Max Harris, this legend is related to a historical reality. During the [[Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II]],  which started in [[Cusco]] and spread along the Andean highlands, Oruro experienced a brief but bloody revolution as well. Pushed by the fear of being target of the indigenous revolution, the majority [[Creole people|Creole]] on the night of Saturday, 10 February 1781, attacked the minority ruling class of the peninsular-born Spaniards ({{lang-es|chapetones}}) . With the arrival of the Indigenous army the Creoles made an alliance.&lt;ref name="HarrisPP205-211" /&gt;

On 15 February, a messenger arrived in Oruro with orders from [[Túpac Amaru II]]. He instructed his army to respect churches and clergy, to do no harm to Creoles, and to prosecute none but ''chapetones''. And assured the victory by entering in [[La Paz]] "by Carnival (''por Carnestolendas'')", the Indigenous occupation of Oruro started to retreat leaving several thousands of deaths. But during March and April they launched more attacks to the city this time against the Creoles and the remaining Spaniards who unified forces to repel them.&lt;ref name="HarrisPP205-211" /&gt;

Harris observes that the Carnival of the year of 1781, fell on 24 February, placing Oruro's occupation exactly halfway between ''Candlemas'' and Carnival, making the situation in Oruro in Harris' words, "carnivalesque". Religious processions duelled with secular parades. Europeans and Creoles disguised as Indigenous, cases like a Spaniard resorting to cross-dressing tin a vain attempt to save his life and thousands of armed men in the streets of the colonial city. By 19 February people in the city regardless of the conflict continued celebrating and, throughout Carnival, the city markets were full of robbers selling the looted gold and silver back to its owners or to ''cholos'' and mestizos. By 1784 it was customary to rejoice, dance, play, and form ''comparsas'' (companies of masqueraders) for the Carnival in Oruro.&lt;ref name="HarrisPP205-211" /&gt;

Harris considers that with this background is that the legend of the Virgin of the Mineshaft in 1789 appeared favouring the rebellion as they worshiped the Virgin of Candlemas while the ''chapetones'' used to worship the [[Our Lady of the Rosary|Virgin of the Rosary]]. Under the beliefs of the revolutionaries, the Virgin of the Socavón tolerated the indigenous deities or ''devils'' and, according to Harris, if the legend is correct, by 1790, Oruro's miners had moved Candlemas to Carnival and added indigenous gods, masked as Christian devils, to the festivities.&lt;ref name="HarrisPP205-211" /&gt;

In 1818, Oruro's parish priest, Ladislao Montealegre, wrote the play ''Narrative of the seven deadly sins'', where according to Harris and Fortún, borrowed elements of the Catalan ''[[Ball de diables]]'' like the female devil, ''Diablesa'' in the Catalan dance and ''China supay'' in the Diablada and where the Devil leads the Seven Deadly Sins into battle against the opposing Virtues and an angel. Harris suggests that Montealegre may have wanted to represent the threat of rebellion and the historical context with this play.&lt;ref name="HarrisPP205-211" /&gt;

A generation later, in 1825 after Bolivia achieved its independence, the ''Diablada'' and the Carnival adopted a new meaning for Oruro's residents. Two of the ''Diablada'' dance squads and the street from where the parade starts are named after [[Sebastian Pagador]], one of the Creole heroes of the uprising. And the main square which is in the route of the Carnival to the Virgin of the Mineshaft temple is named ''Plaza 10 de febrero'' (10 February square) remembering the date of the uprising.&lt;ref name="HarrisPP205-211" /&gt;

''''Abd ar-Rahman ibn al-Qasim al-'Utaqi''' (750–806) (132 [[Islamic calendar|AH]] – 191 AH ), better known as '''Ibn al-Qasim''' was a prominent early jurist in the [[Maliki]] school from [[Egypt]]. He was one of [[Imam Malik|Malik's]] main companions and had a tremendous influence in recording the positions of the school. Ibn al-Qasim was the source for [[Sahnun]] in his Mudawwana, a record of Malik's teachings. He has the same position in the Maliki school as [[Muhammad al-Shaybani]] has in the [[Hanafi]] school, in so far as both of them transmitted their respective schools and made free use of [[ijtihad]] (independent reasoning). Ibn al-Qasim had opinions which differed from those of Malik, to the point that it was said that he was dominated by opinion.

==Life==
Ibn al-Qasim's full name was 'Abd ar-Rahman ibn ibn al-Qasim al-'Utaqi although he was well known as Ibn al-Qasim. He was born in Egypt in a mosque known as the 'Utaqi Mosque in the mid 8th century CE at a time when the Abbasids took control of the Muslim world from the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]]. Ibn al-Qasim's origins were from the Palestinian town of [[Ramla]]. He was a descendant from the slaves of [[Ta'if]] whom the Prophet Muhammad had freed. Ibn al-Qasim's father was in the [[Dewan]], and he used the money he inherited from him for his studies.

He travelled from Egypt to [[Medina]] after what is recorded as a visionary dream and after having been drawn to gatherings of religious knowledge in Egypt. In Medina, he met Malik as well as [[Ibn Wahb]], another of Malik's famous companions. Ibn al-Qasim kept the company of Malik for the relatively long period of about twenty years. It was from him that he learned his [[fiqh]] (jurisprudence). In Medina he also met [[Al-Layth ibn Sa'd|Al-Layth]], [[Ibn al-Majishun]] and Muslim ibn Khalid al-Zanji. Many people related from him and consulted him about Malik's fatwas. Ibn Wahb used to say, "If you want this business – meaning the fiqh of Malik – you must have Ibn al-Qasim. He is unique in it". His transmission of the [[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]] is considered to be the soundest transmission, and Sahnun learned the contents of the Mudawwana, the most comprehensive collection of Maliki fiqh, from him. Thus he can be considered as the main transmitter of Maliki fiqh, for the Mudawwana is its chief source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bewley.virtualave.net/ulama2.html+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk Excerpt from the section on Imam Malik in The Four Imams by Muhammad Abu Zahrah]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn al-Qasim was generally known for his vast knowledge. When Malik was asked about him and Ibn Wahb, he replied that Ibn Wahb was a knowledgeble man whilst Ibn al-Qasim was a true [[faqih]] (jurist).&lt;ref&gt;Qadi Iyad, ''Tartib al-Madarik'', Vol.3, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known as having ascetic qualities and spent much of his time reciting the Quran such that he would finish many readings in a short space of time. On his return to Egypt he refused to marry the daughters of wealthy officials and generally kept clear of the ruling class. He died in Egypt at the age of 63 in the month of [[Safar]], 191 AH (806 CE) three days after returning from a trip to Mecca. Ibn al-Qasim left behind him two sons Abd ar-Rahman and 'Umar.&lt;ref&gt;Qadi Iyad, ''Tartib al-Madarik'', Vol.3, p.260&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14950">The '''Industrious Revolution''' is the title given to a period of time, usually given as between 1600 and 1800&lt;ref name="Clark1998p841"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 841.&lt;/ref&gt; that led up to the [[Industrial Revolution]].  It is a term first coined by the Japanese demographic historian [[Akira Hayami]] &lt;small&gt;([[:ja:速水融|速水融]])&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;ref name="DeVries2008p78"&gt;De Vries (2008), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and accepted by other historians to help further explain the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Much of this theory deals with the spending behaviours of families in the period.  It also deals with the production and consumption of goods.  In fact, Industrious Revolutions are often characterized by a rise in demand for "market-supplied goods",&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p265"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; which will minimize the value of domestic goods, before the ultimate consumption. Industrious Revolutions often occur during a period where labour wages have stagnated or decreased.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p265" /&gt;  The theory of a pre-industrial Industrious Revolution is contested within the history community.

== Origin ==
Hayami introduced the concept of Industrious Revolution in a Japanese-language work published in 1967. It was coined to compare the labour-intensive technologies of Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868) with the capital-intensive technologies of Britain's Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Industrious Revolution: Consumer Behavior and the Household Economy, 1650 to the Present|last=de Vries|first=Jan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521895026|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayami observed that the two countries took different paths due to the different mix of factor endowments (capital for Britain and labour for Japan). He introduced Industrious Revolution to describe the Japanese developmental trajectory, which - lacking the British capital - exploited the benefits of increasing labour absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Resurgence of East Asia: 500, 150 and 50 Year Perspectives|last=Arrighi|first=Giovanni|last2=Hamashita|first2=Takeshi|last3=Selden|first3=Mark|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=978-0415316361|location=London|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Industrious vs. Industrial Revolution ==
This proposed Industrious Revolution does not aim to replace the [[Industrial Revolution]] in history; rather it is designed to supplement it.  By revamping the history of the period directly preceding the [[Industrial Revolution]], some historians hope to ensure that people get a better understanding of a particular aspect of the [[Early Modern Period]].
	
The basic picture painted of the pre-Industrial Revolution is that the [[Industrial Revolution]] was the result of a surplus of money and crops, which led to the development of new technology.  This new technology eventually developed into factories.  The Industrious Revolution addresses this belief, saying instead, that the overwhelming desire for more goods directly preceded the Industrial Revolution. The theory states that during the Industrious Revolution there was an increase in demand for goods, but that supply did not rise as quickly.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p255"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Eventually, some achievements of industry and agriculture, as well as the decisions made by households, helped to increase the supply, as well as the demand for goods. These behaviours, when combined constitute an Industrious Revolution.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p255" /&gt;  A quick summation of the differences between the Industrious Revolution and the [[Industrial Revolution]] is that the former is concerned with demand, and the latter is supply based.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p256"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; The right mindset to a productional economy and world may have increased the supply of technology, but they would have had little impact on invention without a demand for new techniques. 
	
The theory of an Industrious Revolution, as put forward by historian Jan de Vries, claims that there were two parts to the Industrious Revolution.  First, there was a reduction of leisure time as the utility of monetary income rose.  Second, the focus of labour shifted from goods and services to marketable goods.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p257"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some within the field of [[cultural history]] have theorized that a further motive for an industrious revolution is a shift in the view on what it takes for an individual to be considered independent.  Independence was equated with land ownership prior to an industrious revolution.  Wage earners were granted a degraded and dependent status.  Typically, as in the case of pre-industrial Great Britain and America, these dependent sorts were deemed unworthy of full citizenship rights.  Industrious revolutions shift the meaning of independence from land-holding to earning a competency.  A wage earner could now be considered independent if he/she earned enough money to support a household.  Hard work was viewed as essential for reaching this goal.

== Opposition ==
One of the suggested hallmarks of an Industrious Revolution is that of increased work days.  However, according to historians Gregory Clark and Ysbrand Van Der Werf, there has been no information found to suggest an increase in work days, in the time period between the [[Medieval]] Period and the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p839"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 839.&lt;/ref&gt; These records even indicate that before 1750, some people were working three hundred days per year.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p836"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 836.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even in the period preceding the [[Industrial Revolution]] people were working at least two hundred and ninety days in a year.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p837"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 837.&lt;/ref&gt;  So, this information would demonstrate that there was very little increase in days worked.  Since increase in work loads is one of the suggested hallmarks of an Industrious Revolution, this would work against the theory.
	
Clark and Van Der Werf have also examined the output of a couple of English industries.  For one, they looked at records of the saw mills in England.  Between 1300 and 1800, the period directly preceding and following the proposed Industrious Revolution, the estimated amount of lumber sawed increased about eighty percent.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p835"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 835.&lt;/ref&gt;    However, this increase in lumber sawed can be attributed to new technologies, and not in fact the influence of an Industrious Revolution.  In contrast, they mention the [[threshing]] industry.  Unlike the lumber sawing business, this industry shows “clear downward movement”&lt;ref name="Clark1998p834"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 834.&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[threshing]] rates, after which there are no longer any trends.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p834" /&gt; This information would help to disprove the idea of an Industrious Revolution, since, as it has been put forth, there is no universal trend displaying an increase of work habits.

In a later work, Hayami cited that de Vries and other theorists' interpretations did not use the term in the same way he does. Hayami noted that these saw Industrious Revolution and Industrial Revolution as a continuum while the original idea considers the two revolutions as opposing concepts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japan's Industrious Revolution: Economic and Social Transformations in the Early Modern Period|last=Hayami|first=Akira|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9784431551416|location=Tokyo|pages=95–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayami also stressed that the term explained how the Japanese became industrious for some reason at one point and that eventually they will no longer be.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Production of goods ==
Prior the proposed era of the Industrious Revolution most goods were produced either by household or by [[guilds]].&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p202"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; There were many households involved in the production of marketable goods.  Most of what was produced by these households were things that involved cloth- textiles, clothing, as well as art,&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p202" /&gt; and tapestries.&lt;ref name="Jardine1996p399"&gt;Jardine (1996), p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;  These would be produced by the households, or by their respective [[guilds]].  It was even possible for [[guilds]] and merchants to outsource into more rural areas, to get some of the work done. These merchants would bring the raw materials to the workers, who would then, using the supplied materials, make the goods.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p419"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006), p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, young girls would be hired to make silk, because they were the only people believed to have hands dexterous enough to make the silk properly.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p418"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006), p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other occupations such as knitting, a job that was never organized into guilds, could easily be done within the household.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The income of the household became dependent upon the quality and the quantity of everyone's work.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994"&gt;De Vries (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  Even if people were not working for an individual [[guild]] they could still supply and make items not controlled by the [[guilds]]. These would be small, but necessary items like wooden dishes, or soaps.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p205"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; So, basically, much of production was done by, or for, [[guilds]]. This would indicate that much of what was done was not done for one individual household, but for a larger group or organization. 

Prior to the Industrious Revolution, the household was the major site of production, and could be comparable to a factory. However, things were to change a bit during the Industrious Revolution.  If the theory is to be believed, then there was a shift in the running of the household.  The everyday goods and products used by the household would slowly shift from mostly homemade, to mostly "commercially produced goods".&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p262"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the women would be more than likely to be able to attain jobs outside of the household.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p261-62"&gt;De Vries (1994), pp. 261–62.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is also seen within the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], where women would often find small jobs to help supplement their husband's wages.&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  This would demonstrate the gradual movement away from the household as a centre of production.

==Patterns of consumption==
The patterns of consumption present in England at this time period were similar to what one might find in Europe, as well as in some of the Ottoman territories. This is unsurprising, however, since most of Europe and the Ottoman Empire were all connected through trade.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p252"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;  Through these trade connections, people were able to buy many of the luxury goods that they desired.  Very common amongst the nobility was the idea of [[Conspicuous consumption]].  This can be traced back, even into the [[Middle Ages]].  People, the nobility especially, had trade connections throughout Europe, and many of them would use these connections to buy the works of art, etc. that they desired.&lt;ref name="Jardine1996"&gt;Jardine (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;  This does not extend only to the rich however: even [[Medieval]] peasants enjoyed imported luxury items; there is evidence to suggest that some English peasants drank imported French wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Peasant |title=Medieval Lives |last=Jones |first=Terry |authorlink= |author2=Ereira, Alan |year=2005 |publisher=BBC Press |location=London |isbn=978-0-563-48793-7 |page=23 |chapter-url=}}{{Verify credibility|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People were consuming products well before the Industrious Revolution. There were stock exchanges all over Europe, even London.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006" /&gt; People were also clearly making products for consumption, as the large number of guilds existing within Europe at that point would suggest.  What would cause the period between 1600 and 1800 to be labeled an Industrious Revolution, by looking at the patterns of consumption, is the rise in demand for these products.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p255" /&gt; So, what would set this period in time apart would be more demands for luxury items.  Especially those items that could not be produced in the homes or by the [[guilds]].  During the proposed Industrious Revolution, this demand for luxury items would be greater than the supply could accommodate.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994" /&gt;  A rise in the rate at which people were consuming goods, especially when combined with other factors of the times, could have potentially heralded the Industrious Revolution.

'''Ion I. Nistor''' (August 16, 1876 – November 11, 1962) was a [[Romania]]n historian and politician. He was a [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]] after 1911, and served as administrator of its Library.

==Biography==
Nistor was born into a family of peasants in the Bivolărie hamlet of [[Vicovul de Sus]], [[Bukovina]] — in [[Austria-Hungary]] at the time, it is now included in [[Suceava County]], Romania. He studied at the local school in Vicovul de Sus, then at Elementary School of [[Rădăuţi]] and at the Rădăuţi [[German language|German]] High School, getting his ''[[Matura]]'' in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Neagoe, p. V&lt;/ref&gt;

He then studied Philosophy and Literature at the [[University of Czernowitz]] and between 1898 and 1900, he completed his military service in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] (serving in [[Pula|Polei]] and in [[Vienna]]), and graduated from the University in 1902, after which he was named teacher of history and geography at the Suceava Classic High school.&lt;ref&gt;Neagoe, p. V-VI&lt;/ref&gt; Together with some of his friends, Nistor edited a magazine titled ''Junimea Literară'' between 1904 and 1914, first published in Rădăuţi and then in Suceava.&lt;ref&gt;Neagoe, p. VI&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, Nistor married Virginia Pauliuc, daughter of the Gheorghe Pauliuc (a [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] priest from [[Burla, Suceava|Burla]]), and, one year later, on July 5, 1905, Oltea, his only child, was born.&lt;ref&gt;Neagoe, p. VII&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to teach at the Orthodox High School, making use of the institution's library, better suited to his studies into the history of [[Moldavia]].

In 1908-1909 and 1910–1911, he studied at the [[University of Vienna]] and completed his [[PhD]] under [[Konstantin Josef Jireček]], with a thesis on ''Moldavia's aspirations regarding [[Pokuttya]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Neagoe, p. VIII&lt;/ref&gt; After that, he furthered his studies at the Universities of [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich|Munich]], [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], receiving (1911) his ''[[Docent]]'' title and the ''[[Venia legendi]]'', which allowed him to teach at the University of Vienna, where he gave lectures on the [[History of Romania|history of the Romanians]].&lt;ref&gt;Neagoe, p. IX&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, in 1912, he moved to Czernowitz, to hold the chair of [[Southeastern Europe]]an history, but after the start of [[World War I]], he moved to the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]], where he published various studies on the history of Bukovina. He was elected a member of the Romanian Academy in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Neagoe, p. IX-XII&lt;/ref&gt; He also authored an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] map of Bukovina under [[Austria]]n domination (''see [[Cisleithania]]''), based on the census of 1910.

Living in [[Iaşi]] by the time Romania entered the war on the [[Allies of World War I|Entente side]], Nistor left Romania at the climax of the [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|Romanian Campaign]] (when troops of the [[Central Powers]] threatened the region). In July 1917, he moved to [[Odessa]], in territory held by the [[Russian Provisional Government]], and began teaching Romanian history to the (mostly [[Bessarabia]]n) students at the [[Odessa National University|University of Novorossiya]]. He interrupted the course in November 1917, after a group of armed [[October Revolution|Russian revolutionaries]] broke into the University building. Nistor was, however, safely escorted outside by some of the Bessarabian soldiers who were part of his audience.&lt;ref&gt;Nistor, in Neagoe, p. XIV&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1918, together with other Austro-Hungarian refugees (including [[Octavian Goga]]), Nistor departed for [[Ovidiopol]], [[Cetatea Albă]] and then finally reached [[Chişinău]]. He stayed in the city, where he argued for the founding of a Moldavian University, and soon began lecturing on the History of the Romanians. He used the data gathered from the Chişinău Archives to write the ''History of Bessarabia'', published in 1923. Nistor also witnessed the [[Sfatul Ţării]] session which voted the union with Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Nistor, in Neagoe, p. XIV-XV&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war ended, he returned to his native Bukovina and he was one of the members of the National Assembly of Bukovina in [[Chernivtsi|Cernăuţi]], which voted for the [[Union Day (Romania)|union with Romania]] on November 28, 1918. Nistor was also one of the fifteen Bukovinans who presented the Union Act to Romania's [[King of Romania|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]].&lt;ref&gt;Neagoe, p. XVI&lt;/ref&gt;

Nistor presided upon the [[Democratic Union Party (Bukovina)|Democratic Union Party]], which had a [[Centralized government|centralist]] agenda. Between December 18 and May 2, he was a member of [[Greater Romania]]'s [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]] government, as a Minister for Bukovina, and, between February 14 and February 27, also held the rank of minister for Bessarabia, while the nominal minister was delegated to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. Between May 1920 and January 1922, Nistor was a [[Senate of Romania|Senator]] in the [[Parliament of Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Neagoe, p. XVII&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[interwar period]], Nistor wrote many historical works, including ''The [[Origin of Romanians]] and the [[Vlachs]] of [[Thessalia]] and [[Epirus]]'' and ''The History of Romanians in [[Transnistria]]'' (1925). He was also the director of the historical magazine ''Codrii Cosminului'', which was published between 1924 and 1939.&lt;ref name="Neagoe, p.XVIII, XX"&gt;Neagoe, p. XVIII, XX&lt;/ref&gt;

Elected [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[Chernivtsi University|University of Cernăuţi]] in 1920, serving as such until 1921, and again from 1933 to 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Michelson, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1920, he joined the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL), and was again the Minister of State for Bukovina in the fourth Brătianu cabinet (1922–1926), Minister of Public Works in the fifth Brătianu cabinet (1927–1928), and Minister of Labour in the first [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]] cabinet (1934). In 1938, he broke with the PNL and sided with the [[National Renaissance Front]] regime established by King [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]], and was Minister of the Cults and Arts in the second Tătărescu cabinet (November 24, 1939–May 12, 1940).&lt;ref name="Neagoe, p.XVIII, XX"/&gt;

Starting October 1940, under the [[National Legionary State]], Nistor taught at the [[University of Bucharest]], becoming the target of [[Iron Guard]] persecutions for the support he had given to King Carol. Following the Guard's defeat during the [[Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom|Legionnaires' Rebellion]] of 1941, he sent a congratulatory telegram to ''[[Conducător]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Scurtu, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He was pensioned in the same year, and, starting 1943, he was in charge of Library of the Romanian Academy.&lt;ref name="Neagoe, p.XXXIV"&gt;Neagoe, p. XXXIV&lt;/ref&gt; Nistor kept the latter office until after the establishment of a [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]], when [[List of purged members of the Romanian Academy|the purge]] of [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]] in the Academy began (1948).&lt;ref name="Neagoe, p.XXXIV"/&gt;

His house was [[Nationalization|nationalized]], and Nistor had to live in the attic of his daughter's house (which was also nationalized). On the night of May 5/6, 1950, Nistor was arrested for political reasons by the [[Securitate]], being incarcerated in [[Sighet prison]]. Originally sentenced to 24 months in prison, his sentence was subsequently raised to 60 months.&lt;ref&gt;Sighet Memorial&lt;/ref&gt;

He was freed five years and two months later. After that, he continued writing, completing his works, ''History of Bukovina'' and ''The History of Romanians''.&lt;ref&gt;Nistor, in Neagoe, p. XXXV&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jan Morris''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature|FRSL]] (born 2 October 1926) is a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] historian, author and [[travel writer]]. She is known particularly for the ''Pax Britannica'' trilogy (1968–1978), a history of the [[British Empire]], and for portraits of cities, notably [[Oxford]], [[Venice]], [[Trieste]], Hong Kong, and New York City. A [[trans woman]], she was published under her birth name, James, until 1972, when she had sex reassignment after transitioning from living as male to living as female.

==Background==
Born in England of an [[English people|English]] mother and Welsh father, Morris was educated at [[Lancing College]], West Sussex, and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], and considers herself [[Welsh people|Welsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/02/jan-morris-life-in-motion | title=Jan Morris at 90: She has shown us the world | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date=March 27, 2016 | access-date=March 27, 2018 | last=Johns | first=Derek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the closing stages of the [[Second World War]] Morris served in the [[9th Queen's Royal Lancers]], and in 1945 was posted to the [[Free Territory of Trieste]], during the joint British-American occupation.

==Career==

After the war Morris wrote for ''[[The Times]]'', and in 1953 was its correspondent accompanying the [[1953 British Mount Everest Expedition|British Mount Everest Expedition]], which in the event was the first to scale [[Mount Everest]]. Morris reported the success of [[Edmund Hillary|Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay|Tenzing]] in a coded message to the newspaper, "Snow conditions bad stop advanced base abandoned yesterday stop awaiting improvement", and by happy coincidence the news was released on the morning of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]]'s coronation.&lt;ref name='venables'&gt;{{cite book|last=Venables|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Venables|title=To the top: the story of Everest|publisher=[[Walker Books]]|year=2003|location=London|pages=63|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=0-7445-8662-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporting from [[Cyprus]] on the [[Suez Crisis]] for ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' in 1956, Morris produced the first "irrefutable proof" of collusion between France and [[Israel]] in the invasion of [[Egypt]]ian territory, interviewing [[French Air Force]] pilots who confirmed that they had been in action in support of Israeli forces.&lt;ref name="rusbridger"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rusbridger|first=Alan|title=Courage Under Fire|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 July 2006|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jul/10/pressandpublishing.egypt|accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris opposed the [[Falklands War]].&lt;ref&gt;"Authors Take Sides on the Falklands (Review)", W. L. Webb, ''[[The Guardian Weekly]]'', August 29th, (p.21).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1949, Morris married Elizabeth Tuckniss, the daughter of a tea planter; they had five children together, including the poet and musician [[Twm Morys]]. One of their children died in infancy.

Morris began a sex change in 1964.&lt;ref name=conundrum&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Jan|title=Conundrum|publisher=[[New York Review of Books]]|year=2006|page=174|isbn=978-1-59017-189-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Morris travelled to [[Morocco]] to undergo [[sex reassignment surgery]], performed by surgeon [[Georges Burou]], because doctors in Britain refused to allow the procedure unless Morris and Tuckniss divorced, something Morris was not prepared to do at the time.&lt;ref name=conundrum/&gt; They divorced later, but remained together and on 14 May 2008 were legally reunited when they formally entered into a [[civil partnership]].&lt;ref name=mcsmith&gt;{{cite news|last=McSmith|first=Andy|title=Love story: Jan Morris – Divorce, the death of a child and a sex change... but still together|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=4 June 2008|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/love-story-divorce-the-death-of-a-child-and-a-sex-change-but-still-together-839602.html|accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Morris detailed her transition in ''Conundrum'' (1974), her first book under her new name, and one of the first [[autobiographies]] to discuss a personal gender reassignment. &lt;ref&gt;Shopland, Norena 'A tangle in my life' from Forbidden Lives: LGBT stories from Wales, Seren Books, 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;{{notetag|The opening lines of ''Conundrum'': "I was three or perhaps four years old when I realized that I had been born into the wrong body, and should really be a girl. I remember the moment well, and it is the earliest memory of my life."}}  

Morris lives mostly in north Wales.

==Awards==
Morris has received [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]]s from the [[University of Wales]] and the [[University of Glamorgan]], is an honorary fellow of Christ Church, Oxford, and is a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]]. She received the [[Glyndŵr Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to the Arts in Wales in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Wales Arts: Jan Morris|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/jan-morris/|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She accepted her [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the 1999 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] "out of polite respect", but is a [[Welsh nationalist]] republican at heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/profile/profile_jan_morris.shtml|title=Jan Morris:A Profile|last=Frost|first=Caroline|work=[[BBC Four]] website}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, she was awarded the [[Golden PEN Award]] by [[English PEN]] for "a Lifetime's Distinguished Service to Literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englishpen.org/prizes/golden-pen-award-for-a-lifetimes-distinguished-service-to-literature |title=Golden Pen Award, official website |publisher=[[English PEN]] |date= |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Traveling Genius: The Writing Life of Jan Morris |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wHMEVRxWx6UC&amp;pg=PR20 |author=Gillian Fenwick |publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press |chapter=Chronology |page=XX |year=2008 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, ''The Times'' named her the 15th greatest British writer since the War.&lt;ref name=mcsmith /&gt; She has featured in the Pinc List of leading Welsh LGBT figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pinc List 2017|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/pinc-list-2017-40-most-13462359|website=Wales Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won the 2018 [[Edward Stanford Outstanding Contribution to Travel Writing Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edwardstanfordawards.com/single-post/2018/02/01/Edward-Stanford-Travel-Writing-Awards-2018-winners |title=Edward Stanford Travel Writing Awards 2018 winners |publisher=Edward Stanford Travel Writing Awards |author= |date=February 1, 2018 |accessdate=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with BBC in 2016 she told [[Michael Palin]] that she does not like to be described as a travel writer, as her books are not about movement and journeys; they are about places and people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artsnight: Michael Palin Meets Jan Morris|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07zc1bv|website=BBC|publisher=BBC Two}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8924">'''Jean Meyer''' (born February 8, 1942 in [[Nice]]) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] historian and author of [[France|French]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldemexico/notas/n1850880.htm|title=El prefijo de moda|last=Fonseca|first=Francisco|date=November 11, 2010|work=El Sol de Mexico|language=Spanish|accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has published extensively on the [[Cristero War]] and on the [[caudillo]] [[Manuel Lozada]].

==Biography==
Jean Meyer obtained bachelor's and master's degrees at the [[Sorbonne University]]. He has taught at Sorbonne, [[Université de Perpignan|Perpignan]], the [[University of Paris]], the [[Colegio de México]], the [[Colegio de Michoacán]], and the [[Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas]]. He has done extensive research on the [[Cristero War]] and written books on the subject for the [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[Universidad de Guadalajara]]. He also founded the Institute of Mexican Studies at the [[University of Perpignan Via Domitia|University of Perpignan]] in [[France]].

His major publications deal with conservative peasants in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Mexico. His work on the Cristero War is crucial for the understanding of this major uprising in Mexico following the enforcement of the [[anticlerical]] articles of the [[1917 Constitution of Mexico]].  He has also published important works about [[Manuel Lozada]], a nineteenth-century regional leader in [[Nayarit]] who fought for the rights of mestizo and indigenous peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Meyer, ''Esperando a Lozada''. Guadalajara: El Colegio de Michoacan 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Meyer, ''La tierra de Manuel Lozada''. Mexico City:CEMCA 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Manuel Lozada" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, 763-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Eric Van Young reviewed Meyer's ''Esperando a Lozada'', saying "the major essays are beautifully written, talky, strongly rhetorical, slightly wistful in tone, and intensely romantic and hardheaded at one and the same time, as with much of the best French ''annaliste'' history."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Van Young, "To See Someone Not Seeing: Historical Studies of Peasants and Politics in Mexico." ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'' 6, no. 1 (1990): 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a recognized authority on the immediate post-revolutionary period in Mexico and was chosen to write the general article on Mexico in the 1920s for the ''Cambridge History of Latin America''.&lt;ref&gt;republished as "Revolution and Reconstruction in the 1920s" in ''Mexico Since Independence'', Leslie Bethell, ed. New York: Cambridge University Press 11991, pp. 201-240.&lt;/ref&gt;

His brother is the [[Abel Prize]]-winning mathematician [[Yves Meyer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1938">'''Jerzy Adam Brandhuber''' (23 October 1897 – 19 June 1981) was a Polish [[Painting|painter]] and a survivor of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].

Brandhuber was born in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]]. After having graduated with a degree in pictorial arts at the academy of Fine Arts in Kraków Jerzy Adam Brandhuber worked at a secondary school teaching arts before he was arrested by the Germans in 1942 for "helping the Jews". He was brought to the concentration camp of Auschwitz on 14 January 1943. Labeled with the inmate number 87112 he was assigned to work in the labor battalion distributing clothes. During an evacuation march out of the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] he was freed on 3 May 1945 and lived in [[Lübeck]] after that.

In 1947 Brandhuber started working as a [[historian]] at the National Museum Auschwitz-Birkenau. Due to the limited availability of housing in Poland he received an official residence at the memorial place in which he lived till death.

Jerzy Adam Brandhuber created a cycle of paintings called'' Forgotten Earth'' in 1946 which conveys his memoirs of Auschwitz. Towards the end of his life he concentrated mainly on nude life drawings, portraits and landscapes. He died in the city of [[Oświęcim]] (Polish name for Auschwitz).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4693">'''John Ulric Nef''' (1899&amp;ndash;1988) was an American [[economic history|economic historian]], and the co-founder of the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Committee on Social Thought]]. He was associated with the University of Chicago for over half a century, and co-founded the Committee there in 1941.

==Early life==
Nef was born in 1899. He was a native Chicagoan. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1920.&lt;ref name=p59&gt;Samuels (2005), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; He finished a PhD degree at the Robert Brookings Graduate School in [[Washington, D.C.]] (a precursor of the [[Brookings Institution]]) in 1927. He served at [[Swarthmore College]]'s faculty for a year. He joined the [[University of Chicago]]'s faculty in 1929 as an assistant professor of economics.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite news |title=John U. Nef, Economic Historian At Chicago University, Dies at 89 |author=Saxon, Wolfgang |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 27, 1988 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/27/obituaries/john-u-nef-economic-historian-at-chicago-university-dies-at-89.html |accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in academia==
After joining the faculty at Chicago in 1929, he was associated with the university for over half a century. He became professor of [[economic history]] there in 1936.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

He also served as a visiting professor at French universities, [[Institut d'études politiques]] and the [[Collège de France]], and also lectured at the universities of Belfast and Houston.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

===Committee on Social Thought===
In 1941 Nef co-founded the [[Committee on Social Thought]] at Chicago along with [[Frank Knight]], [[Robert Redfield]], and [[Robert M. Hutchins]] (who was then president of the University of Chicago).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=Clifford|title=Robert Redfield and the development of American anthropology|publisher=Lexington Books|date=August 28, 2006|pages=139|isbn=0-7391-1777-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yNncBMHoRooC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an elite interdisciplinary graduate department at Chicago. He served as executive secretary and also as chairman (1945&amp;ndash;1964) of the Committee. He brought a number of distinguished people he had encountered in his travels abroad such as [[Marc Chagall]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Jacques Maritain]] to the Committee.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

==Work as an economic historian==
Nef went on to become a foremost economic historian. His largest domain of interest was the [[Western Europe]]'s economic, cultural, and military history since the end of the 15th century. He was involved in the study of the comparative economic histories of Britain and France; his most intense being the [[Economic history of France|French economic history]]. His early work on the coal industry of Britain and the early [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain during the 16th and 17th century is particularly important. His work indicated that the Industrial Revolution was a long-time evolutionary process.&lt;ref name=p59/&gt; He was also one of the first economic historians who paid serious attention to technology.&lt;ref name=p60&gt;Samuels (2005), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
He was an author of a number of books which include Industry and Government In France and England 1540-1640 (1940), ''The United States and Civilization'' (1967), ''The Rise of the British Coal Industry'' (1966), ''The Conquest of the Material World'' (1964), and ''Search for Meaning: Autobiography of a Non-Conformist'' (1973).&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

==Later life==
Apart from being an economic historian, Nef was also an officer of the French Legion of Honor, a philanthropist, and patron of the arts.&lt;ref name=p60/&gt;

In 1979 the Society for the History of Technology awarded him the [[Leonardo da Vinci Medal]], and in 1980 he received the University of Chicago Medal.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; 

He died at his home in Washington, D.C. at the age of 89, after a long illness, in 1988.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

'''Monheim''' is a [[Town#Germany|town]] in the [[Donau-Ries]] district, in [[Bavaria]], Germany. It is situated 15&amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Donauwörth]], and 27&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Nördlingen]]. It lies in the [[Regierungsbezirk]] [[Schwaben]].

==History==
{{See also|History of Bavaria}}
The origins of Monheim date back into the 7th century, when a village was formed at the crossing of the Gailach, a small river running into the [[Altmühl]]. From 870, a [[Benedictian]] [[convent]] existed within the small town. In 893, the [[abbess]] of the convent, Mother Liubila, transferred it to the [[Bishopric of Eichstätt|Bishop of Eichstätt]], Erchanbald, and it was then that Monheim was first mentioned in an official document. It became an important place of [[pilgrimage]] due to the [[relics]] of [[Saint Walpurga]], a former abbess of the convent in [[Eichstätt]]. Unlike virtually all of Schwaben, which belongs to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Augsburg|Diocese of Augsburg]], Monheim is still part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Eichstätt|Diocese of Eichstätt]] today.

The village of Monheim came into possession of the ''Graf von [[Oettingen in Bayern|Oettingen]]'', now the [[House of Oettingen-Wallerstein]], around the year 1325. Monheim was awarded its [[town rights]] shortly after and the oldest [[Seal (device)|seal]] of the town dates from 1340. The seal from 1340 already shows the [[moon]], which is still part of the towns crest today. The name ''Monheim'' however does not derive from ''moon''. Until 1821, the crest's colors were red and silver, the colors of the House of Oettingen. Only after 1821 were the current blue and gold adopted.

The town was fortified, lying at the intersection of the important trade route from [[Augsburg]] to [[Nürnberg]], which is nowadays the [[Bundesstraße 2]], and the road from [[Nördlingen]] to [[Neuburg an der Donau]]. Some of this wall still remains today, including both gates.

The town remained a possession of Oettingen until the end of the ''[[Landshut]] war of succession'' in 1505. Monheim was then handed to the duchy [[Palatinate-Neuburg]] (German: ''Pfalz-Neuburg''), whom it remained with until 1808. The duke Heinrich introduced the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] to his lands and Monheim in 1530 and the convent in town was dissolved. Monheim lost its relics and with it much of its religious importance for the region. The convent building was taken down in 1574 but the large Saint Walpurga church, the current building dating from 1509, and some of the convents [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] courtyard, dating from the 12th century, remained. The courtyard was fully restored in 1977.

[[Martin Luther]] spent a night in Monheim, traveling back from an interrogation in 1518. A large plaque of this notable event remains at the location he stayed.

In 1614, the [[Prince-elector|Elector]] Wilhelm reintroduced [[Catholicism]] in Palatinate-Neuburg, including Monheim, but the convent was not restored. The Swedish army under the King of Sweden, [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav Adolf]], ransacked Monheim in 1632 during the [[Thirty Years' War]], an event the town took long to recover from.

From 1523 onwards, Monheim also became the seat of the [[county court]] (German:''Landgerichtssitz'') for the surrounding region and in 1650 a small palace (German:''Schloß'') was built for the duke's administrator.

The year 1697 saw the first arrival  of [[Jews]] in Monheim. In 1741, they had to leave the town again, under pressure from the authorities. The [[Monheim Town Hall|current town hall]] was built by a rich Jewish merchant, the [[Court Jew]] Abraham Elias Model, between 1714 and 1720. Model was the chief creditor for the ''Graf von Wallerstein'' at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd5Ce3gP9CMC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=Abraham+Elias+Model+&amp;source=web&amp;ots=-tCzhemM9v&amp;sig=PkiqW0yDl46YeISpldR__JKjyqQ&amp;hl=en The Court Jew - A Contribution to the History of the Period of Absolutism ] Google book review, Page 100 Author: Selma Stern, Published: Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; The upper floor of his house originally was thought to have served as the [[synagogue]] for the small Jewish community, a fact since disproved, and in 1978 and 1994 the original [[ceiling]]s, displaying motives from the [[Old Testament]], or [[Tanakh]], were fully restored. The fact that they were covered by a layer of gipsum, which had to be removed, saved them from almost certain destruction by the Nazis. The rooms now serve as the meeting hall for the town council.

The end of the [[War of Bavarian Succession]] in 1779 saw the reunification of Bavaria with Palatinate-Neuburg and Neuburg lost its status as a capital. Monheim was now Bavarian again.

Like most of Bavaria, the age of [[industrialisation]] bypassed Monheim and it remained predominantly agricultural. The two world wars saw great personal losses but no real destruction for the town.

During the Nazi era, Monheim saw its mayor, Josef Hofmann, replaced with local party leader Albert Königsdorfer. Some of the members of the local council were temporarily taken in "protective custody". Resistance to the Nazis was passive, at best. When the figurine of Saint Walpurga on the fountain of the market square was replaced by a more war-like motif in October 1937, the Catholic parish priest, Anton Geitner, an anti-Nazi, refused the Nazi salute and found himself heavily criticised.&lt;ref name="Krieg"&gt;{{de icon}} ''Monheim - Kleine Stadt mit grosser Vergangenheit'', Chapter: Monheim during the pre-war, war and post-war times, by: Theo Schmiedt, page: 157–170&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberation came to Monheim on 24 April 1945, with only limited amounts of fighting taking place. A number of houses in town were shelled and the white flag was raised in town by Matthias Schmied, mayor of Monheim from 1945 to 1947, who was quickly followed in his example by other citizens. In appreciation of the fact that the town survived the war with such little damage, the local town council degreed that a church service was to be held annually on the 24 April. Monheim experienced a short occupation of four days before the US soldiers left the town again.&lt;ref name="Krieg" /&gt;

The post-World War II years saw a growth in small industries in town. The county court was relocated from Monheim in 1957. The reorganisation of communities in Bavaria and Germany between 1972 and 1978 meant that Monheim came in charge of the previously independent surrounding villages, enlarging the town in size and population.

==Main sights==
* The ''Stadtpfarrkirche'', the catholic parish and convent church, dating from 1500
* The ''Kreuzgang'', the former convent courtyard, adjacent to the church, dating from the 12th century
* The ''[[Monheim Town Hall|Rathaus]]'', the town hall, former Jewish residence, dating from 1714, open to the public
* The two ''Stadttore'', the southern and northern gates of the town, dating from the 14th century

==Incorporated villages==
* Rehau
* Flotzheim
* Weilheim
* Wittesheim
* Warching
* Kölburg
* Itzing
* Ried

==Town council==
The towns [[mayor]] is Günther Pfefferer.

As of 2008, the town council (German:''Stadtrat'') consists of 16 elected members from the following parties:
* Independent, PWG and MUM: 7
* [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]], CSU: 6
* [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], SPD: 3

==Economy==
The town largely depends on light industry, with the [[Hama Photo|Hama]] company being one of the main employers, having relocated from [[Dresden]] to Monheim after the second world war.

[[Agriculture]] is still an important factor with about half of the surrounding land used for it.

==Road and rail connections==
Monheim lies on the ''Bundesstrasse 2'', the ''Federal Road No. 2''. The ''B2'' used to go straight through town until a bypass was built in the early 1990s. The road from Neuburg to Nördlingen, which passes through the outskirts of Monheim, is not a Federal road.

The nearest train line is nowadays in [[Fünfstetten]], the Augsburg–Nürnberg line. From there, a 5.6&amp;nbsp;km long&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.rund-um-die-eisenbahn.de/strecken/e-nby.htm Former railway lines in northern Bavaria]&lt;/ref&gt; side track used to run to Monheim, built in 1905–06, but passenger service was suspended in 1960 and goods services in the 1990s. During the 1980s, a historic train used to operate on the line on selected summer weekends. Footage of this train was used in the 1983 German movie ''Der Glockenkrieg''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eisenbahn-im-film.de/eif1.htm Eisenbahn im Film – Rail Movies] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

The train line has now been completely removed and only the railway station is still in place, now home to the local [[Domestic Pigeon|pigeon]] breeders club.

==Sport==
The local sports club, ''TSV Monheim'', has a strong tradition in [[artistic gymnastics]], being one of the centres of the sport in Germany. Its team competes at the highest national level of the sport, often attracting foreign athletes, especially from [[Brasil]]. In April 2008, the town hosted a four-nations under-18's tournament with Germany, France, the UK and Switzerland participating.

Warching, one of the neighboring villages, is home to a [[motocross]] track and club, the ''MV Warching'', formed in 1973. The club has a strong [[sidecarcross]] tradition, having had many of its members race at [[sidecarcross world championship|world championship]] level. Through Hubert Rebele and Alois Wenninger, the club archived four runners-up spots in this competition in the 1980s and 90's. The track was also the venue for the 1985 German sidecarcross Grand Prix, the only time it was held in Warching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejohndaveypages.org/JD_GP/JD_GP___Index.htm The John Davey Grand Prix Pages]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
Like many towns in Bavaria which preserved their old town centre, Monheim hosts a historical ''Town Festival'' (German:''Historisches Stadtfest''). Its staged every second year, being held next in July 2014.

[[Image:Gailachquelle Monheimer-Alb.jpg|thumb|right|[[Karst topography|Karst]] spring of the Gailach at Mühlheim]]

==''Hortulus Monheimensis''==
'Hortulus Monheimensis' is a [[florilegium]] of watercolour sketches commissioned in 1615 by Wolfgang Philippus Brandt, the local governor or magistrate. It is a singular record of the Renaissance garden of the Monheim Palace. The work is hosted by the [[Bavarian State Library]] and may have been inspired by the '[[Hortus Eystettensis]]' of 1613. &lt;ref&gt;http://bibliodyssey.blogspot.co.za/2009/09/hortulus-monheimensis.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology of the Monheim region ==
Monheim lies at the edge of the region of the [[Solnhofen limestone]] in what was once the [[Tethys Ocean]]. Fossil crocodiles, such as ''[[Geosaurus]]'', ''[[Cricosaurus]]'', ''[[Rhacheosaurus]]'' and ''[[Steneosaurus]]'' are all known from quarries near Monheim, while ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' was found in the region around [[Solnhofen]].  The Gailach, the little river who runs through Monheim, disappears in the ground to travel underneath the surface shortly after passing Warching and resurfaces in Mühlheim, approximately 4&amp;nbsp;km further on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uok.bayern.de/static/GEOTOPE/GEOTOPE_169.html Geotop 176Q009 Gailachquelle in Muehlheim] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is the [[limestone]] in the region, which makes [[sinkholes]] a very common site. A marked trail, the ''Karstlehrpfad Monheimer Alb'' with signs in German explaining the origins of the landscape and the geology.

==Local Dialect==
The local dialect of the region is [[Alemannic German]], referred to in German as ''Schwäbisch'', with Monheim being at the most northeastern point of its extension. Traveling north, the villages beyond Monheim speak 
[[East Franconian German]] dialects while to the east, [[Austro-Bavarian|Bavarian]] is spoken.

'''Mykola Mykolayovych Arkas''' (born 7 January 1853, [[Mykolaiv]] – 26 September 1909, [[Mykolaiv]]) was a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] composer, writer, historian, and cultural activist. Arkas was the author of a popular book ''History of Ukraine'' (1908) and his most notable composition was the opera "Kateryna".

== Biography ==

Mykola Arkas was born on {{OldStyleDateDY|7 January|1853|26 December 1852}}, in [[Mykolaiv]] in the family of the [[Admiral]] of the [[Black Sea Fleet]] Mykola Arkas, and Sophia, née Bogdanovich.

Mykola received his all-round education in the Law School of St. Petersburg and completed his studies in physics and mathematics at the [[University of Odessa]]. After completing his studies (1875–1981), in accordance with the family tradition, he joined the Imperial Russian Navy.

Upon completion of naval service in 1881 Arkas obtained a [[Magistrate|magistracy]] in [[Kherson]]. In his leisure time he collected and recorded folk songs, also studying the history of Ukraine. His teacher, [[Petro Nishchynsky]], who was a Ukrainian composer, conductor and writer, had an influence upon Mykola; the latter tried to master musical knowledge independently, to develop his composer's skills and writing music.

Mykola Arkas died on {{OldStyleDateDY|26 March|1909|13 March}}, in Myoklaiv, where he was buried in the family chapel in the town cemetery.

== Compositions and other cultural activities ==

Arkas's artistic contributions include about 80 compositions for solo-singing, vocal ensembles and arrangements of folk songs. His opera '''"Kateryna"''' (1890) is the most significant work of Mykola Arkas, adapted as from [[Taras Shevchenko]]'s poem of the same title. This work brought recognition to Mykola Arkas and became the first Ukrainian lyrical folk opera. Performances of "Kateryna" were a great success, first playing in Moscow by [[Mark Kropivnitskiy]]'s troupe in 1899, and later in Minsk, Vilnius and Kiev.

Arkas was the founder and chairman of the "Prosvita" cultural and educational society in Mykolaiv. At his own expense he opened a public school that taught in Ukrainian, as the dominant teaching language in schools was Russian.

In 1908 in [[St. Petersburg]], a book by Mykola Arkas – "History of Ukraine-Rus" – was published under the editorship of Ukrainian writer Vasyl Domaniczky. The book was written in Ukrainian.

== Commemoration ==

* In October 1992 in Myoklaiv there was open a monument to Mykola Arkas (by sculptor O.Zdykhovskiy)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.familyface.net/nikolaev/photo.php?4605&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2003 a postage stamp was released in Ukraine dedicated to Mykola Arkas

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8525">''' Native American studies''' (also known as American Indian, Indigenous American, Aboriginal, Native, or First Nations studies) is an interdisciplinary academic field that examines the history, culture, politics, issues, and contemporary experience of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native]] peoples in North America,&lt;ref name=native/&gt; or, taking a hemispheric approach, [[the Americas]]. Increasingly, debate has focused on the differences rather than the similarities between other [[Ethnic studies]] disciplines such as [[African American studies]], [[Asian American Studies]], and [[Latino/a Studies]]. In particular, the [[Native American sovereignty|political sovereignty]] of many indigenous nations marks substantive differences in historical experience from that of other racial and ethnic groups in the United States and Canada. Drawing from numerous disciplines such as [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[history]], [[literature]], [[political science]], and [[gender studies]], Native American studies scholars consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse analytical and methodological tools in their work.&lt;ref name=native&gt;Heitshu, Marshall (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two key concepts shape Native American studies, according to [[Crow Creek Reservation|Crow Creek]] [[Lakota people|Lakota]] scholar [[Elizabeth Cook-Lynn]], indigenousness (as defined in culture, geography, and philosophy) and sovereignty (as legally and historically defined).&lt;ref name=c11&gt;Cook-Lynn (1997), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners advocate for [[indigenous decolonization|decolonization]] of [[indigenous people]]s, political [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]], and the establishment of a discipline dedicated to alleviating contemporary problems facing indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name=native/&gt;

==History==
The Native historical experience in the Americas is marked by forcible and sometimes willing attempts at [[cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilation]] into mainstream European American culture ([[Americanization (of Native Americans)|Americanization]]). Beginning with missionaries and leading up to [[American Indian boarding schools|federally controlled schools]], the aim was to educate American Indians so that they could go back to their communities and facilitate the assimilation process. As cited by David Beck in his article "American Indian Higher Education before 1974: From Colonization to Self-Determination," the schools were used as a tool for assimilation. Their main focus was not intellectual but to give training for industrial jobs or domestic jobs.&lt;ref name=native/&gt;

The [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s-1960s contested mainstream methods of assimilationist indoctrination and the substance of what was being taught in K-12 schools and universities throughout the United States. American Indian students, coupled with sympathetic professors, assisted in creating new programs with new aims. Rather than being focused on Indians going back to their communities to educate along the lines of assimilation there was a move to educate for empowerment. Programs that did community outreach and focused on student retention in campuses have risen out of that movement. Furthermore, the programs in schools created a new interpretation for American Indian history, sociology, and politics.&lt;ref name=native/&gt;

During the First Convocation of American Indian Scholars in March 1970 at [[Princeton University]], indigenous scholars drafted a plan to develop "Native American Studies as an Academic Disclipine," which would defend indigenous control of their lands and [[indigenous rights]] and would ultimately reform [[US Indian Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook-Lynn (1997), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; This discipline would be informed by traditional indigenous knowledge, especially [[oral history]],&lt;ref&gt;Cook-Lynn (1997), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and would "defend indigenous nationhood in America."&lt;ref name=c11/&gt;

In direct opposition to Western anthropology, the knowledge base of Native American studies is [[endogenous]], or emerging from within the indigenous communities. Developers of Native American studies widely dismissed the notion of [[scientific objectivity]],&lt;ref name=c11/&gt; since Western cultural biases have historically informed anthropology and other disciplines.

[[Image:Old City Hall and Terauley Street.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Old City Hall (Toronto)|Old City Hall]] in Toronto in 1907.  Its proposed demolition in the 1960s contributed to increased heritage awareness in Ontario, which led to heritage protection measures such as the ''Ontario Heritage Act''.]]
The '''''Ontario Heritage Act''''', (the ''Act'') first enacted on March 5, 1975,  allows [[municipality|municipalities]] and the [[province|provincial]] government to designate individual properties and districts in the Province of [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], as being of [[cultural heritage]] value or interest.

==Designation under the Ontario Heritage Act==
Once a property has been designated under Part IV of the ''Act'', a property owner must apply to the local municipality for a permit to undertake alterations to any of the identified heritage elements of the property or to [[demolition|demolish]] any buildings or structures on the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/Resources-and-Learning/Ontario-Heritage-Act-Register.aspx|title=Ontario Heritage Act Register|website=Heritagetrust.on.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part V of the ''Act'' allows for the designation of [[Historic district|heritage conservation districts]].

==Amendments to the legislation==
Until 2005, a designation of a property under the ''Act'' allowed a municipality to delay, but not ultimately prevent, the demolition of a heritage property.  Heritage advocates were highly critical of the 180-day "cooling off" period provided for under the legislation, which was intended to allow time for municipalities and landowners to negotiate an appropriate level of heritage preservation, but often simply resulted in the landowner "waiting out the clock" and demolishing the heritage building once the protection of the ''Ontario Heritage Act'' had expired.

In 2005, the provincial government enacted changes to strengthen the Act.  Under the amended legislation, a landowner who is refused a demolition permit under the ''Act'' no longer has an automatic right to demolish a designated building once the cooling off period has expired.  Instead, the landowner has the option to [[appeal]] the permit refusal to the [[Conservation Review Board]] for individual properties or the [[Ontario Municipal Board]] for properties within a Heritage Conservation District and the appropriate board would make the final decision on whether or not a demolition permit is issued. Where the OMB refuses to issue a permit, the landowner would have no choice but to preserve the heritage building.

The amended legislation also contains provisions which enable municipalities to enact by-laws to require owners of designated buildings to maintain the structures and their heritage elements.  Such by-laws are intended to prevent "demolition by neglect", although the collapse of [[Walnut Hall]] in Toronto demonstrates that such buildings are still at risk.

==Implementation and issues==
[[File:Edward Pease house sign.jpg|thumbnail|left|Plaque on a structure in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], showing that the building is protected under the Act.]]
Heritage designation is not universally welcomed. Because it imposes restrictions, or at least delay, on alteration or demolition of protected properties, some owners and would-be developers feel their property rights are compromised. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page215.aspx|title=Provincial Policy Statement|website=Mah.gov.on.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockcliffepark.ca/heritage.html|title=Rockcliffe Park Residents Association|first=Carmine|last=Domenicucci|website=Rockcliffepark.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There is also concern that the restrictions will make it more difficult to sell and/or develop affected properties, with a negative impact on market values.

[[Ottawa]]: As part of the city’s heritage inventory project, the city is reviewing properties in Old Ottawa East and Old Ottawa South and placing those considered to have “cultural heritage value” on a registry. Owners will be required to give 60 days notice to the city before demolishing a listed property. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawasun.com/2017/07/13/landowners-dont-buy-citys-sell-job-on-heritage-registry|title=Landowners don't buy city's sell job on heritage registry|website=Ottawasun.com|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rockcliffe Park]]: The entire village, which is now part of the City of Ottawa, became a [[Heritage Conservation District]] in 2016&lt;ref&gt;City of Ottawa By-Law No. 2016 - 89&lt;/ref&gt;. The objective is not just conservation of individual buildings but of the park-like qualities of the area as a whole. This means that lot sizes, spacings between houses, and streetscapes are also protected; for example, new circular driveways are no longer permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockcliffepark.ca/Final%202016%20-%20%20RPHCDPlan.pdf|format=PDF|title=ROCKCLIFFE PARK HERITAGE CONSERVATION DISTRICT PLAN|website=Rockcliffepark.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a current appeal by a home-owner who is also a developer &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/richcraft-lobby-council-270-buchan-city-hall-access-1.4132749|title=Rockcliffe home debate feeds fears about developers' access to city hall|website=Cbc.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/rockcliffe-park-residents-oppose-housing-development&lt;/ref&gt;. Pending the outcome of a September 2017 hearing before the [[Ontario Municipal Board]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omb.gov.on.ca/e-decisions/mm160031-Mar-20-2017.pdf|format=PDF|title=This is the first Pre-Hearing in the appeal before the Board relating to the passing of Heritage By-law No. 2016-89 by the City of Ottawa (the “City”), which adopted the Rockcliffe Park Heritage Conservation District Plan for the Rockcliffe Park Heritage Conservation District|website=Omb.gov.on.ca|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, City of Ottawa policy is to continue to apply the Heritage Conservation Plan.

Experience with the new provisions of the Act has been mixed.  Municipalities, who were given significantly greater authority with the amendments, have, in some cases, used the authority to prevent or delay development proposals, with questionable intent.  In one case a golf course was designated when the local Council received a proposal to develop it for housing.

Another flashpoint has been proposals to develop or significantly alter church properties. The government of Ontario has recently published a guideline that provides a context for the inherent conflict between religious beliefs and the civil authority over religious property that is enabled by the Act.  The "Guide to Conserving Heritage Places of Worship in Ontario Communities" is part of the Ontario Heritage Toolkit.  The Guide provides an understanding of how religious and heritage preservation goals can be balanced.

Properties under federal jurisdiction are also problematic; enterprises such as banking, navigation and interprovincial rail operate beyond the jurisdiction of Ontario's government. Various federal [[private member's bill]]s (''[[Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act]]'', ''[[Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act]]'') attempt to restrict demolition of historic properties, but all are narrow in scope and provide no protection against demolition by neglect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1357">'''Privatier''' ([{{IPA|pʀiˈvaˈtjeː}}], also spelled '''Privatus''', with the feminine forms '''Privata''' or '''Privatière''', meaning "private person") is a French word that was used from the 19th century in [[Germany]] and some other countries as a title by members of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] families of substantial financial means in lieu of another professional title. Much like [[wikt:rentier|rentier]], it denoted someone who did not have to work to make a living, and who lived off their assets of some size, e.g. [[interest]], [[Profit (economics)|profits]] from [[investor|investments]], [[real estate]] and [[current asset]]s. Sometimes, the title was used by affluent businessmen after they had wholly or largely retired from their former activity. For example, in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novel ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'', the character Alois Permaneder, a former merchant, uses this title after his marriage to Tony Buddenbrook, after receiving a substantial [[dowry]] from her wealthy family, at which point he retires from business.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Mann]]: ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'', part 6, chapter 8, Frankfurt 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of the British Isles}}

[[Ireland]] can be said to have had a [[protohistory|protohistorical]] period, when, in [[Prehistoric Ireland#Iron Age|prehistory]], the literate cultures of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and  [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] began to take notice of it, and a further proto-literate period of [[ogham]] [[epigraphy]], before the [[Early history of Ireland|early historical]] period began in the 5th century. Attempts have been made to reconstruct the political developments of this period by reference to early medieval Irish genealogical texts.

==Ireland in Classical literature==
{{Main|Hiberno-Roman relations}}

===Early references===
Classical writers occasionally refer to Ireland under a variety of names, but these references contain little reliable information. For example, [[Diodorus Siculus]] claims that the ''Prettanoi'' of the island of ''Iris'' eat human flesh.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Historical Library'' 5.32&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]], who calls the island ''Ierne'', repeats the accusation, adding that they consider it honourable to eat their dead fathers, and openly have sex with their mothers and sisters (although he is sceptical about his sources).&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/4E*.html#4 4.5.4]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pomponius Mela]] calls it ''Iuverna'' and says that, although the climate is unfavourable for grain, grass grows so richly that cattle burst if unrestrained from eating it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pomponius Mela]], ''De Chorographia'' 3.53&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar]], in his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', is the first to call the island ''[[Hibernia]]'', describes it as about half the size of Britain, and correctly places it to the west of Britain&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Caesar]], ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 5#13|5.13]]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; unlike Strabo, who places it to the north.

===Tacitus===
[[Tacitus]] says that his father-in-law [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], while governor of Britain (AD 78-85), considered conquering Ireland, believing it could be held with one [[Roman legion|legion]] plus [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]], and entertained an exiled Irish petty king with the intention of making him the pretext for conquest.&lt;ref name=ta24&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'' [[s:Agricola#24|24]]&lt;/ref&gt; Parallels have been drawn with the Irish legend of [[Túathal Techtmar]], who is said to have been exiled to Britain as a child and returned with an army to claim the kingship of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]] in the 1st century.&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Warner, "Tuathal Techtmar: A Myth or Ancient Literary Evidence for a Roman Invasion?", ''Emania'' 13, 1995, pp. 23–32&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus also says that most of the harbours and approaches to Ireland were known through commerce, but inaccurately locates the island between Britain and the [[Iberian peninsula]].&lt;ref name=ta24 /&gt;

===Juvenal===
The 2nd-century poet [[Juvenal]], in his second ''[[Satires of Juvenal|Satire]]'', contrasting the victories of the Roman army with the low morals of the people at home in Rome, says that, as well as conquering Britain and the [[Orkney]] islands, "we have advanced arms beyond the shores of ''Iuverna''". Although Juvenal is not writing history, it is possible that he is referring to a genuine Roman military expedition to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Freeman, ''Ireland and the Classical World'', University of Texas Press, 2001, pp. 62-64&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ptolemy ===
The 2nd-century [[Alexandria]]n Greek writer [[Ptolemy]], one of the most important geographers, mathematicians and astronomers in the ancient world, refers to Ireland in two of his works. In the astronomical treatise known as the ''[[Almagest]]'' he gives the latitudes of an island he calls ''Mikra Brettania'' (Μικρὰ Βρεττανία) or "Little Britain" (the south of the island at 58 degrees, the north at 61 degrees). In his ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', at the same latitudes, he places the Prettanic island ''Iwernia'', next to its neighbour, the Prettanic island ''[[Albion]]'' ([[Great Britain]]). The ''Geography'' contains the most detailed account of Ireland in classical literature, giving the latitude and longitude of six promontories, fifteen river mouths, ten settlements and nine islands, and naming sixteen population groups.&lt;ref name="freeman" /&gt;

Peoples of Ireland according to [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]''.&lt;ref name="freeman"&gt;Philip Freeman, ''Ireland and the Classical World'', University of Texas Press, 2001, pp. 64-84&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

====North coast====
Ptolemy describes the northern coast of Ireland, from the Northern Promontory (possibly [[Bloody Foreland]] or Rossan Point in [[County Donegal]]) in the west, to the ''Wenniknion'' promontory (probably [[Malin Head]]), the mouth of the river ''Widwa'' (probably the [[River Foyle|Foyle]]), the mouth of the river ''Argita'' (perhaps the [[River Bann|Bann]]) and the ''Rhobogdion'' promontory ([[Fair Head]], [[County Antrim]]) in the east. The peoples who inhabit the north coast are the ''Wenniknioi'' in the west and the ''Rhobogdioi'' in the east.&lt;ref name="freeman" /&gt;

====West coast====
The west coast is poorly represented compared to the other three, and identification of the names Ptolemy gives is speculative. He begins with the Northern Promontory (see above), and working north to south names the river ''Rhawiu'' (possibly the [[River Erne|Erne]]); the town ''[[Nagnata|Magnata]]'' (a settlement of the ''Magnatai'' people, possibly somewhere in [[County Sligo]]); the mouth of the rivers ''Libniu'' (possiby [[Clew Bay]]), ''Ausoba'' (perhaps [[Galway Bay]]) ''Senu'' (probably the [[River Shannon|Shannon]], although placed too far to the north), ''Dur'' (possibly [[Dingle Bay]]) and ''Iernu'' (possibly the [[Kenmare]]), and the Southern Promontory (any one of [[Slea Head]], [[Bray Head]], [[Dursey Head]] and [[Mizen Head]]). Peoples of this coast are: the ''[[Erdini|Erdinoi]]'' near Donegal Bay; the ''[[Nagnatae|Magnatai]]'' or ''Nagnatai'' of County Mayo and Sligo; the ''Auteinoi'' between County Galway and the Shannon, identifiable with the early medieval [[Uaithni]]; the ''[[Gangani|Ganganoi]]'', also known in north [[Wales]], and the ''Wellaboroi'' in the far south-west.&lt;ref name="freeman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="or"&gt;[[T. F. O'Rahilly]], ''Early Irish History and Mythology'', Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1946&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eoin MacNeill]], "Early Irish population groups: their nomenclature, classification and chronology", ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'' (C) 29, 1911, pp. 59–114&lt;/ref&gt;

====South coast====
The south coast stretches from the Southern Promontory to the mouths of the rivers ''Dabrona'' (possibly the [[River Lee (Ireland)|Lee]] or the [[Munster Blackwater|Blackwater]]) and ''Birgu'' (probably the [[River Barrow|Barrow]]) and the Sacred Promontory ([[Carnsore Point]], [[County Wexford]]). Peoples of the south coast are the ''[[Iverni|Iwernoi]]'' in the west, who share their name with the island, ''Iwernia'', and can be identified with the early medieval Érainn; the ''Usdiai'', and the ''[[Brigantes]]'' in the east, who share their name with a people of [[Roman Britain]].&lt;ref name="freeman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="or" /&gt;

====East coast====
From the Sacred Promontory in the south to the ''Rhobogdion'' promontory in the north, Ptolemy names the river ''Modonnu'' (possibly the [[River Slaney|Slaney]], but more likely the [[River Avoca|Avoca]]), the town of ''Manapia'' (a settlement of the ''Manapii''), the river ''Oboka'' (perhaps the [[River Liffey|Liffey]]; the river Avoca takes its modern name from a misinterpretation of Ptolemy's ''Oboka''), the town of ''Eblana'' (a settlement of the ''Eblanoi'', formerly mistakenly identified with [[Dublin]]), the river ''Buwinda'' (the [[River Boyne|Boyne]]), the promontory ''Isamnion'', the river ''Winderios'' (possibly [[Carlingford Lough]], [[Dundrum Bay]] or [[Strangford Lough]]), and the river ''Logia'' ([[Belfast Lough]], ''Loch Laoigh'' in Irish). Peoples named, from south to north, are: the ''[[Coriondi|Koriondoi]]''; the ''Manapioi'', possibly related to the [[Menapii]] of Gaul; the ''[[Cauci|Kaukoi]]'', probably not related to the Germanic [[Chauci]] of the Low Countries; the ''[[Eblani|Eblanoi]]''; the ''Woluntioi'', identifiable with the early medieval [[Ulaid]]; and the ''[[Darini|Darinoi]]''.&lt;ref name="freeman" /&gt;

===Later references===
Roman sources mention raids on Britain by [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxons]] of north-west [[Germany]], by [[Picts]] from [[Scotland]] and by two groups of people usually associated with Ireland, the [[Scoti|Scotti]] and the [[Atacotti]]. The origins and meanings of Scotti and Atacotti is uncertain. Atacotti disappears with the Romans. Scotti means [[Gaels]] to [[Adomnán]] in the late seventh century, but not to Columbanus in the early sixth century, who uses the older term Iberi instead. The Scotti are perhaps a confederation of tribes in Ulster, and the Atacotti one in Leinster, but this is not certain.&lt;ref&gt;Charles-Edwards, pp. 158&amp;ndash;160. Origins in the [[Hebrides]] have also been suggested for the Atacotti. The Late Roman army as recorded by the [[Notitia Dignitatum]] included [[auxilia palatina]] named for the Atacotti, the normal interpretation of such names being that they were recruited from prisoners of war.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ricardo Augusto Caminos''' (c. 1916 – May 28, 1992) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Egyptologist]] focused on [[epigraphy]] and [[paleography]]. Caminos was born in [[Buenos Aires]] and had a brother Hugo and sister Helena.  As a child he was fascinated by ancient history, and went on to obtain his undergraduate degree and M.A. (1938) from the [[University of Buenos Aires]].  After studying for PhD's from both [[Oxford University]] and the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Oriental Institute, Chicago]], he worked on number of Egyptian and Sudanese excavations, including those about to be flooded by the construction on the [[Aswan Dam]].  Around 1952 he was hired by [[Brown University]], and in 1972 he became the chairman of the Egyptology department, retiring in 1980.  He then moved to [[London]] where he conducted research at the nearby [[Egypt Exploration Society]].

'''Romuald Guarna''' (between 1110 and 1120 &amp;ndash; 1 April 1181/2) was the  [[Archbishop of Salerno]] (as '''Romuald II''')   from 1153 to his death. He is remembered primarily for his ''Chronicon sive Annales'', an important historical record of his time.

Romuald was a native of Salerno, born into the old [[Lombards|Lombard]] nobility. He studied as a youth in the [[Schola Medica Salernitana]], where he studied not only medicine (in which he taught [[Gilles de Corbeil]]), but history, law, and theology. Romuald was raised to the Salernitan archbishopric after the death of [[William of Ravenna]].

Romuald was a diplomat for the kings [[William I of Sicily|William I]] and [[William II of Sicily|William II]]. He negotiated the [[Treaty of Benevento]] of 1156 and signed the [[Treaty of Venice]] in 1177. Though he took part in the conspiracy against the [[Admiral]] [[Maio of Bari]], he never fell out of favour and even performed the coronation of William II. Despite this, he exaggerates his own importance in his chronicle, which characteristically begins at creation and extends till 1178.

In 1160-1161, Romuald defended the city from the enraged William I, who was avenging the assassination of Maio. With the help of Salernitans at court and their connections to the king's intimates, the city was spared. In 1167, as the highest-ranking prelate in the realm, he crowned William II as king in the [[Cathedral of Palermo]].

In 1179, Romuald intervened in a council condemning the [[Albigensians]]. He was succeeded by [[Nicholas of Ajello]].

'''Rudolf Capell''' (born 24 January 1635 in [[Hamburg]], died 24 April 1684 in Hamburg) was a German historian, linguist and pedagogue. He was renowned internationally as one of the great learned men of his time.&lt;ref&gt;''Das Hamburger Schriftstellerlexikon'', Vol. 1 pp. 500–506&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Beneke]]: "Capell, Rudolf." In: ''[[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]'' (ADB). Vol. 3, Duncker &amp; Humblot, Leipzig 1876, p. 770&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the son of Hamburg pastor Jodocus Capell, and attended the [[University of Wittenberg]], the [[University of Giessen]] earned the degree of [[Magister (degree)|Magister]] in 1656 and became [[Professor]] of [[Rhetoric]] at the [[Akademisches Gymnasium (Hamburg)|Akademisches Gymnasium]] of Hamburg in 1660. In 1675, he became Professor of History and Greek language.  He published 97 works on historical and philological topics.

He was married to Anna Berenberg (1639–1669). His daughter Christina Adelheid Capell (1663–1730) was married to Hamburg and Lisbon merchant Paul [[Amsinck]] (1649–1706).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13981">[[File:Pizzigano 1424 map (Antilia islands detail).JPG|thumb|120px|1424 map of [[Zuane Pizzigano]], the first depiction of the island of Satanazes as a large blue rectangular isle north of [[Antillia]].]]

The island of '''Satanazes''' (also called the island of '''Devils''', or of the '''Hand of Satan''' or of '''St. Athanasius''') is a [[phantom island|legendary island]] once thought to be located in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and depicted on many 15th-century maps.

== Cartographic depiction ==
In 15th-century [[portolan chart]]s, the island of Satanazes is depicted as lying out in the north [[Atlantic Ocean]], due west of the [[Azores]] and [[Portugal]], and just north of the legendary island of [[Antillia]].

The island was first depicted in the 1424 [[portolan chart]] of [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] cartographer [[Zuane Pizzigano]].  It is drawn as a large, blue rectangular island, indented with bays and five or six settlements, with the inscription ''ista ixolla dixemo satanazes'', which has been translated as "this is the island called of the devils".

In his 1424 chart, Pizzigano placed Satanazes some sixty leagues north of the large ''[[Antillia]]'' island. Pizzigano capped Satanazes with a little umbrella-shaped island he labels ''Saya'' (which later cartographers will call ''Tanmar'' or ''Danmar''). These three islands, plus ''[[Royllo|Ymana]]'' (later called ''Royllo'', a little companion west of Antillia), would be collectively drawn together in many later 15th-century maps, with the same relative size, position and shape Pizzigano originally gave them, and known collectively as the "Antillia group" or (to use Bianco's label) the ''insulae de novo rep(er)te'' ("islands newly reported").

In [[Grazioso Benincasa]]'s  1463 atlas, the settlements on Satanazes island are named  Araialis, Cansillia, Duchal, Jmada, Nam and Saluaga.&lt;ref&gt;Cortesão (1954 (1975), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2PbNS0LHn60C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=RA1-PA140#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.140])&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartographic appearances of Satanazes:&lt;ref&gt;List from Cortesão (1954 (1975): [https://books.google.com/books?id=2PbNS0LHn60C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=RA1-PA134#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.134])&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1424 map of [[Zuane Pizzigano]] of [[Venice]] as ''ista ixolla dixemo satanazes''
* 1435 map of [[Battista Beccario]] of [[Genoa]] as ''Satanagio''
* 1436 map of [[Andrea Bianco]] of [[Venice]] as ''Ya de la man satanaxio''
* 1463, 1470 and 1482 maps of [[Grazioso Benincasa]] of [[Ancona]] as ''Saluaga''/''Salvaga'' (u and v are equivalent)
* 1460s anonymous [[Weimar map]] (attrib. to [[Conte di Ottomano Freducci]] of Ancona) as ''Salvagio''.&lt;ref&gt;The use of Beinincasa's "Salvaga" rather than the older "Satanaxio" in the [[Weimar map]] is one of the critical factors in adjusting the estimate of the Weimar map's composition date from 1424 (Humboldt's original estimate) to sometime in the 1460s or after.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1480 and 1489 maps of [[Pedro Roselli]] of [[Majorca]] as ''Salvatga''
* 1480 and 1489 maps of [[Albino de Canepa]] of Venice as ''Salvagia''
* 1487 map of anonymous Majorcan cartographer as ''Salvaja''
* 1493 [[Laon globe]] as ''Salirosa''

Significantly, the island of Satanazes is omitted on the maps of [[Bartolomeo Pareto]] (1455), [[Cristoforo Soligo]] (c. 1475) Grazioso's son [[Andrea Benincasa]] (1476) and the Nuremberg globe of [[Martin Behaim]] (1492), even though they all include [[Antillia]] and some retain ''Saya''/''Tanmar''.&lt;ref&gt;Cortesão (1954 (1975): p.134)&lt;/ref&gt;

Satanazes disappears on practically all maps after [[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyages of the 1490s. It was possibly transplanted (in smaller form) to the [[Isle of Demons]], between Newfoundland and Greenland, e.g. the 1508 map of [[Johannes Ruysch]].

== Etymology and legend ==
According to Cortesão, Pizzigano's 'Satanazes' is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "satans" or "devils", Beccaria's 'Satanagio' is the same word in [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]] dialect and Bianco's  'Satanaxio' the same in [[Venetian language|Venetian]].&lt;ref&gt;Cortesão (1954 (1975): p.135)&lt;/ref&gt;  The island disappears from maps after 1436, and reappears only in 1462 when Benincasa switches it to ''Salvaga'', meaning 'savage' – possibly a misreading, more probably a deliberate adjustment by Benincasa to avoid using the [[profanity]] of "devil". The Laon globe's 'Salirosa' is an apparent mis-transcription of 'Salvaga'.

Historians have conjectured the "Devils" of Satanazes might be a reference to the [[Skraelings]] ([[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] of [[Greenland]] and [[Vinland]]) reported in the [[Norsemen|Norse]] sagas, notably the [[Grœnlendinga saga]] and the [[saga of Erik the Red]], which began to filter south around this time. Pizzigano may have constructed Satanazes island to capture their rough geographic location.&lt;ref&gt;Cortesão (1954 (1975), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2PbNS0LHn60C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=RA1-PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.137ff]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The possible connection between the Satanazes and the Skraelings was first proposed by Nordenskiöld (1889), his attention drawn by an inscription on some islands between Newfoundland and Greenland in the 1508 map of [[Johannes Ruysch]], which notes how 'devils' located there attacked sailors (See [[Isle of Demons]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nordenskiöld (1889: p.65).&lt;/ref&gt;   The connection need not require direct knowledge of the Norse sagas themselves, e.g. [[Fridtjof Nansen]] has drawn attention to how Norse encounters with North American 'demons' were adopted in Irish ''[[immram]]a'',.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fridtjof Nansen]] (1911: vol.2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JoUvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.9])&lt;/ref&gt; Given the tendency of the legends of Atlantic seafarers – Norse, Irish, Arab and Iberian – to move quickly and cross-fertilize each other,&lt;ref&gt;Nansen (1911: vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JoUvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.54]).&lt;/ref&gt; the news of an Isle of Devils out in the North Atlantic may have arrived to Italian cartographers via several channels.

[[Georg Hassel]] conjectured that, by their size and shape, the large islands of Satanazes and Antillia may represent the coasts of [[North America]] and [[South America]] respectively,&lt;ref&gt;Hassel (1822: p.6)&lt;/ref&gt; thus making it a possible testament of [[pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]].  Babcock conjectures the representation might be of the [[Caribbean]], that Satanazes represents [[Florida]] (and Antillia Cuba, Roylla Jamaica and Tanmar the Bahamas)&lt;ref&gt;Babckock, (1922: [https://books.google.com/books?id=-vYrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.155]; p.188)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hand of Satan.jpg|thumb|200px|The "Hand of Satan", emerging from the sea to snatch a boat]] 
[[Andrea Bianco]]'s 1436 long label ''Ya de la man santanaxio'' provoked Vicenzo Formaleoni (1783) to read it as the isle of "the Hand of Satan", an alternative name for Satanazes still found in some sources.&lt;ref&gt;Formaleoni (1783: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zso9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.48].  Buache (1806: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5XRFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.17]) and Humboldt (1837: [https://books.google.com/books?id=EicSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA179#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.179]) read it the same way.&lt;/ref&gt;  Formaleoni  proposed it might be connected to a legend from [[India]], about a giant hand that arose each day from the sea and carried off the inhabitants into the ocean.   This legend is told in the ''Perigrinaggio di tre giovani'' (''[[The Three Princes of Serendip]]'') first published in Venice in 1557 by Michele Tramezzino (alleged to be a translation from the [[Persian language|Persian]] of a certain Christopher of Armenia, ''Christoforo Armeno''). The story might have been circulating earlier among [[Atlantic Ocean]] seafarers, traced in Irish [[immram]]a and Arab tales, about a giant hand in the Sea of Darkness that plucked sailors and sometimes entire boats, and dragged them to the bottom of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;A fanciful version of the tale of the Hand of Satan is related in [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson|Higginson]] (1883:  [https://books.google.com/books?id=IxPgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.134]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Gaffarel suggests this might be a reference to the [[iceberg]]s of the North Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;This is proposed by Paul Gaffarel (1882: [https://books.google.com/books?id=NmxIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.211])&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marquis d'Avezac (1845) launched yet another theory, reading 'satanaxio' as ''S. Atanaxio'', i.e. the island of [[St. Athanasius]].&lt;ref&gt;D'Avezac (1845: [https://books.google.com/books?id=BbEBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.31]). Oddly, this reading was pursued by Nordenskiöld (1897: p.164), who sought to connect it to [[Anastasius of Persia|St. Anastasius]], even though he had earlier (1889) proposed the Satanazes = Skraelings connection.&lt;/ref&gt;  D'Avezac also makes the credible argument that the ''de la man satanaxio'' in Bianco's label is actually referencing two separate islands, Satanazes and ''Delaman'', probably the nearby ''Danmar'' or ''Tanmar'' of other maps, believed to be a reference to the legendary [[Isle of Mam]] (Babcock proposed an alternate reading of  Delaman/Danmar/Tanmar as ''I la Mar'', or "Island of the Sea".)&lt;ref&gt;Babcock (1922: [https://books.google.com/books?id=-vYrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.155])&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of the 1424 Pizzigano map in the 20th century, with its ''Satanazes'' clearly indicated, has allowed modern historians to set aside the old Hand of Satan/St. Athanasius theories, and embrace the Isle of Devils reading.&lt;ref&gt;Cortesão (1953, 1954, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite all these conjectures, there is little agreement.  Unlike its southern counterpart [[Antillia]] (which seems rather solidly connected to the [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] legend of the Seven Cities), Satanazes has been characterized as a legendary island in need of a legend.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Morison, 1971 p.101&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seymour Martin Lipset''' (March 18, 1922 – December 31, 2006) was an [[US|American]] [[sociologist]]. His major work was in the fields of political sociology, [[trade union]] organization, social stratification, public opinion, and the sociology of intellectual life. He also wrote extensively about the conditions for democracy in comparative perspective. A [[socialist]] in his early life, Lipset later moved to the right, and became one of the first American [[Neoconservatism|neoconservatives]].

At his death in 2006, ''The Guardian'' called him "the leading theorist of democracy and American exceptionalism"; ''The New York Times'' said he was "a pre-eminent sociologist, political scientist and incisive theorist of American uniqueness"; and the ''Washington Post'' said he was "one of the most influential social scientists of the past half century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McGovern |first1=Patrick |title=The young Lipset on the iron law of oligarchy: a taste of things to come1 |journal=The British Journal of Sociology |date=14 January 2010 |volume=61 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=29–42 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2009.01283.x |pmid=20092476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Lipset was born in [[Harlem]], [[New York City]], the son of [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jewish]] immigrants.&lt;ref name="JPost remembering"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Remembering-Seymour-Lipset-most-cited-political-scientist | title= Remembering Seymour Lipset, 'most cited' political scientist | first= Joe | last= Enskenazi |newspaper= Jerusalem Post| agency= JTA |date= 14 January 2007 | accessdate= 19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family urged him to become a dentist.&lt;ref name="NYTimes obit" /&gt;

He grew up in the Bronx among Irish, Italian and Jewish youth. "I was in that atmosphere where there was a lot of political talk," Lipset recalled, "but you never heard of Democrats or Republicans; the question was communists, socialists, Trotskyists, or anarchists. It was all sorts of different left wing groups." Seymour was active in the Young People's Socialist League, an organization of young Trotskyists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=G. |first1=Jesús Velasco |title=Seymour Martin Lipset: Life and Work |journal=The Canadian Journal of Sociology |date=2004 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=583–601 |doi=10.2307/3654712 |jstor=3654712}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He graduated from [[City College of New York]], where he was an [[anti-Stalinist left]]ist,&lt;ref name="JPost remembering" /&gt; and later became National Chairman of the [[Young People's Socialist League (1907)|Young People's Socialist League]].  He received a PhD in sociology from [[Columbia University]] in 1949. Before that he taught at the [[University of Toronto]].

==Academic career==
Lipset was the Caroline S.G. Munro Professor of Political Science and Sociology and a senior [[fellow]] at the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]] and then became the George D. Markham Professor of Government and Sociology at [[Harvard University]]. He also taught at Columbia University, the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of Toronto]], and George Mason University where was the Hazel Professor of [[Public Policy]].

Lipset was a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. He was the only person to have been President of both the [[American Political Science Association]] (1979–80) and the [[American Sociological Association]] (1992–93).&lt;ref name="NYTimes obit" /&gt; He also served as the President of the International Society of Political Psychology, the Sociological Research Association, the World Association for Public Opinion Research, the Society for Comparative Research, and the Paul F. Lazarsfeld Society in Vienna.

Besides making substantial contributions to [[cleavage (politics)|cleavage]] theory, with his partner [[Stein Rokkan]], Lipset was one of the first proponents of the "theory of modernization", which states that democracy is the direct result of economic growth, and that “[t]he more well-to-do a nation, the greater the chances that it will sustain democracy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Some Social Requisites of Democracy: Economic Development and Political Legitimacy |first=Seymour Martin |last= Lipset |journal= The American Political Science Review | volume= 53| issue= 1 |date= March 1959 | pages= 69–105 |jstor= 1951731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lipset's modernization theory has continued to be a significant factor in academic discussions and research relating to [[democratic transitions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diamond |first1=Larry Jay |title=Thinking About Hybrid Regimes |journal=Journal of Democracy |date=2002 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=21–35 |doi=10.1353/jod.2002.0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zakaria |first1=Fareed |title=The Rise of Illiberal Democracy |journal=Foreign Affairs |date=1997 |volume=76 |issue=6 |pages=22–43 |doi=10.2307/20048274 |jstor=20048274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lipset received the MacIver Prize for ''[[Political Man]]'' (1960) and, in 1970, the [[Gunnar Myrdal Prize]] for ''[[The Politics of Unreason]]''.

In 2001, Lipset was named among the top 100 American intellectuals, as measured by academic citations, in [[Richard Posner]]'s book, ''Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Posner|first=Richard|title=Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-00633-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public affairs==
Lipset left the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] in 1960 and later described himself as a centrist, deeply influenced by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], [[George Washington]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Max Weber]].&lt;ref name=WPost&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/03/AR2007010301793.html |title= Political Scientist Seymour Lipset, 84; Studied Democracy and U.S. Culture |first= Patricia |last= Sullivan |date= 4 January 2007 |newspaper= [[Washington Post]] |accessdate= 19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became active within the Democratic Party's conservative wing, and was one of the 'original neoconservatives', a small group of public intellectuals who were the first to be called neoconservatives.&lt;ref name="NYTimes obit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/206955/neoconservative-invention/jonah-goldberg |title= The Neoconservative Invention | work=National Review| date= 20 May 2003 | first= Jonah |last= Goldberg| accessdate= 19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lipset was vice-chair of the board of directors of the [[United States Institute of Peace]],&lt;ref name="Spencer Peace" /&gt; a board member of the [[Albert Shanker Institute]], a member of the US Board of Foreign Scholarships, co-chair of the Committee for Labor Law Reform, co-chair of the Committee for an Effective [[UNESCO]], and consultant to the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], the National Humanities Institute, the [[National Endowment for Democracy]], and the [[American Jewish Committee]].

Lipset was a strong supporter of the state of Israel, and was President of the American Professors for Peace in the [[Middle East]], chair of the National [[B'nai B'rith]] Hillel Commission and the Faculty Advisory Cabinet of the [[United Jewish Appeal]], and co-chair of the Executive Committee of the International Center for Peace in the Middle East. He worked for years on seeking solution for the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]&lt;ref name="Spencer Peace"&gt;{{cite journal| title= Seymour Martin Lipset 1922–2006| url= http://archive.peacemagazine.org/v23n2p15.htm |first= Metta |last= Spencer| work=Peace Magazine |volume= 23 |number= 2 |page= 15| date= April 2007 | accessdate= 19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of his larger project of research on the factors that allow societies to sustain stable and peaceful democracies. His work focused on the way in which high levels of socioeconomic development created the preconditions for democracy (see also [[Amartya Sen]]'s work), and the consequences of democracy for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Metta. "Lipset's Gift to Peace Workers: On Getting and Keeping Democracy"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Lipset's book ''The First New Nation'' was a finalist for the [[National Book Award]]. He was also awarded the [[Townsend Harris]] and Margaret Byrd Dawson Medals for significant achievement, the Northern Telecom-International Council for Canadian Studies Gold Medal, and the Leon Epstein Prize in Comparative Politics by the [[American Political Science Association]]. He received the Marshall Sklare Award for distinction in [[Jewish studies]] and, in 1997, he was awarded the Helen Dinnerman Prize by the World Association for Public Opinion Research.

==Personal life==
Lipset's first wife, Elsie, died in 1987. She was the mother of his three children, David, Daniel, and Carola&lt;ref name="NYTimes obit" /&gt; ("Cici"). David Lipset is a Professor of Anthropology at the [[University of Minnesota]]. He had six grandchildren. Lipset was survived by his second wife, Sydnee Guyer (a director of the JCRC),&lt;ref name="JPost remembering" /&gt; whom he married in 1990.

At age 84, Lipset died as a result of complications following a stroke.&lt;ref name="NYTimes obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name=WPost /&gt;

}}'''Tell es-Sultan''' (Sultan's Hill) is a [[UNESCO]]-listed archaeological site in the [[West Bank]],&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Jericho: Tell es-Sultan|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5704/|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; located two kilometres north of the centre of [[Jericho]]. The [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] was inhabited from the 10th millennium BCE, and has been called "the oldest town in the world", with many significant archaeological finds; the site is also notable for its role in the history of [[Levantine archaeology]].

==History==

===Natufian hunter-gatherers, {{circa}} 10,000 BCE===
The first permanent settlement on the site developed between 10,000 and 9000 BCE.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mama.org/exhibits/ancient/prehistoric/ |title=Prehistoric Cultures |publisher=Museum of Ancient and Modern Art |year=2010 |accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Younger Dryas]] period of cold and drought, permanent habitation of any one location was impossible. However, Tell es-Sultan was a popular camping ground for [[Natufian]] hunter-gatherer groups due to the nearby [[Ein as-Sultan]] spring; these hunter-gatherers left a scattering of crescent-shaped microlith tools behind them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mithen |first=Steven |title=After the ice: a global human history, 20,000-5000 BCE |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Mass. |isbn=0-674-01999-7 |page=57 |edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 9600 BCE the droughts and cold of the Younger Dryas [[stadial]] came to an end, making it possible for Natufian groups to extend the duration of their stay, eventually leading to year-round habitation and permanent settlement. [[Epipaleolithic]] construction at the site appears to predate the invention of [[agriculture]], with the construction of Natufian structures beginning earlier than 9000 BC, the very beginning of the [[Holocene]] epoch in geologic history.&lt;ref name=Freedmanp689&gt;Freedman et al., 2000, p. 689–671.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Pottery Neolithic, {{circa}} 8500 BCE===
[[File:Jerycho8.jpg|right|thumb|Dwelling foundations unearthed at Tell es-Sultan in Jericho]]
:'''Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA)'''
The Pre-Pottery Neolithic A phase at Tell es-Sultan (ca. 8500 – 7500 BCE)&lt;ref name=Nigro&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nigro|first1=Lorenzo|title=THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF COLLAPSE AND RESILIENCE: TELL ES-SULTAN/ANCIENT JERICHO AS A CASE STUDY|journal=ROME «LA SAPIENZA» STUDIES ON THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PALESTINE &amp; TRANSJORDAN|date=2014|volume=11|page=272|url=https://www.academia.edu/8688397/The_Archaeology_of_Collapse_and_Resilience_Tell_es-Sultan_ancient_Jericho_as_a_Case_Study|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the emergence of one of the world's first major [[proto-cities]]. As the world warmed up, a new culture based on agriculture and sedentary dwelling emerged, which archaeologists have termed "[[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]]" (abbreviated as PPNA), sometimes called the [[Neolithic#Fertile Crescent|Sultanian]] era after the town. PPNA villages are characterized by small circular dwellings, burial of the dead under the floor of buildings, reliance on hunting wild game, the cultivation of wild or domestic cereals, and no use of pottery yet.

The PPNA-era town, a settlement of around {{convert|40000|m2}}, contained round mud-brick houses, yet no street planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourfatherlutheran.net/biblehomelands/palestine/jericho/jericho.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220035014/http://www.ourfatherlutheran.net/biblehomelands/palestine/jericho/jericho.htm |archivedate=20 February 2008 |title=Old Testament Jericho |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=20 February 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circular dwellings were built of [[Adobe|clay and straw]] bricks left to dry in the sun, which were plastered together with a mud mortar. Each house measured about {{convert|5|m}} across, and was roofed with mud-smeared brush. Hearths were located within and outside the homes.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity and number of the inhabitants of Jericho during the PPNA period is still under debate, with estimates going as high as 2000–3000, and as low as 200–300.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia1"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9043547/Jericho "Jericho"], [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Akkermans 2004 57"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Akkermans |first1=Peter M.

The town was surrounded by a massive stone wall over {{convert|3.6|m}} high and {{convert|1.8|m}} wide at the base (see [[Tell es-Sultan#Wall of Jericho|Wall of Jericho]]), inside of which stood a stone tower (see [[Tell es-Sultan#Tower of Jericho|Tower of Jericho]]), placed in the centre of the west side of the tell.&lt;ref name="BarkaiLiran"&gt;Ran Barkai and Roy Liran.

:'''Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB)'''
After a few centuries, the first settlement was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase there was a settlement hiatus of several centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]. This second settlement, established in 6800 BCE, perhaps represents the work of an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten [[plastered human skulls]], painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features.&lt;ref name=Ringp367&gt;Ring et al., 1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R44VRnNCzAYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA367&amp;dq=jericho+babylonian+ring&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 367–370].&lt;/ref&gt; These represent either [[teraphim]] or an early example of [[portrait]]ure in [[art history]], and it is thought that they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.&lt;ref name=Freedmanp689/&gt;&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;Janson and Janson, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumb prints to facilitate bounding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room ({{convert|6.5|x|4|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} and {{convert|7|x|3|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}) with internal divisions, the rest are small, presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish [[terrazzo]]-floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors.

[[Kathleen Kenyon]] interpreted one building as a [[shrine]]. It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fit into this niche.

The dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A [[human skull|skull]] cache contained seven skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; [[cowry|cowries]] were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modelled skulls were found in [[Tell Ramad]] and [[Beisamoun]] as well.

Other finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s, scrapers, a few [[tranchet axe]]s, [[obsidian]], and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also [[Quern-stone|querns]], hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and [[Therianthropy|theriomorphic]] clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.

===Bronze Age===
:''This section deals with the archaeology of Bronze Age Jericho; for the Biblical battle, see [[Battle of Jericho]]''
A succession of settlements followed from 4500 BCE onward, the largest constructed in 2600 BCE.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt;

Tell es-Sultan was continually occupied into the Middle Bronze Age; it was destroyed in the Late Bronze, after which it no longer served as an urban centre. The city was surrounded by extensive defensive walls strengthened with rectangular towers, and possessed an extensive cemetery with vertical shaft-tombs and underground burial chambers; the elaborate funeral offerings in some of these may reflect the emergence of local kings.{{sfn|Kuijt|2012|p=167}}

During the Middle Bronze Age Tell es-Sultan was a small prominent city of the [[Canaan]] region, reaching its greatest Bronze Age extent in the period from 1700 to 1550 BCE. It seems to have reflected the greater urbanization in the area at that time, and has been linked to the rise of the [[Maryannu]], a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the [[Mitanni]]te state to the north. Kathleen Kenyon reported "...the Middle Bronze Age is perhaps the most prosperous in the whole history of Kna'an. ... The defenses ... belong to a fairly advanced date in that period" and there was "a massive stone revetment... part of a complex system" of defenses (pp.&amp;nbsp;213–218).&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, Kathleen "Digging up Jericho"(London, 1957)&lt;/ref&gt; The Bronze-Age city fell in the 16th century at the end of the Middle Bronze Age, the calibrated carbon remains from its City-IV destruction layer dating to 1617–1530 BCE. Notably this carbon dating {{circa}} 1573 BCE confirmed the accuracy of the stratigraphical dating {{circa}} 1550 by Kenyon.

===Iron Age===
Tell es-Sultan remained unoccupied from the end of the 15th to the 10th-9th centuries BCE, when the city was rebuilt.{{sfn|Jacobs|2000|p=691}} Of this new city not much more remains than a [[Four room house|four-room house]] on the eastern slope.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson"&gt;{{cite book |work=Archaeological Encyclopedia of the Holy Land |title=Jericho |author=Avraham Negev and Shimon Gibson |year=2001 |location=New York and London |publisher=Continuum |page=259 |isbn=0-8264-1316-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 7th century Jericho had become an extensive town, but this settlement was destroyed in the [[Neo-Babylonian empire|Babylonian]] conquest of [[kingdom of Judah|Judah]] in the late{{dubious|586 BCE is rather early, not late, in the century.|date=June 2017}} 6th century.{{sfn|Jacobs|2000|p=691}}

===Abandonment of the Tell===
After the destruction of the Judahite city by the Babylonians in the late{{dubious|586 BCE is rather early, not late, in the century.|date=June 2017}} 6th century,{{sfn|Jacobs|2000|p=691}} whatever was rebuilt in the Persian period as part of the [[Return to Zion#The return to Zion|Restoration]] after the [[Babylonian captivity]], left only very few remains.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson"/&gt; The tell was abandoned as a place of settlement not long after this period.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson"/&gt;

==Archaeological excavation==
{{See also|Levantine archaeology}}
The first excavations of the site were made by [[Charles Warren]] in 1868 at the request of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]. He dug through the mud bricks of the [[Tell es-Sultan#Wall of Jericho|wall]] without realizing what it was, suggesting there was little of interest at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wagemakers |first1=Bart |title=Archaeology in the 'Land of Tells and Ruins': A History of Excavations in the Holy Land Inspired by the Photographs and Accounts of Leo Boer |date=2014 |publisher=Oxbow Books |isbn=9781782972464 |page=122ff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNAVBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Sellin]] and [[Carl Watzinger]] excavated Tell es-Sultan and Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq between 1907–1909 and in 1911, finding the remains of two walls which they initially suggested supported the [[Bible|biblical]] account of the [[Battle of Jericho]]. They later revised this conclusion and dated their finds to the Middle [[Bronze Age]] (1950-1550 BC).&lt;ref name="Hoppe2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leslie J. Hoppe|title=New light from old stories: the Hebrew scriptures for today's world, p. 81-|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPUAPIYRTtAC&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=9 July 2011|date=September 2005|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=978-0-8091-4116-6|pages=82–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was again excavated by [[John Garstang]] between 1930 and 1936, who again raised the suggestion that remains of the upper wall was that described in the [[Bible]], and dated to around 1400 BCE.&lt;ref name="Bromiley1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey W. Bromiley|title=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: A-D|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wo8csizDv0gC&amp;pg=PA275|accessdate=9 July 2011|date=13 February 1995|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-3781-3|pages=275–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive investigations using more modern techniques were made by [[Kathleen Kenyon]] between 1952 and 1958. Her excavations discovered a [[Tell es-Sultan#Tower of Jericho|tower]] and [[Tell es-Sultan#Wall of Jericho|wall]] in trench I. Kenyon provided evidence that both constructions dated much earlier than previous estimates of the site's age, to the [[Neolithic]], and were part of an early [[proto-city]]. Her excavations found a series of seventeen early Bronze Age walls, some of which she thought may have been destroyed by [[earthquake]]s. The last of the walls was put together in a hurry, indicating that the settlement had been destroyed by nomadic invaders. Another wall was built by a more sophisticated culture in the Middle Bronze Age with a steep [[plaster]]ed escarpment leading up to mud bricks on top.&lt;ref name="Bromiley1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miriam C. Davis|title=Dame Kathleen Kenyon: digging up the Holy Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0qYqFpz_4CwC&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=9 July 2011|year=2008|publisher=Left Coast Press|isbn=978-1-59874-326-5|pages=101–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lorenzo Nigro]] and [[Nicolo Marchetti]] conducted excavations in 1997-2000. Since 2009 the Italian-Palestinian archaeological project of excavation and restoration was resumed by Rome "La Sapienza" University and Palestinian MOTA-DACH under the direction of Lorenzo Nigro and Hamdan Taha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tell es-Sultan/Jericho|url=http://www.lasapienzatojericho.it/|publisher=Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies by Ran Barkai from [[Tel Aviv University]] and Roy Liran have suggested [[astronomical]] and [[social]], rather than military, purposes in the construction of the tower.&lt;ref name="Parry"/&gt;

Gen. [[Janet C. Wolfenbarger]].

==Education and personal==
Gabreski was born Terry Lee Walter in 1952, the daughter of [[United States Air Force]] Brigadier General Alonzo J. Walter, Jr., then a [[test pilot]], and Doris Walter, who had also been a commissioned officer. After completing her [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[history]] at [[Louisiana State University]], where she was a member of [[Delta Delta Delta]], Gabreski joined the USAF, attended [[Air Force Officer Training School]], and was commissioned a [[Second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] on 10 September 1974. She later received a [[Master of Public Administration]] degree from [[Golden Gate University]] in 1978. Gabreski also attended the Executive Program for Senior Officials in National Security which was conducted in 1994 by the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]], [[Harvard University]], Cambridge, Massachusetts and the General Manager Program, [[Harvard Business School]], Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2002.&lt;ref name='BIO1'&gt;{{cite news |title=Biography: Lieutenant General Terry Walter Gabreski |date=May 2007 |publisher=Air Force Link |url =http://www.af.mil/bios/bio.asp?bioID=5475 |work =United States Air Force |accessdate = 2007-06-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070613181714/http://www.af.mil/bios/bio.asp?bioID=5475 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='DELTA'&gt;{{cite news |title=Member Details: Terry Walter Gabreski |year=2005 |url=http://www.tridelta.org/alumnae/Distinguished_Alumnae/distinguished_deltas/directory_detail.asp?blobID=4089 |work=[[Delta Delta Delta]] Fraternity |accessdate=2007-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205034/http://www.tridelta.org/alumnae/Distinguished_Alumnae/distinguished_deltas/directory_detail.asp?blobID=4089 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 she was selected as the USAF Aircraft Maintenance Company Grade Officer of the Year and was awarded the [[Eugene M. Zuckert]] Management Award in 1999 as recognition for her top-level Air Force management skills.&lt;ref name='BIO1'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ASC award winners Eugene M.

In 1989 she married Col. Donald Francis Gabreski, a retired USAF pilot, eldest son of World War II and Korean War ace, Col. [[Gabby Gabreski|Francis S. "Gabby" Gabreski]], and they had two sons, born in 1992 and 1995 after she had attained the rank of colonel.  On her retirement Gabreski noted that she applied three times for pilot training but had been turned down each time because being only five feet tall, she could not meet minimum height requirements for the [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38]] Talon trainer.&lt;ref name="t38"&gt;{{cite news |last= Rolfsen|first=Bruce|title= Trailblazer comes to end of 35-year career|date= November 20, 2009 |work= |publisher=[[Military Times]] |quote=|url= http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2009/11/airforce_gabreski_112009w/ |accessdate= June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assignments==
Prior to her final assignment, General Gabreski also served as commander of the [[Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center]] at [[Tinker Air Force Base]]&lt;ref name='SENATE'/&gt; (December 2003 - August 2005), which was the first Air Force installation to implement [[National Security Personnel System]] (NSPS),&lt;ref name='SENATE'/&gt; as Director of Logistics, Headquarters Air Force Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio (August 2001 - December 2003) and as Director of Maintenance for the Deputy Chief of Staff for Installations and Logistics at Headquarters U.S. Air Force (January 2000 - August 2001).&lt;ref name='BIO1'/&gt;

Other than these assignments she directed two aircraft maintenance units, served as a squadron maintenance supervisor in three units, commanded three maintenance squadrons and a logistics group and served at the Air Staff, [[Secretary of the Air Force]] and Joint Staff levels.&lt;ref name='BIO1'/&gt;

Gen. Gabreski also served as one of the original female Air Training Officers charged with mentoring the first female cadets of the U.S. Air Force Academy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2008/12/airforce_academywomen_honored_120808/&lt;/ref&gt; Then-Lt. Gabreski served in this role from January 1976 to September 1977 for the Class of 1980 female cadets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.af.mil/AboutUs/Biographies/Display/tabid/225/Article/104787/lieutenant-general-terry-l-gabreski.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35709">: ''This article is about urban history as a subject. See [[history of the city]] for a chronological description of cities.''
'''Urban history''' is a field of [[history]] that examines the historical nature of [[city|cities]] and [[town]]s, and the process of [[urbanization]]. The approach is often multidisciplinary, crossing boundaries into fields like [[social history]], [[architectural history]], [[urban sociology]], [[urban geography]], [[business history]], and [[archaeology]]. [[Urbanization]] and [[industrialization]] were popular themes for 20th-century historians, often tied to an implicit model of [[modernization]], or the transformation of rural traditional societies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frisch,  "American urban history as an example of recent historiography." ''History and Theory'' (1979): 350-377. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2504535 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of urbanization focuses on the processes of by which existing populations concentrate themselves in [[Urban area|urban localities]] over time, and on the social, political, cultural and economic contexts of cities. Most urban scholars focus on the "metropolis," a large or especially important city.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Keene, "Ideas of the metropolis," ''Historical Research'' (2011) 84#225 pp 379-398.&lt;/ref&gt; There is much less attention to small cities, towns or (until recently) to suburbs. However social historians find small cities much easier to handle because they can use census data to cover or sample the entire population.  In the United States from the 1920s to the 1990s many of the most influential monographs began as one of the 140 PhD dissertations at Harvard University directed by [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]] (1888-1965) or [[Oscar Handlin]] (1915-2011).&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Stave, ed., ''The Making of Urban History: Historiography through Oral History'' (1977) [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0803908687 in Google]&lt;/ref&gt;  The field grew rapidly after 1970, leading one prominent scholar, [[Stephan Thernstrom]], to note that urban history apparently deals with cities, or with city-dwellers, or with events that transpired in cities, with attitudes toward cities – which makes one wonder what is ''not'' urban history.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mohl, "The History of the American City," in William H. Cartwright and Richard L.  Watson Jr. eds., ''Reinterpretation of American History and Culture'' (1973)  pp 165-205 quote p 165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparative studies==
Only a handful of studies attempt a global history of cities, notably [[Lewis Mumford]], ''[[The City in History]]'' (1961).&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Paul Bairoch]], ''Cities and Economic Development, From the Dawn of History to the Present'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;  Representative comparative studies include Leonardo Benevolo, ''The European City'' (1993);  Christopher R. Friedrichs, ''The Early Modern City, 1450-1750'' (1995), and James L. McClain, John M. Merriman, and Ugawa Kaoru. eds. ''Edo and Paris'' (1994) (Edo was the old name for Tokyo).&lt;ref&gt;They are reviewed in Wolfgang Reinhard, "New Contributions to Comparative Urban History," ''[[Journal of Early Modern History]]'' (1997) 1#2 pp 176-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural history is its own field, but occasionally overlaps with urban history.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Spiro Kostof]], ''The City Shaped: Urban Patterns and Meanings Through History'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

The political role of cities in helping state formation—and in staying independent—is the theme of [[Charles Tilly]] and [[W. P. Blockmans]], eds., ''Cities and the Rise of States in Europe, A.D. 1000 to 1800'' (1994).  Comparative elite studies—who was in power—are typified by Luisa Passerini, Dawn Lyon, Enrica Capussotti and Ioanna Laliotou, eds. ''Who Ran the Cities? City Elites and Urban Power Structures in Europe and North America, 1750-1940'' (2008) .&lt;ref&gt;See also Frederic Cople Jaher, ''The Urban Establishment: Upper Strata in Boston, New York, Charleston, Chicago, and Los Angeles'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;  Labor activists and socialists often had national or international networks that circulated ideas and tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton Stromquist, "'Thinking globally; acting locally': Municipal Labour and Socialist Activism in Comparative Perspective, 1890–1920," ''Labour History Review'' (2009) 74#3 pp 233-256&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies, "The rise of urban history in Britain c. 1960-1978" (PhD dissertation, University of Leicester, 2014) [https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/29036/1/2014daviesgwphd.pdf online, wWillith detailed bibliography pp 205-40]&lt;/ref&gt; Much attention focused first on the Victorian city, with topics ranging from demography, public health, the working-class, and local culture.&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Dyos, and Michael Wolff, eds. ''Victorian City: Images and Realities'' (2 vol. 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, topics regarding class, capitalism, and social structure gave way to studies of the cultural history of urban life, as well as the study of groups such as women, prostitutes, migrants from rural areas, and immigrants from the Continent and from the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Myers and Ian Grosvenor, "Birmingham Stories: Local Histories of Migration and Settlement and the Practice of History." ''Midland History'' (2011) 36#2 pp 149-162&lt;/ref&gt; The urban environment itself became a major topic, as studies of the material fabric of the city, and the structure of urban space, became more prominent.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Gunn, "Urbanization" in Chris Williams, ed., ''Eight Companion to 19th-Century Britain'' (2007) pp 238-252&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have almost always focused on London, but they have also studied small towns and cities from the medieval period, as well as the urbanization that attended the industrial revolution. In the second half of the 19th century, provincial centers such as Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, and Manchester doubled in size, and became regional capitals. They were all conurbations that included smaller cities and suburbs in their [[catchment area]]. Available scholarly materials have become quite comprehensive today.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Palliser,  Peter Clark, and Martin Daunton, eds. ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain'' (3 vol 2000), which reaches down to 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban biography==
Urban biography is the narrative history of a city, and often reaches a general audience. Urban biographies cover the interrelationships among various dimensions, such as politics, demography, business, high culture, popular culture, housing, neighborhoods, and ethnic groups.  It covers [[municipal government]] as well as physical expansion, growth and decline.  Historians often focus on the largest and most dominant city—usually the national capital—which geographers call a "[[primate city]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Garrett Nagle|title=Advanced Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cq9uFL07Y6wC&amp;pg=PA291|year=2000|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some representative urban biographies are:
* [[Edwin G. Burrows]] and [[Mike Wallace (historian)|Mike Wallace]]. ''Gotham: a history of New York City to 1898'' (2000)
* [[S. G. Checkland]], ''The Upas Tree: Glasgow, 1875-1975'' (1981)
* Geoffrey Cotterell, ''Amsterdam, The Life of a City'' (1972)
* [[Janet Abu-Lughod]], ''Cairo; 1001 Years of City Victorious'' (1971)
* Diane E. Davis, ''Urban Leviathan: Mexico City in the Twentieth Century'' (1994)
* [[Christopher Hibbert]], ''London, the Biography of a City'' (1969)
* [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], ''Barcelona'' (1992)
* [[Colin Jones (historian)|Colin Jones]]. ''Paris: Biography of a City'' (2004)
* Blake McKelvey. ''Rochester'' (4 vol, 1961), [[History of Rochester, New York|Rochester NY]]
* [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], ''Jerusalem: The Biography'' (2012)
* [[Bessie Louise Pierce]], ''A History of Chicago'' (3 vol 1957), to 1893.
* [[Roy Porter]], ''London: A Social History'' (1998)
* Alexandra Ritchie, ''Faust's Metropolis: A History of Berlin'' (1998)
* James Scobie, ''Buenos Aires: Plaza to Suburb'' (1974)
* Ronald Taylor, ''Berlin and its Culture: A Historical Portrait'' (1997),  considers literature, music, theater, painting, and decorative arts.

Historians have developed typologies of cities, emphasizing their geographic location and economic specialization. In the United States [[Carl Bridenbaugh]] was a pioneer in the historiography.  He emphasized the major port cities on the East Coast, the largest of which were Boston and Philadelphia, each with fewer than 40,000 people at the time of the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in the Wilderness: The First Century of Urban Life in America, 1625-1742'' (1938), and ''Cities in Revolt: Urban Life in America, 1743-1776'' (1955)&lt;/ref&gt;  Other historians have covered the port cities up and down the East Coast, the Gulf Coast, and the West Coast, along with the river ports along the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri rivers. Industrialization began in New England, and several small cities have scholarly histories. The railroad cities of the West, stretching from Chicago to Kansas City to Wichita to Denver have been well treated. Blake McKelvey provides an encyclopedic overview of the functions of major cities in ''The Urbanization of America, 1860-1915'' (1963), and ''The Emergence of Metropolitan America, 1915-1966'' (1968)

==Large scale reference books==
Peter Clark of the Urban History Center of the University of Leicester was the general editor (and Cambridge University Press the publisher) of a massive history of British cities and towns, running 2800 pages in 75 chapters by 90 scholars.  The chapters deal not with biographies of individual cities, but with economic, social or political themes that cities had in common.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Palliser, ed., ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain, vol. I, 600-1540'' (2000); P. A. Clark, ed., ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain vol. II, 1540-1840''; M. J. Daunton, ed., ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain, vol. III, 1840 1950.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See review by: Albert J. Schmidt, ''Journal of Social History'' (2003) 36#3 pp. 781-784 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3790746 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Two highly influential, authoritative and comprehensive compendia of European urban history were also compiled by Barry Haynes of the Centre for Urban History at Leicester University in 1990 and 1991, published by Leicester University. These books made a significant contribution to the bibliographic review of urban history research and literature in both Eastern and Western Europe.

In the United States a very different approach was sponsored by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] has sponsored large historical encyclopedias for many states and several cities, most notably the [[Encyclopedia of Chicago]] (2004; also online edition) and  [[The Encyclopedia of New York City]] (1995, 2nd ed. 2010) They followed the model of an earlier encyclopedia of Cleveland&lt;ref&gt;David D. Van Tassel and , John J. Brabowski, eds., ''The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and relished the details about neighborhoods, people, organizations and events, without imposing any overall theme.

===Suburbs===
{{main|Suburb}}
A new subgenre is the history of specific suburbs.  Historians have concentrated on specific places, typically focusing on the origins of the suburb in relation to the central city, the pattern of growth, different functions (such as residential or industrial), local politics, as well as racial exclusion and gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth McManus and Philip J. Ethington, "Suburbs in transition: new approaches to suburban history," ''Urban History'' (2007) 34#2 pp 317-337&lt;/ref&gt; The main overview is [[Kenneth T. Jackson]]'s ''[[Crabgrass Frontier]]'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite crabgrass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people have assumed that early-20th-century suburbs were enclaves for middle-class whites, a concept that carries tremendous cultural influence yet is actually stereotypical. Many suburbs are based on a heterogeneous society of working-class and minority residents, many of whom share the [[American Dream]] of upward social status via home ownership. Sies (2001) argues that it is necessary to examine how "suburb" is defined as well as the distinction made between cities and suburbs, geography, economic circumstances, and the interaction of numerous factors that move research beyond acceptance of stereotyping and its influence on scholarly assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Corbin Sies, "North American Suburbs, 1880-1950," ''Journal of Urban History,'' March 2001, Vol. 27 Issue 3, pp 313-46&lt;/ref&gt;

==New urban history==
The "new urban history" emerged in the 1960s as a branch of [[Social history]] seeking to understand the "city as process" and, through quantitative methods, to learn more about the inarticulate masses in the cities, as opposed to the mayors and elites. Much of the attention is devoted to individual behavior, and how the intermingling of classes and ethnic groups operated inside a particular city. Smaller cities are much easier to handle when it comes to tracking a sample of individuals over ten or 20 years.

Common themes include the social and political changes, examinations of class formation, and racial/ethnic tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom and Richard Sennett, eds. ''Nineteenth-century Cities: Essays in the New Urban History'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;   A major early study was Stephan Thernstrom's ''Poverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth Century City'' (1964), which used census records to study [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], 1850-1880. A seminal, landmark book, it sparked interest in the 1960s and 1970s in quantitative methods, census sources,  "bottom-up" history, and the measurement of upward social mobility by different ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frisch, "''Poverty and Progress:'' A Paradoxical Legacy," ''Social Science History,'' Spring 1986, Vol. 10 Issue 1, pp 15-22&lt;/ref&gt;

Other exemplars of the new urban history included
*Kathleen Conzen,  ''Immigrant Milwaukee, 1836-1860'' (1976)
* David F. Crew. '' Town in the Ruhr: A Social History of Bochum, 1860-1914'' (1986)
* Alan Dawley, ''Class and Community: The Industrial Revolution in Lynn'' (1975; 2nd ed. 2000)
* Michael B. Katz,  ''The People of Hamilton, Canada West'' (1976)&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.amazon.com/dp/159740411X excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Eric Henry Monkkonen|Eric H. Monkkonen]], ''The Dangerous Class: Crime and Poverty in Columbus Ohio 1860-1865'' (1975)

There were no overarching social history theories that emerged developed to explain urban development. Inspiration from urban geography and sociology, as well as a concern with workers (as opposed to labor union leaders), families, ethnic groups, racial segregation, and women's roles have proven useful&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, R., 1991. History, geography, and historical geography. Social Science History, 15(2), pp.265-288.&lt;/ref&gt;. Historians now view the contending groups within the city as "agents" who shape the direction of urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Marsh and Lizabeth Cohen. "Old Forms, New Visions: New Directions in United States Urban History," ''Pennsylvania History,'' Winter 1992, Vol. 59 Issue 1, pp 21-28&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-field has flourished in Australia—where most people live in cities.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Frost, and Seamus O'Hanlon, "Urban History and the Future of Australian Cities," ''Australian Economic History Review'' March 2009, Vol. 49 Issue 1, pp 1-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic perspectives make use of the large volume of census data from the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Lampard, ''The Urbanizing World,'' in [[H. J. Dyos]] and Michael Wolff, eds., The Victorian City: Images and Realities, vol. 1 (1973), pp.&amp;nbsp;3–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James H. Jackson, Jr.. "Alltagsgeschichte, Social Science History and the Study of Mundane Movements in 19th-Century Germany," ''Historical Social Research'' (1991) 16#1 pp23-47, explains the value of employment records, marriage contracts, vital records and continuous residency registers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than being strictly areas of geographical segmentation, spatial patterns and concepts of place reveal the struggles for power of various social groups, including gender, class, race, and ethnic identity&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307 &lt;/ref&gt;. The spatial patterns of residential and business areas give individual cities their distinct identities and, considering the social aspects attendant to the patterns, create a more complete picture of how those cities evolved, shaping the lives of their citizens.&lt;ref&gt;James Connolly, "Bringing the City Back in: Space and Place in the Urban History of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era," ''Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era,'' July 2002, Vol. 1 Issue 3, pp 258-278.  The importance of the materiality of specific spaces and places is also treated in Ralph Kingston, "[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/berg/cash/2010/00000007/00000001/art00006 Mind over Matter? History and the Spatial Turn]," ''Cultural and Social History,'' 2010, Vol. 7, Issue 1, pp. 111–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

New techniques include the use of historical [[Geographic information system|GIS]]  data.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Gordon, "Lost in space, or confessions of an accidental geographer,"''[[International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing]]'' (2011) 5#1 pp 1-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Western cities==
Since the 1980s extensive research has been done of the cities of the Ottoman Empire, where standardized record keeping and centralized archives have facilitated work on [[Aleppo]], [[Damascus]], [[Byblos]], [[Sidon]], [[Jericho]], [[Hama]], [[Nablus]] and [[Jerusalem]]. Historians have explored the social bases of political factionalism, histories of elites and commoners, different family structures and gender roles, marginalized groups such as prostitutes and slaves, and relationships between Muslims and Christians and Jews.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Reilly, "Ottoman Syria: Social History Through an Urban Lens," ''History Compass'' (2012) 10#1 pp 70-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly work is underway on African cities,&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Fourchard, "Between World History and State Formation: New Perspectives On Africa's Cities," ''Journal of African History'' (2011) 52#2 pp 223-248.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Burton, ed., ''Urban History in Africa: The Urban Experience in Eastern Africa c. 1750–2000'' (Nairobi: The British Institute in Eastern Africa, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
as well as South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Sharif Uddin Ahmed, ed., ''Dhaka: Past, Present, Future'' (1991) is Bangladesh history from an urban planning perspective&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Heitzman, "Middle Towns to Middle Cities in South Asia, 1800-2007," ''Journal of Urban History'' (2008) 35#1 pp 15-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In China the Maoist ideology privileged the uprising of the peasants as the central force in Chinese history, which led to a neglect of urban history until the 1980s. Academics were then allowed to assert that peasant rebellions were often reactionary rather than revolutionary, and that China's modernizers of the 1870s made significant advances, even if they were capitalists.&lt;ref&gt;David D. Buck "The Study of Urban History in the People's Republic of China," ''Urban History Yearbook'' (1987), pp 61-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Stave, "A Conversation with Zhou Lei: Urban History and Development in Beijing (Peking)," ''Journal of Urban History'' (1988) 14#2 pp 254-68&lt;/ref&gt;

For over a century—since [[Heinrich Schliemann]] searched for and found ancient Troy&lt;ref&gt;David A. Traill, ''Schliemann of Troy: Treasure and Deceit'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;—archaeologists and ancient historians have studies the cities of the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;See  [[Marc van de Mieroop]] ''The Ancient Mesopotamian City.'' (Oxford University Press, 1999) and John Hyslop, ''Inka Settlement Planning''. (U. of Texas Press, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Images and cultural role==
The study of the culture of specific cities and the role of cities in shaping national culture is a more recent development which provides nontraditional ways of "reading" cities. A representative class is Carl E. Schorske, ''Fin-De-Siecle Vienna: Politics and Culture'' (1980).  The basis for some of this approach stems from a [[post-modern]] theory including the cultural anthropology of [[Clifford Geertz]]. One example is Alan Mayne's ''The Imagined Slum: Newspaper Representation in Three Cities, 1870-1914''(1993), a study of how slums were represented in the newspapers in [[Sydney]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Birmingham]]. The accounts provided dramatic life stories but failed to integrate the agendas and animosities of city officials, property owners, residents, and local businessmen.  As a result, they did not reveal the true inner-city social structures.  Nevertheless, the middle class accepted the image of and decided to act on the [[social construction]]s, leading to the reformers' demands for [[slum clearance]] and [[urban renewal]].&lt;ref&gt;See also Alan Mayne, "  Representing The Slum," ''Urban History Yearbook'' (1990), Vol. 17, pp 66-84&lt;/ref&gt;

As Rosen and Tarr point out, environmental history has made great strides since the 1970s, but its focus is primarily on rural areas, leading to a neglect of urban issues such as air pollution, sewage, clean water—and the concentration of large numbers of horses.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Meisn Rosen, and Joel Arthur Tarr, "The importance of an urban perspective in environmental history," ''Journal of Urban History'' (1994) 20#3 pp 299-310&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians are beginning to integrate urban history and environmental history.&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Massard-Guilbaud, and Peter Thorsheim, "Cities, Environments, and European History," ''Journal of Urban History'' (2007) 33#5 pp 691-701, introduces a special issue with case studies from Austria, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus far most of the attention concerns the negative impact on the environment, rather than how the environment shaped the urbanization process.&lt;ref&gt;Lezlie Morinière, "Environmentally Influenced Urbanisation: Footprints Bound for Town?" ''Urban Studies'' (2012) 49#2 pp 435-450, examines 147 studies&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature and philosophy===
In literature the city has long stood as one of the most potent symbols of human capacities and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Schorske, "The Idea of the City in European Thought: Voltaire to Spengler," in ''The Historian and the City'', ed. Oscar Handlin and John Burchard (Harvard U.P., 1963)&lt;/ref&gt; As the largest and most enduring creation of human imagination and hands, and as the largest and most sustained site of human association and interaction, the city has been seen as a marker of what humans are and of what they do. This signification has almost always been shaded with ambivalence. In old legends, epics, and utopias, cities (both actual and symbolic) appeared as places of exceptional but also contradictory meaning. The histories of Troy, Babel, Sodom, Babylon, and Rome were viewed, in Western cultures, as standing for human power, wisdom, creativity, and vision, but also for human presumption, perversion, and fated destruction. Images of the modern city restated this ambivalence with fresh intensity. Great modern cities like London, Paris, Berlin, and New York, have repeatedly been portrayed as sites of opportunity and peril, power and helplessness, vitality and decadence, creativity and perplexity. This contradictory face of the city has appeared so often in Western thought as to suggest an essential psychological and cultural anxiety about human civilization, an anxiety about humanity’s relation to their created world and about "humanity" itself. This is especially true of the “modern” city, filled with human artifice and moral contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;See also Lewis Mumford, "Utopia, The City, and The Machine," ''Daedalus'' (Spring 1965): 271-92; Philip Fisher, "City Matters: City Minds," ''The Worlds of Victorian Fiction'', ed. Jerome Buckley (Cambridge, Mass., 1975); Burton Pike, ''The Image of the City in Modern Literature'' (Princeton, 1981), Marshall Berman, ''All That Is Solid Melts Into Air: The Experience of Modernity'' (New York, 1982); David Harvey, ''Consciousness and the Urban Experience: Studies in the History and Theory of Capitalist Urbanization'' (Baltimore, 1985); Judith Walkowitz, ''City of Dreadful Delight: Narratives of Sexual Danger in Late Victorian London'' (Chicago, 1992); Graeme Gilloch, ''Myth and Metropolis: Walter Benjamin and the City'' (Cambridge, Eng., 1996); Peter Fritzsche, ''Reading Berlin 1900'' (Cambridge, Mass., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
The [[Journal of Urban History]] has been a leading quarterly journal with articles and reviews since 1975. The Urban History Association was founded in 1988 with 284 members; it now has over 400. It sponsored the "Sixth Biennial Urban History Association Conference" in New York, October 25–28, 2012. It awards prizes for the best book prize, best article, and best PhD dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://uha.udayton.edu/ UHA website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312054102/http://uha.udayton.edu/ |date=2015-03-12 }}; its semiannual [http://uha.udayton.edu/news.html newsletters are online]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold James Dyos|H.J. Dyos]]  (1921-1978) at the University of Leicester was the leading promoter of urban history in Britain, leading the way especially into the study of Victorian cities.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Dyos, ''Exploring the Urban Past: Essays in Urban History'' edited by David Cannadine and David Reeder (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;  He formed the Urban History Study Group in 1962; its newsletter became the ''Urban History Yearbook'' (1974-1991) and then the journal ''Urban History'' (1992–present).  His edited volume on ''The Study of Urban History'' (1968) opened up the methodology and stimulated young scholars, as did the conferences he organized and the book series he edited.  Dyos rejected the quantitative methods of the New Urban History because he was not interested in the individual people in the city, but in the larger social structure, such as the slum or the entire city.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour J. Mandelbaum, "H. J. Dyos and British Urban History," ''The Economic History Review'' (1985)  38#3 pp. 437–447, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2596999 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1993, the daily email discussion list '''H-Urban'''  has enabled historians, graduate students and others interested in urban history and urban studies to communicate current research and research interests easily; to query and discuss new approaches, sources, methods, and tools of analysis; and to comment on contemporary historiography. The logs are open to searches, and membership is free. H-Urban seeks to inform historians on such matters as announcements, calls for papers, conferences, awards, fellowships, availability of new sources and archives, reports on new research, and teaching tools, including books, articles, works-in-progress, research reports, primary historical documents (for example, model ordinances, federal/state/local reports, addresses of city officials), syllabi, bibliographies, software, datasets, and multimedia publications or projects. It commissions its own book reviews. H-Urban has 2,856 subscribers (as of 2012) and is the oldest of the H-Net network of discussion lists.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://langinnovate.msu.edu/~urban/ H-Urban website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vasily Alexeyevich Bilbasov''' ({{lang-ru|Василий Алексеевич Бильбасов}}, 19 June 1838, [[Poltava]], [[Ukraine]], then [[Russian Empire]], — 24 July 1904, [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg]], Russian Empire) was a Russian Empire [[historian]], [[editor]] and [[publicist]], the greatest authority on the rule of [[Catherine the Great]] of his time. His magnum opus, the fundamental ''History of Catherine the Second'', published in 1890, and revealing aspects of the great Russian ruler's life that had been hitherto unknown, caused furore, the second volume of it in 1891 was banned. By 1896, two more volumes of the treatise came out, but it remained unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/biograf2/1527/%D0%91%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2 Vasily Bilbasov]. Biography at the Russian Biographical Dictionary, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871-1883 Bilbasov was the editor-in-chief of ''[[Golos (newspaper)|Golos]]'', the influential liberal newspaper in Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{ВТ-ЭСБЕ|Бильбасов, Василий Алексеевич}}&lt;/ref&gt;
