'''''1992''''' is an [[Italian language|Italian]] [[political drama]] television series created by Alessandro Fabbri, Ludovica Rampoldi, Stefano Sardo and based on an idea by [[Stefano Accorsi]]. The first season, comprising ten episodes, premiered on March 24, 2015, on [[pay-tv]] [[Sky Italia]] channels [[Sky Atlantic]] and [[Sky Cinema (Italy)|Sky Cinema 1]].

Set in [[Rome]], [[Milan]] and different [[Italian cities]], the TV series offers a thrilling story following six people whose lives are intertwined with the rapidly changing political landscape in the early 1990s, during which Italy was gripped by the [[Mani Pulite|Clean Hands]] investigation into [[political corruption]]. Subsequently, this led to the end of the "First Republic" as well as the termination of several Italian political parties, who created the Italian democratic system after WWII. This controversial period in Italy resulted in the suicide of various political figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nordicnoir.tv/news/1992-receives-warm-welcome/|title=‘1992’ receives warm welcome|website=Nordic Noir|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was followed by ''[[1993 (TV series)|1993]]''.

The series has been compared to ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', and ''[[The West Wing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mark Jones |author2=Jonathan Wright |author3=John Robinson |author4=Graeme Virtue |author5=Hannah J Davies |author6=Andrew Mueller |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/mar/24/teens-dara-and-eds-great-big-adventure-1992|title=Tuesday’s best TV|website=The Guardian|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =Peter White|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/sky-arts-acquires-italian-political-thriller/5082751.article|title=Sky Arts acquires Italian political thriller|website=Broadcast Now|accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series synopses==

===Season 1 (2015)===
In 1992, prosecutors in [[Milan]] launch the ''[[mani pulite]]'' investigation into [[political corruption in Italy]]. Leonardo Notte ([[Stefano Accorsi]]), a slick, self-serving advertising man who believes only in himself, schemes to profit from the unraveling scandal. Caught up in the investigation is Michele Mainaghi (Tommaso Ragno), a Milanese pharmaceutical magnate whose firm sold tainted blood that infected young police officer Luca Pastore (Domenico Diele) with [[HIV]]. Pastore, part of [[Antonio di Pietro]]'s investigative team, seeks revenge and teams up with Rocco Venturi (Alessandro Roja), another cop with a dark side. Meanwhile, Mainaghi's mistress, Veronica Castello ([[Miriam Leone]]), seeks out a career in television and returns to Notte after Mainaghi is disgraced. Upstanding [[Gulf War]] veteran Pietro Bosco ([[Guido Caprino]]) leaps into a fight and saves the life of a man who turns out to be one of the leaders of the new party [[Lega Nord]], quickly finding himself one of the party's parliamentary candidates. Veronica, initially intending to use him boost her TV career, instead falls in love with him; the two begin planning a life together. However, Pietro finds that he has to betray his friends and convictions if he wants to continue his political career and, most of all, build a family with Veronica.

==Main cast and characters==
* '''[[Stefano Accorsi]]''' as ''Leonardo Notte'', a marketing man with a murky past, coming back to haunt him just as 1992’s events seem to bring about the professional chance of a lifetime. Anonymous blackmail forces Leo to confront a morbid episode in his past that he had surgically removed from his memory. His glitzy, no-strings-attached lifestyle is turned upside down by the appearance of Viola, his hitherto unknown teenage daughter. As Leo tries to free himself from the shadows of the past, he stumbles into a revolutionary idea that could shape the future of his trade - and his own.
* '''[[Guido Caprino]]''' as ''Pietro Bosco'', a 33-year-old veteran of the [[Gulf war]], finds himself elected in the Italian parliament, with the rising [[Lega Nord]] party. A gregarious rugby lover and beer drinker, he turns out to be the ultimate fish out of water in the political sphere. His only chances lie in finding the right mentor; thus, Pietro will put his career in the hands of a seasoned politician who will show him the ropes - certainly, at a price.
* '''[[Domenico Diele]]''' as ''Luca Pastore'', a judicial police officer, works side by side with maverick prosecutor [[Antonio Di Pietro]]. Motivated by a personal quest for revenge, he is hard at work to solve the [[Tangentopoli]] conundrum. Investigations, arrests, interrogations. Under pressure and under menace. Because strong headwinds are blowing, and not just from outside the prosecutors’ offices.
* '''[[Tea Falco]]''' as ''Beatrice "Bibi" Mainaghi''. Daughter of the aforementioned tycoon, is the black sheep in a power dynasty, but her life will take a new, radically unexpected turn in the wake of Tangentopoli.
* '''[[Miriam Leone]]''' as ''Veronica Castello'', a showgirl on the fast track to fame. She needs it, physically, and is out to get it at all costs: the unconditional love of a prime time audience is the only viable conduit for her self-esteem. As the lover she has picked, powerful tycoon Michele Mainaghi, goes under in the investigations, Veronica briefly finds herself at a loss, then starts the search for a new, powerful pigmalione t position in the pecking order of the new powers that be.
* '''[[Alessandro Roja]]''' as ''Rocco Venturi'', a young Roman police officer, also joining Antonio Di Pietro’s team of investigators. A sly look and his trademark fast talk would seem to put him as a natural leader in that team, but he will turn out to hide a totally different truth behind his gung-ho mask.

Other characters:
* '''[[Irene Casagrande]]''' as ''Viola Notte''
* '''[[Teco Celio]]''' as ''Gianni Bortolotti''
* '''[[Fabrizio Contri]]''' as ''[[Marcello Dell'Utri]]''

* '''[[Gianfelice Imparato]]''' as ''Gaetano Nobile''
* '''[[Bebo Storti]]''' as ''Enrico Lodato''

The '''Andorran diner''' (ADD) is a [[Commemorative coins of Andorra|commemorative currency]] issued in form of [[coin]]s intended for collectors and without a legal tender value. A diner is divided into 100 cèntims. The name ''diner'' (money in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is derived from the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] [[currency]] ''[[denarius]]''.

The Servei d'Emissions de la Vegueria Episcopal has issued from 1977 onwards various series of diner denominated coins. Previously there were minor privately issued diner coinage (with no legal value). There have been silver, golder and bimetallic issues. The most commemorated topic is [[Charlemagne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbcc-online.com/ctrys-a/andorra.html Worldwide Bi-Metallic Collectors Club: Andorran diner]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[exchange rate]] was defined (informally) as 100 [[Spanish peseta|ESP]] (0.60 EUR) or 5 FRF (~125 ESP or 0.75 EUR) to one diner. But there is no bank or other authority where visitors to Andorra can change diners for [[euro]]s. It is only an informal relation. It is not possible to buy anything with diners in [[Andorra]]. It is not possible to open an account in diners. It is only an artificial currency to produce commemorative coins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downies.com/Euro-Collections/Andorra/133/catmenu.aspx Euro Collections International Andorra Coins and Coin Sets] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101051141/http://www.downies.com/Euro-Collections/Andorra/133/catmenu.aspx |date=November 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the [[General Council of the Valleys]] issued for the first time a series of diner denominated coins to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the ''[[Manual Digest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omnicoin.com/country/Andorra Some later uses of andorran diner]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boka''' is a waterfall in the western part of Slovenia, near the [[Soča]] River. It begins at a [[karst]] spring and has two stages, of which the first is {{convert|106|m|sp=us}} high&lt;ref name="KunaverES"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Kunaver, Jurij|url= |title=Boka|work=[[Enciklopedija Slovenije]] |volume=1 (A-Ca)  | publisher=Mladinska knjiga| location=Ljubljana | date=1987 |pages=314–315 |isbn= | access-date= }}   {{OCLC|468393318}} {{COBISS|ID=17411}} {{ISBN|86-11-14288-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skoberne, Peter. 1997. "Slap." ''Encliklopedija Slovenije'', vol. 11, pp. 123–124. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RoughGuideSlovenia" /&gt; and {{convert|18|m|sp=us}} wide, and the second is {{convert|33|m|sp=us}} high.&lt;ref name="KunaverES" /&gt;

== Overview ==
The waterfall is supplied by a [[karst spring]]&lt;ref name="KunaverES" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kunaver, Jurij. 1990. "Kanin." ''Encliklopedija Slovenije'', vol. 4, pp. 395–396. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt; under an almost vertical [[limestone]] wall. Because of its karst nature, the spring has a relatively large discharge due to its underground drainage in the mountains of [[Kanin Mountains|Kanin]]. During the driest periods, water flux is around {{convert|2|m3/s|sp=us}}, and reaches up to {{convert|100|m3/s|sp=us}} after extensive rains.&lt;ref name="KunaverES" /&gt; The stream (also called Boka) flows for about {{convert|30|m|sp=us}} over a rocky shelf before falling over the rocks as a spectacular waterfall. This happens in two not so clearly separated stages, of which the upper one has a height of {{convert|106|m|sp=us}}, and the lower one {{convert|33|m|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="KunaverES" /&gt; The width of the two stages is around {{convert|18|m|sp=us}}.

Below the waterfall, Boka Creek flows over a steep valley with stony bottom and empties into the [[Soča]] River after less than {{convert|1|km|sp=us}}, which makes it one of the shortest streams in [[Slovenia]].

== Access ==
The waterfall is located on the right bank of the Soča River, about {{convert|1.3|km|sp=us}} from the river. The starting point to visit the waterfall is on the regional road between [[Kobarid]] and [[Bovec]], about {{convert|2.2|km|sp=us}} upstream from the village of [[Žaga, Bovec|Žaga]]  or {{convert|6.1|km|sp=us}} downstream from the town of [[Bovec]]. The waterfall is visible from this road, especially its upper part. Next to the road and Boka Creek, there is a parking lot, and a gravel road leads uphill towards the waterfall. After about {{convert|100|m|sp=us}}, this road splits into path over the stream on the left, which transitions to a secured climbing path leading to the source of the waterfall, and into the path on the right that leads to the waterfall.&lt;ref name="RoughGuideSlovenia"&gt;{{cite book | author=Rough Guides | url=https://books.google.lu/books?id=YNlLDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT187&amp;dq=Boka&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=Boka&amp;f=false | title=The Rough Guide to Slovenia | pages=142 | work= | publisher=Rough Guides UK | date=Jun 1, 2017 | isbn= | archive-url=https://archive.is/20170722113721/https://books.google.lu/books?id=YNlLDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover%23v=onepage&amp;q=Boka&amp;f=false#v=snippet&amp;q=Boka&amp;f=false | archive-date=2017-07-22 | access-date=2017-07-05 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StewartSlovenia"&gt;{{cite book | author=James Stewart | url=https://books.google.lu/books?id=qwBUkHaz76QC | title=Slovenia | pages=110 | work=Cadogan Guides | publisher=New Holland Publishers | date=2006 | isbn= | archive-url=https://archive.is/20170722114545/https://books.google.lu/books?id=qwBUkHaz76QC&amp;q=boka%23v=snippet&amp;q=boka&amp;f=false | archive-date=2017-07-22 | access-date=2017-07-05 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"C'est peut-être pas l'Amérique"''' ([[English language|English]] translation: "It May Not Be America") was the [[Luxembourg]]ish entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1981]], performed in [[French language|French]] by [[France|French]] singer [[Jean-Claude Pascal]]. Pascal, along with Luxembourg/France's [[Anne Marie David]], Israel's [[Izhar Cohen]], Ireland's [[Johnny Logan (singer)|Johnny Logan]] and Sweden's [[Charlotte Perrelli]], was one of the very few Eurovision winners to return to the Contest since its inception some five decades ago; he had won in 1961 for Luxembourg singing "[[Nous les amoureux]]".

"C'est peut-être pas l'Amérique" is in praise of [[Europe]] and its lifestyle, with Pascal singing that "America isn't everything" and explaining that he prefers the winds of southern [[France]] and the music he hears there. Pascal also recorded the song in German, entitled "Heut' ist vieles sehr amerikanisch" ("Today most things are very American").

The song was performed fourth on the night (following [[Germany]]'s [[Lena Valaitis]] with "[[Johnny Blue]]" and preceding [[Israel]]'s [[Hakol Over Habibi]] with "[[Halayla]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 41 points, placing 11th in a field of 20.

It was succeeded as [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourgish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982 Contest]] by [[Svetlana (singer)|Svetlana]] with "[[Cours après le temps]]". Jean-Claude Pascal died in 1992.

The '''Catholic Church in Hungary''' ({{lang-hu|Magyar Katolikus Egyház}}) is part of the worldwide [[Catholic Church]], under the spiritual leadership of the [[Pope]] in [[Rome]].

There are around 3.842 million Catholics in [[Hungary]] — or 39% of the population (2011 census).  The country is divided into 12 dioceses including 4 archdioceses. In addition, there is a [[territorial abbey]] and a separate [[sui juris]] [[particular Church]] for those who adhere to the [[Byzantine Rite]] known as the [[Hungarian Greek Catholic Church]].

The Church has been in decline in recent decades in Hungary; although the decline has not been as dramatic as in the [[Religion in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], it is nowadays only a plurality (the largest minority) in the country.

The '''coat of arms of [[Holmestrand]]''' was approved by Royal Resolution on 14 November 1898.&lt;ref name="kommune.no"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holmestrand.kommune.no/Artikkel.aspx?AId=708&amp;back=1&amp;MId1=45&amp;MId2=&amp;MId3=&amp;|title=Kommunevåpen|publisher=Holmestrand kommune|accessdate=2012-02-19|language=no|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804234008/http://www.holmestrand.kommune.no/Artikkel.aspx?AId=708&amp;back=1&amp;MId1=45&amp;MId2=&amp;MId3=&amp;|archivedate=2012-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by the artist Andreas Bloch (1860-1917).&lt;ref name="kommune.no"/&gt; It among other things points to the towns connections with the naval hero [[Peter Tordenskjold]] (in the middle of the white eagle is a picture of his ship ''Hvide Ørn'' 'white eagle').&lt;ref name="kommune.no"/&gt; The official version of the coat of arms also features a golden [[mural crown]] with three towers.&lt;ref name="kommune.no"/&gt;


==Blasoning==
Norwegian: ''På rød bunn en sølv, flakt ørn som i høyre klo holder et gull anker og i venstre en gull æskulapstav. I blått hjerteskjold en sølv fregatt.''

'''European studies''' is a field of study offered by many academic [[college]]s and [[university|universities]] that focuses on current developments in [[European integration]].

Some programmes offer a social science or public administration curriculum focusing on developments in the European Union. These programmes usually include a combination of political science, EU public policy, [[European history]], [[European law]], [[economics]] and [[sociology]]. Other universities approach the subject in a broader manner, including topics like [[European culture]], [[European literature]] and [[European languages]]. While all programmes focus on the study of the European Union, they often cover national topics (in a comparative perspective) as well.

The subject combines [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. Disciplines that are involved in European studies include:

'''Europort Avenue''' is an avenue in the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. It is built on reclaimed land and buildings include [[McDonald's|McDonald's fast food]], [[Morrisons|Morrisons supermarket]] and [[St Bernard's Hospital]]. At one end is a roundabout that features a sculpture by [[Jill Cowie Sanders]] of a larger than lifesize family being reunited. It was unveiled in 2000 to commemorate the sacrifice made by the people of Gibraltar when they were [[Evacuation of the Gibraltarian civilian population during World War II|evacuated during the Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/press_releases/2000/165-2000.htm GIBRALTAR EVACUATION MONUMENT], Gibraltar Government, 2000, accessed 2 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of Podgorica.svg|thumb|Flag of Podgorica]]

The '''Flag of Podgorica''', along with its [[Coat of arms of Podgorica|coat of arms]], is a symbol of [[Podgorica]], capital of [[Montenegro]]. It is a new city flag, adopted as a symbol of the city in 2006. It is derived from a detail on a new coat of arms. The author is Srđan Marlović.
 
The layers of urban heritage in this municipality ([[Duklja (town)|Doclea]] and [[Medun|Meteon]]) were presented by two blue horizontal stripes. Metaphorically, they present the foundation of the present city of Podgorica. 

The universal symbol, whose creation was based on stylisation of all recognisable symbols of modern Podgorica that we know today: Nemanja's town, Clock tower, Gorica monument, Gates, Bridges....all those sights were united in one symbol, broken line that was positioned above 2 horizontal stripes.

[[File:Green Ensign 1707 Canton.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|Possible version of the Green Ensign with the flag of Great Britain in the canton]]
The '''Green Ensign''' ({{Lang-ga|An Meirge Uaine}}) is a historical [[flag]] flown by some [[Ireland|Irish]] [[merchant vessel]]s from the 17th century to the early 20th century. The flag consists of a green field with a golden harp and a canton containing either the English Flag ([[St George's Cross]]) or a version of the [[Union Jack]].

This flag has appeared in these historical flag plates:
*1685 Downham's Flag Chart
*1700 Len's Flag Chart
*1772 [[:File:Encyclopedie volume 6-145.png|French ''Encyclopédie'']]
*1783 [[:File:Naval flags of the World 1783 (small).jpg|Bowles's Universal Display of the Naval Flags of all Nations]]

*1889 Drawings of Flags of All Nations - British Admiralty
*1917 National Geographic Flag Book

There remains a lively debate concerning whether the flag had any form of local official status within the British Isles or was simply an informal flag used by some merchant ships.

'''Gwen Fenton''' is Chief Scientist of the [[Australian Antarctic Division]] and is the first woman to hold this position.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-11/dr-gwen-fenton-becomes-aads-first-female-chief-scientist/7022536|title=Gwen Fenton becomes AAD's first female chief scientist|date=2015-12-11|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/news/2015/antarctic-division-appoints-first-female-chief-scientist|title=Antarctic Division appoints first female Chief Scientist|last=|first=|date=|website=antarctica.gov.au|publisher=Australian Antarctic Division|language=en-au|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She discovered that the fish species, the [[Orange roughy]], can live to over 100 years old, leading to significant management changes of the species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/magazine/2016-2020/issue-30-june-2016/people/career-challenges-shape-new-chief-scientist|title=Career challenges shape new Chief Scientist|website=www.antarctica.gov.au|language=en-au|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Fenton grew up in Australia, the daughter of a zoologist and cosmic ray and aurora physicist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She completed a science degree with Honours at the [[University of Tasmania]] on coastal krill from south-eastern Australia and southern New Zealand. She continued her work at the University of Tasmania as part of a PhD focused on [[mysid|mysid crustaceans]], discovering three new genera and 12 new species, graduating in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.utas.edu.au/19936/7/whole_FentonGwenElizabeth1985_thesis_ex_pub_mat.pdf|title=Ecology and taxonomy of mysids (mysidacea : crustacea)|last=|first=|date=1985|website=|publisher=University of Tasmania|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and impact==
Fenton’s post-doctoral work at the University of Tasmania resulted in the development of a technique to age fish based on the radioactive decay of radium-226 to lead-210.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://frdc.com.au/knowledge/seafood_marketing/Documents/FRDC_Rep_92_41_Fenton.pdf|title=Age determination of oreo dory species by radiometric analysis|last=|first=|date=1996|website=frdc.com.au/|publisher=University of Tasmania|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revolutionized the understanding of the age of the important fishery species, orange roughy. Her work revealed that this species is extremely slow-growing, not maturing until between 20 and 25 years of age, with significant implications for sustainable management of catch limits for the species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecosmagazine.com/?act=view_file&amp;file_id=EC68p13.pdf|title=Methuselah of the deep|last=|first=|date=1991|website=ecosmagazine.com|publisher=Ecos|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenton joined the Tasmanian Government in marine environmental management and policy development in 1996. In her role she developed environmental monitoring programs for Tasmanian salmon farms, developed ballast water policy and provided  advice on marine infrastructure developments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2003 she joined the Australian Antarctic Division as the Manager of Science Planning and Coordination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2015  Fenton became the first female Chief Scientist of the Australian Antarctic Division.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her role includes reviewing the Antarctic Science Strategic Plan and strengthening collaborations with East Antarctic partners such as China, India, Japan and France. She will also be working to ensure that the science program is ready to take advantage of the expanded capability that will come with the launch of Australia’s new [[icebreaker]] in 2020.

A '''lugat''' or '''liogat''' is a [[vampire]]-like being in [[Albanian mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of Albanian Religion, Mythology, and Folk Culture|last=Elsie|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Elsie|year=2001|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=9780814722145}}&lt;/ref&gt; They abide in shadows and darkness, especially places that never see sunlight, such as inside water wells, old ruins, and caves. They have a frightening visage and are extremely violent. A lugat can fly and ride the winds, and assails his victims in their sleep. He also lures people, especially children, to himself while he is concealed in darkness. &lt;!-- In Albanian saying someone is a lugat, is saying that this person is nefarious. {{citation needed|date=January 2016}} --&gt;

'''Magnetic Band''' was an [[Estonia]]n [[Heavy metal music|metal-rock]] and [[jazz-rock]] band.

==History==
Magnetic Band was formed in 1976 by [[Gunnar Graps]]. They played [[jazz-rock]], which had influences of [[reggae]] and [[funk]]-[[Soul music|soul]]. Later, after Graps graduated from [[Tallinn]] music school (in 1977), Magnetic Band was reformed and started to play metal-rock as well. Magnetic Band soon became one of the most popular heavy-music bands in [[Soviet Union]].

In 1980 Magnetic Band got first prize in the [[Tbilisi Rock Festival (1980)]]. They performed a mixture of jazz-rock, blues and funk and was noted for their instrumental mastership.

In 1982, the [[Washington Post]] dedicated a whole page to Gunnar Graps and the Magnetic Band. In 1983, Magnetic Band got banned by Soviet authorities and was renamed to [[Gunnar Graps Group]] (GGG). GGG performed in Estonia and Soviet Union and was very popular until the end of decade.

They performed until 1989. In 1997, the GGG reunited, although they performed only about once a month.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="874">'''Matsieng''' is a [[Setswana]] traditional music trio formed in 2005 in [[Gaborone]] [[Botswana]]. They burst into the scene with their 2005 festive season album, [[Semakaleng]]. Known for their explicit lyrics, the trio has toured Botswana, [[Malaysia]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Botswana: Matsieng Bounces Back|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200707100433.html|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their latest album, Setswana Sa Borre, has topped charts locally and enjoys airplay in the neighbouring [[South Africa]], driven by their most explicit song, [[Tinto song]][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQpzckYM7vc]. Two of the boys are natives of [[Gabane]] and one is from [[Kanye,_Botswana|Kanye]].

''The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] provides an overview of, and topical guide to, the [[Norway|Kingdom of Norway]].''

'''Norway''' is a [[List of sovereign states|sovereign]] [[constitutional monarchy]], located principally in the western part of [[Scandinavia]] in [[Northern Europe]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=July 2, 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/no.html|title=Norway|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has land borders with [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], and [[Russia]], while the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Faroe Islands]] lie to its west across the [[North Sea]] and [[Denmark]] to its south across the [[Skagerrak]] strait. The country's long and glaciated [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coastline is deeply indented by [[fjord]]s, rising precipitously to high [[plateau]]x.

Norway also includes the [[Arctic]] island territories of [[Svalbard]] and [[Jan Mayen]]. Norwegian [[sovereignty]] over Svalbard is based upon the [[Spitsbergen Treaty]], but that treaty does not apply to Jan Mayen. [[Bouvet Island]] in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Peter I Island]] and [[Queen Maud Land]] in [[Antarctica]] are external [[Dependent territory|dependencies]], but those three entities do not form part of the kingdom.

Since [[World War II]], Norway has experienced rapid economic growth, and is now amongst the wealthiest countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of countries by current account balance]]&lt;/ref&gt; Norway is the world's third largest oil exporter after [[Russia]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[petroleum industry]] accounts for around a quarter of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKL0674675920070906 UPDATE 1-Statistics Norway raises '07 GDP outlook, cuts '08]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also rich resources of gas fields, hydropower, [[fish]], forests, and minerals. Norway was the second largest exporter of seafood (in value, after China) in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globefish.org/filedownload.php?fileId=560 FAO Globefish global trends 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Other main industries include food processing, shipbuilding, metals, chemicals, mining and pulp and paper products. Norway has a [[Social welfare provision|Scandinavian welfare system]] and the largest capital reserve per capita of any nation.

Norway was ranked highest of all countries in [[Human Development Index|human development]] from 2001 to 2006, and came second in 2007 (to fellow [[Nordic countries|Nordic country]] [[Iceland]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Development Index]]. Note that although Norway and Iceland's scores are the same to three decimal places, Iceland ranks higher when the decimal is expanded.&lt;/ref&gt; It also rated the most peaceful country in the world in a 2007 survey by [[Global Peace Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/6704767.stm | work=BBC News | title=Norway rated most peaceful nation | date=May 30, 2007 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a founding member of [[NATO]].

{{Politics of Somaliland}}
The '''Parliament of Somaliland''' consists of two chambers:

*The '''[[House of Elders of Somaliland|House of Elders]]''' ([[upper chamber|Upper Chamber]])
*The '''[[House of Representatives of Somaliland|House of Representatives]]''' ([[lower chamber|Lower Chamber]])

The current speakership position was established in the 1990s, following the formation of the [[Somaliland]] polity. Since August 2017 [[Bashe Mohamed Farah]] is the Speaker of the House of Representatives of [[Somaliland]], replacing [[Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.garoweonline.com/en/news/somaliland/somaliland-parliament-picks-bashe-mohamed-a-new-speaker&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Pvtacil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational-somaliland.com/2017/08/06/bashe-mohamed-farah-elected-speaker-somalilands-house-representatives/|title=Bashe Mohamed Farah elected speaker of Somaliland's House of Representatives|last=|first=|date=06-08-2017|website=|publisher=The National Somaliland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also serves as the chairman of the Waddani Party, which is one of the three political parties in the Somaliland region.

Somaliland is expected to hold parliamentary elections in March 27, 2017. These elections are expected to replace the 10 year parliament which had been sitting since 2005. 

The 2005 parliament was elected by universal mandate of registered voters, and with the current registration drive for 2017 nearing completion, the voter rolls are expected to exceed those of 2005.

The '''Polish Round Table Talks''' took place in [[Warsaw]], Poland from 6 February to 5 April&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jii/4750978.0006.301?rgn=main;view=fulltext The 1989 Polish Round Table Revisited: Making History. Brian Porter 1999]
&lt;/ref&gt; 1989. The government initiated the discussion with the banned trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarność]] and other opposition groups in an attempt to defuse growing social unrest.

==History==
{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2015}}
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}
Following the factory strikes of the early 1980s and the subsequent formation of the (then still underground) Solidarity movement under the leadership of [[Lech Wałęsa]], the political situation in Poland started relaxing somewhat. Despite an attempt by the government to crack down on [[trade unionism]], the movement had gained too much momentum and it became impossible to hold off change anymore. In addition there was fear of a social explosion due to economic malaise and [[runaway inflation]] that had depressed Polish living standards and deepened public anger and frustration. By 1988 the authorities began serious talks with the opposition.

In September 1988, when a [[1988 Polish strikes|wave of strikes]] was coming to an end, a secret meeting was held which included Lech Wałęsa and [[Minister of Internal Affairs]] [[Czesław Kiszczak]]. They agreed on holding the so-called "Round Table" talks in the near future to plan out the course of action to be undertaken in the country. The Round Table talks began on 6 February 1989 at 2:23&amp;nbsp;pm CET. They included the ''solidarity opposition faction'' and the ''coalition government faction''. The talks were held in the Council of Ministers Office. The meetings were co-chaired by Wałęsa and Kiszczak.

The Polish communists, led by [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|General Jaruzelski]], hoped to co-opt prominent opposition leaders into the ruling group without making major changes in the political power structure. In reality, the talks radically altered the shape of the Polish government and society. The events in Poland precipitated and gave momentum to the fall of the entire European [[communist bloc]]; the [[Yalta arrangement]] collapsed soon after the events in Poland.

==Sessions==
The sessions were divided into three main work groups:
*Political reform workgroup
*[[Union pluralism]] and party [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] workgroup
*Economy and social issues workgroup

Specific issues were handled by these work groups, although meetings often ground to a halt. This was caused by a mutual distrust of the factions and an obvious unwillingness of the government faction to relinquish power. The most controversial questions were:
*Pay raises and indexation
*Future pluralist elections
*The limit of the future president's competence
*The limit of competence for the future [[Sejm]] and [[Senate of Poland|Senate]]
*The access to [[mass media|mass communication media]] by opposition forces

A number of (radical) opposition organisations were quite opposed to the talks as they did not believe in the good intentions of the sitting government. Despite their fears a number of important documents were signed on 5 April, at the conclusion of the sessions. These documents became known as the Round Table Agreement.

==Results==
An agreement ("Round Table Agreement") was signed on 4 April 1989. The most important demands, including those reflected in the [[April Novelization]], were:
*Legalization of independent trade unions
*The introduction of the office of President (thereby annulling the power of the Communist party general secretary), who would be elected to a 6-year term
*The formation of a Senate

As a result, real political power was vested in a newly created [[bicameral legislature]] and in a president who would be the chief executive. Solidarność became a legitimate and legal political party. Free election to 35% of the seats in Sejm and an entirely free election to the [[Senate]] was assured.

The [[Contract Sejm|election of 4 June 1989]] brought a landslide victory to Solidarność: 99% of all the seats in the Senate and all of the 35% possible seats in Sejm. Jaruzelski, whose name was the only one the [[Communist Party]] allowed on the ballot for the presidency, won by just one vote in the National Assembly. The 65–35 division was soon abolished as well, after the first truly free Sejm elections.

The Round Table sessions were of momentous importance to the future political developments in Poland. They paved the way to a free and democratic Poland as well as the final abolition of communism in Poland.

==Criticism==
[[Image:Okragły Stół Pałac Prezydencki w Warszawie 05.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Original table displayed in [[Presidential Palace, Warsaw|Presidential Palace in Warsaw]]]]
[[Andrzej Gwiazda]], who was one of the leaders of the so-called ''First Solidarity'' (August 1980 – December 1981), claims that the Round Table Agreement and the negotiations that took place before it at a Communist government's [[Ministry of the Interior and Administration (Poland)]] conference center (late 1988 and early 1989) in the village of [[Magdalenka, Masovian Voivodeship|Magdalenka]] had been arranged by Moscow. According to Gwiazda, who himself did not take part in the negotiations, the Soviets "carefully selected a group of opposition activists, who passed on as representatives of the whole [Polish] society, and made a deal with them".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.se.pl/wydarzenia/kraj/okragy-sto-zosta-zaplanowany-w-moskwie_94674.html Okrągły Stół został zaplanowany w Moskwie, interview with Andrzej Gwiazda, Super Express, 08.04.2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

This notion was supported by [[Anna Walentynowicz]], who in an interview given in 2005 stated that the Agreement was a "success of the Communists, not of the nation". According to Walentynowicz, [[Czesław Kiszczak]] and [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who initiated the negotiations, "safeguarded their own safety and (...) influence on the government". Walentynowicz claims that the talks were organized so that in the future, "no Communist criminal, murderer or thief would pay for their crimes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.se.pl/wydarzenia/kraj/okragy-sto-by-sukcesem-komunistow-nie-spoeczenstwa_88698.html Okrągły Stół był sukcesem komunistów, nie społeczeństwa, interview with Anna Walentynowicz, Super Express, 05.02.2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antoni Macierewicz]] regards the negotiations and the agreement as a "classic Soviet plot of the secret services". In his opinion, both Kiszczak and Jaruzelski were "at every stage controlled by their Soviet overseers (...) and their autonomy was minimal". As Macierewicz said in February 2009, the Round Table was a "tactical success of the parts of the elites, but from the point of view of national interests of Poland, it was a failure".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gover.pl/news/szczegoly/guid/macierewicz-okragly-stol-to-przegrana Gover.pl, Polityka w sieci. Macierewicz: Okrągły Stół to przegrana, 06.-2.2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200636/http://www.gover.pl/news/szczegoly/guid/macierewicz-okragly-stol-to-przegrana |date=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piotr Bączek of [[Gazeta Polska]] weekly wrote that in the mid-1980s, the so-called Communist ''Team of three'' ([[Jerzy Urban]], General [[Władysław Pożoga]] and [[Stanisław Ciosek]]), suggested that among opposition activists, "search for people, who are politically available" should be initiated, as "yesterday's opponent, drawn into the power, becomes a zealous ally".&lt;ref&gt;[http://niezalezna.pl/11539-4-czerwca-1989-r-jak-majstrowano-okragly-stol 4 czerwca 1989 r. – jak majstrowano Okrągły Stół by niezalezna.pl, 2011-06-04]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1987 [[Mieczysław Rakowski]], in a report handed to General Jaruzelski, wrote that a "change in the attitude towards the opposition must be initiated (...) Maybe, out of numerous oppositional fractions, one movement would be selected and allowed to participate in the governing", wrote Rakowski. Bączek's opinion is backed by Filip Musiał, a historian of Kraków's office of [[Institute of National Remembrance]]. In June 2008 Musiał stated that the ''Team of three'' was ordered to find a solution to a problem, which troubled Communist government of Poland. Economic situation of the country was worsening in the late 1980s, and the threat of social unrest was real. At the same time, the Communists did not want to relinquish power, so they prepared, in Musiał's words, "a political marketing operation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fakty.interia.pl/prasa/tygodnik_solidarnosc/news/operacja-okraglego-stolu,1122671,3406 Operacja "okrągłego stołu", interview with Filip Musiał, interia.pl, June 5, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613055913/http://fakty.interia.pl/prasa/tygodnik_solidarnosc/news/operacja-okraglego-stolu%2C1122671%2C3406 |date=June 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musiał says that General Czesław Kiszczak himself decided which oppositional activists were "politically available" – the condition was that the candidates had to be supportive of "evolution" of the system, not its "radical rejection". Therefore, most opposition activists, who took part in the negotiations, were those who at different points of their lives were close to the "Marxist doctrine" or belonged to the Communist party. Furthermore, all participants were carefully scrutinized by the secret services. As a result, Poland was "the first Eastern Europe country, in which talks were initiated, but the last, in which completely free elections were organized, in the fall of 1991". [[Janusz Korwin-Mikke]] claims that one of the results of the Round Table agreement was that both sides pledged that "right-wing parties would never be allowed to rule",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fronda.pl/news/czytaj/tytul/korwin-mikke:_partie_prawicowe_ofiarami_pkw_15409 Korwin-Mikke: Partie prawicowe ofiarami PKW, fronda.pl, September 13, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jan Olszewski]] said that "basic issues had been settled before [the talks], and the negotiations at the Round Table were about secondary matters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://salski.nowyekran.pl/post/16524,legenda-okraglego-stolu-klamstwem-zalozycielskim-iii-rp by Andy-aandy, June 3, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radio Lagos 107.5 FM''' (also known as Tiwa n' Tiwa) began operations in 1977 as an offshoot of the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation. It is the first [[state-owned]] [[Frequency modulation|FM]] [[List of radio stations in Lagos|radio station]] in [[Lagos State]]

The station originally operated on two A.M. Frequencies (990&amp;nbsp;kHz.303mtrs and 918&amp;nbsp;kHz.327mtrs). The need for transformation produced Radio Lagos 107.5 FM (Tiwa n'Tiwa) under the control of the Lagos State Radio Service in 2001.

Radio Lagos is the first predominantly specialized, language station with over 98% of its transmission in [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and Egun, and approximately 2% for [[English language|English]] bulletins. The station target audience includes Yoruba speaking listeners in [[Lagos]] and [[Nigerian diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=RadioAfrican|title=Radio Lagos 107.5 Online|author=Haris Aslam|date=20 November 2014|url=http://www.radioafrican.com/radio-lagos-107-5-fm-online/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12317">'''Sales outsourcing''' is a way for companies to attract increased, high volumes of sales for their products or services by using a third party. The company typically uses outsourcing companies to improve sales volumes without links to the sales teams that carry out those campaigns. The company that undertakes the outsourcing will normally be paid based on the results they are able to generate, and therefore creates a mutually beneficial situation for both client and the outsourcing company. 

== Background ==
Full 'sales outsourcing' is observed when companies have an external third party [[sales]] force. It is differentiated from [[Value-added re seller|value added reselling]] or [[Distributor (business)|distribution]] in that the [[business model]] can be based on shared risk, although there are models where the outsourcer is paid for all of their activity - just as with a hired [[direct sales]] force, but the outsourcer provides rapidity, flexibility and experience. 
Other names for sales outsourcing include 'indirect sales' and 'channel sales'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=E|title=Outsourcing the sales function: The real cost of field sales|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/South-western|location=Mason, Ohio|author2=Trickle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Full sales outsourcing is different from [[telemarketing]] in that it requires direct recruitment of sales personnel with specific backgrounds for each sales campaign. Usually the sales executives will be part of a team that may include telemarketing, [[marketing]], tools systems and methodologies as well as [[sales management]].

Sales [[outsourcing]] firms provide [[accountability]] regarding all sales results and activities while representing the brand of the client. For the end-customer, it usually appears as if the sales team sold the product themselves rather than the sales outsourcing firm. The outsourcing firm is, in essence, an extension of the client but is responsible for all operations associated with direct sales activities, often receiving sales engineering and initial product/service [[training]] support from the client.

== Purpose of indirect sales ==
The sole purpose of a contract sales organization is to provide sales resource to its clients, without taking title to their products.  Sales outsourcing providers include [[manufacturers' representative]]s, contract sales organizations, sales agents or sales outsourcing consultants. One way of organising the sales effort, especially when product delivery is erratic, is to replace or supplement internal resources with [[wikt:function|functionality]] and expertise brought in from contract sales organisations.

Sales outsourcing is quite different from large-scale service outsourcing, which has its advantages but also requires pro-active contract and relationship management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=E|title=Outsourcing the sales function: The real cost of field sales|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/South-western|location=Mason, Ohio|author2=Trinkle }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Novick|first=H. J.|title=Selling through independent reps|year=2000|publisher=AMACOM|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to full sales outsourcing, many partial models are observed, particularly in large firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=B|title=An exploratory study of the make-or-buy decision in pharmaceutical sales|journal=Journal of Medical Marketing|year=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=11–20|doi=10.1057/jmm.2008.32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

Sales outsourcing is expected to be cheaper than the fully loaded cost of employing salespeople, but calculating the cost comparison over time is far from straightforward. Nevertheless, replacing fixed costs with variable costs is attractive to budget-holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=B|title=An exploratory study of the make-or-buy decision in pharmaceutical sales|journal=Journal of Medical Marketing|year=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=11–20|doi=10.1057/jmm.2008.32}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike many forms of outsourcing, the advantages of sales outsourcing does not often come from saving costs but rather increasing [[revenue]] or providing speed of response or flexibility.

The [[business case]] for sales outsourcing should also include consideration of the cost of controlling the contract.  Difficulty in measuring the link between sales activity and sales performance leads to a preference for employed salespeople.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krafft|first=M |author2=Albers, S. |author3=Lal, R.|title=Relative Explanatory Power of Agency Theory and Transaction Cost Analysis in German Salesforces|journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing|year=2004|volume=21|issue=3|pages=265–283|doi=10.1016/j.ijresmar.2003.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the issues internally are often the same and the internal hire has many other corporate "distractions" that do not occur with external resources.

Companies may also choose sales outsourcing as a means of accessing the best sales skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=E|title=Outsourcing the sales function: The real cost of field sales|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/South-western|location=Mason, Ohio|author2=Trinkle }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[pejorative]] term “rent-a-rep” is still used, there is some evidence that contractors are perceived as good performers against qualitative as well as quantitative performance criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=E|title=Outsourcing the sales function: The real cost of field sales|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/South-western|location=Mason, Ohio|author2=Trinkle }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the reputational risk of third parties handling customer relationships has been observed as a factor restricting sales outsourcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiss|first=A M |author2=Anderson E |author3=MacInnis D J|title=Reputation Management as a Motivation for Sales Structure Decisions|journal=Journal of Marketing|year=1999|volume=63|pages=74–89|doi=10.2307/1251975}}&lt;/ref&gt; One could argue that an employee is often using a company to gain 2–3 years salary and experience whereas a sales outsourcing firm would usually be looking at a long term contract even though the staff may change during that time. So the aims of an outsourcer can be closely aligned with the aims and objectives of the contracting company.

A recent study has highlighted flexibility as an important driver for outsourcing sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=B|title=An exploratory study of the make-or-buy decision in pharmaceutical sales|journal=Journal of Medical Marketing|year=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=11–20|doi=10.1057/jmm.2008.32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uncertain business environments accentuate the need to turn sales resource on and off quickly. Industries and companies undergoing rapid change may need to avoid hiring and firing costs and risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downey|first=J. M.|title=Risks of outsourcing - applying risk management to staffing methods|journal=Facilities|year=1995|volume=13|series=9/10|pages=38–44|doi=10.1108/02632779510095617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contract sales organizations can absorb employment risk, enabling their clients to respond to short-term opportunities or competitor activity (see [[Lean startup#Philosophy|Lean startup]]). However, an outsourcer may build in more of a premium to the rate or commission if excessive flexibility is required on a contract.

Contract sales organizations are growing in volume and influence, able to provide both tactical activity and long-term strategic support to their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=B|title=Contract sales organizations (CSOs): making the transition from tactical resource to strategic partnering|journal=Journal of Medical Marketing|year=2008|volume=8|series=1|pages=39–47|doi=10.1057/palgrave.jmm.5050119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.salespartnerships.com/resources/articles/contract-pharmaceutical-sales-pharma-landscape|title=Contract Pharmaceutical Sales: The Changing Pharma Landscape|date=2017-09-06|work=Sales Partnerships|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speed of response is seen as a key reason to use an outsourcer. If a company was looking to enter a market it may take several months to recruit the local manager which then takes several months to find an office and build a team. With an outsourcer, a full working team can oftentimes be operational within a matter of days or weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Poulter|first=Julian|title=Selling People Ltd|newspaper=Sales outsourcing alternatives|date=2005-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales outsourcing can also be used as a [[market entry strategy]] and avoids [[permanent establishment]] risk.

==Indirect sales growth rate==
The experience of many organizations over the past several years demonstrates that indirect channels can be critical to expanding market coverage. This has been particularly true in the [[electronics]], [[communications]] and [[high tech]] sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chugg|first=Justin|title=What is a Master Agent?|url=http://www.telarus.com/why-telarus.php|publisher=Telecom Channel News|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the indirect channel now accounts for 66 percent of overall technology sales, up from 53 percent in 1997.

==Examples of indirect sales companies==

'''Slovak Telekom''' is the convergent telco provider with the largest internet, fixed-line, digital TV, ICT and mobile services portfolio. The company is 100% owned by Deutsche Telekom AG.

The Slovak Telekom Group consists of the parent company Slovak Telekom a.s. and its subsidiaries Zoznam s.r.o., Zoznam Mobile s.r.o., Telekom Sec s.r.o., PosAm s.r.o., and DIGI SLOVAKIA s.r.o.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telekom.sk/documents/10179/61107/ST_AR_2017_SVK_INTERACTIVE.pdf|title=Slovak Telekom Annual Report 2017 in Slovak – Slovak Telekom Ročná Správa 2017,|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Until 1 July 2010, T-Mobile Slovensko was a mobile operator and a separate company owned by Slovak Telekom. After this date, T-Mobile was merged with the parent company Slovak Telekom.

Until 2 May 2005, T-Mobile Slovensko operated under the name EuroTel Bratislava.

== Services ==
As of April 2018, Slovak Telekom covers 93% of Slovak population with 4G mobile network,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telekom.sk/o-spolocnosti-telekom/press-centrum/tlacove-spravy/news-telekom-pokryva-lte-sietou-uz-93-populacie-slovenska-expanduje-aj-s-lte-a-a-volte|title=NEWS: Telekom pokrýva LTE sieťou už 93% populácie Slovenska, expanduje aj s LTE-A a VoLTE - Telekom|website=www.telekom.sk|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced LTE-A technology to various towns in Slovakia, with speeds up to 375Mbps. It also introduced VoLTE (Voice over LTE) technology that allows calls directly in 4G, without need to switch to 3G and 2G.

Digital television service of Slovak Telekom, Magio TV, reached 600,000 customers in Q1 2018. The company also branched out to a new line of products for connected home and internet of things (IoT) and introduced a Magenta SmartHome brand.

Slovak Telekom had four strategic priorities in 2017: innovations, best connectivity, superior user experience and digital television.

'''Technologies:'''  GSM, GPRS, EDGE, UMTS, HSDPA, LTE-A, VoLTE, Flash-OFDM, VDSL, FTTH

'''Prefixes:''' +421901; +421902, +421903, +421904, +421910, +421911, +421912, +421914

== Corporate Responsibility ==
Slovak Telekom promotes the value of social inclusiveness and empathy within the company and in public, through a long term support for the Slovak community of people with hearing impairment: supporting their entrepreneurship skills, better education of children through a program of visiting personal tutors, and by providing services of online interpreters.

== Communication ==
Since 2018, the new public face of the company in advertising campaigns is Bekim, a Slovak comedian and rapper, who started to use a wheelchair after he suffered an accident during a bicycle motocross competition in 2005. Bekim follows Peter Sagan, a famous Slovak professional road bicycle racer, who represented Slovak Telekom before him.  The company’s slogan is “'''ÁNO'''” (“YES”) symbolizing a yell of an inventor who shouts “Yes” after coming up with some new technology. It also represents a defiant call that “Nothing is impossible”, “I say yes to a challenge” and “I will make it”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2042">The '''Takwa''' settlement is situated on  the south side of [[Manda Island]], in the [[Lamu District]] in the coastal province of [[Kenya]]. They are the ruins of a  town which was abandoned around the 18th century.

The Takwa site can be easily reached from [[Lamu]] town. The ruins  were first excavated by James Kirkman in 1951. In 1972 the site was cleared again under the supervision of James de Vere Allen, the Curator of the Lamu Museum.

Takwa was never a large place. It was founded around 1500, and probably abandoned around 1700. Kirkman thought that it was perhaps a place where holy men or religious people retreated. The Great Mosque at Takwa is relatively well preserved. The other structure of importance is the Pillar Tomb, which has an inscription with the date of 1681-1682.
It is reported that when Takwa was abandoned, its inhabitants settled just across the bay at [[Lamu Island#Shela|Shela]] on [[Lamu Island]]. Twice a year the people of Shela come to the Pillar Tomb in Takwa to pray  for rain.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 1973, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  The Takwa Ruins were designated a Kenyan National Monument in 1982.

'''Zamba''' is the Supreme Creator-God of the [[Yaoundé]] people of the [[Cameroon]]s. According to the Yaoundé people, he made the Earth and all its creatures except human beings. He left that job to his four sons, Ngi (gorilla) the strong, N'Kokon (mantis) the wise, Otukut (lizard) the fool, and Wo (chimpanzee) the curious - and each made human beings in his own image, which is why we are the way we are.
