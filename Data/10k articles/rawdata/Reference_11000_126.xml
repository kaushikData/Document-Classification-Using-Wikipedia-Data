'''YP Midwest Publishing LLC.''', originally '''Ameritech Publishing, Inc.''', was formed in 1983 during the [[Bell System Divestiture]]. It combined the former directory operations of [[Illinois Bell]], [[Indiana Bell]], [[Michigan Bell]], [[Ohio Bell]] and [[Wisconsin Telephone]]. Ameritech Publishing published telephone directories in Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Directories in [[Illinois]] were made in a joint venture with [[R. H. Donnelley]].

Prior to brand standardization by [[SBC Communications]], Ameritech directories were published under the '''PagesPlus''' brand.

Ameritech Publishing's operations in Illinois and northwest Indiana were placed in a partnership with [[R. H. Donnelley]], called '''DonTech''', in 1999.

Following brand standardization since 2002, Ameritech Publishing, the company, is currently known as '''Ameritech Publishing, Inc. d/b/a AT&amp;T Advertising &amp; Publishing'''.

==Spinoff==
In 2012, Ameritech Publishing (along with the rest of AT&amp;T Advertising Solutions) was spun off into [[YP Holdings]]. Ameritech Publishing was then renamed '''YP Midwest Publishing LLC.'''

The '''Angelitos Athena''' is an ancient marble statue, which was made around 480-470 BC.  The figure, the earliest known depiction of the armed [[Athena]], is an example of the [[severe style]], the transitional style between archaic and classical Greek sculpture which developed after the [[Persian Wars]]. Today it is located at the [[Acropolis Museum]] under the inventory number 140.&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;Dimitrios Pandermalis, Stamatia Eleftheratou, Christina Vlassopoulou, 2014, ''Acropolis Museum: Guide'', p.180&lt;/ref&gt; 

The statue is heavily damaged and has lost its head. Like earlier depictions of Athena she wears the archaic [[peplos]], but she also has the [[aegis]] over her shoulders, with a [[gorgoneion]] in the centre of her chest. Her upraised right arm survives up to the wrist and once held a spear. Her left arm is entirely missing except for the shoulder and traces of her left hand resting on her waist. 

The statue is believed, not completely uncontroversially, to have stood atop a preserved [[doric column]]  which reads:&lt;ref name=Guide /&gt; 
{{Quote|Angelitos dedicated me. Venerable Athena, may this gift be pleasing to you. [[Euenor (sculptor)|Euenor]] made it}}
It was found under the [[Perserschutt]] on the [[Akropolis]] in [[Athens]], near the [[Kritios boy]] and the [[Moscophoros]].

[[File:Australian Poultry Standard.jpg|thumb|right|The cover of the 1998 first edition]]

The '''''Australian Poultry Standards''''' is the official [[breed standard]] for [[poultry]] [[Animal fancy|fancy]] in [[Australia]]. It is the standard of perfection from which all poultry in Australia is supposed to be judged when exhibited at [[poultry show]]s. It is published by Victorian Poultry Fanciers Association, the [[peak body]] for poultry in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and agreed to by all other state peak bodies.

==Publication==
Published by the Victorian Poultry Fanciers Association Inc., the first edition of the ''Australian Poultry Standard'' was published in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Bishop, James | author2=Victorian Poultry Fanciers Association | title=Australian poultry standards : complete descriptions and judging points for all standardised breeds and varieties of domestic poultry in the Commonwealth of Australia | publication-date=1998 | publisher=Victorian Poultry Fanciers' Association Inc | edition=1st | isbn=978-0-646-36231-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been replaced by the second edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Victorian Poultry Fanciers Association | author2=Poultry Stud Breeders and Exhibitors Victoria | title=Australian poultry standards | publication-date=2011 | publisher=Victorian Poultry Fanciers Association Limited | edition=2nd | isbn=978-1-921488-23-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;or a pictorial list of the chicken breeds listed in the Australian Poultry Standard 2nd Edition, see the [http://www.backyardpoultry.com/wiki/index.php/Chicken_Breeds_Chart Backyard Poultry Chicken Breeds Chart]&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia has no national peak body for poultry, relying on state bodies and national [[breed club]]s. The state bodies who are party to the standards are as follows (None of the mainland territories have a statewide poultry society)
 
*Victorian Poultry Fanciers Association (trades as Poultry Stud Breeders and Exhibitors Victoria) (founded 1970)
*Tasmanian Poultry Fanciers Association
*South Australian Poultry Association
*Exhibition Poultry Association of New South Wales
*Western Australian Poultry Association (founded 1889)
*Feather Clubs Association of Queensland (founded 1959)

==Classification of breeds==
The ''Australian Poultry Standard'' classifies all chicken breeds as either hard feather or soft feather, and then further divides them into the [[Bantam (poultry)|bantam]] or standard size. Breeds which have less under fluff and feathers which are closer to the body fall under hard feather, such as the [[Old English Game]] and [[Asil (chicken)|Asil]]. Breeds with more under fluff and softer feathers, such as the [[Silkie]], [[Australorp]] and [[Leghorn (chicken)|Leghorn]], are classed as soft feather.

The ''Australian Poultry Standards'' also includes standards for ducks, geese, turkeys and Guinea fowl. Ducks are divided into two classes, bantam or standard size, and all [[domestic turkey|turkey]]s, [[geese]] and [[guinea fowl]] have only one class each.

==Earlier publications==
[[File:Points of Fowl with Key.JPG|right|thumb|Hadlingtons' ''Points of Fowl'' from the 1940s]]
In the 1940s and earlier, other publications in Australia about poultry, such as Hadlingtons,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Hadlington, James | title=Hadlington's Australian poultry book | publication-date=1943 | publisher=Angus &amp; Robertson | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/12957607 | accessdate=6 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; did have some parts devoted to aspects of showing birds, were less oriented towards show standards, and more detailed about general management of poultry, in line with his earliest publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Hadlington, James | author2=New South Wales.

'''Bernard H. Haggin''' (December 29, 1900 - May 28, 1987), known as '''B.H. Haggin''', was an American [[music]] [[critic]].

==Early life==
A lifelong resident of [[New York City]], he graduated from the [[Juilliard School]] in 1920 as a  [[piano]] major.  He published his first article in 1923, and his career as a journalist commenced shortly thereafter as a contributor to ''[[The New Republic]].''

==Career==
He was music critic of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle from 1934 to 1937, and from 1936 to 1957 was music critic of ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]''.  From 1946 to 1949, he wrote a column for music on the radio for The [[New York Herald Tribune]].

Haggin was a staunch but not entirely uncritical admirer of the [[Conducting|conductor]] [[Arturo Toscanini]].  Their personal friendship lasted from the late 1930s, shortly after Toscanini started conducting the NBC Symphony, which the network had enlarged from its house orchestra for him, on Christmas night 1937, to 1950, four years before Toscanini's retirement.  He was the first major American critic to recognize choreographer George Balanchine.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Also in the 1930s, he launched the career of the future record producer John Hammond, hiring him as a reviewer for the ''[[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]''{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

Haggin wrote twelve books on music and two on [[ballet]]. He was the author of the first general guide to recorded classical music, ''Music on Records'' (1938), later expanded as ''The Listener's Musical Companion'' (1956), which Haggin regularly updated in new editions until 1978. His best-known books are about Toscanini: ''Conversations with Toscanini'' (1959), a personal reminiscence and the closest thing to a series of interviews with the publicity-shy Toscanini that has ever been published, and ''The Toscanini Musicians Knew'' (1967), a series of interviews with musicians who played or sang under the venerable Italian maestro. The two volumes were republished in 1989 as ''Arturo Toscanini, Contemporary Recollections of the Maestro''. 

Haggin was one of the few critics who became personally close to Toscanini, who gave him access to private documents and other utterances that he had never permitted to any other author. The Haggin books were designed to serve as a corrective to factual errors, and to what Haggin regarded as misinformed opinions, which had already begun to circulate in the American media.

As a critic, Haggin showed little patience for mediocre music, musicians or fellow critics. He criticized [[RCA Victor]] for issuing badly engineered or mastered recordings of Toscanini and "enhancing" them with echo-chamber effects, treble-peaking and/or pseudo-stereo sound.  (Partly because of Haggin's complaints, later editions of those recordings did without such interventions.) In addition, Haggin was strongly critical of the interpretive style of Romantically inclined conductors who often deviated from the printed score like [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]], who at the time was considered Toscanini's polar opposite and greatest rival. Nor was he loath to make value judgments about some later Romantic (like Brahms, Wagner and Richard Strauss) and many leading twentieth-century composers and works; such outspokenness offended some of his readers, and endeared him to others.  Even Toscanini's own repertoire choices were by no means always safe from Haggin's censure. For instance, when Toscanini gave the American premiere of Shostakovich's ''Leningrad'' Symphony in 1942 (he described this symphony as epitomizing the "suffering of the Russian people" at the hands of the German invaders), Haggin dissented, declaring the piece to be "an inflated monstrosity of straining, portentous banality."  Also Haggin made some of his most passionate pronouncements from the standpoint of "meta-criticism," sometimes spending more [[column inch]]es in criticizing his fellow critics' opinions than in expressing his own sentiments on the music or performers in question.

In his later years, he wrote various long essays for ''[[The Hudson Review]], [[The New Republic]], [[Musical America]]'', ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'', and ''[[The Yale Review]]''.

'''Billy Darnell''' (February 25, 1926 &amp;ndash; September 7, 2007) was an American [[professional wrestler]] and major star of the 1940s and 1950s, with his career spanning over twenty years with championships in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] and [[World Wide Wrestling Federation]].&lt;ref name="slam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/09/08/4480688.html|title=Billy Darnell was a consummate fan favourite|author=Steven Johnson|accessdate=2008-01-30|publisher=SLAM! Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Darnell was born in [[Camden, New Jersey]]. At age 16, while working as a lifeguard in [[Wildwood, New Jersey]], he was playfighting with co-workers when a [[wrestling promoter]] spotted him and asked him to help with his roster, as many current ones were seeing action in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="slam"/&gt;

==Career==
His first match with later rival [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]] was in February 1944, tagging with him in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Baltimore-Washington]]. Darnell would himself leave wrestling for World War II service in December 1944, joining the [[United States Army]].&lt;ref name="slam"/&gt; [[Post-war]] Darnell returned to wrestling in [[Texas]], once more with Rogers, who had previously wrestled under his real name Herman Rohde. At the time he was becoming "Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers, and Darnell was booked as his brother Billy Rogers. This was largely in part to promoter and Rogers' booker [[Jack Pfefer]], though Darnell himself has stated he wasn't sure if the idea for the brother gimmick was Rogers' or Pfefer's.&lt;ref name="slam"/&gt;

Darnell and Rogers next went to [[California]], with wrestling reaching new popularity thanks to [[television]] exposure. For the showmanship of it Rogers donned [[sequin]]ed capes, whereas Darnell first donned the [[leopard]]-skin outfit, for which he would become famous. Their careers would become forever intertwined when they began facing each other with Rogers as the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] champion and Darnell becoming a heavy fan favorite. Promoters nationwide wanted the Rogers-Darnell match, with more than 200 matches occurring between them.  Despite their history Rogers still crushed discs in Darnell's neck with a [[Botch (professional wrestling)|botched]] [[piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]], though he himself accidentally knocked out some of Rogers' teeth. [[Les Thatcher]] has even stated that Darnell's matches with Rogers inspired him to enter the wrestling business.

Darnell was also known for a well recognized team with [[Bill Melby]], winning the [[Chicago]] version of the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] with him in 1953.&lt;ref name="JohnsonOliver2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven Johnson|author2=Greg Oliver|author3=Mike Mooneyham|author4=J. J. Dillon|title=The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: Heroes and Icons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wxLpfRhZqcC&amp;pg=PT344|date=1 October 2012|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-77090-269-5|pages=344–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, he worked with [[Sam Muchnick]] in [[St. Louis]] and also booked for an Indiana promotion. In a televised match on 20 May 1961, Darnell beat Ali Pasha (Alexander Vieira Fontes) who died of a heart attack after being slammed down.&lt;ref name="JohnsonOliver2012"/&gt;

He used his World War II [[G.I. Bill]] to attend [[aviation]] school and become a [[Aviator|pilot]], flying himself to his matches.  He also ran a [[nightclub]] until 1985. Though Darnell retired in 1961, he would wrestle sparsely into the next year, then went to a [[chiropractic]] school in [[Glendale, California]], finishing in Indiana.  He would begin practicing in his home of New Jersey and moved to [[Florida]] for a period, getting back in touch with Rogers, before returning to New Jersey. Darnell regularly attended [[Cauliflower Alley Club]] reunions and received the [[Senator Hugh Farley Award]] from the [[Amsterdam, New York]]-based [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="slam"/&gt; Darnell died on September 7, 2007 at his home in [[Maple Shade Township, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="slam"/&gt;

'''Blue pages''' are a [[telephone directory]] listing of American and Canadian state agencies,  [[government]] agencies, federal government and other official entities, along with specific offices, departments, or bureaus located wherein.

==Canada==
Canadian yellow-page listings currently indicate "Government Of Canada-See Government Listings In The Blue Pages"; in markets where the local telephone directory is a single volume, the blue pages and community information normally appear after the alphabetical white-page listings but before the yellow pages advertising. The blue page listings include both provincial and federal entities.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the blue pages included state, federal, and local offices, including [[service district]]s such as school districts, port authorities, public utility providers, parks districts, fire districts, and the like. The blue pages also provided information about government services, in addition to officials' names, addresses, telephone numbers, and other contact information. The color blue is likely derived from so-called government blue books, official publications printed by a government (such as that of a state) describing its organization, and providing a list of contact information. (The blue pages published in a printed telephone directory is usually quite abridged, compared to official blue books).

==Other==
The name "blue pages" has been used for various specialised directories by private-sector entities such as the internal IBM Staff directory.

'''The Case of Swans''' (1592) Trinity Term, 34 [[Elizabeth I]],  is a landmark decision in [[English law]].

==Background==
[[Dame (title)|Dame]] [[Giles Strangways (died 1562)#Family|Joan Young]] and Thomas Saunger received a [[writ]] from the [[Exchequer]], directing the [[High Sheriff of Dorset|Sheriff of Dorset]] to round up 400 loose [[swan]]s from the rivers of the county. Swans were Royal fowl, however, and a wild swan was considered the property of the monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Edward Coke]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=SzlFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=Joan+Young+and+Thomas+Saunger&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wKM9fjL1hn&amp;sig=OBuFZV8B7pPmZepUyMh6I1mecRA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jEfJULHzCaWhiAek14DQDQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Joan%20Young%20and%20Thomas%20Saunger&amp;f=false The reports of Sir Edward Coke in thirteen parts].J. Butterworth and Son, 1826 page 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Chitty, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mY89AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA833&amp;lpg=PA833&amp;dq=Joan+Young+and+Thomas+Saunger&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MPYCYhElX2&amp;sig=Bzztgg7dA2cD9oqXLNZ5hgBKxhk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jEfJULHzCaWhiAek14DQDQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw A treatise on the game laws and on fisheries]. W Clarke 1812 page 834&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to these swans in [[Dorset]] had since [[time immemorial]] been held by the local abbot, who lost the right along with the [[Abbotsbury Abbey|abbey]] to [[Henry VIII]] at the [[dissolution of the Monasteries]]. Henry then granted the estate to [[Giles Strangways (died 1546)|Giles Strangways]], Dame Joan's deceased first husband, whose heir gave them a right to the swans for one year. The new Queen, Elizabeth I, now sought possession of the swans.

==Finding==
The question was whether the swans were Strangways’s to grant or remained the Queen’s. Sir [[Edward Coke]], as [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]], represented the Queen.

The Court held that the swans that are ''[[ferae naturae]]'', or wild animals, cannot be given by transfer or taken by prescription.

The '''Château de Compiègne''' is a [[France|French]] [[chateau]], a royal residence built for [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and restored by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. Compiègne was one of three seats of royal government, the others being [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] and [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]]. It is located in [[Compiègne]] in the [[Oise]] [[Departments of  France|department]] and is open to the public.

Even before the chateau was constructed, Compiègne was the preferred summer residence for French monarchs, primarily for hunting given its proximity to Compiègne Forest. The first royal residence was built in 1374 for [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], and a long procession of successors both visited it and modified it. [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] resided in Compiègne some 75 times. Louis XV was perhaps even more favorably impressed; the [[Comte de Chevergny]] described his infatuation: "Hunting was his main passion... and Compiègne, with its immense forest, with its endless avenues amongst the trees, with its stretches down which you could ride all day and never come to the end, was the ideal place to indulge that passion."

In 1750, prominent architect [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] proposed a thorough renovation of the chateau. Work began in 1751 and was finished in 1788 by Gabriel's student [[Le Dreux de La Châtre]]. The ancient town ramparts dictated the château's triangular plan; the resultant building covers about {{convert|5|acre|m2}}. It is Neoclassical in style, with simplicity and clarity governing both its external and interior features.

During the [[French Revolution]], the château passed into the jurisdiction of the Minister for the Interior. In 1795 all furniture was sold and its works of art were sent to the [[Muséum Central]]; it was essentially gutted. 
Napoleon visited in 1799 and again in 1803. In 1804 the château became an imperial domain and in 1807 he ordered it be made habitable again. Architects Berthault, [[Charles Percier|Percier]] and [[Pierre François Léonard Fontaine|Fontaine]], decorators Dubois and [[Pierre-Joseph Redouté|Redouté]], and cabinetmakers [[François-Honoré-Georges Jacob-Desmalter|Jacob-Desmalter]] and Marcion restored the château. Its layout was altered, a ballroom added, and the garden was replanted and linked directly to the forest.

The result is an example of [[First French Empire]] style (1808-1810), though some traces of the earlier décor survive. The writer [[Auguste Luchet]] remarked that "Compiègne speaks of Napoleon as Versailles  does of Louis XIV". From 1856 on, [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] and Eugénie made it their autumn residence, and redecorated some rooms in the Second Empire style.

Today's visitors can find three distinct museums within the chateau: the apartments themselves; the Museum of the Second Empire; and the National Car Museum (Le Musée de la Voiture), founded in 1927, with a collection of [[carriage]]s, [[bicycle]]s, and [[automobile]]s.

{{italic title}}
'''''Constructing a Story''''' (French: ''Construire un récit'') by filmmaker and script doctor [[Yves Lavandier]] (''[[Writing Drama]]''), is a treatise on conceiving and writing stories for the cinema, the theater, television, and comic books, but also for novels, albeit to a lesser degree. The English edition, translated by story consultant Alexis Niki, was published in May 2017 by Le Clown &amp; l’Enfant.

==Content==
Upon the re-publication of the French version of ''[[Writing Drama]]'' in 2011, [[Yves Lavandier]] decided to extract the book’s most useful chapters and to create two stand-alone books: ''Construire un récit'' and ''Evaluer un scénario'' (''[[Analyzing a Script]]''). ''Construire un récit'' grew from 50 pages in the French version of ''Writing Drama'' to 170, and then to 220 for the 2016 edition.

''Constructing a Story'' is a practical handbook on how to write a narrative. Yves Lavandier’s ambition is to help authors who want to tell a story convey their thoughts and their universe in an accessible way. For this he proposes a method that starts from the meaning the author wants to communicate to arrive at the complete narrative via the steps of the pitch, the foundations, the milestones, the step outline, and the treatment. The general principle of Lavandier’s approach is: "''You don’t build a house starting with the wallpaper.''"

As in ''[[Writing Drama]]'', the author puts forth a vision of the ''[[three-act structure]]'' that differs to that of many Anglo-Saxon theorists and that he considers "''simple, logical, and more importantly, natural: before the action, during the action, after the action."''

In addition to several passages covering the work of characterization, a large chapter is dedicated entirely to the character arc, the potential for psychological transformation for one of the characters. The author proposes tools to justify such a transformation and analyzes some twenty works from the specific angle of the character arc. Among these are: ''[[The Apartment]]'', ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', ''[[Groundhog Day]]'', ''[[The Lives of Others]]'', ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest]]'', ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', ''[[Schindler’s List]]'', ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', and ''[[Toy Story]]''. In his analysis of the beginning of ''[[Tootsie]]'', for example, [[Yves Lavandier]] points out that contrary to many other analyses, the protagonist (Dustin Hoffman) is not actually characterized as a chauvinist who needs to learn to respect women.

== Front cover==

The cover photo represents romanesco broccoli, a natural example of fractal structure. [[Yves Lavandier]] considers the objective-obstacle pairing to be the basic pattern of story, and to follow the fractal principle. In Lavandier’s view, narrative is the combination, at different scales, of thousands of objective-obstacle pairings and of their resulting mechanisms: the protagonist, the inciting incident, the three-act structure, the climax, etc. The author uses ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' to illustrate his point.

==Reception==

In the magazine L’Avant-Scène Cinéma issue 609 (January 2014), Jean-Philippe Guérand writes : "''Constructing a Story is a veritable guide of writing know-how in which the author prods his reader and  pushes the emerging screenwriter to give his best with sections such as "Be ferocious to your protagonist" or "Make the audience participate," and is applicable to both cinema and television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avantscenecinema.com/numero-609-seul-contre-tous-de-gaspar-noe/ L’Avant-Scène Cinéma {{n°|609}} (janvier 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;"

Screenwriter and game designer Antoine Bauza states: "''While it can’t replace the reading of the sacrosanct tome ''[[Writing Drama]]'', Constructing a Story is a gold mine in its own right (and an excellent complement) for writers. It gave me precious advice as well as a solid dose of motivation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/ConstruireUnRecit-temoignages.htm Comment by Antoine Bauza]&lt;/ref&gt;''"

For film agent Julian Friedmann, ''Constructing a Story'' manages to get underneath the skin of the story.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/julianfriedmann/status/878927567620853761 Tweet by Julian Friedmann]&lt;/ref&gt;

"''The chapter on creating story and character arcs is unique''", writes screenwriter and novelist Ann Kimbrough,  "''I’ve never seen anyone break down arcs in this manner. I found it very useful as a writer of any medium. It’s a MUST READ part of the book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://screenwritersdailydose.com/2017/08/04/constructing-a-story-book-review/ Review by Ann Kimbrough]&lt;/ref&gt;''"

For screenwriter, teacher and script consultant Elana Golden, "''Constructing a Story is also a meditation on the creative process in general and cinema in particular, with examples from European and American films and from psychology, philosophy, classic theater and archetypal stories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Constructing-Story-Yves-Lavandier/dp/2910606147/#customerReviews Review by Elana Golden]&lt;/ref&gt;''"

[[Image:Charles Darwin.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Charles Darwin in 1854]]
The British [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Charles Darwin]] corresponded with numerous other luminaries of his age and members of [[Darwin — Wedgwood family|his family]]. These have provided many insights about the nineteenth century, from scientific exploration and travel to religious debate and discussion. The letters also illuminate many aspects of Darwin's work: the development of his scientific ideas; his opinions on issues he did not publish about (his letters to [[Asa Gray]], for example, show his changing opinions on the [[American Civil War]]); matters about his character and health; the ways in which he relied upon correspondence for much of his investigations into natural history; and the ways in which he marshalled scientific support for his ideas amongst friends and colleagues. The historian of science [[Janet Browne]] has argued in her biography of Darwin that his ability to correspond daily played a crucial role in the development of his theory and his ability to garner support for it from colleagues.

== History ==
Correspondence was central to Darwin's research. In his early years, most of the letters he filed away immediately were those relevant to one of his ongoing scientific projects. Other letters were stuck onto "spits", as he called them, and when his slender stock of these was exhausted, he would burn the letters of several years, in order that he might make use of the liberated "spits."  This process, carried on for years, destroyed many of the letters received before 1862. Even so, the number of letters is remarkable, even in these early years. After publication of the [[Origin of Species]], Darwin's children convinced him to save a far greater proportion of his correspondence, so that the sequence from the early 1860s onwards is remarkably full. 
[[Image:Darwin Life And Letters.jpg|thumb|150px|Photocopied title page of the original edition of Charles Darwin's autobiography.]]
In 1887, five years after Darwin's death, Darwin's son [[Francis Darwin]] published ''[[The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin]]'' in three volumes, to accompany the publication of ''[[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin]]''. This was later followed by two volumes of ''[[More Letters of Charles Darwin]]'' published in 1902.

In 1974 the Darwin Correspondence Project was founded at [[Cambridge University]] by [[Frederick Burkhardt]], with the aid of Sydney Smith. Cambridge University owns 9,000 letters and has obtained copies of another 6,000 held in private collections. New letters are being discovered at around 60 per year and photocopies of new finds should be sent to the project, which will eventually publish them. Volumes of the correspondence appear at regular intervals from Cambridge University Press, with the content freely available online after four years.  The Darwin Correspondence website also includes extensive additional materials, including resources for using the letters in school and university teaching.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3309">'''Edwin A. (Eddie) Goodman''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|PC|OC|QC}} (1918 – August 23, 2006) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] lawyer and political figure.

Goodman graduated from Toronto's [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] in 1947&lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/osgoodealumni/docs/2007_continuum__revised__4_23__2010_/18&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the founding partners of [[Goodmans|Goodmans LLP]], a [[Toronto]] law firm as well as a life bencher of the [[Law Society of Upper Canada]]. He is best known, however, for his political work as an advisor and fundraiser for both the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] and particularly the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]], having been a friend and advisor to both [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] [[John Robarts]] and Premier [[Bill Davis]]. He has served as the national chair of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and as vice-president of both the Ontario and federal Progressive Conservative Party.

Goodman was also active in charity work as honorary president of [[Scouts Canada]] and as a director for various bodies such as the Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care and [[Princess Margaret Cancer Centre|Princess Margaret Hospital]]. He was also chairman of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] for six years.

He was considered a [[Red Tory]] and was part of the circle known as the [[Big Blue Machine]] that helped keep the Ontario Tories in power under Robarts and Davis.

He once ran for public office losing to Communist [[J.B. Salsberg]] of the [[Labor-Progressive Party]] after World War II.

In April 1975 his daughter Joanne Goodman was killed in a highway accident.  He named a lecture series at the [[University of Western Ontario]] which every year invites a history to give a series of lectures to the University community &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.uwo.ca/events/joannegoodmanlectures.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913034858/http://history.uwo.ca/events/joannegoodmanlectures.html |archivedate=2010-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Goodman was named to the [[Security Intelligence Review Committee]] and was appointed to the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]].

His autobiography, ''The Life of the Party'', was published in 1988. He is also an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]].

Goodman died following a heart attack.

'''''Elvira, Mistress of the Dark''''' is a 1988 American [[comedy horror]] film directed by [[James Signorelli]]. [[Cassandra Peterson]] plays the role of [[horror host]]ess Elvira in the character's feature film debut. The screenplay was written by Peterson, [[John Paragon]] and  [[Sam Egan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 'Elvira' Matches Films She Introduces on TV |publisher= LA Times|date=1988-09-30|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-30/entertainment/ca-3005_1_midnight-movie|accessdate=2010-08-24 | first=Kevin | last=Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Los Angeles]] TV horror hostess Elvira, Mistress of the Dark quits her job after the station's new owner [[sexual harassment|sexually harasses]] her. She plans to open an act in [[Las Vegas]], but needs $50,000 for the project. Upon learning she is a [[beneficiary]] of her deceased great-aunt Morgana, she travels to Fallwell, [[Massachusetts]], to claim the inheritance, which includes a mansion, a recipe book and Morgana's pet [[poodle]], Algonquin.

In Fallwell, Elvira's worldly attitude and revealing clothes set the conservative town council against her. But theater operator Bob Redding befriends her.  The town's teenagers quickly accept her, to the chagrin of their parents, who consider her a bad influence. Bowling alley owner Patty is interested in Bob, and at her late-night gory [[film festival]] she was presenting at Bob's theater she succeeds in humiliating Elvira. Elvira struggles to sell the house, so she can depart for Las Vegas. Meanwhile, she is unaware that her harsh but seemingly-harmless uncle Vincent is actually a [[warlock]] who is obsessed with obtaining Morgana's [[grimoire|spellbook]]; he plans to kill Elvira and conquer the world, and has been fuelling the townspeople's hostility.

Elvira tries to impress Bob with a home-cooked dinner, but mistakenly uses the spellbook as a [[cookbook]] and summons a creature that attacks them. Elvira learns that the book was her mother Divana's spellbook, and that Morgana hid her to protect her from Vincent. When Elvira tries to unleash the creature against the Morality Club at their picnic, she prepares the brew incorrectly and it instead has an [[aphrodisiac]] effect; the adults remove each other's clothing indiscriminately and are arrested for [[indecent exposure]]. When Patty confronts Elvira, the resulting fistfight ends up humiliating Patty by revealing that her bra is stuffed.

Vincent leads the townspeople in arresting Elvira for [[witchcraft]], which is still illegal in the state. They decide to [[death by burning|burn her at the stake]]. The teenagers try to free her from jail, but fail and accidentally lock themselves into a different cell. Bob tries to recover the spellbook from the mansion, but is tied up by Vincent, who takes the book. Algonquin transforms into a rat and unties Bob. Elvira is tied to a stake and the fire is lit, but she uses Morgana's ring to summon rain that quenches the fire; she escapes with Bob. At the mansion, Elvira and Vincent engage in a magical battle that sets fire to the house. Elvira banishes Vincent to the [[underworld]], while the house and all of the magical artifacts are destroyed.

The next day, Elvira prepares to leave town. The townspeople apologize for their behavior, and everyone asks Elvira to stay. She kisses Bob but, as she is homeless, she insists that she must leave. Elvira has inherited Vincent's estate, which included enough money to open her show in Las Vegas. At a Las Vegas hotel, Elvira performs a lavishly produced musical number.

'''Flaming Teeth''', from [[Fiji]]an [[mythology]], was a [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] who was so large his [[tooth|teeth]] appeared as burning logs.

The giant tormented villages day after day, eating people and wreaking havoc. After so much burning and consuming of villagers a band of brave men from the village got together. They made a plan to surprise and ambush the giant by luring it under a giant rock and smashing its skull with it. They succeeded killing the giant but its teeth still were aflame. The villagers took the teeth back to the village and that was the first time man acquired the use of fire.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmore, David D.: ''Monsters: Evil Beings, Mythical Beasts, and All Manner of Imaginary Terrors'', page 123.

The '''Freedom Memorial''' ({{lang-de|Freiheitsmahnmal}}) was a memorial to the victims of the [[Berlin Wall]] in the vicinity of the [[Checkpoint Charlie Museum]] in [[Berlin]]. It opened on October 31, 2004, and was praised by both victims of the [[German Democratic Republic|GDR]] communist regime and human rights advocates alike. 

In 2004, Alexandra Hildebrandt leased an empty lot near the site of the former Checkpoint Charlie, and installed the Freedom Memorial to the victims of the border forces. While welcomed by many, it was criticized by Berlin officials as being historically and symbolically inaccurate, and for being erected by a private individual without a public process.&lt;ref name="NYT 2004"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/25/world/europe/memorial-to-berlin-wall-victims-divides-the-city-again.html |title=Memorial to Berlin Wall Victims Divides the City Again |last=Bernstein |first=Richard |date=25 December 2004 |website=The New York Times |access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the lease was terminated by the land owner, a bank. Hildebrand refused to clear out the monument, and the crosses which made up the memorial were removed by bailiffs following a court order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/mauermahnmal-abgerissen/622252.html Checkpoint Charlie: Mauermahnmal abgerissen] Harald Rohde, ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'', 5 July 2005. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4730106&lt;/ref&gt;

"The [HPCMP method for measuring system performance] is as follows: the ratio of time [for a given benchmark application] at a target processor count provides a relative measure of the system's performance on that application test case compared with the DoD standard system, stated in Habu-equivalents. Habu, the first DoD standard system, is an IBM [[POWER3]] formerly located at the US [[Naval Oceanographic Office]] (NAVO) [[Major Shared Resource Center]]. One Habu-equivalent is the performance of 1,024 system-under-study processors compared with 1,024 Habu processors.&lt;ref&gt;Larry P. Davis, Cray J. Henry, Roy L. Campbell Jr, William A. Ward.

'''HMAS ''Vampire''''' was the third of three Australian-built [[Daring class destroyer (1949)|''Daring'' class]] destroyers serving in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). One of the first all-welded ships built in Australia, she was constructed at [[Cockatoo Island Dockyard]] between 1952 and 1959, and was commissioned into the RAN a day after completion.

''Vampire'' was regularly deployed to South East Asia during her career: she was attached to the [[Far East Strategic Reserve]] on five occasions, including during the [[Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation]], and escorted the troop transport {{HMAS|Sydney|R17|6}} on six of the latter's twenty-five transport voyages to Vietnam. In 1977, the destroyer was assigned to escort the Royal Yacht [[HMY Britannia|''Britannia'']] during [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Phillip]]'s visit to Australia. In 1980, ''Vampire'' was reclassified as a training ship.

The warship remained in service until 1986, when she was decommissioned and presented to the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]] for preservation as a [[museum ship]]; the largest museum-owned object on display in Australia.

==Design==
{{Main|Daring class destroyer (1949)}}
The Royal Australian Navy initially ordered four [[Daring class destroyer (1949)|''Daring'' class destroyers]], which were to be named after the ships of the "[[Scrap Iron Flotilla]]" of World War II. The ships were modified during construction: most changes were made to improve habitability, including the installation of air-conditioning.&lt;ref name=Coop167&gt;Cooper, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vampire'' and her sister ships were the first all-welded ships to be constructed in Australia.&lt;ref name=Coop168&gt;Cooper, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Daring''s had a standard [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] of 2,800 tons, which increased to 3,600 tons at full load.&lt;ref name=Bastock320/&gt; ''Vendetta'' and her sisters were {{convert|390|ft|m}} long, with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|43|ft|m}}, and a [[draught (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|9|in|m}} at mean, and {{convert|14|ft|6|in|m}} at full or deep load.&lt;ref name=Bastock320/&gt; Her propulsion system consisted of two Foster Wheeler boilers, feeding two English Electric geared turbines, which provided {{convert|54000|hp}} to two propeller shafts.&lt;ref name=Bastock320/&gt; ''Vampire'' could sail at over  {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}}, and had a range of {{convert|3700|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|20|kn}}.&lt;ref name=Bastock320/&gt; Her standard ship's company consisted of 20 officers and 300 sailors.&lt;ref name=Bastock320/&gt;

===Armament===
''Vampire''{{'}}s main armament consisted of six [[QF 4.5 inch Mk I – V naval gun|{{convert|4.5|in|mm|adj=on}} Mark V guns]] mounted in three Mark 6 twin turrets, two forward and one aft.&lt;ref name=Bastock320/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cassells147.8/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaw9&gt;Shaw, ''HMAS Vampire'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Her anti-aircraft outfit consisted of six [[40 mm Bofors]]; two single mountings on the forward superstructure, and two twin mountings on the aft superstructure.&lt;ref name=Bastock320&gt;Bastock, ''Australia's Ships of War'', p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; Four [[M2 Browning machine gun|{{convert|0.5|in|mm|adj=on}} Browning machine guns]] were carried for point defence.&lt;ref name=Cassells147.8&gt;Cassells, ''The Destroyers'', pp. 147–8&lt;/ref&gt; Five 21-inch torpedo tubes were fitted to a single Mark IV pentad mount on the deck between the forward and aft superstructures.&lt;ref name=Cassells147.8/&gt; For anti-submarine warfare, a [[Limbo (weapon)|Limbo]] anti-submarine mortar was carried on the aft deck, offset to port.&lt;ref name=Bastock320/&gt; The twin Bofors, torpedo launcher, and Limbo mortar were all removed during various refits.&lt;ref name=Cassells149/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaw10&gt;Shaw, ''HMAS Vampire'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sea Cat missile]] system was installed at some point during her career.&lt;ref name=Cassells147.8/&gt;

[[File:HMAS Vampire forward.jpg|thumb|left|Forward section of ''Vampire''. The forward two 4.5-inch gun turrets are visible, and one of the single-mount Bofors is located near the left edge of the image.]]
''Vampire'' was fitted with a Type 170 attack sonar, a Type 174 search sonar, and a Type 185 submarine detection sonar.&lt;ref name=Shaw25&gt;Shaw, ''HMAS Vampire'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The original fire control directors were a Flyplane 3 and an MRS 8.&lt;ref name=Shaw7&gt;Shaw, ''HMAS Vampire'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; These were replaced during the 1970–71 refit with two M22 units.&lt;ref name=Shaw7/&gt; The air warning radar{{clarify|date=November 2010}} was replaced with an LW-02 air search radar during the same refit, and an 8gr-301A surface search and navigation radar was installed.&lt;ref name=Cassells149/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaw7/&gt;

==Construction==
''Vampire'' was laid down at [[Cockatoo Island Dockyard]] in Sydney, New South Wales on 1 July 1952.&lt;ref name=Cassells148&gt;Cassells, ''The Destroyers'', p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; The destroyer was launched on 27 October 1956 by the wife of the Governor-General, [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|Sir William Slim]].&lt;ref name=Bastock321&gt;Bastock, ''Australia's Ships of War'', p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; She was completed on 22 June 1959, and commissioned into the RAN in Sydney a day later.&lt;ref name=Cassells148/&gt; Between laying down and completion, the ship's cost increased from [[Australian pound|A£]]2.6 million to A£7 million.&lt;ref name=Coop168/&gt;

==Operational history==
===1959–1970===
After competing work-up trials and entering active service, ''Vampire'' underwent training exercises with ships of the RAN and [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] (RNZN) until early 1960.&lt;ref name=Cassells148/&gt; ''Vampire'' was deployed to the [[Far East Strategic Reserve]] in March 1960, and sailed to Singapore after a brief visit to New Zealand.&lt;ref name=Cassells148/&gt; She returned to Sydney in December, and was docked for refit until April 1961.&lt;ref name=Cassells148/&gt; The destroyer was awarded the [[Gloucester Cup]] for 1960, recognising her as the most efficient ship in the RAN.&lt;ref name=Bastock321/&gt; Following the refit, ''Vampire'' operated in Australian waters, including participation in the training exercise Tuckerbox in August, then returned to the Far East in September.&lt;ref name=Bastock322&gt;Bastock, ''Australia's Ships of War'', p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 December 1961, a chief petty officer died aboard from illness.&lt;ref&gt;Cassells, ''The Destroyers'', p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; The destroyer was in Hong Kong for Christmas, then in January 1962, visited [[Nha Trang]] and [[Saigon]] in Vietnam with {{HMAS|Quickmatch|G92|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vampire'' received the Gloucester Cup again for 1961.&lt;ref name=Bastock322/&gt; the first months of 1962, the ship participated in training exercises in the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal, before returning to Australia on 7 April.&lt;ref name=Bastock322/&gt; ''Vampire'' participated in Exercise Tuckerbox II during August and September, and was present at [[Fremantle, Western Australia]] during November for the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth]].&lt;ref name=Bastock322/&gt;

[[File:HMAS Vampire (D11) underway c1962.jpg|thumb|left|''Vampire'' in 1962]]
On 31 January 1963, ''Vampire'' departed for her third FESR deployment, which lasted until late July.&lt;ref name=Bastock322/&gt; During this, the destroyer participated in [[South East Asia Treaty Organisation]] (SEATO) Exercise Sea Serpent.&lt;ref name=Bastock322/&gt; After returning to Sydney, ''Vampire'' was taken in hand by Garden Island Dockyard for refit, which concluded in February 1964.&lt;ref name=Bastock322/&gt; During the docking, the ship was awarded the Gloucester Cup for 1963; the third time the award was granted to the ship.&lt;ref name=Bastock322/&gt; After post-refit trials, ''Vampire'' sailed for her fourth Far East deployment in June, and was involved in Exercise Litgas shortly after reaching the region.&lt;ref name=Bastock322/&gt; From October until January 1965, the ship was involved in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] response to the [[Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation]]; carrying out patrols around the Malay Peninsula to interdict vessels smuggling troops into Malaysia.&lt;ref name=Shaw6&gt;Shaw, ''HMAS Vampire'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The destroyer remained in South East Asia until January 1965, and returned to Sydney on 12 February.&lt;ref name=Bastock322/&gt;

After a short period of leave and self-maintenance, ''Vampire'' sailed again for the Far East in April, exercising with the [[French frigate Doudart de Lagree (F728)|French frigate ''Doudart de Lagree'']] en route from Manus Island to Manila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Doudart Days With Vampire |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Navy_News-May-28-1965.pdf |newspaper=Navy News |date=28 May 1965 |page=5 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321000717/http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Navy_News-May-28-1965.pdf |archivedate=21 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vampire'' escorted the aircraft carrier {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|6}} during SEATO Exercise Seahorse.&lt;ref name=Bastock322/&gt; During early June, ''Vampire'' accompanied the troop transport {{HMAS|Sydney|R17|6}} for parts of the latter's first transport voyage to Vietnam.&lt;ref name=NottPayne169&gt;Nott &amp; Payne, ''The Vung Tau Ferry'', p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; The ship's fifth Far East deployment was concluded when she reached Sydney on 22 June.&lt;ref name=Bastock322/&gt; On 20 December, the [[Cremation|ashes]] of Vice Admiral [[Hastings Harrington|Sir Hastings Harrington]] were scattered from ''Vampire'' off the coast of Sydney.&lt;ref name=Bastock322/&gt;

''Vampire'' was sent on her sixth Far East deployment in March 1966.&lt;ref name=Cassells148/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bastock322/&gt; In late April, ''Vampire'' was temporarily withdrawn from Strategic Reserve service to escort ''Sydney'' on her third Vietnam voyage: the destroyer returned to Hong Kong on 9 May.&lt;ref name=NottPayne170&gt;Nott &amp; Payne, ''The Vung Tau Ferry'', p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; During late May and early June, ''Vampire'' participated in SEATO Exercise Sea Imp.&lt;ref name=Bastock322/&gt; On 10 June 1966, ''Vampire'' collided with the Danish merchant ship ''Emilie Maersk'' on the [[Chao Phraya River]]; the destroyer received only minor damage, and was repaired in Singapore.&lt;ref name=Bastock322/&gt; From July to August, the destroyer was assigned to [[Tawau]] to protect the region from Indonesian aggression during the Confrontation.&lt;ref name=Bastock322/&gt; This primarily consisted of using her radar to detect approaching vessels and coordinate interception efforts, although ''Vampire'' was called on to provide [[Naval gunfire support|fire support]] for Commonwealth land forces on two occasions.&lt;ref name=Shaw6/&gt; The ship returned to Sydney on 13 August.&lt;ref name=Bastock323&gt;Bastock, ''Australia's Ships of War'', p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 January 1967, ''Vampire'' sailed for her seventh FESR tour.&lt;ref name=Bastock323/&gt; The destroyer provided assistance to the grounded freighter ''Mata Thevi'' in February, and from April until May, accompanied ''Sydney'' on the latter's fifth and sixth troop transport voyages.&lt;ref name=Bastock323/&gt;&lt;ref name=NottPayne171&gt;Nott &amp; Payne, ''The Vung Tau Ferry'', p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; During the voyage back to Australia in late August and early September, ''Vampire'' made port visits in Indonesia; the first RAN ship to do so after the Confrontation's end.&lt;ref name=Bastock323/&gt; On arrival in Sydney, the destroyer was docked for a six-month refit.&lt;ref name=Bastock323/&gt; In July 1968, ''Vampire'' and other vessels of the RAN were involved in training exercises with the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]].&lt;ref name=Bastock323/&gt; The destroyer visited Indonesia again in September, then served as review ship during a ceremonial fleet entry into Sydney Harbour: for this role, several weapons, including one of the three 4.5-inch turrets, were temporarily removed.&lt;ref name=Bastock323/&gt;

On 23 March 1969, ''Vampire'' returned to the Far East.&lt;ref name=Bastock323/&gt; On 14 May 1969, the destroyer met ''Sydney'' off Singapore, and escorted the troopship to [[Vũng Tàu]] on the former aircraft carrier's fourteenth Vietnam voyage.&lt;ref name=NottPayne174&gt;Nott &amp; Payne, ''The Vung Tau Ferry'', p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; The destroyer returned to Australian waters in October.&lt;ref name=Bastock323/&gt; On 16 April 1970, ''Vampire'' joined a fleet of 45 naval ships from 13 nations to perform a ceremonial entry into Sydney Harbour as part of the first [[Australian Bicentenary]], celebrating the discovery and claiming of the east coast of Australia by [[James Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;Lind, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', pp. 274–275&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1970, ''Vampire'' was handed over to [[Williamstown Naval Dockyard]] for a $US10 million modernisation.&lt;ref name=Cassells148/&gt; The modernisation consisted of over 2,000 upgrades and modifications.&lt;ref name=Shaw7/&gt; The sensor suite, including fire control systems, air radar, and surface radar, was updated.&lt;ref name=Shaw7/&gt; The destroyer's armament was refurbished, with the main gun turrets rebuilt and the Bofors reconditioned, although the torpedo pentad mount was removed.&lt;ref name=Shaw7/&gt; The superstructure was rebuilt, with the primary aim to enclose the open bridge area, along with modernisation of the ship's galleys and installation of more air conditioning.&lt;ref name=Shaw7/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bastock323/&gt; Redesigned masts and funnel cowlings were fitted.&lt;ref name=Bastock323/&gt; ''Vampire'' reentered active service on 4 March 1972.&lt;ref name=Cassells148/&gt;

===1972–1986===
In October 1972, ''Vampire'' was deployed to Singapore for four months as part of the [[ANZUK]] force: the first ''Daring'' class destroyer assigned to the force.&lt;ref name=Bastock323/&gt; She was temporarily withdrawn in November to accompany ''Sydney'' on her twenty-fifth and final voyage to Vũng Tàu.&lt;ref name=NottPayne178&gt;Nott &amp; Payne, ''The Vung Tau Ferry'', p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vampire'' returned to Sydney on 1 March 1973.&lt;ref name=Cassells148/&gt; In April, the destroyer sailed to [[Apia]], Samoa for the [[South Pacific Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;Bastock, ''Australia's Ships of War'', p. 323-4&lt;/ref&gt; In September, the destroyer was part of a multinational training exercise off New Zealand, then returned to Sydney and was present for the opening of the [[Sydney Opera House]] on 20 October.&lt;ref name=Bastock324&gt;Bastock, ''Australia's Ships of War'', p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vampire'' began 1974 by participating in a joint Australia-Indonesia military exercise, before sailing to the Coral Sea in June to participate in [[Exercise Kangaroo]] I.&lt;ref name=Cassells148/&gt; In September 1974, the ship entered Garden Island Dockyard for an eight-month refit.&lt;ref name=Cassells148/&gt;

On 22 August 1975, ''Vampire'', sister ship {{HMAS|Vendetta|D08|6}}, and the supply ship {{HMAS|Supply|AO 195|6}} were prepositioned in Darwin following tensions between Indonesia and the former Portuguese colony of East Timor (which cumulated in the Indonesian [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] in December).&lt;ref name=Cassells148/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones231&gt;Jones, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; The ships were to evacuate Australian citizens and Timorese refugees if needed, but this did not eventuate.&lt;ref name=Cassells148/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones231/&gt; On 21 September, the destroyer left Darwin for a five-month Strategic Reserve deployment.&lt;ref name=Cassells148/&gt; During her fifth deployment, which ended with her return to Sydney on 18 February 1976, ''Vampire'' joined training exercises with United States Navy ships in the China Sea, and visited sixteen ports in six countries for diplomatic and goodwill purposes.&lt;ref name=Cassells148/&gt; On 31 May 1976, ''Vampire'' and the destroyer escort {{HMAS|Stuart|DE 48|6}} departed Sydney Harbour for the United States.&lt;ref name=Cassells148/&gt; The two ships, along with the destroyer {{HMAS|Hobart|D 39|6}}, visited ports along the west coast of the United States as the RAN representatives during the [[United States Bicentennial]]: ''Vampire'' visited [[Long Beach, California]] and [[Seattle, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassells, ''The Destroyers'', pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vampire'' returned to Sydney on 6 August, but departed seven days later to participate in exercises in South East Asia.&lt;ref name=Cassells149&gt;Cassells, ''The Destroyers'', p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

During the visit of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Phillip]] to Australia in March 1977, ''Vampire'' was assigned as the escort to [[HMY Britannia|Her Majesty's Yacht ''Britannia'']].&lt;ref name=Cassells149/&gt; ''Vampire'' met ''Britannia'' on 11 March, and accompanied the royal yacht to Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Fremantle.&lt;ref name=Cassells149/&gt; Between April and July 1977, ''Vampire'' was involved in two rescue missions and three fleet training exercises.&lt;ref name=Cassells149/&gt; On 5 September, ''Vampire'' left Sydney as "part of the RAN contribution to Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee."&lt;ref name=Cassells149/&gt; The destroyer returned on 18 October.&lt;ref name=Cassells149/&gt; At the end of 1977, ''Vampire'' participated in Exercise Compass 77, held off Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=Cassells149/&gt; The destroyer was primarily involved in training exercises during 1978 and 1979.&lt;ref name=Cassells149/&gt;

In April 1979, it was announced that ''Vampire'' would be converted into a training ship.&lt;ref name=Cassells149/&gt; This refit was carried out from 21 January to 18 April 1980, and included the removal of the destroyer's M22 fire control radars, LW-02 air search radar, Limbo anti-submarine mortar, and twin Bofors mounts, and the installation of a training classroom where the Limbo previously resided.&lt;ref name=Cassells149/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, ''HMAS Vampire'', pgs. 8, 10&lt;/ref&gt; Following the conversion, ''Vampire'' was assigned to the RAN training squadron, where she joined {{HMAS|Jervis Bay|GT 203|6}}.&lt;ref name=Cassells149/&gt; On 13 May, ''Vampire'' and ''Jervis Bay'' were ordered to the Solomon Islands to observe the splashdown of China's first intercontinental ballistic missile test-firing.&lt;ref name=Lind296&gt;Lind, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; The ICBM landed north-west of Fiji, and was observed by both the two Australian ships and a fleet of 18 warships from the [[People's Liberation Army Navy]].&lt;ref name=Lind296/&gt; On 6 November 1980, the two ships joined the patrol boats {{HMAS|Aware|P 91|2}} and {{HMAS|Ardent|P 87|2}} to perform a ceremonial entry into Darwin as part of the city's Navy Week.&lt;ref name=Cassells149/&gt;

==Decommissioning and preservation==
On 25 June 1986, ''Vampire'' left active service.&lt;ref name=Cassells149/&gt; She was decommissioned on 13 August 1986, having spent 27 years in service, and travelled {{convert|808026|nmi|km}}.&lt;ref name=brooke/&gt; She was later presented to the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]] for preservation as a [[museum ship]]: on loan from 1990 to 1997, then transferred outright in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, ''HMAS Vampire'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vampire'' is the largest museum piece on display in Australia.&lt;ref name=ShawHist19/&gt; The ship is also used for training RAN divers in hull clearance.&lt;ref name=ShawHist19/&gt; In 1994, two disabled twin Bofors mounts were returned to the destroyer, replacing those removed in 1980.&lt;ref name=Shaw10/&gt; On 9 April 1997, permission was granted for ''Vampire'' to fly the [[Australian White Ensign]], despite not being a commissioned warship.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, ''HMAS Vampire'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The destroyer is towed to {{HMAS|Kuttabul|naval base|6}} every five years for maintenance and cleaning.&lt;ref name=ShawHist19&gt;Shaw, ''Historic RAN ships in Australia'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; During a docking in October 2006, rumours spread among RAN personnel that ''Vampire'' would be refitted and returned to active service.&lt;ref name=brooke&gt;Brooke, ''Destroyer revamped''&lt;/ref&gt; During the same refit, a fire broke out in the ship's boiler room.&lt;ref name=DTfire&gt;Pride of naval museum catches fire, ''The Daily Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody was injured, and no irreparable damage was caused.&lt;ref name=DTfire/&gt;

An overhaul of the RAN [[battle honour]]s system completed in March 2009 saw ''Vampire'' retroactively honoured for her service in the Strategic Reserve between 1964 and 1966—the time of the [[Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation]].&lt;ref name=newhonours&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/Navy_Marks_109th_Birthday_With_Historic_Changes_To_Battle_Honours |title=Navy Marks 109th Birthday With Historic Changes To Battle Honours |date=1 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613184920/http://www.navy.gov.au/Navy_Marks_109th_Birthday_With_Historic_Changes_To_Battle_Honours |archivedate=13 June 2011 |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=honourslist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Units_entitlement_list.pdf |title=Royal Australian Navy Ship/Unit Battle Honours |date=1 March 2010 |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614064156/http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Units_entitlement_list.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2011 |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any future ships named HMAS ''Vampire'' will carry the battle honour "Malaysia 1964–66" in addition to the honours earned by [[HMAS Vampire (D68)|the previous HMAS ''Vampire'']].&lt;ref name=honourslist/&gt;

In November 2015, the warship was moved to the new Warships Pavilion 'Action Stations' at the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]] alongside [[HMAS Onslow]] and [[HMAS Advance]].

The '''Harry Ransom Center''' is an [[archive]], [[library]] and [[museum]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], specializing in the collection of literary and cultural artifacts from the [[United States]] [[Latin America]] and [[Europe]] for the purpose of advancing the study of the [[Visual arts|arts]] and [[humanities]]. The Ransom Center houses 36 million literary [[manuscripts]], one million [[rare books]], five million [[photographs]], and more than 100,000 works of [[art]]. 

The Center has a reading room for scholars and galleries which display rotating exhibitions of works and objects from the collections. In the 2015-2016 academic year, the center hosted nearly 6,000 research visits resulting in the publication of over 145 books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/about/director/pdf/Annual_Report_2015-2016.pdf|title=Annual Report 2015-2016|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Harry Ransom Center|access-date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Harry Ransom]] founded the Humanities Research Center in 1957 with the ambition of expanding the rare books and manuscript holdings of the University of Texas. He acquired the Edward Alexander Parsons Collection,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/collections/books/holdings/parsons/ Edward Alexander Parsons Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; the T. Edward Hanley Collection,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/collections/books/holdings/hanley/ T. Edward Hanley Library]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Norman Bel Geddes]] Collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/belgeddes.bio.html Normal Bel Geddes Theater and Industrial Design Papers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lewis, Anne S.|title=Normal Bel Geddes, Harry Ransom Center, Future Perfect exhibition|journal=Wall Street Journal|date=September 10, 2012|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443864204577619583304460886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ransom himself was the official director of the Center for only the years 1958 to 1961, but he directed and presided over a period of great expansion in the collections until his resignation in 1971 as Chancellor of the University of Texas System. The Center moved into its current building in 1972.

F. Warren Roberts was the official director from 1961 to 1976 and acquired the [[Helmut Gernsheim]] Collection of photographs, the archives of [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[John Steinbeck]], and [[Evelyn Waugh]], and in 1968 the Carlton Lake Collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndbooks.com/author/carlton-lake Carlton Lake brief bio from "New Directions"] Carlton Lake (1915–2006) was the Paris art critic for the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Roberts's tenure, John Payne and then Carlton Lake served as interim directors from 1976 to 1980.  It was during this time (in 1978) that the Center acquired its complete copy of the Gutenberg Bible.

In 1980, the Center hired [[Decherd Turner]] as director. Turner acquired the Giorgio Uzielli Collection of [[Aldine Press|Aldine editions]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/collections/books/holdings/aldine/ Aldine Press] Giorgio Uzielli was a New York stockbroker and book collector, born in Florence, Italy. After a 1982 visit to the Harry Ransom Center, he wrote into his will a bequest to the Center of his 287 books printed by the Aldine Press in Venice in the 15th and 16th centuries. Uzielli's gift was appraised at about $2 million.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Anne Sexton]] archive, the [[Robert Lee Wolff]] Collection of 19th-century fiction, the Pforzheimer Collection,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/collections/books/holdings/pforzheimer/ Carl H. Pforzheimer Library]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[David O. Selznick]] archive, the [[Gloria Swanson]] archive, and the [[Ernest Lehman]] Collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/collections/film/holdings/lehman/ Ernest Lehman Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Decherd Turner's retirement in 1988, Thomas F. Staley became director of the Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/press/releases/2010/staley_timeline.html Director Thomas F. Staley: Major Acquisitions and Achievements]&lt;/ref&gt; Staley had acquired the Woodward and Bernstein Watergate Papers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/web/woodstein/ Woodward and Bernstein Watergate Papers]&lt;/ref&gt; a copy of the [[Plantin Polyglot|Plantin Polyglot Bible]], and more than 100 literary archives. In September 2013, Stephen Enniss was appointed director of the Ransom Center. Enniss was formerly the Head Librarian of the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/ransomedition/2013/fall/enniss.html "Stephen Enniss appointed new director of Ransom Center"], Harry Ransom Center.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Enniss the Ransom Center has continued to collect several archives, including [[Kazuo Ishiguro]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/arts/2015-08-25/the-remains-of-the-papers/ "The Remains of the Papers"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Miller]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/article/harry-ransom-center-acquires-arthur-miller-archive "Harry Ransom Center Acquires Arthur Miller Archive"]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ian McEwan]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/15/ian-mcewan-literary-archive-harry-ransom-center-2m-dollars "Ian McEwan's literary archive bought by Harry Ransom Center"]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Notable collections==
The two most prominent items in the Ransom Center's collections are a [[Gutenberg Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/gutenberg Gutenberg Bible, permanent exhibit at HRC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Luxist.com"&gt;Luxist.com: [http://www.luxist.com/2008/01/31/the-world-of-rare-books-the-gutenberg-bible-first-and-most-val/ The World of Rare Books: The Gutenberg Bible, First and Most Valuable] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410171301/http://www.luxist.com/2008/01/31/the-world-of-rare-books-the-gutenberg-bible-first-and-most-val |date=2013-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (one of only 21 complete copies known to exist) and [[Nicéphore Niépce]]'s ''[[View from the Window at Le Gras]]'', the first successful permanent photograph from nature. Both of these objects are on permanent display in the main lobby.

Beyond these, the Center houses many culturally important documents and artifacts. Particular strengths include modern literature, performing arts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/collections/performingarts/ Performing Arts - Harry Ransom Center]&lt;/ref&gt; and photography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/collections/photography/ Photography - Harry Ransom Center]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the Gutenberg Bible and the photograph, notable holdings include:

'''Ichchadhari Naag''' (male) or '''Naagin''' (female) are mythical [[shape-shifting]] cobras in Indian folklore. These creatures would obtain their power by living for 100 years and not biting any living beings. Some of these who are offsprings of a pair from their birth have such power. The first such creature was a female who was by birth a Naagin. She was created by Lord Shiv. In some folklore this story prevails. They prefer to be in the form of a human being most of the time.&lt;ref name="Berninger2010"&gt;{{cite book | author=Mark Berninger | title=Comics As a Nexus of Cultures: Essays on the Interplay of Media, Disciplines and International Perspectives | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-aWWTZeergC&amp;pg=PA180 | accessdate=6 December 2012 | date=30 May 2010 | publisher=McFarland | isbn=978-0-7864-3987-4 | page=180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ichchadhari Naag, in snake form, possess a gem called "Naag Mani", considered much more valuable than a [[Diamond (gemstone)|diamond]]. Legends tell of many people losing their lives through snake bites, when the snakes took revenge for stolen Mani, or if either of a pair of snakes was killed. According to legend, the snakes can be controlled using [[Pungi|Been]], the musical instrument used by snake charmers. These types of snakes are said to be vengeful and will take revenge on anyone who disturbs them.They are also great devotees of Lord Shiv. Its said that the first of these creatures was created by Lord Shiv while he came out of the pillar when Lord Vishnu and Lord Brahma were fighting on who is superior to whom. {{cn|date = July 2017}}

==Children's comics==

The legends of Ichchhadhari Naag have been used as a plot basis for many comic plot and stories. The [[comic book]] superhero character "[[Nagraj]]" (''"Cobra-King"'') is also based on these legends. There is another famous Hindi comic character, named Tausi, who was a male shape shifting snake. Apart from these, the concept had been used for many children's short stories.{{cn|date = July 2017}}

==Bollywood and Indian TV shows==

Many [[Bollywood]] films incorporate the Ichchhadhari Naag legends, or the character of Nagraj, such as ''[[Nagin (1954 film)|Nagin]]'', [[Sridevi]] in the 1986 film ''[[Nagina (1986 film)|Nagina]]'', and [[Reena Roy]] in ''[[Nagin (1976 film)|Nagin]]'' (1976).

In 2007, a television series called [[Naaginn (2007 TV series)|Naaginn]] began on [[Zee TV]], in which [[Sayantani Ghosh]] played role of an Ichchhadhari Naagin. In 2015, a television series called [[Naagin (2015 TV series)|Naagin]] began, in which [[Mouni Roy]] and [[Adaa Khan]] play the lead role of serpents . This show is running till now and showing the belief of people on Naagins . It had and is gaining TRP day - by - day and had left all shows behind . BARC Report per week always say that ' Naagin retained its first position ' . In 2016, the soap opera [[Ichhapyaari Naagin]] started, starring [[Priyal Gor]] in the lead role of a serpent. In 2016, [[Naagakanya]] started, starring Deepika Das.

Another television series which has shape shifting snake role is [[Nandini (TV series)|Nandini]] which started airing on 23rd January 2017. This series is being simultaneously aired in  four different Indian languages, viz. Tamil (Original version), Kannada (Re-shot), Telugu (dubbed) and Malayalam (dubbed).

== Lollywood and Pakistani TV shows ==

The wooden table and supports were designed to match the [[Teylers Oval Room|Oval Room]] where it was initially kept until the mid 19th century.]]
[[File:Interior Instrument Room Teylers Museum.jpg|thumb|In the second cabinet in the same room are various portable electrostatic generators, each built according to a different design. On the bottom right in the back is the first model by Gerhard Kuyper that Van Marum had built in Groningen, with the mercury bath.]]

The '''large electrostatic generator''' (Dutch: ''Van Marum electriseermachine'') is a large handcrafted electromechanical instrument designed by [[Martin van Marum]] and built by [[John Cuthbertson (instrument maker)|John Cuthbertson]] in 1784 for the [[Teylers Museum]] in Haarlem, where it forms the centerpiece of the [[Teylers Instrument Room|instrument room]]. The concept of an [[electrostatic generator]] was new, and the battery (array) of [[leiden jar]]s was the largest ever built (only one of the 4 sets of leiden jars is on display to conserve space). The two glass disks of the generator are 1.65 meters in diameter, and the machine is capable of generating a potential of 330,000 volts.

==History==
[[File:De zaal der physica van Felix Meritis.jpg|thumb|left|This 1794 demonstration of a smaller electrostatic generator in [[Felix Meritis]] shows the popularity of such devices, though Van Marum's machine was much larger. A copy of this engraving hangs in the Teylers Instrument room near the large electrostatic generator.]]
The device is a larger version of a similar model built in [[Groningen]] by Gerhard Kuyper in 1774 for physics student Martin van Marum, who used it to make a name for himself in the study of electricity with his lectures and demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;Verhandeling over het electrizeeren, Martinus van Marum, Gerhard Kuyper, Voor Rekening van Yntema en Tieboel, boekverkopers te Amsterdam, 1776 (translated into German in 1777 by Johann Wilhelm Möller, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=X4o5AAAAcAAJ  Abhandlung über das Elektrisiren]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Van Marum's dream to create a larger version, and he applied to the [[Teylers Stichting]] in 1783 for funding to create such a large instrument in the hope that it would add a valuable contribution to the science of electricity. On April 11 of that year his request was granted, and on May 7 Cuthbertson was employed who finished the device a year later and it was proudly installed on Christmas Eve. The machine performed above expectations and was only modified a few times to prevent leaks of the static charge. The study of electricity leakage led to many insights in the study of electricity. The machine was last modified in 1791. For the friction, cushions were used as an improvement over the mercury bath used in the earlier model. For a complete description of the electrostatic generator, an explanation was produced in 1868 by the Parisian author [[Adolphe Ganot]] (1804-1887).&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/books?id=DGgxAQAAMAAJ Adolphe Ganot (translator: Edmund Atkinson) on the Wilhelm Holtz elektriseermachine], Elementary Treatise on Physics: Experimental and Applied, 4th ed. Wm. Wood and Co., 61 Walker Street, N.Y., N.Y., 1870, page 634, fig. 479&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Marum himself became curator of the physics cabinet at Teylers in the same year the instrument was ordered to be made. He used it again and again in laboratory lectures to the public and continued to make excursions with his smaller model, which he finally sold to the museum for 120 guilders in 1790.

The '''''United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers' Edition''''', or '''''Lawyers' Edition''''' ('''L. Ed.''' and '''L. Ed. 2d''' in [[case citation]]s) is an unofficial [[law report|reporter]] of [[Supreme Court of the United States]] [[Judicial opinion|opinions]]. The ''Lawyers' Edition'' was established by the [[Lawyers Cooperative Publishing Company]] of [[Rochester, New York]] in 1882, and features coverage of Supreme Court decisions going back to 1790.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Morris L.|last2=O'Connor|first2=Sharon Hamby|title=A Guide to the Early Reports of the Supreme Court of the United States|year=1995|publisher=F.B.

The ''Lawyers' Edition'' differs from the official reporter in that the editors write [[headnote]]s and case summaries, as well as provide annotations to some cases, and decisions are published far in advance of the official reporter. As such, it is similar to [[West (publisher)|West's]] unofficial ''[[Supreme Court Reporter]]'' (S. Ct.). ''Lawyers' Edition'' case reports differ from ''Supreme Court Reporter'' case reports in three respects. First, coverage in ''Supreme Court Reporter'' does not begin until ''[[Johnson v. Waters]]'', 108 U.S. 4 (1882), while ''Lawyers' Edition'' covers opinions back to the first volume of ''United States Reports''. Second, while both reporters contain headnotes written by the reporters' editors, the ''Lawyers' Edition'' headnotes are not keyed to the [[West American Digest System]]'s topic and key number system.&lt;ref name="svengalis" /&gt; Third, ''Lawyers' Edition'' historically included analytical articles, referred to as "annotations", similar to those contained in [[American Law Reports]].  

[[LexisNexis]], by way of [[Reed Elsevier]], acquired the rights to the ''Lawyers' Edition'', along with a number of other law publications and related assets, from [[The Thomson Corporation]] in January 1997. Thomson, in acquiring [[West (publisher)|West Publishing]], was required to divest itself of a large number of titles through a [[consent decree]] by the [[United States Department of Justice]].&lt;ref name="svengalis" /&gt;

The '''Lost Nigger Gold Mine''' is a legendary mine in the [[folklore of the United States]]. According to the legend, in 1887 four brothers in [[Dryden, Texas]]—Frank, Jim, John, and Lee Reagan—hired an illiterate [[Seminole]] man named William Kelly to help with work on their ranch. Kelly was known as "Nigger Bill" (''nigger'' being a term for a multiracial person in the slang of the [[Big Bend (Texas)|Big Bend]] region){{sfn|Braddy|1945|p=360}} and has been identified as a cook{{sfn|"New Search"|1960|p=53}} and also as a horse wrangler; at the time of his employment by the Reagans, he was only 14.{{sfn|Porter|1954|p=19}} While working on the ranch, Kelly announced that he had discovered a gold mine, and was "greeted only with jeers". The next day he again tried to tell the Reagans about the mine, even going so far as to show them a lump of gold ore, but received a "cussing out" for his trouble.{{sfn|Porter|1954|p=13}}

After this rejection, Kelly went to [[San Antonio]], where he knew a white [[Metallurgical assay|assayer]], and asked him to analyze the ore. Stories then conflict: One account states that he returned to Dryden, where the Reagans received a letter addressed to him that confirmed the gold was immensely valuable, and then killed him and dumped his body in the [[Rio Grande]].{{sfn|Braddy|1945|p=360}} The other states that, shortly after returning, he "borrowed" a horse and fled. Whatever the case, the Reagans dedicated their lives to attempting to find the mine; one report from 1930 claims that the three Reagans alive at that point had still not given up on their search.{{sfn|Porter|1954|p=14}} As well as the Reagans, many other expeditions set out in search of the mine; the legend has it that, while some explorers did discover it, they always died before they could make a profit or pass on the information.{{sfn|Porter|1954|p=14}}

One of the more serious searches was instigated by [[William Broderick Cloete]], a British mine owner who believed in the story so completely that he offered Lock Campbell, a Texan man, expenses of $10,000 if he would undertake an expedition to find it.{{sfn|Dobie|1978|p=155}} On July 19, 1899, Campbell and four other men signed an agreement to search for it, and one of the men later claimed to have discovered it in the [[Ladron Peak|Ladrones Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], but this was never verified. In 1909, an Oklahoman named Wattenberg traveled to [[Alpine, Texas]], with a map that he claimed showed the mine to be in Mexico itself; a pioneer named John Young went so far as to enter into partnership with Wattenberg and secure a mining permit from [[Porfirio Díaz]], only to spend years fruitlessly trying to find it.{{sfn|Braddy|1945|p=360}} These failures have led to debates as to what happened to the mine. Young himself believed that it had been deliberately hidden by prospectors following Kelly;{{sfn|Braddy|1945|p=361}} another theory is that the gold was not actually gold ore, but instead pieces of refined gold left by the Spanish.{{sfn|Braddy|1945|p=362}} A third theory is that the gold was dropped by a group of Mexicans fleeing the ''[[rurales]]'', who were forced to abandon it because it was slowing them down. Another is that, as the gold mine was allegedly in a canyon, gravel could have washed down and hidden it from view.{{sfn|Dobie|1978|p=156}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9891">{{Competition law}}
In [[economics]] and particularly in [[industrial organization]], '''market power''' is the ability of a [[theory of the firm|firm]] to profitably raise the [[market price]] of a good or service over [[marginal cost]]. In [[Perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] markets, market participants have no market power. A firm with total market power can raise prices without losing any customers to competitors. Market participants that have market power are therefore sometimes referred to as "price makers" or "price setters", while those without are sometimes called "price takers". Significant market power occurs when prices exceed marginal cost and [[long run average cost]], so the firm makes profit.

A firm with market power has the ability to individually affect either the total quantity or the prevailing price in the market. Price makers face a downward-sloping [[demand curve]], such that price increases lead to a lower quantity demanded. The decrease in supply as a result of the exercise of market power creates an economic [[deadweight loss]] which is often viewed as socially undesirable. As a result, many countries have [[anti-trust]] or other legislation intended to limit the ability of firms to accrue market power. Such legislation often regulates [[merger]]s and sometimes introduces a judicial power to compel [[divestiture]].

A firm usually has market power by virtue of controlling a large portion of the market. In extreme cases—[[monopoly]] and [[monopsony]]—the firm controls the entire market. However, market size alone is not the only indicator of market power. Highly [[Market concentration|concentrated markets]] may be [[contestable market|contestable]] if there are no [[barriers to entry]] or exit, limiting the incumbent firm's ability to raise its price above competitive levels.

Market power gives firms the ability to engage in unilateral [[anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vatiero Massimiliano|year=2010|title=The Ordoliberal notion of market power: an institutionalist reassessment|doi=10.5235/ecj.v6n3.689|journal=European Competition Journal|volume=6|issue=3|pages=689–707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the behaviours that firms with market power are accused of engaging in include [[predatory pricing]], product [[Tying (commerce)|tying]], and creation of [[Capacity utilization|overcapacity]] or other barriers to entry. If no individual participant in the market has significant market power, then anti-competitive behavior can take place only through [[collusion]], or the exercise of a group of participants' collective market power.

The [[Lerner index]] and [[Herfindahl index]] may be used to measure market power.

==Oligopoly==
When several firms control a significant share of market sales, the resulting market structure is called an [[oligopoly]] or [[oligopsony]].  An oligopoly may engage in [[collusion]], either tacit or overt, and thereby exercise market power. A group of firms that explicitly agree to affect market price or output is called a [[cartel]].

==Monopoly power==
[[Monopoly power]] is an example of [[market failure]] which occurs when one or more of the participants has the ability to influence the [[price]] or other outcomes in some general or specialized [[Market (economics)|market]].  The most commonly discussed form of market power is that of a [[monopoly]], but other forms such as [[monopsony]], and more moderate versions of these two extremes, exist.

A well-known example of monopolistic market power is [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] market share in [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] [[operating system]]s. The ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]'' case dealt with an allegation that Microsoft illegally exercised its market power by bundling its [[web browser]] with its operating system.  &lt;!-- A well-known example of monopoly market power is [[Standard Oil]], an oil refining company that held about 90% of the refining capacity in the U.S before it was split up by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1911, but I don't know enough about how Rockefeller abused its market power to use the example. --&gt;
In this respect, the notion of dominance and dominant position in EU Antitrust Law is a strictly related aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Vatiero M. (2009), "An Institutionalist Explanation of Market Dominances". World Competition. Law and Economics Review, 32(2):221–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source==
A monopoly can raise prices and retain customers because the monopoly has no competitors. If a customer has no other place to go to obtain the goods or services, they either pay the increased price or do without.&lt;ref&gt;If the power company raised rates the customer either pays the increase or does without power.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the key to market power is to preclude competition through high barriers of entry. Barriers to entry that are significant sources of market power are control of scarce resources, increasing returns to scale, technological superiority and government created barriers to entry.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Krugman &amp; Wells, Microeconomics 2d ed. (Worth 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[OPEC]] is an example of an organization that has market power due to control over scarce resources&amp;nbsp;— oil. Increasing returns to scale are another important source of market power. Firms experiencing increasing returns to scale are also experiencing decreasing average total costs.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Firms in such industries become more profitable with size.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Therefore over time the industry is dominated by a few large firms. This dominance makes it difficult for start up firms to succeed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Firms like power companies, cable television companies and wireless communication companies with large start up costs fall within this category. A company wishing to enter such industries must have the financial ability to spend millions of dollars before starting operations and generating any revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Often such natural monopolies will also have the benefit of government granted monopolies.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly established firms also have a competitive advantage over new firms. An established firm threatened by a new competitor can lower prices to drive out the competition. Microsoft is a firm that has substantial pricing or market power due to technological superiority in its design and production processes.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Finally government created barriers to entry can be a source of market power. A prime example are patents granted to pharmaceutical companies. These patents give the drug companies a virtual monopoly in the protected product for the term of the patent.

==Measurement==
Concentration ratios are the most common measures of market power.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson &amp; Nordhaus, Microeconomics, 17th ed. (McGraw-Hill 2001) at 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt; The four-firm concentration ratio measures the percentage of total industry output attributable to the top four companies. For monopolies the four firm ratio is 100 per cent while the ratio is zero for perfect competition.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson &amp; Nordhaus, Microeconomics, 17th ed. (McGraw-Hill 2001) at 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The four firm concentration domestic (U.S) ratios for cigarettes is 93%; for automobiles, 84% and for beer, 85%.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Samuelson &amp; Nordhaus, Microeconomics, 17th ed. (McGraw-Hill 2001) at 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another measure of concentration is the [[Herfindahl index|Herfindahl-Hirschman Index]] (HHI) which is calculated by "summing the squares of the percentage market shares of all participants in the market".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The HHI index for perfect competition is zero; for monopoly, 10,000.

U.S. courts almost never consider a firm to possess market power if it has a market share of less than 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gregory Sidak &amp; Hal J. Singer, ''Überregulation Without Economics: The World Trade Organization’s Decision in the U.S.-Mexico Arbitration on Telecommunications Services, General Agreement on Trade in Services, GATS'', 57 FED. COMM. L.J. 1, 34 (2004), http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1388&amp;context=fclj.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elasticity of demand==
Market power is the ability to raise price above [[marginal cost]] (MC) and earn a positive profit.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Perloff, J: Microeconomics Theory &amp; Applications with Calculus page 369. Pearson 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which a firm can raise price (P) above marginal cost depends on the shape of the demand curve at the profit maximizing output.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; That is, elasticity is the critical factor in determining market power. The relationship between market power and the [[price elasticity of demand]] (PED) can be summarized by the equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{P}{MC}=\frac{PED}{1+PED}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that PED will be negative, so the ratio is always greater than one. The higher the P/MC ratio, the more market power the firm possesses. As PED increases in magnitude, the P/MC ratio approaches one, and market power approaches zero.&lt;ref&gt;Perloff, J: Microeconomics Theory &amp; Applications with Calculus Pearson 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
The equation is derived from the monopolist pricing rule:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{P-MC}{P}=-\frac 1 {PED}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:MattheusSilvaticiBotanicGarden.jpg|thumb|Matthaeus Silvaticus teaching his students about medicinal plants in his physic garden in Salerno, from the frontispiece to a 1526 edition of ''Opus Pandectarum Medicinae'']]

'''Matthaeus Silvaticus''' or '''Mattheus Sylvaticus''' (c. 1280 – c. 1342) was a medieval Latin medical writer and botanist.

==Life==
Silvaticus was born in northern Italy, probably [[Mantua]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/dictionnairehist04eloy#page/276/mode/1up ''Dictionnaire historique de la médecine ancienne et moderne''], by N.F.J. Eloy (year 1778).&lt;/ref&gt; He was a student and teacher in botany and medicine at the [[School of Salerno]] in southern Italy.

==Encyclopedia==
He is noted for writing a 650-page encyclopedia about medicating agents (a [[pharmacopoeia]]) which he completed about year 1317 under the Latin title ''Pandectarum Medicinae'' or ''Pandectae Medicinae'' (English: ''Encyclopedia of Medicines''). Most of the medicating agents were botanicals ("herbal medicines"). The presentation is in alphabetical order. The bulk of the manuscript is compiled from earlier medicine books, including books by [[Dioscorides]], [[Avicenna]], [[Serapion the Younger]], and [[Simon of Genoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| title = The Encyclopedia of Medicaments - Pandectarum Medicinae
| work = World Digital Library
| date = May 11, 2013
| accessdate = 2014-03-01
| url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/10665/#languages=lat
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an indication of its popularity in late medieval Europe, the ''Pandectarum Medicinae'' was printed in at least eleven editions in various countries between the [[movable type|invention of the printing press]] and 1500.&lt;ref name=cheung&gt;''Pandectarum Medicinae'' at http://www.interzone.com/~cheung/SUM.dir/med43.html. A number of 15th century editions of the ''Pandectarum'' are online at [http://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/index.html?suchbegriff=Matthaeus+Silvaticus&amp;c=suchen Digitale-Sammlungen.de].&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Medical school==
The medical school in Salerno was influenced by Arabic-to-Latin translations of Arabic medical literature. As one indication of Arabic influence, 233 of 487 plant names that Matthaeus used were Latinizations of Arabic plant names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.summagallicana.it/lessico/s/Silvatico%20Matteo%20-%20Sylvaticus%20Matthaeus%20-%20Silvaticus%20Matthaeus.htm Matteo Silvatico @ SummaGallicana.it] (in Italian language).&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those Latinized Arabic names had little circulation in Latin. Native Latin names existed for some of them, in which case Matthaeus also presents the native Latin name as well. In some cases he prefers to give primary status to the Arabic name in preference to the classical Latin name. In other cases he gives primary status to the Latin name and just mentions what the Arabic name is. 

==European pharmacology==
The ''Pandectarum Medicinae'' is an encyclopedia with almost no original thinking. It has considerable value to historians as a document reflecting the state of pharmacology and medicine in Europe in the late medieval era. The method of presentation in ''Pandectarum Medicinae'' is that a medicinal substance is named together with very brief identifying information and then follows several lengthier summaries or quotations from several well-known medical authorities about the substance's properties and uses. The medical authorities are either (A) the particular ancient Greek medical writers that were widely read by the medieval Arabs (particularly Diosorides and Galen) or else (B) Arabic medical writers (particularly Serapion the Younger and Avicenna).

==Simon of Genoa==
Part of Matthaeus's encyclopedia was taken from a shorter work by Simon of Genoa (aka Simon Januensis) entitled ''Synonyma Medicinae'', which was written a few decades earlier and which is a dictionary of medicines rather than an encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;A late-15th-century edition of Simon of Genoa's ''Synonyma Medicinae'' is online at [https://books.google.com/books?id=7s28XX0mqAUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books] (in Latin). A 19th-century publication of a 15th-century Latin medical botany dictionary called the ''Alphita'' contains, in its 19th-century footnotes, many cross-references to Mattheus Silvaticus and Simon Januensis. It is downloadable at [https://archive.org/stream/sinonomabartholo01mirfuoft#page/n60/mode/1up ''Alphita''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The mill went out of use in 1957.  In 1970 a decision was made to move it to St Fagans, where it opened to the public in 1977.

The name of the mill originates in the Welsh language as "Woodenbridge mill", "Bompren" is a development on "Bont Pren" which means "Wooden Bridge".

The mill is sometimes occupied by a skilled miller, who operates the grinding mill and explains its workings to visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.gtj.org.uk/en/item1/28945 Gathering the Jewels: The Melin Bompren Corn Mill, St Fagans] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131001174045/http://education.gtj.org.uk/en/item1/28945 |date=2013-10-01 }}.

The '''''Nikon Chronicle''''' or '''''Patriarch's Chronicle''''' ({{lang-ru|Никоновская летопись, Патриаршья летопись}}) is a massive compilation and edition of [[letopis|East Slavic chronicles]] undertaken at the court of [[Ivan the Terrible]] in the mid-16th century. The compilation was named after [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus']] [[Patriarch Nikon|Nikon]], who owned a copy. In the 18th century it was published under the name '''''The Russian Chronicle According to Nikon's Manuscript'''''.

The chronicle covers the years from 859 to 1520, with additional information for 1521-1558, as well as many detailed tales about the most important events, such as "Tale of the [[Battle of the Neva]]", "Tale of the [[Battle of the Ice]]", "Tale of the [[Tokhtamysh]] Invasion", "Tale of the Death of [[Mikhail of Tver]]," etc. Some of these tales have obvious parallels with Russian [[folklore]] and Orthodox [[hagiography]].&lt;ref name="ost"/&gt;

The chronicle contains a large number of facts not found in earlier sources. Some of these interpolations are thought to reflect a political ideology of the nascent [[Tsardom of Russia]].&lt;ref name="ost"&gt;Donald Ostrowski.

&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th-century [[Polovtsy]] and the 16th-century [[Kazan Tatars]], for instance, are regularly conflated.

The '''Peirce–Nichols House''' is a [[historic house museum]] located at 80 Federal Street in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts]].  Designed early in the career of noted Salem builder [[Samuel McIntire]] (1757–1811), and modified later by him, the building gives a unique view into the methods and styles of McIntire.  It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1973 for its significance as an early masterwork of one the country's first recognized master builders.  It is now owned by the [[Peabody Essex Museum]].

==History==
Jerathmiel Peirce (1747–1827), began his career as a leather dresser. In about 1778, he formed a partnership with Aaron Waite, and purchased a two-gun schooner, the ''Greyhound'', to serve as a [[privateer]] against British merchant vessels in the Revolutionary War. The partnership prospered, and over the next half a century, purchased/built at least 10 vessels, sending them to ports around the world. In 2000, the National Park Service had a full-scale replica of one of the Waite &amp; Peirce ships built, the ''[[Friendship of Salem]]'', which is the centerpiece of Salem Maritime National Historic Site. Waite and Peirce were also major investors in the newly incorporated Beverly Bank, and were members of Salem's merchant aristocracy. [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] was a major center of trade in the early 1800s, and as a result of this, was the home of America's first millionaire, and on a per-capita basis, was the richest city in America. Peirce went from humble beginnings to owning one of the finest homes in Salem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frayler|first= John|title=Partners for Eternity - Pickled Fish and Salted Provisions: Historical Musings from Salem Maritime NHS|volume= I, No. 7|date= September 1999 |url=https://www.nps.gov/sama/learn/historyculture/upload/Vol1no7Partners.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate= September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pulsifer|first= Susan Farley Nichols|title= Witch's Breed: The Peirce-Nichols Family of Salem|pages= 44-7, 54-6, 197-8, 202-3, 256-7, 379-83, 398-401, 403-6, 418-9|publisher= Dresser, Chapman &amp; Grimes|location= Cambridge, Massachusetts|year= 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Gerald W.

Peirce later suffered financial misfortune and was forced to sell the house.&lt;ref name="Nichols, George pp. 62-3"/&gt; It was purchased by friends, who willed it to the children of George and Sally (Peirce) Nichols. The house remained in the Nichols family until 1917, when it was sold to the [[Essex Institute]],&lt;ref name=MACRIS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=SAL.1645|title=MACRIS inventory record for Peirce–Nichols House|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; predecessor to the [[Peabody Essex Museum]]. It was opened to the public in the late 1930s after the last of the Nichols owners died.
[[File:Friendship asail (15728504423).jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Friendship of Salem]]'']]

McIntire patterned the design of the house fairly closely on patterns found in the ''Builder's Treasury'' of [[Batty Langley]], published in 1740. As a result, the house has late Georgian styling.&lt;ref name=NHL&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=68000041}}|title=NRHP nomination for Peirce–Nichols House|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was altered in some portions in 1801, when Peirce again hired McIntire to redo the hallway east parlor in preparation for the wedding of his daughter Sally to George Nichols. This area features the lighter Federal styling that was being popularized by architect [[Charles Bulfinch]].&lt;ref name=MACRIS /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichols, George pp. 12, 99"/&gt;

[[File:Jerathmeel Peirce Place, 80 Federal Street, Salem (Essex County, Massachusetts).jpg|thumb|left|View from the side (HABS photo, 1940)]]

The house property was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1968,&lt;ref name="nris" /&gt; cited as a particularly elegant example of late Georgian craftsmanship, and for its association with McIntire.&lt;ref name=NHL /&gt; It is also a contributing element of Salem's [[Chestnut Street District]].&lt;ref name=MACRIS /&gt; The Peabody Essex Museum offers tours of the house.

==Description==
The Peirce–Nichols House is a three-story wood-frame building sheathed in clapboards. It has a low pitch hipped roof that is encircled by a low balustrade at the cornice, which further has a central flat section that functions as a roof deck and is also surrounded by a balustrade.  The corners of the building are decorated by fluted Doric pilasters rising the height of the building.  The front entry is in the center bay (of five), and is sheltered by a pedimented porch supported by Doric columns set on a brownstone step.  Large twin chimneys rise through the interior of the house.  The windows on the first two floors feature 6 over 6 sashes, while the third floor has typical foreshortened 3 over 6 sashes.&lt;ref name=MACRIS/&gt;

Behind the house is a carriage house which is thought to date from the same time as the house.  Its symmetrical front facade is divided into three sections, the center one featuring a projecting triangular pediment.  The flanking sections are also pedimented, and are punctuated by round arched openings topped by keystones.&lt;ref name=MACRIS/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10284">A '''reference interview''' is a conversation between a [[librarian]] and a [[library]] user, usually at a [[library reference desk|reference desk]], in which the librarian responds to the user's initial explanation of his or her information need by first attempting to clarify that need and then by directing the user to appropriate information resources.

==Definition==
Bopp &amp; Smith (1995) defines the reference interview as the "conversation between a member of the library reference staff and a library user for the purpose of clarifying the user’s needs and aiding the user in meeting those needs".{{sfnp|Bopp|Smith|1995|p=37}} 

According to ODLIS, the reference interview is "the interpersonal communication that occurs between a reference librarian and a library user to determine the person's specific information need(s), which may turn out to be different from the reference question as initially posed...A reference interview may occur in person, by telephone, or electronically (usually via e-mail) at the request of the user, but a well-trained reference librarian will sometimes initiate communication if a hesitant user appears to need assistance".{{sfnp|Reitz|2014}}

== Parts of a reference interview ==

The reference interview is structured to help the librarian provide answers to the library user. In general, the interview is composed of the following stages.{{sfnp|Ross|Nilsen|Dewdney|2002|p=3}}

#Welcoming
#Gathering general information from the user and getting an overview of the problem
#Confirming the exact question
#Intervention, such as giving information, advice or instructions
#Finishing, including feedback and summary

These stages may occur in loops, for example when a clarification of the question leads to the need to establish more background information on the query topic. These steps are designed to put the user at their ease, and then help ensure that they have correctly explained what they require. When the reference librarian believes that the query is fully understood, they attempt to provide resources that help satisfy it. An important and often overlooked final step is checking that the information or service provided was indeed what the library user required.

==Reference interview techniques==

The purpose behind the reference interview structure is to ensure that the library user's [[information need]] is satisfied. The librarian can use a number of interview techniques to help identify the user's exact need. Poor reference interview skills may lead to misinterpretation of the real question, a lack of real help and an unsatisfied library user.{{sfnp|Nilsen|2005|p=3}}

Librarians use many techniques to help identify a user’s information need. With body language, repetition and paraphrasing of what the user says, the interviewer can encourage the user to give more information about what they need. Asking open questions establishes context and helps to identify exactly what is required. A lack of follow-up, or checking that the user found what they required, is arguably one of the most common mistakes made in the reference interview.{{sfnp|Nilsen|2005|p=6}}

==Forming the query==

One of the biggest problems with providing an effective reference service is that of badly formed queries. In this instance, the user's reference question doesn't match up to the information they actually need.{{sfnp|Fields|2006|pp=405-420}} Badly formed queries may lead to user frustration, as they perceive that the reference interview is not solving their problem. 

Many of the techniques used in the reference interview are geared towards developing a badly formed query until a sense of the user's true information need is gained. A great degree of care must be taken when helping users to develop their query. The librarian typically has little insight into the social and psychological barriers that might be preventing the user from explaining their question accurately. Anything from anxiety from an approaching deadline to lack of confidence with language can get in the way.{{sfnp|Murphy|2005|pp=247-252}}

==The virtual reference interview==
{{main| Virtual reference}}
 
As libraries have begun to adopt electronic technology into their operations, the idea of the virtual reference interview has come to light. Virtual reference is a reference service initiated electronically, often in real-time. The user and librarian do not meet face-to-face. Virtual reference services can be conducted, for example, in internet chat, videoconferencing, email, [[cobrowsing|co-browsing]] and [[instant messaging]]. 

Uptake of virtual reference has not been as swift as some had predicted. The complexity of virtual reference may be to blame, as users want information quickly and with the minimum of fuss.{{sfnp|Stormont|2007|p=119}} Some evidence suggests that the problem lies with poor uptake and training among library staff.{{sfnp|Nilsen|2005|p=8}}

==Library users and reference services==

Library users are not always comfortable with reference services, let alone satisfied with them. [[Unobtrusive measures|Unobtrusive user studies]] suggest that only around 55% to 65% of users leave a reference interview satisfied with the result and willing to return.{{sfnp|Nilsen|2005|p=3}} Demographics, social factors and users’ preconceptions about libraries all contribute to this figure. Embarrassment, shyness, and anxiety can prevent a user from approaching the reference desk, and poor signposting and explanation of services can mean that some customers aren't aware that the reference service exists. To be as effective as possible, libraries must be proactive in publicizing their services and reducing the stigma of asking for help.{{sfnp|Robinson|Reid|2007|pp=405-424}}

==Usefulness of the reference interview==

For a long time, the value of the reference interview has stood unquestioned. More recently, with technological developments streamlining some of the tasks which once comprised the interview, some researchers are beginning to question the validity of the reference interview, and the investment that a reference librarian represents.{{sfnp|Ryan|2008|pp=389-399}} Others argue that reference services should broaden their target audience. As people increasingly use the internet to make major, life-affecting decisions, so they also require the services of  professionals who are able to provide help in this environment.{{sfnp|Janes|2003|pp=22-25}} If this proves to be the case, it will become more vital that the reference interview be conducted professionally and successfully. In the age of [[information overload]], a successful reference interview may empower users to confidently make such decisions in their lives.

'''''Roald Amundsen's South Pole Journey''''' ({{lang-no|Roald Amundsens sydpolsferd}}) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] documentary film that features [[Roald Amundsen]]'s original footage from his [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|South Pole expedition]] from 1910 to 1912. The film was seen for the first time in 1912 and it was used by Amundsen for his traveling lectures.&lt;ref name="Fa"&gt;[http://www.filmarkivet.no/film/details.aspx?filmid=400160 ''Roald Amundsens sydpolsferd'' at Filmarkivet.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was added to [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World]] register in 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-7/roald-amundsens-south-pole-expedition-1910-1912/ UNESCO Memory of the World: Roald Amundsen's South Pole Expedition (1910−1912).]&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the few films to be listed in it.&lt;ref name="Nfi"&gt;[http://www.nfi.no/sefilm/roald-amundsens-sydpolsferd-1910-1912 Norsk filminstitutt. 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7410">[[Image:Uthman Koran Taschkent a.jpg|thumb|250px|The Samarkand manuscript, now kept in [[Tashkent]]]]
The '''Samarkand Kufic Quran''' (also known as the '''Uthman Quran''', '''Samarkand codex''', '''Samarkand manuscript''' and '''Tashkent Quran''') is an 8th or 9th century [[manuscript]] [[Quran]] written in the territory of modern Iraq in the [[Kufic|Kufic script]]. Today it is kept in the [[Hast Imam library]], in [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]].

In local [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] tradition, it is said to have belonged to the third [[Four Righteously Guided Caliphs|caliph]], [[Uthman ibn Affan]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian MacWilliam|title=Tashkent's hidden Islamic relic|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4581684.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=2006-01-05 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating the Manuscript==
Based on [[orthography|orthographic]] and [[Palaeography|palaeographic]] studies, the manuscript probably dates the 8th or 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The "Qur'ān Of ʿUthmān" At Tashkent (Samarqand), Uzbekistan, From 2nd Century Hijra|url=http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Text/Mss/samarqand.html|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kunstkamera.ru"&gt;E. A. Rezvan, "On The Dating Of An “'Uthmanic Qur'an” From St. Petersburg", ''Manuscripta Orientalia'', 2000, Volume 6, No. 3, pp. 19-22.[http://www.kunstkamera.ru/files/lib/978-5-88431-178-7/978-5-88431-178-7_12.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Radio-carbon dating showed a 95.4% probability of a date between 765 and 855.&lt;ref name="kunstkamera.ru"/&gt; However, one of the folios from another manuscript (held in the Religious Administration of Muslims in Tashkent) was dated to between 595 and 855 A.D. with a likelihood of 95%.&lt;ref name="kunstkamera.ru" /&gt;

== History ==
The copy of the Quran is traditionally considered to be one of a group commissioned by the third caliph Uthman; however, this attribution has been questioned. In 651, 19 years after the death of the Islamic Prophet, [[Muhammad]], Uthman commissioned a committee to produce a standard copy of the text of the Quran (see [[Origin and development of the Quran]]).&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Five of these authoritative Qurans were sent to the major Muslim cities of the era, and Uthman kept one for his own use in [[Medina]], although the Samarkand Quran is most likely not one of those copies. The [[Topkapi manuscript|only other surviving copy]] was thought to be the one held in [[Topkapı Palace]] in [[Turkey]],&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jP850CjN_voC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;vq=uthman+topkapi&amp;dq=topkapi+quran+uthman&amp;as_brr=0&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=ACfU3U3NWsJjnotslerbjWEq1LUniEgvxw|title=Architectural Conservation in Islam: Case Study of the Prophet's Mosque|first=Syed Ahmad Iskandar Syed|last=Ariffin|date=19 June 2017|publisher=Penerbit UTM|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; but studies have shown that the Topkapı manuscript is also not from the 7th century, but from much later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corpuscoranicum.de/handschriften/index/sure/1/vers/1/?handschrift=52|title=Corpus Coranicum|website=corpuscoranicum.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ircica.org/al-mushaf-al-sharif-attributed-to-uthman-bin-affan/irc788.aspx|title=Al-Mushaf Al-Sharif Attributed to 'Uthman bin 'Affan|website=www.ircica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uthman was succeeded by [[Ali]], who took the uthmanic Quran to [[Kufa]], now in [[Iraq]]. The subsequent history of this Quran is known only from legends. According to one of them, when [[Timur|Tamerlane]] destroyed the area, he took the Quran to his capital, [[Samarkand]], as a treasure. According to another, the Quran was brought from the caliph of Rum to Samarkand by [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]] Ahrar, a Turkestani [[sufi]] master, as a gift after he had cured the caliph. 
 
The Quran remained in the Khoja Ahrar Mosque of Samarkand for four centuries until 1869, when the Russian general Abramov bought it from the [[mullah]]s of the mosque and gave it to [[Konstantin von Kaufman]], Governor-General of Turkestan, who in turn sent it to the Imperial Library in [[Saint Petersburg]] (now the [[Russian National Library]]).&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; It attracted the attention of Orientalists and eventually a facsimile edition was published in Saint-Petersburg in 1905. The 50 copies soon became rarities. The first thorough description and dating of the manuscript was undertaken by the Russian Orientalist Shebunin in 1891.

[[Image:Kufic Quran, sura 7, verses 86-87.jpg|thumb|The Uthman Quran, Sura 7 ''(Ala'araf),'' verses 86 and 87]]

After the [[October Revolution]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], in an act of goodwill to the [[Muslim]]s of Russia, gave the Quran to the people of [[Ufa]], [[Bashkortostan]]. After repeated appeals by the people of the [[Turkestan ASSR]], the Quran was returned to [[Central Asia]], to Tashkent, in 1924, where it has since remained.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

== Current state ==
The [[parchment]] manuscript now is held in the library of the Telyashayakh Mosque, in the old "Hast-Imam" (Khazrati Imom) area of [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]], close to the grave of [[Kaffal Shashi]], a 10th-century  [[Islamic scholar]].

A folio containing a page from the sura [[Al-Anbiya]] is held at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/454661|title=Folio from the "Tashkent Qur'an" - The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript is incomplete:&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; it begins in the middle of verse 7 of the second sura and ends at Surah 43:10.  The manuscript has between eight and twelve lines to the page and, showing its antiquity, the text is devoid of [[Arabic diacritics|vocalisation]].

'''''Sancai Tuhui''''', compiled by Wang Qi ({{zh|c=王圻}}) and his son Wang Siyi ({{zh|s=王思义}}), is a Chinese ''[[leishu]]'' encyclopedia, completed in 1607 and published in 1609 during the [[Ming dynasty]], featuring illustrations of subjects in the three worlds of heaven, earth, and humanity.

==Title==
The title of this encyclopedia has been variously translated into English as “Illustrations of the Three Powers”,&lt;ref&gt;http://ibs001.colo.firstnet.net.uk/britishlibrary/controller/subjectidsearch?id=8190&amp;idx=1&amp;start=4{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; “Collected Illustrations of the Three Realms”, “Pictorial Compendium of the Three Powers”, and others; in the original title, “Sancai” refers to the three realms of “heaven, earth, and man”, and “Tuhui” literally means “collection of illustrations”.

==Description==
This encyclopedia is organized into 106 chapters in 14 categories ([[astronomy]], [[geography]], [[biography|biographies]], [[history]], [[biology]], and such), with text and illustrations for the articles. Reproductions of this encyclopedia are still in print in China.

While it contains some inaccurate or mythological articles (for example, the articles on the [[horseshoe crab]] and the [[crane (bird)|crane]]), it also distinguished itself from the common “everyday encyclopedias” (''riyong leishu'' 日用類書) at that time by being accurate in some other articles (for example, accurate depictions of the [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Korean people|Korean]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] people’s [[clothing]], and a very accurate [[world map]] (the  [[Shanhai Yudi Quantu]]).

The '''Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum''', often referred to as '''The Guggenheim''', is an art museum located at 1071 [[Fifth Avenue]] on the corner of [[89th Street (Manhattan)|East 89th Street]] in the [[Upper East Side]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], New York City. It is the permanent home of a continuously expanding collection of [[Impressionist]], [[Post-Impressionist]], early [[Modern art|Modern]] and [[contemporary art]] and also features special exhibitions throughout the year. The museum was established by the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]] in 1939 as the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, under the guidance of its first director, the artist [[Hilla von Rebay]]. It adopted its current name after the death of its founder, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim]], in 1952.

In 1959, the museum moved from rented space to its current building, a landmark work of 20th-century architecture. Designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], the cylindrical building, wider at the top than the bottom, was conceived as a "temple of the spirit". Its unique ramp gallery extends up from ground level in a long, continuous spiral along the outer edges of the building to end just under the ceiling skylight. The building underwent extensive expansion and renovations in 1992 (when an adjoining tower was built) and from 2005 to 2008.

The museum's collection has grown organically, over eight decades, and is founded upon several important private collections, beginning with Solomon R. Guggenheim's original collection. The collection is shared with the museum's sister museums in [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|Bilbao]], Spain, and elsewhere. In 2013, nearly 1.2&amp;nbsp;million people visited the museum, and it hosted the most popular exhibition in New York City.&lt;ref name=attendance2013&gt;[http://www.museus.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/TheArtNewspaper2013_ranking.pdf "Top 100 Art Museum Attendance"], ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', 2014, pp. 11 and 15, accessed July 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Early years and Hilla Rebay===
[[Solomon R. Guggenheim]], a member of a wealthy mining family, had been collecting works of the [[old masters]] since the 1890s.

=== Design ===
Rebay conceived of the space as a "temple of the spirit" that would facilitate a new way of looking at the modern pieces in the collection. She wrote to Wright that "each of these great masterpieces should be organized into space, and only you ... would test the possibilities to do so. ... I want a temple of spirit, a monument!"{{sfn|Levine|1996|p=299}}&lt;ref&gt;''The Guggenheim: Frank Lloyd Wright and the Making of the Modern Museum'', pp. 217–18, New York: Guggenheim Museum Publications, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Paul Goldberger]] later wrote that, before Wright's modernist building, "there were only two common models for museum design: [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-arts]] Palace ... and the International Style Pavilion."&lt;ref name=Secret&gt;[http://www.colebrookbossonsaunders.com/The-Secret-Life-of-Buildings-New-York-Public-Library-and-Guggenheim "The Secret Life of Buildings: New York Public Library and Guggenheim Museum"]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Colebrook Bosson Saunders Products Ltd..

[[File:Solomon-R-Guggenheim-Museum-Levels.jpg|right|thumb|287px|The museum's atrium]]
From 1943 to early 1944, Wright produced four different sketches for the initial design. While one of the plans (scheme C) had a hexagonal shape and level floors for the galleries, all the others had circular schemes and used a ramp continuing around the building. He had experimented with the ramp design on the house he completed for his son in 1952, the [[David &amp; Gladys Wright House]] in Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hitchcock |first1=Henry-Russell |title=Arquitectura de los siglos XIX y XX |date=1981 |publisher=Ediciones Cátedra |location=Madrid |isbn=9788437624464 |page=477 |edition=6th |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright's original concept was called an inverted "[[ziggurat]]", because it resembled the steep steps on the ziggurats built in ancient [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name=Storrer401/&gt; His design dispensed with the conventional approach to museum layout, in which visitors are led through a series of interconnected rooms and forced to retrace their steps when exiting.{{sfn|Levine|1996|p=340}} Wright's plan was for the museum guests to ride to the top of the building by elevator, to descend at a leisurely pace along the gentle slope of the continuous ramp, and to view the atrium of the building as the last work of art.

At the same time, before settling on the site for the museum at the corner of 89th Street and [[Fifth Avenue]], overlooking [[Central Park]], Wright, Rebay and Guggenheim considered numerous locations in Manhattan, as well as in the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] section of the Bronx, overlooking the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref name=Ballon&gt;Ballon, pp. 22–27&lt;/ref&gt; Guggenheim felt that the site's proximity to Central Park was important; the park afforded relief from the noise, congestion and concrete of the city.&lt;ref name=Storrer401&gt;Storrer, pp. 400–01&lt;/ref&gt; Nature also provided the museum with inspiration.&lt;ref name=Ballon/&gt; The building embodies Wright's attempts "to render the inherent plasticity of organic forms in architecture."{{sfn|Levine|1996|p=340}} The Guggenheim was to be the only museum designed by Wright.

The spiral design recalled a [[nautilus]] shell, with continuous spaces flowing freely one into another.{{sfn|Levine|1996|p=301}} Even as it embraced nature, Wright's design also expresses his take on modernist architecture's rigid geometry.{{sfn|Levine|1996|p=301}} Wright ascribed a symbolic meaning to the building's shapes.

In 1953, the foundation's collecting criteria expanded under its new director, [[James Johnson Sweeney]]. Sweeney rejected Rebay's dismissal of "objective" painting and sculpture, and he soon acquired [[Constantin Brâncuși]]'s ''Adam and Eve'' (1921), followed by works of other modernist sculptors, including [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Jean Arp]], Calder, [[Alberto Giacometti]] and [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]].&lt;ref name=Calnek/&gt; Sweeney reached beyond the 20th century to acquire [[Paul Cézanne]]'s ''Man with Crossed Arms'' (c. 1899).&lt;ref name=Calnek/&gt; The same year, the foundation also received a gift of 28 important works from the Estate of [[Katherine S. Dreier]], a founder of America's first collection to be called a modern art museum, the [[Société Anonyme]]. Dreier had been a colleague of Rebay's. The works included ''Little French Girl'' (1914–18) by Brâncuși, an untitled still life (1916) by [[Juan Gris]], a bronze sculpture (1919) by [[Alexander Archipenko]] and three collages (1919–21) by German Hanoverian [[Dadaist]] Schwitters. It also included works by Calder, [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[El Lissitzky]] and Mondrian.&lt;ref name=cork/&gt; Among others, Sweeney also acquired the works of [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[David Hayes (sculptor)|David Hayes]], [[Willem de Kooning]] and [[Jackson Pollock]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061001061622/http://www.guggenheim.org/exhibitions/past_exhibitions/global_gugg/global_gugg_bottom_index.html ''The Global Guggenheim''], The Solomon R.

===Messer years===
[[Thomas M. Messer]] succeeded Sweeney as director of the museum (but not the foundation) in 1961 and stayed for 27 years, the longest tenure of any of the city's major arts institutions' directors.&lt;ref name=BioInContext&gt;Kumar, chapter: "Thomas Messer"&lt;/ref&gt; When Messer took over, the museum's ability to present art at all was still in doubt due to the challenges presented by continuous spiral ramp gallery that is both tilted and has non-vertical curved walls.&lt;ref name=Russell1987a&gt;Russell, John.

Retrieved April 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to properly hang paintings in the shallow, windowless exhibition niches that surround the central spiral: canvasses must be mounted raised from the wall's surface. Paintings hung slanted back would appear "as on the artist's easel". There is limited space within the niches for sculpture.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

Almost immediately, in 1962, Messer took a risk putting on a large exhibition that combined the Guggenheim's paintings with [[sculpture]]s on loan from the [[Hirshhorn Museum|Hirshhorn collection]].&lt;ref name=Russell1987a/&gt; Three-dimensional sculpture, in particular, raised "the problem of installing such a show in a museum bearing so close a resemblance to the [[Inferno (Dante)#Overview and vestibule of Hell|circular geography of hell]]", where any vertical object appears tilted in a "drunken lurch" because the slope of the floor and the curvature of the walls could combine to produce vexing optical illusions.&lt;ref name=Canaday1962&gt;Canaday, John.

I half felt that this would be my last exhibition."&lt;ref name=Russell1987a/&gt; Messer had the foresight to prepare by staging a smaller sculpture exhibition the previous year, in which he discovered how to compensate for the space's weird geometry by constructing special [[plinth]]s at a particular angle, so the pieces were not at a true vertical yet appeared to be so.&lt;ref name=Canaday1962/&gt; In the earlier sculpture show, this trick proved impossible for one piece, an [[Alexander Calder]] [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile]] whose wire inevitably hung at a true [[Plumb-bob|plumb]] vertical, "suggesting hallucination" in the disorienting context of the tilted floor.&lt;ref name=Canaday1962/&gt;

This changed in 1992 when the skylight was restored to its original design.&lt;ref name=Sennott572/&gt; By that point, the building had become iconic enough that this augmentation of Wright's original design was itself controversial.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

To finance these moves, controversially, the foundation sold works by Kandinsky, Chagall and [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] to raise $47&amp;nbsp;million, drawing considerable criticism for trading masters for "trendy" latecomers. In ''The New York Times'', critic [[Michael Kimmelman]] wrote that the sales "stretched the accepted rules of [[Deaccessioning#Deaccessioning|deaccessioning]] further than many American institutions have been willing to do."&lt;ref name=Sennott572/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kimmelman1998&gt;{{Citation |last= Kimmelman |first= Michael |title = Art View; The High Cost of Selling Art |date= April 1, 1990 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/01/arts/art-view-the-high-cost-of-selling-art.html |accessdate=April 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Krens defended the action as consistent with the museum's principles, including expanding its international collection and building its "postwar collection to the strength of our pre-war holdings"&lt;ref name=Glueck/&gt; and pointed out that such sales are a regular practice by museums.&lt;ref name=Kimmelman1998/&gt; At the same time, he moved to expand the foundation's international presence by opening museums abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, James S.

===Exterior restoration===
Between September 2005 and July 2008, the Guggenheim Museum underwent a significant exterior restoration to repair cracks and&lt;ref name=Haeyoun&gt;Park, Haeyoun. [https://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2007/04/16/arts/17guggenheim-graphic.html "Face-lift for an Aging Museum"], ''The New York Times'', April 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; modernize systems and exterior details.&lt;ref&gt;Guggenheim Museum web site: [http://www.guggenheim.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3489&amp;Itemid=1476 click link to podcast about restoration (10 MB, audio only, 8 min 45 sec)]&lt;/ref&gt; In the first phase of this project, a team of restoration architects, structural engineers, and architectural conservators worked together to create a comprehensive assessment of the building's condition that determined the structure to be fundamentally sound. This initial condition assessment included:

* the removal of paint from the original surface, revealing hundreds of cracks caused over the years, primarily by seasonal temperature fluctuations;&lt;ref name=Haeyoun/&gt;
* detailed monitoring of the movement of selected cracks over 17 months;
* impact-echo technology, in which sound waves are sent into the concrete and the rebound is measured to locate voids within the walls;
* laser surveys of the exterior and interior surfaces, believed to be the largest laser model ever compiled;
* core drilling to gather samples of the original concrete and other construction materials; and
* testing of potential repair materials.&lt;ref&gt;Pogrebin, Robin. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/arts/design/10gugg.html "The Restorers' Art of the Invisible"], ''The New York Times'', September 10, 2007, pp. E1–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the interior of the building was restored during the 1992 renovation and addition by Gwathmey Siegel and Associates Architects. The 2005–2008 restoration primarily addressed the exterior of the original building and the infrastructure. This included the skylights, windows, doors, concrete and gunite facades and exterior sidewalk, as well as the climate-control. The goal was to preserve as much significant historical fabric of the museum as possible, while accomplishing necessary repairs and attaining a suitable environment for the building's continuing use as a museum.&lt;ref&gt;Guggenheim Museum web site: [http://www.guggenheim.org/restoration.html click link to podcast about restoration (10 MB, audio only, 8 min 45 sec)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011550/http://www.guggenheim.org/restoration.html |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''B-39''''' was a Project 641 ({{sclass2-|Foxtrot|submarine|0}}) diesel-electric attack [[submarine]] of the [[Soviet Navy]]. The "B" (actually "Б") in her designation stands for большая (''bolshaya'', "large") — Foxtrots were the Soviet Navy's largest non-nuclear submarines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/row/rus/641.htm Foxtrot Class - Project 641]&lt;/ref&gt; ''B-39'' is now a [[museum ship]] on display at the [[Maritime Museum of San Diego]], [[California]], United States.

==Service history==
Her [[keel]] was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 9 February 1962 at the [[Admiralty Shipyard]] in Leningrad (now known as [[Saint Petersburg]]). She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 15 April 1967 and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 28 December 1967.

Transferred to the 9th Submarine Squadron of the [[Soviet Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]], ''B-39'' was homeported in [[Vladivostok]]. She conducted patrols and stalked U.S. warships throughout the North Pacific, along the coast of the United States and Canada, and ranging as far as the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Arctic Ocean]]. After the end of the [[Vietnam War]], she often made port visits to [[Danang]]. During the early 1970s, ''B-39'' trailed a Canadian [[frigate]] through [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] to [[Vancouver Island]].

In 1989 in the [[Sea of Japan]] while charging batteries on the surface, ''B-39'' came within {{convert|500|yd|m|0}} of an {{sclass-|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate|2}} of the [[US Navy]]. Both crews took pictures of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sdmaritime.org/visit/the-ships/b-39-submarine/|title=An Actual Soviet-Era Diesel-Electric Submarine.|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-USSR history==
''B-39'' was [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] on 1 April 1994 and sold to [[Finland]]. She made her way from there through a series of sales to [[Vancouver Island]] in 1996 and to [[Seattle, Washington]], in 2002 before arriving in [[San Diego, California]], on 22 April 2005 and becoming an exhibit of the [[Maritime Museum of San Diego]]. During her sequence of owners she acquired the names "Black Widow"{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and "Cobra," neither of which she had during her commissioned career.

When ''B-39'' was made a museum the shroud around her attack [[periscope]] was cut away where it passes through her control room. As built, a Foxtrot's [[periscope]]s are only accessible from her [[conning tower]], which is off-limits in the museum. With the shroud cut away, tourists can look through the partially raised periscope (which is directed toward the {{USS|Midway|CV-41|6}} museum, some {{convert|500|yd|m}} away). However, the unidentified and unexplained change gives the false impression that one periscope could be used from the control room.

At one point ''B-39'' was slated to be sunk to create an offshore diving reef,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delmartimes.net/2010/07/16/soviet-era-submarine-to-be-used-as-dive-reef/ Soviet-era submarine to be used as dive reef - Del Mar Times &amp;#124; Del Mar Times]&lt;/ref&gt; but an outcry from teachers and enthusiasts have ensured the sub will stay put for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/Mar/08/phantom-movie-maritime-museum/2/?#article-copy Sub thriller filmed at Maritime Museum &amp;#124; UTSanDiego.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''B-39'' was used as a stage for the movie [[Phantom (2013 film)|''Phantom'']].

[[Image:Super PI Mod1.5 XS.png|thumb|top|right|300px|Super PI finishing a calculation of 1,048,576, or 2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; digits of pi]]
'''Super PI''' is a [[computer program]] that calculates [[pi]] to a specified number of digits after the decimal point—up to a maximum of 32 million. It uses [[Gauss–Legendre algorithm]] and is a [[Windows]] port of the program used by [[Yasumasa Kanada]] in 1995 to compute pi to 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; digits.

==Significance==
Super PI is popular in the [[overclocking]] community, both as a [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] to test the performance of these systems&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=CPU &amp; GPU Overclocking Guide|first=Sami|last=Maekinen|url=http://digidownload.libero.it/ing.tripodina/Overclocking_Guide_CrossFire_Xpress3200.pdf|year=2006|publisher=ATI Technologies Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Credibility concerns==
The competitive nature of achieving the best Super PI calculation times led to fraudulent Super PI results, reporting calculation times faster than normal. Attempts to counter the fraudulent results resulted in a modified version of Super PI, with a [[checksum]] to validate the results. However, other methods exist of producing inaccurate or fake time results, raising questions about the program's future as an overclocking benchmark.

Super PI utilizes [[x87]] floating point instructions which are supported on all [[x86]] and [[x86-64]] processors, current versions which also support the lower precision [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] vector instructions.

==The future==
Super PI is single [[Thread (computer science)|threaded]], so its relevance as a measure of performance in the current era of [[multi-core]] processors is diminishing quickly. Therefore, [http://virgilioborges.com.br/hyperpi Hyper PI] has been developed to support multiple threads of Super PI to be run at the same time so one can test stability on multi-core machines. Other multithreaded programs include: [[wPrime]], [[IntelBurnTest]], [[Prime95]], [[Montecarlo superPI]], [[OCCT (Benchmark)|OCCT]] or [[y-cruncher]]. Last but not least, while SuperPi is unable to calculate more than 32 million digits, and Alexander J. Yee &amp; Shigeru Kondo were able to set a record of 10 Trillion 50 Digits of Pi using y-cruncher under a 2 x Intel Xeon X5680 @ 3.33&amp;nbsp;GHz - (12 physical cores, 24 hyperthreaded) computer on October 16, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.numberworld.org/misc_runs/pi-10t/details.html |title=Round 2... 10 Trillion Digits of Pi |publisher=numberworld.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Super PI is much slower than these other programs, and utilizes inferior algorithms to them.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''''Taste of Cherry''''' ({{lang-fa|طعم گيلاس...}}, ''Ta’m-e gīlās...'') is a 1997 Iranian [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written, produced and directed by [[Abbas Kiarostami]]. It is a [[minimalism|minimalist]] film about a man who drives through a city suburb, in search of someone who can carry out the task of burying him after he commits suicide. It was awarded the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]].

==Plot summary==
Mr Badii ([[Homayoun Ershadi]]), a middle-aged man, drives through [[Tehran]] looking for someone to do a job for him, and he offers a large amount of money in return. During his drives with prospective candidates, Badii reveals that he plans to kill himself and has already dug the grave. He needs someone to throw earth on his body, after his death. He does not discuss why he wants to commit suicide.

His first recruit is a young, shy [[Kurd]]ish soldier, who refuses to do the job and flees from Badii's car. His second recruit is an [[Afghan people|Afghan]] [[seminarist]], who also declines because he has religious objections to suicide. The third is an [[Azeri]] taxidermist. He is willing to help Badii because he needs the money for his sick child, but tries to talk him out of it; he reveals that he too wanted to commit suicide a long time ago but chose to live when he tasted [[mulberry|mulberries]]. The Azeri promises to throw earth on Badii if he finds him dead in the morning. That night, Badii lies in his grave while a thunderstorm begins. After a long blackout, the film ends by breaking the [[fourth wall]] with [[camcorder]] footage of Kiarostami and the film crew filming ''Taste of Cherry''.

==Cast==
* [[Homayoun Ershadi]] as Mr. Badii 
* Abdolrahman Bagheri as Mr. Bagheri, the taxidermist
* Afshin Khorshid Bakhtiari as Worker
* Safar Ali Moradi as Soldier
* Mir Hossein Noori as Seminarian

==Style==
[[File:Tasteofcherrycolour1.gif|thumb|right|200px|The consistent close up of the character Badii (Homayoun Ershadi) in ''Taste of Cherry'' is later juxtaposed by a panoramic overhead view as his car moves across the hills]]
The film is minimalist in that it is shot primarily with [[long take]]s; the pace is leisurely and there are long periods of silence. Mr. Badii is rarely shown in the same shot as the person he is talking to (this is partly because during the filming, director Kiarostami was sitting in the car's passenger seat).

Kiarostami's style in the film is notable for the use of long shots, such as in the closing sequences. He creates distance for the audience from the characters to stimulate reflection on their fate. ''Taste of Cherry'' is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is conversing with a passenger. The visual distancing stand in contrast to the sound of the dialog, which always remains in the foreground. Like the coexistence of private and public space, or the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, this fusion of distance with proximity can be seen as a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Music==
The film does not include a background score, except for the ending titles. This features a trumpet piece, [[Louis Armstrong]]'s 1929 adaptation of "[[St. James Infirmary Blues]]." The only song featured in the film is "Khuda Bowad Yaret" (May God be your protector) by Afghan singer [[Ahmad Zaher]], which is played in the background on a radio.

==Reception==
''Taste of Cherry'' was awarded the prestigious [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]] in the year of its release,&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4835/year/1997.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Taste of Cherry |accessdate=2009-09-23|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; tied with [[Shohei Imamura]]'s ''[[The Eel (Japanese film)|The Eel]]''.

When the film was released in the United States, however, it met with a split reaction among critics and audiences. [[Roger Ebert]] wrote a scathing review in ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'', giving the film a mere 1 out of 4 stars. Ebert dismissed the film as "excruciatingly boring" and added,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980227/REVIEWS/802270309/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Taste Of Cherry}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"I understand intellectually what Kiarostami is doing. I am not impatiently asking for action or incident. What I do feel, however, is that Kiarostami's style here is an affectation; the subject matter does not make it necessary, and is not benefited by it. If we're to feel sympathy for Badhi, wouldn't it help to know more about him? To know, in fact, anything at all about him? What purpose does it serve to suggest at first he may be a homosexual? (Not what purpose for the audience--what purpose for Badhi himself? Surely he must be aware his intentions are being misinterpreted.) And why must we see Kiarostami's camera crew--a tiresome distancing strategy to remind us we are seeing a movie? If there is one thing ''Taste of Cherry'' does not need, it is such a reminder: The film is such a lifeless drone that we experience it only as a movie."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Ebert later went on to add the film to a list of his most hated movies of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/eberts-most-hated | work=RogerEbert.com | title=Ebert's Most Hated}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In his own review of Kiarostami's film, critic [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of the [[Chicago Reader]] awarded it a full four stars. Responding to Ebert's criticisms, Rosenbaum wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Rosenbaum | first =Jonathan | title =Fill in the Blanks | work =jonathanrosenbaum.net | date =May 29, 1998 | url =http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/?p=6553 | accessdate = April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"A colleague who finds ''Taste of Cherry'' "excruciatingly boring" objects in particular to the fact that we don’t know anything about Badii, to what he sees as the distracting suggestion that Badii might be a homosexual looking for sex, and to what he sees as the tired "distancing strategy" of reminding us at the end that we’re seeing a movie. From the perspective of the history of commercial Western cinema, he has a point on all three counts. But Kiarostami couldn’t care less about conforming to that perspective, and given what he can do, I can’t think of any reason he should care... the most important thing about the joyful finale is that it’s the precise opposite of a "distancing effect." It does invite us into the laboratory from which the film sprang and places us on an equal footing with the filmmaker, yet it does this in a spirit of collective euphoria, suddenly liberating us from the oppressive solitude and darkness of Badii alone in his grave. Shifting to the soldiers reminds us of the happiest part of Badii’s life, and a tree in full bloom reminds us of the Turkish taxidermist’s epiphany — though the soldiers also signify the wars that made both the Kurdish soldier and the Afghan seminarian refugees, and a tree is where the Turk almost hanged himself. Kiarostami is representing life in all its rich complexity, reconfiguring elements from the preceding 80-odd minutes in video to clarify what’s real and what’s concocted. (The "army" is under Kiarostami’s command, but it is Ershadi — an architect friend of the filmmaker in real life — who passes Kiarostami a cigarette.) Far from affirming that ''Taste of Cherry'' is "only" a movie, this wonderful ending is saying, among other things, that it’s also a movie. And we don’t have to remember all of the lyrics of "St. James Infirmary" to know that death is waiting for us around the corner."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[The Criterion Collection]] entered ''Taste of Cherry'' into their exclusive film collection on June 1, 1999. Since the film's release, multiple other critics have also declared it a masterpiece; in the [[British Film Institute]]'s 2012 ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' poll, six critics and two directors named ''Taste of Cherry'' one of the 10 best films ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/film/4ce2b7faa60e1 |title=''Taste of Cherry, The'' (1997) |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=June 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was based on [[Grolier]]'s older ''[[The Children's Encyclopædia|Book of Knowledge]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Encyclopedia, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''New Book of Knowledge'' was originally published by Grolier in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openlibrary.org/b/OL5988842M|title=The Open Library - The New Book of Knowledge [1st ed. &amp;#0093;|accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently published by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Press]], it has gone through several editions. The 2007 edition is published in 21 volumes and contains more than 9,000 articles.&lt;ref name="Official"/&gt; By an agreement with Scholastic, Grolier published the contents of the encyclopedia online with registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infohio.org/Er/Preview2007/grolier2007.html|title=Grolier Online Preview 2007|work=Infohio|accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Scholastic Corporation acquired Grolier and now has full rights to the contents of ''The New Book of Knowledge''.
In 2005 there was an [[Internet petition]] to reinclude an article on [[Persian Empire|Ancient Persia]] in the encyclopedia, which was omitted from the 2005 edition. In response, Scholastic restored the article in the 2006 edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niacouncil.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=305&amp;Itemid=2|work=National Iranian American Council|accessdate=2007-12-11|title=Scholastic Reinstates Persia in "The New Book of Knowledge" |date=November 17, 2005 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071004135905/http://www.niacouncil.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=305&amp;Itemid=2 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2010}}, the Scholastic website has a message stating that the 2006 edition is not available.&lt;ref name="Official"/&gt;

{{Infobox organisation
| name = Le Petit Paumé

The '''Petit Paumé''' is a student association of [[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON Business School]] created in 1968, which name comes from [[Jacques Brel]]'s popular song ''Les Paumés du petit matin'' (1962).

The Petit Paumé's aim is to design and to distribute a critical and free guide of the city of [[Lyon]]. Thus, the association tests all the city restaurants, bars and shops that it wishes to mention in its annual guide.

Each of its members (about 30) is both a tester and a writer. The activities of the association are handled by 16 committees. They print about 300,000 copies of the guidebook per year.

The Petit Paumé publishes a paper version of the guide, a weekly newsletter sent by e-mail, an app for Android and iOS.

== Sections ==
Some examples of chapters in the guide are:

* "Lyon pratique" (Practical Lyon)
* "Cycle de la vie : Naissance, Étudiant, Célibataires, Mariage..." (Life cycle: Birth, Student, Singles, Wedding...)
* "Temps Libre : Activités, Offrir, Coiffeur, Beauté, Voyage..." (Free time: Activities, Gifting, Hairdresser, Beauty, Trips...)
* "Culture : Événements, Livres, Musique, Théâtre, Musée..." (Culture: Events, Books, Music, Theater, Museum...)
* "Péchés Mignons : Pâtisseries, Salons de Thé, Pain Vin Fromage, Épiceries, Traiteur" (Little weakness: Pastries, Tea house, Bread Wine Cheese, Delicatessen, Caterer)
* "Restaurants"
* "Bars"
* "Boîtes" (Nightclubs)
* "Fripon" (Naughty)

== Events ==
Events organised by the Petit Paumé include:

* The "Village Médiéval" (the Medieval Village): in May or June, the Medieval Village brings together more than 20 craft producers on [[Place Saint-Jean (Lyon)|Place Saint-Jean]] during a historical reenactment ambiance around a company of medieval actors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.petitpaume.com/ou-sortir/le-village-medieval-du-petit-paume.htm Official Petit Paumé website&lt;/ref&gt; This two-day event attracts about 65,000 people.
* The "Lancement du Guide" (the Guidebook Launching): in October, the launchings in the Lyon Part-Dieu shopping center and above all on Place Bellecour gather together more than 150,000 inhabitants of Lyon. These launchings are usually accompanied by concerts, street shows, etc. designed to entertain the crowd.&lt;ref name="lyon-info"&gt;[http://www.lyon-info.fr/?Le-Petit-Paume-s-assagit « Le Petit Paumé s’assagit »]. Lyon-info.fr&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "Nuit du Petit Paumé" (the Petit Paumé Night): organized each year at the time of the Guidebook Launching, the Petit Paumé Night is a party which notably enables several thousands of people to get a limited edition of the brand-new guidebook. One of the main issues of the party is to remind people that the guidebook is made by students.

== A few figures ==
{{trivia section|date=February 2018}}

* 300,000 copies of a free guidebook of 416 pages distributed each year in Lyon, with 1,155 reviews altogether and 519 restaurants tested &lt;ref name="lyon-info"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyonmag.com/article/19233/le-petit-paumA-2011-dans-les-starting-blocks- « Le Petit Paumé 2011 dans les starting-blocks ! »] Lyon mag.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* Overall recognition rate of 84% among Lyon inhabitants (according to a survey carried out by [[Ipsos|IPSOS]] in December 2009)

'''Ulil Abshar-Abdalla''' (born  11 January 1967 in Pati, [[Central Java]]) is an Indonesian scholar affiliated to [[Jaringan Islam Liberal]] (Liberal Islam Network). He comes from a family of [[Nahdlatul Ulama]] background: His father Abdullah Rifa'i is from [[pesantren]] Mansajul Ulum (Mansajul Ulum Islamic school) in Pati, Central Java, and he is married to the daughter of [[Mustofa Bisri]], an Islamic cleric from Pesantren Raudlatut Talibin, Rembang, Central Java.

==Background==

Ulil completed his secondary education in Madrasah Mathali'ul Falah, Kajen, Pati, Central Java. This school is led by [[Ahmad Sahal Mahfudz]] which sits in the [[Nahdlatul Ulama]] leadership board during the period of 1994‑1999. Ulil also studied in Pesantren Mansajul 'Ulum, Cebolek, Kajen, Pati, and Pondok Pesantren Al-Anwar, Sarang, Rembang, all in Central Java.

He graduated with bachelor's degree in [[Sharia]] faculty in [[LIPIA]] (Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Islam dan Arab - Islamic and Arabic Knowledge Institute) in [[Jakarta]]. He was also educated in Sekolah Tinggi Filsafat Driyarkara (Driyarkara School of Philosophy). He once held a position as chairman of [[Nahdlatul Ulama]]'s Lakpesdam (Lembaga Kajian dan Pengembangan Sumber Daya Manusia - Human Resources Research and Development Centre), as a researcher in ISAI ([[Institut Studi Arus Informasi]]), Jakarta, and as Program Director in [[Indonesian Conference on Religion and Peace]] (ICRP).

He is also well known for his activism as a coordinator in [[Jaringan Islam Liberal]], a group who claim to deliver a liberal interpretation of [[Islam]]. Due to his activism in this group, he gained praises, sometimes deemed as another reformer after [[Nurcholish Madjid]], as well as controversies.

After completing his master's degree in religion at [[Boston University]] he went on and continued his PhD  studies in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, [[Harvard University]].

==Controversy==

In 2003, a group of Indonesian Islamic clerics from Forum Ulama Umat Islam issued a death [[fatwa]] against Ulil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Atika Shubert, CNN Correspondent |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/southeast/01/22/indo.fatwa/ |title=CNN |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; for an article that Ulil wrote in [[Kompas]] in 2002, "Menyegarkan Kembali Pemahaman Islam" (Rejuvenating the Islamic Understanding) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0211/18/opini/meng04.htm Kompas] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513061236/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0211/18/opini/meng04.htm |date=May 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://islamlib.com/id/index.php?page=article&amp;id=1 |title=Article in JIL website |publisher=Islamlib.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206090935/http://islamlib.com/id/index.php?page=article&amp;id=1 |archivedate=2012-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is considered heretical by the clerics. In March 2011, a letter bomb addressed to Ulil at Komunitas Utan Kayu exploded, injuring a police officer.

Ulil also defended the right of the [[Ahmadi]] people, which is an uncommon stance within conservative Islam. He also opposes many of fatwas by [[Majelis Ulama Indonesia]], such as the one forbidding to give [[Christmas]] greetings to [[Christians]].

The '''Wenyuan Ge''' or '''Wenyuan Library''' ({{zh|s=文渊阁|t=文淵閣|p=Wényuān Gé|c=|l=Hall of Literary Profundity|w=Wen-yuan Ko}}) is a palace building in the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Official Titles in Imperial China|last=Hucker|first=Charles|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1985|isbn=9780804711937|location=|pages=568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hall was an imperial library, and a place for learned discussion, thus some [[Grand Secretariat|Grand Secertaries]] were assigned to there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=中国历代职官辞典|last=Qiu|first=Shusen|publisher=Jiangxi Education Publishing House|year=1991|isbn=9787539203966|location=|pages=141|language=zh|trans-title=A Dictionary of Chinese Historical Official Titles}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sited to the east of the Fengtian Gate in Nanjing, during the [[Hongwu]] era. After the [[Yongle Emperor]] made Beijing China's capital, its name continued to be used for the lobby in the east of the Cabinet Hall of the Forbidden City, which was burnt down in the late Ming.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;

The existing hall which is patterned on the [[Tianyi Ge]] in Ningbo was rebuilt behind the Wenhua Palace, in the reign of the [[Qianlong Emperor]]. Completed in 1776, it was a kind of library and stored numerous works, including a copy of the ''[[Siku Quanshu]]''. The [[Wenjin Ge]] in the [[Chengde Mountain Resort]] is its counterpart.&lt;ref name=":022"&gt;{{Cite book|title=中国大百科全书（第二版）|last=|first=|publisher=Encyclopedia of China Publishing House|year=2009|isbn=978-7-500-07958-3|volume=23|location=|pages=342–3|language=zh|trans-title=Encyclopedia of China (2nd Edition)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
