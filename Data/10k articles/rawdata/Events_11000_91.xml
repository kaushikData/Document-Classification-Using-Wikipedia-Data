The '''1957 [[Bandy World Championship]]''' was contested among three men's [[bandy]] playing nations and was the first ever Bandy World Championship. Norway declined to take part due to the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet invasion of Hungary]] the year before.

The championship was played in [[Finland]] from 28 February to 3 March 1957, as part of the fifty year anniversary celebrations for the [[Football Association of Finland|Ball Association of Finland]], which at the time was the governing body for bandy in Finland. The tournament was officially opened by [[President of Finland|President of the republic]] [[Urho Kekkonen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cit book|author=[[Arne Argus]]|title=Mästarglans kring bandy-VM|language=Swedish||page=2|publisher=Svenska bandyförbundet ([[Swedish Bandy Association]])|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; All games, which were only three, were played at the [[Helsinki Olympic Stadium]].

On 1 May 1960, a United States [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] [[reconnaissance aircraft|spy plane]] was shot down by the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces]] while performing photographic [[aerial reconnaissance]] deep into [[Soviet]] territory. The single-seat aircraft, flown by pilot [[Francis Gary Powers]], was hit by an [[S-75 Dvina]] (SA-2 Guideline) [[surface-to-air missile]] and crashed near [[Sverdlovsk, Russia|Sverdlovsk]] (today's Yekaterinburg). Powers parachuted safely and was captured.

Initially, the US authorities acknowledged the incident as the loss of a civilian weather research aircraft operated by [[NASA]], but were forced to admit the mission's true purpose when a few days later the Soviet government produced the captured pilot and parts of the U-2's [[surveillance]] equipment, including photographs of Soviet military bases taken during the mission.

The incident occurred during the presidency of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and the premiership of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], around two weeks before the scheduled opening of an east–west summit in Paris. It caused great embarrassment to the United States and prompted a marked deterioration in its [[Soviet Union–United States relations#Cold War (1945–91)|relations with the Soviet Union]], already strained by the ongoing [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="us news"&gt;{{cite news|title=Presidential Lies and Deceptions |last=Walsh |first=Kenneth T. |date=6 June 2008 |publisher=US News and World Report |url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/politics/2008/06/06/presidential-lies-and-deceptions.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929194001/http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/politics/2008/06/06/presidential-lies-and-deceptions.html |archivedate=29 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powers was convicted of [[espionage]] and sentenced to three years of [[imprisonment]] plus seven years of [[hard labor]] but was released two years later on 10 February 1962 during a [[prisoner exchange]] for Soviet officer [[Rudolf Abel]].&lt;ref name="Russian officer"/&gt;

==Background==
In July 1958, U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] requested permission from [[Pakistan]]i Prime Minister [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy|Huseyn Suhrawardy]] for the U.S. to establish a secret intelligence facility in Pakistan and for the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spyplane to fly from Pakistan. The U-2 flew at altitudes that could not be reached by Soviet fighter jets of the era; it was believed to be beyond the reach of Soviet missiles as well. A facility established in [[Badaber]] ([[Peshawar Air Station]]), {{convert|10|mi|km}} from [[Peshawar]], was a cover for a major communications intercept operation run by the United States [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). Badaber was an excellent location because of its proximity to Soviet central Asia. This enabled the monitoring of missile test sites, key infrastructure and communications. The U-2 "spy-in-the-sky" was allowed to use the [[PAF Base Peshawar|Pakistan Air Force section]] of [[Peshawar International Airport|Peshawar Airport]] to gain vital photo intelligence in an era before satellite observation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amjad Ali (civil servant)|Amjad Ali]], the Pakistani ambassador to the US at the time, narrated in his book ''Glimpses'' (Lahore: Jang Publishers, 1992) that the personal assistant of Suhrawardy advised embassy staff of the Prime Minister's agreement to the US facility on Pakistan soil.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Eisenhower did not want to fly American U-2 pilots over the Soviet Union because he felt that if one of these pilots were to be shot down or captured that it could be seen as an act of aggression. At a time like the [[Cold War]], any act of aggression could spark open conflict between the two countries. In order to ease the burden of flying Americans into Soviet airspace the idea developed to have British pilots from the [[Royal Air Force]] fly these missions in place of the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). With the [[United Kingdom]] still reeling from the aftermath of the [[Suez Crisis]] and in no position to snub American requests, the British government was amenable to the proposal. Using British pilots allowed Eisenhower to be able to use the U-2 plane to see what the Soviet Union was hiding, while still being able to plausibly deny any affiliation if a mission became compromised.

After the success of the first two British pilots and because of pressure to determine the number of Soviet [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]] more accurately, Eisenhower allowed the flying of two more missions before the Four Power Paris Summit, scheduled for 16 May. The final two missions before the summit were to be flown by American pilots.&lt;ref&gt;Brugioni, Dino A., and Doris G. Taylor. ''Eyes in the Sky: Eisenhower, the CIA, and Cold War Aerial Espionage'' (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute, 2010), pp. 343–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 April 1960, a U-2C spyplane of the special CIA unit "10-10," piloted by Bob Ericson, crossed the southern national boundary of the Soviet Union in the area of [[Pamir Mountains]] and flew over four Soviet top secret military objects: the [[Semipalatinsk Test Site]], the [[Dolon (air base)|Dolon Air Base]] where [[Tupolev Tu-95|Tu-95]] strategic bombers were stationed, the [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) test site of the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces]] near [[Saryshagan]], and the [[Tyuratam]] missile range ([[Baikonur Cosmodrome]]).&lt;ref name=PocockU2&gt;{{cite book |title=The U-2 Spyplane: Toward the Unknown – A New History of the Early Years |last=Pocock |first=Chris |year=2000 |publisher=[[Schiffer Military History]] | location = Atglen, PA |isbn=978-0-7643-1113-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plane was detected by the Soviet Air Defense Forces when it had flown more than {{convert|250|km|mi|round=5}} over the Soviet national boundary and avoided several attempts at interception by a [[MiG-19]] and a [[Su-9]] during the flight. The U-2 left Soviet air space and landed at an Iranian airstrip at [[Zahedan]]. It was clear that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency had successfully performed an extraordinary intelligence operation. The next flight of the U-2 spyplane from Peshawar airport was planned for late April.&lt;ref name="PocockU2" /&gt;

== Event ==
[[File:OperationGrandSlam1960.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|U-2 "GRAND SLAM" flight plan on 1 May 1960, from CIA publication ''The Central Intelligence Agency and Overhead Reconnaissance; The U-2 And Oxcart Programs, 1954–1974'', declassified 25 June 2013]]

On 28 April 1960, a U.S. [[Lockheed U-2]]C spy plane, Article 358, was ferried from [[Incirlik Air Base]] in Turkey to the US base at Peshawar airport by pilot Glen Dunaway. Fuel for the aircraft had been ferried to [[Peshawar]] the previous day in a US Air Force [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II|C-124]] transport. A [[US Air Force]] [[C-130]] followed, carrying the ground crew, mission pilot [[Francis Gary Powers|Francis Powers]], and the back up pilot, Bob Ericson. On the morning of 29 April, the crew in Badaber was informed that the mission had been delayed one day. As a result, Bob Ericson flew Article 358 back to Incirlik and John Shinn ferried another U-2C, Article 360, from Incirlik to Peshawar. On 30 April, the mission was delayed one day further because of bad weather over the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="PocockU2"/&gt;

The weather improved and on 1 May, 15 days before the scheduled opening of the east–west summit conference in Paris, Captain Powers, flying Article 360, ''56–6693'' left the base in Peshawar on a mission with the operations code word ''GRAND SLAM''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRO review and redaction guide (2006 ed.)| url=https://fas.org/irp/nro/declass.pdf |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; to overfly the Soviet Union, photographing targets including the [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] sites at the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] and [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]], then land at [[Bodø]] in Norway. At the time, the USSR had six ICBM launch pads, two at Baikonur and four at Plesetsk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harford|first=James|year=1997|title=Korolev: How One Man Masterminded the Soviet Drive to Beat America to the Moon|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-14853-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mayak]], then named [[Chelyabinsk-65]], an important industrial center of plutonium processing, was another of the targets that Powers was to photograph.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite journal | publisher=Central Intelligence Agency | author = Oleg A.

[[File:Francis Gary Powers U2 at Moscow.jpg|thumb|left|Part of the U-2 wreckage on display at [[Central Armed Forces Museum]] in Moscow]]

The U-2 flight was expected, and all units of the Soviet Air Defence Forces in the Central Asia, Kazakhstan, [[Siberia]], [[Ural (region)|Ural]], and later in the USSR European Region and [[Extreme North (Russia)|Extreme North]], were placed on red alert. Soon after the plane was detected, Lieutenant General of the Air Force [[Yevgeniy Savitskiy]] ordered the air-unit commanders "to attack the violator by all alert flights located in the area of foreign plane's course, and to [[Aerial ramming#Cold War|ram]] if necessary".&lt;ref name=howPowers&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.webslivki.com/u11.html | title = Как сбили Пауэрса | trans-title = How Powers was shot down | language = Russian | author = Банцер, Сергей (Sergey Bantser) | access-date = 4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the U-2's extreme operating altitude, Soviet attempts to intercept the plane using fighter aircraft failed. The U-2's course was out of range of several of the nearest SAM sites, and one SAM site even failed to engage the aircraft since it was not on duty that day. The U-2 was eventually brought down near Kosulino, Ural Region, by the first of three [[S-75 Dvina|SA-2 Guideline (S-75 Dvina)]] surface-to-air missiles&lt;ref&gt;"Таким образом, всего по Lockheed U-2 и двум МиГ было выпущено семь ракет.

Powers bailed out but neglected to disconnect his oxygen hose first and struggled with it until it broke, enabling him to separate from the aircraft. Powers was captured soon after parachuting safely down onto Russian soil.&lt;ref name=howPowers/&gt; Powers carried with him a modified [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar]] which contained a lethal, shellfish-derived [[saxitoxin]]-tipped needle, but he did not use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vectorsite.net/twgas_4.html |title=A History Of Biological Warfare (2) |last=Goebel |first=Greg |publisher=Vectorsite.net |date=1 July 2010 |accessdate=31 December 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811125538/http://www.vectorsite.net/twgas_4.html |archivedate=11 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SAM command center was unaware that the plane was destroyed for more than 30 minutes.&lt;ref name=howPowers/&gt; One of the Soviet MiG-19 fighters pursuing Powers was also destroyed in the missile salvo, and the pilot, [[Sergei Safronov (fighter pilot)|Sergei Safronov]], was killed.&lt;ref name="PocockU2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burrows |first=William E. |title=Deep Black: Space Espionage and National Security |year=1986 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0-394-54124-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MiGs' [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] transponders were not yet switched to the new May codes because of the [[May Day|1 May holiday]].&lt;ref name="SKhrushchev"&gt;Khrushchev, Sergei (September 2000) [http://www.americanheritage.com/content/day-we-shot-down-u-2 "The Day We Shot Down the U-2: Nikita Khrushchev's son remembers a great turning point of the Cold War, as seen from behind the Iron Curtain".] ''American Heritage'' magazine.

Four days after Powers' disappearance, [[NASA]] issued a very detailed press release noting that an aircraft had "gone missing" north of [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Russian officer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Orlov |first=Alexander |url=https://www.cia.gov/csi/studies/winter98_99/art02.html |title=The U-2 Program: A Russian Officer Remembers |accessdate=8 January 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713154414/http://www.cia.gov/csi/studies/winter98_99/art02.html |archivedate=13 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The press release speculated that the pilot might have fallen unconscious while the [[autopilot]] was still engaged, even falsely claiming that "the pilot reported over the emergency frequency that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties." To bolster this, a U-2 plane was quickly painted in NASA colors and shown to the media. Under the impression that the pilot had died and that the plane had been destroyed, the Americans had decided to use the NASA [[cover-up]] plan.&lt;ref&gt;Brugioni and Taylor (2010), p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikita Khrushchev]] used the American misstep to embarrass President Eisenhower and his administration.

That same day on 5 May, the Senate made its first comments on the U-2 incident, and began a domestic political controversy for Eisenhower. [[Mike Mansfield]], the [[Senate Majority Whip]], stated, "First reports indicate that the President had no knowledge of the plane incident. If that is the case, we have got to ask whether or not this administration has any real control over the federal bureaucracy."&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record, 5-5-60, pp. 9493–94; quoted in Barrett (2005), p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; Mansfield, more than any other person, highlighted the dilemma Eisenhower faced—Eisenhower could admit responsibility for the U-2 flight, and likely ruin any chances for détente at the Paris Summit, or he could continue to deny knowledge and indicate that he did not control his own administration.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Barrett, ''CIA and Congress: The Untold Story from Truman to Kennedy'' (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2005), p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Khrushchev found out about America's NASA cover story, he developed a political trap for Eisenhower. His plan began with the release of information to the world that a spy plane had been shot down in Soviet territory, but he did not reveal that the pilot of this plane had also been found and that he was alive. With the information that Khrushchev released, the Americans believed that they would be able to continue with their cover story that the crashed plane was a weather research aircraft and not a military spy plane. The cover-up said that the pilot of the U-2 weather plane had radioed in that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties while flying over Turkey. From there they claimed that the plane could have continued on its path because of auto-pilot, and that this could be the plane that crashed in the Soviet Union. The final attempt to make the cover story seem as real as possible was the grounding of all U-2 planes for mandatory inspection of oxygen systems in order to make sure that no other "weather missions" would have the same result as the one that was lost and possibly crashed in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="BrugioniDino"&gt;Brugioni and Taylor (2010), pp. 346–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 May, Khrushchev sprang his trap and announced:&lt;ref name=Powers&amp;Gentry1970/&gt; {{quote|I must tell you a secret. When I made my first report I deliberately did not say that the pilot was alive and well&amp;nbsp;... and now just look how many silly things the Americans have said.}}

Also, because of the release of some photographs of the plane, there was evidence that most of the covert U-2 technologies had survived the crash. From this Khrushchev was able to openly embarrass the Eisenhower administration by exposing the attempted cover-up.&lt;ref name="Tucker-1319-1320"&gt;[[Tucker, Spencer C.]] ''The Encyclopedia of the Cold War: A Political, Social, and Military History''.

Khrushchev still attempted to allow Eisenhower to save face, possibly to salvage the peace summit to some degree, by specifically laying the blame not on Eisenhower himself, but on [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[Allen Dulles]] and the [[CIA]]: Khrushchev said that anyone wishing to understand the U-2's mission should "seek a reply from Allen Dulles, at whose instructions the American aircraft flew over the Soviet Union."&lt;ref&gt;Beschloss (1986), pp. 234, 242-52; quoted in Barrett (2005), p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 May, the Soviet premier told US ambassador Thompson that he "could not help but suspect that someone had launched this operation with the deliberate intent of spoiling the summit meeting." Thompson also wrote in his diplomatic cable that Khrushchev suspected it was Allen Dulles, and that Khrushchev had heard about Senator Mansfield's remarks that Eisenhower did not control his own administration.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson to State Department, 5-9-60, FRUS: Eastern Europe, 1955–1957, Soviet Union, vol 10, pp. 519–21; quoted in Barrett (2005), p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon receiving this cable, Eisenhower, who frequently was very animated, was quiet and depressed. The only words he said to his secretary were, "I would like to resign."&lt;ref&gt;Whitman Diary, Whitman File, DDE diary, 5-9-60. Box 5, DDE Library; quoted in Barrett (2005), p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the domestic pressure continued to mount. Eisenhower then accepted Dulles's argument that the congressional leadership needed to be briefed on the U-2 missions from the last four years. Dulles told the legislature that all U-2 flights were used for aerial espionage and had been flown pursuant to "presidential directives". Still, Dulles played down Eisenhower's direct role in approving every previous U-2 flight.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record, 5-9-60, pp. 9979–87, A3941. "Briefing of Congressional Leadership&amp;nbsp;... 9 May 1960," Dulles FOIA Papers; quoted in Barrett (2005), p. 388–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day on 10 May, without consulting with any agency heads, [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations]] Chair [[Clarence Cannon]] received considerable press attention when he, not President Eisenhower, revealed the true nature of the U-2 mission. He said to an open session of the [[House of Representatives of the United States|House of Representatives]] that the U-2 was a CIA plane engaged in aerial espionage over the Soviet Union. Cannon said,

{{quote|Mr. Chairman, on May 1 the Soviet Government captured, 1300 miles inside the boundaries of the Russian empire, an American plane, operated by an American pilot, under the direction and control of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, and is now holding both the plane and the pilot. The plane was on an espionage mission&amp;nbsp;... The activity&amp;nbsp;... [was] under the aegis of the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, for whom all members of the subcommittee have the highest regard and in whose military capacity they have the utmost confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record, 5-10-60, pp. 9854–55; quoted in Barrett (2005), p. 395–97.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
At the end of Cannon's speech, Democrats and Republicans uncharacteristically rose to their feet to applaud.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett (2005), p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still Eisenhower faced criticism in the press for not controlling his own administration, as Cannon's speech only said the mission was "under the aegis of" the president, not "directed by". Press reports were creating a belief in the public that Eisenhower had lost control, which Eisenhower would not let stand. Knowing that he was jeopardizing the Paris Peace Summit, Eisenhower decided to reveal the aerial espionage program and his direct role in it, an unprecedented move for a U.S. president. His speech on 11 May revolved around four main points: the need for intelligence gathering activities; the nature of intelligence gathering activities; how intelligence activities should be viewed (as distasteful, but vital); and finally that Americans should not be distracted from the real problems of the day. Eisenhower closed passionately by reacting to the Soviet claim that the US acted provocatively and said: "They had better look at their own [espionage] record." As he finished, he told reporters he was still going to the Paris Peace Summit.&lt;ref&gt;''Public Papers of the Presidents, 1960'', pp. 403–09, 414-15; quoted in Barrett (2005), pp. 398–400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today a large part of the wreck as well as many items from Powers's [[survival pack]] are on display at the [[Central Armed Forces Museum]] in Moscow. A small piece of the plane was returned to the United States and is on display at the [[National Cryptologic Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U-2 Incident Exhibit |work=National Cryptologic Museum |publisher=National Security Agency - Central Security Service |url=http://www.nsa.gov/museum/museu00034.cfm |accessdate=10 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622112428/http://www.nsa.gov/museum/museu00034.cfm |archivedate=22 June 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intelligence ==

Already from 1948, Norwegian [[Selmer Nilsen]] had been recruited by the Soviet intelligence organization GRU, amongst other foreigners, to spy on allied activity in NATO countries. Nilsen was assigned to watch allied military activity in northern Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Fjørtoft, Kjell, "Spionfamilien", Gyldendal norsk forlag, 1986, Oslo&lt;/ref&gt; The U-2 operations were linked with the airport Bodø, which was one of its permanent stations. Selmer Nilsen recorded U-2 activity in Bodø and forwarded much military information to the Soviet Union. He was convicted for espionage in 1968 in a closed trial in Norway, with a penalty of seven years and six months' imprisonment. He was released after three years.

===Contemporary reactions to the U-2 incident and effect on the Four Powers Summit===
The Summit was attended by Eisenhower, Khrushchev, French President [[Charles de Gaulle]], and British Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]].&lt;ref name="BBC 'On this Day' May 17th"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/17/newsid_2512000/2512335.stm |title=1960: East-West summit in tatters after spy plane row |accessdate=22 May 2013 |work=BBC News |date=17 May 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first conference to be attended by both Soviet and western leaders in five years.&lt;ref name="Walter Cronkite: History Lessons"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4653988 |title=Loss of Spy Plane Sabotaged 1960 Summit |accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, prospects for constructive dialogue were dashed by the explosive controversy surrounding the U-2 flight over Soviet territory.

Although the Four Powers Summit was the first meeting between western and Soviet leaders in five years when it was held, the mood was optimistic that there could be an easing of tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States. In an effort to present a less hostile, more cordial Soviet Union, Khrushchev publicly advocated a policy of "peaceful coexistence with the United States."&lt;ref name="Walter Cronkite: History Lessons"/&gt; The May Day celebrations on 1 May of that year were marked by this newfound cooperative spirit. Absent were the militarized symbols of previous parades, such as artillery and armor. Instead there were children, white doves, and athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://archive.org/details/1960-05-05_russia |title=Russia, 1960/05/05 | date = 5 May 1960 | medium = newsreel | publisher = Universal-International News |accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the reaction of the Soviet government to the spy plane incident and the response from the United States doomed any potential meaningful peace agreement.&lt;ref name="BBC 'On this Day' May 17th"/&gt;

In the days directly leading up to the conference, tensions increased dramatically between the United States and the Soviet Union over the U-2 incident. At this point in the negotiations, the hardliners of the Soviet government were applying heavy pressure to Khrushchev. In the weeks leading up to the summit there had been a revitalization of anti-American sentiment within the Kremlin, with the Soviets blocking a planned trip to Washington D.C. of a Soviet air marshal, inviting Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong to Moscow, and launching an anti-American press campaign designed to critique "American aggression".&lt;ref name="Beschloss1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beschloss|first=Michael|title=Mayday: Eisenhower, Khrushchev, and the U-2 Affair|year=1986|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-015565-0|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time east and west were divided about how to move forward in Berlin, and the American press characterized Khrushchev's decision to emphasize the U-2 incident at the summit as an attempt to gain leverage on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://archive.org/details/1960-05-16_summit_crisis |title=Summit Crisis. Mr. K. In Ugly Mood Over U-2 Incident, 1960/05/16 (1960) | medium = newsreel | date = 16 May 1960 | publisher = Universal-International News |accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The summit itself did not last long, with talks only beginning on 15 May and ending on 16 May. Both Eisenhower and Khrushchev gave statements on the 16th. Khrushchev blasted the United States on the U-2 incident. He pointed out that the policy of secret spying was one of mistrust and that the incident had doomed the summit before it even began. He expected the United States and Eisenhower to condemn the spying and pledge to end further reconnaissance missions.&lt;ref name="Modern History Sourcebook"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1960summit-statements1.asp |title=Modern History Sourcebook: Khrushchev and Eisenhower: Summit Statements, May 16, 1960 |accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the summit, after Khrushchev had blown Eisenhower's cover, Eisenhower did not deny that the plane had been spying on Soviet military installations but contended that the action was not aggressive but defensive. He argued that the current state of international relations was not one in which peaceful coexistence was an already established fact. The policy of the United States towards the Soviet Union at that time was defensive and cautionary. Eisenhower also made the point that dialogue at the Four Powers Summit was the type of international negotiation that could lead to a relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union where there would be no need to spy on each other. Eisenhower also laid out a plan for an international agreement that authorized the U.N. to "inspect" any nations willing to submit to its authority for signs of increased militarization and aggressive action. He stated that the United States would be more than willing to submit to such an inspection by the U.N. and that he hoped to circumvent the spying controversy with this alternative international surveillance agreement.&lt;ref name="Modern History Sourcebook"/&gt;

The meeting during which both parties made their statements lasted just over three hours. During this time Khrushchev rescinded an invitation he had earlier given to Eisenhower to visit the Soviet Union.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

According to Walter Cronkite, Khrushchev would go on to say that this incident was the beginning of his decline in power as party chairman, perhaps because he seemed unable to negotiate the international arena and the communist hardliners at home.&lt;ref name="Walter Cronkite: History Lessons"/&gt; The collapse of the summit also saw an increased tension between the Soviets and the Americans in the years to come. After this debacle the arms race accelerated and any considerations for negotiations were dashed for the immediate future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Geelhoed |first=Bruce E. |title=Eisenhower, Macmillan, and Allied Unity, 1957–1961 |year=2003 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=978-0-333-64227-6 |page=101 |author2=Anthony O. Edmonds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences of the failed summit===
As a result of the spy plane incident and the attempted cover-up, the Four Power Paris Summit was not completed. At the beginning of the talks on 16 May, there was still hope that the two sides could come together even after the events that took place earlier in May, but Eisenhower refused to apologize and Khrushchev left the summit one day after it had begun. Some people{{Who|date=June 2015}} said that Khrushchev had overreacted to the event in an attempt to strengthen his own position, and for that, he was the one to blame for the collapse of the Four Power Paris Summit.&lt;ref name=Tucker-1319-1320/&gt;

Before the U-2 incident Khrushchev and Eisenhower had been getting along well and the summit was going to be an opportunity for the two sides to come together. Also, Eisenhower had been looking forward to a visit to the Soviet Union and was very upset when his invitation was retracted. The two sides were going to discuss topics such as nuclear arms reduction and also how to deal with increasing tensions surrounding Berlin. According to Eisenhower, had it not been for the U-2 incident the summit and his visit to the Soviet Union could have greatly helped Soviet and American relations.&lt;ref name=Tucker-1320&gt;Tucker (2008), p. 1320.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union convened a meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council]] on 23 May to tell their side of the story.&lt;ref name="UN_SPV857"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-PV-857 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=857 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=23 May 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meetings continued for four days with other allegations of spying being exchanged, as well as recriminations over the Paris Summit, and a US offer of an "open skies" proposal to allow reciprocal flights over one another's territory,&lt;ref name="UN_SPV858"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-PV-858 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=858 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=24 May 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_SPV859"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-PV-859 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=859 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=25 May 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_SPV860"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-PV-860 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=860 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=26 May 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of which the Soviet Union overwhelmingly lost a vote&lt;ref name="UN_SPV860_page17"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-PV-860 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=860 |highlight=rect_142,1005_509,1200 |page=17 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=26 May 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a concise resolution which would have condemned the incursions and requested the US to prevent their recurrence.&lt;ref name="UN_S4321"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-4321 |type=Document |body=Security Council |year=-1 |document_number=4321 |accessdate=29 August 2008|date=23 May 1960|title=Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: draft resolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident severely compromised Pakistan's security and worsened [[Pakistan–United States relations|relations with the United States]]. As an attempt to put up a bold front,{{what|date=May 2018}} General [[Khalid Mahmud Arif]] of the [[Pakistan Army]], while commenting on the incident, stated that "Pakistan felt deceived because the US had kept her in the dark about such clandestine spy operations launched from Pakistan's territory."&lt;ref&gt;Hamid Hussain.

(2001), ''The Cold War'', Routledge, p. 104. 978-0815337218.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pilot fate===
Upon his capture, [[Francis Gary Powers|Gary Powers]] told his Soviet captors what his mission had been and why he had been in Soviet airspace. He did this in accordance with orders that he had received before he went on his mission.&lt;ref name=Tucker-1320/&gt; Powers pleaded guilty and was convicted of espionage on 19 August and sentenced to three years imprisonment and seven years of [[hard labor]]. He served one year and nine months of the sentence before being [[prisoner exchange|exchanged]] for [[Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher|Rudolf Abel]] on 10 February 1962.&lt;ref name="Russian officer"/&gt; The exchange occurred on the [[Glienicke Bridge]] connecting [[Potsdam]], [[East Germany]], to [[West Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Three days in 300 years: Spies on the bridge | url = http://www.glienicke-bridge.com/pageID_1283824.html |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New tactics and technology===
The incident showed that even high-altitude aircraft were vulnerable to Soviet surface-to-air missiles. As a result, the United States began emphasizing high-speed, low-level flights for its previously high altitude [[B-47]], [[B-52]] and [[B-58]] bombers,  and began developing the supersonic [[F-111]], which would include an [[F-111|FB-111A]] variant for the [[Strategic Air Command]].&lt;ref name="lax2010"&gt;{{cite book | title=From Controversy to Cutting Edge: A History of the F-111 in Australian Service | url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Publications/Details/431/From-Controversy-to-Cutting-Edge.aspx | page=15 | publisher=Air Power Development Centre, [[Department of Defence (Australia)]] | author=Lax, Mark | location=Canberra, Australia | isbn=978-1-920800-54-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Corona (satellite)|Corona]] spy satellite project was accelerated. The CIA also accelerated the development of the [[Lockheed A-12]] OXCART supersonic spyplane that first flew in 1962 and later began developing the [[Lockheed D-21]] [[unmanned drone]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Later versions==
The original consensus about the cause of the U-2 incident was that the spy plane had been shot down by one of a salvo of 14 Soviet SA-2 missiles. This story was originated by [[Oleg Penkovsky]], a [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] agent who spied for [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Penkovsky Papers: The Russian Who Spied for the West |last=Penkovsky |first=Oleg |year=1966 |publisher=Collins | location = London | oclc = 2714427}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, CIA documents were released indicating that "top US officials never believed Powers's account of his fateful flight because it appeared to be directly contradicted by a report from the National Security Agency" which alleged that the U-2 had descended from 65,000 to 34,000 feet (19,812 to 10,363&amp;nbsp;m) before changing course and disappearing from radar. One contemporary reading of the NSA's story is that they mistakenly tracked the descent of a [[MiG-19]] piloted by Sr. Lt. Sergei Safronov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article7113512.ece | title = CIA documents show US never believed Gary Powers was shot down | work = [[The Times]] | publisher = Times Newspapers Limited | registration = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Igor Mentyukov===
In 1996, Soviet pilot Captain Igor Mentyukov claimed that, at {{convert|65,000|ft|m|-2}} altitude, under orders to ram the intruder, he had caught the U-2 in the [[slipstream]] of his unarmed [[Sukhoi Su-9]], causing the U-2 to flip over and break its wings. The salvo of missiles had indeed scored a hit, downing a pursuing [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19|MiG-19]], not the U-2. Mentyukov said that if a missile had hit the U-2, its pilot would not have lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Atomic Audit: The Costs and Consequences of U.S. Nuclear Weapons Since 1940|last=Schwartz |first=Stephen I. |year=1998 |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |isbn=0-8157-7774-4 |page=679}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=1997Schwatz&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schwartz |first=Stephen I. |url=http://205.188.238.181/time/magazine/article/0,9171,987578-3,00.html |work=Time |title=Letter to the editor: Stephen I. Schwartz, Director U.S. Nuclear Weapons Cost Study Project, Brookings Institution, Washington |date=22 December 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017212434/http://205.188.238.181/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C987578-3%2C00.html |archivedate=17 October 2009 |accessdate=20 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the normal Su-9 service ceiling was {{convert|55,000|ft|m|-2}}, Mentyukov's aircraft had been modified to achieve higher altitudes, having its weapons removed. With no weapons, the only attack option open to him was [[aerial ramming]]. Mentyukov asserted that Soviet generals concealed these facts to avoid challenging Nikita Khrushchev's faith in the efficiency of Soviet air defenses.&lt;ref name=1997Schwatz/&gt;

===Sergei Khrushchev===
In 2000, [[Sergei Khrushchev]] wrote about the experience of his father, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], in the incident. He described how Mentyukov attempted to intercept the U-2, but failed to gain visual contact. Major Mikhail Voronov, in control of a battery of anti-aircraft missiles, fired three SA-2s at the radar contact but only one ignited. It quickly rose toward the target and exploded in the air behind the U-2 but near enough to violently shake the aircraft, tearing off its long wings. At a lower altitude, Powers climbed out of the falling fuselage and parachuted to the ground. Uncertainty about the initial shootdown success resulted in 13 further anti-aircraft missiles being fired by neighboring batteries, but the later missiles only hit a pursuing MiG-19 piloted by Sr. Lt. Sergei Safronov, mortally wounding him.&lt;ref name=SKhrushchev/&gt; This account of the events that occurred during the mission match the details that were given to the CIA by Gary Powers. According to Powers, a missile exploded behind him and after this occurred his U-2 began to nosedive. It is at this point that Powers began to make all of the preparations to eject. Powers landed safely and tried to hide in the Russian countryside until he could get help. His attempts to do this failed and he was captured.&lt;ref name="BrugioniDino" /&gt; Sergei Safronov was [[posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]].&lt;ref name=howPowers/&gt;

==Film==
In 2015 the [[Steven Spielberg]] feature film ''[[Bridge of Spies (film)|Bridge of Spies]]'' was released, which dramatized [[James B. Donovan]] ([[Tom Hanks]] &lt;ref&gt;McNary, Dave (20 May 2014 ).

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''&lt;/ref&gt;)'s negotiations for Powers' release, but took certain liberties with what really happened. For instance, Powers is shown being tortured by the Soviets, when in reality he was treated well by his captors and spent much of his time doing [[handicrafts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.nasm.si.edu/aviation/busting-u2-myths/ | title = Bridge of Spies: An Opportunity to Bust Myths about the U-2 and the Capture of Gary Powers | first = Layne | last = Karafantis | date = 27 October 2015 | work = AirSpaceBlog: Behind The Scenes at the National Air and Space Museum | publisher = The National Air and Space Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of the Soviet Union}}
The '''1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt''', also known as the '''August Coup''' ({{lang-rus|Августовский путч|r=Avgustovskiy Putch}} "'''August Putsch'''"), was an attempt by members of the [[Government of the Soviet Union|government]] of the [[USSR]] to take control of the country from [[President of the Soviet Union|Soviet President]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. The [[Coup d'état|coup]] leaders were [[hard-line]] members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) who were opposed to Gorbachev's reform program and the [[Union of Sovereign States|new union treaty]] that he had negotiated which [[decentralized]] much of the [[Government of the USSR|central government]]'s power to the [[Republics of the USSR|republics]]. They were opposed, mainly in [[Moscow]], by a short but effective campaign of [[civil resistance]]&lt;ref name="Kramer"&gt;Mark Kramer, "The Dialectics of Empire: Soviet Leaders and the Challenge of Civil Resistance in East-Central Europe, 1968–91", in [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009 [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s pp. 108–09].&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[List of leaders of the Russian SFSR|Russian president]] [[Boris Yeltsin]], who had been both an ally and critic of Gorbachev. Although the coup collapsed in only two days and Gorbachev returned to power, the event destabilized the USSR and is widely considered to have contributed to both the demise of the CPSU and the [[dissolution of the USSR]].

After the capitulation of the [[State Committee on the State of Emergency]] (GKChP), popularly referred to as the "Gang of Eight", both the Supreme Court of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR) and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev described their actions as a coup attempt.

==Background==
Since assuming power as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1985, Gorbachev had embarked on an ambitious program of reform, embodied in the twin concepts of ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'', meaning economic/political restructuring and openness, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/wc2/lectures/gorrev.html |title=''Gorbachev and Perestroika''. Professor Gerhard Rempel, Department of History, Western New England College, 1996-02-02, accessed 2008-07-12 |publisher=Mars.wnec.edu |date= |accessdate=31 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828102933/http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/wc2/lectures/gorrev.html |archivedate=28 August 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These moves prompted resistance and suspicion on the part of hardline members of the ''[[nomenklatura]]''. The reforms also unleashed some forces and movements that Gorbachev did not expect.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Specifically, [[Nationalism|nationalist]] agitation on the part of the [[Soviet Union]]'s non-[[Russians|Russian]] minorities grew, and there were fears that some or all of the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|union republics]] might secede. In 1991, the Soviet Union was in a severe economic and political crisis. Scarcity of food, medicine, and other consumables was widespread,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarker|first1=Sunil Kumar|title=The rise and fall of communism|date=1994|publisher=Atlantic publishers and distributors|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-8171565153|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rGf2b1nsn9cC&amp;dq=economic+conditions+in+the+the+Soviet+Union+1991+food&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  people had to stand in long [[Queue area|lines]] to buy even essential goods, {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} fuel stocks were up to 50% less than the estimated need for the approaching winter, and inflation was over 300% on an annual basis, with factories  lacking in cash needed to pay salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=R.C.|title=Collapse of the Soviet Union|date=1997|publisher=Krishna Prakashan Media|location=India|isbn=978-8185842813|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UwroC6xtPQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Collapse+of+the+Soviet+Union+Gupta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUnrfJranRAhWFQiYKHZgOD7oQ6AEIHDAA|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1990, [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]],&lt;ref name="Ziemele5"&gt;[[#Ziemele2005|Ziemele (2005)]]. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvia]],&lt;ref name="Ziemele8"&gt;[[#Ziemele2005|Ziemele (2005)]]. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]],&lt;ref name="Ziemele10"&gt;[[#Ziemele2005|Ziemele (2005)]]. pp. 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]] and [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgia]] had already declared the restoration of their independence from the Soviet Union. In January 1991, there was an [[January Events (Lithuania)|attempt to return Lithuania to the Soviet Union by force]]. About a week later, there was [[The Barricades|a similar attempt]] by local pro-Soviet forces to overthrow the Latvian authorities. There were continuing armed ethnic conflicts in [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Nagorno Karabakh]] and [[Georgian–Ossetian conflict|South Ossetia]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|declared its sovereignty]] on 12 June 1990 and thereafter limited the application of Soviet laws, in particular the laws concerning finance and the economy, on Russian territory. The [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR]] adopted laws which contradicted Soviet laws (the so-called [[War of Laws]]).

In the [[Soviet Union referendum, 1991|unionwide referendum on 17 March 1991]], boycotted by the [[Baltic states]], [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]], [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgia]], and [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldova]], the majority of the residents of the rest of the republics expressed the desire to retain the renewed Soviet Union. Following negotiations, eight of the nine republics (except [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]]) approved the [[Union of Sovereign States|New Union Treaty]] with some conditions. The treaty would make the Soviet Union a federation of independent republics with a common president, foreign policy, and military. [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]], [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]], and [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbekistan]] were to sign the Treaty in [[Moscow]] on 20 August 1991.

==Preparation==
On 11 December 1990, [[KGB]] Chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], made a "call for order" over Central television in Moscow.&lt;ref
name="State"&gt;[[Yevgenia Albats]] and Catherine A. Fitzpatrick. ''The State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia – Past, Present, and Future''. 1994. {{ISBN|0-374-52738-5}}, pages 276-293.&lt;/ref&gt; That day, he asked two KGB officers&lt;ref&gt;KGB Maj. Gen. Vyacheslav Zhizhin and KGB Col. Alexei Yegorov, ''The State Within a State'', p. 276–277.&lt;/ref&gt; to prepare a plan of measures that could be taken in case a [[state of emergency]] was declared in the USSR. Later, Kryuchkov brought Soviet Defense Minister [[Dmitry Yazov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] [[Valentin Pavlov]], Vice-President [[Gennady Yanayev]], Soviet Defense Council deputy chief [[Oleg Baklanov]], Gorbachev secretariat head {{Interlanguage link multi|Valery Boldin|2=ru|3=Болдин, Валерий Иванович|preserve=1|WD=}}, and [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU Central Committee Secretary]] [[Oleg Shenin]] into the conspiracy.&lt;ref name=91internalkgbreport&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.flb.ru/material.phtml?id=3632 September 1991 internal KGB report on the involvement of KGB in the coup]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NovayaGazeta51&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://2001.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2001/51n/n51n-s15.shtml "Novaya Gazeta" No. 51 of 23 July 2001] (extracts from the indictment of the conspirators)&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the [[State Committee on the State of Emergency|GKChP]] hoped that Gorbachev could be persuaded to declare the state of emergency and to "restore order".

On 23 July 1991, a number of party functionaries and literati published in the hardline newspaper ''[[Sovetskaya Rossiya]]'' as a prime factor to an anti-Perestroika manifesto entitled [[A Word to the People]].

Six days later, Gorbachev, [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[President of Kazakhstan|Kazakh President]] [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] discussed the possibility of replacing such hardliners as Pavlov, Yazov, Kryuchkov and Pugo with more liberal figures. Kryuchkov, who had placed Gorbachev under close surveillance as Subject 110 several months earlier, eventually got wind of the conversation.&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://archive.rusbg.com/viewtopic.php?p=183469&amp;sid=ab7f23384901f822938fcbc1b4e31240 Timeline of the events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127115224/http://archive.rusbg.com/viewtopic.php?p=183469&amp;sid=ab7f23384901f822938fcbc1b4e31240 |date=27 November 2007 }}, by Artem Krechnikov, Moscow BBC correspondent&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitrokhin&gt;[[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]] and [[Vasili Mitrokhin]] (2000).

On 4 August, Gorbachev went on holiday to his [[dacha]] in [[Foros, Crimea]]. He planned to return to Moscow in time for the [[Union of Sovereign States|New Union Treaty]] signing on 20 August.

On 17 August, the members of the [[State Committee on the State of Emergency|GKChP]] met at a [[KGB]] guesthouse in Moscow and studied the treaty document. They believed the pact would pave the way to the Soviet Union's breakup, and decided that it was time to act. The next day, Baklanov, Boldin, Shenin, and USSR Deputy Defense Minister General [[Valentin Varennikov]] flew to Crimea for a meeting with Gorbachev. They demanded that Gorbachev either declare a state of emergency or resign and name Yanayev as acting president to allow the members of the GKChP "to restore order" in the country.&lt;ref name=NovayaGazeta51 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NovayaGazeta59&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://2001.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2001/59n/n59n-s16.shtml ''Novaya Gazeta'' No. 59 of 20 August 2001] (extracts from the indictment of the conspirators)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kommersant79717&gt;[http://www.nr2.ru/projects/79717.html ''Kommersant''], 18 August 2006 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the [[State Committee on the State of Emergency|GKChP]] ordered 250,000 pairs of handcuffs from a factory in [[Pskov]] to be sent to Moscow&lt;ref&gt;''Revolutionary Passage'' by Marc Garcelon [https://books.google.com/books?id=2dqGABT3Yw0C&amp;pg=PA157 p. 159]&lt;/ref&gt; and 300,000 arrest forms.

==The coup chronology==
{{see also|Timeline of Soviet coup d'état attempt 1991}}
The members of the [[State Committee on the State of Emergency|GKChP]] met in the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] after Baklanov, Boldin, Shenin and Varennikov returned from Crimea. Yanayev, Pavlov and Baklanov signed the so-called "Declaration of the Soviet Leadership" in which they declared the state of emergency in all of the USSR and announced that the '''State Committee of the State of Emergency''' (Государственный Комитет по Чрезвычайному Положению, ГКЧП, or ''Gosudarstvenniy Komitet po Chrezvichaynomu Polozheniyu'', ''GKChP'') had been created "to manage the country and to effectively maintain the regime of the state of emergency". The GKChP included the following members:
* [[Gennady Yanayev]], Vice President
* [[Valentin Pavlov]], Prime Minister
* [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Head of the [[KGB]]
* [[Dmitry Yazov]], Minister of Defence
* [[Boris Pugo]], Minister of Interior
* [[Oleg Baklanov]], Member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU Central Committee]]
* [[Vasily Starodubtsev]], Chairman of the Peasant Union
* {{Interlanguage link multi|Alexander Tizyakov|ru|3=Тизяков, Александр Иванович|lt=Alexander Tizyakov}}, President of the Association of the State Enterprises and Objects of Industry, Transport, and Communications&lt;ref name=Kommersant79717 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gkchppost&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://souz.info/library/other/gkchp/gkchppost.htm GKChP documents]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yanayev signed the decree naming himself as acting USSR president on the pretext of Gorbachev's inability to perform presidential duties due to "illness".&lt;ref name=gkchppost /&gt; These eight collectively became known as the "[[State Committee on the State of Emergency|Gang of Eight]]".

The GKChP banned all newspapers in Moscow, except for nine Party-controlled newspapers.&lt;ref name=gkchppost /&gt; The GKChP also issued a populist declaration which stated that "the honour and dignity of the Soviet man must be restored."&lt;ref name=gkchppost /&gt;

===19 August===

All of the [[State Committee on the State of Emergency]] (GKChP) documents were broadcast over the state radio and television starting from 7 a.m. The Russian SFSR-controlled [[Radio Rossii]] and [[All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company|Televidenie Rossii]], plus "[[Echo of Moscow|Ekho Moskvy]]", the only independent political radio station, were cut off the air.&lt;ref name=Kommersant79720&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.nr2.ru/ekb/publications/79720.html another "Kommersant" article], 18 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Armour units of the [[2nd Guards Tamanskaya Motor Rifle Division|Tamanskaya Division]] and the [[4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division|Kantemirovskaya tank division]] rolled into Moscow along with [[Russian Airborne Troops|paratroops]]. Four [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|Russian SFSR people's deputies]] (who were considered the most "dangerous") were detained by the KGB at an army base near Moscow.&lt;ref name=91internalkgbreport /&gt; The conspirators considered detaining Russian SFSR President [[Boris Yeltsin]] upon his arrival from a visit to [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] on 17 August, or after that when he was at his [[dacha]] near Moscow, but for an undisclosed reason did not do so.

[[File:Moscow White House area 1980 Central Moscow (30849056096) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Map of White House area with 1980s street names]]
Yeltsin arrived at the [[White House (Moscow)|White House]], Russia's parliament building, at 9 am on Monday 19 August. Together with Russian SFSR [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] [[Ivan Silayev]] and [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet]] Chairman [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]], Yeltsin issued a declaration that condemned the GkChP's actions as a reactionary anti-constitutional coup. The military was urged not to take part in the coup. The declaration called for a [[general strike]] with the demand to let Gorbachev address the people.&lt;ref name=russianbook&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.russ.ru/antolog/1991|title=Путч. Хроника тревожных дней.|website=old.russ.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration was distributed around Moscow in the form of [[Pamphlet|flyers]].

In the afternoon, the citizens of Moscow began to gather around the White House and to erect barricades around it.&lt;ref name=russianbook /&gt; In response, Gennady Yanayev declared the state of emergency in Moscow at 16:00.&lt;ref name=Kommersant79717 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gkchppost /&gt; Yanayev declared at the press conference at 17:00 that Gorbachev was "resting". He said: "Over these years he has got very tired and needs some time to get his health back."&lt;ref name=Kommersant79717 /&gt;

Meanwhile, Major Evdokimov, chief of staff of a tank battalion of the [[2nd Guards Tamanskaya Motor Rifle Division|Tamanskaya Division]] guarding the White House, declared his loyalty to the leadership of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]].&lt;ref name=russianbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Izvestia", 18 August 2006 {{ru icon}}[http://www.izvestia.ru/hystory/article3095759]&lt;/ref&gt; Yeltsin climbed one of the tanks and addressed the crowd.

===20 August===
[[File:1991 coup attempt4.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tanks at the Red Square]]
At noon, [[Moscow Military District#note-0|Moscow military district]] commander General [[Nikolai Vasilyevich Kalinin (born 1937)|Kalinin]], whom Yanayev appointed as military commandant of Moscow, declared a [[curfew]] in Moscow from 23:00 to 5:00, effective from 20 August.&lt;ref name=NovayaGazeta51 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kommersant79720 /&gt;&lt;ref name=russianbook /&gt; This was understood as the sign that the attack on the White House was imminent.

The defenders of the White House prepared themselves, most of them being unarmed. Evdokimov's tanks were moved from the White House in the evening.&lt;ref name=Kommersant79717 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nezavisimoe&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://nvo.ng.ru/history/2006-08-18/1_19aug91.html "Nezavisimoe Voiennoye Obozrenie"], 18 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The makeshift White House defense headquarters was headed by General [[Konstantin Kobets]], a Russian SFSR [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|people's deputy]].&lt;ref name=Nezavisimoe /&gt;&lt;ref name=heroes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=1201|title=Усов Владимир Александрович|website=www.warheroes.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the afternoon, Kryuchkov, Yazov and Pugo finally decided to attack the White House. This decision was supported by other GKChP members. Kryuchkov and Yazov's deputies, KGB general Ageyev and Army general [[Vladislav Achalov]], respectively, planned the assault, codenamed "Operation Grom" (Thunder), which would gather elements of the [[Alpha Group|Alpha]] and [[Vympel]] elite special force units, with the support of the paratroopers, Moscow [[OMON]], the Internal Troops of the [[ODON|Dzerzhinsky division]], three tank companies and a helicopter squadron. [[Alpha Group]] commander General [[Viktor Fyodorovich Karpukhin|Viktor Karpukhin]] and other senior officers of the unit together with Airborne Troops deputy commander Gen. [[Alexander Lebed]] mingled with the crowds near the White House and assessed the possibility of such an operation. After that, Karpukhin and Vympel commander Colonel Beskov tried to convince Ageyev that the operation would result in bloodshed and should be canceled.&lt;ref name=91internalkgbreport /&gt;&lt;ref name=NovayaGazeta51 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Timeline /&gt;&lt;ref name=Argumenty&gt;[http://nd.flb.ru/?path=3&amp;info_id=1222&amp;text_version=19 "Argumenty i Facty"]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 15 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Lebed, with the consent of his immediate superior, [[Pavel Grachev]], returned to the White House and secretly informed the defense headquarters that the attack would begin at 2:00.&lt;ref name=Timeline /&gt;&lt;ref name=Argumenty /&gt;

While the events were unfolding in the capital, [[Estonia]]'s Supreme Council declared at 23:03 the full reinstatement of the independent status of the Republic of Estonia after 41 years.

===21 August===
At about 1:00, not far from the [[White House (Moscow)|White House]], [[trolleybus]]es and street cleaning machines barricaded a tunnel against oncoming Taman Guards [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s (IFVs). Three men were killed in the incident, Dmitry Komar, Vladimir Usov, and Ilya Krichevsky, while several others were wounded. Komar, a 22 year old veteran from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, was shot and crushed trying to cover a moving IFV's observation slit. Usov, a 37 year old economist, was killed by a stray bullet whilst coming to Komar's aid. The crowd set fire to an IFV and Krichevsky, a 28 year old architect, was shot dead as the troops escaped. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| work=[[The Guardian Online]] |title=Calls for recognition of 1991 Soviet coup martyrs on 20th anniversary| date=16 August 2011| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/16/soviet-coup-martyrs-anniversary|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kommersant79717 /&gt;&lt;ref name=heroes /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Russian site on Ilya Krichevsky {{cite web |url=http://amkworks113.ru/pbl/pbl-8.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811105836/http://amkworks113.ru/pbl/pbl-8.html |archivedate=11 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}.

The troops began to move from Moscow at 8:00. The GKChP members met in the Defence Ministry and, not knowing what to do, decided to send Kryuchkov, Yazov, Baklanov, Tizyakov, [[Anatoly Lukyanov]], and Deputy [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU General Secretary]] [[Vladimir Ivashko]] to Crimea to meet Gorbachev, who refused to meet them when they arrived. With the dacha's communications to Moscow restored, Gorbachev declared all the GKChP's decisions void and dismissed its members from their state offices. The [[Procurator General of the Soviet Union|USSR General Prosecutors Office]] started the investigation of the coup.&lt;ref name=Timeline /&gt;&lt;ref name=russianbook /&gt;

During that period, the Supreme Council of the [[Latvia|Republic of Latvia]] declared its sovereignty officially completed with a law passed by its deputies, confirming the independence restoration act of 4 May as an official act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=69512|title= Constitutional law On statehood of the Republic of Latvia|accessdate= 7 January 2008|author= Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR|authorlink= Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia|date= 21 August 1991|publisher=''[[Latvijas Vēstnesis]]''|language= Latvian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tallinn, just a day after the resitution of independence, the Tallinn TV Tower was taken over by the Airborne Troops,  while the television broadcast was cut off for a while, the radio signal was strong as a handful of [[Estonian Defence League]] (the unified paramilitary armed forces of Estonia) members barricaded the entry into signal rooms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.estonica.org/en/The_August_coup_and_Estonian_independence_1991/&lt;/ref&gt; In the evening, as news of the failure of the coup reached the republic, the paratroopers departed from the tower and left the capital.

==Aftermath==
Gorbachev and the GKChP delegation flew to Moscow, where [[Vladimir Kryuchkov|Kryuchkov]], [[Dmitry Yazov|Yazov]], and Tizyakov were arrested upon arrival in the early hours of 22 August. [[Boris Pugo|Pugo]] committed suicide along with his wife the next day. Pavlov, [[Vasily Starodubtsev]], [[Oleg Baklanov|Baklanov]], Boldin, and Shenin would be in custody within the next 48 hours.&lt;ref name=Timeline /&gt;

Since several heads of the regional [[Committee|executive committees]] supported the GKChP, on 21 August the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR]] adopted Decision No. 1626-1, which authorized Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] to appoint heads of regional administrations, although the Russian constitution did not empower the president with such authority.&lt;ref name=Konsultant&gt;Konsultant+ (Russian legal database){{full citation needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It passed another decision the next day which declared the [[Flag of Russia|old imperial colors]] as Russia's national flag.&lt;ref name=Konsultant /&gt; It eventually replaced the Russian SFSR flag two months later.

On the night of 24 August, the [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] statue in front of the [[Lubyanka Building|KGB building at Dzerzhinskiy Square (Lubianka)]] was dismantled, while thousands of Moscow citizens took part in the funeral of Dmitry Komar, Vladimir Usov and Ilya Krichevsky, the three citizens who died in the tunnel incident. Gorbachev posthumously awarded them with the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. Yeltsin asked their relatives to forgive him for not being able to prevent their deaths.&lt;ref name=Timeline /&gt;

===End of the CPSU===
Gorbachev resigned as [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the USSR|General Secretary]] on 24 August.&lt;ref name=Timeline /&gt; [[Vladimir Ivashko]] replaced him as acting General Secretary but resigned on 29 August when the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR|Supreme Soviet]] terminated all Party activities in Soviet territory. Around the same time, Yeltsin decreed the transfer of the CPSU archives to the state archive authorities, as well as [[nationalizing]] all CPSU assets in the Russian SFSR (which included not only the headquarters of party committees but also educational institutions, hotels, etc.).&lt;ref name=Konsultant /&gt; Yeltsin decreed the termination and banning of all Party activities on Russian soil as well as the closure of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee building]] in [[Staraya Square]].&lt;ref name=Konsultant /&gt;

===Dissolution of the Soviet Union===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
{{See also|Belavezha Accords|Dissolution of the Soviet Union}}
On 24 August, Mikhail Gorbachev created the so-called "Committee for the Operational Management of the Soviet Economy" (Комитет по оперативному управлению народным хозяйством СССР), to replace the [[Cabinet of Ministers (Soviet Union)|USSR Cabinet of Ministers]] headed by [[Valentin Pavlov]], a GKChP member. Russian prime minister [[Ivan Silayev]] headed this committee. On the same day the [[Verkhovna Rada]] adopted the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]] and called for a referendum on support of the Declaration of Independence. The [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]], the third most powerful republic in the union, also declared its independence the next day on 25 August which then established the [[Belarus|Republic of Belarus]].&lt;ref name="byind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/belarus/39.htm|title=Belarus&amp;nbsp;– Prelude to Independence|accessdate=22 December 2007|last=Fedor|first=Helen|year=1995|work=Belarus: A Country Study|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 September, the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union]] adopted Soviet Law No. 2392-1 "On the Authorities of the Soviet Union in the Transitional Period" under which the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] had replaced Congress of People's Deputies and was reformed. Two new legislative chambers—the Soviet of the Union (Совет Союза) and the Soviet of Republics (Совет Республик)—replaced the [[Soviet of the Union]] and the [[Soviet of Nationalities]] (both elected by the USSR Congress of Peoples Deputies). The Soviet of the Union was to be formed by the popularly elected USSR [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|people's deputies]]. The Soviet of Republics was to include 20 deputies from each union republic plus one deputy to represent each [[autonomous region]] of each union republic (both USSR [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|people's deputies]] and republican [[Congress of People's Deputies (disambiguation)|people's deputies]]) delegated by the legislatures of the union republic. Russia was an exception with 52 deputies. However, the delegation of each union republic was to have only one vote in the Soviet of Republics. The laws were to be first adopted by the Soviet of the Union and then by the Soviet of Republics.

Also created was the [[State Council of the Soviet Union|Soviet State Council]] (Государственный совет СССР), which included the [[President of the Soviet Union|Soviet President]] and the presidents of union republics. The "Committee for the Operational Management of the Soviet Economy" was replaced by the USSR Inter-republican Economic Committee (Межреспубликанский экономический комитет СССР), also headed by [[Ivan Silayev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravo.levonevsky.org/baza/soviet/sssr0036.htm|title=Закон СССР от 05.09.1991 N 2392-1 об органах государственной|website=pravo.levonevsky.org|access-date=27 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713021550/http://pravo.levonevsky.org/baza/soviet/sssr0036.htm|archive-date=13 July 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 August, the first state became independent, when the [[Parliament of the Republic of Moldova|Supreme Soviet of Moldova]] declared the independence of [[Moldova]] from the Soviet Union. The Supreme Soviets of Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan did the same on 30 and 31 August respectively. Afterwards, on 6 September the newly created Soviet State Council recognized the independence of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rian.ru/history/20050906/41308028.html|title=6 сентября|date=5 September 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estonia had declared re-independence on 20 August, Latvia on the following day, while Lithuania had done so already on 11 March 1990. Three days later, on 9 September the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic|Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan]] declared the independence of [[Tajikistan]] from the Soviet Union. Furthermore, in September over 99% percent of voters in [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]] voted for a referendum approving the Republic's commitment to independence. The immediate aftermath of that vote was the Armenian [[Supreme Soviet]]'s declaration of independence, issued on 21 September. By 27 October the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Supreme Soviet of Turkmenistan]] declared the independence of [[Turkmenistan]] from the Soviet Union. On 1 December Ukraine held a referendum, in which more than 90% of residents supported the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Act of Independence of Ukraine]].

By November, the only Soviet Republics that had not declared independence were Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. That same month, seven republics (Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan) agreed to a new union treaty that would form a confederation called the Union of Sovereign States. However, this confederation never materialized.

On 8 December [[Boris Yeltsin]], [[Leonid Kravchuk]] and [[Stanislav Shushkevich]]—respectively leaders of [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Belarus]] (which adopted that name in August 1991)—as well as the prime ministers of the republics met in [[Minsk]], the capital of Belarus, where they signed the [[Belavezha Accords]]. This document declared that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist "as a subject of international law and geopolitical reality." It repudiated the [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|1922 union treaty]] that established the Soviet Union, and established the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) in the Union's place. On 12 December, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR ratified the accords and recalled the Russian deputies from the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Although this has been interpreted as the moment that Russia seceded from the Union, in fact Russia took the line that it was not possible to secede from a state that no longer existed. The lower chamber of the Supreme Soviet, the Council of the Union, was forced to halt its operations, as the departure of the Russian deputies left it without a quorum.

Doubts remained about the legitimacy of the signing that took place on 8 December, since only three republics took part. Thus, on 21 December in [[Almaty|Alma-Ata]] on 21 December, the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]] expanded the CIS to include [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and the five republics of [[Central Asia]]. They also pre-emptively accepted Gorbachev's resignation. With 11 of the 12 remaining republics (all except [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) having agreed that the Union no longer existed, Gorbachev bowed to the inevitable and said he would resign as soon as the CIS became a reality (Georgia joined the CIS in 1993, only to withdraw in 2008 after [[Russo-Georgian War|conflict between Georgia and Russia]]; the three Baltic states never joined instead going on to join the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]] in 2004.)

On 24 December 1991, the Russian SFSR--now renamed [[Russia|the Russian Federation]]--with the concurrence of the other republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States, informed the [[United Nations]] that it would [[Russia and the United Nations|inherit the Soviet Union's membership in the UN]]--including the Soviet Union's permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031123143520/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/inf397.shtml Letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations from the President of the Russian Federation]&lt;/ref&gt; No member state of the UN formally objected to this step. The legitimacy of this act has been [[Russia and the United Nations#Legality|questioned by some legal scholars]] as the Soviet Union itself was not constitutionally succeeded by the Russian Federation, but merely dissolved. Others argued that the international community had already established the precedent of recognizing the Soviet Union as the legal successor of the [[Russian Empire]], and so recognizing [[Russia|the Russian Federation]] as the Soviet Union's successor state was valid.

On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev announced his resignation as Soviet president. The red hammer and sickle flag of the Soviet Union was lowered from the Senate building in the Kremlin and replaced with the tricolor flag of Russia. The next day, 26 December 1991, the Council of Republics, the upper chamber of the Supreme Soviet, formally voted the Soviet Union out of existence, thus ending the life of the world's first and oldest socialist state. All former Soviet embassies became Russian embassies while Russia received the nuclear weapons from the other former republics by 1996. A [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] occurred in 1993 had been escalated into violence and the new [[Constitution of Russia|constitution]] adopted officially abolished the entire Soviet government.

===Beginning of radical economic reforms in Russia===
{{See also|Economic history of the Russian Federation}}
On 1 November 1991, the [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|RSFSR Congress of People's Deputies]] issued Decision No. 1831-1 On the Legal Support of the Economic Reform whereby the Russian president ([[Boris Yeltsin]]) was granted the right to issue decrees required for the economic reform even if they contravened the laws. Such decrees entered into force if they were not repealed within 7 days by the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR]] or its Presidium.&lt;ref name=Konsultant /&gt; Five days later, Boris Yeltsin, in addition to the duties of the President, assumed the duties of the prime minister. [[Yegor Gaidar]] became deputy prime minister and simultaneously economic and finance minister. On 15 November 1991 Boris Yeltsin issued Decree No. 213 On the Liberalization of Foreign Economic Activity on the Territory of the RSFSR whereby all Russian companies were allowed to import and to export goods and to acquire foreign currency (previously all foreign trade had been tightly controlled by the state).&lt;ref name=Konsultant /&gt; Following the issuing of Decree No. 213, on 3 December 1991 Boris Yeltsin issued Decree No. 297 On the Measures to Liberalize Prices whereby from 2 January 1992 most previously existing [[price controls]] were abolished.&lt;ref name=Konsultant /&gt;

===Trial of the members of the GKChP===
The [[State Committee on the State of Emergency|GKChP]] members and their accomplices were charged with [[treason]] in the form of a conspiracy aimed at capturing power. However, by the end of 1992 they were all released from custody pending trial. The trial in the Military Chamber of the [[Supreme Court of Russia|Russian Supreme Court]] began on 14 April 1993.&lt;ref&gt;"Vzgliad", 18 August 2006 {{ru icon}}[http://vzglyad.ru/politics/2006/8/18/45786.html]&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 February 1994 the [[State Duma]] declared [[amnesty]] for all GKChP members and their accomplices, along with the participants of the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|October 1993 crisis]].&lt;ref name=Konsultant /&gt; They all accepted the amnesty, except for General Varennikov, who demanded the continuation of the trial and was finally acquitted on 11 August 1994.&lt;ref name=Timeline /&gt;

===Commemoration of the civilians killed===

Thousands of people attended the funeral of Dmitry Komar, Ilya Krichevsky and Vladimir Usov on the 24 August 1991. [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] made the three men posthumous [[Hero of the Soviet Union|Heroes of the Soviet Union]], for their bravery "blocking the way to those who wanted to strangle democracy.". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| work=[[The New York Times]] |title=SOVIET TURMOIL; Moscow Mourns And Exalts Men Killed by Coup| date=25 August 1991| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/25/world/soviet-turmoil-moscow-mourns-and-exalts-men-killed-by-coup.html|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentary commission===
In 1991 the Parliamentary Commission for Investigating Causes and Reasons of the coup attempt was established under [[Lev Ponomaryov]], but in 1992 it was dissolved at [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]]'s insistence.

==International reactions==

==={{flag|United States}}===
[[File:Bush Gorba P15623-25A.jpg|thumb|George H.W. Bush, left, is seen with Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990. Bush condemned the coup and the actions of the "Gang of Eight".]]
During his vacation in [[Kennebunkport, Maine]], the [[President of the United States]], [[George H.W. Bush]] made a blunt demand for Gorbachev's restoration to power and said the United States did not accept the legitimacy of the self-proclaimed new Soviet Government. He returned to the White House after rushing from his vacation home. Bush then issued a strongly-worded statement that followed a day of consultations with other leaders of the Western alliance and a concerted effort to squeeze the new Soviet leadership by freezing economic aid programs. He decried the coup as a "misguided and illegitimate effort" that "bypasses both Soviet law and the will of the [[Soviet people]]s."  President Bush called the overthrow "very disturbing," and he put a hold on U.S. aid to the Soviet Union until the coup was ended.&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl&gt;{{Cite web | title = World reacts with shock to Gorbachev ouster | last = Isherwood | first = Julian M.  | agency = United Press International | date = 19 August 1991 | accessdate = 31 May 2017 | url = http://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/08/19/World-reacts-with-shock-to-Gorbachev-ouster/5234533009911/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/20/world/the-soviet-crisis-bush-condemns-soviet-coup-and-calls-for-its-reversal.html|title=THE SOVIET CRISIS; Bush Condemns Soviet Coup And Calls For Its Reversal|first=Andrew|last=Rosenthal|date=20 August 1991|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bush statement, drafted after a series of meetings with top aides at the White House, was much more forceful than the President's initial reaction that morning in Maine. It was in keeping with a unified Western effort to apply both diplomatic and economic pressure to the group of Soviet officials seeking to gain control of the country.

Former President [[Ronald Reagan]] had said: "I can't believe that the Soviet people will allow a reversal in the progress that they have recently made toward economic and political freedom. Based on my extensive meetings and conversations with him, I am convinced that President Gorbachev had the best interest of the Soviet people in mind. I have always felt that his opposition came from the communist bureaucracy, and I can only hope that enough progress was made that a movement toward democracy will be unstoppable."&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;

On September 2, 1991, the United States re-recognized the independence of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] when Bush delivered the press conference in Kennebunkport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/03/world/soviet-turmoil-excerpts-bush-s-conference-strong-support-for-baltic-independence.html|title=SOVIET TURMOIL; Excerpts From Bush's Conference: 'Strong Support' for Baltic Independence|date=3 September 1991|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{flag|United Kingdom}}===
The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[John Major]] had expressed feelings in a 1991 interview on behalf of the UK about the coup and said "I think there are many reasons why it failed and a great deal of time and trouble will be spent on analysing that later. There were, I think, a number of things that were significant. I don’t think it was terribly well-handled from the point of view of those organising the coup. I think the enormous and unanimous condemnation of the rest of the world publicly of the coup was of immense encouragement to the people resisting it. That is not just my view; that is the view that has been expressed to me by Mr. Shevardnadze, Mr. Yakovlev, President Yeltsin and many others as well to whom I have spoken to the last 48 hours. The moral pressure from the West and the fact that we were prepared to state unequivocally that the coup was illegal and that we wanted the legal government restored, was of immense help in the Soviet Union. I think that did play a part."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page2106.html|title=Mr Major's Comments on the Soviet Coup - 21st August 1991|website=www.johnmajor.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major met with his cabinet that same day on 19 August to deal with the crisis. He added, "There seems little doubt that President Gorbachev has been removed from power by an unconstitutional seizure of power. There are constitutional ways of removing the president of the Soviet Union; they have not been used. I believe that the whole world has a very serious stake in the events currently taking place in the Soviet Union. The reform process there is of vital importance to the world and of most vital importance of course to the Soviet people themselves and I hope that is fully clear. There is a great deal of information we don't yet have, but I would like to make clear above all that we would expect the Soviet Union to respect and honor all the commitments that President Gorbachev has made on its behalf,'' he said, echoing sentiments from a litany of other Western leaders."&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;

However, the British Government had frozen $80 million in economic aid to Moscow, and the European Community scheduled an emergency meeting in which it was expected to suspend a $1.5 billion aid program.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

===Other sovereign states===
*{{flag|Australia}}: Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] said "The developments in the Soviet Union ... raise the question as to whether the purpose is to reverse the political and economic reforms which have been taking place. Australia does not want to see repression, persecution or vindictive actions against Gorbachev or those associated with him."&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;
*{{flag|Bulgaria}}: President [[Zhelyu Zhelev]] has stated "Such anti-democratic methods can never lead to anything good neither for the Soviet Union, nor for Eastern Europe, nor for the democratic developments in the world."&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;
*{{flag|Canada}}: Several reactions to coup quickly happened such as the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Brian Mulroney]] had huddled with his top advisers discussed the toppling of Mikhail Gorbachev, but his officials said the Prime Minister will likely react cautiously to the stunning development. Mulroney condemned the coup and suspended food aid and other assurances with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/25/world/canadian-is-attacked-for-remarks-on-soviet-coup.html|title=Canadian Is Attacked for Remarks on Soviet Coup|first=Clyde H.|last=Farnsworth|date=25 August 1991|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  External Affairs Minister [[Barbara McDougall]] suggested on August 20, 1991 that "Canada could work with any Soviet junta that promises to carry on Gorbachev's legacy, Lloyd Axworthy and Liberal Leader Jean Chretien said Canada must join with other Western governments to back Russian President Boris Yeltsin, former Soviet foreign minister and Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze and others fighting for Soviet democracy." McDougall met with the chargé d'affaires of the Soviet embassy, Vasily Sredin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/doc/436458189.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+21,+1991&amp;author=Tim+Harper+Toronto+Star&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.4&amp;desc=McDougall+hints+Ottawa+may+recognize+Moscow+junta|title=archives|website=thestar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*{{flag|China}}: The Chinese government appeared tacitly to support the coup when it issued a statement saying the move was an internal affair of the Soviet Union and the [[Communist Party of China]] released no immediate comment. Confidential Chinese documents have indicated that China's hardline leaders strongly disapprove of Gorbachev's program of political liberalization, blaming him for "the loss of Eastern Europe to capitalism." Several Chinese people said that a key difference between the Soviet coup leaders' failed attempts to use tanks to crush dissent in Moscow and the hard-line Chinese leaders' successful use of tank-led forces to smash the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|1989 protest movement]] was that the Soviet people had a powerful leader like Russian President Boris Yeltsin to rally around, whereas the Chinese protesters did not. The Soviet coup collapsed in three days without any major violence by the Soviet army against civilians; in June 1989, the [[People's Liberation Army]] killed hundreds of people to crush the democracy movement. "People all over Beijing are celebrating the failure of the coup tonight," said a young intellectual reached in Beijing today after word of the coup's collapse spread through the Chinese capital, mostly by way of foreign radio broadcasts. "I personally know of some Communist Party members who are also celebrating."&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/08/23/chinese-dissidents-hail-moscow-events/6fea0a33-ccc8-4e93-b6d5-665faa846e64/|title=CHINESE DISSIDENTS HAIL MOSCOW EVENTS|first1=Daniel|last1=Southerl|first2=Daniel|last2=Southerl|date=23 August 1991|publisher=|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flagdeco|Czechoslovakia}} [[Czech and Slovak Federal Republic|Czechoslovakia]]: [[Vaclav Havel]], the Czechoslovak president, warned his nation could face a possible "wave of refugees" crossing its border with the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]. However, Havel said "It is not possible to reverse the changes that have already happened in the Soviet Union. We believe democracy will eventually prevail in the Soviet Union."&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt; Interior Ministry spokesman Martin Fendrych said an unspecified number of additional troops had been moved to reinforce the [[Slovakia–Ukraine border|Czechoslovak border]] with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;
*{{flag|Denmark}}: Foreign Minister [[Uffe Ellemann-Jensen]] said the process of change in the Soviet Union could not be reversed. In a statement he said, "So much has happened and so many people have been involved in the changes in Soviet Union that I cannot see a total reversal."&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;
*{{flag|France}}: [[President of France|President]] [[François Mitterrand]] called on the new rulers of the Soviet Union to guarantee the ''life and liberty'' of Gorbachev and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who was "Gorbachev's rival in the changing Soviet Union." Mitterrand added, "France attaches a high price to the life and liberty of Messrs. Gorbachev and Yeltsin being guaranteed by the new Moscow leaders. These will be judged by their acts, especially on the fashion in which the two high personalities in question will be treated."&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;
*{{flag|Germany}}: [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]] cut his vacation short in Austria and returned to [[Bonn]] for an emergency meeting. Kohl had said he was sure Moscow would withdraw its remaining 272,000 troops from the [[former East Germany]] on schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/doc/436460688.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+20,+1991&amp;author=&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.17&amp;desc=Keep+up+reform,+Kohl+urges+Soviets|title=archives|website=thestar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Björn Engholm]], leader of Germany's opposition [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]], urged member states of the [[European Community]] "to speak with one voice" on the situation and said "the West should not exclude the possibility of imposing economic and political sanctions on the Soviet Union to avoid a jolt to the right," in Moscow."&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;
*{{flag|Greece}}: Greece described the situation in the Soviet Union as "alarming". The Communist-led Alliance of the Left and former Socialist Prime Minister [[Andreas Papandreou]] both issued statements condemning the coup.&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;
*{{flag|Hungary}}: Deputy Speaker of Parliament [[Mátyás Szűrös]] said the coup increased the risk of a civil war in the Soviet Union. "Undoubtedly, the Soviet economy has collapsed but this has not been the result of Gorbachev's policy but of the paralyzing influence of conservatives" Szűrös said. "Suddenly, the likelihood of a civil war in the Soviet Union has increased."&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;
*{{flag|Ba'athist Iraq|name=Iraq}}: [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Iraq was a close ally of the Soviet Union until it condemned Baghdad during the [[Gulf War]]. One Iraqi spokesman quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency: "It is natural that we welcome such change like the states and people who were affected by the policies of the former regime." &lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;
*{{flag|Israel}}: Israeli officials said they hoped Gorbachev's attempted removal had not derailed  the [[Madrid Conference of 1991|conference held in Madrid]] or a slower Soviet Jewish immigration. The quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, which has coordinated the massive flow of Jews arriving from the Soviet Union, called an emergency meeting to assess how the coup would affect Jewish immigration. "We are closely following what is happening in the Soviet Union with concern," Foreign Minister David Levy said. "One might say that this is an internal issue of the Soviet Union, but in the Soviet Union ... everything internal has an influence for the entire world."&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;
*{{flag|Italy}}: Prime Minister [[Giulio Andreotti]] released a statement and said  "I'm surprised, embittered and worried. We all know the difficulties that Gorbachev encountered. But I don't know how a new president, who, at least for now, doesn't have (Gorbachev's) prestige and international connections, can overcome the obstacles." Achille Occhetto, the head of what was once the [[Italian Communist Party]], called the ouster of Gorbachev "a most dramatic event of world proportions (which) will have immense repercussions on international life. I am personally and strongly struck, not only for the incalculable burden of this event, but also for the fate of comrade Gorbachev."&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;
*{{flag|Japan}}: Prime Minister [[Toshiki Kaifu]] ordered the Foreign Ministry to analyze the developments. "I strongly hope that the leadership change will not influence the positive policies of perestroika and new thinking diplomacy." said Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Misoji Sakamoto]].&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt; In addition, Soviet aid and technical loans from Japan was frozen.&lt;ref name=Gupta&gt;R.C. Gupta. (1997) ''Collapse of the Soviet Union''. p. 57. {{ISBN|9788185842813}},&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|South Korea|1984}}: [[President of South Korea|President]] [[Roh Tae-woo]] welcomed the coup's collapse as a symbolic victory for the Soviet people. He quoted "It was a triumph of the courage and resolve of the Soviet citizens towards freedom and democracy."&lt;ref name=Gupta /&gt;
*{{flag|Philippines|1986}}: Philippine President [[Corazon Aquino]] expressed "grave concern" and said "We hope that the progress toward world peace... achieved under the leadership of President Gorbachev will continue to be preserved and enhanced further."&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;
*{{flag|Poland}}: In a statement released by the [[President of Poland|President]] [[Lech Walesa]], whose [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] union helped prompt the collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe, appealed for calm. "May unity and responsibility for our state gain the upper hand." Walesa said in a statement read on Polish radio by spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski, "The situation in the U.S.S.R. is significant for our country, It can affect our bilateral relations. We want then to be friendly." But he emphasized Poland kept its hard-won sovereignty while it pursued its economic and political reforms.&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;
*{{flag|South Africa|1928}}: Foreign Minister [[Pik Botha]] said: "I very much hope that (developments in the Soviet Union) will neither give rise to large-scale turbulence within the Soviet Union itself or more widely in Europe, nor jeopardize the era of hard-won international cooperation upon which the world has embarked."&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;
*{{flag|Yugoslavia}}: The country, [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|consumed by its own internal dissent]], followed the coup closely. "I am afraid that conservatives in Yugoslavia may now try to grab power in our country, when they see how conservatives removed Gorbachev," a 51-year-old schoolteacher said. "Gorbachev has done the most to bring a sort of democracy to both Eastern European countries and to the Soviet Union." Dragan Radic, 57, an economist, had said: "Gorbachev has done a lot for world peace and helped replace hard-line [[Revolutions of 1989|communist regimes in the past few years]]. Yet, the West failed to support Gorbachev financially and economically and he was forced to step down because he could not feed the [[Soviet people]]."&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;

===Supranational bodies and organizations===
*{{flag|NATO}}: The alliance held an emergency meeting in Brussels condemning the Soviet coup. "If indeed this coup did fail, it will be a great victory for the courageous Soviet people who have tasted freedom and who are not prepared to have it taken away from them." the United States Secretary of State [[James A. Baker III]] said "It will also, to some extent, be a victory, too, for the international community and for all those governments who reacted strongly to these events." NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner also said, "We should see how the situation in the Soviet Union develops. Our own plans will take into account what happens there."&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-08-21/news/9103020365_1_foreign-ministers-kremlin-coup-coup-leaders|title=Nato`s Response Covers All Bases|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|Palestine Liberation Organization}} – The Palestinian Liberation Organization was dissatisfied with the coup. [[Yasser Abed Rabdo]], who was a member of the PLO Executive Committee, said he hoped the putsch "will permit resolution in the best interests of the Palestinians of the problem of Soviet Jews in Israel."&lt;ref name=SovietCoup_Intl /&gt;

The '''2009 Taconic State Parkway crash''' was a [[traffic collision]] that occurred shortly after {{nowrap|1:30 p.m.}} on Sunday, July 26, 2009, on the [[Taconic State Parkway]] in the town of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]], near the village of [[Briarcliff Manor, New York|Briarcliff Manor]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Snedeker|first=Louise|title=Wrong Way Tragedy: Supporting First Responders|url=http://rivertowns.dailyvoice.com/news/wrong-way-tragedy-supporting-first-responders|publisher=The Rivertowns Daily Voice|accessdate=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight people were killed when a minivan being driven by 36-year-old Diane Schuler traveled 1.7 miles in the wrong direction on the parkway and collided head-on with an oncoming SUV.

The ensuing investigation into the crash's cause received nationwide attention. [[Toxicology]] tests conducted by the [[medical examiner]] revealed that Schuler was heavily intoxicated with both [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[marijuana]] at the time of the crash. Schuler's husband, Daniel, has consistently denied that she used drugs or alcohol "excessively", and has made multiple national media appearances to defend his wife and call for further investigation into other possible medical causes for her erratic driving. An independent investigator hired by the Schuler family obtained [[DNA]] testing and toxicology testing of Schuler's samples, and also confirmed the results of the original testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1107/26/ijvm.01.html|title=Interview with Tom Ruskin|work=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At approximately {{nowrap|9:30 a.m.}} on Sunday, July 26, 2009, 36-year-old Diane Schuler left the Hunter Lake Campground in [[Parksville, New York|Parksville]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in a red 2003 [[Ford Windstar]] that belonged to her brother. Riding with Schuler were her 5-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter, and her brother's three daughters (ages 8, 7, and 5). Her husband, Daniel Schuler, left the campground at the same time in a separate vehicle since he had a pickup truck and took the dog with him.&lt;ref name="nypost"&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/08052009/news/regionalnews/crash_mom_was_fully_loaded_183033.htm "Crash Mom Was Fully 'Loaded'"], ''New York Post'', August 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;[http://wcbstv.com/topstories/diane.schuler.crash.2.1119932.html NY Police: Woman Was OK at Restaurant Before Crash] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816232116/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/diane.schuler.crash.2.1119932.html |date=2009-08-16 }}, WCBS, Aug 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lohud1"&gt;Fitz-Gibbon J, Bandler J., [http://www.lohud.com/article/20090803/NEWS01/308030034/1020/rss0103 "A Week after the Crash, Questions Remain]," ''The Journal News'' (Lower Hudson), August 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A co-owner of the campground later said that Diane Schuler appeared [[sobriety|sober]] when she departed.&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"&gt;Gendar, A., Chapman, B., Goldsmith, S.,[http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/08/04/2009-08-04_diane_schuler_mom_who_drove_van_wrong_way_on_the_taconic_killing_8_was_drunk_on_.html Driver in deadly Taconic crash Diane Schuler was drunk, had marijuana in system], New York Daily News, August 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090805/NEWS/908050350 "Taconic-Crash Mom Drunk, High, Tests Reveal]," ''Times Herald-Record'', August 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the way to [[West Babylon, New York|West Babylon]], Schuler stopped at a [[McDonald's]] fast-food restaurant and a Sunoco gas station in [[Liberty (village), New York|Liberty]]. While at the gas station, on surveillance video with no sound, it was reported  that she attempted to buy [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] pain-relief medication, possibly for a painful tooth, but the gas station did not sell any.&lt;ref name="sunoco"&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/private-eye-wrong-way-driver-stopped-at-ny-store-1.1368102 "Private Eye: Wrong-Way Driver Stopped at NY Store]," ''Associated Press'', August 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sunoco2"&gt;Lam, C., [http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/schuler-s-husband-meets-again-with-state-police-1.1371064 Schuler's husband meets again with State Police], New York Newsday, August 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schuler left Liberty just after {{nowrap|11 a.m.}}, traveling along [[New York State Route 17|Route 17]]/[[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]] and the New York Thruway ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|Interstate 87]]), entering the [[Ramapo, New York|Ramapo]] service area, and crossing the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955–2017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]], heading east.&lt;ref name="lohud1"/&gt; Several witnesses later reported seeing a red minivan driving aggressively on Route 17/Interstate 86 and Interstate 87, including aggressively tailgating, flashing headlights, honking the horn, moving in and out of lanes, and straddling two lanes.&lt;ref name="lohud1"/&gt; At {{nowrap|11:37 a.m.}}, Schuler called Warren Hance, her brother and father of her three nieces, from the van. She reportedly told him that they were being delayed by [[traffic]].&lt;ref name="nytimestimeline1"&gt;Baker, A., and Kovaleski, S., [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/nyregion/08crash.html "Alcohol and Phone-Call Details in Wrong-Way Crash]," ''The New York Times'', August 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a police report, Schuler was seen by witnesses at approximately {{nowrap|11:45 a.m.}} by the side of the road with her hands on her knees, as if [[vomiting]]; she was seen again in the same position a short time later, north of the Ramapo rest stop.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Kieran.

[[File:Chevrolet TrailBlazer EXT -- 12-21-2011 2.jpg|thumb|2004 [[Chevrolet TrailBlazer]]]]
At about {{nowrap|1 p.m.}}, another call was made to Hance from Schuler's cell phone. During this call, one of Schuler's nieces reportedly told her father that Schuler was having trouble seeing and speaking clearly. Schuler herself then talked to Hance and said that she was disoriented and could not see clearly. Police believe that the car was stopped in a pull-off area beyond the Tappan Zee Bridge [[Toll road|tollbooth]]s for at least part of this call. Hance reportedly told Schuler to stay off the road while he came to meet them; follow-up calls from Hance to Schuler were not answered. For some unknown reason, she left her cell phone on the highway, which was found by another motorist by the side of the road near the toll lanes of the Tappan Zee Bridge.&lt;ref name="lohud1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimestimeline1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timeline2"&gt;Cohen S, and Bandler J, [http://lohud.com/article/20090730/NEWS02/907300377/-1/SPORTS "Driver Spoke on Phone with Brother 25 Minutes Before Fatal Crash] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817162115/http://lohud.com/article/20090730/NEWS02/907300377/-1/SPORTS |date=2009-08-17 }}," ''The Journal News'' (Lower Hudson), July 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimestimeline2"&gt;Baker, A., [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/03/nyregion/03crash.html "Investigators Reconstruct a Route That Led to 8 Deaths]," ''The New York Times'', August 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators were trying to determine how (and why) Schuler got from the bridge to the [[Taconic State Parkway]] ramps near [[Briarcliff Manor, New York|Briarcliff Manor]], New York, which is from where the next information in this timeline comes.

At {{nowrap|1:33 p.m.}}, two drivers called [[9-1-1|911]] after noticing Schuler's van edging onto the northbound exit ramp of the Taconic State Parkway near Briarcliff Manor. The end of the exit ramp ({{coord|41.142734|-73.814038|format=dms|type:event|display=inline}}), at the intersection with Pleasantville Road, is marked with two signs that read "[[Road signs in the United States#R5 Series: Exclusionary|Do Not Enter]]" and two signs that read "[[Road signs in the United States#R6 Series: One Way and Divided Highway|One Way]]".&lt;ref name="timeline3"&gt;Foderado, L.W., Schweber, N.,[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/nyregion/28crash.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion "Bad Omens, a Fateful Turn, and 8 Lives Lost]," ''The New York Times'', July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marchant, R., [http://lohud.com/article/20090728/NEWS01/907280355/-1/SPORTS "Wrong-way Turn onto Taconic Puzzles Many] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731111602/http://lohud.com/article/20090728/NEWS01/907280355/-1/SPORTS |date=2009-07-31 }}," ''The Journal News'' (Lower Hudson), July 28, 2009 (Video).&lt;/ref&gt; Within the next minute, four more 911 calls were placed by motorists who reported that a car was traveling the wrong way down the [[parkway]] going approximately 75-85&amp;nbsp;mph.

[[File:99-04_Chevrolet_Tracker.jpg|thumb|2002 [[Chevrolet Tracker (Americas)|Chevrolet Tracker]]]]
The van traveled south for 1.7 miles in the parkway's northbound [[passing lane]] before colliding head-on, at approximately {{nowrap|1:35 p.m.}}, with a 2004 [[Chevrolet TrailBlazer]], which then struck a 2002 [[Chevrolet Tracker]]. At the time of impact, Schuler was traveling approximately 85&amp;nbsp;mph. Schuler, her daughter, and two of her nieces were dead at the scene of the crash (the children did not appear to have been in car seats, or even to have had [[seatbelt]]s fastened), along with the three men in the TrailBlazer: 81-year-old Michael Bastardi, his 49-year-old son Guy, and their friend, 74-year-old Dan Longo. The two occupants of the Tracker suffered only minor injuries. Schuler's severely injured third niece and Schuler's 5-year-old son Bryan were taken to area hospitals, where the niece died later that day.&lt;ref name="lohud1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gorman, S., [http://lohud.com/article/20090810/NEWS02/908100324/-1/SPORTS "Child's Helpless Eyes Haunt Ossining Firefighter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813094605/http://lohud.com/article/20090810/NEWS02/908100324/-1/SPORTS |date=2009-08-13 }}," ''The Journal News'' (Lower Hudson), August 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan is the only passenger of Schuler's vehicle to survive, suffering from broken bones and severe [[head trauma]].

''[[New York Daily News]]'', 2009-10-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two men who witnessed the accident and smoke rising out of the van ran to assist the occupants. After removing Schuler from the van, the two men saw a large, broken [[Absolut Vodka]] bottle by the driver's side. The men tried to pull the girls out of the van, and noted that they had no pulse. Because the children possibly were not seat belted in and thrown together, the men did not even notice Bryan stuck under another child. Bryan was the only survivor of the accident.

== Intoxication levels ==
The investigation of the collision drew nationwide attention, as Schuler's husband strongly disagreed with the conclusion that she was heavily [[alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] at the time of the crash.&lt;ref name=briarcliffdv /&gt; A [[toxicology]] report released on August 4 by [[Westchester County]] [[medical examiner]]s found that Schuler had a [[blood-alcohol content]] (BAC) of 0.19%, with approximately six grams of alcohol in her stomach that had not yet been absorbed into her blood.&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ferran0804"&gt;Ferran, Lee.

In an August 8 press conference, Daniel Schuler and his attorney Dominic Barbara initially denied that Diane did drugs or was drinking that weekend at the lake since several children were with them. Schuler then changed the story and consistently denied that his wife ever "drank to excess" or could have been drunk while driving that day.&lt;ref name="fitz0806"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/08/07/earlyshow/main5223923.shtml "Wrong-Way Crash: "Diane Would Not Do This]."

Daniel Schuler denied that his wife did drugs, but told investigators that his wife smoked marijuana only "occasionally," and the family told ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine that she used it to relieve [[insomnia]].&lt;ref name="sunoco2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crowley"/&gt; Although Daniel Schuler was an officer in the Public Security Unit of the [[Nassau County Police Department]], he was not required to report his wife's drug use as he is a civilian.&lt;ref name="sunoco2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimestopics"&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/diane_schuler/index.html New York Times Topics: Diane Schuler],''[[The New York Times]]'', 2009-08-06.&lt;/ref&gt; In November, it was reported that Schuler's sister-in-law had made a statement to police that she actually smoked marijuana on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="millman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt1106"/&gt;

Daniel Schuler and attorney Barbara believed that Schuler drove erratically due to a medical issue, such as a [[stroke]].&lt;ref name="fitz0806"/&gt; According to Barbara, Schuler was [[obese]] for much of her life and suffered from [[diabetes]], although additional sources cite Schuler as only having had [[gestational diabetes]], a temporary condition related to a prior [[pregnancy]], rather than a chronic condition. Barbara has also mentioned an [[abscess]] that had persisted in her mouth for seven weeks before her death, and a lump in her leg, about which he said, "[It] might have been an [[embolism]]".&lt;ref name="fitz0806"/&gt; The results of an [[autopsy]] conducted by a Westchester County medical examiner one day after the accident found that Schuler had not suffered a stroke, [[aneurysm]], or [[heart attack]].&lt;ref name="amon0728"&gt;Amon, Michael.

In September, New York's top forensic pathologist said that a [[hair test]] should have been done to determine Schuler's drug history.&lt;ref name="amon0901"/&gt; Daniel Schuler and his lawyer announced plans to [[exhumation|exhume]] the body to perform the hair test and other examinations; experts said that this was unlikely to produce any new information of value since tests from two separate labs came up with exactly the same conclusion.&lt;ref name="lohud0903"/&gt; Schuler also intended to re-test the fluid samples taken during the autopsy.&lt;ref name="amon0908"/&gt; The Westchester County medical examiner's office, which performed the autopsy, said that the degradation of the fluids over time was likely to result in lowered alcohol and THC readings; however, several toxicology experts said that the results should be similar to the previous test if the fluid samples had been properly stored.&lt;ref name="amon0908"/&gt; On November 7, Ruskin announced that the Schuler family had raised the money to retest Schuler's tissue samples and that the retesting would take place soon.&lt;ref name="millman"/&gt; In July 2010, it was reported that Daniel Schuler had accepted a $100,000 offer from a film company, Moxie Firecracker Films, to record his wife's exhumation for an [[HBO]] documentary.

''[[MSNBC]]'', 2009-09-04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zmudzien|first=Redmond|title=Bastardi Jr. Says HBO Documentary was a "Farce"|url=http://tarrytown.dailyvoice.com/neighbors/bastardi-jr-says-hbo-documentary-was-farce|publisher=The Tarrytown Daily Voice}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Schuler appeared on [[CNN]]'s ''[[Larry King Live]]'' to demand more testing of his wife's remains, Longo's brother Joseph issued a statement saying in part, "I want Daniel Schuler to know that he keeps inflicting more pain on all concerned once again [by] going to the media to try [to] paint a picture of a perfect wife and mother."&lt;ref name="lohud0903"/&gt; Bastardi's daughters appeared with their lawyer on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', during which they questioned Daniel's culpability in [[enabling]] his wife's substance abuse and called for him to undergo drug testing himself. "It makes me angry that he keeps denying it," said Margaret Nicotina, Bastardi's daughter. "Every time he does it, he brings it back for us. I just wish that he would just admit that she was drunk. Maybe if he knows what happened that morning, if they argued or anything, that would be the truth. He wants the truth. So do we."&lt;ref name="celizic"/&gt; Their lawyer called Daniel Schuler's position totally outrageous, an insult to the intelligence of the American public, and a [[hoax]].&lt;ref name="celizic"/&gt; Ruskin said on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in October 2009 that Daniel Schuler had avoided media appearances since ''Larry King Live'' out of respect to the Bastardi family.&lt;ref name="ali1028"/&gt;

In June 2010, the [[New York State Police]] issued its final report on the accident following eleven months of analysis. The report upheld the previous toxicology findings that Schuler was highly intoxicated and had high levels of THC in her system at the time of the accident.&lt;ref name="ferrete"&gt;Ferrete, Candice.

''The Journal News'' (Lower Hudson), 2010-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal action==
According to a Westchester County medical examiner, the crash was ruled a [[homicide]] soon after it occurred, because the victims were killed due to Schuler's negligent driving, regardless of toxicology findings.&lt;ref name="ferran0804"/&gt; On August 18, Westchester County [[District Attorney]] [[Janet DiFiore]] said that no charges would be filed in the incident, because Schuler was the only person responsible for the deaths. "Diane Schuler died in the crash and the charges died with her," DiFiore said.&lt;ref name="charges"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/08/18/national/main5250019.shtml?source=related_story "No Charges in Fatal Wrong-way Crash."] [[CBS News]], 2009-08-18.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, DiFiore faced accusations from Dan Schorr (a [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]] challenger for her office) that she had mishandled the Schuler case. An attorney for the Bastardi family also alleged that DiFiore had mishandled the case. Both parties said that DiFiore should have initiated a [[grand jury]] investigation into the incident. In response to Schorr's comments, DiFiore responded, "Is he suggesting that there was criminal evidence of a crime committed by someone and we wouldn't pursue it? That's just silly."&lt;ref&gt;Aiello, Tony.

''The Journal News'' (Lower Hudson), 2009-11-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastardi family said that if DiFiore did not convene a grand jury, they would seek support in the matter from the state attorney general and the governor.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Aman.

''The Journal News'' (Lower Hudson), 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a request from the Bastardi family that an administrator be appointed for Schuler's estate so that a lawsuit could be filed, Daniel Schuler officially declined the role in November 2009, leaving it to a county-court judge to appoint a public administrator.&lt;ref&gt;Amon, Michael.

''The Journal News'' (Lower Hudson), 2009-11-18.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 10, the Bastardi family filed suit against Diane Schuler and her brother, Warren Hance, seeking unspecified damages for wanton, willful, and reckless conduct. According to the family's lawyers, they were required by state law to include Hance in the suit because he was the owner of the van that Schuler was driving.&lt;ref&gt;Zraick, Karen.

In July 2011, Jackie Hance, who lost her three daughters in the accident, filed suit against her brother-in-law, Daniel Schuler.&lt;ref name=tarrytowndv &gt;{{cite web|last=Michelin|first=Robert|title=Mother of Girls in Taconic Accident Files Suit|url=http://tarrytown.dailyvoice.com/news/mother-girls-taconic-accident-files-suit|publisher=The Tarrytown Daily Voice|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit claims that the three deceased Hance girls suffered terror, fear of impending death, extreme horror, fright, and mental anguish.&lt;ref name=tarrytowndv/&gt; On July 26, 2011, the day after the premiere of HBO's ''[[There's Something Wrong with Aunt Diane]]'', and on the second anniversary of the crash, Daniel announced that he is suing the State of New York for not "keeping the road safe" and his brother-in-law Warren Hance for being the owner of the minivan that Diane was driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Michelin|first=Robert|title=Husband of Wrong Way Driver Sues State, In-Laws|url=http://briarcliff.dailyvoice.com/news/husband-wrong-way-driver-sues-state-laws|publisher=The Briarcliff Daily Voice}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2014, all lawsuits by all parties were either settled or dropped. The judge sealed all the settlements.

==Child Passenger Protection Act==
In August 2009, New York [[Governor of New York|Governor]] [[David Paterson]] proposed the [[Leandra's Law|Child Passenger Protection Act]], which would make it a [[felony]] to drive while intoxicated if a passenger under the age of 16 is in a vehicle.&lt;ref name="lysiak0814"/&gt; The proposal became known as [[Leandra's Law]], following the October 2009 death of 11-year-old Leandra Rosado, a passenger in a vehicle whose driver was drunk.&lt;ref&gt;Blain, Glenn. [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/10/31/2009-10-31_gop_senator_fuschillo_demands_action_on_leandras_law.html "GOP Senator Fuschillo Demands Action, Tougher Laws for Drunken Driving: 'Leandra's Law].'" New York Daily News, 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; The Child Passenger Protection Act was signed into New York law on November 18, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Cheryl. [http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/11/19/new.york.dwi.law/ "New York Toughens Drunken Driving Law]." CNN, 2009-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==
In September 2009, the syndicated talk show ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'' broadcast an episode about drunk-driving moms that focused heavily on Schuler and the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drphil.com/shows/show/1316|title=Dr. Phil.com  - Shows - Drunk Driving Moms|work=drphil.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, Oprah Winfrey devoted an episode of her show to the crash, interviewing Schuler's private investigator Tom Ruskin via [[Skype]], with Winfrey responding incredulously to several of his claims.&lt;ref name="ali1028"&gt;Ali, Aman. [http://www.lohud.com/article/2009910290398 "Victims' Families Angered by Schuler Claims]." ''The Journal News'' (Lower Hudson), 2009-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Emily.

''NBC New York'', 2009-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' episode "Doped," which first aired in November 2009, centers on a crash extremely similar to the Taconic Parkway incident. The fictionalized version features a woman who speeds down the [[West Side Highway]] in the wrong direction before crashing and killing herself, her daughter and her two nieces, and another family in another car.&lt;ref&gt;Melillo, Amanda.

''There's Something Wrong with Aunt Diane'', directed by [[Liz Garbus]] for [[HBO#Documentaries|HBO Documentaries]], establishes a timeline of events prior to the accident. The documentary suggests that Schuler could have been suffering from severe pain caused by a [[tooth abscess]] during the drive home, causing her to look for painkillers at the gas station and [[Self-medication|self-medicate]] with drugs and alcohol. The pain of the abscess, combined with vodka and marijuana, could have put her in a temporary state of [[delirium]] that triggered her fatal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;HBO, [http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/theres-something-wrong-with-aunt-diane/index.html#/documentaries/theres-something-wrong-with-aunt-diane/interview/liz-garbus.html ''There's something wrong with Aunt Diane'' - Interview with Liz Garbus]&lt;/ref&gt; In the documentary, Daniel Schuler and attorney Barbara claim they gave investigator Ruskin $30,000 to conduct an independent investigation and to re-test samples. Throughout the documentary, Jay Schuler, Diane Schuler's sister-in-law, and husband Daniel Schuler claim that Ruskin was not returning their phone calls for nine months. At the end of the documentary, Ruskin states that he had called her months ago with the results, and that she refused to pick up her phone. She is seen claiming that "she was told not to pick up" and "that she didn't understand any of it." Ruskin then informs her that his tests corroborated the previous tests; that Diane Schuler was highly intoxicated from alcohol and marijuana. Schuler's family persisted in refusing to accept the test results.

Jackie Hance wrote a book called ''I'll See You Again'' in which the tragedy is revisited, focusing on her initial grief and later reemergence into life.&lt;ref&gt;Time - Health &amp; Family, [http://healthland.time.com/2013/05/12/ill-see-you-again/ I'll see you again], Alexandra Sifferlin, May 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen King]]'s short story "[[Herman Wouk is Still Alive]]"  in ''Bazaar of Bad Dreams'' (2015) is, according to King, a fictional attempt to find answers to questions about what led to the crash and "perhaps to obtain some sort of closure."

==The Hance Family Foundation==
Jackie and Warren Hance formed a foundation, the Hance Family Foundation, whose main purpose is to honor the lives of their three daughters by ensuring healthy, happy, and safe children through innovative self-esteem educational programming. The foundation's central project is Beautiful Me, a self-esteem program designed to educate girls by promoting appreciation for their genuine qualities, accurate self-awareness, and the satisfaction of helping others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hancefamilyfoundation.org/|title=Home - Hance Family Foundation|work=Hance Family Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alan Jones''' "'''died of shame'''" '''controversy''' originated from a speech made by Australian radio broadcaster [[Alan Jones (radio broadcaster)|Alan Jones]] in September 2012, in which Jones suggested that then-Australian Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]]'s late father, John, "died of shame" over his daughter telling lies.

==Background==
On 23 September 2012, [[Sydney University Liberal Club]] hosted its annual president's dinner with a keynote address by Sydney radio presenter Alan Jones. In his address, Jones was cited as saying, in reference to Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]]'s recently deceased father, John Gillard, "The old man recently died a few weeks ago of shame. To think that he had a daughter who told lies every time she stood for parliament".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/julia-gillards-father-died-of-shame-alan-jones/story-e6frg6n6-1226484516814|title=Julia Gillard's father died of shame: Alan Jones|work=The Australian|date=28 September 2012|accessdate=2 October 2012|others = Audio recording}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Aston, Heath|url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/political-news/gillards-father-died-of-shame-alan-jones-20120929-26soa.html|title=Alan Jones says Julia Gillard's father died of shame|work=The Age|date=29 September 2012|accessdate=2 October 2012|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same event, the Club was auctioning a jacket made from [[chaff]] bags, autographed by Alan Jones, a reference to his previous comments on radio that Julia Gillard should be "put into a chaff bag and thrown into the sea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/jones-says-gillards-dad-died-of-shame/story-fncynkc6-1226484128451|title=Alan Jones apologises for speech that claimed PM's father 'died of shame'|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 September 2012|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this speech being made public by the media on 29 September 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Julia Gillard's father died of shame: Alan Jones|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/julia-gillards-father-died-of-shame-alan-jones/story-e6frg6n6-1226484516814|accessdate=7 April 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were calls for [[2GB]] to dismiss Jones. Jones' speech was secretly recorded by a [[News Limited]] journalist.&lt;ref name=privacy&gt;{{cite news|title=Journalist says no Jones privacy breach|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/journalist-says-no-jones-privacy-breach-20121001-26unk.html|accessdate=2 October 2012|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1 October 2012|agency=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the remarks were condemned across social media and the Australian media, Jones held a press conference and apologised. Jones also attempted to contact the Prime Minister to offer a personal apology, but was told she would not be returning his call. One academic linked the public reaction to the "bigger political and media context", citing the [[Leveson Inquiry]] in Britain, saying that it shows the "dark side of media power, including bullying by media owners and powerful media individuals who lobby politicians, demand favours, use their outlets as a bully pulpit and to seek revenge when they don't get their way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Sally|title=Shock for the shock jock|url=http://m.smh.com.au/opinion/shock-for-the-shock-jock-20121001-26vgp.html|accessdate=2 October 2012|newspaper=National Times|date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/alan-jones-apologises-to-prime-minister-julia-gillard-over-comments/story-fn59niix-1226484697310//Default.aspx|title=Alan Jones apologises to prime minister Julia Gillard over comments|date=29 September 2012|work=The Australian|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/private-dinner-with-alan-jones-was-open-to-anyone/story-fndo317g-1226484904859//Default.aspx|title='Private' dinner with Alan Jones was open to anyone|date=29 September 2012|work=Herald Sun|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/calls-mount-for-alan-jones-to-be-sacked-20121001-26ufs.html//Default.aspx |title=Calls mount for Alan Jones to be sacked |date=29 September 2012 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=1 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003235247/http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/calls-mount-for-alan-jones-to-be-sacked-20121001-26ufs.html |archivedate=3 October 2012 |df=dmy }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Following the controversy over the comments made by Jones, on 7 October his employer, [[Macquarie Radio Network]], announced that it would suspend all advertising on the Alan Jones breakfast show on 2GB to protect its advertisers from pressure being applied through social [[media activism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2GB drop all advertising on Jones Show|publisher=radiotoday.com.au|url=http://www.radiotoday.com.au/news/whats-new/1358-2gb-drop-all-advertising-on-jones-show.html|accessdate=7 October 2012|website=www.radiotoday.com.au|date=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones returned to the airwaves on 8 October 2012 without advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ad-free Alan Jones back on air|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2012/s3605648.htm|publisher=[[ABC Radio (Australia)|ABC Radio]]|location=Australia|work=[[AM (ABC Radio)|AM]]|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising resumed on the Jones' show on 16 October 2012 without many major advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Advertisers return today to Jones show|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/media/advertisers-return-today-to-jones-show/story-e6frg996-1226496677169|accessdate=7 April 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she would not comment on Jones's remarks, but instead thanked the Australian people for the "outpouring of support" that she and her family had received following the death of her father. When asked if she would appear on Jones's radio program she said, "No, I would not. I haven't spoken to Mr Jones and I don't intend to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/national/prime-minister-julia-gillard-addresses-community-cabinet-in-launceston/story-fndo1uez-1226487190369 |title=Prime Minister Julia Gillard won't comment on Alan Jones's comments during press conference in Launceston |work=The Courier-Mail |date=3 October 2012 |accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] described the comments as the "lowest of the low" and said he would be boycotting Jones's program.&lt;ref name="grtod"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-03/gillard-refuses-to-be-drawn-on-jones-controversy/4293014|title=Gillard refuses to be drawn on Jones controversy|author=Cullen, Simon|accessdate=8 October 2012|date=3 October 2012|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign Minister [[Bob Carr]] said Jones's comments were indecent and the public reaction was justifiable. Senator Carr further said "I cannot believe that it is helpful for a commercial enterprise to live with the brand 'hate radio'. And I just think the vehemence and the virulence of the message that comes out of the radio station is a very unhelpful thing for Australia.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jones comment indecent|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2012/s3603332.htm|work=[[Lateline]]|publisher=ABC TV|quote=''I think it was quite indecent and I think the public reaction is justifiable, but I think the point ought to be made: the people who cheered it are activists in the Liberal Party and the sort of people who'd be around Tony Abbott and his ministers were he to win the next election and the challenge is for Tony Abbott to tear up his links with such generators of hatred and virulence.''|date=3 October 2012 |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Backlash a warning for Alan Jones: Bob Carr|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/backlash-a-warning-for-jonescarr/story-fncynkc6-1226487770144|agency=AAP|date=4 October 2014|accessdate=|work=Herald Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition member [[Malcolm Turnbull]] said Jones's remarks were "cruel and offensive" and that "he should apologise to the PM and her family".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/jones-says-gillards-dad-died-of-shame/story-fncynjr2-1226484669276 |title=The PM's dad died of shame: Alan Jones under fire after cruel and offensive attack on Gillard |newspaper=news.com.au |date=30 September 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the power of the social media campaign that caused sponsors to act as "both inspiring and horrifying"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jones campaign 'inspiring, horrifying', says Malcolm Turnbull|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/jones-campaign-inspiring-horrifying-says-malcolm-turnbull/story-e6frfro0-1226494256334|accessdate=7 April 2013|newspaper=news.com.au|date=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said Jones has got "a dose of his own medicine". Turnbull further said that Jones had not been the victim of [[cyberbullying]] as Jones claimed but new media had allowed thousands of Australians to speak up "unedited and unmediated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=9 October 2012 |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1699741/Turnbull-Jones-gets-dose-of-own-medicine |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121230223201/http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1699741/Turnbull-Jones-gets-dose-of-own-medicine |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 December 2012 |title=Turnbull: Jones gets dose of own medicine |work=[[SBS News]] |location=Australia |accessdate=10 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 17 October, three regional radio stations, Albury based [[2AY]], Deniliquin based station [[2QN]] and Darwin's [[Territory FM]] had stopped broadcasting Jones' show.&lt;ref name="sdaj"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/sponsors-drop-alan-jones-after-attack-on-pm-20121001-26ugl.html|title=Sponsors drop Alan Jones after attack on PM|author1=Idato, Michael|author2=Quinn, Karl|accessdate=8 October 2012|date=1 October 2012|work=Brisbane Times|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2AY dumps Alan Jones|url=http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/369017/2ay-dumps-alan-jones/?cs=53|accessdate=7 April 2013|newspaper=The Border Mail|date=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top End radio station banishes Alan Jones show|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-17/territory-fm-banishes-alan-jones-radio-show/4318826|accessdate=7 April 2013|newspaper=ABC NEWS|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alan gets the boot - for good|url=http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2012/10/17/314399_entertainment.html|accessdate=7 April 2013|newspaper=[[NT News]]|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories''' (originally abbreviated '''AMGOT''', later '''AMG''') was the form of military rule administered by Allied forces during and after [[World War II]] within European territories they occupied.

== Notable AMGOT ==

This form of controlled government was implemented in the states of [[Germany]], [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,802871,00.html Friendly Isle], Time, July 26, 1943&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austria]] and [[Japan]], amongst others.

=== Opposition of France ===
[[Image:Billet drapeau de 100 francs recto.jpg|200px|thumb|A [[dollar]]-like 100-[[franc]] note produced by the Americans and supplied in June 1944 following [[Operation Overlord|Operation "Overlord"]].]]

US President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] insisted that an AMGOT should be implemented in France, but this was opposed by both [[Henry_L._Stimson|Henry Stimson]], the US Secretary of War, the [[John_J._McCloy|US Under-Secretary for War]], as well as Allied Europe Supreme Commander, General [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who had been strongly opposed to the imposition of AMGOT in North Africa. Eisenhower, unlike Roosevelt, wanted to cooperate with [[Charles de Gaulle]], and he secured a last-minute promise from Roosevelt on the eve of D-Day that the Allied officers would not act as military governors and would instead cooperate with the local authorities as the Allied forces liberated French territory{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}. De Gaulle would, however, later claim in his memoirs that he blocked AMGOT.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Munholland, Rock of Contention, Free French and Americans at War in New Caledonia 1940–1945, Berghahn Books, New York, Oxford, 2005, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AMGOT would have been implemented in France after its liberation if not for the Free French establishing control of the country per the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] in the name of the [[Free French Forces]] and the united [[French Resistance]] ([[French Forces of the Interior|FFI]]) following the [[liberation of Paris]] by the French themselves instead of the Allies, in August 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=QN9k6DW5uN0C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=henri+giraud+roosevelt&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2XXKVK3pF5XlauWngYAE&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=henri%20giraud%20roosevelt&amp;f=false Charles L. Robertson, "When Roosevelt Planned to Govern France"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
{{Main|Allied Control Council}}
Germany's control was notably divided amongst the powers of the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[France]].

===Italy===

====Sicily====
After [[Operation Husky]],  with the Allied Invasion of [[Sicily]] on July 10, 1943, the Allied Military Government was established with Staff Officer [[Francis Rodd, 2nd Baron Rennell]] and Civil Affairs officer  colonel [[Charles Poletti]], until February 1944.

==== Free Territory of Trieste ====

The Allied Military Government of Zone A of the [[Free Territory of Trieste]] was a follow-on from the military government of occupied Italy. It was established upon implementation of the [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|Treaty of Peace with Italy, 15 September 1947]], which created the free territory divided into two zones. Zone A was administered by the United States and the United Kingdom. Zone B was administered by Yugoslavia. Military government ended when the free territory was divided between Italy and Yugoslavia, November 1954, under the provisions of the [[London Memorandum]], a memorandum of understanding among the United States, United Kingdom, Italy and Yugoslavia.

[[Image:BoysAreStupid.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cover of the ''Boys are stupid...'' book]]
"'''Boys are stupid, throw rocks at them!'''" is a slogan on a [[T-shirt]] by [[Florida]] clothing company [[Todd Goldman|David and Goliath]] which in 2003 became the subject of a campaign by radio-host and [[Fathers' rights movement|fathers' rights activist]] Glenn Sacks on the grounds of [[misandry]] and the incitement of violence against children. This raised national attention and led to the removal of the shirts from several thousand retail outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = D | last = Crary | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001847133_stupidboys30.html | title = 'Stores pull "Boys Are Stupid" merchandise' | work = [[The Seattle Times]] | date = 2004-01-30 | accessdate = 2009-05-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090125143238/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001847133_stupidboys30.html | archivedate = 2009-01-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sacks' campaign was criticized as focusing on a trivial issue.

The publicity of the campaign increased sales of the shirt, which features the slogan printed next to a cartoon image of a boy running away from five stones flying in his direction, which was later used as the cover of a book which was also titled ''Boys are stupid, throw rocks at them!''.

==T-shirt==
The T-shirt was designed by company founder [[Todd Goldman]], who started David and Goliath in 1999 with "Boys are Smelly" T-shirts. It now features clothes with a variety of slogans, such as "Boys tell lies, poke them in the eyes!" or "The stupid factory, where boys are made". "Boys are stupid ..." has evolved into a successful object for merchandise, which includes all types of clothes, mugs, key chains, posters and other items. In 2005, Goldman published a book with the same title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Goldman, Todd |authorlink= Todd Goldman|title=Boys Are Stupid, Throw Rocks at Them! |publisher=Workman Publishing Company |location= |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-7611-3593-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
[[Los Angeles]] based radio host and [[Father's rights|father's rights activist]] Glenn Sacks initiated a campaign against the T-shirts in 2003. He claimed that they were part of a general societal mood that stigmatizes and victimizes boys.&lt;ref name="Final Update"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sacks |first=G |authorlink=Glenn Sacks |date=2004-03-04 |title=Final Update - Glenn Sacks campaign blog against "Boys are stupid..." |url=http://www.hisside.com/campaign_boys_are.htm |accessdate=2009-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727093706/http://hisside.com/campaign_boys_are.htm |archivedate=2009-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company says that the shirts are not meant to encourage violence.&lt;ref name=Binks&gt;{{cite news | first = G | last = Binks | title = The mean T-shirt: From the Stupid Factory | work = [[The National Post]] | date = 2004-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Goldman, the controversy boosted sales of the T-shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17161-2004Feb29.html|publisher=[[Reuters]], via [[The Washington Post]]|date=February 29, 2004|accessdate=2014-04-10|title=Anti-Boy T-Shirts Get Boost from Boycott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helen Grieco, executive director of the [[National Organization for Women]] stated "No, I don't think the shirts are cute.

Glenn Sacks responded to criticism of the campaign, asserting that the criticism was dismissive of the feelings of boys and that the idea that boys should laugh at the joke at their expense creates a "[[double bind]]" for boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = G | last = Sacks | url = http://www.glennsacks.com/why_i_launched.htm | title = Why I Launched the Campaign Against "Boys are Stupid" Products | work = [[Los Angeles Daily News]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040213094947/http://www.glennsacks.com/why_i_launched.htm|archivedate=13 February 2004| date = 2004-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2276">The '''''Caprotinia''''', or feasts of [[Juno (mythology)#Juno Caprotina|Juno Caprotina]], were ancient [[Roman festivals]] which were celebrated on July 7, in favour of the female slaves. During this solemnity they ran about, beating themselves with their fists and with rods. None but women assisted in the sacrifices offered at this feast.&lt;ref name="Festus1826"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sextus Pompeius Festus|title=M.

[[Plutarch]]'s ''Life of [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]]'' and ''Life of [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]]'' offer two possible origins for this feast, or the famous ''Nonae Caprotinae'' or ''[[Poplifugia|Poplifugium]]''. Firstly—and, in Plutarch's opinion, most likely—it commemorates the mysterious disappearance of [[Romulus]] during a violent thunderstorm that interrupted an assembly in the ''[[Palus Caprae]]'' ("Goats' Marsh"). Secondly, it commemorates a Roman victory by [[Marcus Furius Camillus#The Gauls and the Second Foundation of Rome|Camillus]] over the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]];  according to a minor tradition, a Roman serving maid or slave dressed as a noblewomen and surrendered herself to the Latins as hostage; that night, she climbed a wild [[ficus|fig-tree]] (''caprificus'', literally "goat-fig") and gave the Romans a torchlight signal to attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/camillus*.html Plutarch, The Parallel Lives, ''Life of Camillus'', 33; Loeb edition, 1914] (accessed 10 March 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

To '''counterfeit''' means to imitate something. Counterfeit products are fakes or unauthorized replicas of the real product. Counterfeit products are often produced with the intent to take advantage of the superior value of the imitated product. The word ''counterfeit'' frequently describes both the forgeries of [[currency]] and [[document]]s, as well as the imitations of items such as [[clothing]], [[handbags]], [[shoes]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, aviation and automobile parts, [[watch]]es, [[electronics]] (both parts and finished products), [[software]], works of [[art]], [[toys]], and [[movies]].&lt;ref&gt;"Physical Unclonable Functions in Theory and Practice", p. 46, by Christoph Böhm, Maximilian Hofer&lt;/ref&gt; 

Counterfeit products tend to have fake company [[logos]] and [[brands]] (resulting in [[patent infringement|patent]] or [[trademark infringement]] in the case of goods), have a reputation for being lower quality (sometimes not working at all) and may even include toxic elements such as lead. This has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, due to automobile and aviation accidents, poisoning, or ceasing to take essential compounds (e.g., in the case a person takes non-working medicine).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipcybercrime.com/counterfeit-culture/ Counterfeit culture documentary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[counterfeit money|counterfeiting of money]] is usually attacked aggressively by governments worldwide. Paper money is the most popular product counterfeited.

==Forgery of money or government bonds==
{{Main|Counterfeit money}}
Counterfeit money is currency that is produced without the legal sanction of the state or government and in deliberate violation of that country's laws.

The [[United States Secret Service]], mostly known for its guarding-of-officials task,  was initially organized primarily to combat the counterfeiting of American money. Counterfeit [[government bonds]] are public debt instruments that are produced without legal sanction, with the intention of "cashing them in" for authentic currency or using them as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] to secure legitimate loans or lines of credit.

==Counterfeiting of documents==
{{Main|Forgery}}

[[Forgery]] is the process of making or adapting documents with the intention to deceive.  It is a form of [[fraud]], and is often a key technique in the execution of [[identity theft]]. [[Uttering and publishing]] is a term in United States law for the forgery of non-official documents, such as a trucking company's time and weight logs.

[[Questioned document examination]] is a scientific process for investigating many aspects of various documents, and is often used to examine the provenance and verity of a suspected forgery. [[Security printing]] is a [[printing]] industry specialty, focused on creating legal documents which are difficult to forge.

==Counterfeiting of consumer goods==

The spread of counterfeit goods (commonly called "knock-offs" or "rip-offs") has become global in recent years and the range of goods subject to infringement has increased significantly. Apparel and accessories accounted for over 50 percent of the counterfeit goods seized by U.S Customs and Border Control. According to the study of Counterfeiting Intelligence Bureau (CIB) of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), counterfeit goods make up 5 to 7% of World Trade; however, these figures cannot be substantiated due to the secretive nature of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;ICC Counterfeiting Intelligence Bureau (1997), Countering Counterfeiting: A Guide to Protecting and Enforcing Intellectual Property Rights, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A report by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] indicates that up to US$200 Billion of international trade could have been in counterfeit and illegally copied goods in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/13/12/38707619.pdf | title= The Economic Effect of Counterfeiting and Piracy, Executive Summary | publisher = OECD, Paris | year = 2007 | accessdate=November 15, 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, the OECD updated these estimates, concluding that the share of counterfeit and illegitimate goods in world trade had increased from 1.85% in 2000 to 1.95% in 2007. That represents an increase to US$250 billion worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/57/27/44088872.pdf | title= Magnitude of counterfeiting and piracy of tangible products – November 2009 update | publisher = OECD, Paris | year = 2009 | accessdate=November 15, 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a detailed breakdown of the counterfeit goods industry, the total loss faced by countries around the world is $600 billion, with the United States facing the most economic impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.havocscope.com/activities/counterfeit-markets-by-countries/| title= Havocscope Counterfeit and Piracy Markets by Countries | accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When calculating counterfeit products, current estimates place the global losses at $400 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.havocscope.com/activities/counterfeit-and-piracy/| title= Havocscope Counterfeit and Piracy Markets by Products | accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 29, 2010, the [[Department of Homeland Security]] seized and shut down 82 websites as part of a U.S. crackdown of websites that sell counterfeit goods, and was timed to coincide with "Cyber Monday," the start of the holiday online shopping season.&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/11/us-website-takedowns/ "U.S. Shutters 82 Sites in Crackdown on Downloads, Counterfeit Goods"] ''Wired'' magazine, November 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Some see the rise in counterfeiting of goods as being related to [[globalisation]].  As more and more companies, in an effort to increase profits, move manufacturing to the cheaper labour markets of the third world, areas with weaker labour laws or environmental regulations, they give the means of production to foreign workers.  These new managers of production have little or no loyalty to the original corporation.  They see that profits are being made by the global brand for doing little (other than advertising) and see the possibilities of removing the middle men (i.e. the parent corporation) and marketing directly to the consumer. This can result in counterfeit products being virtually indistinguishable from original products, as they are being produced in the same company, and in damage to the parent corporation due to copyright infringement.&lt;ref name="SCHMIDLE"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22fake-t.html?scp=1&amp;sq=putian&amp;st=cse&amp;_r=0|title=Inside the Knockoff-Tennis-Shoe Factory|last=Schmidle|first=Nicholas|date=19 August 2010

Certain [[final good|consumer goods]], especially very expensive or desirable brands or those that are easy to reproduce cheaply, have become frequent and common targets of counterfeiting. The counterfeiters either attempt to deceive the consumer into thinking they are purchasing a legitimate item, or convince the consumer that they could deceive others with the imitation. An item which makes no attempt to deceive, such as a copy of a DVD with missing or different cover art or a book without a cover, is often called a "bootleg" or a "pirated copy" instead.

Counterfeiting has also been issued to "cash in" on the ever growing record collecting market. One major example is bootleggers have cloned copies of Elvis Presley's early singles for [[Sun Records]] since original copies starting changing hands amongst music fans for hundreds (and then, thousands) of [[US$]]. Some who produce these even do so with the wrong material. For example the song "Heartbreak Hotel" which was never released on Sun, as by the time Elvis' first heard it, prior to ever recording it, he had moved from Sun to [[RCA Victor]]. Rare releases by [[The Beatles]] such as their album with the [[butcher cover]], fan-club only released Christmas records and early demonstration discs issued by [[EMI]] are also examples of product reproduced by counterfeiters due to their high value to collectors.

Many counterfeit goods are produced and manufactured in China, making it the counterfeit capital of the world. In fact, the counterfeiting industry accounts for 8% of China's GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.asiabusinesscouncil.org/docs/IntellectualPropertyRights.pdf| title= Intellectual Property Rights | accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.mit.edu/cis/fpi_china.html| title= MIT CIS: Publications: Foreign Policy Index | accessdate = 15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counterfeit goods are produced and manufactured in Russia, North Korea, Taiwan, Bulgaria, and Greece as well. Greece is responsible for 2% of counterfeit goods seized by the EU. Some counterfeits are produced in the same factory that produces the original, authentic product, using inferior materials.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}  

Another trend in counterfeiting, especially seen in consumer electronics, is the manufacture of entirely new products using poor quality materials or, more often, incorporating desirable features not present in a brand's authentic product line and then including prominent and fake brand names and logotypes to profit from brand recognition or brand image. An example would be imitation "Nokia" and "iPhone" cellular phones with features like [[dual SIM]] slots or analog [[TV]], which are unavailable in authentic originals,&lt;ref name="shanzhaiji"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com.au/shanzhai-ji-all-you-need-to-know-about-fake-phones-339297258.htm|title=Shanzhai ji: All you need to know about fake phones - Mobile Phones|publisher=CNET|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CECT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/dual_sim-review-154p2.php|title=Dual SIM review: Mobiles go two-in-one - page 2|date=3 August 2007|work=GSM Arena|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or cosmetically-identical clones of high-end [[smartphone]]s such as those from [[Hong Kong]]-based [[Goophone]], using off the shelf [[system-on-chip]]s from [[MediaTek]]&lt;ref name="Fingas"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/08/05/goophone-lg-rolling-out-tri-sim-smartphones/|title=GooPhone and LG to offer first tri-SIM smartphones using MediaTek chips|last=Fingas|first=Jon|date=5 August 2013|work=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system, often with [[user interfaces]] made to resemble the devices they imitate.&lt;ref name="Esposito"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9to5google.com/2014/07/24/hands-on-with-a-functional-4-7-inch-iphone-6-clone-w-heavily-detailed-skinned-version-of-android-video/|title=Hands-on with a functional 4.7-inch iPhone 6 clone w/ heavily detailed, skinned version of Android (Video)|last=Esposito|first=Dom|date=24 July 2014|work=9to5Google|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example would be imitation [[S1 MP3 player|"iPod" MP3]] players whose batteries are removable and replaceable, whereas in authentic originals the batteries are permanently installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/au/pictures/fake-ipod-versus-the-real-thing/|title=Fake iPod versus the real thing|last=Chase|first=Brendon|author2=Derek Fung|date=8 October 2009|work=[[CNET]]|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Humphries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/apple/l-a-police-seize-10-million-worth-of-counterfeit-iphones-ipods-1311540/|title=L.A. police seize $10 million worth of counterfeit iPhones &amp; iPods|last=Humphries|first=Matthew|date=8 February 2011|work=[[Geek.com]]|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United States, a federal crackdown on counterfeit imports is driving an increase in domestic output of fake merchandise, according to investigators and industry executives. Raids carried out in New York City resulted in the seizure of an estimated $200 Million in counterfeit apparel, bearing the logos of brands such as "[[The North Face]]," "[[Ralph Lauren Polo|Polo]]," "[[Izod Lacoste]]," "[[Rocawear]]," "[[7 for All Mankind|Seven for all Mankind]]," and "[[FUBU|Fubu]]." One of the largest seizures was a joint operation in Arizona, Texas and California that seized seventy-seven containers of fake "[[Air Jordan|Nike Air Jordan]]" shoes and a container of "[[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]]" clothing, valued at $69.5 million. Another current method of attacking counterfeits is at the retail level. [[Fendi]] sued the [[Sam's Club]] division of [[Walmart]] for selling fake "Fendi" bags and leather goods in five states. Sam's Club agreed to pay Fendi a confidential amount to settle the dispute and dismiss the action. In the case ''[[Tiffany v. eBay]]'', [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]] sued auction site [[eBay]] for allowing the sale of counterfeit items, but lost on all claims.  [[Gucci]] filed suit against thirty websites in the United States and is currently{{when|date=December 2010}} in the process of suing one hundred more.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

A number of companies involved in the development of anti-counterfeiting and brand protection solutions have come together to form special industry-wide and global organisations dedicated to combating the so-called "brand pirates" such as the [[International Hologram Manufacturers Association]].  Other companies and organisations have established web-based communities that provide a framework for crowd-sourced solutions to counterfeiting.  One such free community, Collectors Proof&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.CollectorsProof.com |title=Collectors Proof |accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; enables manufacturers and users alike to associate unique identification numbers to virtually any item so that each new owner can update its chain of custody.  Because quality counterfeit items are often difficult to discern from authentic goods, this approach enables potential customers to access an item's current and previous owners{{snd}}its [[provenance]]{{snd}}prior to purchase.

To combat counterfeiting, companies may have the various parts of an item manufactured in independent factories and then limit the supply of certain distinguishing parts to the factory that performs the final assembly to the exact number required for the number of items to be assembled (or as near to that number as is practicable) or may require the factory to account for every part used and to return any unused, faulty or damaged parts. To help distinguish the originals from the counterfeits, the copyright holder may also employ the use of serial numbers or holograms etc., which may be attached to the product in another factory still.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

== Counterfeit Culture ==
Counterfeit culture is the thriving markets surrounding fake [[streetwear]]. Most commonly, these markets originate out of areas where the inability to buy popular streetwear brands has fueled more sophisticated markets for counterfeit goods. These markets have spawned the emergence of a tribe of widely available [[wikt:copycat|copycat]] brands.

In countries like [[South Korea]] and [[Russia]] where trade sanctions have been imposed historically to monitor and prevent the circulation of popular brands have instead created a demand for readily available counterfeit alternatives. The economic standing of a country or region also contributed to the demand for these products as the average consumer can’t afford [[luxury goods|luxury]] prices but will gain the same social impact purchasing a [[Counterfeit consumer goods|knock-off]] that’s of almost indistinguishable quality to the original product. 

Streetwear is out of reach for many people, not just because of international sanctions and low wages, but because exclusivity is built into it business model. Social and cultural forces are driving the unique fashion scene. In particular, social media has a huge influence on over these markets giving people images of things they can’t own and further fueling the desire to obtains certain “[[wikt:hype|hype]]d” items by any means accessible.

Designers have even begun to acknowledge the [[Fashion trend|trend]] of counterfeit culture by referencing fake or knock-off goods in their designs. This brought counterfeit culture into the realm of [[mainstream culture]] and has essentially shifted global acceptance towards becoming more lenient of these products as an appropriate alternative.

'''"Delta Dawn"''' and '''"Baby Jane"''' are the names given to an [[unidentified decedent|unidentified]] [[child murder]] victim whose body was found in [[Moss Point, Mississippi]] in December 1982. In a suspected [[filicide]], the child — aged approximately 18 months — was partially [[Asphyxia#Smothering|smothered]] before her body was thrown from the eastbound [[Interstate 10]] bridge into the [[Escatawpa River]], where she ultimately [[Drowning|drowned]].&lt;ref name=child&gt;{{cite news|last1=Broadus |first1=Don |title=Child's Body Found |work=The Mississippi Press |url=https://scontent-a-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10289856_881640768536708_8152629460266945921_n.jpg?oh=d0889e908d8cf47d360722513da10e92&amp;oe=5502E6CF |accessdate=December 14, 2014 |date=December 5, 1998 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was recovered between 36 and 48 hours after her death.&lt;ref name="ID"&gt;{{cite news|title=Search for Baby Jane's ID Continues|work=The Clarion-Ledger|date=20 December 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This unidentified decedent became known as both '''"Delta Dawn"''' and '''"Baby Jane"''' due to her gender, her age, and the fact her body was discovered at daybreak close to a [[river delta|delta]] of the Escatawpa River.

==Interstate 10 bridge==
According to numerous [[witness]]es, in the early hours of December 3, 1982&lt;ref name=ncmec/&gt; a female toddler was seen in the area of Moss Point, Mississippi, in the company of a young adult female presumed to have been her mother and who had been carrying this toddler in her arms. These sightings had occurred on both [[Mississippi State Highway 63]] and, later, the National Interstate 10, close to the state border of [[Alabama]].&lt;ref name="mother"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Broadus|first1=Don|title=Mother of Baby Believed in River|accessdate=25 March 2016|work=The Mississippi Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="officials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="drag" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ncmec/&gt; The woman carrying this child in her arms had been wearing a blue plaid shirt and blue jeans, and was last seen walking west along [[Interstate 10]], close to the [[truck scale]]s at the Alabama-Mississippi border sometime between midnight and one o'clock in the morning of December 3. Reportedly, this woman had been in an acute state of [[Distress (medicine)|distress]], but had ardently refused any offers of help from passing vehicles. These [[eyewitness memory|eyewitness reports]] subsequently given to investigators would further be [[Corroborating evidence|corroborated]] by accounts from a woman who had been monitoring [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]] conversations between truck drivers early in the morning of December 3, and who stated to investigators numerous truck drivers had been raising what she termed a "boatload of Hell" regarding an obviously distressed woman walking along Interstate 10 with a barefoot, coatless female toddler in her arms and who had repeatedly refused any offers of assistance from passing vehicles.&lt;ref name=doe/&gt;&lt;ref name=lingers/&gt; It is believed that the toddler in this woman's company may have been the victim subsequently recovered from the river.&lt;ref name=ncmec/&gt;

===Discovery===
Within two days of these sightings, at approximately 7:00 a.m. on December 5, a truck driver called police to report having sighted the body of an adult female floating face-down close to a bridge spanning the Escatawpa River along Interstate 10. The woman had been clothed in a blue plaid shirt. This truck driver immediately reported his discovery to the [[Jackson County Sheriff's Office (Mississippi)|Jackson County Sheriff's Office]],&lt;ref name="child" /&gt;&lt;ref name="search"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Broadus|first1=Don|title=Officials Search for Missing Mother|work=The Mississippi Press|date=December 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a sheriff's deputy immediately responded to the scene of the truck driver's sighting; finding no body floating in the general area of the river in which the body had been sighted, this deputy decided to continue the search, expanding the geographical search radius of the river as he did so. Shortly thereafter, he discovered the body of a small blonde haired child lying partially submerged and face up in the weeds close to the bridge.&lt;ref name=doe/&gt;&lt;ref name=namus/&gt; Authorities quickly determined the child had been thrown from the bridge into the general area where her body was subsequently found, and that this child's body was unlikely to have been that sighted by the truck driver, as the section of the Escatawpa River where her body was discovered had been heavily infested with weeds, thus making a sighting of any body in this section of the water very difficult for passing motorists.&lt;ref name="search" /&gt;&lt;ref name="officials" /&gt;

===Subsequent search===
Following the discovery of the child's body, the general vicinity of the Escatawpa River where the truck driver had sighted the body of the adult female was [[Dredging|dragged]] in the hopes of also retrieving her body, although these efforts would prove unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="drag"&gt;{{cite news|title=River Dragging Begins for Body|work=The Mississippi Press|date=December 1982|pages=1, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These searches were conducted with the aid of helicopters and boats, although the body of the woman initially sighted within the Escatawpa River has never been found.{{refn|group=n|The body of the adult female sighted by this truck driver is presumed to be that of the adult woman seen clutching the toddler in the early hours of December 3&lt;ref name=doe/&gt;&lt;ref name="funeral" /&gt;}} However, if the body seen floating in the river on December 5 was not hers, she has never been located alive, or presented herself to authorities.&lt;ref name=ncmec/&gt;&lt;ref name=still&gt;{{cite news|title=Unidentified Baby Still Remembered After 25 Years|url=http://www.wlox.com/Global/story.asp?S=7467928|accessdate=August 16, 2014|agency=WLOX13|publisher=WorldNow|date=December 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Authorities would later speculate the most likely scenario regarding these events was that the woman had attempted to [[Asphyxia#Smothering|smother]] the child, whom she had then thown into the water before then jumping to her death herself}} 

Although the [[Underwater search and recovery|underwater search unit]] failed to locate the body of the adult woman,&lt;ref name="officials"&gt;{{cite news|title=Officials search for body in the river|work=The Clarion-Ledger|date=8 December 1982|page=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt; this search unit did locate the largely [[Skeletonization|skeletal]] remains of an [[African Americans|African-American]] male on December 8. This individual is believed to have been aged 18 to 22, and his body was located beneath the eastbound I-10 bridge approximately 60 [[yard]]s from the scene of the earlier discovery of the child's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coast Divers Continue to Search|work=The Clarion-Ledger|date=12 December 1982|page=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/2408umms.html | title=Case File: 2408UMMS | work=[[The Doe Network]] | date=11 October 2014 | accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decedent also remains unidentified, and although investigators believe this individual had also been thrown over the I-10 bridge, this decedent had lain undiscovered for a minimum of six months, thus making his death extremely unlikely to be connected to the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1219914/1/screen | title=John Doe 1982 | work=[[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] | accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical examination==
An [[autopsy]] performed on the child's body revealed that someone had attempted to smother her before she had entered the river, although the child had still been alive when she had entered the water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unidentified Baby Still Remembered After 25 Years|url=http://www.wlox.com/Global/story.asp?S=7467928|accessdate=February 5, 2018|agency=WLOX13|publisher=WorldNow|date=December 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; having inhaled murky water from the river into her lungs, thus indicating she had ultimately died of drowning.&lt;ref name=doe&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 45UFMS|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/45ufms.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official [[cause of death]] would be certified as drowning due to her having inhaled water upon impacting the surface of the river.&lt;ref name=lingers/&gt; Investigators would also conclude she had been intentionally deposited into the river from the eastbound I-10 bridge, very likely having been thrown into the river by the woman seen carrying her two days prior to her discovery (with this woman possibly believing the child had died via the act of smothering).&lt;ref name="ID" /&gt; 

In life, Delta Dawn had been a healthy toddler, with her age estimated to have been between the ages of one and two years old, most likely being between 18 months and two years of age.&lt;ref name="child" /&gt; Twelve of her [[deciduous teeth|milk teeth]] had [[Tooth eruption|erupted]] at the time of her death, which influenced this age estimation. The girl was [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]], with curly strawberry-blond hair,&lt;ref name=ncmec/&gt; and has been described as being markedly beautiful in appearance.&lt;ref name=lingers/&gt; Because the child's body had lain in the river for approximately 36 to 48 hours prior to her discovery, her eyes had clouded to such a degree that determining their precise color was very difficult, although it is believed they had been either blue or brown.&lt;ref name=ncmec/&gt;&lt;ref name=doe/&gt; Despite the elemental damage to the eyes, her face was described as being in a "recognizable" condition.&lt;ref name=namus/&gt; She was around two feet six inches in height, weighed around 25 pounds and although no food was found in her stomach, she showed no signs of having been [[Malnutrition|malnourished]].&lt;ref name="search" /&gt;&lt;ref name=namus&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Report - NamUs UP # 12191|url=https://identifyus.org/en/cases/full_report/12191|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=August 16, 2014|date=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girl wore a pink and white Cradle Togs checkered dress, decorated with three flowers on its front, along with a diaper.&lt;ref name=ncmec&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1982|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1103997/1#poster|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]|accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lingers/&gt;&lt;ref name="child" /&gt;

===Funeral===
The funeral of this unidentified child (who would become known as both "Delta Dawn" and "Baby Jane" to both the public and the media) was primarily funded by a local deputy named Virgil Moore who, along with his wife, Mary Ann, initiated a fundraising and donations appeal via local businesses and funeral homes to ensure the child received a [[Christian burial|Christian funeral]], with the wife of Deputy Moore being the individual who subsequently coined the one of the two names by which the child is now colloquially known, having been aghast at the thought of the child being simply buried as a Jane Doe.&lt;ref name=lingers&gt;{{cite news|title=Mystery of lost child lingers: Baby Jane would be 25|work=The Sun Herald|date=December 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Mary Ann Moore would name the still-unidentified child "Baby Jane"—the name currently inscribed upon the child's granite grave marker within the Jackson County Cemetery&lt;ref name=lingers&gt;{{cite news|title=Mystery of lost child lingers: Baby Jane would be 25|work=The Sun Herald|date=December 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Delta Dawn was laid to rest in the Jackson County Cemetery following an hourlong service conducted at the Bethel Assembly Church in [[Pascagoula]]. This service was conducted within weeks of the child's discovery, after all efforts to locate any relatives had proven fruitless. The service itself was attended by approximately 200 people, with four police officers serving as [[pallbearer]]s. The primary means of paying for and conducting the child's funeral were donations by various local businesses and their employees,&lt;ref name="funeral"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Broadus|first1=Don|work=The Mississippi Press|title=Funeral Service for Baby Jane|date=December 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Delta Dawn was buried beneath a flat granite marker with a ceramic vase. Her grave bears the inscriptions "Baby Jane" and "Known only to God".

On the 25th anniversary of the funeral of Delta Dawn, a memorial service in her honor was held at the Bethel Assembly Church.&lt;ref name=still/&gt; This memorial service was organized by two Alabama women named Marjorie Brinker and Lynn Reuss, who have both stated they cannot comprehend "why someone would throw a baby into the river like that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=25 Years Later, 'Baby Jane' Still a Mystery |date=December 7, 2007 |url=http://m.picayuneitem.com/2007/12/25-years-later-baby-jane-still-a-mystery/ |publisher=Picayune Item |accessdate=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and ongoing investigations==
Extensive searches have been conducted to find the body of the woman seen floating face-down within the Escatawpa River on December 5; equal efforts have been made to locate and/or identify the acutely distressed woman seen walking along Interstate 10 carrying a barefooted child in her arms on December 3, should the body sighted by the truck driver actually not have been hers. All efforts have proven fruitless. Several scenarios surrounding the death of Delta Dawn have been theorized, with the most common assertion being that the woman seen with the toddler was the child's mother, who had either accidentally or intentionally caused the child's death before subsequently committing [[suicide]].

Following the discovery of Delta Dawn's body, newspapers throughout the country published stories of the discovery of the child's body, and the sightings on Interstate 10 two days previously. These stories often featured contemporary [[forensic facial reconstruction]]s of the how the child had most likely appeared in life. All initial efforts proved unsuccessful with ascertaining the identity of Delta Dawn via this technique.&lt;ref name="ID" /&gt; A contemporary report of a woman who informed sheriff's deputies that she had "given away" her child to a group of men was originally connected to the case by the investigating officers, although these investigators rapidly determined that the subject requesting assistance had a male child, thus enabling investigators to quickly determine this report as being impertinent to this case.&lt;ref name=lingers/&gt;

In 2009, the body of Delta Dawn was [[Burial#Exhumation|exhumed]] in order that investigators could obtain a [[Genetic testing|DNA sample]] from her body which could be entered into both the [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] and the [[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] databases for comparison with nationwide unsolved murders and [[missing person]] reports. To date, no DNA match with Delta Dawn or the individual believed to have been her mother (should the two have been related) has been obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emerald.tufts.edu/alumni/magazine/summer2014/features/singing-river.html|title=The Bodies in Singing River: On The Trail of a Cold, Cold Case|first=Deborah|last=Halber|date=1 July 2014|publisher=|via=tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With advances in technology, in the years since the discovery of Delta Dawn's body, the child has undergone several forensic facial reconstructions in ongoing efforts to identify her body. The National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children has also released two illustrations depicting potential likenesses as to how Delta Dawn may have physically appeared in life; other [[forensic arts|forensic artists]] have also produced their own renderings in an effort to discover her identity.&lt;ref name=ncmec/&gt;&lt;ref name=doe/&gt;

The U.S. leg of the tour grossed approximately $70.8 million according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine and was the highest-grossing tour for either a [[pop music|pop]] or R&amp;B band since [[TLC (band)|TLC's]] [[FanMail Tour]], where Destiny's Child performed as an opening act in 1999.

==History==
The tour kicked off in [[Hiroshima]], Japan on April 9, 2005 and ended [[Vancouver]], Canada on September 10.

Destiny's Child embarked on the world tour sponsored by [[McDonald's Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Destiny's Child Debuts World Children's Day(TM) at McDonald's(R) Anthem |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/destinys-child-debuts-world-childrens-daytm-at-mcdonaldsr-anthem-55593902.html |location=Los Angeles |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |date=November 15, 2005 |accessdate=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and performed hits such as "[[No, No, No (Destiny's Child song)|No, No, No]]", "[[Survivor (Destiny's Child song)|Survivor]]", "[[Say My Name]]", "[[Independent Women]]" and "[[Lose My Breath]]".  In addition to renditions of the group's recorded material, they also performed songs from each singer's solo careers, most notably numbers from [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]]'s debut album, ''[[Dangerously in Love]]''.  The stage design afforded 360 degree viewing within the typical [[arena]] show venue.  Several interludes by the show's dancers allowed for the expected costume changes; those costumes, often glittering gowns, were designed by Tina Knowles, Beyoncé's mother, and manufactured by [[House of Deréon]]. A special set of outfits were designed as a tribute to the Broadway musical [[Dreamgirls (musical)|Dreamgirls]], hinting at the play's "One Night Only (Disco)" scene where [[Deena Jones &amp; the Dreams]] wear the same color pants suits.

===Split-up announcement===
During the last stop of their European tour in [[Barcelona]] on June 11, 2005, [[Kelly Rowland]] suddenly announced: "This is the last time you would see us on stage as Destiny's Child".&lt;ref name="quote"/&gt;

{{cquote|We have been working together as Destiny's Child since we were 9, and touring together since we were 14. After a lot of discussion and some deep soul searching, we realized that our current tour has given us the opportunity to leave Destiny's Child on a high note, united in our friendship and filled with an overwhelming gratitude for our music, our fans, and each other. After all these wonderful years working together, we realized that now is the time to pursue our personal goals and solo efforts in earnest. ... No matter what happens, we will always love each other as friends and sisters and will always support each other as artists. We want to thank all of our fans for their incredible love and support and hope to see you all again as we continue fulfilling our destinies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1071405,00.html |title=Destiny's Child to Split Up After Tour |last1=Silverman |first1=Stephen |last2= |first2= |date=June 13, 2005 |website=[[People (magazine)|People]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |accessdate=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The announcement was surprising to many, as the trio had downplayed rumors of a split in the wake of Knowles' success, although prior plans had called for the members to focus on solo projects at the end of the tour.

==Broadcasts and recordings==
A performance from the tour was filmed in [[Atlanta]] at [[Philips Arena]] on July 15, 2005, and the resulting DVD ''[[Destiny's Child Live in Atlanta]]'' was released on March 28, 2006. [[RIAA]] subsequently certified the DVD as Platinum. The concert was also aired in the USA on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] as a television special, on Channel 4 in the UK and on the Dutch television channel [[AT5]].

'''Drotrecogin alfa (activated)''' ('''Xigris''', marketed by [[Eli Lilly and Company]]) is a [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] form of human activated [[protein C]] that has [[thrombosis|anti-thrombotic]], [[anti-inflammatory]], and profibrinolytic properties. Drotrecogin alpha (activated) belongs to the class of [[serine protease]]s. Drotrecogin alfa has not been found to improve outcomes in people with severe sepsis. The manufacturer's aggressive strategies in marketing its use in severe sepsis have been criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/11/02/lillys-shocker-or-the-post-marketing-blues|title=Lilly’s Shocker, or the Post-Marketing Blues|publisher=Scientific American|work=guest blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 25, 2011, Eli Lilly &amp; Co. withdrew Xigris from the market after a major study showed no efficacy for the treatment of [[sepsis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Xigris (drotrecogin alfa (activated)) to be withdrawn due to lack of efficacy| work = Press release| publisher = European Medicines Agency| location = London, UK| url = http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages%2Fnews_and_events%2Fnews%2F2011%2F10%2Fnews_detail_001373.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c1| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/62icYBgm1?url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl%3Dpages/news_and_events/news/2011/10/news_detail_001373.jsp%26mid%3DWC0b01ac058004d5c1| archivedate = 26 October 2011| date = 25 October 2011| accessdate = 26 October 2011| deadurl = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-25/lilly-pulls-xigris-off-markets-after-sepsis-drug-fails-study.html |title=Lilly Pulls Xigris Off Markets After Sepsis Drug Fails Study |date=October 25, 2011 |first=Drew |last=Armstrong |newspaper=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029155823/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-25/lilly-pulls-xigris-off-markets-after-sepsis-drug-fails-study.html |archive-date=October 29, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==
Drotrecogin alfa does not improve mortality in severe [[sepsis]] or septic shock but does increase bleeding risks. Therefore, a 2011 [[Cochrane review]] recommended that clinicians and policymakers not recommend its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martí-Carvajal|first=AJ|author2=Solà, I |author3=Lathyris, D |author4=Cardona, AF |title=Human recombinant activated protein C for severe sepsis|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Apr 13, 2011|issue=4|pages=CD004388|pmid=21491390|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004388.pub4|editor1-last=Martí-Carvajal|editor1-first=Arturo J}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22419295|date = July 2018}}

==Risks and contraindications==

===Contraindications===
The following patients should not receive drotrecogin:
* Active internal bleeding 
* Recent (within 3 months) hemorrhagic stroke 
* Recent (within 2 months) intracranial/intraspinal surgery/severe head trauma 
* Trauma patients with an increased risk of life-threatening bleeding 
* Presence of an epidural catheter 
* Known or suspected intracranial neoplasm or mass lesion 
* Known hypersensitivity to drotrecogin or any component

===Precautions===
The following patients are at an increased risk for bleeding complications due to drotrecogin-alpha therapy, and a careful risk/benefit assessment should be made prior to initiating therapy.
* Therapeutic Heparin (&gt;15 units/kg/h) 
* Platelet count &lt;30,000/mm3 
* Recent (within 6 weeks) gastrointestinal bleeding 
* Recent administration (within 3 days) of thrombolytic therapy 
* Recent administration (within 7 days) of oral anticoagulants or GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors 
* Recent administration (within 7 days) of &gt;650&amp;nbsp;mg/day of aspirin or other platelet inhibitors 
* Recent (within 3 months) ischemic stroke 
* Known or suspected intracranial AV malformation or aneurysm 
* Known bleeding diathesis (e.g., hemophilia) except for acute coagulopathy related to sepsis 
* Chronic severe hepatic disease 
* HIV infection in association with a last known CD4 count of &lt;50/mm3 
* Any other condition in which bleeding constitutes a significant hazard or would be particularly difficult to manage because of its location 
* Because drotrecogin-alpha is a therapeutic protein, there exists a potential for immunogenicity. Antibodies against drotrecogin have been observed. There is insufficient data at this time to quantify the risk, but extreme caution should be exercised if a patient has previously received drotrecogin-alpha.

===Side-effects===
Although patients at high risk of bleeding were excluded from the phase III clinical study (PROWESS), 25% of patients treated with drotrecogin and 18% of those receiving placebo experienced at least one bleeding event (principally ecchymoses or GI bleeding) during the 28-day study period. During treatment serious bleeding events (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage, any life-threatening bleeding event, any bleeding event requiring administration of at least 3 units of packed red blood cells daily for 2 consecutive days) occurred in 2.4% of patients treated with drotrecogin and in 1% of those receiving placebo. No significant differences between geriatric patients and younger patients regarding bleeding events in the drotrecogin group have been found.

No other side-effects have been observed so far.

In the meantime a second study encompassing approximately 2,000 adult patients has been completed and the results showed a comparable side-effect profile.

===Interactions===
Drug interactions with drotrecogin have not been systematically studied in patients with severe sepsis. Caution should be exercised when using other drugs that affect hemostasis concomitantly with drotrecogin (e.g. [[aspirin]], [[warfarin]], [[clopidogrel]]). However, the use of low dose prophylactic Heparin did not affect safety when given concurrently with drotrecogin.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
The specific mechanisms by which drotrecogin exerts its effect on survival in patients with severe sepsis is not completely understood. In vitro data suggest that activated protein C exerts an antithrombotic effect by inhibiting factors Va and VIIIa, and that it has indirect profibrinolytic activity by inhibiting [[plasminogen activator inhibitor-1]] (PAI-1). In vitro data also suggest that activated protein C may exert an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting [[Tumor necrosis factors|tumor necrosis factor]] production, by blocking [[leukocyte]] adhesion to [[selectin]]s, and by limiting the thrombin-induced inflammatory responses within the microvascular endothelium.{{Nurse's Drug Handbook - Jones and Bartlett Learning |date=February 2012}}

===Pharmacokinetics===
If the dosage guidelines are followed, the drug reaches peak plasma levels after two hours and is completely cleared from plasma two hours after termination of the infusion period. Endogenous plasma protease inhibitors deactivate drotrecogin. Therefore, no dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients, or in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction.

===Presentation===
Xigris is the current [[brand name]] of activated drotrecogin alfa, manufactured by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]]. The drug is sold in vials containing either 5&amp;nbsp;mg or 20&amp;nbsp;mg, respectively. The United States' [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved the drug in 2001 as was the case with the drug authorities in many other countries.

==Society and culture==

===Marketing controversy===

In 2001, Eli Lilly's chairman, president and CEO, Sidney Taurel, told shareholders: "No medicine better symbolizes our mission than Xigris," calling it "one of our industry's genuine breakthroughs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://lilly.com/investor/annual_report/lillyar2001editorial.pdf Eli Lilly Annual Report, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

Xigris was designed to fight sepsis, a condition that kills more than 200,000 Americans annually. It was the only approved drug for sepsis, and it costs $8,000 to treat a single patient. Lilly hoped it would be a blockbuster, with sales of at least a billion dollars a year. But after five years on the market, sales were only $200 million.

Eli Lilly used the Belsito &amp; Company PR firm in a marketing campaign to promote Xigris, its drug for treatment of sepsis. A report in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] (NEJM) accused the company of initiating false reports of a shortage of the drug to boost sales.&lt;ref name="pmid17050887"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eichacker PQ, Natanson C, Danner RL | title = Surviving sepsis--practice guidelines, marketing campaigns, and Eli Lilly | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 355 | issue = 16 | pages = 1640–2 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 17050887 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp068197 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Belsito and Company spread the word that the drug was being "rationed" and physicians were being 'systematically forced' to decide who would live and who would die. As part of this effort, Lilly provided a group of physicians and bioethicists with a $1.8 million grant to form the Values, Ethics, and Rationing in Critical Care (VERICC) Task Force, purportedly to address ethical issues raised by rationing in the intensive care unit. Finally, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign was established, in theory to raise awareness of severe sepsis and generate momentum toward the development of treatment guidelines.

This marketing campaign was especially troublesome because Xigris has been linked to increased risk of serious bleeding in patients who used it as well as other concerns. "Controversy surrounds both the drug study itself and the FDA approval," wrote NEJM editor-at-large Richard P. Wenzel, MD in 2002.&lt;ref name="urlMedscape.com Log In"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/442255 | title = Controversy Brews Over Xigris' Role in Treating Sepsis | author = Barclay L | date = 2002-10-01 | format = | work = Medscape Medical News | publisher = WebMD LLC | pages = | language = | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20021015023647/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/442255| archivedate =2002-10-15| quote = | dead-url = yes | accessdate = 2010-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FDA approved the drug despite the advisory committee's split vote (10 to 10) due to concerns about the validity of the claimed efficacy and safety findings on the basis of a single trial.

Eli Lilly spokeswoman Judy Kay Moore insisted that the company did not mastermind the ethics task force or steer the guideline-writing process. It was only a coincidence, Moore says, that the ethics task force and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign used the same P.R. firm, Belsito and Company.&lt;ref name="urlReport: Lilly Promoted Drug Under False Pretenses : NPR"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6298643 | title = Report: Lilly Promoted Drug Under False Pretenses | author = Knox R | date = 2006-10-18 | format = | work = All Things Considered | publisher = National Public  Radio | pages = | language = | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061019001123/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6298643| archivedate =2006-10-19| quote = | dead-url = yes | accessdate = 2010-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FDA approval===
In the USA drotrecogin was FDA approved for the reduction of mortality in adult patients with severe [[sepsis]] (sepsis associated with acute organ dysfunction) who have a high risk of death (as determined by [[APACHE II]] scores of 25 or greater).  Evidence however is not sufficiently strong for its use to become standard of care.&lt;ref name="pmid12324562"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Warren HS, Suffredini AF, Eichacker PQ, Munford RS | title = Risks and benefits of activated protein C treatment for severe sepsis |journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 347 | issue = 13 | pages = 1027–30 |date=September 2002 | pmid = 12324562 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMsb020574 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the risk of severe bleeding, associated with the use of Xigris, the following guidelines have been additionally proposed, but are not FDA requirements:
* Drotrecogin should only be ordered by a critical care specialist with experience weighing the risks and benefits of this medication.  
* Drotrecogin should only be administered in a critical care area such as an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), or other unit with very frequent observation and monitoring.

On October 25, 2011, Eli Lilly and Company announced a worldwide voluntary market withdrawal of Xigris [drotrecogin alfa (activated)]. In a recent study, Xigris failed to show a survival benefit for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm277114.htm |website=fda.gov |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |date=October 25, 2011 |access-date=May 24, 2017 |title=FDA Drug Safety Communication: Voluntary market withdrawal of Xigris [drotrecogin alfa (activated)] due to failure to show a survival benefit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The exact mechanism for this protein is currently not known, but efforts continue to isolate activated protein C mutants that lack anticoagulant properties for potential therapeutic use.&lt;ref name="Angus 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angus|first1=Derek C.|last2=van der Poll|first2=Tom|title=Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=29 August 2013|volume=369|issue=9|pages=840–851|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1208623|pmid=23984731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''E-Bow the Letter'''" is the first single from [[R.E.M.]]'s tenth studio album ''[[New Adventures in Hi-Fi]]''. It was released in August 1996 just weeks before the album's release. During the same month, R.E.M. signed its then record-breaking five-album contract with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Although it peaked at number four on the [[UK Singles Chart]], the highest any R.E.M. song charted in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] until "[[The Great Beyond]]" in 2000, the song fared less well in the [[United States]], reaching only number 49 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It became R.E.M.'s lowest charting lead single since "[[Fall on Me]]" released from ''[[Lifes Rich Pageant]]'' in 1986, when the band was on a smaller record label, [[I.R.S. Records]].

The song features American singer-songwriter and "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Godmother of Punk]]" [[Patti Smith]] performing backing vocals. Smith was cited as a major influence by band members Michael Stipe and Peter Buck and also provided backing vocals for "Blue" the closing track on the band's final studio album ''[[Collapse into Now]]''.

==History==
The song's title refers to the [[EBow]], an electromagnetic field-generating device that induces sustained vibration in an [[electric guitar]] string (creating a [[violin]]-like effect), and to a "letter never sent" by [[Michael Stipe]]. Guitarist [[Peter Buck]] can be seen using an EBow in the video for the song at approximately 1:27 to 1:30. [[R.E.M.]] has also played the song live with artists including [[Thom Yorke]] singing [[Patti Smith]]'s vocal part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/listen-to-rem-and-thom-yorkes-version-of-e-bow-the-letter/|title=Listen to R.E.M. and Thom Yorke’s Version of “E-Bow the Letter” {{!}} Pitchfork|last=Monroe|first=Jazz|date=27 September 2018|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song is about Stipe's friend, the actor and musician [[River Phoenix]].

"E-Bow the Letter" was ranked number 21 on ''[[NME]]'' magazine's list of the "Singles of the Year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acclaimedmusic.net/Current/S2117.htm |title=End of Year Lists |accessdate=2008-03-04 |publisher=[[Acclaimed Music]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the song was placed on R.E.M.'s compilation ''[[In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003]]''. [[Pitchfork Media]] founder and owner Ryan Schreiber described it on the website as "possibly one of the greatest songs ever written."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20001005074841/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/r/rem/new-adventures-in-hi-fi.shtml R.E.M.: New Adventures in Hi-Fi: Pitchfork Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electrolyte imbalance''' is an abnormality in the concentration of [[Electrolyte|electrolytes]] in the body. [[Electrolytes]] play a vital role in maintaining [[homeostasis]] within the body. They help to regulate heart and neurological function, [[fluid balance]], oxygen delivery, [[Acid–base homeostasis|acid–base balance]] and much more. Electrolyte imbalances can develop by the following mechanisms: excessive [[ingestion]]; diminished elimination of an electrolyte; diminished ingestion or excessive elimination of an electrolyte.

The most serious electrolyte disturbances involve abnormalities in the levels of [[sodium]], [[potassium]] or [[calcium]]. Other electrolyte imbalances are less common, and often occur in conjunction with major electrolyte changes.  Chronic [[laxative]] abuse or severe [[diarrhea]] or [[vomiting]] ([[gastroenteritis]]) can lead to electrolyte disturbances along with [[dehydration]]. People suffering from [[bulimia]] or [[anorexia nervosa]] are at especially high risk for an electrolyte imbalance.

==General function==
Electrolytes are important, because they are what cells (especially nerve, heart and muscle cells) use to maintain voltages across their cell membranes and to carry electrical impulses (nerve impulses, muscle contractions) across themselves and to other cells. [[Kidney]]s work to keep the electrolyte concentrations in blood constant despite changes in the body. For example, during heavy exercise, electrolytes are lost in sweat, particularly in the form of sodium and potassium. These electrolytes must be replaced to keep the electrolyte concentrations of the body fluids constant.

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 2013''' was the 58th edition of the annual [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It took place in [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]], following [[Loreen (singer)|Loreen]]'s win at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012 contest]] in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]] with the song "[[Euphoria (Loreen song)|Euphoria]]". It was the fifth time that Sweden had hosted the contest, the last time being in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]]. [[Sveriges Television]] (SVT) chose [[Malmö Arena]] as the venue following the consideration of several venues in Sweden. The host for the contest was [[Petra Mede]]. Thirty-nine countries participated, including [[Armenia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Armenia]], which was last represented in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]]. [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Eurovision Song Contest|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest|Portugal]], [[Slovakia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Slovakia]] and [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest|Turkey]] announced their withdrawal from the 2013 Contest.

The design of the contest was built around the theme "We Are One" – highlighting equality and unity of all the participating countries alongside the cultural diversity and influence of each participant. Compared to many of the previous contests in the history of Eurovision, rather than focusing on promoting its own country, Sweden chose to lay focus on the artists and their respective countries. The postcards presented before every song which have often been used to show the host country's nature, culture and social life, were changed to show the typical everyday life of each individual artist in their home countries scattered around Europe.

The [[Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013|winner for 2013 was Denmark]] with the song "[[Only Teardrops]]" sung by [[Emmelie de Forest]], which scored 281 points, beating Azerbaijan with a margin of 47 points. This makes it the second time that Denmark won on Swedish soil. Ukraine finished in third place and Norway in fourth, while Russia finished in fifth place. Out of the countries with the 'Big Five' status, only Italy managed to finish in the top ten, third in a row since its return, coming seventh with 126 points, exactly double of remaining ones' sum. [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest|The Netherlands]] finished ninth in their first participation in a final since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]]. 170 million viewers watched the semifinals and final of the 2013 edition. For the first time since [[ESC 1985|1985]], no country of the former [[Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Yugoslav federation]] participated in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest.

This year was the first time adult Eurovision displayed the "Parade of Nations", which already existed in [[Junior Eurovision]] since 2004, an idea introduced by Sweden to become a new Eurovision tradition. The concept sees all countries performing in the Grand Final present themselves with their national flags before the contest begins. This year, the contestants entered the main stage by walking across a bridge over the audience. The idea was continued the following years by Denmark and Austria, the hosts of Eurovision 2014 and 2015 respectively.

On 8 July 2012, the Swedish broadcaster [[Sveriges Television]] (SVT) announced that [[Malmö Arena]] in [[Malmö]] would be the host venue for the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest. This was the fifth time after [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1992|1992]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]] that the competition was held in Sweden and the second time, after 1992, that it was held in Malmö. SVT had expressed the desire to host the contest at a slightly smaller venue than previous years, as well as smaller environment which is easier to dedicate and decorate for other celebrations and festivities of the event within the host city. This were factors in the choice of [[Malmö Arena]] as the host venue,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/eurovision-song-contest-2013-halls-i-malmo|title=Eurovision Song Contest 2013 hålls i Malmö – Melodifestivalen|last=Dahlander|first=Gustav|date=8 July 2012|work=[[Sveriges Television]] (SVT)|language=Swedish|trans-title=Eurovision Song Contest 2013 will be held in Malmö, Sweden|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Malmö as Sweden's [[urban areas in Sweden|third-largest city]] by population after [[Stockholm]] and [[Gothenburg]], the two other initial location-bidders.

SVT made the advance decision to allocate Denmark at one semi-final and Norway at the other, in consideration for the number of Danish and Norwegian fans likely to come, with the arena being relatively small and so not suitable for accommodating both countries' fans at one semi-final event. Øresund bridge was eventually also used as the main artistic medium for the theme of the contest, as an expression of binding cultures.

On the night of the final for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012 Contest]], the chief executive of [[SVT]], [[Eva Hamilton]], stated to the Swedish media that various venues in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö were being considered for hosting the 2013 Contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/noje/svt-redan-forberedda-pa-schlager-em-2013/|title=SVT redan förberedda på schlager-EM 2013|author= TT Spectra|date=27 May 2012|work=Expressen|language=Swedish|trans-title=SVT already prepared for Eurovision 2013|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One alternative put forward in the ''[[Expressen]]'', was to hold the competition at three different venues – the semi-finals in Gothenburg and Malmö, and the final in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurovisiontimes.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/eurovision-2013-split-over-three-cities/|title=Eurovision 2013: Split Over Three Cities?|author=Hulluna|date=5 June 2012|work=eurovisiontimes|accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was dismissed as unfeasible by SVT, which declared that the contest would be hosted in only one city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://escxtra.com/2012/06/bjorkman-ends-speculation-on-three-host-cities-for-2013/ |title=General: Björkman ends speculation on three host cities for 2013 |last=Wilson |first=Ryan |date=18 June 2012 |publisher=escXtra.com |accessdate=18 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621223545/http://escxtra.com/2012/06/bjorkman-ends-speculation-on-three-host-cities-for-2013/ |archivedate=21 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June 2012, it was announced that Gothenburg had withdrawn from the bidding process due to the city being the host of the [[Göteborg Horse Show]] in late April 2013. There were also concerns about the availability of hotel rooms due to a variety of other events taking place in the same time frame as the Eurovision Song Contest.&lt;ref name="Gothenburg withdrawal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/kultur-och-nojen/inget-schlager-em-i-goteborg |title=Inget schlager-EM i Göteborg |author=TT Spectra |date=20 June 2012 |work=Sydsvenskan |language=Swedish |trans-title=No Eurovision Song Contest in Gothenburg |accessdate=20 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622005446/http://www.sydsvenskan.se/kultur-och-nojen/inget-schlager-em-i-goteborg |archivedate=22 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The executive producer for the 2013 Contest, Martin Österdahl, told Swedish press that he did not like the decisions made by previous hosts to hold the contest in larger arenas, stating that he and SVT wanted the 2013 Contest to be "more close and personal".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SVT.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/malmo|title=Därför fick Malmö Eurovision – Melodifestivalen|last=Dahlander|first=Gustav|date=9 July 2012|work=[[Sveriges Television]] (SVT)|language=Swedish|trans-title=Therefore Malmö received Eurovision Song Contest|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; SVT also claimed that the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) wanted the 2013 Contest to be "smaller" due to the escalating costs of previous contests.&lt;ref name="SVT.se"/&gt;

[[Malmö Arena]] is [[Sweden]]'s fourth-largest indoor arena, after [[Friends Arena]], [[Tele2 Arena]] and [[Ericsson Globe]], all located in [[Stockholm]].

The combination of televoting and jury voting results underwent changes that were detailed in the official rules for the 2013 contest.&lt;ref name="2013 rules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2013/Public_version_ESC_2013_Rules_ENG_FINAL.pdf |title=2013 Eurovision Song Contest rules |date=10 March 2013 |work=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |publisher=European Broadcasting Union |accessdate=10 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319103400/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2013/Public_version_ESC_2013_Rules_ENG_FINAL.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/48047/eurovision-rules-change-juries-are-ranking-all-the-songs/|title=Eurovision rules change: Juries are ranking all the songs|last=Repo|first=Juha|date=10 March 2013|publisher=ESCtoday.com|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each member of a respective nation's jury was required to rank every song, except that of their own country. The voting results from each member of a particular nation's jury were combined to produce an overall ranking from first to last place. Likewise, the televoting results were also interpreted as a full ranking, taking into account the full televoting result rather than just the top ten. The combination of the jury's full ranking and the televote's full ranking produced an overall ranking of all competing entries. The song which scored the highest overall rank received 12 points, while the tenth-best ranked song received 1-point. It was announced in the official Media Handbook that an official app would also be available for voters to vote via during the contest.&lt;ref name="Official App"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurovoix.com/2013/04/25/malmo13-new-voting-method/|title=Malmo'13: New Voting Method|last=Granger|first=Anthony|date=25 April 2013|publisher=Eurovoix.com|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semi-final allocation draw===
The draw that determined the semi-final allocation was held on 17 January 2013 at the Malmö City Hall.&lt;ref name="semi-final allocation date"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=71083&amp;_t=semi-final_participants_drawn_on_january_17|title=Semi-final participants drawn on January 17|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|date=3 January 2013|publisher=eurovision.tv|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A draw at the EBU headquarters determined that, due to their geographical proximity with Malmö, Denmark would perform in the first semi-final, while Norway would perform in the second semi-final. This provided a maximum availability of tickets for visitors from both countries.&lt;ref name="running order"/&gt; The EBU also allocated Israel to the second semi-final after a request from the delegation in order to avoid complications with a national holiday coinciding with the date of the first semifinal.&lt;ref name="Running order pots"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=tomorrow_countries_drawn_into_semi-finals_in_malmoe|title=Tomorrow: Countries drawn into Semi-Finals in Malmö|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|date=16 January 2013|work=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining participating countries, excluding the automatic finalists (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom), were split into five pots, based on voting patterns from the previous nine years. From these pots, 15 (in addition to Denmark) were allocated to compete in the first semi-final on 14 May 2013 and 15 (in addition to Norway and Israel) were allocated to compete in the second semi-final on 16 May 2013.&lt;ref name=allocation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=draw_results_whos_in_which_semi-final|title=Draw results: Who's in which Semi-Final?|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|date=17 January 2013|work=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Running order===
Unlike previous years, the running order was not decided by the [[Sortition|drawing of lots]], but instead by the [[Television producer|producers]], with the aim of making the shows more exciting and ensuring that all contestants had a chance to stand out, preventing entries that are too similar cancelling each other out.&lt;ref name="running order"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=running_order_malmoe_2013_to_be_determined_by_producers|title=Running order Malmö 2013 to be determined by producers|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|date=7 November 2012|work=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision elicited mixed reactions from both fans of the contest and participating broadcasters.&lt;ref name="running order fans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/?p=38497|title=Mixed feelings about Eurovision rule change|last=Repo|first=Juha|date=8 November 2012|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="running order ireland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/?p=39057|title=Ireland reacts to running order rule|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|date=19 November 2012|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="running order san marino"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/?p=39020|title=San Marino reacts to running order rule|last=Sanjay|first=Jiandani|date=16 November 2012|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="running order moldova"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/?p=38649|title=Moldova reacts to running order rule|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|date=14 November 2012|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphic design===
[[File:ESC2013 semi final 2 opening act 01.jpg|thumb|The stage with its movable parts and the audience closely surrounding it during the opening act of the second semi-final]]
As aforesaid, SVT wanted to make a good use of Malmo Arena's space to highlight the performances and increase the audience's visibility compared to previous years. SVT created a main stage and a smaller stage with higher-lower shifted floors, connected by a trail closely surrounded by a standing crowd from both sides of it and around the small stage. The main stage mobility was expressed as a main artistic medium at the opening act of the second semifinal and with highlighting Moldova's performance towards its finish, as a movable part beneath the singer's dress making her look gradually taller. The small stage mobility highlighted United Kingdom's performance towards its finish, lifted above the close-standing audience.

On 17 January 2013, at the semi-final allocation draw, the EBU revealed the graphic design, created by the Gothenburg-based [[branding agency]] [[Forsman &amp; Bodenfors|Happy F&amp;B]] for the 2013 contest, featuring a butterfly and slogan "We Are One".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=malmoe_2013_we_are_one|title=Malmö 2013: We are one|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|date=17 January 2013|work=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The butterfly featured an array of colours and textures, it also represented something small which can start powerful and big movements, a phenomenon known as the [[butterfly effect]], indicating that a flap from one [[butterfly]] can start a [[hurricane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/?p=38342 |title=Happy F&amp;B the agency to create the 2013 look |last=Repo |first=Juha |date=31 October 2012 |publisher=ESCToday.com |accessdate=1 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409233455/http://www.esctoday.com/?p=38342 |archivedate=9 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SVT confirmed on 19 February 2013 that the postcard films, used to introduce each song in the contest, would feature each artist in their respective country, to give the viewer a personal insight of each competing participant.

In addition to the graphic design, there was a theme music for the contest entitled ''"Wolverine"'' composed by Adam Kafe, which was used in the intros and in-between commercial breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=Wolverine|others=Kafe, Adam|date=2013|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/wolverine-single/id648537674|last=Kafe|first=Adam|type=Digital Download|publisher=iTunes|id=648537674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National host broadcaster===
On 11 July 2012, the show producer [[Christer Björkman]] advised the public not to buy tickets for the 2013 Contest that are currently in circulation and instead to wait for tickets to be released through official channels. Björkman said that official tickets had not yet been released, as necessary decisions over the stage and seating plans had not yet been made.&lt;ref name="Don't buy tickets yet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=63543&amp;_t=swedish_hosts_advise_fans_on_tickets_and_accommodation_for_malmoe_2013|title=Swedish hosts advise fans on tickets and accommodation for Malmö 2013|last=Storvik-Green|first=Simon|date=11 July 2012|work=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Björkman also gave reassurance that accommodation would be available, as while the organizers had booked a large quantity of hotel rooms, some may be made available to the general public.&lt;ref name="Don't buy tickets yet" /&gt; On 21 November 2012, SVT officially announced the launch of ticket sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/?p=39134 |title=First tickets released for sale on Monday 26 November |last=Repo |first=Juha |date=21 November 2012 |publisher=ESCToday.com |accessdate=21 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211152737/http://www.esctoday.com/?p=39134 |archivedate=11 February 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 2012, the executive producer Martin Österdahl told the Swedish newspaper ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' that SVT plans for the 2013 Contest to have only one presenter for the entire contest, unlike previous years where there were up to three presenters per show. The last time there was just one presenter was in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995|1995 Contest]], in [[Dublin]], Ireland, when the solo host was [[Mary Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=5312493|title=Just one presenter for 2013 Eurovision|author=Radio Sweden|date=17 October 2012|work=[[Sveriges Radio]]|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=malmoe_just_one_presenter_in_2013|title=Malmö: Just one presenter in 2013|last=Storvik-Green|first=Simon|date=17 October 2012|work=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Petra Mede]] was announced as the host for the 2013 contest on 28 January 2013.&lt;ref name="Siim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=petra_mede_to_host_eurovision_2013|title=Petra Mede to host Eurovision Song Contest 2013|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|date=28 January 2013|work=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://escxtra.com/2013/01/petra-mede-will-host-the-eurovision-song-contest-2013/ |title=Petra Mede (she is knew as the best host ever of the Eurovision Song Contest) will host the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 |last=Waddell |first=Nathan |date=28 January 2013 |publisher=escXtra.com |accessdate=28 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328015715/http://escxtra.com/2013/01/petra-mede-will-host-the-eurovision-song-contest-2013/ |archivedate=28 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Azerbaijan vote rigging ===
Prior to the finals, the Lithuanian media outlet [[15 min]] released an undercover video suggesting that representatives from Azerbaijan were trying to [[bribery|bribe]] Lithuanians for votes in the tele/smsvoting.&lt;ref name="vote rigging"/&gt; The video detailed the plan, which involved recruiting groups of 10 people each, and supplying them with [[Subscriber identity module|SIM card]]s so they could vote multiple times during the voting window in the tele/smsvoting. It was also suggested that similar activity was taking place in a total of 15 countries including Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, Croatia and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Победитель "Евровидения-2013" куплен?

He stated that while Eurovision organisers were looking into the case, they "[emphasised] that the intention of these individuals have not yet been clarified, and nor has a link been established between the individuals in the video and the Azeri delegation, the Azeri act or the Azeri EBU member [[Ictimai TV]]." He added that, since 1998, when he was first involved with the contest, "every year there are rumors about irregularities in the voting".&lt;ref name="vote rigging"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision organisers respond to media reports on voting|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=87553&amp;_t=eurovision_organisers_respond_to_media_reports_on_voting|date=21 May 2013|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union|eurovision.tv]] |accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EBU later confirmed an attempt of cheating in the contest, which was unsuccessful according to EBU as the EBU's system prevent fraud. According to the EBU, there is no evidence that any broadcaster has been involved in cheating. The rules were changed the next year to ensure that all broadcasters would be responsible for preventing fraud to their advantage or face a three-year suspension if fraud is revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26081002|title=Eurovision Song Contest to ban cheats from show|last=|first=|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=7 February 2014|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in May 2015 a member of The Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group confirmed that Azerbaijan had cheated and that it was organized and very expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/noje/mans-radsla-for-fusket-i-arets-eurovision/|title=Måns rädsla för fusket i årets "Eurovision" (Swedish article)|last=Färsjö|first=Therese|publisher=Expressen|date=20 May 2015|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Azerbaijan officially awarded no points to [[Dina Garipova]] of Russia, despite Garipova having reportedly come second in the country's phone poll, the Azerbaijani President [[Ilham Aliyev]] ordered an inquiry. The Russian Foreign Affairs Minister [[Sergei Lavrov]] claimed that the result had been falsified, and stated that "this outrageous action will not remain without a response". He promised a co-ordinated response with his Azerbaijani counterpart [[Elmar Mammadyarov]]. Simultaneously, the Belarusian President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] claimed that his own country having received no points from Russia showed that the result must have been falsified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22609523 |title=Russia: Azerbaijan's Eurovision snub 'outrageous'|publisher=BBC News|date=21 May 2013|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, UK entrant Bonnie Tyler also claimed she overheard Russians complaining that Azerbaijan did not "give us the ten points we paid for." Event supervisor [[Sietse Bakker]] said the claims were being investigated by the European Broadcasting Union as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2419782/TV-bosses-probe-claim-Eurovision-countries-offering-bribes-exchange-votes.html|title=Has Eurovision been fixed for years?

=== Plagiarism allegations===
[[Cascada]]'s entry for Germany, "[[Glorious (Cascada song)|Glorious]]", was the subject of investigation by [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] following allegations that it was too similar to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012]] winner, "[[Euphoria (Loreen song)|Euphoria]]" by [[Loreen (singer)|Loreen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Day |first=Matthew |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/9879617/Germany-copies-last-years-Eurovision-winner.html |title=Germany 'copies' last year's Eurovision winner |publisher=Telegraph |date=19 February 2013 |accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; NDR spokeswoman Iris Bents played down the allegations, stating that "Every year there are attempts to create scandals around the Eurovision Song Contest and the participants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/46274/20130219/#.USQpjh1t2So |title=Plagiarism probe into Euphoria 'copy' - The Local |publisher=Thelocal.se |date=19 February 2013 |accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an independent audit, "Glorious" was found not to have plagiarized "Euphoria".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blackburn|first=Gavin|title='Glorious' gets green light for Malmö|url=http://www.dw.de/glorious-gets-green-light-for-malm%C3%B6/a-16643622|publisher=dw.de (Deutsche Welle)|accessdate=13 November 2013|date=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations of plagiarism against the winning Danish entry surfaced after [[Eric van Tijn]], a notable Dutch music producer, mentioned the opening flute solo's similarity to "I Surrender", a 2002 song by the Dutch band K-Otic. However Eric van Tijn also stated that the flute solo was the only similarity between the two songs, thus calling it "a storm in a teacup".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=One in three watch Anouk but is the Eurovision winner a Dutch copy?|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2013/05/one_in_three_watch_anouk_but_i.php|accessdate=22 May 2013|publisher=DutchNews.nl|date=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland's same-sex kiss===
[[File:ESC2013 - Finland 07 (crop).jpg|thumb|Finland's contestant Krista Siegfrids kissing one of her backing singers.]]
The performance of the [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013|Finnish]] entry, "Marry Me", caused controversy in certain more socially conservative countries broadcasting the contest. The act featured the female singer [[Krista Siegfrids]] and one of her female backing singers kissing each other at the end, widely labelled in media as Eurovision's first "lesbian kiss". Siegfrids stated to the media that the act was done to encourage Finland to legalise same sex marriage. It was reported that Turkish and Greek media reacted negatively to Siegfrids' act.&lt;ref name="independent-2013kiss"&gt;{{cite news|last= Wyatt|first= Daisy|title= Eurovision 2013 to feature first lesbian kiss in protest against lack of gay marriage legislation|work= The Independent|date= 17 May 2013|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/eurovision-2013-to-feature-first-lesbian-kiss-in-protest-against-lack-of-gay-marriage-legislation-8621231.html|accessdate= 22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gay Star News]], the [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest|Turkish]] Eurovision broadcaster [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT]], who had earlier withdrawn from competing in the contest for 2013, initially indicated that they would still broadcast the contest, but made a late decision not to do so.&lt;ref name="gaystarnews-2013kiss"&gt;{{cite web|last1= Morgan|first1= Joe|last2 =Littauer| first2= Dan|title =Turkey cancels Eurovision Song Contest over lesbian kiss|quote=Turkey’s TRT, the official television channel, first said they will broadcast the Eurovision Song Contest despite the country not taking part this year.|publisher= Gay Star News|date= 16 May 2013|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/turkey-cancels-eurovision-song-contest-over-lesbian-kiss160513|accessdate= 22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of media reports directly linked this decision to the kiss in the Finnish performance, although TRT stated the reason was low viewing figures for the contest.&lt;ref name="mirror-2013kiss"&gt;{{cite web|last= Gripper |first= Ann|title= Double denim, a lesbian kiss and Loreen's return: Eurovision 2013's best pictures|work= [[Daily Mirror]] |date= 20 May 2013|url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/eurovision-2013s-best-pictures-double-1900340|accessdate= 22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ninemsn-2013kiss"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision winner announced |publisher=NineMSN |date=19 May 2013 |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/entertainment/2013/05/19/12/14/denmark-claims-eurovision-win |accessdate=22 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607114649/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/entertainment/2013/05/19/12/14/denmark-claims-eurovision-win |archivedate=7 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, it was completely removed from the pre-recorded broadcast due to the branch of television censorship in Mainland China.

===Eric Saade===
Green room host [[Eric Saade]] referred to [[Petra Mede]] as a "[[MILF (slang)|MILF]]" on air during the break between the first and second halves of the voting, saying "Back to you, Petra. [[hashtag|#]]MILF". When the broadcaster for the United Kingdom, [[BBC]] aired this, the sound was lost.

It was reported by the EBU that the 2013 Contest was viewed by a worldwide television audience of a record breaking 170 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svt.se/kultur/musik/fler-an-170-miljoner-sag-eurovision-song-contest|title=Fler än 170 miljoner såg Eurovision Song Contest|trans-title=More than 170 million watched the Eurovision Song Contest|language=Swedish|date=29 May 2013|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |accessdate=29 May 2013|work=Kulturnyheterna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voting and spokespersons ===
The order in which each country announced their votes was determined in a draw following the jury results from final dress rehearsal. Similar to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012 contest]] an [[algorithm]] was used to generate as much suspense as possible. The spokespersons are shown alongside each country.&lt;ref name="voting"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roxburgh|first=Gordon|title="Good evening Malmö" – Jury order revealed|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=good_evening_malmoe_-_jury_order_revealed|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=18 May 2013|date=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''FIA GT Championship''' was a [[sports car racing]] series organized by the [[Stéphane Ratel Organisation]] (SRO) at the behest of the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA). The championship was mostly concentrated in [[Europe]], but throughout the years has visited other continents including [[Asia]] and [[South America]]. At the end of 2009, the championship was replaced by the [[FIA GT1 World Championship]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gt1world.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt; which morphed into the [[Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup|FIA GT Series]] for 2013.

== Regulations ==
FIA currently defines several categories of [[grand tourer|GT cars]] with the top two specifications being GT1, or '''Grand Touring Cars''', and GT2, or '''Series Grand Touring Cars'''. Each category has an annual driver champion, team champion, and manufacturer champion. Both categories are based on production road car designs, which must be produced in a [[Homologation_(motorsport)|minimum quantity of 25 examples]] to qualify. Both types may undergo significant modifications from the road car they are based on, but GT1 allows the use of exotic materials, better [[aerodynamics]], larger [[brake]]s, wider [[tire]]s and larger engine admission restrictors.

For the 2006 season, the FIA created a new class called GT3. GT3 cars are even closer to their production counterparts and are very simply racetrack prepared with the essentials (rollcages for safety, stripped interiors, race spec fuel tanks, etc.).  All cars are performance balanced together via different weights, restrictors, tyre pressures etc. Prestigious motorsports makes such as [[Aston Martin]], [[Chevrolet]], [[Dodge]], [[Lamborghini]], [[Ascari Cars|Ascari]] and [[Maserati]] take part in [[FIA GT3 European Championship]], a support series in some rounds of the main championship.

The FIA defines a [[Grand tourer|GT car]] as "an open or closed automobile which has no more than one door on each side and a minimum of two seats situated one on each side of the longitudinal centre line of the car; these two seats must be crossed by the same transversal plane. This car must be able to be used perfectly legally on the open road, and adapted for racing on circuits or closed courses."

All races in the FIA GT Championship were [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|of endurance type]], a full race distance lasting a minimum of 500&amp;nbsp;km or a maximum of three hours, with the exception of the [[Spa 24 Hours]], Istanbul 2 hours and the exhibition [[Mil Milhas Brasil]]eiras, which is run over a thousand miles (1609 km) and was planned to be a round of the championship in 2007. However, with the release of the [[2007 FIA GT Championship]] schedule and rules, the FIA GT series becomes more of a sprint race event, with all races being a maximum of 2 hours with the exception of the [[Spa 24 Hours]].

==History==
[[Image:C5R and Maserati.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A [[Maserati MC12]] competing against a [[Chevrolet Corvette C5-R]]]]
{{For|information on the earlier series|BPR Global GT Series}}
{{Essay-like|section|date=September 2010}}
In 1997, due to increasing interest from manufacturers such as [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Porsche]] and [[Panoz]], the FIA took over control of the expanding [[BPR Global GT Series]], standardizing the race-length at 500&amp;nbsp;km instead of the usual four hours, liberalizing the technical regulations and leaving commercial exploitation in the hands of one of BPR's founders, Stéphane Ratel, who managed to get TV support from the pan-European TV station [[Eurosport]]. The new manufacturers built "homologation specials", racing-bred cars that took full advantage of the new rules, to build quasi-prototypes with very limited production runs of 25 cars. [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]], [[Lister Cars|Lister]] and Marcos, not wanting to accompany the cost escalation, moved down to the GT2 class.

This proved to be the wisest move,{{Says who|date=March 2015}} as Mercedes completely dominated the new category and the other manufacturers pulled out after the end of the 1998 season. This left Chrysler's [[Dodge Viper|Viper]] to become the dominating car in the series, with the aging Porsche 993 GT2 and the [[Lister Storm]] providing a certain degree of competition.

However, there was no lower inexpensive category for amateur drivers, and this led to the creation of the [[Group NGT|N-GT]] class in 2000. While the manufacturer field in the main class blossomed, the new category became swamped with Porsches and Ferraris, but lower running costs meant both classes enjoyed a balanced number of entries. In order to boost the championship's status, the SRO added the [[24 Hours of Spa]], previously a [[touring car racing|touring car race]], to the calendar, where it became the series' most important race. The FIA also banned official manufacturer involvement, although certain teams had preferential treatment, with Porsche establishing a "round robin" system.

After the end of the 2004 season, the FIA renamed the classes GT1 and GT2, and somewhat liberalized the GT1 regulations, allowing "supercars". While this was made to accommodate the [[Saleen S7]], the biggest beneficiary was the purpose-built [[Maserati MC12]], which lead the FIA to impose aerodynamic limitations on the Italian car. However, thanks to a weight penalty system, the fight for the championship is protected from more domineering cars. The level of competition remains tight, with gentlemen drivers managing to fight for the wins with professional drivers, some of them with [[Formula One]] experience.

Following the 2009 season, the [[Stéphane Ratel Organisation|SRO]] announced that the FIA GT Championship's two categories, GT1 and GT2, would break off into separate series. The GT1 category became a [[List of world championships|world championship]] with rounds across the world. Cars which fit the GT1 class were eligible to race only in the [[FIA GT1 World Championship]], as the ACO (organizer of the [[Le Mans 24 Hours]]) banned the cars from the event and all of its associated series. This meant that the category that once was eligible to race not only in the FIA GT, Le Mans Series and numerous national championships, was now only able to run in the new World Championship.

The GT1 cars continued to race in the World Championship in 2010 and 2011, but in 2012 the series switched exclusively to GT3 machinery due to shrinking car counts and the fact that most of the cars were ageing and no one was willing to build new models. This meant that the San Luis round of the 2011 season was the last ever time GT1 cars contested in international motorsport. The 2012 FIA GT1 season was contested with GT3 cars (yet retaining GT1 in series' title), but the series was finally cancelled after the year had concluded, being replaced by the FIA GT Series.

In 2010 the GT2 class was planned to have a separate championship having rounds held only in [[Europe]], known as the FIA GT2 European Championship, but this series was cancelled.  A lone GT2 event was held in 2010 at the [[2010 24 Hours of Spa|Spa 24 Hours]] with the winners being awarded the FIA GT2 European Cup. This was the last ever time GT2-spec cars contested in SRO-sanctioned series.

A new [[Blancpain Endurance Series]] was announced for 2011 which will re-establish some of the endurance format of the former FIA GT Championship, although this series will only utilize the FIA's GT3, GT4, and Supersports categories (GT2 was also planned to be in the series, but this was quickly folded as the interest level wasn't high).  However, this series will not be an FIA-sanctioned championship. In 2012 the series abandoned the GT4 class and moved to GT3 exclusively.

==Champions==
{{main|List of FIA GT Champions}}
As of the end of the [[2009 FIA GT Championship|2009 season]], [[Vitaphone Racing Team]] have won their fifth consecutive Teams' Championship in the GT1 category, while [[AF Corse]] earned their fourth consecutive title.  [[Michael Bartels]] and [[Andrea Bertolini]], both driving for Vitaphone, earned their third Drivers' Championship titles in the past four seasons.  [[Richard Westbrook]] of Prospeed Competition won the GT2 Drivers' Championship.  [[Chris Niarchos]] won the Citation Cup while [[Ferrari]] won the returning Manufacturers' Championship for the GT2 category.

[[File:Лепёшки из лебеды и машинного масла.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Breads made of [[Garden orache|orache]] and [[bran]], fried in [[machine oil]], were used as food in [[Siege of Leningrad|besieged Leningrad]]]]

A '''famine food''' or '''poverty food''' is any inexpensive or readily available food used to [[nourishment|nourish]] people in times of [[hunger]] and [[starvation]], whether caused by [[extreme poverty]] such as during [[Depression_(economics)|economic depression]]; by natural disasters, such as [[drought]]; or by [[war]] or [[genocide]]. 

Foods associated with famine need not be nutritionally deficient, or unsavoury. People who eat famine food in large quantity over a long period of time may become averse to it over time.  In times of relative affluence, these foods may become the targets of social stigma and rejection.

The characterization of a foodstuff as "famine" or "poverty" food is primarily social. For example [[lobster]] and other [[crustacea]]ns may be considered poverty food in some societies and luxury food in others depending on periods.

== Examples ==
A number of foodstuffs have been strongly associated with famine, war, or times of hardship throughout history:

*The [[Brosimum alicastrum|breadnut]] or Maya nut was cultivated by the ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]]ns but is largely rejected as a poverty food in modern Central America.
*In [[Polynesia]], plants from the genus ''[[Xanthosoma]]'', plants known locally as ''ʻape'', were considered famine food and used only when the [[taro]] crop failed.
*Several species of edible [[kelp]], including [[dulse]], [[Pelvetia|channelled wrack]] and Irish moss (''[[Chondrus crispus]]''), were eaten by coastal peasants during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in [[Ireland]] of 1846–48. Further inland, famine foods included [[Urtica dioica|stinging nettle]], [[Sinapis arvensis|wild mustard]], [[sorrel]] and [[watercress]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ballinagree.freeservers.com/codowngd9.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=ArU5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT104&amp;dq=charlock+famine&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIjfr3kszZAhXqDMAKHT76C7IQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=charlock+famine&amp;f=false|title=The Little Book of Fermanagh|first=Doreen|last=McBride|date=8 February 2018|publisher=History Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=D77BvmFwDogC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=charlock+famine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-QU5m71Cy4&amp;sig=EK46hh1TCGozbibyMtcVfcwbyZo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl1JLZkszZAhWHWsAKHWlGBg8Q6AEITDAK#v=onepage&amp;q=charlock+famine&amp;f=false|title=The Great Famine and the Irish Diaspora in America|first=Arthur|last=Gribben|date=1 March 1999|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sources.nli.ie/Record/PS_UR_061058|title=Holdings: Nettles and charlock as famine food.|website=sources.nli.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Calochortus nuttallii|Sego lily]] bulbs were eaten by the [[Mormon pioneers]] when their food crops failed.
*[[Tulip]] bulbs and [[beetroot]]s were eaten in the German-occupied parts of the Netherlands during the "[[Dutch famine of 1944|hunger winter]]" of 1944-45.
* In ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]],'' [[Jared Diamond]] posits that disdain for seafood, including fish, [[ringed seal]], and [[whale]], as poverty food contributed to the collapse of the [[Greenland Norse]].
* During a number of [[droughts and famines in Russia and the Soviet Union|famines in Russia and the Soviet Union]], [[Urtica dioica|nettle]], [[orache]], and other types of wild plants were used to make breads or soups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atn.kharkov.ru/newsread.php?id=42547 "Бурьян, крапива и лебеда. На одном из харьковских хлебозаводов выпекли "голодоморский" хлеб"], ATN [[Kharkiv]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cat meat]] was eaten in the northern Italian regions of [[Piedmont]], [[Emilia-Romagna]], and [[Liguria]] in times of famine, such as during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TV chef dropped for cat recipe comments |author=Jim Clancy |newspaper=[[CNN]] |date=2010-02-24 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/02/24/italy.chef.cat/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Likewise, during the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]] in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the menu in Parisian cafes was not limited to cats but also dogs, rats, horses, donkeys, camels, and even elephants.
*During the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya]], due to a severe shortage of rice, the locals resorted to surviving on hardy tuberous roots such as [[cassava]], [[sweet potato]], and [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]].
*In the [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] areas of [[Brazil]]ian [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]], the shoots and leaves of cactus ''[[Opuntia cochenillifera]]'' are normally used to feed the livestock ([[cattle]] and [[goat]]s). But during long [[drought]]s, people may use them as a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.df.ufcg.edu.br/~fred/palmas/culinariacombroto/nordeste.htm Broto de Palma na culinária nordestina (''Palma shoots in northeastern cuisine'') GUEDES, Claudet Coelho. Federal University of Campina Grande. Access on January 15th, 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Historically in the [[Maldives]] the leaves of seaside trees such as the [[octopus bush]] and the [[beach cabbage]] were often used as famine food.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/4398927/Eating_on_the_Islands_-_As_times_have_changed_so_has_the_Maldives_unique_cuisine_and_culture Eating on the Islands - As times have changed, so has the Maldives' unique cuisine and culture]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[caper]], the flower bud and berry of ''Capparis spinosa'' species, has been a famine food in southern Ethiopia and Sudan as well as in the 1948 [[Battle_for_Jerusalem#Food_rationing|siege of west Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Yves Guinand and Dechassa Lemessa, [http://www.ocha-eth.org/Archive/DownloadableReports/famp0300.pdf "Wild-Food Plants in Southern Ethiopia: Reflections on the role of 'famine-foods' at a time of drought"] UN-OCHA Report, March 2000 (accessed 15 January 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahmed|first1=Badawi Ibrahim|title=Famine foods in eastern regions of the Sudan|url=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/29/050/29050572.pdf|website=IAEA|accessdate=23 April 2017|location=MS thesis, Agriculture, Univ Khartoum|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the [[Cambodian humanitarian crisis]] people ate [[Cyriopagopus albostriatus|tarantulas]], scorpions, silkworms, and grasshoppers.

The '''Feminale''' in [[Cologne]] is [[Germany]]'s oldest [[feminism|feminist]] [[film festival]]. It has been held annually since 1984.

The Feminale was founded by students of [[film theory]] from the [[University of Cologne]]. Participating films must be made by females. They cover a broad spectrum of [[film genre]]s, including [[experimental film]]s and [[short film]]s.

The festival aims to voice the concerns of women in the [[film industry]]. It provides female [[director (film)|film makers]] with a platform for presenting their work to the public, and encourages presentation and discussion of changes in film [[aesthetics]] from a female point of view.

The site is also known in published reports as '''Chotscho''', '''Khocho''', '''Qocho''', or '''Qočo'''.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The archaeological remains are just outside the modern town of Gaochang, at a place called'' Idykut-schari'' or ''Idikutschari'' by local residents. (see the work of [[Albert Grünwedel]] in the external links below).  Artistic depictions of the city have been published by [[Albert von Le Coq]].

A busy trading center, it was a stopping point for merchant traders traveling on the [[Silk Road]].  It was destroyed in wars during the 14th century, and old palace ruins and inside and outside cities can still be seen today.

Near Gaochang is another major archeological site: the [[Astana Graves|Astana tombs]].

==History==
[[File:Seidenstrasse GMT.jpg|thumb|260px|Gaochang's location (close to [[Turpan]]) on the [[Silk Road]].]]

===Jushi Kingdom and early Han-Chinese rule===
{{main|Gushi culture}}
The earliest people known to have lived in the area were the [[Gushi culture|Gushi]] (or Jushi). The region around [[Turfan]] was described during the Han dynasty  (206 BCE – 220 CE) as being occupied by the ''Jūshī'', while control over the region swayed between the Han-Chinese and the [[Xiongnu]].

Gaochang was built in the 1st century BC, it was an important site along the [[Silk Road]]. It played a key role as a transportation hub in [[western China]].  The Jushi leaders invited the Chinese [[Han dynasty]] to take over{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} and pledged their allegiance.  In 327, the Gaochang [[Commandery (China)|Commandery]] (''jùn'') was created by the [[Former Liang]] under the Han Chinese ruler [[Zhang Gui]]. The Chinese set up a  military colony/garrison and organized the land into multiple divisions. Han Chinese colonists from the Hexi region and the central plains also settled in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcKtIPVQ6REC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=History of civilizations of Central Asia, Volume 3|editor=Ahmad Hasan Dani|year=1999|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|edition=|location=|isbn=81-208-1540-8|page=304|pages=|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Western Jin Dynasty]], northern China split into multiple states, including the Central Asian oases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;pg=PA186&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A history of Chinese civilization|author=Jacques Gernet|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|isbn=0-521-49781-7|page=186|pages=|accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gaochang was ruled by the [[Former Liang]], [[Former Qin]], and [[Northern Liang]] as part of a commandery.  In 383 The General Lu Guang of the [[Former Qin]] seized control of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ct=result&amp;id=9hMSAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Gaochang&amp;q=gaochang+significant&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Journal of Chinese religions, Issues 30-31|author=Society for the Study of Chinese Religions (U.S.), Indiana University, Bloomington.

In 439, remnants of the [[Northern Liang]],&lt;ref name="WhitfieldLibrary2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Susan Whitfield|author2=British Library|title=The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ArWLD4Qop38C&amp;pg=PA309&amp;dq=gaochang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj43I-Z7v3MAhXIKB4KHfx1DhYQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=gaochang&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=Serindia Publications, Inc.|isbn=978-1-932476-13-2|pages=309–}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[Juqu Wuhui]] and [[Juqu Anzhou]], fled to Gaochang where they would hold onto power until 460 when they were conquered by the [[Rouran Khaganate]]. Another version of this story says that in 439 a man named Ashina led 500 families from Gansu to Gaochang. In 460, the Rouran forced them to move to the Altai. They became the [[Ashina tribe|Ashina]] clan that formed the [[Gokturk Khaganate]]&lt;ref&gt;Christian, History of Russia, Central Asia and Mongolia, page 449, citing 'Sui annals' and Baumer, History of Central Asia, vol 2, page 174&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rouran, Gaoche, and Göktürk dominance over Gaochang's rulers===

From the mid-5th century until the mid-7th century, there existed four independent [[statelet]]s in the narrow Turpan basin.  These were controlled by the Kan clan, Zhang clan, Ma clan, and Qu clan.

A the time of its conquest by the Rouran Khaganate, there were more than ten thousand [[Han Chinese]] households in Gaochang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcKtIPVQ6REC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=History of civilizations of Central Asia, Volume 3|editor=Ahmad Hasan Dani|year=1999|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|edition=|location=|isbn=81-208-1540-8|page=305|pages=|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rouran Khaganate, which was based in Mongolia, appointed a Han Chinese named Kan Bozhou to rule as King of Gaochang in 460, and it became a separate vassal kingdom of the Khaganate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fAEUAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Kan+Bozhou+had+been+propped+up+as+its+king+by+the+Ruan-Ruan.|title=Proceedings of the Thirty-First International Congress of Human Sciences in Asia and North Africa, Tokyo-Kyoto, 31st August-7th September 1983, Volume 2|editor=Tatsurō Yamamoto|volume=|year=1984|publisher=Tōhō Gakkai|edition=|location=Indiana University|isbn=|page=997|pages=|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kan was dependent on Rouran backing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ORwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Kan+Bozhou,+who+seized+control+of+Gaochang,+relied+on+the+Ruanruan+for+support|title=Chinese archaeological abstracts: post Han|author1=Albert E.

At this time the [[Gaoche]] ({{linktext|高|車}}) was rising to challenge power of the Rouran in the [[Tarim Basin]]. The Gaoche king Afuzhiluo ({{linktext|阿|伏|至|羅}}) killed King Kan Shougui, who was the nephew of Kan Bozhou.&lt;ref name="louis"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kwOAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Zhang+Mengming+from+Dunhuang+on+the+throne+of+Gaochang|title=Encyclopaedia of Asian civilizations, Volume 3|author=Louis-Frédéric|year=1977|publisher=L.

Later, Zhang Mengming was killed in an uprising by the people of Gaochang and replaced by Ma Ru ({{linktext|馬|儒}}). In 501, Ma Ru himself was overthrown and killed, and the people of Gaochang appointed Qu Jia ({{linktext|麴|嘉}}) of Jincheng (in [[Gansu]]) as their king. Qu Jia hailed from the Zhong district of Jincheng commandery (金城, roughly corresponding to modern day [[Lanzhou]], [[Gansu]])&lt;ref name="UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS"/&gt; Qu Jia at first pledged allegiance to the Rouran, but the Rouran khaghan was soon killed by the Gaoche, and he had to submit to Gaoche overlordship. During Qu rule, powerful families established marriage ties with each other and dominated the kingdom, they included the Zhang, Fan, Yin, Ma, Shi, and Xin families. Later, when the [[Göktürks]] emerged as the supreme power in the region, the Qu dynasty of Gaochang became vassals of the Göktürks.&lt;ref name="chang"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=883OZBe2sMYC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The crossroads of civilizations: A.D. 250 to 750|author=Chang Kuan-ta|editors=Boris Anatol'evich Litvinskiĭ, Zhang, Guang-da, R.

While the material civilization of [[Kucha]] to its west in this period remained chiefly Indo-Iranian in character, in Goachang it gradually merged into the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] aesthetics.&lt;ref name="Rene"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Empire of the Steppes:A History of Central Asia |author=Rene Grousset |pages=98–99 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1991 |isbn=0813513049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 607 the ruler of Gaochang Qu Boya paid tribute to the [[Sui Dynasty]], but his attempt at sinicization provoked a coup which overthrew the Qu ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=883OZBe2sMYC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A history of Chinese civilization|author=Jacques Gernet|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|isbn=0-521-49781-7|page=253|pages=|accessdate=June 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Qu family was restored six years later, and the successor Qu Wentai welcomed the Tang pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] with great enthusiasm in 629 AD.&lt;ref name="Rene"/&gt;

The inhabitants of Qocho practiced [[Buddhism]], [[Manichaeism]] and [[Nestorian Christianity]].  The Uyghurs converted to Buddhism and sponsored building of temple caves in the nearby [[Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves]] where depictions of Uyghur sponsors may be seen.  The Buddhist Uyghur kings, who called themselves idiquts, retained their nomadic lifestyle, residing in Qocho during the winter, but moved to the cooler [[Jimsar County|Bishbalik]] near [[Urumchi]] in the summer.&lt;ref name="svat"&gt;{{cite book |title=A history of Inner Asia |author=Svatopluk Soucek |chapter=Chapter 4 - The Uighur Kingdom of Qocho |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-65704-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qocho later became a [[vassal]] state of the [[Kara-Khitan]]s.  However, In 1209, the idiqut [[Baurchuk Art Tekin|Barchuq]] offered [[Genghis Khan]] the [[suzerainty]] of his kingdom, and went personally to Genghis Khan with a sizeable tribute when demanded in 1211.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Biran, Michal. |title=The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History: Between China and the Islamic World  |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |page=75 |isbn= 0-521-84226-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Uyghurs thus went into the service of the Mongols,&lt;ref name="svat 1"&gt;{{cite book |title=A history of Inner Asia |author=Svatopluk Soucek |chapter=Chapter 7 - The Conquering Mongols |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-65704-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who later formed the [[Yuan Dynasty]] in China. The Uyghurs became bureaucrats (''[[semu]]'') of the Mongol Empire and their [[Old Uyghur alphabet|Uyghur script]] was modified for Mongolian.  As far south as [[Quanzhou]], preponderance of Gaochang Uyghur in [[Church of the East|Nestorian Christian]] inscriptions of the Yuan period attests to their importance in the Christian community there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chinaheritagenewsletter.anu.edu.au/scholarship.php?searchterm=005_zayton.inc&amp;issue=005 The Stones of Zayton speak] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024092550/http://chinaheritagenewsletter.anu.edu.au/scholarship.php?searchterm=005_zayton.inc&amp;issue=005 |date=2013-10-24 }}, ''China Heritage Newsletter'', No. 5, March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gaochang area was [[Islamicisation and Turkicisation of Xinjiang#Khizr Khoja.27s attack on Turfan and Qocho|conquered by]] the Mongols of the [[Chagatai Khanate]] (not part of [[Yuan Dynasty]]) from 1275 to 1318 by as many as 120,000 troops.

==Buddhism==
[[Buddhism]] spread to China from India along the northern branch of the Silk Road predominantly in the 4th and 5th centuries as the Liang rulers were Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lszl.zjcnt.com/publish/content.php/130631 北凉且渠安周造寺碑] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820081958/http://lszl.zjcnt.com/publish/content.php/130631 |date=2011-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building of Buddhist grottos probably began during this period.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10680">'''Gold laundering''' is the process whereby illegally obtained [[gold]] is [[Melting|melted]] and [[Casting (metalworking)|recast]] into another form. The recasting is performed to obscure or conceal the true origin of the gold. The recast gold is then sold, thus laundering it into [[cash]].

It may also refer to a [[money laundering]] transaction in which the exchanged good is gold.

==Process==
There are several stages in the gold laundering process. The first is the acquisition of the gold, which may be from any combination of sources, at least one of which is illegal. This is then treated as [[scrap metal]], melted,{{sfn|Rey Mallén|2013}} then cast into a [[Molding (process)|mold]]. This results in a transportable [[ingot]], [[gold bar]] or other bulk form [[bullion]].

In some cases, there is no gold involved in the laundering scheme. [[Colombia]] reported 70 tons of gold exports for 2012 despite production of only 15 tons.{{sfn|Colombia faces $17bn laundry bill}} This is a result of fictitious gold exports filed with the Colombian customs agency by [[drug cartel]]s in order to import "cash from international drug deals".{{sfn|Colombia faces $17bn laundry bill}}

===Acquisition===
Acquisition of the gold occurs in many forms.

Small-scale [[gold mining]] operations, particularly those with no permits or licences,{{sfn|Colombia faces $17bn laundry bill}} [[Gold extraction|extract gold]] from areas unsuitable for large [[mining]] operations. Gold obtained in this fashion that is exported may not be traced or authenticated.{{sfn|President Mahama charges Inter-Ministerial Task Force To Tackle Illegal Mining In Ghana}} This includes artisanal mines operated by few individuals, who then sell the gold to brokers.{{sfn|Rey Mallén|2013}}
[[Image:Buchenwald Property 80623.jpg|thumb|left|300px|As Minister of Economics, [[Walther Funk]] accelerated the pace of rearmament and as [[Reichsbank]] president banked for the SS the [[gold]] [[ring (jewellery)|ring]]s of [[Nazi concentration camp]] victims]]

Another form of acquisition is [[Metal theft|theft]]. In the 1940s, [[Nazi Germany]] forcibly obtained the possessions of Jews, sometimes in collaboration with other parties. Most victims who died in [[death camp]]s and [[Nazi concentration camp]]s were robbed of all valuable property by the state, which was then sold or, in the case of bullion, sent to the [[Reichsbank]]. For example, in 1945 the [[Hungarian Gold Train]] was established to transport the property of Hungarian Jews to [[Berlin]]. Once the Jews had been deported to German [[concentration camp]]s, the valuables were sorted into categories such that their owners could no longer be identified.{{sfn|Art Research Staff|1999}} In the late 1930s and throughout [[World War II]], Germany would increase its unofficial gold reserves by expropriating gold from foreign governments, including $223m from [[Belgium]] and $193m from the [[Netherlands]].{{sfn|UK Treasury}} Some of the [[Nazi gold]] was exchanged for cash,{{sfn|Simons|1999}} and some deposited in financial institutions, including $316 million of the looted gold at the [[Swiss National Bank]].{{sfn|Independent Commission of Experts Switzerland}} Of the nearly 100 tons of gold laundered through Swiss banks, only 4 tons was returned.{{sfn|Simons|1999}} The [[Banco de Portugal]], the [[central bank]] of [[Portugal]], would regularly purchase Nazi gold held at the Swiss National Bank, according to a 1944 document from the [[American Overseas Special Services]].{{sfn|DePalma|1997}}&lt;ref&gt;In one transaction, the Swiss National Bank instructed the [[Bank of Canada]] to transfer four tons of gold it had held there since before World War II to the [[Banco de Portugal]]. Similar transactions for 15.5 tons of gold were made with the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]].{{sfn|DePalma|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refining===
{{See also|Refining (metallurgy)|millesimal fineness}}

The scrap gold is then sold by brokers to smelters or [[Refining (metallurgy)|refiners]], who heat the gold to at least {{convert|1064|°C|°F}}, its [[melting point]].{{sfn|Perry|1995|p=182}} This may include gold from numerous sources, including recycled and newly mined gold. Once melted, it may be purified by [[Gold parting|parting]], which separates out [[silver]] impurities, and the [[Miller process]] or [[Wohlwill process]], depending on the desired level of purity and scale of operation.

Once refined, it is cast into a transportable form for further processing. [[Gold fingerprinting]], that is identifying a particular source of gold based on its impurities or trace elements, may be possible if the impurities have not been removed via refining.

==Effects==
To prevent laundering of gold and other metals (such as [[tantalum]], [[tin]], and [[tungsten]]), some nations have established systems and regulations. For example, [[Rwanda]] introduced regulations for mineral trade that requires all ore extraction be tagged, in part a response to the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] in the [[United States]] that requires companies to disclose the use of [[conflict mineral]]s by publishing a [[supply chain]] audit.{{sfn|Manson|2013}}

However, with only 100 government monitors overseeing 450 mining sites during typical business hours, smuggling still occurs, exacerbated by corrupt monitors illegally selling tags or failing to record transactions in logbooks.{{sfn|Manson|2013}}

In 2013, [[Ghana]]ian president [[John Dramani Mahama]] announced that the [[government of Ghana]] would establish a task force to regulate the small-scale mining sector.{{sfn|President Mahama charges Inter-Ministerial Task Force To Tackle Illegal Mining In Ghana}} This was to ensure that gold produced in small-scale mines could be authenticated, and also to eliminate the use of [[Heavy equipment|heavy machinery]] that had become prevalent on such sites, which have  caused [[Environmental impact of mining|environmental damage]].{{sfn|President Mahama charges Inter-Ministerial Task Force To Tackle Illegal Mining In Ghana}}

The [[government of Uganda]] obtained $200 million in trade revenue from the sale of gold in 2012, but expects that to decrease in 2013 as a result of [[illegal mining]] operations.{{sfn|Jaramogi|2013}}

The group [[InSight Crime]] claims that illegal mining represents up to 30% of the revenues of the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC).{{sfn|Rey Mallén|2013}}

On 22 November 2000, the [[World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss banks]] was settled, providing a fund of $1.25 billion for restitution to individuals whose property was confiscated by the [[Nazi]]s during World War II.

'''Great Lakes Theater''' is a professional classic theater company in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], USA. Founded in 1962, Great Lakes is the second-largest regional theater in [[Northeast Ohio]].  It specializes in large-cast classic plays with a strong foundation in the works of [[Shakespeare]] and features an educational outreach program.  The company performs its main stage productions in rotating repertory at its state-of-the-art new home at the [[Hanna Theatre]], [[Playhouse Square]], which reopened on September 20, 2008.  The organization shares a resident company of artists with the [[Idaho Shakespeare Festival]].  On its main stage and through its education programs, GLT connects approximately 85,000 adults and students to the classics each season.

GLT's artistic directors have included [[Arthur Lithgow]], [[Lawrence Carra]], [[Vincent Dowling]], [[Gerald Freedman]], James Bundy (present Dean of the Yale School of Drama) and [[Charles Fee]], who engineered the company's production-sharing partnership with the [[Idaho Shakespeare Festival]]).&lt;ref name=gltf-AT-article&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greatlakestheater.org/hanna/Portals/7/GLTF%20American%20Theatre%20Article.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015020203/http://www.greatlakestheater.org/hanna/Portals/7/GLTF%20American%20Theatre%20Article.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Great Lakes Theater completed a $19.2M dollar capital campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greatlakestheater.org/hanna/Portals/7/Tom%20Hanks%20and%20Rita%20Wilson%20Gift%20Propels%20GLTF%20Campaign%20to%20Successful%20Conclusion.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110627164438/http://www.greatlakestheater.org/hanna/Portals/7/Tom%20Hanks%20and%20Rita%20Wilson%20Gift%20Propels%20GLTF%20Campaign%20to%20Successful%20Conclusion.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to renovate the Hanna Theatre as a new and permanent home for Great Lakes while creating an endowment for the theater company - preserving the legacy of the classics in Cleveland.  The honorary chair of the campaign was actor [[Tom Hanks]], who credits the Great Lakes Theater Festival for beginning his acting career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/onstage/index.ssf/2009/08/tom_hanks_at_the_hanna_benefit.html |title='Tom Hanks at the Hanna' benefits Great Lakes Theater Festival's renovations |accessdate=2009-10-23 |last=Brown |first=Tony |date=2009-08-31 |work=Cleveland Plain Dealer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Great Lakes Theater was formerly known as Great Lakes Theater Festival, which continues to be its legal name.  "Festival" was dropped from the classic theater company’s business name to better reflect its September through May season, and programming format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Lakes drops 'festival' from name |accessdate=2012-01-25 |last=Simakis|first=Andrea|date=2010-07-14 |work=Cleveland Plain Dealer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

Arthur Lithgow started what was going to be Great Lakes in the 1950s at [[Antioch College]], in [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]]. During the few years in Antioch, all of Shakespeare's plays were performed. The company traveled for performances at [[Stan Hywet Hall]] in Akron, the [[Toledo Zoo]], and [[Cuyahoga Falls]]. In 1961, Lithgow made an arrangement with Ohio Board of Education President Dorthy Teare, creating the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival.  GLSF premiered July 11, 1962 with'' [[As You Like It]]''. It continued at the Lakewood Civic Auditorium performing that play and five others in rotation.

Great Lakes moved from its original home in Lakewood, Ohio to Playhouse Square in 1982 to become the first resident company in Playhouse Square.

Notable alumni include [[Tom Hanks]] (1977-79 as an intern and core company member, and later winner of the Cleveland Critics' circle for best actor in Festival's production of ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]''), [[Donald Moffat]], [[Robert Englund]], [[Larry Linville]], [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Piper Laurie]], [[Jean Stapleton]], [[Hal Holbrook]] and [[Olympia Dukakis]].

==Artistic directors==

Lithgow expanded the repertoire beyond Shakespeare in 1965 and left his role as artistic director in 1966.

[[Lawrence Carra]] became the artistic director until 1975, followed by [[Vincent Dowling]] in 1976.  Dowling moved the company from its Lakewood Civic Auditorium home to the [[Ohio Theatre (Cleveland)|Ohio Theatre]] of the [[Playhouse Square Center]] in 1982.

[[Gerald Freedman]] became the artistic director in 1985. Under his direction, GLSF in 1985 changed to its name to the "Great Lakes Theater Festival," to reflect the broader body of work produced beyond Shakespeare. Freedman was followed by James Bundy in 1998.

[[Charles Fee]] has been the artistic director since 2002.

{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}
In [[futures studies]], '''human extinction''' is the hypothetical [[Extinction|end]] of the [[human|human species]]. This may result from natural causes or it may be [[human impact on the environment|the result of human action]].

The likelihood of human extinction in future by wholly natural scenarios, such as a [[Meteorite|meteorite impact]] or large-scale [[volcanism]], is generally considered to be extremely low.&lt;ref name="priorityBostrom2013"&gt;Bostrom, Nick. "[http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.html Existential risk prevention as global priority]". Global Policy 4.1 (2013): 15-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

For anthropogenic extinction, many possible scenarios have been proposed: human [[Nuclear Holocaust|global nuclear annihilation]], [[biological warfare]] or the release of a [[pandemic]]-causing agent, [[dysgenics]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}, [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Niall Firth |date=18 June 2010 |title=Human race 'will be extinct within 100 years', claims leading scientist |newspaper=Daily Mail |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1287643/Human-race-extinct-100-years-population-explosion.html |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ecological collapse]], and [[effects of climate change on humans|climate change]]; in addition, emerging technologies could bring about new extinction scenarios, such as [[existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence|advanced artificial intelligence]], [[biotechnology]] or [[grey goo|self-replicating nanobots]]. The probability of [[anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] human extinction within the next hundred years is the topic of an active debate.

Human extinction needs to be differentiated from the extinction of all life on Earth (see also [[future of Earth]]) and from the extinction of major components of human [[culture]] (e.g., through a global catastrophe leaving only small, scattered human populations, which might evolve in isolation).

==Moral importance of existential risk==

"Existential risks" are risks that threaten the entire future of humanity, whether by causing human extinction or by otherwise permanently crippling human progress.&lt;ref name="priorityBostrom2013" /&gt; Many scholars make an argument based on the size of the "cosmic endowment" and state that because of the inconceivably large number of potential future lives that are at stake, even small reductions of existential risk have great value. Some of the arguments run as follows:
* [[Carl Sagan]] wrote in 1983: "If we are required to calibrate extinction in numerical terms, I would be sure to include the number of people in future generations who would not be born.... (By one calculation), the stakes are one million times greater for extinction than for the more modest nuclear wars that kill "only" hundreds of millions of people. There are many other possible measures of the potential loss—including culture and science, the evolutionary history of the planet, and the significance of the lives of all of our ancestors who contributed to the future of their descendants. Extinction is the undoing of the human enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sagan | first1=Carl | date=1983 | title=Nuclear war and climatic catastrophe: Some policy implications | journal=Foreign Affairs | volume=62 | page=275 | doi=10.2307/20041818 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246982634_Nuclear_War_and_Climatic_Catastrophe_Some_Policy_Implications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Philosopher [[Derek Parfit]] in 1984 makes an [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] argument that, because all human lives have roughly equal intrinsic value no matter where in time or space they are born, the large number of lives potentially saved in the future should be multiplied by the percentage chance that an action will save them, yielding a large net benefit for even tiny reductions in existential risk.&lt;ref name=parfit&gt;Parfit, D. (1984) [[Reasons and Persons]]. Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Humanity has a 95% probability of being extinct in 7,800,000 years, according to J. Richard Gott's formulation of the controversial [[Doomsday argument]], which argues that we have probably already lived through half the duration of human history. 
*Philosopher [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] rejects in 1989 Parfit's "impersonal" views, but speaks instead of a moral imperative for loyalty and commitment to "the future of humanity as a vast project... The aspiration for a better society- more just, more rewarding, and more peaceful... our interest in the lives of our children and grandchildren, and the hopes that they will be able, in turn, to have the lives of their children and grandchildren as projects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Robert Merrihew|title=Should Ethics be More Impersonal? a Critical Notice of Derek Parfit, Reasons and Persons|journal=The Philosophical Review|date=October 1989|volume=98|issue=4|pages=439|doi=10.2307/2185115}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] argues in 2013 that [[preference-satisfactionist]], democratic, custodial, and intuitionist arguments all converge on the common-sense view that preventing existential risk is a high moral priority, even if the exact "degree of badness" of human extinction varies between these philosophies.&lt;ref name="priorityBostrom2013" /&gt;{{rp|23–4}}

Parfit argues that the size of the "cosmic endowment" can be calculated from the following argument: If Earth remains habitable for a billion more years and can sustainably support a population of more than a billion humans, then there is a potential for 10{{sup|16}} (or 10,000,000,000,000,000) human lives of normal duration.&lt;ref name="parfit" /&gt;{{rp|453–4}} Bostrom goes further, stating that if the universe is empty, then the [[cosmological horizon|accessible universe]] can support at least 10{{sup|34}} biological human life-years; and, if some humans were uploaded onto computers, could even support the equivalent of 10{{sup|54}} cybernetic human life-years.&lt;ref name="priorityBostrom2013" /&gt;

==Possible scenarios==
{{See also|Global catastrophic risk|:Category:Doomsday scenarios}}

===Severe forms of known or recorded disasters===

* [[Nuclear warfare|Nuclear]] or [[biological warfare]]; for example, a future [[arms race]] may result in larger arsenals than those of the Cold War&lt;ref name="Bostrom2002"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nick |last=Bostrom |title=Existential Risks |journal=[[Journal of Evolution and Technology]] |volume=9 |date=March 2002 |url=http://www.jetpress.org/volume9/risks.html |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a hypothetical [[World War III]] could cause the total annihilation of humankind.
* A [[pandemic]]&lt;ref name="Bostrom2002" /&gt; involving one or more [[virus]]es, [[prion]]s, or [[antibiotic]]-resistant bacteria. Past examples include the [[Spanish flu]] outbreak in 1918 and the various European viruses that [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Epidemics in the Americas|decimated indigenous American populations]]. A deadly pandemic restricted to humans alone would be self-limiting as its mortality would reduce the density of its target population. A pathogen with a broad host range in multiple species, however, could eventually reach even isolated human populations, e.g. when using animals as "carriers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anders Sandberg |author2=Milan M.

However, they are confident that in practice, countries would be able to "recognize and intervene effectively" to halt the spread of such a microbe and prevent human extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/top-us-disease-fighters-warn-of-new-engineered-pathogens-but-call-bioweapons-doomsday-unlikely/|title=Top U.S. Disease Fighters Warn of New Engineered Pathogens but Call Bioweapons Doomsday Unlikely|last=Fiorill|first=Joe|date=29 July 2005|accessdate=10 September 2013|newspaper=Global Security Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Climate change]]; for example, global warming caused by human emission of carbon dioxide may render the planet uninhabitable. According to [http://www.desdemonadespair.net/2015/06/graph-of-day-carbon-emissions-and-human.html CDIAC] (The Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center) increases in carbon emissions per head is closely followed by the growth in human population (a nearly 4-fold increase in the past 100 years). On a longer time scale, [[Milankovitch cycles]], also known as Quaternary Climatic Oscillations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.2734/epdf|title = Quaternary climatic instability in south-east Australia from a multi-proxy speleothem record |last = Barker|first = P.

* [[Population decline]] through a preference for fewer children. If developing world demographics are assumed to become [[developed world]] [[demographics]], and if the latter are extrapolated, data suggest an extinction before 3000 AD. [[John A. Leslie]] estimates that if the reproduction rate drops to the [[Demographics of Germany|German level]] the extinction date will be 2400.{{Ref|2400}} However, [[evolutionary biology]] suggests the [[demographic transition]] may reverse itself.
* A geological or cosmological disaster such as an [[impact event]] of a [[near-Earth object]],&lt;ref name="meteor" /&gt; a [[Gamma-ray burst#Hypothetical effects on Earth in the past|lethal gamma-ray burst]] in [[Gamma ray burst#Mass extinction on Earth|our part]] of the [[Milky Way]],&lt;ref name="time_super_duper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tuthill_subject_expert_faq" /&gt; a [[Supervolcano|supervolcanic]] [[Types of volcanic eruptions|eruption]], or natural long-term [[climate change]].

This scenario is special among the non-anthropogenic extinction scenarios in so far as it is conceivable to develop countermeasures for a large proportion of such impact events.

===Habitat threats===

* Human-induced changes to the atmosphere's composition may render Earth uninhabitable for humans. Carbon dioxide is toxic at high concentrations, causing death by respiratory acidosis (acidification of the blood), and lifelong exposure to even the moderately elevated concentrations projected to occur during the 21st century could cause chronic physical and mental health conditions in all humans. The upper limit, above which human survival and reproduction would be impossible, is still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bierwirth | first1 = P.N. | doi = 10.13140/RG.2.2.16787.48168 | title = Carbon dioxide toxicity and climate change: a serious unapprehended risk for human health. | year = 2016 | url = * http://grapevine.com.au/%7Epbierwirth/co2toxicity.pdf | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is no other population of a large vertebrate animal like humans in the history of the planet that has grown so much, so fast, or with such devastating consequences to fellow earthlings.

===Scientific accidents===

Without regulation, scientific advancement has a potential to risk human extinction as a result of the effects or use of totally new technologies. Some scenarios include:
* The creators of a "superintelligent" entity could inadvertently give it goals that lead it to [[Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|"annihilate" the human race]].&lt;ref name="Bostrom2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chalmers2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Chalmers|first1= David|date= 2010|title= The singularity: A philosophical analysis|journal= Journal of Consciousness Studies|volume= 17|issue= |pages= 9–10|accessdate=17 August 2013|url=http://consc.net/papers/singularity.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Uncontrolled nanotechnology ([[grey goo]]) incidents resulting in the destruction of the Earth's ecosystem ([[ecophagy]]).&lt;ref name="our final hour"&gt;[[Martin Rees]] (2004).

* Creation of a "[[micro black hole]]" on Earth during the course of a scientific experiment, or other unlikely scientific accidents in [[high-energy physics]] research, such as [[Vacuum metastability disaster|vacuum phase transition]] or [[strangelet]] incidents. There were worries concerning the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]] as it is feared that collision of protons at a speed near the speed of light will result in the creation of a black hole, but it has been pointed out that much more energetic collisions take place currently in Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name="our final hour" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16322014.700-a-black-hole-ate-my-planet.html|title=A black hole ate my planet|first=Robert|last=Matthews|publisher=New Scientist|date=28 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.org/units/dpf/governance/reports/upload/lhc_saftey_statement.pdf "Statement by the Executive Committee of the DPF on the Safety of Collisions at the Large Hadron Collider."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024184048/http://www.aps.org/units/dpf/governance/reports/upload/lhc_saftey_statement.pdf |date=24 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obsolete, disproven theory, perhaps collect in separate section?? - 
Early in the development of [[thermonuclear weapons]] there were some concerns that a fusion reaction could "ignite" the atmosphere in a chain reaction that would engulf Earth.

* [[Invasion]] by militarily superior [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] (see [[alien invasion]]) &amp;mdash; often considered to be a scenario purely from the realms of [[science fiction]], professional [[SETI|SETI researchers]] have given serious consideration to this possibility, but conclude that it is unlikely.{{Ref|AlienConquestUnlikely}}

=== Evolution of a posthuman species ===
{{Main|Posthumanism|Transhumanism}}

Normal [[Human evolution|biological evolution of humanity]] will continue and change humans over geological time scales. Although this could, in a non-[[Phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic taxonomy]], be considered to give rise of a new species, such an ongoing evolution would biologically not be considered a [[Extinction|species extinction]]. Given the likelihood that significant genetic exchange between human populations will continue, it is highly unlikely that humans will split into multiple species through natural evolution.

Some scenarios envision that humans could use [[genetic engineering]] or technological modifications to split into normal humans and a new species – [[Posthuman (Human evolution)|posthumans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/425804/emtech-get-ready-for-a-new-human-species/|title=EmTech: Get Ready for a New Human Species|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5vWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA188|title=Thomas Aquinas : teacher of humanity : proceedings from the first conference of the Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas held in the United States of America|isbn=978-1443875547|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1hYPZCZZUIEC&amp;pg=PA143|title=Perspectives on Health and Human Rights|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ulE-5xLdM5IC&amp;pg=PA8|title=Posthuman Suffering and the Technological Embrace|last1=Miccoli|first1=Anthony|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2014/06/11/320961912/the-transhuman-future-be-more-than-you-can-be|title=The Transhuman Future: Be More Than You Can Be|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dld-conference.com/articles/will-you-join-the-transhuman-evolution|title=WILL YOU JOIN THE TRANSHUMAN EVOLUTION?|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techinsider.io/rob-nail-says-humans-are-turning-into-a-new-species-2016-6|title=How humans are turning into a 'totally different species'|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a species could be fundamentally different from any previous life form on Earth, e.g. by merging humans with technological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=I, Cyborg|last=Warwick|first=Kevin|date=2004|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-07215-4|authorlink=Kevin Warwick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3423063/Is-technology-causing-evolve-new-SPECIES-Expert-believes-super-humans-called-Homo-optimus-talk-machines-digitally-immortal-2050.html|title=Is technology causing us to 'evolve' into a new SPECIES?

=== Extinction through devolution ===
Humans are doing so well that there's no more [[survival of the fittest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Michael|date=2016-3|title=Mutation and Human Exceptionalism: Our Future Genetic Load |journal=Genetics|volume=202|issue=3|pages=869–875|doi=10.1534/genetics.115.180471 |pmc=4788123|pmid=26953265}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was highly debated in the 19th century in the form of [[Devolution (biology)|devolution]] and [[Degeneration theory|degeneration]].

== Perception of and reactions to human extinction risk ==

=== Probability estimates ===

Because human extinction is unprecedented, speculation about the probability of different scenarios is highly subjective. Nick Bostrom argues that it would be "misguided" to assume that the probability of near-term extinction is less than 25% and that it will be "a tall order" for the human race to "get our precautions sufficiently right the first time", given that an existential risk provides no opportunity to learn from failure.&lt;ref name="priorityBostrom2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="matheny"&gt;Matheny, Jason G. "[http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/pmpmta/Mahoney_extinction.pdf Reducing the risk of human extinction]". [[Risk Analysis (journal)|Risk Analysis]] 27.5 (2007): 1335-1344.&lt;/ref&gt; A little more optimistically, philosopher [[John A. Leslie|John Leslie]] assigns a 70% chance of humanity surviving the next five centuries, based partly on the controversial philosophical [[doomsday argument]] that Leslie champions. The 2006 [[Stern Review]] for the UK Treasury assumes the 100-year probability of human extinction is 10% in its economic calculations.&lt;ref name="matheny" /&gt;

Some scholars believe that certain scenarios such as global [[Nuclear warfare|thermonuclear war]] would have difficulty eradicating every last settlement on Earth. Physicist Willard Wells points out that any credible extinction scenario would have to reach into a diverse set of areas, including the underground subways of major cities, the mountains of Tibet, the remotest islands of the South Pacific, and even to [[McMurdo Station]] in Antarctica, which has contingency plans and supplies for a long isolation.&lt;ref name="wells"&gt;Wells, Willard. Apocalypse when?. Praxis, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0387098364}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, elaborate bunkers exist for government leaders to occupy during a nuclear war.&lt;ref name="matheny" /&gt; Any number of events could lead to a massive loss of human life; but if the last few (but see [[minimum viable population]]), most resilient, humans are unlikely to also die off, then that particular human extinction scenario is not credible.&lt;ref&gt;Tonn, Bruce, and Donald MacGregor. "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1775342 A singular chain of events]". Futures 41.10 (2009): 706-714.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychology ===
{{See also|Existentialism#Angst and dread}}
[[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] theorizes that [[scope neglect]] plays a role in public perception of existential risks:&lt;ref name="priorityBostrom2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yudkowsky, Eliezer. "[https://intelligence.org/files/CognitiveBiases.pdf Cognitive biases potentially affecting judgment of global risks]". Global catastrophic risks 1 (2008): 86. p.114&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Substantially larger numbers, such as 500 million deaths, and especially qualitatively different scenarios such as the extinction of the entire human species, seem to trigger a different mode of thinking... People who would never dream of hurting a child hear of an existential risk, and say, "Well, maybe the human species doesn't really deserve to survive".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All past predictions of human extinction have proven to be false. To some, this makes future warnings seem [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf|less credible]]. [[Nick Bostrom]] argues that the lack of human extinction in the past is weak evidence that there will be no human extinction in the future, due to [[survivor bias]] and other [[anthropic principle|anthropic effects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We're Underestimating the Risk of Human Extinction|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/were-underestimating-the-risk-of-human-extinction/253821/|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[behavioural finance]] scholars claim that [[recency effect|recent]] evidence is given undue significance in [[Risk analysis (business)|risk analysis]]. Roughly speaking, "100-year storms" tend to occur every twenty years in the [[stock market]] as traders become convinced that the current good times [[Dot-com bubble#Free spending|will last forever]]. Doomsayers who hypothesize rare [[stock market crash|crisis scenarios]] are dismissed even when they have statistical evidence behind them. An extreme form of this bias can diminish the [[Bayesian probability#Varieties of Bayesian probability|subjective probability]] of the unprecedented.{{Ref|unprecedented}}

=== Research and initiatives ===
Even though the importance and potential impact of research on existential risks is often highlighted, relatively few research efforts are being made in this field. In 2001 Bostrom stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.pdf|title=Existential Risks - Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios and Related Hazards|last = Bostrom|first = Nick|date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|There is more scholarly work on the life-habits of the [[dung fly]] than on existential risks [to humanity].}}

Although existential risks are less manageable by individuals than, e.g., health risks, according to [[Ken Olum]], [[Joshua Knobe]], and Alexander Vilenkin the possibility of human extinction ''does'' have practical implications. For instance, if the "universal" [[Doomsday argument]] is accepted it changes the most likely source of disasters, and hence the most efficient means of preventing them. They write: "... you should be more concerned that a large number of asteroids have not yet been detected than about the particular orbit of each one. You should not worry especially about the chance that some specific nearby star will become a supernova, but more about the chance that supernovas are more deadly to nearby life than we believe."&lt;ref&gt;"Practical application" page 39 of the [[Princeton University]] paper: [http://www.princeton.edu/~jknobe/physics.pdf Philosophical Implications of Inflationary Cosmology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050512134626/http://www.princeton.edu/~jknobe/physics.pdf |date=12 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple organizations with the goal of helping prevent human extinction exist. Examples are the [[Future of Humanity Institute]], the [[Centre for the Study of Existential Risk]], the [[Future of Life Institute]], the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], and the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute (est. 2011).

==Omnicide==
[[File:Placard against human extinction, Extinction Rebellion (cropped).jpg|thumb|Placard against omnicide, at [[Extinction Rebellion]] (2018).]]

Omnicide is human extinction as a result of human action. Most commonly it refers to extinction through [[nuclear warfare]] or [[biological warfare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rose Somerville |author2=John Somerville, introduction |date=1981 |title=Soviet Marxism and nuclear war : an international debate : from the proceedings of the special colloquium of the XVth World Congress of Philosophy |publisher=Greenwood Press |page=151 |isbn=978-0-313-22531-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodman |first=Lisl Marburg |author2=Lee Ann Hoff |date=1990 |title=Omnicide: The Nuclear Dilemma |location=New York |publisher=Praeger |isbn=978-0-275-93298-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Daniel Landes |date=1991 |title=Confronting Omnicide: Jewish Reflections on Weapons of Mass Destruction |publisher=Jason Aronson, Inc |isbn=978-0-87668-851-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it can also apply to extinction through means such as a global [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[Environmental disaster|ecological catastrophe]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, Richard Brian. 2004. ''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265576395_The_Ecology_of_Hope_Environmental_Grassroots_Activism_in_Japan The Ecology of Hope: Environmental Grassroots Activism in Japan]''. Ph.D. Dissertation, Union Institute &amp; University, College of Graduate Studies. Page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Omnicide can be considered a subcategory of [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0967010606064141 | last1 = Jones | first1 = Adam | date = 2006 | title = A Seminal Work on Genocide | url = | journal = Security Dialogue | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 143–144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the concept in this way, one can argue, for example, that:{{cquote|The [[Nuclear arms race|arms race]] is genocidal in intent given the fact that the United States and the Soviet Union are knowingly preparing to destroy each other as viable national and political groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Santoni | first1 = Ronald E. | date = 1987 | title = Genocide, Nuclear Omnicide, and Individual Responsibility | url = | journal = Social Science Record | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 38–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the Cold War arms race differed from genocide in that the weapons involved were not used, instead serving as [[nuclear deterrence]].

[[Stephen Hawking]] advocated [[space colonization|colonizing other planets]] within the solar system once technology progresses sufficiently, in order to improve the chance of human survival from planet-wide events such as global thermonuclear war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malik|first1=Tariq|title=Stephen Hawking: Humanity Must Colonize Space to Survive|url=http://www.space.com/20657-stephen-hawking-humanity-survival-space.html|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shukman|first1=David|title=Hawking: Humans at risk of lethal 'own goal'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35344664|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this would create the possibility of [[interstellar war]], which could be even more destructive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

More economically, some scholars propose the establishment on Earth of one or more self-sufficient, remote, permanently occupied settlements specifically created for the purpose of surviving global disaster.&lt;ref name="matheny" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wells" /&gt; Economist [[Robin Hanson]] argues that a refuge permanently housing as few as 100 people would significantly improve the chances of human survival during a range of global catastrophes.&lt;ref name="matheny" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Robin.

==In popular culture==
&lt;!-- This section should remain brief and well-sourced; more detailed examples should go in "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction" article. --&gt;
{{Main|Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction}}
Some 21st century pop-science works, including ''[[The World Without Us]]'' by [[Alan Weisman]], pose an artistic [[thought experiment]]: what would happen to the rest of the planet if humans suddenly disappeared?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=He imagines a world without people. But why?|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2007/08/18/he_imagines_a_world_without_people_but_why/|accessdate=20 July 2016|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Neely|title=Depopulation Boom|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/07/AR2008030703256.html?hpid=artslot|accessdate=20 July 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=8 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A threat of human extinction, such as through a [[technological singularity]] (also called an intelligence explosion), drives the plot of innumerable science fiction stories; an influential early example is the 1951 film adaption of ''[[When Worlds Collide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barcella|first1=Laura|title=The end: 50 apocalyptic visions from pop culture that you should know about -- before it's too late|date=2012|publisher=Zest Books|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=978-0982732250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the extinction threat is narrowly avoided, but some exceptions exist, such as ''[[R.U.R.]]'' and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[A.I.

==Notes==
{{Refbegin}} &lt;!--
{{note|Putnam}} [[John von Neumann|Von Neumann]] said it was "absolutely certain (1) that there would be a nuclear war; and (2) that &lt;u&gt;everyone would die in it&lt;/u&gt;" (underline added to quote from: ''The Nature of the Physical Universe'' – 1979, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0-471-03190-9}}, in H. Putnam's essay ''The place of facts in a world of values'' - page 113). This example illustrates why respectable scientists are very reluctant to go on record with extinction predictions: they can never be proven right. (The quotation is repeated by Leslie (1996) on page 26, on the subject of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] annihilation, which he still considered a significant risk – in the mid 1990s.) --&gt;

{{note|unprecedented}} For research on this, see ''Psychological science'' volume 15 (2004): ''[http://www.psycho.unibas.ch/fakultaet/angewandt/articles/hertwig-psysci04.pdf Decisions From Experience and the Effect of Rare Events in Risky Choice]''. The under-perception of rare events mentioned above is actually the opposite of the phenomenon originally described by [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]] in "[[prospect theory]]" (in their original experiments the likelihood of rare events is overestimated). However, further analysis of the [[cognitive bias|bias]] has shown that both forms occur: When judging from ''description'' people tend to overestimate the described probability, so this effect taken alone would indicate that reading the extinction scenarios described here should make the reader overestimate the likelihood of any probabilities given. However, the effect that is more relevant to common consideration of human extinction is the bias that occurs with estimates from experience, and these are in the opposite direction: When judging from personal experience people who have never heard of or experienced their species become extinct would be expected to dramatically underestimate its likelihood. [[Sociobiologist]] [[E. O. Wilson]] argued that: "The reason for this myopic fog, evolutionary biologists contend, is that it was actually advantageous during all but the last few millennia of the two million years of existence of the [[genus]] Homo... A premium was placed on close attention to the near future and early reproduction, and little else. Disasters of a magnitude that occur only once every few centuries were forgotten or transmuted into myth." (Is Humanity Suicidal? ''The New York Times Magazine'' 30 May 1993).&lt;!--

{{note|HumanSelfDestructionCitation}} [http://www.abrupt.org/EDITORIAL/despair.html Abrupt.org 1996 editorial] lists (and condemns) the arguments for human's tendency to self-destruction. In this view, the [[history]] of humanity suggests that humans will be the cause of their own extinction. However, others have reached the opposite conclusion with the same data on violence and hypothesize that as societies develop armies and [[weapon]]s with greater destructive power, they tend to be used less often. It is claimed that this implies a more secure future, despite the development of [[Weapons of mass destruction|WMD]] technology. As such this argument may constitute a form of [[deterrence theory]]. Counter-arguments against such views include the following: (1) All weapons ever designed have ultimately been used. States with strong military forces tend to engage in military aggression, (2) Although modern states have so far generally shown restraint in unleashing their most potent weapons, whatever rational control was guaranteed by government monopoly over such weapons becomes increasingly irrelevant in a world where individuals have access to the technology of mass destruction (as proposed in ''[[Our Final Hour]]'', for example). --&gt;

{{note|PlanForDestruction}} [http://www.religioustolerance.org/destruct.htm ReligiousTolerance.org says that ''Aum Supreme Truth'' is the only religion known to have planned Armageddon for non-believers]. Their intention to unleash deadly [[virus]]es is covered in ''[[Our Final Hour]]'', and by [http://www.culteducation.com/reference/aum/aum276.html Aum watcher, Akihiko Misawa]. The [[Gaia Liberation Front]] advocates (but is not known to have active plans for) total human [[genocide]], see: [http://www.churchofeuthanasia.org/resources/glf/glfsop.html GLF, A Modest Proposal]. Leslie, 1996 says that Aum's collection of nuclear physicists presented a doomsday threat from nuclear destruction as well, especially as the cult included a rocket scientist.

{{note|Unbiased}} Leslie (1996) discusses the [[survivorship bias]] (which he calls an "observational selection" effect on page 139) he says that the ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' certainty of observing an "undisasterous past" could make it difficult to argue that we must be safe because nothing terrible has yet occurred. He quotes [[Holger Bech Nielsen]]'s formulation: "We do not even know if there should exist some extremely dangerous decay of say the proton which caused eradication of the earth, because if it happens we would no longer be there to observe it and if it does not happen there is nothing to observe." (From: Random dynamics and relations between the number of fermion generations and the fine structure constants, ''Acta Pysica Polonica B'', May 1989).
&lt;!--
{{note|BillJoy}} For example, in the essay ''Why the future doesn't need us'', computer scientist [[Bill Joy]] argued that human beings are likely to guarantee their own extinction through [[transhumanism]]. See: [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy_pr.html Wired archive, ''Why the future doesn't need us'']. --&gt;

{{note|2400}} For the "West Germany" extrapolation see: Leslie, 1996 (''The End of the World'') in the "War, Pollution, and disease" chapter (page 74). In this section the author also mentions the success (in lowering the birth rate) of programs such as the [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]]-for-[[Indian rupee|rupees]] programs in [[India]], and surveys other [[infertility]] or falling birth-rate extinction scenarios. He says that the voluntary small family behaviour may be counter-[[evolution]]ary, but that the [[meme]] for small, rich families appears to be spreading rapidly throughout the world. In 2150 the world population is expected to start falling.

{{note|AlienConquestUnlikely}} Former [[NASA]] consultant [[David Brin]]'s lengthy rebuttal to [[SETI]] enthusiast's optimism about alien intentions concludes: "The worst mistake of first contact, made throughout history by individuals on both sides of every new encounter, has been the unfortunate habit of making assumptions. It often proved fatal." ([http://www.setileague.org/iaaseti/brin.pdf See full text at SETIleague.org].)

The '''Intercontinental Le Mans Cup''' (shortened '''ILMC''') was an [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance]] [[sports car racing]] tournament organised by the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) started in 2010.&lt;ref name="Motorsport 20091208"&gt;[http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=353489 ACO links Le Mans series' with Intercontinental Cup]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - Motorsport.com, December 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The plans were first announced in June 2009&lt;ref name="Motorsport 20090611"&gt;[http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=331892&amp;FS=ALMS-LEMANS ACO adds trophies, expands driving school] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607213609/http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=331892&amp;FS=ALMS-LEMANS |date=2011-06-07 }} - Motorsport.com, June 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Autosport 20090611"&gt;[http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/76012 LMP1 teams urged into more series] - Autosport, June 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed in December of the same year.&lt;ref name="Motorsport 20091208" /&gt;

Both [[Le Mans Prototype|sports prototype]]s and [[LM GTE|grand tourer]]s were eligible to compete for the ILMC: the LMP1 and GTE classes each had a manufacturers cup, whereas all ACO classes had teams cups as long as there were at least four entries.&lt;ref name="Planet Le Mans 20100319"&gt;[http://www.planetlemans.com/2010/03/19/le-mans-intercontinental-cup-gt2-added/ Le Mans Intercontinental Cup – GT2 added!] - Planet Le Mans, March 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 also the GT1 class was eligible for the final time.

Peugeot was totally dominant winning 9 out of the 10 races during the two years.

For 2012, the ACO and the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] announced the creation of a new [[FIA World Endurance Championship]]. This championship would use similar rules to and would replace the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planetlemans.com/2011/06/03/fia-announces-world-endurance-championship/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The 2010 calendar comprised the [[1000 km Silverstone]] (Silverstone, United Kingdom, September 12), the [[Petit Le Mans]] (Road Atlanta, United States, October 2) and the 1000&amp;nbsp;km [[Zhuhai International Circuit|Zhuhai]] (Zhuhai, China, November 7).&lt;ref name="Planet Le Mans 20100610"&gt;[http://www.planetlemans.com/2010/06/10/the-aco-press-conference-a-look-at-the-future/ The ACO press conference – a look at the future!] - Planet Le Mans, June 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the 2011 calendar expanded to seven events. Along with the Silverstone (six-hour race) and Petit Le Mans races on similar dates, the championship started with the [[12 Hours of Sebring]] (Sebring, United States, March) before moving into Europe to contest a six-hour race at [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]] in Belgium on May, the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] (Le Mans, France, June 11–12), and another six hour race at the [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari|Imola]] circuit in Italy on July. The season finale was held in China on the [[Zhuhai International Circuit|Zhuhai]] circuit.&lt;ref name="SPEED TV 20101129"&gt;[http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/ilmc-road-atlanta-confirmed-on-2011-schedule/ ILMC: Petit Le Mans Confirmed For 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201020434/http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/ilmc-road-atlanta-confirmed-on-2011-schedule/ |date=2010-12-01 }} - SPEED TV, November 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Iraqi conflict (2003–present)''' is a long-running armed conflict that began with the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by a [[United States]]-led [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|coalition]] that toppled the [[Ba'athist Iraq|government of Saddam Hussein]]. However, the conflict continued as an [[insurgency]] emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq War|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/870845/Iraq-War|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States officially withdrew from the country in 2011, but became [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|re-involved in 2014]] at the head of a [[Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve|new coalition]].

==Background==
{{Main|Rationale for the Iraq War|Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations}}
The main rationale for the invasion of Iraq was based on [[United States|U.S.]] and [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] allegations that [[Saddam Hussein]] was developing [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] and that he thus presented a threat to his neighbors and to the world community. The U.S. stated "on November 8, 2002, the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] unanimously adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441|Resolution 1441]]. All fifteen members of the Security Council agreed to give Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its obligations and disarm or face the serious consequences of failing to disarm.

Throughout the early 2000s, the administrations of [[George W.

==Iraq War (2003–2011)==
{{Main|Iraq War}}

===2003 invasion===
{{Main|2003 invasion of Iraq}}
The invasion of Iraq lasted from 20 March to 1 May 2003 and signaled the start of the [[Iraq War]], which was dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RS21405.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion consisted of 21 days of major combat operations, in which a combined force of troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, [[Australia]] and [[Poland]] invaded [[Iraq]] and deposed the [[Ba'athist Iraq|Ba'athist government]] of [[Saddam Hussein]]. The invasion phase consisted primarily of a conventionally fought war which included the capture of the Iraqi capital of [[Baghdad]] by American forces with the implicit assistance of the United Kingdom alongside Australia and Poland.

160,000 troops were sent by the Coalition into Iraq, during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 19 March to 9 April 2003. About 130,000 were sent from the USA alone, with about 28,000 British soldiers, Australia (2,000), and Poland (194). [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|36 other countries]] were involved in its aftermath. In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 U.S. troops were assembled in [[Kuwait]] by 18 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/18/sprj.irq.deployment/index.html|title=U.S. has 100,000 troops in Kuwait |publisher=CNN |date=18 February 2003 |accessdate=29 October 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition forces also received support from [[Peshmerga|Kurdish irregulars]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].

The invasion was preceded by an [[airstrike]] on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on 20 March 2003. The following day, coalition forces launched an incursion into [[Basra Governorate|Basra Province]] from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While the special forces launched an amphibious assault from the [[Persian Gulf]] to secure [[Basra]] and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the [[Battle of Nasiriyah]] on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March, the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team|173rd Airborne Brigade]] was [[Operation Northern Delay|airdropped]] near the northern city of [[Kirkuk]], where they joined forces with [[Kurds|Kurdish]] rebels and fought several actions against the [[Iraqi Army]] to secure the northern part of the country.

The main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army, including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack and capture of [[Tikrit]] on 15 April. [[President of Iraq|Iraqi president]] Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On 1 May, an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion period and beginning the [[military occupation]] period.

===Anti-Coalition insurgency===
{{Main|Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|Iraqi insurgency (2003–06)}}
Invading U.S.-led forces were unable to immediately fill the power vacuum caused by the sudden collapse of a highly centralized state authority, resulting in weeks of virtual anarchy. The rampant looting during this time period, and the inability of U.S.-led forces to control the situation, led to Iraqi resentment. Additionally, the unexpectedly quick implosion of Saddam Hussein's regime meant that the invading forces never engaged and decisively defeated his army in any major battle; the Iraqi army forces simply melted away, often with their weapons, back to their homes. Another cause of resentment was the lack of immediate humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts for Iraqis suffering from the invasion, the long-term effects of the repression and mismanagement of the Saddam Hussein regime, and international sanctions.&lt;ref name="Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006"&gt;Abdullah, T.A.J., 2006, ''Dictatorship, Imperialism &amp; Chaos: Iraq since 1989'', London, Zed Books&lt;/ref&gt; A number of factions felt suspicious of long-term American intentions; the conduct of some American soldiers also served to heighten tensions.&lt;ref name="Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006"/&gt; The de-Ba'athification Commission set up by the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]], the nature of selection of the Governing Council, and other policy decisions were interpreted by Sunni Arabs as actions intended to single out their community for discrimination; this encouraged the beginnings of sectarian tensions.&lt;ref name="Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006"/&gt;

In May 2003, after the Iraqi conventional forces had been defeated and disbanded, the U.S. military noticed a gradually increasing flurry of attacks on U.S. troops in various regions of the so-called "[[Sunni Triangle]]", especially in [[Baghdad]] and in the regions around [[Fallujah]] and [[Tikrit]]. The U.S. military blamed the attacks on remnants of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]] and the [[Fedayeen Saddam]] militia. Tensions between U.S. forces and the residents of Fallujah were especially severe, with crowd riots and small skirmishes commonplace.

Members of insurgent groups came from a variety of sources. Former members of the security services of the Ba'ath regime, former military officers, and some other Ba'ath Party members are cited as members of insurgent groups; indeed, these elements formed the primary backbone of the nascent insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;Hashim, A.S., 2003, The Insurgency in Iraq, ''Small Wars and Insurgencies'', Volume 14(3), pp 1-22&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, most former members of the Ba'ath Party and former Iraqi soldiers expressed a willingness to compromise with the Coalition forces.  However, many lost their jobs and pensions with the [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order 2|disbanding of the Iraqi army]] by [[Paul Bremer]]; this, and the unwillingness of the Coalition Provisional Authority to negotiate with former Ba'ath elements, provided impetus for the initial insurgency. While 80% of the army officers were Sunni, the rank and file of the regular army was 80% Shia.&lt;ref&gt;Gaub, 2011, "Rebuilding Armed Forces: Learning From Iraq And Lebanon", ''Strategic Studies Institute'', pp 3&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners let out of prison by [[Saddam Hussein]] before his disappearance provided another source both of insurgent recruits and of organized crime factions.&lt;ref name="Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006"/&gt; Finally, as O'Hanlan says, the porous borders of Iraq and the subsequent foreign insurgents also bolstered the insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hanlan, M.E., 2005, Iraq Without A Plan, ''Policy Review'', Issue 128, pp 33-45&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance to U.S.-led forces would not for long be confined to the Sunni regions of Iraq. Between 2003 and 2004, Shiite dissatisfaction with the occupation, especially among the urban poor, had been gradually increasing for some of the same reasons it had been among the Sunnis: the perception that the Coalition had failed to deliver on its promises and a nationalist dissatisfaction with foreign occupation. Many young men without jobs or prospects and who had lost faith with the promises of the U.S. began to become drawn to Shiite religious radicalism, especially of the brand advocated by the cleric [[Muqtada al-Sadr]]. Sadr's distinguished family background, and his fiery anti-occupation rhetoric and calls for the implementation of [[Sharia|Islamic law]], caused him to emerge as the leader of this portion of Iraqi Shiite society. In June 2003, after being rejected from a spot on the Iraqi Governing Council, he had created a militia known as the [[Peace Companies|Mahdi Army]], whose mission he said was to help keep order and cleanse Iraq of "evil." Since that point, the U.S. had regarded him as a threat, but was divided on whether or not to proceed with a crackdown. Eventually, as Sadr's rhetoric heated and his militia paraded through Sadr City in what seemed like a challenge to the United States, they decided to begin to squeeze his movement. On March 29, they moved to close Sadr's newspaper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is Moqtada Sadr?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57949-2004Apr7.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as "al-Hawza" and arrested one of his aides on murder charges. That, combined with his steadily decreasing political prospects for success within the U.S.-backed interim government, pushed Sadr to decide for armed revolt.

On April 4, the Mahdi Army was directed to begin launching attacks on coalition targets and to seize control from the nascent U.S.-trained Iraqi security forces. The Mahdi Army, which by then numbered from 3,000 to 10,000 men, organized quickly escalating violent riots and then a coordinated assault, surprising coalition and Iraqi forces and seizing control of [[Najaf]], [[Kufa]], [[Kut|al-Kut]], and parts of Baghdad and southern cities like [[Nasiriyah]], [[Amarah]], and [[Basra]]. A widespread collapse of the Iraqi security forces ensued, with most deserting or defecting to the rebels rather than fighting. Soon, combat was erupting in many urban centers of southern and central portions of Iraq as U.S. forces attempted to maintain control and prepared for a counteroffensive.
		
At the same time, the Sunni insurgency was rapidly intensifying. On March 31, 2004, four [[private military company|private military contractor]]s working for the U.S. military were killed and subsequently mutilated by insurgents and a crowd of residents in the city of Fallujah, long a particularly troublesome center of Sunni resistance to the U.S. presence. On the same day, 5 U.S. soldiers were killed by a large IED on a road a few miles outside of the city. The attacks took place as the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] were taking over responsibility for [[Al Anbar Governorate|al-Anbar province]], in which Fallujah is located, from the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. The intended [[US Marine Corps|Marine]] strategy of [[patrolling|patrols]], less aggressive raids, [[humanitarian aid]], and close cooperation with local leaders was quickly suspended and the U.S. decided that it was time for a major assault to clear the city of insurgents. On April 4, U.S. and Iraqi forces launched [[First Battle of Fallujah|Operation Vigilant Resolve]] to retake the city, which had clearly fallen completely into rebel hands. They met very stiff and well-organized resistance from the guerrillas. After three days of fighting with the U.S. Marines, the insurgents still held three-quarters of the city. Cases of widespread reach and planning, suggesting national insurgent coordination, were noted. Hundreds of insurgents cut the road between Fallujah and Baghdad to the east, while west of Fallujah in [[Ramadi]], over 150 insurgents launched an offensive against U.S. Marine positions. A similar attack followed, conducted by about 150 insurgents, against U.S. Marines near the Syrian border in [[Al-Qa'im (town)|al-Qaim]]. The assaults were beaten back, but the U.S. toll from the combined attacks numbered in the dozens. Political pressure began to build on the United States and the Governing Council of Iraq as the hospital of Fallujah continued to report high numbers of civilian casualties, inflaming further the Iraqi people and Muslim world in general. After two weeks of fighting, the U.S. Marines were on the verge of capturing, but had not yet taken central control of, the city of Fallujah. Pentagon leaders, fearing that continuing the effort to capture the city might further inflame a larger revolt against Coalition authority, pulled back the forces. The Marines were ordered to stand-down and cordon off the city on April 30, where they would remain in a perimeter around the city for the following six months. A compromise on April 30 was reached in order to ensure security within Fallujah itself by creating the "Fallujah Brigade", a unit that drew from former members of Iraq's Army, local volunteers, and even the insurgents themselves. The unit's formation was part of a truce negotiation. This unit was to act under the control of the Coalition Provisional Authority, patrol alongside the Iraqi Police and National Guardsmen but maintain its autonomy. The Fallujah Brigade had many former Saddam loyalists. From various reports, Brigade members re-integrated themselves into the insurgent outfits that dominated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newstandardnews.net/content/?action=show_item&amp;itemid=977 Fallujah Brigade to Disband, Join Resistance in Control of City]&lt;/ref&gt; The city remained under the control of insurgent forces. Reportedly, [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]]'s organization was among the several that exercised some authority in the area.

By the end of the spring uprising, the cities of Fallujah, [[Samarra]], [[Baqubah|Baquba]], and Ramadi had been left under Sunni guerrilla control with American patrols in the cities ceased. The insurgency had undergone another major shift, as insurgent organizations now had safe havens in cities such as Fallujah to develop and coordinate with each other. Zarqawi's group and its allies were in a period of uneasy cooperation with other insurgent groups dominated by nationalist and Ba'athist agendas, although the groups increasingly came into competition for territory within Sunni insurgent-controlled areas. U.S. forces launched only occasional armored forays into Samarra and Baquba, while about half a dozen small forts were maintained by the U.S. Marines in Ramadi, with the surrounding territory in the city controlled by rebels. American ground forces remained outside of Fallujah, though regular air strikes were conducted on alleged safehouses of [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad|Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's followers]] in the city. With the battle for Fallujah over, the Sunni insurgency continued against the U.S. forces remaining outside these cities as the guerrillas resumed their tactics of using IED's and mortars to attack U.S. forces indirectly, for the most part avoiding direct combat.

Meanwhile, the fighting continued in the Shiite south. Over the next three months, over 1,500 Mahdi Army militiamen, several hundred civilians, and dozens of coalition soldiers were killed as the U.S. gradually took back the southern cities. On June 6, a truce was reached, temporarily ending the fighting.

On June 28, 2004, the occupation was formally ended by the Coalition, which transferred power to a new [[Politics of Iraq|Iraqi government]] led by [[Prime Minister of Iraq|Prime Minister]] [[Ayad Allawi]]. Although many Iraqis were optimistic about the government, militants saw it as little more than an American puppet and continued the fight unabated. On July 18, guerrillas offered a $285,000 reward for Allawi's assassination.

Bush|President Bush]] vetoed this bill, citing his concerns about setting a withdrawal deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/04/26/congress.iraq/index.html|title=Senate passes Iraq withdrawal bill; veto threat looms|date=26 April 2007|publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/05/01/congress.iraq/index.html|title=Bush vetoes war-funding bill with withdrawal timetable|date=2 May 2007|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/05/01/bush-vetoes-iraq-war-spending-bill/|title=Bush Vetoes Iraq War Spending Bill|date=1 May 2007|publisher=[[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bush Administration later sought an agreement with the Iraqi government, and in 2008 [[George W. Bush]] signed the [[U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement]]. It included a deadline of 31 December 2011, before which "all the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory".&lt;ref name="President Bush Whitehouse Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081214-2.html|title=President Bush and Iraq Prime Minister Maliki Sign the Strategic Framework Agreement and Security Agreement|date=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/122074.pdf|title=Agreement Between the United States of America and the Republic of Iraq On the Withdrawal of United States Forces from Iraq and the Organization of Their Activities during Their Temporary Presence in Iraq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/06/09/bush-admin-may-not-get-iraq-security-deal-before-end-term/|title=Bush Administration May Not Get Iraq Security Deal Before End Term|date=9 June 2008|publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last U.S. troops left Iraq on 18 December 2011, in accordance with this agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/us-troops-complete-their-withdrawal-from-iraq/story-e6frf7jx-1226225154019|title=US troops complete their withdrawal from Iraq|work=Herald Sun|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="President Bush Whitehouse Website"/&gt;&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State"/&gt;

The [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]'s (ISIS, ISIL) military campaign was very successful, and the group took swathes of territory in northern Iraq during 2014. Violence reached very high levels, with 1,775 people killed in the month of June alone. These figures remained very high for the remainder of the year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniraq.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=9155:un-casualty-figures-for-iraq-for-the-month-of-may-2018&amp;Itemid=633&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraqi–Kurdish conflict===
{{Main|2017 Iraqi–Kurdish conflict}}

The 2017 Iraqi–Kurdish conflict occurred in and around the [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish region]] of northern [[Iraq]] that began on 15 October 2017, shortly after the [[Iraqi Kurdistan independence referendum, 2017|Iraqi Kurdistan referendum in 2017]] was held on September 25. After the independence referendum, Prime Minister [[Haider al-Abadi]] demanded the referendum to be canceled. In October, the Iraqi military moved into the Kurdistan region after the entry of [[ISIL|Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]. On 16 October 2017, the Kurdish [[Peshmerga]] ignored a deadline given by Iraq to withdraw. This led to  [[Battle of Kirkuk (2017)]], and Iraqi forces and Iranian-backed PMU retaking Kirkuk and its province on 15 October 2017. Within 15 hours, the city of [[Kirkuk]] and the nearby [[K-1 Air Base]], along with surrounding oilfields, were retaken by Iraqi forces. This resulted in the conflict's end.

===Defeat of ISIL===
On December 9, 2017, the last ISIL-held areas in the al-Jazira Desert were captured by the Iraqi military. The prime minister later declared victory, and celebrations occurred soon after.

==ISIL insurgency (2017–present)==
{{Main|Iraqi insurgency (2017-present)}}
Following ISIL's defeat, the group has continued an insurgency. However they have been greatly weakened and violence in Iraq has been sharply reduced in 2018. Only 95 people lost their lives during the month of May, the lowest figure in 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdobs.com/archive/featured/violence-in-iraq-at-lowest-level-in-10-years/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2018''' was the sixteenth annual [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest]], organised by the [[National State Television and Radio Company of the Republic of Belarus|Belarusian Television and Radio Company]] (BTRC) and the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU). It took place in the [[Belarus]]ian capital city, [[Minsk]] on 25 November 2018 at the [[Minsk-Arena]].&lt;ref name="Host"/&gt; It was the second time that the contest was held in Belarus, after it staged the {{Escyr|2010|Junior|2010 edition}} at the same venue.

A record twenty countries took part in the contest, with {{Esccnty|Kazakhstan|Junior}} and {{Esccnty|Wales|Junior}} participating for the first time. {{Esccnty|France|Junior}} returned for the first time since {{Escyr|2004|Junior}}, alongside {{Esccnty|Azerbaijan|Junior}} for the first time since {{Escyr|2013|Junior}} and {{Esccnty|Israel|Junior}} after missing the {{Escyr|2017|Junior|2017 edition}}. {{Esccnty|Cyprus|Junior}} withdrew from the contest. 

The winner was [[Roksana Węgiel]], who represented {{Esccnty|Poland|Junior|y=2018}} with the song "[[Anyone I Want to Be]]". This was Poland's first win in the junior contest and the eighth time they have won a [[Eurovision_(network)#Events|Eurovision event]], the last being [[Eurovision Young Dancers 2017]] in [[Prague]]. {{Esccnty|France|Junior|y=2018}} came second, their best result at the contest, while {{Esccnty|Australia|Junior|y=2018}} placed third for the second year in a row. {{Esccnty|Kazakhstan|Junior|y=2018}} was the best performing debuting nation, finishing sixth, whilst {{Esccnty|Wales|Junior|y=2018}} came last.

The EBU confirmed on 15 October 2017, that the contest would be hosted by Belarus.&lt;ref name="Host Country"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=271012|title=Minsk announced as the host city for Junior Eurovision 2018!|work=Junior Eurovision Song Contest|access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will be the second time Belarus hosts the Junior Eurovision Song contest, after hosting the {{Escyr|2010|Junior}} contest.

On 21 November 2017, Belarus' Deputy Prime Minister Vasily Zharko confirmed that the contest was scheduled to be held at [[Minsk-Arena]] in November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.belta.by/president/view/zharko-to-head-organizing-committee-for-2018-junior-eurovision-song-contest-106940-2017/|title=Zharko to head organizing committee for 2018 Junior Eurovision Song Contest|website=eng.belta.by|date=21 November 2017|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena previously hosted the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010 contest]]. However, on 26 November 2017, it was confirmed by the host broadcaster that the exact location of the contest is still unknown, stating that Minsk Arena was one of the possible options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tvr.by/news/kultura/minsk_gotovitsya_vo_vtoroy_raz_prinyat_detskoe_evrovidenie_/|title=Минск готовится во второй раз принять детское "Евровидение"|publisher=BTRC|language=be|trans-title=Minsk prepares for the second time to host a children's Eurovision Song Contest|date=26 November 2017|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 March 2018, the 15,000-capacity Minsk-Arena was confirmed as the venue by the contest organisers.&lt;ref name=Host&gt;{{cite web|url=https://junioreurovision.tv/story/junior-eurovision-2018-to-take-place-in-minsk-arena-november-25|title=Junior Eurovision 2018 to take place on Sunday 25th November!|website=junioreurovision.tv|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=18 March 2018|date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
===Visual design===
The slogan was the hashtag ''#LightUp''. The logo of the contest was based around a morning star made of vertically inverted soundwaves. The source of inspiration was the artistic potential and creative aspiration of the young participants who fill the scene like a star.&lt;ref name=Host/&gt;

===Hosts===
[[File:Hosts of JESC 2018.jpg|thumb|The hosts during dress rehearsal]]
On 26 October 2018, it was announced that [[Evgeny Perlin|Eugene Perlin]] and Zinaida Kupriyanovich would host the contest, together with Helena Meraai in the green room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eurovoix.com/2018/10/27/junior-eurovision18-helena-meraai-will-be-the-green-room-host/|title=Junior Eurovision’18: Helena Meraai Will Be The Green Room Host|last=Granger|first=Anthony|date=27 October 2018|work=Eurovoix|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meraai is the fourth person under the age of sixteen to ever host the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, after Ioana Ivan in {{Escyr|2006|Junior}}, Dmytro Borodin in {{Escyr|2009|Junior}} and [[Lizi Pop|Lizi Japaridze]] in {{Escyr|2017|Junior}}, and is also the second former participant to host an edition of the contest.

Perlin is a television presenter and the country's Eurovision commentator since 2013, whilst Kupriyanovich is a singer and artist who has participated in Belarus' national selections for the 2015 and 2016 Junior Eurovision Song Contests. It was also announced that Denis Dudinsky and Anna Kviloria will host the opening ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zwart|first1=Josianne|title=Meet the hosts of Junior Eurovision 2018!|url=https://junioreurovision.tv/story/meet-the-hosts-of-junior-eurovision-2018|website=junioreurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=26 October 2018|date=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting===
The results were determined by national juries and an online audience vote. Every country used a national jury that consisted of three music industry professionals and two kids aged between 10 and 15 who were citizens of the country they represent. The first phase of the online voting started on 23 November 2018 when a recap of all the rehearsal performances were shown on the official website before the viewers could vote. Following this recap, voters had the option to watch longer one-minute clips from each participant’s rehearsal. This first round of voting ended on 25 November at 15:59 CET. The second phase of the online voting took place during the live show and started after the last performance and was open for 15 minutes. International viewers could vote for a minimum of three countries and a maximum of five, including their own country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Voting in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest|url=Junior Eurovision’18: Details of Voting Revealed/|work=Eurovoix|date=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of points were determined by the percentage of votes received. The public vote counted for 50% of the final result, while the other 50% came from the professional juries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://junioreurovision.tv/story/start-voting-now-minsk-2018|title=Junior Eurovision fans: Cast your vote online!|publisher=junioreurovision.tv|date=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trophy===
The trophy was designed by Kjell Engman of the Swedish glass company [[Kosta Glasbruk|Kosta Boda]], using the same design as was first introduced in the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2017|2017 contest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurovoix.com/2018/11/24/junior-eurovision-winners-trophy-revealed/|title=Junior Eurovision: Winners’ Trophy Revealed|date=24 November 2018|publisher=Eurovoix|last=Walker|first=Evan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main trophy is a glass microphone with colored lines inside the upper part, which symbolize the flow of sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Junior Eurovision 2017 Trophy Revealed|url=https://eurovoix.com/2017/11/21/junior-eurovision-2017-trophy-revealed/|work=Eurovoix|date=21 November 2017|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a country to be eligible for potential participation in the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest]], it needs to be an active member of the EBU.&lt;ref name="Eligibility"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.ebu.ch/sites/ebu/contents/programming/tv/tv-groups/junior-eurovision-song-contest-s.html|title=Junior Eurovision Song Contest steering group|last=Yakovlev|first=Vladislav|date=23 January 2014|publisher=EBU|accessdate=26 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528005833/http://www3.ebu.ch/sites/ebu/contents/programming/tv/tv-groups/junior-eurovision-song-contest-s.html|archivedate=28 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently unknown whether the EBU issue invitations of participation to all 56 active members like they do for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].

* {{Esc|Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina|Junior}} – On 25 May 2018, the Bosnian broadcaster [[Radio and Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (BHRT) stated that they would not be allowed to debut at the contest in the near future until the debt-related sanctions placed on them by the EBU are lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eurovoix.com/2018/05/25/bosnia-herzegovina-bhrt-barred-from-competing-in-eurovision-contests/|title=Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina: BHRT Barred From Competing in Eurovision Contests|first=Anthony|last=Granger|date=25 May 2018|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Esc|Denmark|Junior}} – On 16 February 2018, it was reported that the EBU is calling on Danish broadcaster [[DR (broadcaster)|Danmarks Radio]] (DR) to return to Junior Eurovision after an 11-year break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christian|last=Ellegaard|url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/kultur/film/grand-prix-boss-vil-have-danmark-tilbage-i-omdiskuteret-boerneshow|title=Grand Prix-boss vil have Danmark tilbage i omdiskuteret børneshow|trans-title=Grand Prix boss wants Denmark back in disputed children's show|publisher=DR|language=Danish|date=16 February 2018|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Lagermand Lundme, the head of Entertainment at the Danish broadcaster, however played down the likelihood of Denmark returning to the competition; saying "Now, never say never, but as long as the show is, as it is now, I’m definitely not going to compete again. The values that we put in Denmark in a program for children do not match the values of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest… It seems that the children are on stage and play adults instead of acting as children, and we think that is fundamentally wrong. Children must be children, they should not try to strive to be something they are not. It’s super bad for us, because we really wanted to be part of the show. Participating in a concept like Junior Eurovision would be a natural step for us after MGP, but it does not work when we do not feel the show fits the Danish values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurovoix.com/2018/02/17/denmark-ebu-wants-see-countries-return-junior-eurovision/|title=Denmark: EBU Wants To See Country’s Return to Junior Eurovision|date=17 February 2018|publisher=Eurovoix|last=Granger|first=Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Esc|Lithuania|Junior}} – On 28 February 2018, the Lithuanian broadcaster [[Lithuanian National Radio and Television]] (LRT) declared that they wouldn't return to contest in the near future. LRT executive producer Audrius Giržadas stated that "this contest has become a clone of the main Eurovision Song Contest and has nothing to do with childhood, little girls go on stage with clipped hairs, glued eyelashes and bare belly, copying [[Beyoncé]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] – this is not an event that we would like to participate in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Miglė|last=Dauskurdienė|url=http://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/tavo-lrt/37/204494/klausiate-atsakome-kodel-lrt-nebedalyvauja-vaiku-eurovizijoje/|title=Klausiate – atsakome.

* {{Esc|United Kingdom|Junior}} – On 2 January 2018, the Belarusian broadcaster [[National State Television and Radio Company of the Republic of Belarus]] (BTRC) announced that a representative from an unknown British broadcaster would be attending the supervisory meeting for the 2018 contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eurovoix.com/2018/01/02/united-kingdom-representative-attend-junior-eurovision-meeting/|title=United Kingdom: Representative to Attend Junior Eurovision Meeting|date=2 January 2018|work=Eurovoix|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later it was confirmed that the United Kingdom will not take part in the Steering Group meetings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37225">[[File:Leeds1984.png|right|thumb|500px|Map of the results for the 1984 Leeds council election.]]

The '''[[Leeds City Council]] elections''' were held on Thursday, 3 May 1984, with one third of the council to be elected. In the interim there had been a by-election in [[Armley (ward)|Armley]] to replace the incumbent councillor [[Michael Meadowcroft]] after he was elected the [[Leeds West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds West]] MP, resulting in an [[SDP-Liberal Alliance|Alliance]] hold.

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative's]] downward trend continued after [[Leeds City Council election, 1983|last year's]] respite to a new party low, resulting in a 3% swing to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]. In contrast, the Alliance support stabilised after the prior year's fall to retain a healthy proportion of their initial [[Leeds City Council election, 1982|1982 surge]]. Despite the swing towards them, Labour finished the night with a net loss, as the Alliance won the only remaining [[Burmantofts]] seat they did not hold from them. The Alliance also gained in [[Moortown, Leeds|Moortown]], winning their first seat in the ward from the Conservatives - who lost another in [[Pudsey]] South to their former incumbent turn [[Independent (politician)|Independent]], achieving the feat of first elected Independent onto the council.&lt;ref name="results"&gt;{{cite news |title=District results: Leeds |work=[[The Yorkshire Post]] |page= |date=4 May 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Market foreclosure''' is the exclusion that results when a downstream buyer is denied access to an upstream [[Vendor (supply chain)|supplier]] (caused from an Upstream foreclosure) or when an upstream supplier is denied access to a downstream buyer.&lt;ref&gt;Stefanadis, C: "Downstream Vertical Foreclosure and Upstream Innovation", Journal of Industrial Economics, 1997, https://www.jstor.org/pss/2950611&lt;/ref&gt; A supplier or intermediary in a [[supply chain]] can acquire this form of [[market power]] through [[mergers and acquisitions]] up and down its value chain ([[vertical integration]]).

== Description ==
[[Vertical integration]] does not always carry the danger of foreclosure. Hortacsu and Syverson reviewed plant and market data in the US cement and concrete industries over a 34-year span; they found that vertical integration lead to lower prices and higher quantities for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ali Hortaçsu]] and Chad Syverson:"Cementing Relationships: Vertical Integration, Foreclosure, Productivity, and Prices", JPE 2007, http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/514347&lt;/ref&gt;

This is contrary to what one would expect in a market experiencing foreclosure by players with market power. Similarly, a review of exclusive dealing practices in the [[Chicago]] beer market by Asker fails to show foreclosure effects.&lt;ref&gt;John Asker:"Diagnosing Foreclosure due to Exclusive Dealing", http://www.johnasker.com/AskerBeer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, an examination of media markets showed that integrated operators are likely to exclude rival program services, and attempt to increase the [[Barriers to entry|barrier to entry]] in the market. Thus, effectively blocking some program services from the distribution networks of vertically integrated cable system operators.&lt;ref&gt;Chipty, Tasneem: "Vertical Integration, Market Foreclosure, and Consumer Welfare in the Cable Television Industry", AER 2001(June)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
For example, in industries like gasoline refining, distribution, and retail; it is possible to argue that a vertically-integrated refiner reduces competition through practices that constrain supply to retailers outside its network of related firms. Some researchers have suggested that US wholesale gasoline prices may be inflated by 0.2 to 0.6 cents per gallon due to the market power wielded by vertically integrated players in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;Aydemir, Z: "Estimating Vertical Foreclosure in U.S. Gasoline Supply", https://ideas.repec.org/p/soz/wpaper/0212.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=November 2013}}
A '''moving violation''' is any violation of the law committed by the [[driving|driver]] of a [[vehicle]] while it is in [[motion (physics)|motion]]. The term "motion" distinguishes it from other motor vehicle violations, such as paperwork violations (which include violations involving automobile insurance, registration and inspection), [[parking violation]]s, or equipment violations.

== Types ==
While some violations, like parking violations, are civil matters involving a vehicle's owner, moving violations are charged against the actual driver.

Moving violations are usually classified as [[infraction]]s or [[misdemeanor]]s, but serious violations such as [[hit and run (vehicular)|hit and run]], [[driving under the influence]], and [[road rage]] can be considered [[felony|felonies]].

== Costs ==
Moving violations involve fines which must be paid as well and sometimes punitive ''points'' assessed to the license of the driver. As a driver accumulates points, he or she may be required to attend defensive driving lessons, re-take his or her driving test, pay additional taxes, or even surrender his or her license.  Additionally, drivers with more points on their driving record often must pay more for [[car insurance]] than drivers with fewer.

Sometimes tickets are used in a [[speed trap]] as a form of fundraising. For example, a local government that is suffering a budget shortfall may ticket more aggressively within its jurisdiction to increase revenue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/DN-sherifftraffic_17met.ART0.North.Edition1.4ddc526.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/072308dnmetsheriffbudget.7ea14cec.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/26942504.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918091107/http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/26942504.html |date=September 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], citation fines can vary widely between jurisdictions for the same behaviour, usually between [[USD|$]]25 and $1000. In countries such as [[Finland]], however, they are specific proportions of the violator's income, and fines in excess of $100,000 can be assessed to wealthy individuals. In [[Canada]], each province is individual in how they treat similar behaviour and each violation usually includes a set fine and [[demerit point]]s against the driver's license. For example, a speeding ticket in Ontario of 50+ km over is 6 demerit points against the driver's licence with the approximate fine calculated as (km over x 9.75) x 1.25, as well it carries a one-week automatic licence suspension and car impoundment. In Manitoba speeding in excess of 49&amp;nbsp;km is 8 demerit points and a fine of 557 dollars.

==Examples of moving violations==
*speeding, which can be exceeding a [[Speed limit|limit]] or (in some jurisdictions) simply driving at an unsafe speed
*[[tailgating]] or failing to maintain an [[assured clear distance ahead]] (ACDA)
*running a [[stop sign]] or red [[traffic light]]
*failure to yield to another vehicle with the [[Traffic#Priority_(right_of_way)|right-of-way]]
*failure to [[Turn signal|signal]] for turns or lane changes
*improper [[lane]] usage, such as failing to drive within a single lane
*crossing over a center divider, [[Central reservation|median]] or [[gore (road)|gore]]
*driving on the [[hard shoulder|shoulder]] where it is considered illegal under certain conditions
*failure to use a [[seat belt]]
*illegal use of [[Window film|window tints]] and obstructions
*failure to stop for a [[pedestrian]] in a [[crosswalk]]
*failure to stop for a [[school bus]] when children are boarding or exiting (in certain jurisdictions)
*failure to secure a load to a [[truck]] or lorry
*driving in a [[high-occupancy vehicle lane|car pool lane]] illegally
*operating a telecommunications device while driving (in jurisdictions that prohibit [[Texting while driving|this]])
*driving a vehicle outside the conditions of one's license
*driving without a license or with a suspended license or with a license from another country
*driving a vehicle in a [[bus lane]] or tracks
*failure to stop after a [[traffic collision]] or make a report


More serious moving violations include:
*[[driving under the influence]]
*[[reckless driving]]
*[[street racing]]
*[[vehicular homicide]]

The '''Museum of Hoaxes''' is a [[website]] created by Alex Boese in 1997 in [[San Diego]], [[California]] as a resource for reporting and discussing [[hoax]]es and [[urban legends]], both past and present.&lt;ref&gt;Emery, David, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2002/12/19/aboese.DTL ''"The Bunk Stops Here: An interview with Alex Boese, curator of the Museum of Hoaxes"''], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], December 19, 2002 (URL last accessed November 1, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berman, A.

In 2004, PC Magazine included the site as one of the "Top 100 Sites You Didn't Know You Couldn't Live Without,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federatedmedia.net/authors/hoaxes ''"Museum of Hoaxes" (advertiser profile)''], [[Federated Media Publishing Inc|Federated Media Publishing]], URL last accessed November 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1558713,00.asp ''"The Museum of Hoaxes"''], [[PC Magazine]], April 20, 2004 (URL last accessed November 1, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and Sci Fi Weekly named it "site of the week" for the week beginning 7 February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Dellamonica, A.

Boese has published two books on hoaxes: ''Museum of Hoaxes'' ([[E.P. Dutton]], 2002, {{ISBN|0-525-94678-0}}) and ''[[Hippo eats dwarf|Hippo Eats Dwarf]]: A Field Guide to Hoaxes and Other B.S.'' (Harvest Books, 2006, {{ISBN|0-15-603083-7}}). A third book by Boese, ''Elephants on Acid'' (Harvest Books, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-15-603135-6}}), focuses on unusual scientific experiments. His latest book is ''Electrified Sheep'', published by Boxtree 2011, is also about strange scientific experiments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7092">A '''music competition''' is a public event designed to identify and award outstanding [[musical ensemble]]s, [[solo (music)|soloists]] and musicologists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artparking.org/en/ The Center for New Technologies in the Arts "Art-parkING", Annual Musicology Competition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200509/http://artparking.org/en/ |date=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop music competitions are music competitions which are held to find [[pop starlets]]. Examples of music competitions include [[Open Mic UK]], [http://www.soundwavemusiccompetition.com/ SoundWave Music Competition], [[All-Japan Band Association]] annual contest, the World Music Contest, [[Live and Unsigned]], the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], and ''[[American Idol]].''

==History==
The European Classical art music idiom has long relied on the institution of music competitions to provide a public forum that identifies the strongest young players and contributes to the establishment of their professional careers (see [[List of classical music competitions]]). Popular instrumental ensembles such as [[brass bands]] and [[school band]]s have also long relied on competitions and festivals to promote their musical genres and recognize high levels of achievement. In recent decades large competitions have also developed in the field of popular music to showcase performances by pop vocalists and rock bands (e.g. "[[Idol series]]" and "[[Battle of the Bands]]" events).

==Examples==
The music [[competition]]s with the largest [[audience]]s are widely [[television|televised]] events in the [[genre]] of [[popular music]], such as the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] and ''[[American Idol]]''. The [[Open Mic UK]] and [[Live and Unsigned]] contests in the [[United Kingdom]] each garner approximately 10,000 contestants annually, making them the largest contests in the region.&lt;ref name="winnerseleven"&gt;{{cite news

According to 2005 statistics, more than 650,000 visitors attend the [[World Music Contest]] (Kerkrade, the Netherlands), which has 19,000 contestants from over 30 countries, making it one of the largest competitions in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmc.nl/home.aspx?id=35 World Music Contest (Kerkrade, the Netherlands)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002103328/http://www.wmc.nl/home.aspx?id=35 |date=2013-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[All-Japan Band Association]] annual contest appears to be the world's largest music competition in terms of the number of active [[contestant]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, D.

In 643 or years of 22 [[Hijr]], After the conquest of Rayy and Central Persia, Umar ordered the conquest of [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azarbaijan]]. The [[Rashidun]] Caliphate continued the conquest towards Azerbaijan first under the force of [[Mughira ibn Shu'ba|Al Mughirah bin Shubah]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=fRjsrA5tfLIC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=azerbaijan+643&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L-q4VJmeKJeLuATvmYDoCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=azerbaijan%20643&amp;f=false The History of al-Tabari Vol. 14: The Conquest of Iran A.D. 641-643/A.H. 21-23]&lt;/ref&gt; this was also reported by Abu Jafar (Tabari) which quoting the report from Ahmad bin Thabit al Razi.

==Battles==
Later at some points Umar appointed Hudheifa to the command of the campaign against [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azarbaijan]]. Hudheifa first marched to Zanjan. Here the local garrison put up resistance but they were overpowered and the city was conquered. From Zanjan the Muslim forces proceeded to [[Ardabil]] where The Persians in here did not offer any resistance and surrendered on the usual terms of Jizya. From Ardabeel the Muslim forces marched northward along the western coast of the [[Caspian Sea]]. There was a confrontation at Bab area which was an important port on the Caspian Sea. This time the Muslims also scored a victory but for unknown circumstances at this stage Hudheifa was recalled. The Persians launched a counterattack causing Muslims abandoned their forward posts in Azarbaijan, as a response Umar now sent the expeditionary forces to Azarbaijan, one led by [[Bukair ibn Abdullah]] and the other by Utba bin Farqad. The contingent under Bukair had their first confrontation with the Persians at Jurmizan. The Persians were commanded by Isandiar. In the battle which was quite severe, the Persians were defeated and their commander Isandiar was captured alive. Isandiar asked Bukair, "Do you prefer war or peace?" Bukair said that the Muslims preferred peace. Isandiar thereupon said, "Then keep me with you till I can help you in negotiating peace with the people of Azarbaijan". There were many forts in the hills. The Persians went to these hills and shut themselves in the forts. The Muslims captured the entire area in the plains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alim.org/library/biography/khalifa/content/KUM/18/pdf/52 Khalifa Umar bin al-Khattab - Expansion of Islam and Military Campaigns Conquest Of Azarbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years of 25 Hijr in Islamic Calendar, the Mushaf Uthmani of Quran was created in attempt to avoid linguistic confusion of Qur'an which translated to local dialect of Azerbaijan and Armenia. Hudhaifa warned Uthman that the newly translated Qur'an would lose its original Tafseer if it didn't standardized in original Mushaf or version first before the local could translate and give commentary of Quran interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=9_tPRiD9XFEC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=hudhaifa+azerbaijan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hva4VKeGNITkuQTJpYDQBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=hudhaifa%20azerbaijan&amp;f=false Sejarah The Holy Quranic Text By Mustafa Al-Azami quoting the History of Mushaf Uthmani]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

[[Bukair ibn Abdullah]], who had recently subdued Azerbaijan, was assigned a mission to capture [[Tiflis]]. From Bab at the western coast of the Caspian Sea, Bukair continued his march north. Umar decided to practice his traditional and successful strategy of multi-pronged attacks. While Bukair was still miles away from [[Tiflis]], Umar instructed him to divide his army into three corps. Umar appointed [[Habib ibn Muslaima]] to capture Tiflis, [[Abdulrehman]] to march north against the mountains and [[Hudheifa]] to march against the southern mountains. Habib captured Tiflis and the region up to the eastern coast of the [[Black Sea]]. Abdulrehman marched north to the [[Caucasus|Caucasus Mountains]] and subdued the tribes. Hudheifa marched south-west to the mountainous region and subdued the local tribes. The advance into Armenia came to an end with the death of Caliph Umar in November 644. By then almost the whole of the South [[Caucasus]] was captured.&lt;ref&gt;The Muslim Conquest of Persia By A.I. Akram. Ch:16 {{ISBN|978-0-19-597713-4}},&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services''''', {{ussc|523|75|1998}}, was a decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].  The case arose out of a suit for sex discrimination by a male oil-rig worker, who claimed that he was repeatedly subjected to [[sexual harassment]] by his male co-workers with the acquiescence of his employer.  The Court held that Title VII's protection against [[workplace discrimination]] "because of... sex" applied to [[harassment]] in the [[Workplace harassment|workplace]] between members of the same sex.

==Background==
In late October 1991, Joseph Oncale was working for Sundowner Offshore Services on a [[Chevron USA|Chevron USA Inc.]] oil platform in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. He was employed as a [[roustabout]] on an eight-man crew. On several occasions, Oncale was forcibly subjected to sex-related, humiliating actions against him by his coworkers in the presence of the rest of the crew. Oncale was also [[sodomy|sodomized]] with a bar of soap and threatened with rape. Oncale's complaints to supervisory personnel produced no remedial action. Instead, the company's Safety Compliance Clerk called him a name suggesting homosexuality. Oncale eventually quit, asking that his pink slip reflect that he "voluntarily left due to sexual harassment and [[verbal abuse]]."

Oncale filed a complaint against Sundowner in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana]], alleging that he was discriminated against in his employment because of his sex. Relying on earlier precedents, the district court granted summary judgment to the defendant: "Mr. Oncale, a male, has no cause of action under Title VII for harassment by male co-workers." Oncale appealed, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] affirmed the decision. After granting a petition for [[writ of certiorari]], the Supreme Court reversed the decision.

==Decision==
Justice Scalia, writing for the unanimous court (with Justice Thomas concurring), reversed the decision of the district court and remanded the case for further proceedings in accordance with the instruction that a male can be discriminated against by members of the same sex under Title VII.

''Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services'' set the precedent for analyzing same-sex harassment and sexual harassment without motivation of "sexual desire" by stating that any discrimination based on sex is actionable if it places the victim in an objectively-disadvantageous working condition, regardless of the gender of the victim or the harasser.

The application of the ''Oncale'' case has caused some difficulty in the lower federal courts, which have struggled with how to determine whether any particular case of same-sex harassment is "because of sex." In particular, courts have struggled with how to deal with harassment that appears to be based on actual or perceived [[sexual orientation]] because employment discrimination based on sexual orientation was not explicitly forbidden by federal law.

In July 2015, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] determined that employment discrimination based on sexual orientation was illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and used the ''Oncale'' decision as a basis''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Thank Scalia for the Revolutionary EEOC Workplace Discrimination Decision|url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/07/17/scalia_and_the_eeoc_how_oncale_made_sexual_orientation_discrimination_illegal.html|newspaper = Slate|date = 2015-07-17|access-date = 2015-07-17|issn = 1091-2339|language = |first = Mark Joseph|last = Stern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it set a precedent regarding harassment "because of sex," ''Oncale v. Sundowner'' has been lauded as a landmark gay rights case, even though all those involved were heterosexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/OncaleVsSundowner.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070119013300/http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/OncaleVsSundowner.html |archivedate=2007-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6578">The '''Pottery Barn rule''' is an American expression alluding to a policy of '''"you break it, you bought it"''' or '''"you break it, you buy it"''' or '''"you break it, you remake it"''', by which a retail store holds a customer responsible for damage done to merchandise on display. It generally "encourages customers to be more careful when handling property that's not theirs". It is an analogy often used in the political or military arena to suggest that if an actor inadvertently creates a problem, the actor is obliged to provide the resources necessary to correct it.&lt;ref name="slate.com"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/07/28/if_you_break_it_do_you_really_have_to_buy_it_.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The phrase "If you break it, you've bought it" was reportedly first used in 1952 by a Miami Beach gift shop, who posted the message over their fragile merchandise.&lt;ref name="slate.com"/&gt;

Individually operated furnishing stores selling fragile goods (art, pottery, and sculptures) often post a "you break it, you buy it" sign. According to legal experts, 'If the sign is big enough, and prominently displayed, it can be argued that you were given what lawyers call "sufficient notice"' and 'In this case, just by entering the store you agree to the terms of the sign, even if you didn't read it'. In addition, it is the customer's responsibility to be careful in a premises with lots of fragile valuable goods; so careless behavior such as an untied shoelace or horsing around can be regarded as negligent. However the rule is rarely enforced, as the establishment cannot detain a customer for non-payment of damages and instead would have to file a civil suit against that customer. In actual practice even a civil suit is unlikely if the patron lacks the means to pay, such as damaged artwork in a museum that could be worth millions.&lt;ref name="slate.com"/&gt;

In reality, [[Pottery Barn]]—a chain of upscale home furnishing stores in the United States—does not have a "you break it, you bought it" policy,&lt;ref name="crm"&gt;{{cite web | author=Daniel Grant| year=2005 | title=You Break It, You Buy It? Not According to the Law |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207233337/http://www.craftsreport.com/april05/break_not_buy.html |archivedate=December 7, 2006 | url=http://www.craftsreport.com/april05/break_not_buy.html| work=[http://www.craftsreport.com/ The Crafts Report Magazine] | accessdate=18 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but instead [[Write-off|writes off]] broken merchandise as a loss, as do most large American retailers.&lt;ref name="sptimes"&gt;{{cite web | author=Helen Huntley| year=2004 | title=Rule that isn't its rule upsets Pottery Barn | url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/04/20/Business/Rule_that_isn_t_its_r.shtml| work=[http://www.sptimes.com/ St. Petersburg Times] | accessdate=18 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal doctrine also holds that a retailer incurs the risk that merchandise will be destroyed by placing it where customers can handle it and not doing anything to discourage them.&lt;ref name="crm"/&gt;

==Political usage==
''[[New York Times]]'' columnist [[Thomas L. Friedman]] claims to have coined the term, having used the phrase "the pottery store rule" in a February 12, 2003, column. He has said he referred to Pottery Barn specifically in speeches.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Citation

According to ''[[Washington Post]]'' journalist [[Bob Woodward]], [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] cited the rule in the summer of 2002 when warning [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] of the consequences of his planned [[Second Iraq War|military action in Iraq]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"You are going to be the proud owner of 25 million people," he told the president. "You will own all their hopes, aspirations, and problems. You'll own it all." Privately, Powell and [[Deputy Secretary of State]] [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]] called this the Pottery Barn rule: You break it, you own it.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;{{cite book | last = Woodward | first = Bob | authorlink = Bob Woodward | title = [[Plan of Attack]] | year = 2004 | pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Powell confirmed the quotation on [[Jonathan Dimbleby]]'s ''Jonathan Dimbleby'' program on April 30, 2006.

[[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] presidential candidate [[John Kerry]] cited the rule and attributed it to Powell in debating Bush on policy on the Iraq war during [[2004 Presidential Debates#First presidential debate .E2.80.94 September 30|the first debate of the 2004 Presidential election]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;KERRY: Secretary of State Colin Powell told this president [Bush] the Pottery Barn rule: If you break it, you fix it. Now, if you break it, you made a mistake. It's the wrong thing to do. But you own it. And then you've got to fix it and do something with it. Now that's what we have to do. There's no inconsistency. Soldiers know over there that this isn't being done right yet. I'm going to get it right for those soldiers, because it's important to Israel, it's important to America, it's important to the world, it's important to the fight on terror.

The {{Nihongo|'''Racial Equality Proposal'''|人種的差別撤廃提案|Jinshutekisabetsu teppai teian|lead=yes|extra=lit. "Proposal to abolish racial discrimination"}} was an amendment to the treaty under consideration at the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] offered by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. The racial equality proposal was never intended to have any universal implications.{{sfn|Shimazu|1998|p=114}} Foreign Minister Uchida stated in June 1919 that the racial equality proposal was not intended to demand universal racial equality of all coloured peoples, but only for members of the [[League of Nations]].{{sfn|Shimazu|1998|p=114}} Though broadly supported, it did not become part of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], largely because of the opposition of [[Australia]] and the [[United States]], two powers with long established de jure and de facto systems of racial discrimination and policies of White Supremacy. Its rejection led to the alienation of Japan from the other great powers and increased nationalism leading up to [[World War II]]. The principle of [[racial equality]] would be revisited after the Second World War and be incorporated into the [[United Nations Charter]] in 1945 as the fundamental principle of international justice. Despite that several countries, including the two aforementioned powers would retain officially sanctioned racial laws and policies for decades afterwards.

==Background==
Japan attended the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]] as one of the five great powers, and as the only non-Western great power.{{sfn|Shimazu|1998|p=1}} For the Japanese, it was the culmination of a half century of an intensive national effort to create a modern state. The presence of Japan delegates in the [[Hall of Mirrors]] at [[Versailles]], signing the [[Treaty of Versailles]] on 28 June 1919 was a truly astonishing feat; only fifty years prior, it would have been impossible to imagine the Japan that was reflected in 1919. Japan had become very much part of the international scene.{{sfn|Shimazu|1998|p=1}}

===Japanese domestic politics===
Prime Minister [[Hara Takashi]] had come into power in September 1918, he was determined that Japan should adopt a {{Nihongo|pro-western foreign policy|欧米協調主義|ōbei kyōchō shugi}} at the forthcoming peace conference in Versailles.{{sfn|Shimazu|1998|p=38}} This was largely in consequence to the previous [[World War I|wartime]] governments under Prime Ministers [[Ōkuma Shigenobu]] and [[Terauchi Masatake]] following expansionist policies, which had the effect of alienating Japan from the United States and Britain.{{sfn|Shimazu|1998|p=38}} Hara was determined to support the creation of the League of Nations at the peace conference, in order to steer Japan back to the West.{{sfn|Shimazu|1998|p=38}} However, there was a not insignificant degree of scepticism expressed towards the League in Japan. Domestically, opinion was divided into those who supported the League and those who opposed it, with the latter being more representative of {{Nihongo|national opinion|国論|kokuron}}.{{sfn|Shimazu|1998|p=39}} Hence, the proposal had the role of appeasing these opponents by making Japan's acceptance of the League conditional on having a racial equality clause inserted into the covenant of the League.{{sfn|Shimazu|1998|p=39}}

After the end of seclusion in the 1850s, Japan signed [[unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] (the so-called [[Ansei Treaties]]) but soon came to demand equal status with the Western powers. Correcting inequality became the most urgent international issue of the Meiji government. In this context, the Japanese delegation to the Paris peace conference proposed the "racial equality clause" in the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]]. The first draft was presented to the League of Nations Commission on 13 February as an amendment to Article 21:
{{Quote|The equality of nations being a basic principle of the League of Nations, the High Contracting Parties agree to accord as soon as possible to all alien nationals of states, members of the League, equal and just treatment in every respect making no distinction, either in law or in fact, on account of their race or nationality.}}

In a speech, the Japanese diplomat [[Makino Nobuaki]] stated that during the war men of different races had fought together on the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] side, leading to say: "A common bond of sympathy and gratitude has been established to an extent never before experienced."{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=318}} The Japanese delegation did not realize the full ramifications of their proposal, since its adoption would have challenged aspects of the established norms of the (Western dominated) international system of the day, which involved the colonial rule over non-[[white people]]s. The intention of the Japanese was to secure equality of their nationals and the equality for members of the League of Nations;{{sfn|Shimazu|1998|p=114}} however, a universalist meaning and implication of the proposal became attached to it within the delegation, which drove its contentiousness at the conference.{{sfn|Shimazu|1998|p=115}}

Lord [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Robert Cecil]] stated after Makino's speech that the Japanese proposal was a very controversial one and he suggested that perhaps the matter was so controversial that it should not be discussed at all.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=318}} The Greek Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] also suggested that a clause banning religious discrimination should also be removed as that was also a very controversial matter, which led to objections from a Portuguese diplomat who stated that his country had never signed a treaty before that did not mention God, which caused Cecil to remark perhaps this time they would all just have to a take a chance that they would avoid the wrath of the Almighty by not mentioning Him.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=318}} Cecil removed all references to clauses that forbade racial and religious discrimination from the text of the peace treaty, but the Japanese made it clear that they would seek to have the racial equality clause restored.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=318}} By this time, the racial equality clause was beginning to draw widespread public attention. Demonstrations in Japan demanded the end of the "badge of shame" as policies to exclude Japanese immigration in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand received much media attention in Japan.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=318}} In the United States, the racial equality clause received much negative media coverage, especially on the Pacific coast and in the South, though for different reasons.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=318}} The Chinese delegation that was otherwise at daggers drawn with the Japanese over the question of who was receive the former German colony of Qingdao together with the rest of the German concessions in Shandong province also said that they would support the racial equality clause.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=318}} However, one Chinese diplomat said at the time that the Shandong question was far more important to his government than the racial equality clause.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=318}}

Australian Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]] clarified his opposition and announced at a meeting that "ninety-five out of one hundred Australians rejected the very idea of equality."&lt;ref name="PaulGordonLauren1988p90c"&gt;Kajima, Diplomacy of Japan p. 405  as cited in [[Racial Equality Proposal#refLauren1988|Lauren 1988]],  p.&amp;nbsp;90&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes had entered politics as a trade unionist, and like most of the Australian working class was very strongly opposed to Asian immigration to Australia (excluding Asian immigration was a popular cause with unions in Canada, the U.S, Australia, and New Zealand in the early 20th century). Hughes believed that accepting the Racial Equality clause would mean the end of the [[White Australia]] immigration policy that had been adopted in 1901, writing: "No Gov't could live for a day in Australia if it tampered with a White Australia".{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=319}} Hughes stated: "The position is this-either the Japanese proposal means something or it means nothing: if the former, out with it; if the latter, why have it?"{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=319}} The New Zealand Prime Minister [[William Massey]] also came out in opposition to the Racial Equality Clause, though not as voraciously as Hughes.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=319}}

Then, [[Makino Nobuaki]], the career diplomat who headed the Japanese delegation, announced at a press conference: "We are not too proud to fight but we are too proud to accept a place of admitted inferiority in dealing with one or more of the associated nations. We want nothing but simple justice."&lt;ref name="PaulGordonLauren1988p90a"&gt;Japan, Delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, Documents Distributed to the Public, "Interview du Baron Makino, 2 April 1919", located at the Hoover Institution. "Japan May Bolt World League" ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 3 April 1919.  as cited in [[Racial Equality Proposal#refLauren1988|Lauren 1988]],  p.&amp;nbsp;90&lt;/ref&gt; France declared its support for the racial equality proposal as the French position had always been that French language and culture was a "civilizing" force open to all regardless of skin color.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=319}} The British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] found himself in an awkward situation: Britain had signed an alliance with Japan in 1902, but at the same time, Lloyd George wanted to hold the British Empire delegation together.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=319}} The South African Prime Minister General [[Jan Smuts]] and the Canadian Prime Minister Sir [[Robert Borden]] tried to work out a compromise, visiting Nobuaki and [[Chinda Sutemi]] and Hughes, serving as mediators.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=319}} Borden and Smuts were able to arrange a meeting between Nobuaki, Chinda and Hughes which ended badly. The Japanese diplomats wrote that Hughes was a vulgar "peasant", loud and obnoxious while Hughes complained that the Japanese had been "beslobbering me with genuflexions and obsequious deference".{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=319}} However, Borden and Smuts were able to persuade Hughes to accept the Racial Equality Clause provided it was declared that the clause did not affect immigration.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=319}} Nobuaki and Chinda in their turn rejected the compromise.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=319}}    

The proposal was also problematic for U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who needed the votes of [[racial segregation|segregationist]] [[Southern Democrats]] to succeed in getting the votes needed for the [[U.S. Senate]] to ratify the treaty.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Strong opposition from the [[British Empire]] delegations gave him a pretext to reject the proposal.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==April 11==
On April 11, 1919, the commission held a final session.{{sfn|Lauren|1988|p=90}} Makino stated the Japanese plea for human rights and racial equality.{{sfn|Lauren|1988|p=91}} British representative [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Robert Cecil]] spoke for the British Empire and addressed opposition to the proposal.{{sfn|Lauren|1988|pp=91-92}} [[Italian Prime Minister]] [[Vittorio Orlando]] spoke in favor of the statement on [[human rights]].{{sfn|Lauren|1988|p=92}} [[Senate of France|French Senator]] [[Léon Bourgeois]] urged adoption and stated that it would be impossible to reject this proposal that embodied "an indisputable principle of justice".&lt;ref name = "PaulGordonLauren1988p92b"&gt;Conférence de paix de Paris, 1919-1920, ''Recueil des actes de la Conférence'', "Secret," Partie 4, pp. 175-176. as cited in [[#refLauren1988|Lauren 1988]],  p.&amp;nbsp;92&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal received a majority vote on the day.{{sfn|Lauren|1988|p=90}} Eleven of the seventeen delegates present voted in favor of its amendment to the charter, and no negative vote was taken. The votes for the amendment tallied thus:

* [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] (2) Yes
* [[French Third Republic|France]] (2) Yes
* [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] (2) Yes
* [[First Brazilian Republic|Brazil]] (1) Yes
* [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]] (1) Yes
* [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] (1) Yes
* [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] (1) Yes
* [[Czechoslovakia]] (1) Yes
Total: 11 Yes

* [[British Empire]] (2) - Not Registered
* [[United States]] (2) - Not Registered
* [[First Portuguese Republic|Portugal]] (1) - Not Registered
* [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] (1) - Not Registered
* [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgium]] (2) - Absent{{sfn|Shimazu|1998|pp=30-31}}

The chairman, President Wilson, overturned it, saying that although the proposal had been approved by a clear majority, that in this particular matter, strong opposition had manifested itself (despite the lack of any actual votes ''against'' the proposal{{sfn|Shimazu|1998|pp=30-31}}), and that on this issue a unanimous vote would be required. This strong opposition came from the British delegation.{{sfn|Temperley|1924|p=352}} French Delegate Ferdinand Larnaude immediately stated "A majority had voted for the amendment".&lt;ref name = "PaulGordonLauren1988p93"&gt;Conférence de paix de Paris, 1919-1920, ''Recueil des actes de la Conférence'', "Secret," Partie 4, p. 177. as cited in [[#refLauren1988|Lauren 1988]],  p.&amp;nbsp;93&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese delegation wanted the transcript to show that a clear majority had been voted for the amendment to the Charter.&lt;ref name = "PaulGordonLauren1988p93"/&gt;

Though the proposal itself was compatible with British stance of equality for all subjects as a principle for maintaining imperial unity, there were significant deviations in the stated interests of its Dominions, notably Australia. As it risked undermining the [[White Australia Policy]], then Prime Minister of Australia Billy Hughes and [[Joseph Cook]] vigorously opposed the proposal behind the scenes, and so advocated against it through the British delegation. Without the support of its Dominions, the British delegation could not take such a stand on principle. According to Robert Cecil, the delegate representing the British Empire at the Conference, in his diary:
{{Quote|...it is curious how all the foreigners perpetually harp on principle and right and other abstractions, whereas the Americans and still more the British are only considering what will give the best chance to the League of working properly.&lt;ref name = "Shimazu1998p119"&gt;Diary, 4 February 1919, Add.51131, f.33, ''Cecil Papers'', as cited in [[Racial Equality Proposal#refShimazu1998|Shimazu 1998]],  p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt;}} To placate Japan, Wilson promised to support the Japanese claims on the former German possessions in China, saying that this would be Japan's reward for accepting the rejection of the racial equality proposal.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=321}} Furthermore, over the advice of his navy, Wilson also agreed to support Japanese claims to the Marianas, Marshall and Caroline islands in the Pacific (which Japan had occupied in 1914), though as mandates that Japan would administer on behalf of the League of Nations, instead of allowing the Japanese to annex the islands outright as they had wanted.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|pp=315-316}} In May 1919, the peace conference formally decided that Japan would receive the Carolines, Marshall and the Marianas as Class C League of Nations mandates.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=316}} During the 1920s, the Japanese violated the terms of the mandates by preventing representatives of the League from visiting the islands, by bringing in settlers on the islands, and by building military bases, most notably at [[Chuuk Lagoon#World_War_II|Truk]], which became the main Japanese naval base in the Pacific.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=316}} The Canadian historian [[Margaret Macmillan]] noted that some of the islands that Japan had been awarded in 1919 to peacefully develop became the scenes for famous battles in World War II, most notably [[Operation Hailstone|Truk]], [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]], and [[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]].{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=316}}

==Reaction==
In the end, Cecil felt that British support for the League of Nations was a more crucial goal. The Japanese media fully covered the progress of the conference, leading to an alienation of Japanese public opinion towards the United States of America, leading to broader conflicts later on. In the United States, [[Red Summer of 1919|racial riots]] resulted from the American deliberate inaction.{{sfn|Lauren|1988|p=99}} Although the exclusion of the racial equality proposal allowed Wilson to keep Southern Democratic allies on his side, this proved insufficient to get the treaty ratified by the [[United States Senate]], and the United States never joined the League of Nations. The mood of the international system changed dramatically by 1945, so that this contentious point of racial equality would be incorporated into the [[United Nations Charter]] in 1945 as the fundamental principle of international justice.

As such, some historians consider that this point could be listed among the many causes of conflict and which led to Japanese actions later on. They argue that the rejection of the racial equality clause proved to be an important factor in turning Japan away from cooperation with the West and toward [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] policies.{{sfn|Macmillan|2007|p=321}} In 1923, the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]] expired, which gradually resulted in a closer relationship of Japan to Germany and Italy. However, Prussian militarism was already entrenched in the Imperial Japanese Army, many members of the Army had expected Germany to win the war, and Germany had approached Japan for a separate peace in 1916. The rapprochement towards Germany did not occur until the mid-1930s, a time when Germany had greater [[Sino-German cooperation (1911–1941)|ties with Nationalist China]].

After the [[Nazis]] gained power in Germany, Japan decided to not expel [[Shanghai ghetto|Jewish refugees]] from China, Manchuria, and Japan&lt;ref name=mof&gt;{{cite web | title=Question 戦前の日本における対ユダヤ人政策の基本をなしたと言われる「ユダヤ人対策要綱」に関する史料はありますか。また、同要綱に関する説明文はありますか。| publisher = [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan]] | url = http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/annai/honsho/shiryo/qa/senzen_03.html |accessdate = 2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gosho&gt;{{cite web | title = 猶太人対策要綱 | work = Five ministers council | publisher = [[National Archives of Japan|Japan Center for Asian Historical Record]] | url = http://www.jacar.go.jp/DAS/meta/listPhoto?IS_STYLE=default&amp;ID=M2006092115064531921 | page = 36/42 | date = 1938-12-06 | accessdate = 2010-10-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726042931/http://www.jacar.go.jp/DAS/meta/listPhoto?IS_STYLE=default&amp;ID=M2006092115064531921 | archivedate = 2011-07-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and advocated the political slogan [[Hakkō ichiu]] (literally "eight crown cords, one roof" i.e. "all the world under one roof").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3488">'''Secretary-General's Internal Review Panel (IRP) on United Nations Action in Sri Lanka''' or '''Independent Review Panel on Sri Lanka'''  is an internal  [[United Nations]] review panel headed by [[Charles Petrie (diplomat)|Charles Petrie]]. The Panel produced a report (Internal Review Panel Report or Petrie report) that describes a "systemic failure" of [[United Nations]] action during the Final Stages of the [[Alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War|Sri Lankan Civil War]] including the withdrawal of UN staff in September 2008 which removed the 'protection by presence' capacity of the United Nations, shortly before months of intense armed conflict that left tens of thousands of dead. The report suggested that more than 70,000 people may have been killed during approximately the last 6 months of the conflict. The report concludes with a series of recommendations on how the United Nations can strengthen its protection of human rights in similar situations in the future. The report was presented to United Nations Secretary General [[Ban Ki Moon]].

'''''Sex''''' is a [[coffee table book]] written by American singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], with photographs taken by [[Steven Meisel|Steven Meisel Studio]] and film frames shot by [[Fabien Baron]]. The book was edited by [[Glenn O'Brien]] and was released on October 21, 1992, by [[Hachette Book Group USA|Warner Books]], [[Maverick (company)|Maverick]] and [[Callaway Arts &amp; Entertainment|Callaway]] Books. Approached with an idea for a book on erotic photographs, Madonna expanded on the idea and conceived the book and its content. Shot in early 1992 in New York City and [[Miami]], the locations ranged from hotels and burlesque theaters, to the streets of Miami. The photographs were stolen before publishing, but were quickly recovered.

The book had a range of influences, from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts such as [[Guy Bourdin]], [[Helmut Newton]] and [[Robert Mapplethorpe]]. ''Sex'' has photographs that feature adult content and [[Softcore pornography|softcore pornographic]] as well as simulations of sexual acts, including [[sadomasochism]]. Madonna wrote the book as a character named "Mistress Dita", inspired by 1930s film actress [[Dita Parlo]]. It also includes cameos by actress [[Isabella Rossellini]], rappers [[Big Daddy Kane]] and [[Vanilla Ice]], model [[Naomi Campbell]], gay porn star [[Joey Stefano]], actor [[Udo Kier]], socialite [[Princess Tatiana von Fürstenberg]], and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares.

The packaging for the book is made of aluminium, which was Madonna's idea, and is spiral bound and enclosed in a Mylar sheet. Due to the scandalous nature of the photographs and the media mayhem surrounding it from the initial preview of the book, Madonna did not have to promote ''Sex'', except for a pre-release party and some television specials. Her publishers were extremely apprehensive about the release as well as its commercial potential. ''Sex'' was released alongside her fifth studio album ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'', which went on sale a day earlier.

The book was an instant commercial success, managing to sell over 150,000 copies on its first day of release and topping the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. It was received negatively by both critics and fans of the singer, who felt she had "gone too far."  Through the years, however, critical reception towards ''Sex'' has become more positive, with academics deeming it a defining phase in Madonna's career. ''Sex'' is noted for its impact on society and culture as well as on Madonna herself, and is considered a bold, [[post-feminism|post-feminist]] work of art. The book has since become one of the most sought-after out-of-print books ever released and still remains the fastest-selling coffee table book of all time.

== Background and development ==
According to Giselle Benatar of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', there are two versions of how Madonna came up with the idea for the book. One was that she conceived the idea of an erotic photography book during the shooting of the film ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' in the summer of 1991.&lt;ref name="Sex and money" /&gt; The second one is that [[Judith Regan]], vice-president and [[editor-in-chief]] of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], flew to Los Angeles in March 1991 to meet with Madonna and her manager [[Freddy DeMann]], armed with a proposal for a similar collection of photo-erotica.&lt;ref name="Sex and money" /&gt; The singer had initially verified whether Regan had approached any other celebrities with this concept, as Madonna would be interested to be a part of it only if it was a unique idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2008|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the meeting Madonna had agreed "in principle" to do a book called ''Madonna's Book of Erotica and Sexual Fantasies''. She told Regan that DeMann would call her and work out the details regarding the book.&lt;ref name="Tarabo 222" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Time For The Gift-giving Season: Madonna Gets Bookish About|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=October 7, 1992|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-10-07/entertainment/9203310949_1_madonna-book-warner-books-miss-america|accessdate=September 18, 2011|first=Michael|last=Kilian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007050158/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-10-07/entertainment/9203310949_1_madonna-book-warner-books-miss-america|archivedate=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Madonna never got back in touch with Regan, who assumed that the singer did not want to proceed with the idea.&lt;ref name="Sex and money" /&gt; Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg never confirmed nor denied Regan's claim, but according to Benatar, Madonna started working on ''Sex'' before wrapping up ''A League of Their Own''.&lt;ref name="Sex and money" /&gt; At first [[Warner Bros. Records]] and the executive directors at [[Time Warner]] were reluctant to allow Madonna to publish such a book, but finally gave in to the idea. Madonna, however, was forced to sign a contract that forbade her from showing [[child pornography]], [[bestiality]] and [[religious image]]ry.&lt;ref name="Sex and money" /&gt; Not long after signing this agreement Madonna founded [[Maverick (company)|Maverick]], a multi-media entertainment company. Since by contract she had total artistic control over any of the work released by Maverick, the agreement she signed with Time Warner concerning what not to do in ''Sex'' became obsolete.&lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas Mc"&gt;{{harvnb|McMahon|2000|pp=702–705}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times Warner"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/20/arts/madonna-makes-a-60-million-deal.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm|title=Madonna Makes a $60 Million Deal|date=April 20, 1992|accessdate=December 14, 2012|first=Holden|last=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Holden|work=[[The New York Times]]|pages=1–2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524065239/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/20/arts/madonna-makes-a-60-million-deal.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm|archivedate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sex'' book had a range of influences—from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts like [[Guy Bourdin]] and his surrealism, and [[Helmut Newton]], in its stylized, sado-masochistic look.&lt;ref name="brien238"&gt;{{harvnb|O'Brien|2008|pp=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also influenced by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]]'s infamous three-part ''XYZ'' portfolio, particularly the ''X'' portfolio, with Madonna even having considered the latter as a title during the formative stages of ''Sex''.&lt;ref name="Cross 57"&gt;{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kellner"&gt;{{harvnb|Kellner|1995|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs from [[Brassaï]]'s 1933 book ''Paris de nuit'' (''Paris by Night'') also inspired several of the book's series of images.&lt;ref name="Cross 57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kellner"/&gt; Madonna changed her mind about the title being ''X'', when [[Spike Lee]]'s film ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]'' began to be promoted (the film was released three weeks after the book). She would go on to tell ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine: "We were gonna call it ''X'' [...] but then the whole thing with the Malcolm X movie started. At first I thought, 'Fuck it, it's a really good symbol and I thought of it first'. But I realized it might be confusing or look like I was copying Spike [Lee]. Besides, Sex is almost as powerful: it's universal, it doesn't need translation - and it's only two letters more than X."&lt;ref name="Courant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.courant.com/1992-10-21/features/0000110977_1_gutenberg-bible-madonna-s-new-album-encore-books|title=You Can Tell This Book By Its Cover|date=October 21, 1992|accessdate=December 1, 2012|first=Catlin|last=Roger|work=[[Hartford Courant]]|pages=1–2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105124754/http://articles.courant.com/1992-10-21/features/0000110977_1_gutenberg-bible-madonna-s-new-album-encore-books|archivedate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros. commented that ''Sex'' was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many different printing and publishing companies.&lt;ref name="tres" /&gt; They also stated that in order to generate any profit, the book would have to sell at least 350,000 copies.&lt;ref name="DigitalSpy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Girl EW" /&gt; Madonna hired top-notch talent for the development of the book;&lt;ref name="Cross 57"/&gt; she counted on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry.&lt;ref name="tres" /&gt; The singer hired [[Fabien Baron]] as the art director,&lt;ref name="Fabien Baron the"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1992/11/29/fabien-baron-s-grand-designs.html|title=Fabien Baron's Grand Designs|date=November 29, 1992|accessdate=December 13, 2012|first=Jones|last=Malcolm|work=The Daily Beast|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130411230917/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1992/11/29/fabien-baron-s-grand-designs.html|archivedate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; fashion photographer [[Steven Meisel]], editor [[Glenn O'Brien]], make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco.&lt;ref name="Sex and money" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas Mc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times dos" /&gt; Madonna originally wanted the book to be of an oval shape in order to simulate a [[condom]] but the printing and manufacturing of such a book would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: "Madonna and I can keep up with each other" and that "I'm doing things to make people think too. It's not really to antagonize or to push people's buttons. It's really to present another way of seeing things."&lt;ref name="Sex and money" /&gt;

The pictures were taken almost entirely in [[Super 8 film|Super 8]] format, and most of the photo shoots took place in New York City and [[Miami]]. Locations in New York City included the [[Hotel Chelsea]] and Times Square's all-male burlesque [[Gaiety Theatre, New York (male burlesque)|Gaiety Theatre]] (dancers from theatre participated in one of the book's photo sessions), whereas in Miami the majority of the sessions were shot at a house Madonna had purchased just before starting the project, and in several beaches and streets.&lt;ref name="Sex and money" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chelsea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseahotelblog.com/living_with_legends_the_h/rock_roll/|title=You Can Tell This Book By Its Cover|accessdate=December 14, 2012|work=[[Hotel Chelsea]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211043928/http://www.chelseahotelblog.com/living_with_legends_the_h/rock_roll/|archivedate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One morning during the four-day Florida shoot Madonna was prancing around her 14-bedroom house in Miami completely naked, when someone jokingly suggested she go out on the street, then, according to Baron "the next thing we're in the street" where allegedly "cars screeched to a halt, motorists whistled, and one entranced cyclist fell off his bike."&lt;ref name="Sex and money" /&gt; This was just one of the many crazy episodes that took place during the shooting of the book. According to Baron, during the photo shoots "[Madonna]'d do something crazy and then we'd come up with something even crazier". One of the most shocking photographs made for the book, which featured two women in [[post-punk]] attire flanking Madonna with one of them holding a knife to Madonna's crotch, was dismissed as it was considered too violent. At some point, while the book was being produced, some of the photographs were stolen, but were quickly recovered by the [[FBI]].&lt;ref name="Sex and money" /&gt; According to ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, there were approximately 80,000&amp;nbsp;photographs taken for the book,&lt;ref name="Nyissue" /&gt; but only a handful made the final cut.&lt;ref name="Sex and money" /&gt; The printing of the book was extended for 15&amp;nbsp;days&lt;ref name="The Girl EW" /&gt; making the total production process last about eight months.&lt;ref name="Tarabo 224" /&gt;

(consisting of Fabien Baron and the photographer Siung Fat Tjia) who had previously collaborated with the singer designing the cover art of her fifth studio album, ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]''.&lt;ref name="The Girl EW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fabien Biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bernhardtdesignpress.com/downloads/BaronBio03_25_03.pdf|title=Fabien Baron Biography|accessdate=December 14, 2012|first=Baron|last=Fabien|publisher=BernhardtDesignPress.com|pages=1–2|format=PDF|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324130040/http://www.bernhardtdesignpress.com/downloads/BaronBio03_25_03.pdf|archivedate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this was the first project for Maverick, the packaging was crucial; however Madonna did not have faith in Warner Book's "mass-market" publication process. Hence Baron suggested to transfer the packaging job to [[Nicholas Callaway]]'s bespoke Callaway Editions.&lt;ref name="brien240" /&gt; Charles Melcher, co-publisher with Callaway for the book, said that they usually did "exquisite art books, $100 high end, beautiful things". But it was a challenge for them to process Madonna's ideas into reality. The artist wanted the packaging to be sealed, so that the reader had to tear it up and read.&lt;ref name="brien240" /&gt; They considered various kinds of clasps before zeroing on the idea of the sealed bag as a reference to a condom package. The metal cover was Madonna's idea, who took the inspiration from the 1979 album, ''[[Metal Box]]'' by the band [[Public Image Ltd]].&lt;ref name="brien241" /&gt; Melcher recollects, "We were talking about materials for the cover, and we went into her kitchen. [Madonna] pointed at the metal plate at the back of her stove and said, 'I want something like this'. I was very impressed with the way she interacted with her world to source things."&lt;ref name="brien241"&gt;{{harvnb|O'Brien|2008|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company bought about {{convert|1,500,000|lb|kg}} of aluminium, a pound for each book. The designers had to do the front and the back covers, while rolling, stamping and ionizing the metal.&lt;ref name="brien241" /&gt;

The book opens up with the introduction: "Everything you are about to see and read is a fantasy, a dream, pretend".&lt;ref name="EW 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,365681,00.html|title=The Naked Launch|date=October 25, 2002|accessdate=November 30, 2012|first=Kirschling|last=Gregory|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115134604/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,365681,00.html|archivedate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout ''Sex'', Madonna offers poems, stories, and essays.&lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-10-18/features/9202240139_1_madonna-big-book-orders|title=Madonna She's Got Sex For Our Eyes And Erotica For Our Ears.|date=November 5, 1992|accessdate=December 12, 2012|first=Deborah|last=Wilker|work=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|pages=1–2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222042606/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-10-18/features/9202240139_1_madonna-big-book-orders|archivedate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also uses the [[pseudonym]] "Mistress Dita" as a homage to German actress [[Dita Parlo]]; her friends in these stories are Bunny, Dex, Stella, Chiclet and Stranger.&lt;ref name="Tarabo 222"&gt;{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2008|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McNair" /&gt; According to biographer J.

== Release and promotion ==
The initial preview of the book was met with a huge amount of controversy, as it showed a nude Madonna wearing a rabbit's tail, shaving the [[pubic hair]] of a naked man, and cavorting outdoors with a dog, suggesting [[zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref name="Courant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nyissue" /&gt;  [[The Holy See|The Vatican]] urged its people to boycott the release, saying that it was "morally intolerable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LA&amp;p_theme=la&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EF617A7CABA631F&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=How Far Can She Go?|date=October 11, 1992|accessdate=June 8, 2013|work=Daily News of Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian customs officials said that the book offended the country's public morality.

Madonna then said she was "doing this to liberate America — free us all of our hang-ups".&lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel" /&gt; She told ''Spin'' magazine "We live in a very repressed society, and I deal with erotic themes. The point I try to make is: Why should we feel ashamed of our sexuality?".&lt;ref name="Bob" /&gt; Later she revealed that "[This book] does not condone unsafe sexual practices".&lt;ref name="Tarabo 222" /&gt; Nicholas Callaway from [[Callaway Arts &amp; Entertainment]] said that the book  was "inevitably going to be controversial. The book explores every aspect of sexual fantasy. It's hard to calculate the effect, [but], ''Sex'' should be considered 'art'".&lt;ref name="Chicago Tr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-10-07/entertainment/9203310949_1_madonna-book-warner-books-miss-america|title=In Time For The Gift-giving Season: Madonna Gets Bookish About|date=October 7, 1992|accessdate=December 13, 2012|first=Kilian|last=Michael|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007050158/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-10-07/entertainment/9203310949_1_madonna-book-warner-books-miss-america|archivedate=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally it was rumored that [[Time Warner]] was nervous about the release of the book; however, in an interview with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', William Sarnoff, president of Warner Books, said he felt that Madonna "should pursue all avenues of creativity as she defines it". The Warner company had also previously assured that they would make sure ''Sex'' reached its main [[target audience]] and also reminded that the book was safely wrapped in a Mylar bag to prevent in-store peeping and contained a warning label.&lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel" /&gt; [[Michael Kilian]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' published an article on October 7, 1992, regarding the then upcoming release of ''Sex'': "Prepare thyself, [...], The mega-event of the millennium is to occur in precisely two weeks. It's an event far more mega than the November election, the collapse of communism or even the crowning of [[Leanza Cornett]] as the new [[Miss America]]." Kilian also described it as the "personal sexual fantasy picture book in all Christendom, then it goes far beyond all previous 'truly twisted' personal sexual fantasy picture books—perhaps beyond all imagining what such a book could be".&lt;ref name="Chicago Tr" /&gt;

On October 15, Madonna threw a pre-release party at New York City's Industria Superstudio, and signed all the invitations under her ''Sex'' [[alter ego]] "Dita".&lt;ref name="Vogue It"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.it/en/people-are-talking-about/from-new-york/2011/03/industria-superstudio-anniversary|title=Industria Anniversary|date=March 29, 2011|accessdate=December 12, 2012|first=D'Annunzio|last=Grazia|work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Signed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.julienslive.com/view-auctions/catalog/id/26/lot/7299/|title=Madonna Signed Invitation|accessdate=December 10, 2012|first=Darren|last=Julien|publisher=[[Julien's Auctions]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701170111/http://www.julienslive.com/view-auctions/catalog/id/26/lot/7299/|archivedate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the party, Madonna showed up dressed as [[Little Bo Peep]] and even carried with her a stuffed toy lamb.&lt;ref name="TI" /&gt; Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg showed concern at first due to "what the parents of America's impressionable teens will soon be thinking" but later said that it "all depends on your idea of lovemaking, which in Madonna's case, should give new meaning to the word erotic".&lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel" /&gt; Both [[Waldenbooks]] and [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] prepared corporate statements that the managers could share with customers who are offended by ''Sex''. (Both statements defended the right of bookstores to provide "diversity and choice" to customers and say censorship is not the role of bookstores.)&lt;ref name="Courant dos" /&gt; Many book stores, too, stated that the book would not be sold to anyone under 18 and that it would be for display only behind the cash register.&lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Courant dos" /&gt; Bookstore owner David Epstein stated that "The feeling of most people who have ordered the book is that Madonna is something special, that this is cutting-edge art, [...], they're not the kind of people who are buying it because it's smut and dirty pictures. People are interested in it as art."&lt;ref name="Courant dos" /&gt;

''Sex'' was finally released on October 21, 1992 – one day after Madonna's  fifth studio album ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'' –  by editorials Callaway and [[Warner Books]];&lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times dos" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago Tr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times one" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times two" /&gt; it was the first work released by Madonna's company Maverick.&lt;ref name="Sex and money" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel" /&gt; A [[comic book]] titled ''Dita in The Chelsea Girl'' was included in the book. Also included was a promotional single titled "Erotic" with the CD packaging representing a condom wrapper.&lt;ref name="Cross 57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kellner"/&gt; The track "Erotic" featured a stripped-down arrangement of the song "[[Erotica (song)|Erotica]]" that offered an alternate vocal take not used in the album version. With an initial print run of one million copies of the first edition in five continents and in five languages,&lt;ref name="New York Times two" /&gt; the price of the book was $50 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50|1992}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) at retail, making sex an "expensive visual book".&lt;ref name="Chicago Tr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times one"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/19/business/the-media-business-edging-into-madonna-s-limelight.html?scp=3&amp;sq=madonna%20sex&amp;st=cse|title=The Media Business; Edging Into Madonna's Limelight|date=October 20, 1992|accessdate=December 13, 2012|first=Shapiro|last=Eben|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=1|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524101611/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/19/business/the-media-business-edging-into-madonna-s-limelight.html?scp=3&amp;sq=madonna%20sex&amp;st=cse|archivedate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the book managed to break records regarding the number of copies pre-ordered before the release. Nicholas Callaway pointed out that the book was an unprecedented hit, because the print run of an average art book ranges between 5 and 10,000&amp;nbsp;units.&lt;ref name="The Girl EW" /&gt; He described it as "the largest initial release of any illustrated book in publishing history".&lt;ref name="DigitalSpy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Girl EW"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312251,00.html|title=The Girl Can't Help It|date=September 25, 1992|accessdate=December 14, 2012|first=Sharon|last=Isaak|first2=Tina|last2=Jordan|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HIKwbPLs?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312251,00.html|archivedate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the high scandal and controversy surrounding the book, there was not really any need for Madonna to promote it;&lt;ref name="Leo"&gt;{{harvnb|Tassoni|1993|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, one of the few promotions for the book Madonna did, was appearing on the cover of the October edition of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', where she appeared dressed in "Hippie trip" fashion.

MTV also interviewed many people who had viewed the book on the day of its release at the HMV music store in New York City. In celebration of the release of the book, the store held a Madonna look-alike contest and set up a booth where people could view the book for one dollar a minute, with all of the proceeds going to Lifebeat, the music industry organization founded to help fund AIDS research.&lt;ref name="tres"&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|Reckhenrich|Kupp|2011|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Catlin from the ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' said that the passages from the book were "too dirty to quote here, even the funny ones".&lt;ref name="Courant" /&gt; ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' said that "the book is neither groundbreaking (save that it features a major star) nor particularly sexy [...] ''Sex'' is convincing only when it's playful, as when she appears nude in a Miami pizzeria, chewing a slice while a baffled customer looks on. Elsewhere, she's simply undressed with no place to go".&lt;ref name="The Daily Beast" /&gt; Richard Harrington from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave the book a mixed review by saying: "Is ''Sex'' shocking? not really.

Later reviews towards ''Sex'' have become more positive. The authors of ''The Porning of America: The Rise of Porn Culture, What It Means, and Where We Go from Here'' (2008) have commented that "the book is particularly interesting in the way that, like many of Madonna's works, it portrays sex in terms of domination and power",&lt;ref name="Scott 96" /&gt; whereas Jane Raphaely, editor-in-chief of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' praised Madonna's "liberated behavior on ''Sex'' [...] the fact that she takes all forms of pornography and systematically demystifies it by putting it under her control", in an article in 1996.&lt;ref name="Bell Klein"&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|Klein|1996|pp=431–432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian McNair, author of ''Striptease Culture: Sex, Media and the Democratisation of Desire'' (2002) praised this period of Madonna's career, saying that she had "porno elegance" and that "''Sex'' is a cultural phenomenon of global proportions and thanks to this Madonna established her iconic status and cultural influence".&lt;ref name="McNair"&gt;{{harvnb|McNair|2002|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priya Elan from ''[[The Guardian]]'', wrote: "That the ''Sex'' book came after a record-breaking album and [[Blond Ambition World Tour|tour]] felt like a shrinkwrapped curve ball. But Madge was expressing something unique". Elan felt that the book was part of a "slower reveal that began with confessional tracks such as '[[Oh Father]]' (from 1989's ''Like a Prayer'') and continued with the many scenes of narcissism captured in [the documentary] ''[[In Bed With Madonna]]''".&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

{{quote|Madonna's motive for baring her breasts to the public feels more like personal gratification, less like commitment to a cause. She's not out to change the world. Let's face it: Few people get erotic in front of millions of viewers for purely selfless political reasons. It's hard to escape the view of Madonna as a difficult Catholic adolescent aiming the finger at everything repressive. And many of her songs are addressed to an authority figure of her youth – from God and Jesus Christ to her own father. The heart of Madonna's outrageousness seems to lie beneath her liberal rationales, as if she's acting out something private and the world is her couch, not to mention her bank.

According to some writers, ''Sex'' also helped Madonna make a name in the [[porn industry]],&lt;ref name="Kirk Davidson" /&gt; and earned her the title of [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]]'s first [[cultural ambassador]]&lt;ref name="Nyissue SM"&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 18, 1994|title=S&amp;M offers a safe haven for ex "classy" topless bars|journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|page=40|volume=27|issue=47|issn=0028-7369|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XeMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was praised for recreating "porn-chic".&lt;ref name="Sex and Society"&gt;{{harvnb|Cavendish|2009|p=524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humberto Quiroga Lavié pointed out that it was the fact that ''Sex'' was considered pornographic that helped it become a [[bestseller]].&lt;ref name="Ensayo Judicial"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q0jh_O-065AC&amp;pg=PT1443&amp;dq=Madonna+y+su+libro+Sex&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3-rHULHlNomj2QW4ooGoDQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw|title=Secretos y Misterios de Hombres y Mujeres |last=Quiroga Lavié |first=Humberto |date=|accessdate=December 11, 2012|format=essay |language=Spanish |trans-title=Secrets and Mysteries of men and women }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Bachmann, on his book ''Simulating Sex: Aesthetic Representations of Erotic Activity'' pointed out that "perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Madonna's sexual phenomenon is the extent to which her book marked a new threshold in the pornographic franchise".&lt;ref name="Bachman 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Bachmann|2002|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; McNair wrote in his book that "''Sex'' brought out the personal underground to the surface of pop culture".&lt;ref name="McNair" /&gt; London art critic [[Sarah Kent]] wrote in ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine that the timing of ''Sex'' was "impeccable.&lt;ref name="brien238" /&gt; Obsessions about the human body was in vogue, with Madonna's book as well as artist [[Andres Serrano]]'s "[[Ejaculation|cumming shots]]" and [[Jeff Koons]]' ''The Jeff Koons Handbook'', the latter portrayed fairytale pictures of the artist having sex with his pornographic actor wife, [[Ilona Staller|Cicciolina]].&lt;ref name="brien238" /&gt;

''Sex'' has also become an important book in the [[LGBT]] community. [[Ben Shapiro]], author of ''Porn Generation: How Social Liberalism Is Corrupting Our Future'', wrote that due to its iconic status "''Sex'' adorns the coffee tables of hundreds of gay men and [[sperm bank]]s".&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2005|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Blankenship]], from the LGBT-oriented website New Now Next stated that "literature changed forever" with the publishing of ''Sex''.&lt;ref name="NewNowNext"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newnownext.com/madonna-sex-boo/10/2012/|title=My Weird Journey With Madonna's 'Sex' Book|date=October 22, 2012|accessdate=December 7, 2012|last=Blankenship|first=Mark|publisher=Newnownext.com.

The LGBT community felt it was an important portrayal for them. They debated whether Madonna was "ripping" them off for publicity. As Carolin Grace from ''[[Diva (magazine)|Diva]]'' magazine noted: "Madonna became meaningful in early nineties, when ''Sex'' came out, and at that point lesbian culture was really changing."&lt;ref name=obrien243 /&gt; She noted how women were coming out about their sexuality and the book's handling of the taboo issue were "a legacy, our contribution to the show. The lesbian sub-cultural references borrowed by Madonna aren't our only possessions."&lt;ref name=obrien243 /&gt; O'Brien argues in her book ''[[Madonna: Like an Icon]]'', that the book had a confusing philosophy. According to the female critics, who pointed out the vacuousness of Madonna's remarks about porn and abuse, the singer did not have a correct idea that behind these fantasies the "reality is too hard for her to endure", referring to the daily hustles that women have to face at red light districts and brothels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Brien|2008|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author felt that despite the courageous premise of genuine exploration of queer sex, the book crossed over into pornography and a wrong portrayal for the community, while being flippant and commercial.&lt;ref name="obr252" /&gt; She drew an example of the death of pornographic actor Joey Stefano, one of the models of the book, from drug overdose. Stefano had been thrilled to be a part of the book, but was underpaid. Once Madonna and her team were done with the shoot, "they packed up and left the [[Gaiety Theatre, New York (male burlesque)|Gaiety]]... They left behind the mundane reality and the boys who have to deal with it seven days a week."&lt;ref name="obr252"&gt;{{harvnb|O'Brien|2008|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==

''Sex'' has also become an object of modern culture references. American [[performance artist]] [[Ann Magnuson]], who had worked with Madonna on the 1985 film ''[[Desperately Seeking Susan]]'', released a [[parody]] of the book's photo sessions, where she simulated sex with a giant [[stuffed toy|stuffed bear]].&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{harvnb|Schneider|1997|pp=108–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, writer-performer [[Greg Scarnici]] released a book parody of ''Sex'', titled ''Sex in Drag'', which featured over 70&amp;nbsp;parodied images from the book.&lt;ref name="Greg Scarnici Sex in Drag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexindrag.com/PEEP.html|title=Sex in Drag|accessdate=December 14, 2012|first=Scarnici|last=Greg|authorlink=Greg Scarnici|publisher=SexinDrag.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231124738/http://www.sexindrag.com/PEEP.html|archivedate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a deleted scene from a 1993&amp;nbsp;episode (''[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]'') of the animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]'', aired as part of ''[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]'', [[Krusty the Clown]] attempts to market a book extremely similar to ''Sex'' as a means of resolving his financial woes. Krusty is seen in a suggestive pose on the front cover. Unlike Madonna, however, Krusty apparently never appeared fully nude, as he quickly claimed that he used a [[body double]].&lt;ref name="Krusty"&gt;{{harvnb|Ott|2008|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Madonna's look and attire she wore to the ''Sex'' pre-release party was ranked by ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine as one of her "50 Looks We Can't Forget".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.peoplestylewatch.com/people/stylewatch/gallery/0,,20218271_20490333,00.html#20489205|title = Madonna: 50 Looks We Can't Forget |work= [[People (magazine)|People]]|last1 = Parsley |first1 = Aaron |last2=Shultz |first2=Cara Lynn |date = August 14, 2008 |accessdate= March 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, a nude picture of Madonna taken by Meisel was put up for sale.

'''Sindhu Darshan Festival''' is a festival of [[India]] held every year on full moon day (on [[Guru Purnima]]) in June. It is held at [[Leh]], in [[Ladakh]] District of [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir]]. It stretches for three days. It was first started in the October, 1997 and continues to be held every year since then, attracting large number of foreign and domestic tourists.

The Sindhu Darshan Festival is a celebration of River Sindhu, also known as the Indus Valley Civilisation. The main reason behind the celebration of Sindhu Darshan Festival is to endorse the [[Indus]] River (Sindhu River) as an icon of the communal harmony and unity of India. The Bollywood film Dil Se was shot during the first Sindhi Darshan Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ladakhs.com/ladakh-festival.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The beginnings==
Lal Krishna Advani and Tarun Vijay a veteran journalist re-discovered the [[Sindhu]] river flowing through Ladakh, when they visited Leh in January 1996. Vijay conceived the idea of a festival on its banks as it has given the identity to India as the names India, Indian, Hindu and Hindustan are derived from indus and Sindhu. Since then it has been attracting people from all walks of life, castes, reliogions and places specially becoming a pilgrimage for Hindu Sindhis, who in pre-partition days, used to worship her ( in [[Sindh]] ), now in [[Pakistan]]. For, the purpose that, people of India, know the importance of Sindhu River, [[Lal Krishna Advani]], in 1996, himself a Sindhi, visited Choglamsar ( 8&amp;nbsp;km from Leh ) and started Sindhu Darshan Abhiyan, with handful of [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]]s.&lt;ref name=A&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gl1bi9duptQC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=sindhu+darshan+festival+Atal+Bihari+Vajpayee&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BUwEv9zhuM&amp;sig=kOE4nvgaQAEPRARzGaZUA-f6AdE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oDc5TceDC4LTrQfPl6TlCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=sindhu%20darshan&amp;f=false] Development of Ladakh Himalaya: recent researches By Prem Singh Jina. Pages : 129 to 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first time this event was held in form of ''Sindhu Darshan Festival'' was in October, 1997.

==Year 2000 Sindhu Darshan Festival==
Later on in year 2000, on 7 June, Sindhu Darshan Festival was held with much pomp and show and was inaugurated by [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], then the Prime Minister of India at [[Shey]] (15&amp;nbsp;km away from [[Leh]]).The Prime Minister laid the foundation stone of the Sindhu Cultural Center and also inaugurated the new office complex of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council.&lt;ref name=A/&gt;

The Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said ''"Some people queried about existence of Sindhu in India as described in our [[Indian National Anthem|national anthem]] but little did they know that it flows from our soil in Ladakh."'' He further added : ''"Sindhu symbolised 5,000 years ethos of Indian civilization and its re-discovery will strengthen emotional integration of country."'' and quoted hymn from [[Rig Veda]]: "Sindhu it might surpasses all the streams that flow - His roar is lifted up to heaven above the earth, he puts forth endless vigour with a flash of light, even as cow with milk rush to their calves, so other rivers roar in to Sindhu. As warrior king leads other warriors, so does Sindhu lead other rivers. Rich in good steed is Sindhu, rich in gold, nobly fashioned rich in ample wealth."&lt;ref name=A/&gt;

The occasion, was also marked by immersion of waters from [[Brahmaputra]] brought by [[Arunachal Pradesh]] Chief Minister, Mukut Mithi. Brahmputra &amp; Sindhu, both rivers rise from same source in [[Mansarovar]].&lt;ref name=A/&gt;

==Festivities==

Every year, a large number of participants from different parts of the country participate in Sindhu Darshan Festival. They bring water from the river of their own state in earthenware pots and immerse these pots in the Sindhu River.

The first day of the Sindhu Darshan Festival witnesses a reception ceremony for the participants, organized on the banks of Sindhu at [[Shey]]. This reception ceremony is conducted by a joint association of committees of various religious groups ( [[Buddhist]], [[Shia]], [[Sunni]], [[Christian]], [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] ) namely, Ladakh Buddhist Association, Shia Majlis, Sunni Anjuman, Christian Moravian Church, Hindu Trust and Sikh Gurudwara Prabhandak Committee, to promote national integrity. As a part of the ritual, fifty senior [[Lama]]s conduct a prayer on the banks of the river. A series of cultural programs is also presented by the artists from various states of the country. A sightseeing tour is organised for the participants and the day comes to an end with a bonfire at night. After the cultural programmes and sightseeing trip, a [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] is organized on the second day of the Sindhu Darshan Festival. On the third day, the participants get ready for the departure. [[Leh]] is popular with tourists, who visit the hill town to be a part of this grand celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indobase.com/events/details/sindhu-darshan-festival.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211160339/http://www.indobase.com/events/details/sindhu-darshan-festival.php |archivedate=11 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festivalsofindia.in/sindhu/index.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fountainheadindia.com/festivals_details.php]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/articles/sindhu-darshan-festival-in-ladakh.html]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postage stamp==
The Postal Department of Government of India issued a postage stamp depicting Sindhu Darshan Festival on 28 July 1999. The project 'Sindhu Darshan', was started to focus attention on the heritage of the ancient Indian Civilization and Culture that 'Sindhu' symbolizes. It aims to celebrate the Sindhu as a symbol of this country's ethnic diversity and to promote communal harmony. Further, attention is sought to be focused on cultural and topographical beauty of the landscape of Ladakh. These aspects are sought to be blended in the design of the [[First day cover|First Day Cover]] which also carries inscription of the hymn '[[mantra]]', chanted by Buddhists in the area, a prayer in praise of God. The stamp depicts a landscape in the upper reaches of the Sindhu with an inset of the 'Vrishabha' (bull) [[Indus valley seals and scripts|seal of the Indus Valley Civilization]] and a line, from the '[[Rig Veda]]', describing the Sindhu.

'''Temple Bar TradFest''' is an annual music and culture festival that takes place in late January in Dublin, Ireland. It is organised by the Temple Bar Company, a not-for-profit organisation who work on behalf of businesses in the cultural quarter of [[Temple Bar, Dublin]], Ireland.
The festival celebrates traditional Irish and folk music and cultural offerings.
The five-day festival attracted almost 25,000 visitors in 2017 and has become a draw for international audiences travelling from the US, UK and Europe. 
It is one of Ireland’s few independent and not-for-profit festivals, with ticket sales kept to a minimum price to ensure value for money for those attending. 
The festival has carved out a niche in attracting some of the biggest names internationally in folk and traditional Irish music. Billy Bragg, Donovan, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Maria McKee, Eddie Reader, Sarah Jarosz, Ralph McTell, Gilbert O’Sullivan and The Levellers have headlined at the festival.
Ireland’s best known troubadours and balladeers have graced the festival line up including: Glen Hansard; Aoife O’Donovan; Damien Dempsey; Declan O’Rourke; Paul Brady; Mundy; Mick Flannery; Maura O’Connell; and Finbar Furey.
Ireland’s top traditional Irish music groups and artists have performed at TradFest including: The Fureys; The Dublin Legends; Clannad; Altan; Beoga, who feature on Ed Sheeran’s Galway Girl; Martin Hayes; Kila; and Stockton’s Wing.
The thirteenth edition of the festival will take place on the 24th until the 28th of January 2018. More information on Temple Bar TradFest can be found on the official website, Temple Bar Trad [http://tradfest.ie/].

==History==
Since its inception in 2005 by the Temple Bar Company, TradFest has expanded its offering to reflect the festival’s ethos of ‘Trad without Frontiers’. This allows for an elaborate and varied line-up at each festival that incorporates myriad musical forms including: Celtic; folk; folk rock; nu folk; world music; and traditional Irish music.
The festival’s initial incentive was to provide a musical interlude for Irish and international visitors in January, a month void of any festival events until the formation of TradFest. [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] is a small area in Dublin’s City Centre and is known as the capital’s Cultural Quarter because of its abundance of public houses, street entertainment, art galleries and photography gallery.

Former Minister for Environment, [[Noel Dempsey]] , is Chairman of the Temple Bar Company. Martin Harte [http://visittemplebar.com/] is the company’s CEO and oversees the organization of TradFest annually. [[Stephen Rea]], the Irish actor, is a patron of the festival. [[Stephen Rea|Rea]] was nominated an Academy Award for his role in the Neil Jordan directed 1992 box office hit, [[The Crying Game]]. [[Kieran Hanrahan]] is the festival’s programme director . The Irish radio host and musician presents Ceílí House, a weekly show on [[RTÉ Radio 1]].

Since it formed TradFest uses some of Dublin’s landmark buildings to host its concerts. This allows the event to maintain an independence in the way it is organised and the low price of tickets sales. Venues include: [[City Hall, Dublin|City Hall]]; [[Irish House of Lords|The House of Lords]] ; [[St. Michan's Church, Dublin|St Michan’s]]  ; [[St. Werburgh's Church, Dublin|St Werburgh’s]] ; [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick’s Cathedral]]; and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christchurch]] .

===Festival Highlights===
The festival prides itself on the promotion and support of new and up-and-coming acts as well as established names in the world of folk and traditional [[Music of Ireland|Irish music]].
Several promotional events have played a part in TradFest reaching an international audience. [[The Kilfenora Céilí]] Band performed a free concert on top of the hotel belonging to [[U2]], [[Clarence Hotel|The Clarence Hotel]]. It was the same venue where [[U2]] performed to promote their song, [[Beautiful Day]]. [[Beoga]] also did a naked photo shoot for TradFest. The group have gone on to fame for their part in [[Ed Sheeran|Ed Sheeran’s]] [[Galway Girl (Ed Sheeran song)|Galway Girl]] and performed on the Pyramid Stage at [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] in 2017.
Some of the most notable concerts at TradFest include a [[Clannad]] reunion at Christchurch cathedral (27th, 28th and 29 January 2011). [[The Dubliners]] celebrated their 50th anniversary at [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christchurch Cathedral]] in 2012, just three months before [[Barney McKenna]] passed away. 
The festival has always supported contemporary commissions including two by renowned composer Lorcan McMathuna which celebrate the Battle of Clontarf and the 1916 Rising. New works by singer songwriter Declan O’Rourke have been showcased at TradFest (2014).
