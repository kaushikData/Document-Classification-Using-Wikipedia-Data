'''80,000 Hours''' is a San Francisco-based organisation that conducts research on the careers with positive social impact and provides career advice. It provides this advice online, through one-on-one advice sessions and through a community of like-minded individuals. The organisation is part of the '''Centre for Effective Altruism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, affiliated with the [[University of Oxford]] Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics.&lt;ref name="80k-history" /&gt; The organisation's name refers to the typical amount of time someone spends working over a lifetime.&lt;ref name="80k-faq"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://80000hours.org/faq | title = FAQ | accessdate = 29 October 2012 | publisher = 80,000 Hours | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121101064337/http://80000hours.org/faq | archivedate = 1 November 2012 | df = dmy-all }}; {{cite web | url = http://www.euromoney.com/Article/3044777/Impact-investing-the-big-business-of-small-donors.html | title = Impact investing: the big business of small donors | accessdate = 31 October 2012 | publisher = Euromoney }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the nonprofits funded by startup accelerator [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=yc-techcrunch&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/04/80000-hours/|title = Want To Make An Impact With Your Work?

== Principles ==
According to 80,000 Hours, some careers aimed at doing good are far more effective than others. On their framework for assessing different career options, the value of a career is regarded as depending on both its potential for impact and on the degree to which it gives the individual better opportunities to have an impact in the future.&lt;ref name="80k-about"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://80000hours.org/research | title = Research | accessdate = 17 January 2014 | publisher = 80,000 Hours}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group emphasises that the positive impact of choosing a certain occupation should be measured by the amount of additional good that is done as a result of this choice, not by the amount of good directly done.&lt;ref name="80k-counterfactuals"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://80000hours.org/blog/35-the-replaceability-effect-working-in-unethical-industries-part-1 | title = The replaceability effect: working in unethical industries part 1 | author = Sebastian Farquhar | accessdate = 31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers indirect ways of making a difference, such as [[Earning to give|earning a high salary in a conventional career and donating]] a portion of it, as well as direct ways, such as scientific research. The moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]] mentions the example of banking and finance as a potentially high impact career through such donations in his TED Talk, "The why and how of effective altruism," where he discusses the work of 80,000 Hours.&lt;ref name="peter-singer-TED-talk"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism.html | title = The why and how of effective altruism | author = Peter Singer | accessdate = 27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[William MacAskill]] is the Founder and President of 80,000 Hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/about/meet-the-team/|title=Meet the team|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=4 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Co-founder and Vice-President of [[Giving What We Can]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/the-team|title=The Team|accessdate=16 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021170844/http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/the-team|archivedate=21 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Research Associate at the Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/staff/staff/research_associates/will_macaskill|title=William MacAskill, Research Associate|accessdate=16 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023051515/http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/staff/staff/research_associates/will_macaskill|archivedate=23 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
80,000 Hours has promoted the idea that pursuing a high-earning career and donating a significant portion of the income to cost-effective charities can be an effective philanthropic strategy for some people. [[John Humphrys]] criticised this idea on the [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|BBC Today programme]], saying that people interested in becoming wealthy tend to be selfish and that idealistic young people will become cynical as they age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview | last = Crouch | first = William | last2 = Hislop | first2 = Ian | title= BBC News - Today - Do bankers make the world better? | subjectlink2 = Ian Hislop | others = [[John Humphrys]] |work=Today | date = 22 November 2011  | access-date = 29 October 2012 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9645000/9645137.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea was also criticised in the ''Oxford Left Review'', where Pete Mills wrote that lucrative careers perpetuate an unjust system.&lt;ref name="oxford-left"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mills | first = Pete | title = The Ethical Careers Debate | journal = The Oxford Left Review | issue = 7 | pages = 4–9 | date = May 2012 | url=http://oxfordleftreview.com/2012/07/17/olr-issue/ | access-date = 6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he argues that because the likelihood of bringing about social change is difficult to quantify, 80,000 Hours is biased toward quantifiable methods of doing good.

Over time 80,000 Hours has deemphasised 'earning to give', in favour of alternative paths like research, advocacy or policy reform, and begun recommending work on problems that are less easily quantified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/2015/07/80000-hours-thinks-that-only-a-small-proportion-of-people-should-earn-to-give-long-term/|title=80,000 Hours thinks that only a small proportion of people should earn to give long term - 80,000 Hours|date=2015-07-06|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/|title=A list of the most urgent global issues|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' has criticised the organisation for its [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] approach to altruism and has argued that cultivating altruism is not purely a matter of maximising one's positive social impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper | last = Brooks | first = David | title = How to Produce a Person | newspaper = The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html |date=4 June 2013 |page=A25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[effective altruism]] movement, of which 80,000 Hours is a part, has been criticised by Ken Berger, the founder of [[Charity Navigator]] for its efforts to objectively compare and prioritise charitable causes, which he believes to be a subjective process that is the responsibility of individual donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Elitist Philanthropy of So-Called Effective Altruism | journal = Stanford Social Innovation Review | url = http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/the_elitist_philanthropy_of_so_called_effective_altruism}}&lt;/ref&gt; William MacAskill responded to this article justifying the need to figure out which charities do the most good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/what_charity_navigator_gets_wrong_about_effective_altruism|title=What Charity Navigator Gets Wrong About Effective Altruism (SSIR)|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ālambana''' ([[Sanskrit]]:आलम्बन), is a Sanskrit noun which variously means – support, foundation, supporting, base, sustaining, cause, reason, basis, or the five attributes of things, or the silent repetition of a prayer, or the natural and necessary connection of a sensation with the cause which excites it, or the mental exercise practiced by the yogis in endeavouring to realize the gross form of the Eternal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit. de|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=alambana&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedic implication==

In [[Indian philosophy]] the word, ''ālambana'', refers to the objective basis of a perception or sensation; according to which philosophy ''Kārana'' (cause) and all attendant emotional conditions are known as ''Vibhavas'' which are of two kinds – a) ''Ālambana'', the personal and human object and substratum, and b) ''Uddipana'', the excitant. ''Ālambana'' may further be divided into ''asraya'' and ''visaya'', [[Radha]] is ''asraya'' and [[Krishna]] is ''visaya''; Radha, as the devotee, experienced greater pleasure than Krishna who remained the object of her veneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vaniquotes|url= http://vaniquotes.org/wiki/Vibhava_is_divided_into_the_two_categories_alambana_and_uddipana._Alambana_may_be_further_divided_into_asraya_and_visaya }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Visaya'' is the potential object of a perceptual consciousness, ''ālambana'' is the objective basis which can even be the cause of perceptual or cognition support for a perceptual error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Logic, Language and Reality:Indian Philosophy and Contemporary Issues|author=Bimal Kroshna Matilal|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V8SLH7ogB9oC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=alambana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ItvAU9PuDdeQuASzuIHYAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nyaya]] school does not consider the object in front to be the ''ālambana'' of the illusory cognition but rather the interfering external element with its own characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhamati and Vivarna Schools of Advaita: A Critical Approach|author=Poolasth Soobah Roodurmum|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=54|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2pU2ZQB2wUYC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=alambana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ItvAU9PuDdeQuASzuIHYAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best ''ālambana'' for the ''[[upasana]]'' of [[Brahman]] is [[Om]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gaudapadakarika|author=Gaudapada|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lz08gSuuLQkC&amp;pg=PA296&amp;dq=alambana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8-HAU8fNNs-l8AWL6IK4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Vedic]] parlance, ''ālambana'' is also known as ''skambha'' i.e. the pillar of strength; God is the pillar of strength;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Philosophy for Himalayan Eco-System Development|author=M.L.Dewan|publisher=Concept Publishing Co.|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hebaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=alambana+vedic&amp;dq=alambana+vedic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zOvBU8nQEI63uAS5p4HABg&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the objective contemplation which lends support to the mind in its travel Godwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wisdom of the Hindus|author=Brian Brown|publisher=Brentanos|page=278|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLwlAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=alambana+upanishads&amp;dq=alambana+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_fjBU7GrJM28uASmtIHAAg&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rasa implication==

In the Indian theory of [[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]], ''Uddipana'' is the excitant or determinant which inflames sentiments or emotions, and ''ālambana'' is that on which the sentiment hangs i.e. ''ālambana'' is with reference to the sentiment which arises as the link between a sentiment and the cause which excites it. In ''Rasa'' process, the nature or object is said to be visibly present before the ''asraya'' as an excitant but the object that arouses emotions is usually imagined by the poet or dramatist; the mere presence of ''vibhava'' impels the configuration of ''Pratibha'' (the intuitive outcome of wisdom or knowledge) to change it in no time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=I.A.Richards and Indian Theory of Rasa|author=Gupteshwar Prasad|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons |pages=92,230|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hmy5cnSbsWYC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=alambana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uODAU_2XH8Xs8AWJiIGwBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per the Rasa of Heroic devotion in compassion the enhancing excitants include transitory emotions such as impatience, understanding and happiness, and Krishna in some disguised form is offered by the hero, motivated by kindness, his own body. [[Yuddhisthira]] had made sacrificial offerings to Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhaktirasamrtasindhu of Rupa Gosvamin|author=Rupa Gosvami|publisher=Motolal Banarsidass|pages=579–581|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DsRb6gjUa1oC&amp;pg=PA581&amp;dq=alambana+vedic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ru3BU63-K82XuATh84GoBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana%20vedic&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yogic implication==

With the aid of self-supported yoga or ātmālmbana yoga, [[Ishvara]] can be seen in two ways i.e. dual and non-dual, or can be seen as fourfolded. ''Ālambana'' refers to inner support and [[yoga]] refers to self-discipline; ''ātmālambana yoga'' is the discipline of objectifying the non-self with the aid of the self when the negated-self becomes the object of the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Paratattvagaonitadarsanam|author=G.S.Murty|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |pages=174,175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ig1-enQgyE8C&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=alambana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uODAU_2XH8Xs8AWJiIGwBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patanjali]] while defining Sleep which is a [[vritti]] of [[Buddhi]], just as the waking state and the dream states are, tells us:

:अभावप्रत्ययालम्बना तमोवर्त्तिर्निद्रा (Yoga Sutra Samādhipada 10)

:"Deep sleep is the absence of all impressions resulting from opacity in that which is mutable in human-beings (citta)."

Here, he has used the word, ''ālambana'', to mean support or based on i.e. absence of impressions is supported / based on inertia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Samadhi pada 10 |publisher=Ashtangayoga.info |url=http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-1/item/abhava-pratyaya-alambana-tamo-vrittir-nidra/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827022537/http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-1/item/abhava-pratyaya-alambana-tamo-vrittir-nidra/ |archivedate=2014-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist implication==

According to the [[Yogacara]] phenomenology the ''ālambana'' condition, whether immediate direct or remote, means if there exists a dharma it will have a distinct appearance, the mind will sometimes correspond with it (''[[lakshana]]'') for that ''[[dharma]]'' to be cognized and perceptually grasped. This condition leads to the awakening which results in the ending of the eight consciousnesses and replacing them with four enlightened cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Phenomenology|author=Dan Lusthaus|publisher=Routledge|pages=500–503|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j0TKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA500&amp;lpg=PA500&amp;dq=alambana&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KV4dFfAzsT&amp;sig=GRwQCtuiXAQdCTfXc6lYHCm5164&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4NbAU9rpA4b88QWZsIKgCg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist consider ''ālambana'' as a cause same as ''hetu'', ''samanantara'' and ''adhipati'', they consider it to be the object-condition which is taken as the cause in the production of knowledge and mentals, such as ''citta'' and ''caitta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Central Philosophy of Buddhism|author=T.R.V.Murti|publisher=Routledge|page=170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mmvzSw2igPUC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=alambana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ItvAU9PuDdeQuASzuIHYAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Nagarjuna]] there are three motivational contexts of love and compassion viz, ''sattva-ālambana'', motivated by the similarity of one’s self with other selves, ''dharma-ālambana'', motivated by the sameness of psycho-physical elements, and ''ānalambana'' which is not motivated by these two i.e. which is independent of motivational context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Critical Superiority|author=Shohei Ichimura|page=81|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xTW6XNxOxbkC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=alambana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ItvAU9PuDdeQuASzuIHYAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xuanzang]] in the context of [[Dignāga]]’s statement with reference to the eighth consciousness explains that the seeds or virtualities of the eighth consciousness produce the actual consciousness and also the objective base (ālambana) of actual consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Phenomenology and Indian Philosophy|publisher=SUNY PRESS|page=265|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hCfipfaNM44C&amp;pg=PA265&amp;dq=alambana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8-HAU8fNNs-l8AWL6IK4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the [[Unicode block|block]] of characters encoded in Unicode|Alchemical Symbols (Unicode block)}}

'''Alchemical symbols''', originally devised as part of [[alchemy]], were used to denote some elements and some compounds until the 18th century. Although notation like this was mostly standardized, style and symbol varied between alchemists, so this page lists the most common.

==Three primes==
According to [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541), the three primes or ''tria prima'' – of which material substances are immediately composed – are:&lt;ref name="Eric John Holmyard 1990. p.153"&gt;Eric John Holmyard. ''Alchemy.'' 1995. p.153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Friedlander. ''The golden wand of medicine: a history of the caduceus symbol in medicine.'' 1992. p.76-77&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] (Mind) &lt;big&gt;☿&lt;/big&gt; [[Image:Mercury symbol.svg|28px]]
* [[Salt (chemistry)|Salt]] (base matter or body) &lt;big&gt;🜔&lt;/big&gt; [[File:Line within circle.svg|25px]]
* [[Sulfur]] (Spirit) &lt;big&gt;🜍&lt;/big&gt; [[Image:Sulphur.svg|20px]]

==Four basic elements==
{{main|Classical elements}}
Western alchemy makes use of the Hermetic elements.  The symbols used for these are:&lt;ref name="Eric John Holmyard 1990. p.153"/&gt;
*[[Air (classical element)|Air]] &lt;big&gt;🜁&lt;/big&gt; [[Image:Alchemy air symbol.svg|20px]]
*[[Earth (classical element)|Earth]] &lt;big&gt;🜃&lt;/big&gt; [[Image:Alchemy earth symbol.svg|20px]] 
*[[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] &lt;big&gt;🜂&lt;/big&gt; [[Image:Alchemy fire symbol.svg|20px]]
*[[Water (classical element)|Water]] &lt;big&gt;🜄&lt;/big&gt; [[Image:Alchemy water symbol.svg|20px]]

==Seven planetary metals==
{{main|Classical planets in Western alchemy|Planets in astrology|Metals of antiquity}}

Seven metals are associated with the seven classical planets, and seven deities, all figuring heavily in alchemical symbolism. Although the metals occasionally have a glyph of their own, the planet's symbol is used most often, and the symbolic and mythological septenary is consistent with Western astrology. The planetary symbolism is limited to the seven [[wandering stars]] visible to the naked eye, and the extra-Saturnian planets [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] are not used.

*[[Lead]] dominated by [[Saturn (astrology)|Saturn]] &lt;big&gt;♄&lt;/big&gt; (&amp;nbsp;[[Image:Saturn symbol.svg|20px]]&amp;nbsp;)&lt;ref name="Eric John Holmyard 1990. p.153"/&gt;
*[[Tin]] dominated by [[Jupiter (astrology)|Jupiter]] &lt;big&gt;♃&lt;/big&gt; (&amp;nbsp;[[Image:Jupiter symbol.svg|20px]]&amp;nbsp;)
*[[Iron]] dominated by [[Mars (astrology)|Mars]] &lt;big&gt;♂&lt;/big&gt; (&amp;nbsp;[[Image:Mars symbol.svg|20px]]&amp;nbsp;)
*[[Gold]] dominated by [[Sun (astrology)|Sol]] &lt;big&gt;☉&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;☼&lt;/big&gt; (&amp;nbsp;[[Image:Sun symbol.svg|20px]]&amp;nbsp;)
*[[Copper]] dominated by [[Venus (astrology)|Venus]] &lt;big&gt;♀&lt;/big&gt; (also: [[Image:Copper symbol.svg|30px]]&amp;nbsp;)
*[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] (quicksilver) dominated by [[Mercury (astrology)|Mercury]] &lt;big&gt;☿&lt;/big&gt; (&amp;nbsp;[[Image:Mercury symbol.svg|20px]]&amp;nbsp;)
*[[Silver]] dominated by [[Moon (astrology)|Luna]] &lt;big&gt;☽&lt;/big&gt; (&amp;nbsp;[[Image:Crescent.svg|15px]]&amp;nbsp;)

==Mundane elements==

*[[Zinc]] [[File:Zinc-alchemy symbols.png|100px]]

==Alchemical compounds==

The alchemical [[magnum opus (alchemy)|magnum opus]] was sometimes expressed as a series of chemical operations. In cases where these numbered twelve, each could be assigned one of the [[Zodiac]] signs as a form of cryptography.  The following example can be found in [[Antoine-Joseph Pernety|Pernety's]] 1758 Mytho-Hermetic Dictionary:&lt;ref&gt;Antoine-Joseph Pernety. ''Dictionnaire mytho-hermétique, dans lequel on trouve les allégories fabuleuses des poètes, les métaphores, les énigmes et les termes barbares des philosophes hermétiques expliqués.'' 1758. p.99&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1887">{{Refimprove|date=February 2014}}'''Bandhu''' (1), [[Sanskrit]] for ''friend'' connected with ''bandhan'' or ''ties'' which are the connections that, according to the  [[Vedas]] link the outer and the inner worlds. [[Vedas|Vedic]] texts {{which|date=November 2011}} speak, for example, of the 360 bones of the fetus that fuse into the 206 bones of the adult (after the 360 days of the year). Recently, the word has been used in a Song of a Bollywood Feature Film " Cocktail ", Where a Man Calls a girl(Tum hi ho Bandhu)he likes and Rates her as an Angel from the outer world Connected to him. It is used commonly in ''Hindi'' in the sense of "brother".  Synonyms: "Hindi", it may mean ''bhai" as in "Twamecha Bandhu, sakha twameva", part of the Krishna stotra, where Lord Krishna is being referred to as "brother".  In ''Urdu'' it takes the meaning of ''bhai''.

[[Rajiv Malhotra]] in his book [[Being Different]] describes how 'Bandhuta/Bandhu' is an in-built feature of this universe. In the story&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-29/vintage-wisdom/30341831_1_devas-universe-vedas&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prajapati]] attempts to create the Universe keeping Order and Chaos in dynamic balance. His initial attempts fail because they're too 'Jami'/homogenous or too 'Prthak'/different. Finally he gets the combination just-right, by using the principle of 'Bandhuta'/'Bandhu' i.e. binding together dissimilar things by what is common across all things in the entire creation.

As per Dharma traditions 'Bandhuta' exists in all planes/fields connecting them together. Few noteworthy fields are 'Nrittya'/Dance, 'Sangeet'/Music, 'Jyotish'/Astrology, 'Vastu-Shastra', [[Yoga]], [[Ayurveda]]/Medicine.

'''Beet vascular necrosis''' and '''rot''' is a soft rot disease caused by the bacterium '''''Pectobacterium carotovorum'' subsp. ''betavasculorum''''', which has also been known as ''Pectobacterium betavasculorum'' and ''Erwinia carotovora'' subsp. ''betavasculorum''.&lt;ref name=Compendium2 /&gt; It was classified in the [[genus]] ''Erwinia'' until genetic evidence suggested that it belongs to its own group;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dye|first=DW|title=A taxonomic study of the genus Erwinia. II. The "carotovora" group|journal=New Zealand Journal of Science|year=1969|volume=12|pages=81–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the name Erwinia is still in use. As such, the disease is sometimes called Erwinia rot today. It is a very destructive disease that has been reported across the United States as well as in Egypt. Symptoms include [[wilting]] and black streaks on the leaves and [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]]. It is usually not fatal to the plant, but in severe cases the beets will become hollowed and unmarketable. The bacteria is a [[generalist species]] which rots beets and other plants by secreting digestive enzymes that break down the [[cell wall]] and [[parenchyma]] tissues.&lt;ref name=Ecology/&gt; The bacteria thrive in warm and wet conditions, but cannot survive long in fallow soil.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=DescriptionEtiology /&gt; However, it is able to persist for long periods of time in the [[rhizosphere]] of weeds and non-host crops.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt; While it is difficult to eradicate, there are cultural practices that can be used to control the spread of the disease, such as avoiding injury to the plants and reducing or eliminating application of nitrogen fertilizer.

== Hosts ==

Fodder beets, [[sugar beets]] and fodder-sugar crosses are all susceptible to infection by ''Pectobacterium carotovorum'' subsp. ''betavasculorum''.&lt;ref name=Compendium2&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=E.D |editor1-last=Whitney |title=Compendium of Beet Diseases and Insects |edition=2nd |year=1986 |publisher=American Phytopathological Society |location=St. Paul, MN }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today most beet [[cultivars]] are resistant to the pathogen, however, isolates vary geographically, and some cultivars of beets are only resistant to specific isolates of bacteria. For example, the cultivar USH11 demonstrates resistance to both Montana  and California isolates, whereas Beta 4430 is highly susceptible to the Montana isolates but resistant to the California isolate.&lt;ref name=Zidack&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zidack|first=Nina|author2=Barry Jacobsen|title=First Report and Virulence Evaluation of Erwinia caratovora subs. Betavasculorum on Sugarbeet in Montana|journal=Plant Health Progress|year=2001|url=http://www.plantmanagementnetwork.org/pub/php/research/sugarbeet/|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other cultivars resistant to California isolates of ''Pectobacterium caratovorum'' subsp. ''betavasculorum'' include Beta 4776R, Beta 4430R and Beta 4035R, but HH50 has been found to be susceptible.&lt;ref name=Zidack /&gt;

Breeding for resistance to other diseases such as [[beet yellows virus]] without also selecting for vascular necrosis resistance can leave cultivars susceptible to the pathogen. For example, the use of USH9A and H9B in California’s San Joaquin valley is thought to have led to an epiphytotic (severe) outbreak of disease in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=WhitneyLewellen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitney|first=E.D.|author2=R.T. Lewellen |title=Bacterial Vascular Necrosis and Rot of Sugar Beet: Effects on Cultivars and Quality|journal=Phytopathology |year=1977|volume=67|issue=10|pages=912–916|doi=10.1094/phyto-67-912}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was likely because of the limited gene pool used when selecting strongly for resistance to beet yellows virus. Further information on resistant cultivars can be found in the section [[#Management|Management]].

In addition to beets, ''Pectobacterium carotovara'' subsp. ''betavasculorum'' can also infect tomato, potato, carrots, sweet potato, radish, sunflower, artichokes, squash, cucumber and chrysanthemum.&lt;ref name=Compendium2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Egypt /&gt;  Other [[subspecies]] of ''Pectobacterium carotovora'' can also be [[pathogenic]] to beets. ''Erwinia carotovara'' subsp. ''atroseptica'' is a bacterial soft rot pathogen that is responsible for the disease Blackleg of Potato (''Solanum tuberosum''), and variants of this bacterium can cause root rot in sugarbeets,.&lt;ref name=DeBoer&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Boer|first=Solke H.|title=Blackleg of Potato|journal=The Plant Health Instructor|year=2004|url=http://www.plantmanagementnetwork.org/pub/php/research/sugarbeet/|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deMendonca&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Mendonca|first=Margarida|author2=M.E. Stanghellini |title=Endemic and Soilborne Nature of Erwinia Carotovora var. atroseptica, a pathogen of Mature Sugarbeets|journal=Ecology and Epidemiology |year=1979|volume=69|issue=10|pages=1093–1099|doi=10.1094/phyto-69-1096}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This subspecies also has a wide host-range. ''Erwinia carotovora'' var. ''atroseptica'' has been detected in the rhizosphere of native vegetation and on weed species such as ''Lupinus blumerii'' and ''Amaranthus palmeri'' (pigweed).&lt;ref name=deMendonca /&gt;  It is thought that the source of inoculums survives on these non-host plants in areas in which it is endemic as well as in the rhizosphere of other crops such as wheat and corn&lt;ref name=deMendonca /&gt;

== Symptoms ==

[[File:Pectobacterium Table Beet Stem.jpg|thumb|right|Table beet stem infected with ''Pectobacterium carotovorum'' subsp. ''betavasculorum''. Note entry through a wound.]]

Symptoms can be found on both beet roots and foliage, although foliar symptoms are not always present. If present, foliar symptoms include dark streaking along petioles and viscous froth deposits on the crown which are a by-product of bacterial metabolism.&lt;ref name=Strasbaugh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strausbaugh|first=Carl A.|author2=Anne M. Gillen|title=Bacterial and yeast associated with sugar beet root rot at harvest in the Intermountain West|journal=Plant Disease|year=2008|volume=92|issue=3|pages=357–363|doi=10.1094/pdis-92-3-0357}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Petioles can also become necrotic and demonstrate vascular necrosis. When roots become severely affected, wilting also occurs.&lt;ref name=Compendium2/&gt;  Below ground symptoms include both soft and dry root rot. Affected vascular bundles in roots become necrotic and brown, and tissue adjacent to necrosis becomes pink upon air contact.&lt;ref name=Compendium2/&gt;  The plants that do not die completely may have rotted-out, cavernous roots.

Various pathogens can cause root rot in beets; however the black streaking on petioles and necrotic vascular bundles in roots and adjacent pink tissue help to distinguish this disease from others such as Fusarium Yellows. Additionally, sampling from the rhizosphere of infected plants and serological tests can confirm the presence of ''Erwinia caratovora'' subs.&lt;ref name=deMendonca /&gt;

==Disease cycle==

''Pectobacterium carotovorum'' subsp. ''betavasculorum'' is a [[gram negative]], rod bacteria with peritichous [[flagella]].&lt;ref name=Compendium&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=R.M. |editor1-last=Haverson |title=Compendium of Beet Diseases and Pests |edition=2nd |year=2009 |publisher=American Phytopathological Society |location=St. Paul, MN |pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; For it to enter sugar beet, and thus cause infection, it is essential that there is an injury to the leaves, petioles or crown.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook&gt;{{cite web|title=Sugar Beet Production Guide, Chapter 11: Disease Management, pg 138-139|url=http://www.ianrpubs.unl.edu/epublic/live/ec156/build/ec156-11.pdf|publisher=University of Nebraska – Lincoln Extension, 2013|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infection will often start at the crown and then move down into the root, and can occur at any point in the growing season if environmental conditions are favorable.&lt;ref name=DescriptionEtiology&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=S.V.|title=Beet Vascular Necrosis and Rot of Sugarbeet: General Description and Etiology|journal=Phytopathology|year=1977|volume=67|issue=10|pages=1183–1189|url=http://www.apsnet.org/publications/phytopathology/backissues/Documents/1977Articles/Phyto67n10_1183.pdf|accessdate=17 October 2013|doi=10.1094/phyto-67-1183|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Once the bacteria enters the plant, it will invade the [[vascular tissue]] and cause symptoms by producing plant cell wall degrading enzymes, like pectinases, polygalactronases, and celluases.&lt;ref name=Molecular&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=H.-S.|title=Pectobacterium carotovorum Elicits Plant Cell Death with DspE/F but the P. carotovorum DspE Does Not Suppress Callose or Induce Expression of Plant Genes Early in Plant–Microbe Interactions|journal=Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions|year=2011|volume=24|issue=7|pages=773–786|doi=10.1094/mpmi-06-10-0143|pmid=21469936|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in discolored or necrotic vascular tissue in the root, and the tissue bordering the vascular bundles will turn reddish upon contact with air.&lt;ref name=DescriptionEtiology /&gt; Following the infection of the vascular tissue, the bacteria reproduce as long as food resources are available, and the root begins to rot.&lt;ref name=DescriptionEtiology /&gt; There is significant variability in the type of rot – it can range from a dry rot to soft and [[wet rot]] – because of the multitude of additional microorganisms that may colonize the damaged tissue&lt;ref name=DescriptionEtiology /&gt;

Huang|title=Bacterial Vascular Necrosis and Root Rot Disease of Sugar Beet in Egypt|journal=Journal of Phytopathology|year=1996|volume=144|issue=5|pages=225–230–1189|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0434.1996.tb01520.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, since those are often planted in the same season as sugar beets, they are not likely to be overwintering hosts.

== Environment ==

Injury to the leaves, petioles or crown is mandatory for the [[pathogen]] to gain entry to the host tissue.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt;  Accordingly, [[hail]] damage is correlated with a higher degree of disease outbreak.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt; Young plants (less than eight weeks old) are also considered to be more prone to infection&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt;

Temperature and availability of moisture are key factors in determining the rate of disease development. Warm temperatures, 25-30&amp;nbsp;°C, promote rapid disease development.,&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=PNDH /&gt; and can result in acute symptoms.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt; Symptoms are also reported to appear at temperatures as low as 18&amp;nbsp;°C, but disease development is slowed;&lt;ref name=DescriptionEtiology /&gt; below that temperature, infections do not develop.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt; Excessive water also promotes disease development by providing a more optimal environment for the pathogen,&lt;ref name=PNDH /&gt; and has been shown to be a key factor in augmenting disease outbreak in fields with sprinkler irrigation&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;

===Agricultural===

The degree of [[nitrogen fertilization]] is highly correlated to robust disease development: it has been shown that sugar beets supplied with excessive or adequate nitrogen are more diseased than sugarbeets with sub-optimal nitrogen levels.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=PNDH /&gt; This is a paradox for farmers because, while increased nitrogen fertilization does increase sugar yield in non-infected sugarbeets, it also increases the severity of the disease if infection takes place. Thus, depending on the severity of infection, yield may go down with increased fertilizer use.&lt;ref name=Spacing&amp;N /&gt;

The spacing between plants also impacts the degree of infection: greater in-row spacing results in more diseased roots.&lt;ref name=Spacing&amp;N /&gt; This may be due to the fact that greater spacing promotes faster growth, and hence greater probability of cracks in the crown,&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt; or because of the increased amount of nitrogen available per plant.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;

Since the pathogen has multiple hosts, it is important for farmers to be wary of other plants in the surrounding area. It is possible for the pathogen to survive in weedy hosts, and can infect injured carrots, potato, sweet potato, tomato, radish, squash, and cucumber.&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Egypt /&gt;&lt;ref name=PNDH /&gt; Hence, the presence of these plants may increase the supply of inoculum.

===Laboratory===

If the pathogen is cultured in a lab, it can grow on Miller and Schroth media, can use sucrose to make reducing sugars, and can use either lactose, methyl alpha-glucoside, inulin or raffinose to make acids.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt; It is also capable of surviving in culture medium sodium levels of up to 7–9%,&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt; and in temperatures  as high as 39&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=PotatovSB&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanghellini|first=M.E.|title=Serological and Physiological Differences of Erwinia carotovora between Potato and Sugar Beet|journal=Phytopathology|year=1977|volume=67|issue=10|pages=1178–1182|url=https://www.apsnet.org/publications/phytopathology/backissues/Documents/1977Articles/Phyto67n10_1178.PDFf|accessdate=17 October 2013|doi=10.1094/phyto-67-1178|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==

Since the bacteria cannot survive in seeds,&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt; the best way to prevent the disease is to ensure that [[vegetatively propagated]] plant material are clean of infection, such that the bacterium does not enter the soil. However, if the bacteria is already present, there are some methods that can be used to lessen the infection.

===Cultural practices===

Because the bacteria readily enter the plant through wounds, management practices that decrease injury to the plants are important to control the spread of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallian|first=John J.|title=Management of Sugarbeet Root Rots|url=http://www.cals.uidaho.edu/edcomm/pdf/PNW/PNW0538.pdf|publisher=Pacific Northwest Extension|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultivation is not recommended, as the machinery can become contaminated and physically spread the bacteria around the soil. Accidental leaf tearing or root scarring can also occur depending on the size of the crop, allowing the bacteria to enter more individual plants. If [[hilling]] the beets, great care must be taken to avoid getting soil into the crown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UC Pest Management Guidelines|url=http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/r735101111.html|publisher=University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the pathogen is soil-borne and this could expose the plant to more bacteria, thus increasing the risk of infection.

While most bacteria are motile and can swim, they cannot move very far due to their small size. However, they can be carried along by water, and a significant movement of ''Pectobacterium'' can be attributed to being carried downstream from irrigation and rainwater.&lt;ref name=Ecology&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perombelon|first=Michel CM|author2=Kelman, Arthur|title=Ecology of the soft rot erwinias|journal=Annual Review of Phytopathology|year=1980|volume=18|issue=1|pages=361–387|doi=10.1146/annurev.py.18.090180.002045}}&lt;/ref&gt; To control the spread of the disease, limiting irrigation is another strategy. The bacteria also flourishes in wet conditions, so limiting excess water can control both the spread and severity of the disease.

Increased in-row spacing also causes more severe disease. In an infected field, yield decreased linearly when spacing was greater than 15&amp;nbsp;cm (6&amp;nbsp;in),&lt;ref name=Spacing&amp;N&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=S V|author2=Hills, F. J.|author3=Whitney, E. D.|author4=Schroth, M. N.|title=Sugar and root yield of sugar beets as affected by bacterial vascular necrosis and rot, nitrogen fertilization, and plant spacing|journal=Phytopathology|year=1981|volume=71|issue=6|pages=605–608|url=http://www.apsnet.org/publications/phytopathology/backissues/Documents/1981Articles/Phyto71n06_605.pdf|accessdate=17 October 2013|doi=10.1094/phyto-71-605}}&lt;/ref&gt; so a spacing of 6 inches or less is recommended.

The bacteria can also utilize nitrogen fertilizer to accelerate their growth, thus limiting or eliminating the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied will lessen the disease severity.&lt;ref name=PNDH&gt;{{cite web|title=Sugar Beet (Beta vulgaris)-Bacterial Vascular Necrosis and Rot {Erwinia Root Rot}|url=http://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/sugar-beet-beta-vulgaris-bacterial-vascular-necrosis-and-rot-erwinia-root-rot|publisher=pacific northwest plant disease management handbook|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when fertilizer was applied to an infected field the infection rate per root increased from 11% (with no added nitrogen) to 36% (with 336&amp;nbsp;kg nitrogen/hectare), and sugar yields decreased.&lt;ref name=Spacing&amp;N /&gt;

===Resistance===

The bacteria can survive in the rhizosphere of other crops such as tomato, carrots, sweet potato, radish, and squash&lt;ref name=Compendium2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt; as well as weed plants like lupin and pigweed,&lt;ref name=deMendonca /&gt; so it is very hard to get rid of it completely.&lt;ref name=Ecology/&gt; When it is known that the bacterium is present in the soil, planting resistant varieties can be the best defense against the disease. Many available beet cultivars are resistant to ''Pectobacterium carotovorum'' subsp. ''betavasculorum'', and some examples are provided in the corresponding table. A comprehensive list is maintained by the USDA on the Germplasm Resources Information Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Germplasm Resources Information Network|url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/desc.pl?49076|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even though some genes associated with root defense response have been identified, the specific mechanism of resistance is unknown, and it is currently being researched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smigocki|first=A C|title=Molecular Approaches To Pest And Pathogen Resistance in Sugar Beet|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/projects/projects.htm?ACCN_NO=419874&amp;fy=2012|publisher=united states department of agriculture agricultural research service|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological control===

Some [[bacteriophage]]s, viruses that infect bacteria, have been used as effective controls of bacterial diseases in laboratory experiments. This relatively new technology is a promising control method that is currently being researched. Bacteriophages are extremely host-specific, which makes them environmentally sound as they will not destroy other, beneficial soil [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duffy|first=B|title=Biological control of bacterial diseases in field crops|journal=Symposium on Biological Control of Bacterial Plant Diseases|year=2006|pages=93–98|url=http://pub.jki.bund.de/index.php/MittBBA/article/viewFile/709/644..#page=93|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bacteriophages identified as effective controls of ''Pectobacterium carotovorum'' subsp. ''betavasculorum'' are the strains ΦEcc2 ΦEcc3 ΦEcc9 ΦEcc14. When mixed with a fertilizer and applied to inoculated calla lily bulbs in a greenhouse, they reduced diseased tissue by 40 to 70%.&lt;ref name=phages&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ravensdale|first=M |author2=T. Blom |author3=J. A. Gracia-Garza |author4=R. J. Smith |author5=A. M. Svircev|title=Bacteriophages of and the control of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora.|journal=Canadian Journal of Plant Pathology|year=2007|volume=29|issue=2|pages=121–130|doi=10.1080/07060660709507448}}&lt;/ref&gt; ΦEcc3 appeared to be the most effective, reducing the percent of diseased plants from 30 to 5% in one trial, to 50 to 15% in a second trial.&lt;ref name=phages/&gt;  They have also been used successfully to reduce rotting in lettuce caused by ''Pectobacterium carotovorum'' subsp. ''carotovorum'', a different bacterial species closely related to the one that causes beet vascular necrosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lim|first=J.A.|author2=Jee S|author3=Lee DH|author4=Roh E|author5=Jung K|author6=Oh C|author7=Heu S.|title=Biocontrol of Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum using bacteriophage PP1.|journal=Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology|year=2013|volume=23|issue=8|pages=1147–1153|doi=10.4014/jmb.1304.04001|pmid=23727798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is more difficult to apply bacteriophages in a field setting, it is not impossible, and laboratory and greenhouse trials are showing bacteriophages to potentially be a very effective control mechanism. However, there are a few obstacles to surmount before field trials can begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frampton|first=Rebekah A.|author2=Andrew R. Pitman|author3=Peter C. Fineran|title=Advances in Bacteriophage-Mediated Control of Plant Pathogens|journal=International Journal of Microbiology|year=2012|doi=10.1155/2012/326452|pmid=22934116|pmc=3426239|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijmicro/2012/326452/|volume=2012|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large problem is that they are damaged by UV light, so applying the phage mixture during the evening will help promote its viability. Also, providing the phages with susceptible non-pathogenic bacteria to replicate with can ensure there is adequate persistence until the bacteriophages can spread to the targeted bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Jeffrey B |author2=Gary E. Vallad |author3=Fanny B. Iriarte |author4=Aleksa Obradović |author5=Mine H. Wernsing |author6=Lee E. Jackson |author7=Botond Balogh |author8=Jason C. Hong |author9=M.

Thus it is recommended that multiple strains of the bacteriophage be used in each application so the bacteria do not have a chance to develop resistance to any one strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Balogh|first=B|author2=Jones, Jeffrey B. |author3=Iriarte, F.

== Importance ==

The disease was first identified in the western states of, California, Washington, Texas, Arizona and Idaho in the 1970s and initially led to substantial yield losses in those areas.&lt;ref name=Spacing&amp;N /&gt; ''Erwinia caratovara'' subsp ''betavascularum'' was not discovered in Montana until 1998.  When it first appeared, beet vascular necrosis caused individual farm yield loss ranging from 5–70% in Montana's Bighorn Valley.&lt;ref name=Zidack /&gt;  Today, yield losses from the disease are generally infrequent and patchy as most producers plant resistant varieties. Infection rate is generally low if resistant cultivars are chosen; however, warmer and wetter conditions can lead to higher than normal instance of disease&lt;ref name=Zidack /&gt;

If infection does occur, bacterial root rots can not only cause economic losses in the field, but also can in storage and processing as well.&lt;ref name=Strasbaugh /&gt;  In processing plants, rotten roots complicate slicing and the bacterially-produced slime can clog filters. This is especially problematic with late-infected beets which are generally harvested and processed along with healthy beets. The disease can also lower sugar-content which greatly reduces the quality&lt;ref name=WhitneyLewellen /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7169">In [[type theory]], a theory within [[mathematical logic]], the '''bottom type''' is the type that has no values. It is also called the '''zero''' or '''empty''' type, and is sometimes denoted with [[falsum]] (⊥).

A function whose return type is bottom cannot return any value. In the [[Curry–Howard correspondence]], the bottom type corresponds to falsity.

==Computer science applications==

In subtyping systems, the bottom type is the subtype of all types.&lt;ref name="bounded"&gt;{{cite paper | citeseerx = 10.1.1.17.9230 | last = Pierce | first = Benjamin C. | year = 1997 | title = Bounded Quantification with Bottom }}&lt;/ref&gt; (However, the converse is not true—a [[Subtyping|subtype]] of all types is not necessarily the bottom type.) It is used to represent the return type of a function that does not return a value: for instance, one which loops forever, signals an exception, or exits.

Because the bottom type is used to indicate the lack of a normal return, it typically has no values. It contrasts with the [[top type]], which spans all possible values in a system, and a [[unit type]], which has exactly one value.

The bottom type is frequently used for the following purposes:
* To signal that a function or computation ''diverges''; in other words, does not return a result to the caller.  (This does not necessarily mean that the program fails to terminate; a subroutine may terminate without returning to its caller, or exit via some other means such as a [[continuation]].)
** When coupled with the [[Curry–Howard correspondence]] interpretation of bottom as "falsity", this yields a computational interpretation of [[non-constructive logic]] in terms of [[control flow]] operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Griffin | first1=Timothy G. | title=Conf. Record 17th Annual ACM Symp. on Principles of Programming Languages, POPL '90, San Francisco, CA, USA, 17-19 Jan 1990 | year=1990 | chapter=The Formulae-as-Types Notion of Control | pages=47–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As an indication of error; this usage primarily occurs in theoretical languages where distinguishing between errors is unimportant.  Production programming languages typically use other methods, such as [[option type]]s (including [[tagged pointer]]s) or [[exception handling]].

In ''Bounded Quantification with Bottom'',&lt;ref name="bounded" /&gt; Pierce says that "Bot" has many uses:

# In a language with [[Exception handling|exceptions]], a natural type for the raise construct is ''raise&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;exception&amp;nbsp;-&gt;&amp;nbsp;Bot'', and similarly for other control structures.  Intuitively, Bot here is the type of computations that do not return an answer.
# Bot is useful in typing the "leaf nodes" of polymorphic data structures. For example, List(Bot) is a good type for nil.
# Bot is a natural type for the "[[null pointer]]" value (a pointer which does not point to any object) of languages like Java: in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], the ''null type'' is the universal subtype of reference types. &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; is the only value of the null type; and it can be cast to any reference type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl = http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se5.0/html/typesValues.html#4.1 | title = Java Language Specification | edition = 3rd | chapter = Section 4.1: The Kinds of Types and Values }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the null type does not satisfy all the properties of a bottom type as described above, because bottom types cannot have any possible values, and the null type has the value &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;.
# A type system including both Top and Bot seems to be a natural target for [[type inference]], allowing the constraints on an omitted type parameter to be captured by a pair of bounds: we write S&lt;:X&lt;:T to mean "the value of X must lie somewhere between S and T." In such a scheme, a completely unconstrained parameter is bounded below by Bot and above by Top.

==In programming languages==
Most commonly used languages don't have a way to explicitly denote the empty type.  There are a few notable exceptions.

[[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] does not support empty data types. However, in [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]], there is a flag &lt;code&gt;-XEmptyDataDecls&lt;/code&gt; to allow the definition &lt;code&gt;data Empty&lt;/code&gt; (with no constructors). The type &lt;code&gt;Empty&lt;/code&gt; is not quite empty, as it contains non-terminating programs and the &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; constant. The &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; constant is often used when you want something to have the empty type, because &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; matches any type (so is kind of a "subtype" of all types), and attempting to evaluate &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; will cause the program to abort, therefore it never returns an answer.

In [[Common Lisp]] the symbol &lt;code&gt;NIL&lt;/code&gt;, amongst its other uses, is also the name of a type that has no values. It is the complement of &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; which is the top type. The type named &lt;code&gt;NIL&lt;/code&gt; is sometimes confused with the type named &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, which has one value, namely the symbol &lt;code&gt;NIL&lt;/code&gt; itself.

In [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], the bottom type is denoted as &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;.  Besides its use for functions that just throw exceptions or otherwise don't return normally, it's also used for [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|covariant]] [[Parametric polymorphism#Parametric polymorphism|parameterized types]].  For example, Scala's List is a covariant type constructor, so &lt;code&gt;List[Nothing]&lt;/code&gt; is a subtype of &lt;code&gt;List[A]&lt;/code&gt; for all types A.  So Scala's &lt;code&gt;Nil&lt;/code&gt;, the object for marking the end of a list of any type, belongs to the type &lt;code&gt;List[Nothing]&lt;/code&gt;.

In [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], the bottom type is denoted by &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;. It is present in the type signature of functions guaranteed to never return, for example by calling &lt;code&gt;panic!()&lt;/code&gt; or looping forever.

In [[Ceylon (programming language)|Ceylon]], the bottom type is &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | access-date = 2017-02-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is comparable to &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; in Scala and represents the intersection of all other types as well as an empty set.

In [[TypeScript]], the bottom type is &lt;code&gt;never&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript output|date=2018-02-01|url=https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43515">In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], a '''copula''' is a multivariate probability distribution for which the [[marginal probability]] distribution of each variable is [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]]. Copulas are used to describe the [[Dependent and independent variables|dependence]] between [[random variable]]s. Their name comes from the Latin for "link" or "tie", similar but unrelated to grammatical [[Copula (linguistics)|copulas]] in [[linguistics]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}.  Copulas have been used widely in quantitative finance to model and minimize tail risk&lt;ref name="Banking 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Low|first1=R.K.Y.|last2=Alcock|first2=J.|last3=Faff|first3=R.|last4=Brailsford|first4=T.|title=Canonical vine copulas in the context of modern portfolio management: Are they worth it?|journal=Journal of Banking &amp; Finance|date=2013|volume=37|issue=8|doi= 10.1016/j.jbankfin.2013.02.036}}&lt;/ref&gt; and portfolio optimization applications.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Low|first1=R.K.Y.|last2=Faff|first2=R.|last3=Aas|first3=K.|title=Enhancing mean–variance portfolio selection by modeling distributional asymmetries|journal=Journal of Economics and Business|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.jeconbus.2016.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abe Sklar|Sklar]]'s theorem states that any multivariate [[cumulative distribution function#Multivariate case|joint distribution]] can be written in terms of univariate [[marginal distribution|marginal-distribution]] functions and a copula which describes the dependence structure between the variables.

Copulas are popular in high-dimensional statistical applications as they allow one to easily model and estimate the distribution of random vectors by estimating marginals and copulae separately. There are many parametric copula families available, which usually have parameters that control the strength of dependence. Some popular parametric copula models are outlined below.

Two-dimensional copulas are known in some other areas of mathematics under the name ''permutons'' and ''doubly-stochastic measures''.

==Mathematical definition==
Consider a random vector &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose its marginals are continuous, i.e. the marginal [[Cumulative distribution function|CDFs]] &lt;math&gt;F_i(x) = \mathrm{Pr}[X_i\leq x] &lt;/math&gt; are continuous functions. By applying the [[probability integral transform]] to each component, the random vector
:&lt;math&gt;(U_1,U_2,\dots,U_d)=\left(F_1(X_1),F_2(X_2),\dots,F_d(X_d)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
has [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly]] distributed marginals.

The copula of &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[cumulative distribution function#Multivariate case|joint cumulative distribution function]] of &lt;math&gt;(U_1,U_2,\dots,U_d)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;C(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_d)=\mathrm{Pr}[U_1\leq u_1,U_2\leq u_2,\dots,U_d\leq u_d] .&lt;/math&gt;

The copula ''C'' contains all information on the dependence structure between the components of &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt; whereas the marginal cumulative distribution functions &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; contain all information on the marginal distributions.

The importance of the above is that the reverse of these steps can be used to generate [[pseudo-random]] samples from general classes of [[multivariate probability distribution]]s. That is, given a procedure to generate a sample &lt;math&gt;(U_1,U_2,\dots,U_d)&lt;/math&gt; from the copula distribution, the required sample can be constructed as
:&lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d) = \left(F_1^{-1}(U_1),F_2^{-1}(U_2),\dots,F_d^{-1}(U_d)\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The inverses &lt;math&gt;F_i^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; are unproblematic as the &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; were assumed to be continuous. The above formula for the copula function can be rewritten to correspond to this as:
:&lt;math&gt;C(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_d)=\mathrm{Pr}[X_1\leq F_1^{-1}(u_1),X_2\leq F_2^{-1}(u_2),\dots,X_d\leq F_d^{-1}(u_d)] .&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition==

In [[probability theory|probabilistic]] terms, &lt;math&gt;C:[0,1]^d\rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a ''d''-dimensional '''copula''' if ''C'' is a joint [[cumulative distribution function]] of a ''d''-dimensional random vector on the [[unit cube]] &lt;math&gt;[0,1]^d&lt;/math&gt; with [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] [[marginal distribution|marginals]].&lt;ref name="nelsen"&gt;{{Citation |first=Roger B. |last=Nelsen |year=1999 |title=An Introduction to Copulas |location=New York |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-98623-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Multivariable calculus|analytic]] terms, &lt;math&gt;C:[0,1]^d\rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a ''d''-dimensional '''copula''' if
:* &lt;math&gt;C(u_1,\dots,u_{i-1},0,u_{i+1},\dots,u_d)=0 &lt;/math&gt;, the copula is zero if one of the arguments is zero,
:*  &lt;math&gt;C(1,\dots,1,u,1,\dots,1)=u &lt;/math&gt;, the copula is equal to ''u'' if one argument is ''u'' and all others 1,
:* ''C'' is ''d''-non-decreasing, i.e., for each [[hyperrectangle]] &lt;math&gt;B=\prod_{i=1}^{d}[x_i,y_i]\subseteq [0,1]^d &lt;/math&gt; the ''C''-volume of ''B'' is non-negative:
:*:&lt;math&gt; \int_B dC(u) =\sum_{\mathbf z\in \times_{i=1}^{d}\{x_i,y_i\}} (-1)^{N(\mathbf z)} C(\mathbf z)\ge 0,&lt;/math&gt;
::where the &lt;math&gt;N(\mathbf z)=\#\{k : z_k=x_k\}&lt;/math&gt;.

For instance, in the bivariate case, &lt;math&gt;C:[0,1]\times[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a bivariate copula if &lt;math&gt;C(0,u) = C(u,0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C(1,u) = C(u,1) = u &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C(u_2,v_2)-C(u_2,v_1)-C(u_1,v_2)+C(u_1,v_1) \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;0 \leq u_1 \leq u_2 \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \leq v_1 \leq v_2 \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Sklar's theorem==
[[File:Gaussian copula gaussian marginals.png|thumb|Density and contour plot of a Bivariate Gaussian Distribution]]
[[File:Biv gumbel dist.png|thumb|Density and contour plot of two Normal marginals joint with a Gumbel copula]]

Sklar's theorem,&lt;ref name="Sklar 1959"&gt;{{citation | last=Sklar | first=A. | authorlink = Abe Sklar | title=Fonctions de répartition à n dimensions et leurs marges | journal=Publ. Inst. Statist. Univ. Paris | year=1959 | volume=8 | pages=229–231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Abe Sklar]], provides the theoretical foundation for the application of copulas.
Sklar's theorem states that every [[cumulative distribution function#Multivariate case|multivariate cumulative distribution function]]
:&lt;math&gt;H(x_1,\dots,x_d)=\mathrm{Pr}[X_1\leq x_1,\dots,X_d\leq x_d]&lt;/math&gt;
of a random vector &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in terms of its marginals &lt;math&gt;F_i(x_i) = \mathrm{Pr}[X_i\leq x_i] &lt;/math&gt; and
a copula &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x_1,\dots,x_d) = C\left(F_1(x_1),\dots,F_d(x_d) \right). &lt;/math&gt;

In case that the multivariate distribution has a density &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, and this is available, it holds further that
:&lt;math&gt;h(x_1,\dots,x_d)= c(F_1(x_1),\dots,F_d(x_d))\cdot f_1(x_1)\cdot\dots\cdot f_d(x_d),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the copula.

The theorem also states that, given &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, the copula is unique on &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Ran}(F_1)\times\cdots\times \operatorname{Ran}(F_d) &lt;/math&gt;, which is the [[cartesian product]] of the [[Range (mathematics)|ranges]] of the marginal cdf's. This implies that the copula is unique if the marginals &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; are continuous.

The converse is also true: given a copula &lt;math&gt;C:[0,1]^d\rightarrow [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; and margins &lt;math&gt;F_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;C\left(F_1(x_1),\dots,F_d(x_d) \right)&lt;/math&gt; defines a ''d''-dimensional cumulative distribution function.

==Fréchet–Hoeffding copula bounds==
[[File:copule ord.svg|thumb|right|Graphs of the bivariate Fréchet–Hoeffding copula limits and of the independence copula (in the middle).]]

The Fréchet–Hoeffding Theorem (after [[Maurice René Fréchet]] and [[Wassily Hoeffding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hoeffding.html |title=Biography of Wassily Hoeffding |author="J J O'Connor and E F Robertson" |date= March 2011 |publisher= School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) states that for any Copula &lt;math&gt;C:[0,1]^d\rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;(u_1,\dots,u_d)\in[0,1]^d&lt;/math&gt; the following bounds hold:
: &lt;math&gt;W(u_1,\dots,u_d) \leq C(u_1,\dots,u_d) \leq M(u_1,\dots,u_d).&lt;/math&gt;
The function '''W''' is called lower Fréchet–Hoeffding bound and is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; W(u_1,\ldots,u_d) = \max\left\{1-d+\sum\limits_{i=1}^d {u_i} , 0 \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The function '''M''' is called upper Fréchet–Hoeffding bound and is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; M(u_1,\ldots,u_d) = \min \{u_1,\dots,u_d\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The upper bound is sharp: ''M'' is always a copula, it corresponds to [[comonotonicity|comonotone random variables]].

The lower bound is point-wise sharp, in the sense that for fixed '''u''', there is a copula &lt;math&gt;\tilde{C}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{C}(u) = W(u)&lt;/math&gt;. However, ''W'' is a copula only in two dimensions, in which case it corresponds to countermonotonic random variables.

In two dimensions, i.e. the bivariate case, the Fréchet–Hoeffding Theorem states
: &lt;math&gt;\max(u+v-1,0) \leq C(u,v) \leq \min\{u,v\}&lt;/math&gt;

==Families of copulas==

Several families of copulas have been described.

===Gaussian copula===
[[File:Copula gaussian.svg|thumb|Cumulative and density distribution of Gaussian copula with ''ρ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.4]]

The Gaussian copula is a distribution over the unit cube &lt;math&gt;[0,1]^d&lt;/math&gt;. It is constructed from a [[multivariate normal distribution]] over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; by using the [[probability integral transform]].

For a given [[correlation matrix]] &lt;math&gt;R\in[-1, 1]^{d\times d}&lt;/math&gt;, the Gaussian copula with parameter matrix &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can be written as
:&lt;math&gt; C_R^{\text{Gauss}}(u) = \Phi_R\left(\Phi^{-1}(u_1),\dots, \Phi^{-1}(u_d) \right), &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Phi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse cumulative distribution function of a standard normal and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_R&lt;/math&gt; is the joint cumulative distribution function of a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector zero and covariance matrix equal to the correlation matrix &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. While there is no simple analytical formula for the copula function, &lt;math&gt;C_R^{\text{Gauss}}(u)&lt;/math&gt;, it can be upper or lower bounded, and  approximated using numerical integration.&lt;ref name="bo16"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Botev|first1=Z. I.|title=The normal law under linear restrictions: simulation and estimation via minimax tilting|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B|date=2016|doi=10.1111/rssb.12162|arxiv=1603.04166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cran.r-project.org/package=TruncatedNormal|title=TruncatedNormal: Truncated Multivariate Normal|first=Zdravko I.|last=Botev|date=10 November 2015|publisher=|via=R-Packages}}&lt;/ref&gt; The density can be written as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Philipp |last=Arbenz |year=2013 |title=Bayesian Copulae Distributions, with Application to Operational Risk Management—Some Comments |journal=Methodology and Computing in Applied Probability |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=105–108 |doi=10.1007/s11009-011-9224-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; c_R^{\text{Gauss}}(u)
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\det{R}}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}
\begin{pmatrix}\Phi^{-1}(u_1)\\ \vdots \\ \Phi^{-1}(u_d)\end{pmatrix}^T \cdot
\left(R^{-1}-I\right) \cdot
\begin{pmatrix}\Phi^{-1}(u_1)\\ \vdots \\ \Phi^{-1}(u_d)\end{pmatrix}
\right), &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt; is the identity matrix.

===Archimedean copulas===

Archimedean copulas are an associative class of copulas. Most common Archimedean copulas admit an explicit formula, something not possible for instance for the Gaussian copula.
In practice, Archimedean copulas are popular because they allow modeling dependence in arbitrarily high dimensions with only one parameter, governing the strength of dependence.

A copula '''C''' is called Archimedean if it admits the representation&lt;ref name="Nelsen 2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nelsen |first=R. B. |year=2006 |title=An Introduction to Copulas, Second Edition |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media Inc. |location=New York, NY 10013, USA |isbn=978-1-4419-2109-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; C(u_1,\dots,u_d;\theta) = \psi^{[-1]}\left(\psi(u_1;\theta)+\cdots+\psi(u_d;\theta);\theta\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\psi\!:[0,1]\times\Theta \rightarrow [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous, strictly decreasing and convex function such that &lt;math&gt;\psi(1;\theta)=0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter within some parameter space &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is the so-called generator function and &lt;math&gt;\psi^{[-1]}&lt;/math&gt; is its pseudo-inverse defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \psi^{[-1]}(t;\theta) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \psi^{-1}(t;\theta) &amp; \mbox{if }0 \leq t \leq \psi(0;\theta) \\ 0 &amp; \mbox{if }\psi(0;\theta) \leq t \leq\infty. \end{array}\right. &lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the above formula for '''C''' yields a copula for &lt;math&gt;\psi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\psi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is [[d-monotone function|d-monotone]] on &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McNeil |first=A. J. |last2=Nešlehová |first2=J. |year=2009 |title=Multivariate Archimedean copulas, ''d''-monotone functions and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{l}&lt;/math&gt;1-norm symmetric distributions |journal=[[Annals of Statistics]] |volume=37 |issue=5b |pages=3059–3097 |doi=10.1214/07-AOS556 |arxiv=0908.3750 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
That is, if it is &lt;math&gt;d-2&lt;/math&gt; times differentiable and the derivatives satisfy

:&lt;math&gt; (-1)^k\psi^{-1,(k)}(t;\theta) \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;t\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k=0,1,\dots,d-2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{d-2}\psi^{-1,(d-2)}(t;\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is nonincreasing and [[convex function|convex]].

====Most important Archimedean copulas====

The following tables highlight the most prominent bivariate Archimedean copulas, with their corresponding generator.

==Expectation for copula models and Monte Carlo integration==

In statistical applications, many problems can be formulated in the following way. One is interested in the expectation of a response function &lt;math&gt;g:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; applied to some random vector &lt;math&gt;(X_1,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. McNeil, Rudiger Frey and Paul Embrechts (2005) "Quantitative Risk Management: Concepts, Techniques, and Tools", Princeton Series in Finance&lt;/ref&gt; If we denote the cdf of this random vector with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, the quantity of interest can thus be written as

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{E}\left[ g(X_1,\dots,X_d) \right] = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} g(x_1,\dots,x_d) \,  dH(x_1,\dots,x_d).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is given by a copula model, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;H(x_1,\dots,x_d)=C(F_1(x_1),\dots,F_d(x_d))&lt;/math&gt;

this expectation can be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}\left[g(X_1,\dots,X_d)\right]=\int_{[0,1]^d}g(F_1^{-1}(u_1),\dots,F_d^{-1}(u_d)) \, dC(u_1,\dots,u_d).&lt;/math&gt;

In case the copula '''C''' is [[absolutely continuous]], i.e. '''C''' has a density '''c''', this equation can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}\left[g(X_1,\dots,X_d)\right]=\int_{[0,1]^d}g(F_1^{-1}(u_1),\dots,F_d^{-1}(u_d))\cdot c(u_1,\dots,u_d) \, du_1\cdots du_d,&lt;/math&gt;
and if each marginal distribution has the density &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; it holds further that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}\left[g(X_1,\dots,X_d)\right]=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}g(x_1,\dots x_d)\cdot c(F_1(x_1),\dots,F_d(x_d))\cdot f_1(x_1)\cdots f_d(x_d) \, dx_1\cdots dx_d.&lt;/math&gt;

If copula and margins are known (or if they have been estimated), this expectation can be approximated through the following Monte Carlo algorithm:
# Draw a sample &lt;math&gt;(U_1^k,\dots,U_d^k)\sim C\;\;(k=1,\dots,n)&lt;/math&gt; of size '''n''' from the copula '''C'''
# By applying the inverse marginal cdf's, produce a sample of &lt;math&gt;(X_1,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt; by setting &lt;math&gt;(X_1^k,\dots,X_d^k)=(F_1^{-1}(U_1^k),\dots,F_d^{-1}(U_d^k))\sim H\;\;(k=1,\dots,n)&lt;/math&gt;
# Approximate &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}\left[g(X_1,\dots,X_d)\right]&lt;/math&gt; by its empirical value:
:::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}\left[g(X_1,\dots,X_d)\right]\approx \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n g(X_1^k,\dots,X_d^k)&lt;/math&gt;

==Empirical copulas==

When studying multivariate data, one might want to investigate the underlying copula. Suppose we have observations
:&lt;math&gt;(X_1^i,X_2^i,\dots,X_d^i), \, i=1,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;
from a random vector &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt; with continuous margins. The corresponding "true" copula observations would be
:&lt;math&gt;(U_1^i,U_2^i,\dots,U_d^i)=\left(F_1(X_1^i),F_2(X_2^i),\dots,F_d(X_d^i)\right), \, i=1,\dots,n.&lt;/math&gt;
However, the marginal distribution functions &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; are usually not known. Therefore, one can construct pseudo copula observations by using the empirical distribution functions
:&lt;math&gt;F_k^n(x)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{1}(X_k^i\leq x)&lt;/math&gt;
instead. Then, the pseudo copula observations are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;(\tilde{U}_1^i,\tilde{U}_2^i,\dots,\tilde{U}_d^i)=\left(F_1^n(X_1^i),F_2^n(X_2^i),\dots,F_d^n(X_d^i)\right), \, i=1,\dots,n.&lt;/math&gt;
The corresponding empirical copula is then defined as
:&lt;math&gt;C^n(u_1,\dots,u_d) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{1}\left(\tilde{U}_1^i\leq u_1,\dots,\tilde{U}_d^i\leq u_d\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The components of the pseudo copula samples can also be written as &lt;math&gt;\tilde{U}_k^i=R_k^i/n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;R_k^i&lt;/math&gt; is the rank of the observation &lt;math&gt;X_k^i&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;R_k^i=\sum_{j=1}^n \mathbf{1}(X_k^j\leq X_k^i)&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the empirical copula can be seen as the empirical distribution of the rank transformed data.

In [[quantitative finance]] copulas are applied to [[risk management]], to [[investment management|portfolio management]] and [[portfolio optimization|optimization]], and to [[derivatives pricing]].

For the former, copulas are used to perform [[Stress test (financial)|stress-tests]] and robustness checks that are especially important during "downside/crisis/panic regimes" where extreme downside events may occur (e.g., the global financial crisis of 2007–2008).  The formula was also adapted for financial markets and was used to estimate the probability distribution of losses on [[Securitization|pools of loans or bonds]].

During a downside regime, a large number of investors who have held positions in riskier assets such as equities or real estate may seek refuge in 'safer' investments such as cash or bonds. This is also known as a [[flight-to-quality]] effect and investors tend to exit their positions in riskier assets in large numbers in a short period of time. As a result, during downside regimes, correlations across equities are greater on the downside as opposed to the upside and this may have disastrous effects on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, anecdotally, we often read financial news headlines reporting the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars on the stock exchange in a single day; however, we rarely read reports of positive stock market gains of the same magnitude and in the same short time frame.

Copulas aid in analyzing the effects of downside regimes by allowing the modelling of the [[marginal distribution|marginals]] and dependence structure of a multivariate probability model separately. For example, consider the stock exchange as a market consisting of a large number of traders each operating with his/her own strategies to maximize profits. The individualistic behaviour of each trader can be described by modelling the marginals. However, as all traders operate on the same exchange, each trader's actions have an interaction effect with other traders'. This interaction effect can be described by modelling the dependence structure. Therefore, copulas allow us to analyse the interaction effects which are of particular interest during downside regimes as investors tend to [[herd behavior|herd their trading behaviour and decisions]]. (See also [[agent-based computational economics]], where price is treated as an [[emergent phenomenon]], resulting from the interaction of the various market participants, or agents.)

The users of the formula have been criticized for creating "evaluation cultures" that continued to use simple copulæ despite the simple versions being acknowledged as inadequate for that purpose.&lt;ref name = "MacKenzieSpears"&gt;{{cite techreport |last1= MacKenzie |first1= Donald |last2= Spears |first2= Taylor |title= "The Formula That Killed Wall Street"?

However, the recent development of [[vine copula]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooke|first1=R.M.|last2=Joe|first2=H.|last3=Aas|first3=K.|title=Dependence Modeling Vine Copula Handbook|date= January 2011|publisher=World Scientific|isbn= 978-981-4299-87-9|pages=37–72|url=http://rogermcooke.net/rogermcooke_files/Vines%20Arise%20Handbook%20VCM.pdf|editor1-last=Kurowicka|editor1-first=D.|editor2-last=Joe|editor2-first=H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as pair copulas) enables the flexible modelling of the dependence structure for portfolios of large dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Clayton canonical vine copula allows for the occurrence of extreme downside events and has been successfully applied in [[portfolio optimization]] and risk management applications. The model is able to reduce the effects of extreme downside correlations and produces improved statistical and economic performance compared to scalable elliptical dependence copulas such as the Gaussian and Student-t copula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Other models developed for risk management applications are panic copulas that are glued with market estimates of the marginal distributions to analyze the effects of [[financial panic|panic regimes]] on the portfolio profit and loss distribution. Panic copulas are created by [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|Monte Carlo simulation]], mixed with a re-weighting of the probability of each scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

As regards [[derivatives pricing]], dependence modelling with copula functions is widely used in applications of [[Financial risk modeling|financial risk assessment]] and [[actuarial analysis]] – for example in the pricing of [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Meneguzzo|first1=David|title=Copula sensitivity in collateralized debt obligations and basket default swaps|date=Nov 2003|journal=[[Journal of Futures Markets]]|volume=24|issue=1|pages=37–70|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;|doi=10.1002/fut.10110|id=|quote=|last2=Vecchiato|first2=Walter|authorlink=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2008-10-29 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe the methodology of applying the Gaussian copula to [[credit derivative]]s to be one of the reasons behind the [[global financial crisis of 2008–2009]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/17-03/wp_quant?currentPage=all Recipe for Disaster: The Formula That Killed Wall Street] ''Wired'', 2/23/2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Despite this perception, there are documented attempts within the financial industry, occurring before the crisis, to address the limitations of the Gaussian copula and of copula functions more generally, specifically the lack of dependence dynamics.  The Gaussian copula is lacking as it only allows for an elliptical dependence structure, as dependence is only modeled using the variance-covariance matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This methodology is limited such that it does not allow for dependence to evolve as the financial markets exhibit asymmetric dependence, whereby correlations across assets significantly increase during downturns compared to upturns.  Therefore, modeling approaches using the Gaussian copula exhibit a poor representation of [[extreme value theory|extreme events]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''''Demi-monde''''' refers to a group of people who live [[hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyles, usually in a flagrant and [[conspicuous consumption|conspicuous]] manner. The term was commonly used in Europe from the late nineteenth to the early twentieth century, and contemporary use has an anachronistic character. Its connotations of pleasure-seeking often contrasted with wealth and ruling class behavior.

The term 'demi-monde' is French for "half-world". It derives from a comedy called ''Le Demi-Monde'', by [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], published in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrehistory.com/french/dumasfils002.html |title=Le Demi-monde, a synopsis of the play by Alexander Dumas (fils)|author=Alice B. Fort &amp; Herbert S. Kates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was often used as one of disapprobation, the behavior of a person in the demimonde being contrary to more traditional or [[bourgeois]] values. Such behaviors often included drinking or drug use, gambling, high spending (particularly in pursuit of [[fashion]], as through clothing as well as servants and houses), and sexual promiscuity. The term ''demimondaine'' referred to a woman who embodied these qualities; later it became a euphemism for a [[courtesan]] or [[prostitute]].

== Decline ==
As the twentieth century dawned, changing social mores resulted in the demarginalization of the demimonde. [[Women's suffrage]] and the [[flapper]] movements resulted in the label ''demimondaine'' becoming obsolete. The term commonly used to refer to the class that became [[bohemianism|'starving artists']].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Women called demimondaine ==
Externally, the defining aspects of the demimonde were an extravagant [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] of fine food and clothes, often surpassing that of other wealthy women of their day with a steady income of cash and gifts from their various lovers. Internally, their lifestyle was an eclectic mixture of sharp business acumen, social skills, and [[hedonism]]. Intelligent demimondaines, like the fictional [[Gigi]]'s grandmother, would invest their wealth for the day when their beauty faded. Others ended up penniless and starving when age took its toll on their beauty, unless they managed to marry.

A famous beauty was [[Virginia Oldoini|Virginia Oldoini, Countess di Castiglione]], who came to Paris in the 1850s with very little money of her own and soon became mistress of [[Napoleon III]]; after that relationship ended she moved on to other wealthy men in government, finance and European royalty. She was one of the most aristocratic and exclusive of the demimondaines—reputed to have charged a member of the British aristocracy one million francs for 12 hours in her company. 

Another woman who doubtless influenced later images of the demimondaine was the dancer and adventuress [[Lola Montez]], though she died before the term came into general use.

The actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]] was the illegitimate child of a courtesan; in her day all actresses were generally considered demimondaines.  Her many lovers and extravagant lifestyle fit the type, though her genuine successes as an artist and innovator eventually gained her a kind of public esteem most demimondaines never achieved.

== Fictional demimondaine ==
Descriptions of the demimonde can be found in ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' (1848), a novel which satirizes nineteenth century society, written by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]].  Although it does not mention the terms 'demimonde' and 'demimondaine' (they were coined later), the terms were later used by reviewers and other authors in reference to three characters in it.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Lady Crackenbury and Mrs. Washington White are demimonde characters, both of whom Captain Rawdon Crawley lusts after in his younger days.  [[Becky Sharp (character)|Becky Sharp]] is perceived as a demimondaine before she is presented at court, and then becomes one when she travels through [[Europe]] after her husband abandons her.

Possibly the most famous portrayal of the demimonde, albeit from before the word was coined, is in Verdi's opera ''[[La traviata]]'' (1853). The opera, in turn, was inspired by [[Alexandre Dumas, fils|Alexandre Dumas the younger]]'s ''[[The Lady of the Camellias|La Dame aux Camélias]];'' [[The Lady of the Camellias|Marguerite Gautier]], the heroine of the book and subsequent play, was based on [[Marie Duplessis]], 1840s Paris courtesan and mistress to a number of prominent men, including Dumas.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Webber|first=Carolline|title=‘My Favors Cost a Great Deal’: ‘The Girl Who Loved Camellias,’ by Julie Kavanagh|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/books/review/the-girl-who-loved-camellias-by-julie-kavanagh.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=July 20, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In writing his 1924 play ''[[Easy Virtue (play)|Easy Virtue]]'', [[Noël Coward]] stated his object was to present a comedy in the structure of a tragedy "to compare the déclassée woman of to-day with the more flamboyant demi-mondaine of the 1890s."

[[Colette]]'s ''[[Gigi]]'' (1944) also describes the demimonde and their lifestyle.  Gigi is schooled from childhood to be a kept woman, to stifle her feelings in return for a life of ease.  "We never marry in our family", says Gigi's mother.  But Gigi finds herself a misfit in the demimonde of [[Paris]] in the '[[Gay Nineties]]', as she desires true romance with Gaston.

In ''[[The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (film)|The Seven-Per-Cent Solution]]'' (1976) the character Lola Devereaux is labeled a demimondaine by the character [[Sigmund Freud]].

== Other uses of the term in fiction ==
In [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s ''[[Without Dogma]]'' (1891), the "demimonde" refers to the affluent, pleasure-seeking portion of society, unbound by morals, religion or tradition, and is loosely analogous to the "[[Jet set|Jet Set]]" of modern times.

In Marcel Proust's ''Swann's Way'' (1913), Odette de Crécy is described as a demimondaine. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Swann's Way|last = Proust|first = Marcel|translator=C.K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin|publisher = Random House|year = 1981|isbn = 0394506448|location = New York}}{{rp|205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francoise Sagan]], in her novel ''[[Bonjour Tristesse]]'' (1954), uses the term 'demimondaine' to refer to the character Elsa, a young, stunningly attractive woman who leverages her appearance into support by wealthy men, which allows her entrance into the social-world of the upper classes.

The high society men in [[Peter Matthew Hillsman Taylor]]'s novella ''The Old Forest'' (from the story collection of the same name, 1985) use "demimonde" to refer to a group of "adventurous" and intelligent young women in 1937 Memphis, Tennessee; in the story, it is common for the men to continue courting such "demimondames" right up until the time they are married to high society women.

The term appears repeatedly in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

In [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Mars trilogy]]'' (1990s), the "demimonde" refers to a semi-tolerated, "off the net" society of commerce and education.

== In popular culture ==
*It is the namesake for the book series [[The Demi-Monde]] by Rod Rees.
*The English language title of the Hungarian feature film ''Félvilág'' is ''[[Demimonde_(film)|Demimonde]]''.

The '''doctrine of colourability''' is the idea that when a [[legislature]] wants to do something that it cannot do within the constraints of its [[government]]'s [[constitution]], it colours the law with a substitute purpose, allowing it to accomplish its original goal.

==India==
Under the [[constitution of India]],&lt;ref&gt;Book Titled "Land and the Constitution in India" has a chapter titled "Empire and Commonwealth Origins of the Doctrine of Colorability" page 209 and "Colorability" and Zamindari Abolition Laws" page 211&lt;/ref&gt; exclusive jurisdiction for the Union and the [[nation|State]] has been conferred regarding subject matters of [[legislation]]. This has been provided by Article 246,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vlex.in/vid/maganbhai-ishwarbhai-patel-union-and-29692323 |title=Case nº 1528 of Appeal, January 09, 1969 (case Maganbhai Ishwarbhai Patel VS. Union Of India And Anr.) - Maganbhai Ishwarbhai Patel VS. Union Of India And Anr. - Supreme Court of India - Id 29692323 - vLex India |publisher=Vlex.in |date= |accessdate=2014-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316201401/http://vlex.in/vid/maganbhai-ishwarbhai-patel-union-and-29692323 |archivedate=March 16, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has demarcated the legislative [[jurisdiction]] of the [[Parliament of India|parliament]] and the [[state assembly|state assemblies]] by outlining the different subjects under List I for the Union, List II for the State, and List III for both, as given in the seventh schedule to the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]]. As a consequence, conflicts of jurisdiction arise due to the fact there exist separate lists for the Union and the State to legislate upon. It often happens that strict constitutional boundaries are transgressed in legislation, inviting [[judicial review]] of the said [[Bill (law)|bill]]/[[act (law)|act]].

The [[Enactment of a bill|enactment of legislation]] is a function of the legislative power. In order to decide whether particular legislation is unconstitutional for breaching the constitutional limitations of [[Separation of powers|distribution of powers]], the Court examines the enactment with some [[strict scrutiny|strictness]]. The legislature can only make laws within its legislative competence. The legislative competence may be limited by specific List entries, or be restricted by other constitutional limitations and prohibitions. It cannot over-step the area of its legislative capability. A simple rule is followed in this regard, which is to find out if the legislating body had the power to legislate directly. If not, then the legislature cannot legislate indirectly. What it cannot do directly, it cannot attempt to do indirectly. Therefore, the substance of the legislation must be articulated for the purpose of determining whether what it enacted, it could really do. 

The question of colourable legislation was fully discussed by the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] in K.C. Gajapati Narayan Deo v. Orissa, a decision which has been treated as settling the [[law]] on the subject. This ruling was confirmed in the Supreme Court decision of Sonapur Tea Co. v. Deputy Commissioner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10848">'''Ecological civilization''' is the final goal of social and environmental reform within a given society. It implies that the changes required in response to global [[climate change|climate disruption]] and social injustices are so extensive as to represent another form of human civilization, one based on [[ecological]] principles. Broadly construed, ecological civilization involves a synthesis of economic, educational, political, agricultural, and other societal reforms toward [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"&gt;Zhihe Wang, Huili He, and Meijun Fan, [http://monthlyreview.org/2014/11/01/the-ecological-civilization-debate-in-china/ "The Ecological Civilization Debate in China: The Role of Ecological Marxism and Constructive Postmodernism—Beyond the Predicament of Legislation"], last modified 2014, ''[[Monthly Review]]'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Although the term was first coined in the 1980s, it did not see widespread use until 2007, when “ecological civilization” became an explicit goal of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC).&lt;ref name="newblueprint"&gt;Zhang Chun, [http://thediplomat.com/2015/09/chinas-new-blueprint-for-an-ecological-civilization/ "China's New Blueprint for an 'Ecological Civilization'"], last modified September 30, 2015, ''[[The Diplomat]]'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chinaturnstoecology"&gt;James Oswald, [http://asaa.asn.au/china-turns-to-ecology-in-search-of-civilisation/ "China turns to ecology in search of ‘civilisation’"], last modified August 3, 2016, ''Asian Studies Association of Australia'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, the [[United Nations Alliance of Civilizations]] and the [[International Ecological Safety Collaborative Organization]] founded a sub-committee on ecological civilization.&lt;ref name="unep"&gt;Zhu Guangyao, [http://web.unep.org/ourplanet/march-2016/articles/ecological-civilization/ "Ecological Civilization: A national strategy for innovative, concerted, green, open and inclusive development"], last modified March 2016, ''[[United Nations Environment Programme]]'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of ecological civilization agree with Pope Francis who writes, "We are faced not with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, but rather with one complex crisis which is both social and environmental. Strategies for a solution demand an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Francis |first1=Pope |title=Laudato Si': On Care for Our Common Home |page=Ch 4, #139}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, ecological civilization emphasizes the need for major environmental and social reforms that are both long-term and systemic in orientation.&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"/&gt;

==History==

In 1984, former [[Soviet Union]] environment experts proposed the term “Ecological Culture” (экологической культуры) in an article entitled “Ways of Fostering Ecological Culture in Individuals under the Conditions of Mature Socialism" which was published in ''Scientific Communism'', Moscow, vol. 2.&lt;ref name="ecoculture"&gt;Липицкий, В.

Сер. 12, ''Теория научного коммунизма'' 2 1984: p43.&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of this article was published in the Chinese newspaper the [[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]], where the notion of ecological culture was translated into Chinese as 生态文明 (shēngtài wénmíng), or ecological civilization.&lt;ref name="ecocivguang"&gt;张擅, [http://www.cqvip.com/read/read.aspx?id=49988300 “在成熟社会主义条件下培养个人生态文明的途径,”] ''光明日报'', 18th February 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, the concept of ecological civilization was picked up in China, and was first used by [[Ye Qianji]] (1909–2017), an [[agricultural economist]], in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cq.xinhuanet.com/2017-03/01/c_1120547146.htm 中国生态农业奠基人108岁叶谦吉教授在重庆仙逝]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barbarity"&gt;Arran Gare, [https://philpapers.org/archive/GARBCA.pdf], in ''Chromatikon V: Yearbook of Philosophy in Process'', ed. [[Michel Weber]] and Ronny Desmet (Louvain-la-Neuve: [[Presses universitaires de Louvain]], 2009): 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ye defined ecological civilization by drawing from the [[ecology|ecological sciences]] and [[environmental philosophy]].&lt;ref name="chinagoverning"&gt;Jiahua Pan, ''China's Environmental Governing and Ecological Civilization'' (Heidelberg: [[Springer-Verlag]] GmbH, 2016), 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first time the phrase “ecological civilization” was used as a technical term in an English-language book was in 1995.&lt;ref name="chinagoverning2"&gt;Jiahua Pan, ''China's Environmental Governing and Ecological Civilization'' (Heidelberg: [[Springer-Verlag]] GmbH, 2016), 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Roy Morrison, an environmentalist, coined the phrase in his book ''Ecological Democracy'', writing that “An ecological civilization is based on diverse lifeways sustaining linked natural and social ecologies.”&lt;ref name="ecologicaldemocracy"&gt;Roy Morrison, ''Ecological Democracy'' (Boston: [[South End Press]], 1995), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is found more extensively in Chinese discussions beginning in 2007.&lt;ref name="newblueprint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chinaturnstoecology"/&gt; In 2012, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) included the goal of achieving an ecological civilization in its constitution, and it also featured in its [[Five-year plans of China|five-year plan]].&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpost"&gt;[[John B. Fullerton]], [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-fullerton/china-ecological-civiliza_b_6786892.html "China: Ecological Civilization Rising?"], last modified May 2, 2015, ''[[Huffington Post]]'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Chinese context, the term generally presupposes the framework of a “constructive postmodernism,” as opposed to an extension of [[modernist]] practices or a “[[Postmodernism#Deconstruction|deconstructive postmodernism]],” which stems from the deconstruction of [[Jacques Derrida]].&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"/&gt;

Both “ecological civilization” and “constructive postmodernism” have been associated with the [[process philosophy]] of [[Alfred North Whitehead]].&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"/&gt; &lt;ref name="Putting Philosophy to Work"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |last2=Scwhartz |first2=Wm.

Beardslee, and Joe Holland, ''Varieties of Postmodern Theology'' (Albany, [[State University of New York Press]], 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest international conference held on the theme “ecological civilization” (''[https://www.ctr4process.org/whitehead2015/ Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization]'') took place at [[Pomona College]] in June 2015, bringing together roughly 2,000 participants from around the world and featuring such leaders in the environmental movement as [[Bill McKibben]], [[Vandana Shiva]], [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], [[Wes Jackson]], and [[Sheri Liao]].&lt;ref name="conferencereport"&gt;Herman Greene, [http://www.ecozoicsocieties.org/musings/2015/re-imagining-civilization-as-ecological-report-on-the-seizing-an-alternative-toward-an-ecological-civilization-conference/ "Re-Imagining Civilization as Ecological: Report on the 'Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization' Conference"], last modified August 24, 2015, ''Center for Ecozoic Societies'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2015, the Chinese discussion of ecological civilization is increasingly associated with an “organic” form of [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"/&gt; “Organic Marxism” was first used by [[Philip Clayton (philosopher)|Philip Clayton]] and Justin Heinzekehr in their 2014 book, ''Organic Marxism: An Alternative to Capitalism and Ecological Catastrophe''.&lt;ref name="organicmarxism"&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-05/01/c_135326965.htm "Spotlight: Organic Marxism, China's ecological civilization drive in spotlight at int'l conference"], last modified May 1, 2016, ''[[Xinhua News Agency]]'', accessed November 1, 2016. See [[Philip Clayton (philosopher)|Philip Clayton]] and Justin Heinzekehr, ''Organic Marxism: An Alternative to Capitalism and Ecological Catastrophe'' (Claremont: Process Century Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The book, which was translated into Chinese and published by the People’s Press in 2015, describes ecological civilization as an orienting goal for the global [[ecological movement]].&lt;ref name="chineseorganicmarxism"&gt;[[Philip Clayton (philosopher)|Philip Clayton]] and Justin Heinzekehr, ''Organic Marxism: An Alternative to Capitalism and Ecological Catastrophe'', trans. Xian Meng, Guifeng Yu, and Lixia Zhang (Beijing: The People's Press, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

A defence of ecological civilization as the ultimate goal of humanity, has been mounted by Arran Gare in
''The Philosophical Foundations of Ecological Civilization: A Manifesto for the Future'', &lt;ref&gt;https://www.routledge.com/The-Philosophical-Foundations-of-Ecological-Civilization-A-manifesto-for/Gare/p/book/9781138685765&lt;/ref&gt; which was published in 2016.

The concept predates this coinage, with [[Plato]] suggesting applying the principles of [[selective breeding]] to humans around 400&amp;nbsp;BCE.

[[Frederick Osborn]]'s 1937 journal article "Development of a Eugenic Philosophy"&lt;ref name="Osborn1937"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Osborn |first=Frederick |author-link=Frederick Osborn |title=Development of a Eugenic Philosophy|journal=[[American Sociological Review]]|volume=2|issue=3 |pages=389–397|date=June 1937|doi=10.2307/2084871|jstor=2084871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; framed it as a [[social philosophy]]—that is, a philosophy with implications for [[social order]]. That definition is not universally accepted. Osborn advocated for higher rates of [[sexual reproduction]] among people with desired traits (positive eugenics), or reduced rates of sexual reproduction and [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] of people with less-desired or undesired traits (negative eugenics).

Alternatively, gene selection rather than "people selection" has recently been made possible through advances in [[genome editing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= https://www.neb.com/tools-and-resources/feature-articles/crispr-cas9-and-targeted-genome-editing-a-new-era-in-molecular-biology |title=CRISPR/Cas9 and Targeted Genome Editing: A New Era in Molecular Biology |date=2014 |access-date=8 July 2015 |work=NEB Expressions |issue=I |first1=Alex |last1=Reis |first2=Breton |last2=Hornblower |first3=Brett |last3=Robb |first4=George |last4=Tzertzinis |publisher=New England Biolabs}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to what is sometimes called [[new eugenics]], also known as neo-eugenics, consumer eugenics, or liberal eugenics.

While eugenic principles have been practiced as far back in world history as [[ancient Greece]], the modern [[history of eugenics]] began in the early 20th century when a popular eugenics movement emerged in the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor=25054146 |title=Eugenic Ideas, Political Interests and Policy Variance Immigration and Sterilization Policy in Britain and U.S |date=1 January 2001 |journal=World Politics |doi=10.1353/wp.2001.0003 |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=237–263|last1=Hansen |first1=Randall |last2=King |first2=Desmond }}&lt;/ref&gt; and spread to many countries including the [[Eugenics in the United States|United States]], [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oBYvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TqgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6315,1778929 |title=Sterilization of Unfit Advocated – Feeble-minded Increasing at Disproportionate Rate in Canada – Case for Ungenics |work=The Montreal Gazette |volume=CLXII |issue=272 |date=14 November 1933 |via=News.Google.com |access-date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most [[Europe]]an countries. In this period, eugenic ideas were espoused across the political spectrum. Consequently, many countries adopted eugenic policies with the intent to improve the quality of their populations' genetic stock. Such programs included both "positive" measures, such as encouraging individuals deemed particularly "fit" to reproduce, and "negative" measures such as marriage prohibitions and forced sterilization of people deemed unfit for reproduction. People deemed unfit to reproduce often included people with mental or physical disabilities, people who scored in the low ranges of different [[IQ]] tests, criminals and deviants, and members of disfavored minority groups. The eugenics movement became negatively associated with [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Holocaust]] when many of the [[defendants]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]] attempted to justify their human rights abuses by claiming there was little difference between the [[Nazi eugenics]] programs and the [[Eugenics in the United States|U.S. eugenics]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics |first1=Alison |last1=Bashford |first2=Philippa |last2=Levine |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |url= https://books.google.com/?id=g15rfXUA2i8C&amp;pg=PA327&amp;lpg=PA327&amp;dq=eugenics+defense+nuremberg+trials#v=onepage&amp;q=eugenics%20defense%20nuremberg%20trials&amp;f=false |page=327|isbn=9780199706532 |date=2010-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the decades following [[World War II]], with the institution of [[human rights]], many countries gradually began to abandon eugenics policies, although some Western countries, among them the United States and [[Sweden]], continued to carry out forced sterilizations.

Since the 1980s and 1990s, when new [[assisted reproductive technology]] procedures became available such as [[gestational surrogacy]] (available since 1985), [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (available since 1989), and [[cytoplasmic transfer]] (first performed in 1996), fear has emerged about a possible revival of eugenics.

A major criticism of eugenics policies is that, regardless of whether "negative" or "positive" policies are used, they are susceptible to abuse because the criteria of selection are determined by whichever group is in political power at the time. Furthermore, negative eugenics in particular is considered by many to be a violation of basic human rights, which include the right to reproduction. Another criticism is that eugenic policies eventually lead to a loss of [[genetic diversity]], resulting in [[inbreeding depression]] due to lower genetic variation.

===Origin and development===

The concept of positive eugenics to produce better human beings has existed at least since [[Plato]] suggested [[Selective breeding|selective mating]] to produce a guardian class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/eugenics/ |title=Eugenics |date=2 July 2014 |access-date=2 January 2015 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sparta]], every Spartan child was inspected by the council of elders, the [[Gerousia]], which determined if the child was fit to live or not. In the early years of [[ancient Rome]], a Roman father was [[Twelve Tables|obliged by law]] to immediately kill his child if they were [[Physical disability|physically disabled]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyguide.org/ancient/12tables.html The Laws of the Twelve Tables, c.450 B.C.] "A dreadfully deformed child shall be quickly killed"
&lt;/ref&gt; Among the ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes, people who were cowardly, unwarlike or "stained with abominable [[vices]]" were put to death, usually by being drowned in swamps.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]]. [[wikisource:Germania (Church &amp; Brodribb)#XII|Germania.XII]] "Traitors and deserters are hanged on trees; the coward, the unwarlike, the man stained with abominable vices, is plunged into the mire of the morass, with a hurdle put over him."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanders |first=Karin |date=2009 |title=Bodies in the Bog and the Archaeological Imagination |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FU4H-JKPbhkC&amp;pg=PA62 |location= |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |page=62 |isbn=0226734048 |author-link= |quote=Tacitus's Germania, read through this kind of filter, became a manual for racial and sexual eugenics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The first formal negative eugenics, that is a legal provision against the birth of allegedly inferior human beings, was promulgated in Western European culture by the Christian [[Council of Agde]] in 506, which forbade marriage between cousins.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, Frances (2010) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5pXmkCf3LEIC&amp;pg=PR2-IA10&amp;dq=Eugenics+506+Agde&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjX2pys46rYAhUhJsAKHXXKAeMQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Eugenics%20506%20Agde&amp;f=false''Marriage and the Family in the Middle Ages''] New York: Harper Collins. p.ii {{isbn|9780062016737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea was also promoted by [[William Goodell (gynecologist)|William Goodell]] (1829–1894) who advocated the [[castration]] and [[Neutering|spaying]] of the [[Insanity|insane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://books.google.com/?id=WkwXAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA294&amp;dq=%22Clinical%20Notes%20on%20the%20Extirpation%20of%20the%20Ovaries%20for%20Insanity.%22William%20Goodell&amp;pg=PA295#v=onepage&amp;q=spaying%20all%20the%20insane%20women&amp;f=false |title=Clinical Notes on the Extirpation of the Ovaries for Insanity |author-link=William Goodell (gynecologist) |first=William |last=Goodell |work=The American Journal of Insanity |publisher=State Lunatic Asylum |location=Utica, New York |volume=XXXVIII |date=1881–1882 |access-date=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=A Confusing Wildness of Recommendations: G.

[[File:Francis Galton 1850s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Francis Galton]] was an early eugenicist, coining the term itself and popularizing the collocation of the words "[[nature and nurture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Francis |last=Galton |date=1874 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=_uE-bpGo2N4C&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=On men of science, their nature and their nurture |work=Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain |volume=7 |pages=227–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The idea of a modern project of improving the human population through a statistical understanding of [[heredity]] used to encourage good breeding was originally developed by [[Francis Galton]] and, initially, was closely linked to Darwinism and his theory of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Bowler 309"&gt;Bowler, Peter J., ''Evolution: The History of an Idea,'' 3rd Ed., University of California Press, 2003, pp. 308–310.&lt;/ref&gt; Galton had read his half-cousin [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], which sought to explain the development of plant and animal species, and desired to apply it to humans. Based on his biographical studies, Galton believed that desirable human qualities were hereditary traits, though Darwin strongly disagreed with this elaboration of his theory.&lt;ref name="credoreference.com"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Eugenics |first=Randall |last=Hansen |title=Eugenics: Immigration and Asylum from 1990 to Present |editor-first1=Matthew J. |editor-last1=Gibney |editor-first2=Randall |editor-last2=Hansen |date=2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |url= http://www.credoreference.com/entry/abcmigrate/eugenics |access-date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, one year after Darwin's death, Galton gave his research a name: ''eugenics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=DNA: The Secret of Life |first1=Watson |last1=James D. |last2=Berry |first2=Andrew |date=2009 |publisher=Knopf |url= https://www.amazon.com/DNA-The-Secret-Life-ebook/dp/B001PSEQAG}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the introduction of [[genetics]], eugenics became associated with [[genetic determinism]], the belief that human character is entirely or in the majority caused by genes, unaffected by education or living conditions. Many of the early geneticists were not Darwinians, and evolution theory was not needed for eugenics policies based on genetic determinism.&lt;ref name="Bowler 309" /&gt; Throughout its recent history, eugenics has remained controversial.{{sfn|Blom|2008|p = 336}}

Eugenics became an academic discipline at many colleges and universities and received funding from many sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allen |first=Garland E. |title=Was Nazi eugenics created in the US? |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=451–452 |date=2004 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400158 |pmc=1299061}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations were formed to win public support and sway opinion towards responsible eugenic values in parenthood, including the British [[Galton Institute|Eugenics Education Society]] of 1907 and the [[Society for Biodemography and Social Biology|American Eugenics Society]] of 1921. Both sought support from leading clergymen and modified their message to meet religious ideals.&lt;ref name="Baker 2014 pp. 281–302"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baker |first=G. J. |title=Christianity and Eugenics: The Place of Religion in the British Eugenics Education Society and the American Eugenics Society, c.1907–1940 |journal=Social History of Medicine |publisher=Oxford University Press |volume=27 |issue=2 |date=2014 |pages=281–302  |doi=10.1093/shm/hku008 |pmid=24778464 |pmc=4001825 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 the Anglican clergymen [[William Inge (priest)|William Inge]] and [[James Peile]] both wrote for the British [[Galton Institute|Eugenics Education Society]].

In addition to being practiced in a number of countries, eugenics was internationally organized through the [[International Federation of Eugenics Organizations]].{{sfn|Black|2003|p=240}} Its scientific aspects were carried on through research bodies such as the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]],{{sfn|Black|2003|p=286}} the Cold Spring Harbour Carnegie Institution for [[Experimental Evolution]],{{sfn|Black|2003|p=40}} and the [[Eugenics Record Office]].{{sfn|Black|2003|p=45}} Politically, the movement advocated measures such as sterilization laws.{{sfn|Black|2003|loc=Chapter 6: The United States of Sterilization}} In its moral dimension, eugenics rejected the doctrine that all human beings are born equal and redefined moral worth purely in terms of genetic fitness.{{sfn|Black|2003|p=237}} Its racist elements included pursuit of a pure "[[Nordic race]]" or "[[Aryan]]" genetic pool and the eventual elimination of "unfit" races.{{sfn|Black|2003|loc=Chapter 5: Legitimizing Raceology}}{{sfn|Black|2003|loc=Chapter 9: Mongrelization}}

Early critics of the philosophy of eugenics included the American sociologist [[Lester Frank Ward]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joan |last=Ferrante |title=Sociology: A Global Perspective |url= https://books.google.com/?id=AwnIIXI6y38C&amp;pg=PA259 |date=1 January 2010 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-8400-3204-1 |pages=259 ''ff.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; the English writer [[G. K. Chesterton]], the German-American anthropologist [[Franz Boas]], who argued that advocates of eugenics greatly over-estimate the influence of biology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turda |first=Marius |chapter=Race, Science and Eugenics in the Twentieth Century |editor1-last=Bashford |editor1-first=Alison |editor2-last=Levine |editor2-first=Philippa |title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2010 |isbn=0-19-988829-9 |pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Scottish tuberculosis pioneer and author [[Halliday Sutherland]]. Ward's 1913 article "[https://archive.org/details/jstor-2763324 Eugenics, Euthenics, and Eudemics]", Chesterton's 1917 book ''[[s:Eugenics and other Evils|Eugenics and Other Evils]]'', and Boas' 1916 article "[[s:Eugenics|Eugenics]]" (published in ''[[The Scientific Monthly]]'') were all harshly critical of the rapidly growing movement. Sutherland identified eugenists as a major obstacle to the eradication and cure of tuberculosis in his 1917 address "Consumption: Its Cause and Cure",&lt;ref&gt;"Consumption: Its Cause and Cure" An Address by Dr Halliday Sutherland on 4 September 1917, published by the Red Triangle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and criticism of eugenists and Neo-[[Malthusianism|Malthusian]]s in his 1921 book ''Birth Control'' led to a writ for libel from the eugenist [[Marie Stopes]]. Several biologists were also antagonistic to the eugenics movement, including [[Lancelot Hogben]].&lt;ref&gt;"Lancelot Hogben, who developed his critique of eugenics and distaste for racism in the period...he spent as Professor of Zoology at the University of Cape Town".  Alison Bashford and Philippa Levine, ''The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics''. Oxford; Oxford University Press, 2010 {{ISBN|0199706530}} (p.200)&lt;/ref&gt; Other biologists such as [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Ronald Fisher|R. A. Fisher]] expressed skepticism in the belief that sterilization of "defectives" would lead to the disappearance of undesirable genetic traits.&lt;ref&gt;"Whatever their disagreement on the numbers, Haldane, Fisher, and most geneticists could support Jennings's warning: To encourage the expectation that the sterilization of defectives will "solve the problem of hereditary defects, close up the asylums for feebleminded and insane, do away with prisons, is only to subject society to deception".

As a social movement, eugenics reached its greatest popularity in the early decades of the 20th century, when it was practiced around the world and promoted by governments, institutions, and influential individuals. Many countries enacted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ridley |first=Matt |author-link=Matt Ridley |title=Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters |date=1999 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-089408-5 |pages=290–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; various eugenics policies, including: genetic screenings, [[birth control]], promoting differential birth rates, [[Marriage law#Marriage restrictions|marriage restrictions]], segregation (both [[racial segregation]] and sequestering the mentally ill), [[compulsory sterilization]], [[forced abortion]]s or [[forced pregnancies]], ultimately culminating in [[genocide]].

{{Main article|Nazi eugenics}}

The scientific reputation of eugenics started to decline in the 1930s, a time when [[Ernst Rüdin]] used eugenics as a justification for the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial policies of Nazi Germany]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] had praised and incorporated eugenic ideas in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in 1925 and emulated eugenic legislation for the sterilization of "defectives" that had been pioneered in the United States once he took power.{{sfn|Black|2003|pp=274–295}} Some common early 20th century eugenics methods involved identifying and classifying individuals and their families, including the poor, mentally ill, blind, deaf, developmentally disabled, [[promiscuous women]], homosexuals, and [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial groups]] (such as the [[Romani people|Roma]] and [[Jews in Nazi Germany]]) as "degenerate" or "unfit", and therefore led to segregation, institutionalization, sterilization, [[euthanasia]], and even [[mass murder]].{{sfn|Black|2003}} The Nazi practice of euthanasia was carried out on hospital patients in the [[Aktion T4]] centers such as [[Hartheim Castle]].

By the end of [[World War II]], many discriminatory eugenics laws were abandoned, having become associated with [[Nazi Germany]].{{sfn|Black|2003}}&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. p. 18 "By the middle decades of the twentieth century, eugenics had become widely accepted throughout the whole of the economically developed world, with the exception of the [[Soviet Union]]."&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. G. Wells]], who had called for "the sterilization of failures" in 1904,&lt;ref name="jt"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jacky |last=Turner |title=Animal Breeding, Welfare and Society |publisher=Routledge |date=2010 |isbn=1844075893 |page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated in his 1940 book ''The Rights of Man: Or What are we fighting for?'' that among the [[human rights]], which he believed should be available to all people, was "a prohibition on [[mutilation]], sterilization, [[torture]], and any bodily punishment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Clapham |title=Human Rights: A Very Short Introduction' |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=2007 |isbn=9780199205523 |pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the practice of "imposing measures intended to prevent births within [a national, ethnical, racial or religious] group" fell within the definition of the new international crime of genocide, set out in the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 2 of the Convention defines genocide as any of the following acts committed with [[Genocide#Genocide as a crime|the intent to destroy, in whole or in part]], a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such as:
* Killing members of the group;
* Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
* Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
* Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
* Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
See the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] also proclaims "the prohibition of eugenic practices, in particular those aiming at selection of persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union |title=Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union |at=Article 3, Section 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the decline in discriminatory eugenics laws, some government mandated sterilizations continued into the 21st century. During the ten years President [[Alberto Fujimori]] led Peru from 1990 to 2000, 2,000 persons were allegedly involuntarily sterilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/25/world/americas/peru-sterilization/ |title= Peru will not prosecute former President over sterilization campaign |first1=Pierre |last1= Meilhan |first2=Ben |last2= Brumfield |lastauthoramp=yes|date=January 25, 2014 |website= CNN.com |publisher= [[CNN]] |access-date= 19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]] maintained its [[one-child policy]] until 2015 as well as a suite of other eugenics based legislation to reduce population size and manage fertility rates of different populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dikötter |first=F. |date=1998 |title=Imperfect Conceptions: Medical Knowledge, Birth Defects, and Eugenics in China |publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Edge |first=Geoffrey |last=Miller |title=2013: What {{em|Should}} We Be Worried About?

===Modern resurgence of interest===
Developments in [[Genetic engineering|genetic]], [[Genetic testing|genomic]], and [[Human cloning|reproductive technologies]] at the end of the 20th century have raised numerous questions regarding the ethical status of eugenics, effectively creating a [[History of eugenics#Modern eugenics, genetic engineering, and ethical re-evaluation|resurgence of interest]] in the subject.
Some, such as [[UC Berkeley]] sociologist [[Troy Duster]], claim that modern genetics is a back door to eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Epstein |first=Charles J. |title=Is modern genetics the new eugenics? |journal=Genetics in Medicine |date=1 November 2003 |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=469–475 |doi=10.1097/01.GIM.0000093978.77435.17 |url= http://www.nature.com/gim/journal/v5/n6/full/gim2003376a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is shared by White House Assistant Director for Forensic Sciences, [[Tania Simoncelli]], who stated in a 2003 publication by the Population and Development Program at [[Hampshire College]] that advances in [[pre-implantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) are moving society to a "new era of eugenics", and that, unlike the Nazi eugenics, modern eugenics is consumer driven and market based, "where children are increasingly regarded as made-to-order consumer products".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Tania |last=Simoncelli |author-link=Tania Simoncelli |title=Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis and Selection: From disease prevention to customised conception |journal=Different Takes |volume=24 |date=2003 |url=http://genetics.live.radicaldesigns.org/downloads/200303_difftakes_simoncelli.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=18 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018034037/http://genetics.live.radicaldesigns.org/downloads/200303_difftakes_simoncelli.pdf |archivedate=18 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 newspaper article, [[Richard Dawkins]] said that discussion regarding eugenics was inhibited by the shadow of Nazi misuse, to the extent that some scientists would not admit that breeding humans for certain abilities is at all possible. He believes that it is not physically different from breeding domestic animals for traits such as speed or herding skill. Dawkins felt that enough time had elapsed to at least ask just what the ethical differences were between breeding for ability versus training athletes or forcing children to take music lessons, though he could think of persuasive reasons to draw the distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=From the Afterward |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |author-link=Richard Dawkins |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |location=Glasgow |date=2006 |url= http://www.heraldscotland.com/from-the-afterword-1.836155 |access-date=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lee Kuan Yew]], the [[Founding Father]] of [[Singapore]], started promoting eugenics as early as 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blynkt.com/issue-1/eugenics-in-postcolonial-singapore |title=Eugenics in Postcolonial Singapore |first=Ying-kit |last=Chan |date=4 October 2016 |website=Blynkt.com |location=Berlin |access-date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://mustsharenews.com/lee-kuan-yew-controversies/ |title=13 Controversies of Lee Kuan Yew |date=10 March 2015 |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no specific by-line.--&gt; |website=MustShareNews.com |location=Singapore |access-date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, the United Nations' [[International Bioethics Committee]] wrote that the ethical problems of [[human genetic engineering]] should not be confused with the ethical problems of the [[History of eugenics|20th century eugenics movements]]. However, it is still problematic because it challenges the idea of human equality and opens up new forms of discrimination and stigmatization for those who do not want, or cannot afford, the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=International Bioethics Committee |title=Report of the IBC on Updating Its Reflection on the Human Genome and Human Rights |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002332/233258E.pdf |date=2 October 2015 |access-date=22 October 2015 |page=27 |quote=The goal of enhancing individuals and the human species by engineering the genes related to some characteristics and traits is not to be confused with the barbarous projects of eugenics that planned the simple elimination of human beings considered as ‘imperfect’ on an ideological basis. However, it impinges upon the principle of respect for human dignity in several ways. It weakens the idea that the differences among human beings, regardless of the measure of their endowment, are exactly what the recognition of their equality presupposes and therefore protects. It introduces the risk of new forms of discrimination and stigmatization for those who cannot afford such enhancement or simply do not want to resort to it. The arguments that have been produced in favour of the so-called liberal eugenics do not trump the indication to apply the limit of medical reasons also in this case.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transhumanism]] is often associated with eugenics, although most transhumanists holding similar views nonetheless distance themselves from the term "eugenics" (preferring "[[germinal choice]]" or "[[reprogenetics]]")&lt;ref name="Silver 1998"&gt;{{cite book |last=Silver |first=Lee M. |author-link=Lee M. Silver |title=Remaking Eden: Cloning and Beyond in a Brave New World |publisher=Harper Perennial |date=1998 |isbn=0-380-79243-5 |oclc=40094564}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid having their position confused with the discredited theories and practices of early-20th-century eugenic movements.

[[Prenatal diagnosis|Prenatal screening]] can be considered a form of contemporary eugenics because it may lead to abortions of children with undesirable traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Gareth M. |last2=Rothman |first2=Barbara Katz |date=April 2016 |title=Keeping the Backdoor to Eugenics Ajar?: Disability and the Future of Prenatal Screening |url= http://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/2016/04/stas1-1604.html|journal=AMA Journal of Ethics |publisher=American Medical Association |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=406–415 |doi= 10.1001/journalofethics.2016.18.4.stas1-1604|access-date=2 September 2016 |quote=We argue that prenatal screening (and specifically NIPT) for Down syndrome can be considered a form of contemporary eugenics, in that it effaces, devalues, and possibly prevents the births of people with the condition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term eugenics and its modern field of study were first formulated by [[Francis Galton]] in 1883,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galton |first=Francis |author-link=Francis Galton |title=Inquiries into Human Faculty and its Development |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |date=1883 |location=London |page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on the recent work of his half-cousin [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm |title=Correspondence between Francis Galton and Charles Darwin |publisher=Galton.org |access-date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-17 |work=Darwin Correspondence Project |title=The Correspondence of Charles Darwin |volume=Volume 17: 1869 |publisher=University of Cambridge |access-date=28 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124215918/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-17 |archivedate=24 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Galton published his observations and conclusions in his book ''[[Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development]]''.

The origins of the concept began with certain interpretations of [[Mendelian inheritance]] and the theories of [[August Weismann]].{{sfn|Blom|2008|pp=335–336}} The word ''eugenics'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''eu'' ("good" or "well") and the suffix ''-genēs'' ("born"), and was coined by Galton in 1883 to replace the word "[[Oneida stirpiculture|stirpiculture]]", which he had used previously but which had come to be mocked due to its perceived sexual overtones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Lester Frank |last1=Ward |first2=Emily |last2=Palmer Cape |first3=Sarah Emma |last3=Simons |title=Glimpses of the Cosmos |url= https://books.google.com/?id=KDEZAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA382 |access-date=11 April 2012 |date=1918 |publisher=G. P.

Historically, the term eugenics has referred to everything from [[prenatal care]] for mothers to forced sterilization and euthanasia.&lt;ref name="Spektorowski"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spektorowski |first1=Alberto |last2=Ireni-Saban |first2=Liza |title=Politics of Eugenics: Productionism, Population, and National Welfare |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-203-74023-1 |page=24 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=zdkdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Historically,+the+term+has+referred+to+everything+from+prenatal+care+for+mothers+to+forced+sterilization+and+euthanasia#v=onepage&amp;q=Historically%2C%20the%20term%20has%20referred%20to%20everything%20from%20prenatal%20care%20for%20mothers%20to%20forced%20sterilization%20and%20euthanasia&amp;f=false |access-date=16 January 2017 |quote=As an applied science, thus, the practice of eugenics referred to everything from prenatal care for mothers to forced sterilization and euthanasia.

[[Edwin Black]], journalist and author of ''War Against the Weak'', claims eugenics is often deemed a [[pseudoscience]] because what is defined as a genetic improvement of a desired trait is often deemed a cultural choice rather than a matter that can be determined through objective scientific inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |isbn=978-1-56858-321-1 |page=370 |last=Black |first=Edwin |title=War Against the Weak |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most disputed aspect of eugenics has been the definition of "improvement" of the human gene pool, such as what is a beneficial characteristic and what is a defect.

Early eugenists were mostly concerned with factors of perceived [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] that often correlated strongly with social class. Some of these early eugenists include [[Karl Pearson]] and [[Walter Weldon]], who worked on this at the [[University College London]].&lt;ref name="credoreference.com"/&gt;

Eugenics also had a place in medicine. In his lecture "Darwinism, Medical Progress and Eugenics", Karl Pearson said that everything concerning eugenics fell into the field of medicine. He basically placed the two words as equivalents. He was supported in part by the fact that Francis Galton, the father of eugenics, also had medical training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salgirli |first=S. G. |title=Eugenics for the doctors: Medicine and social control in 1930s Turkey |journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=281–312 |date=July 2011 |pmid=20562206 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/jrq040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugenic policies have been conceptually divided into two categories.&lt;ref name="Spektorowski"/&gt; Positive eugenics is aimed at encouraging reproduction among the genetically advantaged; for example, the reproduction of the intelligent, the healthy, and the successful. Possible approaches include financial and political stimuli, targeted demographic analyses, ''in vitro'' fertilization, egg transplants, and cloning.&lt;ref name="glad2008"&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Glad |author-link=John Glad |title=Future Human Evolution: Eugenics in the Twenty-First Century |publisher=Hermitage Publishers |date=2008 |isbn=1-55779-154-6 |url= http://www.whatwemaybe.org/txt/txt0000/Glad.John.2008.FHE.Meisenberg-abridgement.en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie [[Gattaca]] provides a fictional example of a dystopian society that uses eugenics to decided what you are capable of and your place in the world. Negative eugenics aimed to eliminate, through sterilization or segregation, those deemed physically, mentally, or morally "undesirable". This includes abortions, sterilization, and other methods of family planning.&lt;ref name = "glad2008"/&gt; Both positive and negative eugenics can be coercive; abortion for [[Fitness (biology)|fit]] women, for example, was illegal in Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pine |first=Lisa |title=Nazi Family Policy, 1933–1945 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=nW2aE5-rAMsC&amp;pg=PA19 |access-date=11 April 2012 |date=1997 |publisher=Berg |isbn=978-1-85973-907-5 |pages=19 ''ff.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Entine]] claims that eugenics simply means "good genes" and using it as synonym for genocide is an "all-too-common distortion of the social history of genetics policy in the United States." According to Entine, eugenics developed out of the [[Progressive Era]] and not "Hitler's twisted [[Final Solution]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-entine/lets-cautiously-celebrate_b_6070462.html |title=Let's (Cautiously) Celebrate the 'New Eugenics' |first=John |last=Entine |date=30 December 2014 |work=The Huffington Post |access-date=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation methods===
According to [[Richard Lynn]], eugenics may be divided into two main categories based on the ways in which the methods of eugenics can be applied.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. ''Part III. The Implementation of Classical Eugenics'' pp. 137–244 ''Part IV. The New Eugenics'' pp. 245–320&lt;/ref&gt;

*** Curtailment of benefits to welfare mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Compulsory sterilization]] of the "mentally retarded".&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 196–199. Quote: "There is, nevertheless, a good case for reviving the sterilization of the mentally retarded and criminals. It is indisputable on both empirical and theorethical ground that many of these people transmit their characteristics to their children by both genetic and environmental processes."&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Compulsory sterilization of female criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 199–201. First quote: "The rationale for this sentencing policy was that the judges considered these women unfit to rear children and that they should therefore be prevented from having more, at least for a few years." Second quote: "In these and similar cases many people will no doubt accept that the judges were right in deciding that the women were unfit mothers and likely to cause harm to any future children and that it would be desirable to prevent further pregnancies. It is preferable for these women to be put on probation conditional on temporary sterilization than to send them to prison, which in most cases would serve little useful purpose. These judges' decisions were not made ostensibly on eugenic grounds, but they furthered the eugenic objective of preventing these women from having children, at least for a limited period. The eugenic objective should be to support these judicial sentences and to promote their use more often, together with the stipulation of longer periods of contraception and, preferably, permanent sterilization"&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Compulsory sterilization of male criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 201–203. Quote: "A better alternative, from the point of view of reducing future criminal offending and the promotion of eugenics, would be for judges to offer convicted male criminals the alternatives of imprisonment or castration accompanied by probation."&lt;/ref&gt;
** Licences for parenthood.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 205–214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-08/14/time-to-restrict-human-breeding |title=It's time to consider restricting human breeding |first=Zoltan |last=Istvan |date=14 August 2014 |website=Wired.com |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |access-date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 211–213. Richard Lynn argued that to have an effective licensing program, reversible sterilization methods should be used. Those who wish to have children would obtain the licence and have the sterilization reversed. Lynn stated that the proposals made by Francis Galton, Hugh LaFollette and John Westman would not be effective from the eugenicists' viewpoint, since those without licences could still have children. The proposal by David Lykken would be only slightly effective.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Positive eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 215–224&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Baby bonus|Financial incentives to have children]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 215–217&lt;/ref&gt;

*** Taxation of the childless.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Ethical obligations of the elite.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 220–221. Quote: "While it can be confidently expected that elites would respond to financial incentives to have children and to penalties for childlessness by increasing their fertility, they might not do this to the extent that would be desired. Ideally a program of positive eugenics would increase the fertility of the elite to perhaps around four children per couple; and at the same time a complementary program of negative eugenics would reduce the fertility of those with low intelligence and psychopathic personality to zero.&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Immigration|Eugenic immigration]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 222–224. Quote: "The final strategy for the promotion of positive eugenics would consist of the acceptance of good-quality immigrants."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==
===Efficacy===
The first major challenge to conventional eugenics based upon genetic inheritance was made in 1915 by [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]. He demonstrated the event of [[Mutation|genetic mutation]] occurring outside of inheritance involving the discovery of the hatching of a [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly (''Drosophila melanogaster'')]] with white eyes from a family with red eyes.{{sfn|Blom|2008|pp=336–7}} Morgan claimed that this demonstrated that major genetic changes occurred outside of inheritance and that the concept of eugenics based upon genetic inheritance was not completely scientifically accurate.{{sfn|Blom|2008|pp=336–7}} Additionally, Morgan criticized the view that subjective traits, such as intelligence and criminality, were caused by heredity because he believed that the definitions of these traits varied and that accurate work in genetics could only be done when the traits being studied were accurately defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay5text.html|title=Social Origins of Eugenics|website=Eugenicsarchive.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Morgan's public rejection of eugenics, much of his genetic research was absorbed by eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientific Origins of Eugenics |first=Elof Axel |last=Carlson |url= http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay2text.html |access-date=3 October 2013 |work=Image Archive on the American Eugenics Movement |publisher=Dolan DNA Learning Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Retrospectives: Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era |first=Thomas C. (Tim) |last=Leonard |format=pdf |work=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=19 |issue=4 |date=Fall 2005 |pages=207–224 |url= https://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf |access-date=3 October 2013 |doi=10.1257/089533005775196642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zygosity|heterozygote]] [[Carrier testing|test]] is used for the early detection of [[Recessive trait|recessive]] hereditary diseases, allowing for couples to determine if they are at risk of passing genetic defects to a future child.&lt;ref name = "drze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drze.de/in-focus/predictive-genetic-testing/modules/heterozygote-test-screening-programmes|title=Heterozygote test / Screening programmes — DRZE|website=Drze.de|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the test is to estimate the likelihood of passing the hereditary disease to future descendants.&lt;ref name = "drze"/&gt;

Recessive traits can be severely reduced, but never eliminated unless the complete genetic makeup of all members of the pool was known, as aforementioned. As only very few undesirable traits, such as Huntington's disease, are dominant, it could be argued{{by whom|date=November 2014}} from certain perspectives that the practicality of "eliminating" traits is quite low.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

There are examples of eugenic acts that managed to lower the prevalence of recessive diseases, although not influencing the prevalence of heterozygote carriers of those diseases. The elevated prevalence of certain genetically transmitted diseases among the [[Ashkenazi Jew]]ish population ([[Tay–Sachs disease|Tay–Sachs]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[Canavan's disease]], and [[Gaucher's disease]]), has been decreased in current populations by the application of genetic screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jewishpress.com/page.do/18624/The_Book_Shelf.html |title=Fatal Gift: Jewish Intelligence and Western Civilization |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090813162344/http://www.jewishpress.com/page.do/18624/The_Book_Shelf.html |archive-date=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pleiotropy]] occurs when one [[gene]] influences multiple, seemingly unrelated [[phenotypic trait]]s, an example being [[phenylketonuria]], which is a human disease that affects multiple systems but is caused by one gene defect.&lt;ref name="Stearns"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stearns |first=F. W. |date=2010 |title=One Hundred Years of Pleiotropy: A Retrospective |url= http://www.genetics.org/content/186/3/767.abstract |journal=Genetics |volume=186 |issue=3 |pages=767–773 |doi=10.1534/genetics.110.122549 |pmid=21062962 |pmc=2975297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrzej Pękalski, from the [[University of Wrocław]], argues that eugenics can cause harmful loss of genetic diversity if a eugenics program selects a pleiotropic gene that could possibly be associated with a positive trait. Pekalski uses the example of a coercive government eugenics program that prohibits people with [[myopia]] from breeding but has the unintended consequence of also selecting against high intelligence since the two go together.&lt;ref name ="pekalski"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=A. |date=2000 |title=Effect of eugenics on the evolution of populations |url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs100510070148 |journal=European Physical Journal B |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=329–332 |doi=10.1007/s100510070148 |bibcode=2000EPJB...17..329P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of genetic diversity===
Eugenic policies could also lead to loss of [[genetic diversity]], in which case a culturally accepted "improvement" of the gene pool could very likely—as evidenced in numerous instances in isolated island populations —result in extinction due to increased vulnerability to disease, reduced ability to adapt to environmental change, and other factors both known and unknown. A long-term, species-wide eugenics plan might lead to a scenario similar to this because the elimination of traits deemed undesirable would reduce genetic diversity by definition.&lt;ref&gt;(Galton 2001, 48){{full citation needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward M. Miller]] claims that, in any one generation, any realistic program should make only minor changes in a fraction of the gene pool, giving plenty of time to reverse direction if [[unintended consequences]] emerge, reducing the likelihood of the elimination of desirable genes.&lt;ref name = "miller"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Edward M. |title=Eugenics: Economics for the Long Run |journal=Research in Biopolitics |volume=5 |pages=391–416 |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller also argues that any appreciable reduction in diversity is so far in the future that little concern is needed for now.&lt;ref name = "miller"/&gt;

While the science of genetics has increasingly provided means by which certain characteristics and conditions can be identified and understood, given the complexity of human genetics, culture, and psychology, at this point no agreed objective means of determining which traits might be ultimately desirable or undesirable. Some diseases such as [[sickle-cell disease]] and [[cystic fibrosis]] respectively confer immunity to malaria and resistance to [[cholera]] when a single copy of the recessive allele is contained within the genotype of the individual. Reducing the instance of sickle-cell disease genes in Africa where malaria is a common and deadly disease could indeed have extremely negative net consequences.

However, some [[Genetic disorder|genetic diseases]] cause people to consider some elements of eugenics.

===Ethics===
Societal and political consequences of eugenics call for a place in the discussion on the ethics behind the eugenics movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bentwich |first=M. |date=2013 |title=On the inseparability of gender eugenics, ethics, and public policy: An Israeli perspective |journal=American Journal of Bioethics |volume=13 |issue=10|pages=43–45 |doi=10.1080/15265161.2013.828128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ethical concerns regarding eugenics arise from its controversial past, prompting a discussion on what place, if any, it should have in the future. Advances in science have changed eugenics. In the past, eugenics had more to do with sterilization and enforced reproduction laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fischer |first=B. A. |date=2012 |title=Maltreatment of people with serious mental illness in the early 20th century: A focus on Nazi Germany and eugenics in America |journal=Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=200 |issue=12 |pages=1096–1100 |doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e318275d391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, in the age of a progressively mapped genome, embryos can be tested for susceptibility to disease, gender, and genetic defects, and alternative methods of reproduction such as in vitro fertilization are becoming more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoge |first1=S. K. |last2=Appelbaum |first2=P. S. |date=2012 |title=Ethics and neuropsychiatric genetics: A review of major issues |journal=International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=1547–1557 |doi=10.1017/S1461145711001982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, eugenics is no longer ''ex post facto'' regulation of the living but instead preemptive action on the unborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Witzany |first=G. |journal=EMBO Reports |title=No time to waste on the road to a liberal eugenics? |volume=17 |issue=3  |page=281 |date=2016 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.15252/embr.201541855/abstract | doi=10.15252/embr.201541855 | pmid=26882552 | pmc=4772985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this change, however, there are ethical concerns which lack adequate attention, and which must be addressed before eugenic policies can be properly implemented in the future. Sterilized individuals, for example, could volunteer for the procedure, albeit under incentive or duress, or at least voice their opinion. The unborn fetus on which these new eugenic procedures are performed cannot speak out, as the fetus lacks the voice to consent or to express his or her opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baird |first=S. L. |date=2007 |title=Designer babies: Eugenics repackaged or consumer options? |url= |journal=Technology Teacher |volume=66 |issue=7 |pages=12–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers disagree about the proper framework for reasoning about such actions, which change the very identity and existence of future persons.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web |last=Roberts |first=M. A. |title=The Nonidentity Problem |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonidentity-problem/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University|access-date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opposition====

[[Image:Eugenics Quarterly to Social Biology.jpg|thumb|In the decades after [[World War II]], the term "eugenics" had taken on a negative connotation and became increasingly unpopular within academic science. Many organizations and journals that had their origins in the eugenics movement began to distance themselves from the philosophy, as when ''Eugenics Quarterly'' became ''Social Biology'' in 1969.]]

A common criticism of eugenics is that "it inevitably leads to measures that are unethical".&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. ''The Ethical Principles of Classical Eugenics – Conclusions'' P. 241 Quote: "A number of the opponents of eugenics have resorted to the slippery slope argument, which states that although a number of eugenic measures are unobjectionable in themselves, they could lead to further measures that would be unethical. This argument is unpersuasive because all sorts of measures that are acceptable might, if taken to extremes, lead to other measures that are unacceptable."&lt;/ref&gt; Some fear future "[[Biopolitics|eugenics wars]]" as the worst-case scenario: the return of coercive state-sponsored [[genetic discrimination]] and [[Human rights violations#Human rights violations|human rights violations]] such as [[compulsory sterilization]] of persons with genetic defects, the [[euthanasia|killing of the institutionalized]] and, specifically, [[racial segregation|segregation]] and [[genocide]] of [[Social interpretations of race|''races'']]'' ''perceived as inferior.&lt;ref name="Black 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Black |first=Edwin |author-link=Edwin Black |title=War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race |publisher=Four Walls Eight Windows|date=2003 |isbn=1-56858-258-7||ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health law professor [[George Annas]] and technology law professor [[Lori Andrews]] are prominent advocates of the position that the use of these technologies could lead to such human-[[posthuman]] [[caste]] warfare.&lt;ref name="Darnovsky Crossroads"&gt;{{cite web |last=Darnovsky |first=Marcy |title=Health and human rights leaders call for an international ban on species-altering procedures |date=2001 |url= http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=2809 |access-date=February 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Annas 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author-link=George Annas |last=Annas |first=George |author2-link=Lori Andrews |last2=Andrews |first2=Lori |author3-link=Rosario Isasi |last3=Isasi |first3=Rosario |title=Protecting the endangered human: Toward an international treaty prohibiting cloning and inheritable alterations |journal=American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine |volume=28 |page=151 |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2003 book ''Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age'', [[environmental ethics|environmental ethicist]] [[Bill McKibben]] argued at length against [[germinal choice technology]] and other advanced biotechnological strategies for human enhancement. He writes that it would be morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves (or their children) in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations, such as vulnerability to [[aging]], [[maximum life span]] and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability. Attempts to "improve" themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice. He claims that human lives would no longer seem [[Meaning of life|meaningful]] in a world where such limitations could be overcome with technology. Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished, since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities. He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies, using as examples [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]], [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]] and the contemporary [[Amish]].&lt;ref name="McKibben 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=McKibben |first=Bill |author-link=Bill McKibben |title=Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age |publisher=Times Books |date=2003 |isbn=0-8050-7096-6 |oclc=237794777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Endorsement====
Some, for example [[Nathaniel C. Comfort]] from [[Johns Hopkins University]], claim that the change from state-led reproductive-genetic decision-making to individual choice has moderated the worst abuses of eugenics by transferring the decision-making from the state to the patient and their family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Eugenics Impulse|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education |first=Nathaniel |last=Comfort |date=12 November 2012 |url= http://chronicle.com/article/The-Eugenic-Impulse/135612/|access-date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comfort suggests that "the eugenic impulse drives us to eliminate disease, live longer and healthier, with greater intelligence, and a better adjustment to the conditions of society; and the health benefits, the intellectual thrill and the profits of genetic bio-medicine are too great for us to do otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Comfort |first=Nathaniel |title=The Science of Human Perfection: How Genes Became the Heart of American Medicine |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-16991-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Bioethics|bioethicist]] Stephen Wilkinson of [[Keele University]] and Honorary Research Fellow Eve Garrard at the [[University of Manchester]], claim that some aspects of modern genetics can be classified as eugenics, but that this classification does not inherently make modern genetics immoral. In a co-authored publication by Keele University, they stated that "[e]ugenics doesn't seem always to be immoral, and so the fact that PGD, and other forms of selective reproduction, might sometimes technically be eugenic, isn't sufficient to show that they're wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Eugenics and the Ethics of Selective Reproduction |first1=Stephen |last1=Wilkinson |first2=Eve |last2=Garrard |publisher=Keele University |orig-year=2013 |url= http://www.keele.ac.uk/media/keeleuniversity/ri/risocsci/eugenics2013/Eugenics%20and%20the%20ethics%20of%20selective%20reproduction%20Low%20Res.pdf |access-date=18 September 2013 |isbn=978-0-9576160-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book published in 2000, ''From Chance to Choice: Genetics and Justice'', bioethicists Allen Buchanan, Dan Brock, Norman Daniels and Daniel Wikler argued that liberal societies have an obligation to encourage as wide an adoption of eugenic enhancement technologies as possible (so long as such policies do not infringe on individuals' [[reproductive rights]] or exert undue pressures on prospective parents to use these technologies) in order to maximize [[public health]] and minimize the inequalities that may result from both natural genetic endowments and unequal access to genetic enhancements.&lt;ref name="Buchanan 2000"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buchanan |first1=Allen |last2=Brock |first2=Dan W. |last3=Daniels |first3=Norman |last4=Wikler |first4=Daniel |title=From Chance to Choice: Genetics and Justice |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-66977-4 |oclc=41211380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Original position]], a hypothetical situation developed by American philosopher [[John Rawls]], has been used as an argument for ''negative eugenics''.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, p. 147. Quote: "What Rawls says is that "Over time a society is to take steps to preserve the general level of natural abilities and to prevent the diffusion of serious defects." The key words here are "preserve" and "prevent". Rawls clearly envisages only the use of negative eugenics as a preventative measure to ensure a good basic level of genetic health for future generations. To jump from this to "make the later generations as genetically talented as possible," as Pence does, is a masterpiece of misinterpretation. This, then, is the sixth argument against positive eugenics: the Veil of Ignorance argument. Those behind the Veil in Rawls' Original Position would agree to permit negative, but not positive eugenics. This is a more complex variant of the Consent argument, as the Veil of Ignorance merely forces us to adopt a position of hypotethical consent to particular principles of justice."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harding |first=John R. |date=1991 |title=Beyond Abortion: Human Genetics and the New Eugenics |url= http://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1677&amp;context=plr |journal=Pepperdine Law Review |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=489–491 |access-date= 2016-06-02 |quote=Rawls arrives at the difference principle by considering how justice might be drawn from a hypothetical "original position.' A person in the original position operates behind a "veil of ignorance" that prevents her from knowing any information about herself such as social status, physical or mental capabilities, or even her belief system. Only from such a position of universal equality can principles of justice be drawn. In establishing how to distribute social primary goods, for example, "rights and liberties, powers and opportunities, income and wealth" and self-respect, Rawls determines that a person operating from the original position would develop two principles. First, liberties ascribed to each individual should be as extensive as possible without infringing upon the liberties of others. Second, social primary goods should be distributed to the greatest advantage of everyone and by mechanisms that allow equal opportunity to all. ... Genetic engineering should not be permitted merely for the enhancement of physical attractiveness because that would not benefit the least advantaged. Arguably, resources should be concentrated on genetic therapy to address disease and genetic defects. However, such a result is not required under Rawls' theory. Genetic enhancement of those already intellectually gifted, for example, might result in even greater benefit to the least advantaged as a result of the gifted individual's improved productivity. Moreover, Rawls asserts that using genetic engineering to prevent the most serious genetic defects is a matter of intergenerational justice. Such actions are necessary in terms of what the present generation owes to later generations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Father Time''' is the [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] depiction of [[time]].

==Description==
Father Time is usually depicted as an elderly bearded man with [[wings]], dressed in a robe and carrying a [[scythe]] and an [[hourglass]] or other timekeeping device (which represents [[arrow of time|time's]] constant one-way movement, and more generally and abstractly, [[entropy]]). This image derives from several sources, including the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] and the misattribution of [[Cronus]] (not [[Chronos]]) as the Greek Titan of human time, reaping and calendars, or the Lord of Time.

Around New Year's Eve, the media (in particular [[editorial cartoons]]) use the convenient [[Trope (literature)|trope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Luckovich Copyright 2010 Creators Syndicate |url=http://theweek.com/section/cartoon/0/210634/all-cartoons |title=Father time takes a beating – Foreign Relations Political and Editorial Cartoons |publisher=The Week |date= |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Father Time as the personification of the previous year (or "the Old Year") who typically "hands over" the duties of time to the equally allegorical [[Baby New Year]] (or "the New Year") or who otherwise characterizes the preceding year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonistgroup.com/bysubject/subjectbyartist.php?id=92&amp;sid=6259M |title=The Father Time Comics and Cartoons – Cartoonist Group – Lisa Benson's Editorial Cartoons |publisher=Cartoonist Group |date= |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=dePIXion studios www.depixion.com |url=http://editorialcartoonists.com/cartoon/display.cfm/94366/ |title=AAEC – Political Cartoons |publisher=Editorialcartoonists.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308211042/http://editorialcartoonists.com/cartoon/display.cfm/94366/ |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these depictions, Father Time is usually depicted wearing a sash with the old year's date on it.

Time (in his allegorical form) is often depicted revealing or unveiling the allegorical Truth, sometimes at the expense of a personification of Falsehood, Fraud, or Envy. This theme is related to the idea of ''veritas filia temporis'' (Time is the father of Truth).

==In popular culture==
Father Time is an established symbol in numerous cultures, and appears in a variety of art and media. In some cases, they appear specifically as Father Time, while in other cases they may have another name (such as [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]) but the characters demonstrate the attributes which Father Time has acquired over the centuries.

In [[physics]], '''fractional quantum mechanics''' is a generalization of standard [[quantum mechanics]], which naturally comes out when the Brownian-like quantum paths substitute with the Lévy-like ones in the [[Feynman path integral]]. It has been discovered by [[Nick Laskin]] who coined the term ''fractional quantum mechanics''.&lt;ref&gt;N. Laskin, (2000), [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0375-9601(00)00201-2 Fractional Quantum Mechanics and Lévy Path Integrals. ''Physics Letters'' 268A, 298-304].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals==
Standard quantum mechanics can be approached in three different ways: the [[matrix mechanics]], the [[Schrödinger equation]] and the [[Feynman path integral]].

The [[Feynman path integral]]&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Feynman and A. R. Hibbs, Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals ~McGraw-Hill, New York, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; is the path integral over Brownian-like quantum-mechanical paths. Fractional quantum mechanics has been discovered by [[Nick Laskin]] (1999) as a result of expanding the [[Feynman path integral]], from the Brownian-like to the Lévy-like quantum mechanical paths. A path integral over the Lévy-like quantum-mechanical paths results in a generalization of [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Laskin, (2000), [http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v62/i3/p3135_1 Fractional Quantum Mechanics, ''Physical Review'' E62, 3135-3145]. '' (also available online: https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1769)&lt;/ref&gt; If the [[Feynman path integral]] leads to the well known [[Schrödinger equation]], then the path integral over [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Lévy]] trajectories leads to the [[fractional Schrödinger equation]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Laskin, (2002), [http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v66/i5/e056108 Fractional Schrödinger equation, ''Physical Review'' E66, 056108 7 pages]. '' (also available online: https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206098)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lévy process]] is characterized
by the Lévy index ''α'', 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''α''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;2. At the special case when ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 the [[Lévy process]] becomes the process of [[Brownian motion]]. The fractional Schrödinger equation includes a space [[derivative]] of fractional order ''α'' instead of the second order (''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2) space derivative in the standard Schrödinger equation. Thus, the fractional Schrödinger equation is a [[fractional differential equation]] in accordance with modern terminology.&lt;ref&gt;S. G. Samko, A. A. Kilbas, and O. I. Marichev, Fractional
Integrals and Derivatives, Theory and Applications ~Gordon
and Breach, Amsterdam, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; This is the key point to launch the term [[fractional Schrödinger equation]] and more general term ''fractional quantum mechanics''. As mentioned above, at ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 the Lévy motion becomes [[Brownian motion]]. Thus, fractional quantum mechanics includes standard quantum mechanics as a particular case at ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. The quantum-mechanical path integral over the Lévy paths at ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 becomes the well-known [[Feynman path integral]] and the [[fractional Schrödinger equation]] becomes the well-known [[Schrödinger equation]].

=== Fractional Schrödinger equation ===

The [[fractional Schrödinger equation]] discovered by [[Nick Laskin]] has the following form (see, Refs.[1,3,4])

: &lt;math&gt;i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi (\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t}=D_\alpha (-\hbar
^2\Delta )^{\alpha /2}\psi (\mathbf{r},t)+V(\mathbf{r},t)\psi (\mathbf{r},t)\, &lt;/math&gt;

using the standard definitions:
*'''r''' is the 3-dimensional [[position vector]], 
*''ħ'' is the reduced [[Planck constant]], 
*''ψ''('''r''', ''t'') is the [[wavefunction]], which is the quantum mechanical function that determines the probability amplitude for the particle to have a given position '''r''' at any given time ''t'', 
*''V''('''r''', ''t'') is a [[potential energy]], 
*Δ = &amp;part;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&amp;part;'''r'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[Laplace operator]].

Further,
*''D&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a scale constant with [[dimensional analysis|physical dimension]] [D&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;] = [energy]&lt;sup&gt;1 − ''α''&lt;/sup&gt;·[length]&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;[time]&lt;sup&gt;−''α''&lt;/sup&gt;, at ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; =1/2''m'', where ''m'' is a particle mass,
*the operator (−''ħ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Δ)&lt;sup&gt;''α''/2&lt;/sup&gt; is the 3-dimensional fractional quantum Riesz derivative defined by (see, Refs.[3, 4]);

::&lt;math&gt;
(-\hbar ^2\Delta )^{\alpha /2}\psi (\mathbf{r},t)=\frac 1{(2\pi \hbar
)^3}\int d^3pe^{i \mathbf{p}\cdot \mathbf{r}/\hbar}|\mathbf{p}|^\alpha \varphi (
\mathbf{p},t),
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the wave functions in the [[position and momentum space]]s; &lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \varphi (\mathbf{p},t)&lt;/math&gt; are related each other by the 3-dimensional [[Fourier transform]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;
\psi (\mathbf{r},t)=\frac 1{(2\pi \hbar )^3}\int d^3pe^{i \mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}/\hbar}\varphi (\mathbf{p},t),\qquad \varphi (\mathbf{p},t)=\int d^3re^{-i
\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}/\hbar }\psi (\mathbf{r},t).
&lt;/math&gt;

The index ''α'' in the fractional Schrödinger equation is the Lévy index, 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''α''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;2.

=== Fractional quantum mechanics in solid state systems ===
The effective mass of states in solid state systems can depend on the wave vector k, i.e. formally one considers m=m(k). Polariton Bose-Einstein condensate modes are examples of states in solid state systems with mass sensitive to variations and locally in k fractional quantum mechanics is experimentally feasible.

[[File:X^4 - 4^x.PNG|350px|thumb|Graph of the function {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; − 4&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} over the interval [−2,+3].  Also shown are its two real roots and global minimum over the same interval.]]
In mathematics, the '''graph''' of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' is, formally, the set of all [[ordered pair]]s {{nowrap|(''x'', ''f''(''x''))}},  such that ''x'' is in the [[Domain of a function|domain of the function]] ''f'', and, in practice, the graphical representation of this set. If the function input ''x'', and the values ''f''(''x''), are [[real number|real numbers]], the graph is a [[two-dimensional graph]], and, for a [[continuous function]], is a [[curve]]. If the function input ''x'' is an ordered pair {{nowrap|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} of real numbers, the graph is the collection of all pairs {{nowrap|((''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;))}}. These pairs can be identified with the [[ordered triple]]s {{nowrap|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;))}}. For a continuous function the graph of such a function is a [[Surface (topology)|surface]].

The concept of the graph of a function is generalized to the graph of a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]. 
To test whether a graph of a relation represents a function of the first variable ''x'', one uses the [[vertical line test]]. To test whether a graph represents a function of the second variable ''y'', one uses the [[horizontal line test]]. If the function has an inverse, the graph of the inverse can be found by reflecting the graph of the original function over the line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''}}.

In [[science]], [[engineering]], [[technology]], [[finance]], and other areas, graphs are tools used for many purposes. In the simplest case one variable is plotted as a function of another, typically using [[Rectangular coordinate system|rectangular axes]]; see ''[[Plot (graphics)]]'' for details.

In the modern [[foundations of mathematics]], and, typically, in [[set theory]], a function and its graph are the same thing.&lt;ref name="Pinter2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles C Pinter|title=A Book of Set Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUT_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49|year=2014|origyear=1971|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-79549-2|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is often useful to see functions as [[Map (mathematics)|mappings]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T. M. Apostol|title=Mathematical Analysis|year=1981|publisher=Addison-Wesley|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which consist not only of the relation between input and output, but also on which set is the domain, and which set is the [[codomain|co-domain]]. For example, to say that a function is onto ([[Surjective function|surjective]]) or not the co-domain should be taken into account. The graph of a function on its own doesn't determine the co-domain. It is common&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=P. R. Halmos|title=A Hilbert Space Problem Book|year=1982|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=0-387-90685-1|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; to use both words, function and graph of a function, since even if considered the same object, they indicate viewing it from a different angle.

== Definition ==

Given a mapping &lt;math&gt;f:X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;, in other words a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; together with its domain &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and co-domain &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, the graph of the mapping is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=D. S. Bridges|title=Foundations of Real and Abstract Analysis|year=1991|publisher=Springer|page=285|isbn=0-387-98239-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the set 
:&lt;math&gt;G(f)=\{(x,f(x))|\ x\in X\}&lt;/math&gt;,
which is a subset of &lt;math&gt;X\times Y&lt;/math&gt;. The graph of the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the same set &lt;math&gt;G(f)&lt;/math&gt;, which is, in the abstract definition of a function, the same as &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; itself.

== Examples ==

=== Functions of one variable ===

[[File:Three-dimensional graph.png|right|thumb|250px|Graph of the [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'', ''y'') = sin(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) · cos(''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.]]

The graph of the function &lt;math&gt;f:\{1,2,3\}\mapsto \{a,b,c,d\}&lt;/math&gt; defined by
: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=
        \begin{cases}
              a, &amp; \text{if }x=1, \\ d, &amp; \text{if }x=2, \\ c, &amp; \text{if }x=3, 
        \end{cases}
  &lt;/math&gt;
is the set the subset of &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\}\times \{a,b,c,d\}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;G(f) = \{ (1,a), (2,d), (3,c) \}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

From the graph, the domain &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt; is recovered as the set of first component of each pair in the graph &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\}=\{x:\ \text{there exists } y,\text{ such that }(x,y)\in G(f)\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Similarly, the [[Range (mathematics)|range]] can be recovered as &lt;math&gt;\{a,c,d\}=\{y: \text{there exists }x,\text{ such that }(x,y)\in G(f)\}&lt;/math&gt;.
The codomain &lt;math&gt;\{a,b,c,d\}&lt;/math&gt;, however, cannot be determined from the graph alone.

The graph of the cubic polynomial on the [[real line]]

: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^3 - 9x \, &lt;/math&gt;

is

: &lt;math&gt; \{ (x, x^3 - 9x) : x \text{ is a real number} \}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

If this set is plotted on a Cartesian plane, the result is a curve (see figure).
{{clear}}

=== Functions of two variables ===

[[File:F(x,y)=−((cosx)^2 + (cosy)^2)^2.PNG|thumb|250px|Plot of the graph of {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'', ''y'') = −(cos(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + cos(''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;))&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, also showing its gradient projected on the bottom plane.]]

The graph of the [[trigonometric function]]

: &lt;math&gt; f(x,y) = \sin(x^2)\cos(y^2) \, &lt;/math&gt;

is

: &lt;math&gt; \{ (x, y, \sin(x^2) \cos(y^2)) : x \text{ and } y \text{ are real numbers} \}. &lt;/math&gt;

If this set is plotted on a [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions|three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system]], the result is a surface (see figure).

Oftentimes it is helpful to show with the graph, the gradient of the function and several level curves. The level curves can be mapped on the function surface or can be projected on the bottom plane.  The second figure shows such a drawing of the graph of the function:

: &lt;math&gt; f(x,y) = -(\cos(x^2) + \cos(y^2))^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

== Generalizations ==

The graph of a function is contained in a [[Cartesian product]] of sets. An X–Y plane is a cartesian product of two lines, called X and Y, while a cylinder is a cartesian product of a line and a circle, whose height, radius, and angle assign precise locations of the points. [[Fibre bundle]]s are not Cartesian products, but appear to be up close. There is a corresponding notion of a graph on a fibre bundle called a [[Section (fiber bundle)|section]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20068">'''Human branding''' or '''stigmatizing''' is the process which a mark, usually a symbol or ornamental pattern, is burned into the skin of a living person, with the intention that the resulting scar makes it permanent. This is performed using a hot or [[Freeze-branding|very cold]] [[branding iron]]. It therefore uses the physical techniques of [[livestock branding]] on a human, either with consent as a form of [[body modification]]; or under coercion, as a [[punishment]] or to identify an [[slavery|enslaved]] or otherwise oppressed person. It may also be practiced as a "rite of passage", e.g. within a tribe, or to signify membership of or acceptance into an organization.

[[File:Strike Branding.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Modern strike branding]]

==Etymology==
The English verb to ''burn'', attested since the 12th century, is a combination of [[Old Norse]] ''brenna'' "to burn, light", and two originally distinct [[Old English]] verbs: ''bærnan'' "to kindle" (transitive) and ''beornan'' "to be on fire" (intransitive), both from the [[Proto-Germanic]] root ''bren(wanan)'', perhaps from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''bhre-n-u'', from base root ''bhereu-'' "to boil forth, well up." In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''(ver)branden'' mean "to burn", ''brandmerk'' a branded mark; similarly, in [[German language|German]], ''Brandzeichen'' means "a brand" and ''brandmarken'', "to brand".

Sometimes, the word ''cauterize'' is used. This is known in English since 1541, and is derived via Medieval French ''cauteriser'' from [[Late Latin]] ''cauterizare'' "to burn or brand with a hot iron", itself from [[Greek language|Greek]] καυτηριάζειν, ''kauteriazein'', from καυτήρ ''kauter'' "burning or branding iron", from καίειν ''kaiein'' "to burn". However ''[[cauterization]]'' is now generally understood to mean a medical process – specifically to stop bleeding.

==Historical use==

===Marking the rightless===
The origin may be the ancient treatment of a [[slavery|slave]] (often without legal rights) as [[livestock]].
*[[European ethnic groups|European]], [[United States|American]] and other colonial slavers branded millions of slaves during the period of [[slave trade|trans-Atlantic enslavement]]. Sometimes there were several brandings, e.g. for the Portuguese crown and the (consecutive) private owner(s), an extra cross after baptism as well as by [[Africa]]n slave catchers.

To a slave owner it would be logical to mark such property just like cattle, more so since humans are more able to escape.
* [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] marked runaway slaves with the letters '''FGV''' (for ''fugitivus'').
* An intermediate case between formal slavery and criminal law is when a convict is branded and legally reduced, with or without time limit, to a slave-like status, such as on the [[galley]]s (in France branded GAL or TF ''travaux forcés'' 'forced labour' until 1832), in a [[penal colony]], or auctioned to a private owner.

===As punishment===
In [[criminal law]], branding with a [[branding iron|hot iron]] was a mode of punishment consisting of marking the subject as if goods or animals,  sometimes concurrently with their reduction of status in life.

Brand marks have also been used as a punishment for convicted criminals, combining [[physical punishment]], as burns are very painful, with [[public humiliation]] (greatest if marked on a normally visible part of the body) which is here the more important intention, and with the imposition of an indelible [[criminal record]].
Robbers, like runaway slaves, were marked by the Romans with the letter F (''fur''); and the toilers in the mines, and convicts condemned to figure in gladiatorial shows, were branded on the forehead for identification. Under [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] the face was not permitted to be so disfigured, the branding being on the hand, arm or calf.

The [[Acts of Sharbil]] record it applied, amongst other tortures, to a Christian between the eyes and on the cheeks in [[Parthia]]n [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] at the time of the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]] on a judge's order for refusal to sacrifice.

In the 16th century, German [[Anabaptists]] were branded with a cross on their foreheads for refusing to recant their faith and join the [[Roman Catholic]] church.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Bean Underhill]], [https://archive.org/details/martyrologyofchu01brac ''Martyrology of the Churches of Christ Commonly Called Baptists during the Era of the Reformation''], (1850), pg 118&lt;/ref&gt;

In the North-American [[Puritan]] settlements of the 17th century, men and women sentenced for [[adultery]] were branded with an "'''A'''" letter on their chest, and for other crimes, such as "'''D'''" for drunkenness and "'''B'''" for blasphemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6REfahE4TkwC&amp;pg=PA54 |title=British Colonial America: People and Perspectives|page=54|isbn=9781598840254|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|editor1=John A. Grigg|editor2=Peter C. Mancall}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2015}}

The mark in later times was also often chosen as a code for the crime (e.g. in Canadian military prisons D for [[Desertion]], BC for Bad Character; most branded men were shipped off to a [[penal colony]]){{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. Branding was used for a time by the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Surgeon and [[Oxford English Dictionary]] contributor [[William Chester Minor]] was required to brand deserters at around the time of the [[Battle of the Wilderness]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Until 1832 in [[France]], various offenses carried the additional infamy of being branded with a [[Fleur-de-lis|fleur de lis]] and [[galley-slave]]s could be branded '''GAL''' or, once the galleys were replaced by the ''bagnes'' on land, '''TF''' (''travaux forcés'', 'forced' labor, i.e. [[hard labour]]) or '''TFP''' (''travaux forcés à perpetuité'', hard labour for life).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} In most of the German-speaking states, however, branding people was unlawful. 

Following the [[Conspiracy of the Slaves]] of 1749 in [[Malta]], some slaves were branded with the letter '''R''' (for ''ribelli'') on their forehead and condemned to the galleys for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sciberras |first1=Sandro |title=Maltese History - E. The Decline of the Order of St John In the 18th Century |url=http://www.stbenedictcollege.org/stlucija/files/Sandro%20Sciberras/Form%203%20Option%20Maltese%20History/Unit%20E_%20The%20Decline%20of%20the%20Order%20+%20WS%2010p.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101204/http://www.stbenedictcollege.org/stlucija/files/Sandro%20Sciberras/Form%203%20Option%20Maltese%20History/Unit%20E_%20The%20Decline%20of%20the%20Order%20+%20WS%2010p.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-10-06 |website=St. Benedict College |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branding tended to be abolished like other judicial mutilations (with notable exceptions, such as amputation under [[sharia]] law), sooner and more widely than [[flogging]], [[caning]], and similar corporal punishments, which normally aim 'only' at pain and at worst cause stripe scars, although the most severe lashings (not uncommon in penal colonies) in terms of dosage and instrument (such as the proverbial [[knout]]) can even turn out to cause death.

===Branding in American slavery===
[[File:Slave branding iron (replica), Museum of Liverpool.jpg|thumb|A replica of a slave branding iron originally used in the Atlantic slave trade, on display at the [[Museum of Liverpool]], England.]]
[[File:Branding slaves.tif|thumb|Depiction of slave branding, from ''Illustrations of the American Anti-slavery Almanac for 1840'']]
In Louisiana, there was a "black code", or ''[[Code Noir]]'', which allowed the cropping of ears, shoulder branding, and [[hamstringing]], the cutting of tendons near the knee, as punishments for recaptured slaves. Slave owners used extreme punishments to stop flight, or escape. They would often brand the slaves' palms, shoulders, buttocks, or cheeks with a branding iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=punishments|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/sharperail/punishments|work=The Underground RailRoad: An Encyclopedia of People, Places, and Operations|publisher=Armonk: M.E. Sharpe|accessdate=Oct 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branding was sometimes used to mark recaptured runaway slaves to help the locals easily identify the runaway. Mr. Micajah Ricks, in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], was looking for his slave and described, "I burnt her with a hot iron, on the left side of her face, I tried to make the letter M."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weld|first=Theodore Dwight|title=American Slavery As It Is|year=1968|publisher=Arno Press, Inc.|location=New York|pages=21, 77, 108, 112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most slave owners would use whipping as their main method, but at other times they would use branding to punish their slaves. Another testimony explains how a slave owner in [[Kentucky]] around 1848 was looking for his runaway slave. He described her having "a brand mark on the breast something like L blotched."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howe|first=S. W.|title=Slavery As Punishment: Original Public Meaning, Cruel and Unusual Punishments and the Neglected Clause in the Thirteenth Amendment|journal=Arizona Law Review|date=Winter 2009|volume=51 Ariz.

When a slave ran away, if it was the first offense, the slave would receive no more than forty lashes. Then the second offense would be branding. The slave would have been marked with the letter R on their forehead signifying that they were a criminal, and a runaway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Higginbotham Jr.|first=A. Leon|title=In The Matter of Color Race and the American Legal Process: The Colonial Period|year=1978|publisher=Oxford University|location=New York|pages=176–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As religious initiation===
Ceremonial Branding is an integral part of religious initiation in most [[Vaishnava]] sects. References to this practice can be traced in texts such as Narad [[Panchratra]], Vaikhnasagama, [[Skanda Purana]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uttaradimath.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=638&amp;Itemid=225 |title=Tapta Mudra Dharana |publisher=Uttaradi Math |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419011436/http://www.uttaradimath.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=638&amp;Itemid=225 |archivedate=2014-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is still in vogue among Madhava sect Brahmins of [[Karnataka]] in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Udupi, July 11, DHNS : |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/175434/tapta-mudra-dharana-ceremony-held.html |title='Tapta Mudra Dharana' ceremony held |publisher=Deccanherald.com |date=2013-05-21 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Branding in Britain===
The punishment was adopted by the [[Anglo-Saxons]], and the ancient law of England authorized the penalty. By the 
[[Vagabonds Act 1547|Statute of Vagabonds (1547)]] under [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], [[Vagabond (person)|vagabond]]s and [[Romani people|Gypsies]] were ordered to be branded with a large '''V''' on the breast, and brawlers with '''F''' for "fraymaker"; slaves who ran away were branded with '''S''' on the cheek or forehead. This law was repealed in England in 1550. From the time of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], branding was inflicted for all offences which received [[Benefit of clergy]] (branding of the thumbs was used around 1600 at [[Old Bailey]] to ensure that the accused who had successfully used the Benefit of Clergy defence, by reading a passage from the Bible, could not use it more than once), but it was abolished for such in 1822. In 1698 it was enacted that those convicted of petty theft or [[larceny]], who were entitled to benefit of clergy, should be "burnt in the most visible part of the left cheek, nearest the nose." This special ordinance was repealed in 1707. [[James Nayler]], a [[Quaker]] who in the year 1655 was accused of claiming to be the [[Messiah]], convicted of [[blasphemy]] in a highly publicized trial before the Second Protectorate Parliament and had his tongue bored through and his forehead branded '''B''' for "blasphemer".

In the Lancaster criminal court a branding iron is still preserved in the dock. It is a long bolt with a wooden handle at one end and an '''M''' (malefactor) at the other; close by are two iron loops for firmly securing the hands during the operation. The brander would, after examination, turn to the judge exclaiming "A fair mark, my lord." Criminals were formerly ordered to hold up their hands before sentence to show if they had been previously convicted.

In the 18th century, cold branding or branding with cold irons became the mode of nominally inflicting the punishment on prisoners of higher rank. "When Charles Moritz, a young German, visited England in 1782 he was much surprised at this custom, and in his diary mentioned the case of a clergyman who had fought a [[duel]] and killed his man in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. Found guilty of [[manslaughter]] he was burnt in the hand, if that could be called burning which was done with a cold iron" (Markham's ''Ancient Punishments of [[Northamptonshire|Northants]]'', 1886).

Such cases led to branding becoming obsolete, and it was abolished in 1829 except in the case of [[deserters]] from the army, who were marked with the letter '''D''', not with hot irons but by [[tattoo]]ing with ink or gunpowder. Notoriously bad soldiers were also branded with '''BC''' (bad character). The British [[Mutiny Act]] of 1858 provided that the [[court-martial]] might, in addition to any other penalty, order deserters to be marked on the left side, 2&amp;nbsp;inches (5&amp;nbsp;cm) below the armpit, with the letter '''D''', such letter to be not less than an inch long. In 1879 this was abolished.

===Branding in Australia===
Offenders in Australia were subject to branding in accordance with British law. In 1826, in Hobart, Joseph Clarke was charged with manslaughter and ‘sentenced to be burnt in the hand’. In 1850, in New South Wales, deserter Daniel O’Neil was tattooed with the letter ‘D’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnard|first1=Simon|title=Convict Tattoos: Marked Men and Women of Australia|date=2016|publisher=Text Publishing|location=Melbourne|isbn=9781925410235|pages=54-55|url=https://www.textpublishing.com.au/books/convict-tattoos}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Branding in Russia===
Branding in Russia was used quite extensively in the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. Over time, red hot iron brands were gradually replaced by tattoo boards; criminals were first branded on the forehead and cheeks, later on the back and arms. Branding was totally abolished in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://murders.ru/kleymenie.html |title=Murders |publisher=Murders.ru |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Branding prostitutes===
Forced and [[Slavery|enslaved]] [[prostitutes]] are often tattooed or [[Branding iron|branded]] with a mark of their owners. Women and girls being forced into [[prostitution]] would have their boss’s name or [[gang]] symbol inked or branded with hot iron on their skin. In some organizations involved with the [[trafficking of women]] and girls like the [[mafias]] nearly all prostitutes are marked. Some [[pimps]] and [[Criminal organisation|organisations]] use their name or well-known symbol, others are using secret signs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/31/us/sex-trafficking-branding/ CNN: Old mark of slavery is being used on sex trafficking victims]&lt;/ref&gt;

The branding is both painful and [[humiliating]] for the prostitute, especially when done with a [[branding iron]], and may be also a form of [[Branding as punishment|punishment]] and of [[psychological]] submission for the prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Petala Parreira describes in her book Puta (Slut) the psychological effect of branding prostitutes in the Russian mafia. [https://portugues.free-ebooks.net/ebook/Puta Petala Parreira: Puta]. 2015, Portuguese language, p. 152 - 169, 228, 253 - 260 and 425.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some years ago the brands were usually small{{Citation needed|reason=no statistical information in source given|date=May 2018}}, only recognized by other pimps, sometimes hidden between the [[Inner lips|inner vaginal lips]], though other instances show that pimps have no issue with larger more noticeable brands &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/pictured-trafficked-prostitutes-branded-pimps-4461651 Irish Mirror: Pictured: Trafficked prostitutes BRANDED by pimps to show they ‘own’ them]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persisting practices==
* Generally voluntary, though often under severe social pressure, branding may be used as a painful form of initiation, serving both as endurance and motivation test ([[rite of passage]]) and a permanent membership mark, seen as [[male bonding]] in violent 'macho' circles. Branding is thus practiced:
** By some [[Gang|street gang]]s
** In organized crime as "stripes" to signify a violent crime that the person committed. Typically on the upper arm or upper torso.
** In [[prison]]s
** Sometimes as an extreme initiation in the increasingly less common tradition of painful [[hazing]] (otherwise mostly [[Paddle (spanking)|paddling]]).
** Some members of college fraternities and sororities voluntarily elect to be branded with their fraternity/sorority letters. This is far less common in sororities than fraternities and is especially prevalent in some historically African-American fraternities, such as [[Omega Psi Phi#"Unofficial" practices|Omega Psi Phi]].&lt;ref name=Posey&gt;Posey, Sandra, "[http://www.nyfolklore.org/pubs/voic30-3-4/burnmsgs.html Burning Messages: Interpreting African American Fraternity Brands and Their Bearers]", New York Folklore Society ''Voices'', Fall-Winter 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Branding can be used as a [[body modification|voluntary body decoration]] – a form of permanent [[body art]] rather like many [[tattoo]]s.

==Protests==
In symbolic solidarity with [[Calf 269]], protesters in [[Israel]] subjected themselves to branding on World Farm Animals Day ([[Gandhi]]'s birthday): October 2, 2012. This act was emulated by others in England and the Czech Republic.

"'''I know that I know nothing'''" is a saying derived from [[Plato]]'s account of the [[Classical Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Socrates]]. It is also called the '''Socratic paradox'''. The phrase is not one that Socrates himself is ever recorded as saying.

This saying is also connected or conflated with the [[List of oracular statements from Delphi#440 BC|answer]] to a question Socrates (according to [[Xenophon]]) or [[Chaerephon]] (according to Plato) is said to have posed to the [[Pythia]], the [[oracle of Delphi]], in which the Oracle stated something to the effect of "Socrates is the wisest."&lt;ref&gt;H. Bowden,  ''Classical Athens and the Delphic Oracle: Divination and Democracy'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SoSJLj3O3tYC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=Chaerophon+asked+the+Oracle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gAw4VYOBOZXjauPTgYAK&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Chaerophon%20asked%20the%20Oracle&amp;f=false p. 82].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The phrase, originally&lt;!--see talk page section: "Original Greek"--&gt; from [[Latin]] ("''{{lang|la|ipse se nihil scire id unum sciat}}''"&lt;ref&gt;"He himself thinks he knows one thing, that he knows nothing"; [[Cicero]], ''Academica'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0032%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D16 Book I, section 16].&lt;/ref&gt;), is a possible paraphrase from a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] text (see below). It is also quoted as "''{{lang|la|scio me nihil scire}}''" or "''{{lang|la|scio me nescire}}''".&lt;ref&gt;A variant is found in [[Nicholas of Cusa|von Kues]], ''De visione Dei'', XIII, 146 (''Werke'', Walter de Gruyter, 1967, p. 312): "''...et hoc scio solum, quia scio me nescire {{sic}}...'' [I know alone, that (''or'' because) I know, that I do not know]."&lt;/ref&gt; It was later [[Back-translation|back-translated]]&lt;!--see talk page section: "Original Greek"--&gt; to [[Katharevousa Greek]] as "{{lang|grc|[ἓν οἶδα ὅτι] οὐδὲν οἶδα}}", [''èn oîda óti''] ''oudèn oîda'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.translatum.gr/forum/index.php?topic=918.0 Translatum: The Greek Translation Vortal – Topic: All I know is that I know nothing]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Plato ==
The saying, though widely attributed to Plato's Socrates in both ancient and modern times, actually occurs nowhere in Plato's works in this form.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Fine, "Does Socrates Claim to Know that He Knows Nothing?", ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'' vol. 35 (2008), pp. 49–88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two prominent Plato scholars have recently argued that the claim should not be attributed to Plato's Socrates.&lt;ref&gt;Fine argues that "it is better not to attribute it to him" ("Does Socrates Claim to Know that He Knows Nothing?", ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'' vol. 35 (2008), p. 51). C. C. W. Taylor has argued that the "paradoxical formulation is a clear misreading of Plato" (''Socrates'', Oxford University Press 1998, p. 46).&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence that Socrates does not actually claim to know nothing can be found at ''Apology'' 29b-c, where he claims twice to know something. See also ''Apology'' 29d, where Socrates indicates that he is so confident in his claim to knowledge at 29b-c that he is willing to die for it.

In ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', Plato relates that Socrates accounts for his seeming wiser than any other person because he does not imagine that he knows what he does not know.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Plato, ''Apology'' 21d.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{lang|grc|[…] ἔοικα γοῦν τούτου γε σμικρῷ τινι αὐτῷ τούτῳ σοφώτερος εἶναι, ὅτι ἃ μὴ οἶδα οὐδὲ οἴομαι εἰδέναι.}}
&lt;br&gt;[…] I seem, then, in just this little thing to be wiser than this man at any rate, that what I do not know I do not think I know either.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The context in which this passage occurs should be considered; Socrates having gone to a "wise" man, and having discussed with him, withdraws and thinks the above to himself. Socrates, since he denied any kind of knowledge, then tried to find someone wiser than himself among politicians, poets, and craftsmen. It appeared that politicians claimed wisdom without knowledge; poets could touch people with their words, but did not know their meaning; and craftsmen could claim knowledge only in specific and narrow fields. The interpretation of the Oracle's answer might be Socrates' awareness of his own ignorance.&lt;ref name="PlatoKaplan2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Plato|author2=Morris Kaplan|title=The Socratic Dialogues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSous9E-3CwC&amp;pg=PR9|date=2009|publisher=Kaplan Publishing|isbn=978-1-4277-9953-1|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates also deals with this phrase in Plato's dialogue ''[[Meno]]'' when he says:&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'' 80d1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{lang|grc|καὶ νῦν περὶ ἀρετῆς ὃ ἔστιν ἐγὼ μὲν οὐκ οἶδα, σὺ μέντοι ἴσως πρότερον μὲν ᾔδησθα πρὶν ἐμοῦ ἅψασθαι, νῦν μέντοι ὅμοιος εἶ οὐκ εἰδότι.}}
&lt;br&gt;[So now I do not know what virtue is; perhaps you knew before you contacted me, but now you are certainly like one who does not know.] (trans. [[George Grube|G. M. A. Grube]])
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, Socrates aims at the change of Meno's opinion, who was a firm believer in his own opinion and whose claim to knowledge Socrates had disproved.

It is essentially the question that begins "[[Pre-Socratic|post-Socratic]]" Western philosophy. Socrates begins all wisdom with wondering, thus one must begin with admitting one's ignorance. After all, Socrates' dialectic method of teaching was based on that he as a teacher knew nothing, so he would derive knowledge from his students by dialogue.

There is also a passage by [[Diogenes Laertius]] in his work ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' where he lists, among the things that Socrates used to say:&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius II.32.&lt;/ref&gt; "{{lang|grc|εἰδέναι μὲν μηδὲν πλὴν αὐτὸ τοῦτο εἰδέναι}}", or "that he knew nothing except that he knew that very fact (i.e. that he knew nothing)".

Again, closer to the quote, there is a passage in Plato's ''Apology'', where Socrates says that after discussing with someone he started thinking that:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{lang|grc|τούτου μὲν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐγὼ σοφώτερός εἰμι· κινδυνεύει μὲν γὰρ ἡμῶν οὐδέτερος οὐδὲν καλὸν κἀγαθὸν εἰδέναι, ἀλλ᾽ οὗτος μὲν οἴεταί τι εἰδέναι οὐκ εἰδώς, ἐγὼ δέ, ὥσπερ οὖν οὐκ οἶδα, οὐδὲ οἴομαι· ἔοικα γοῦν τούτου γε σμικρῷ τινι αὐτῷ τούτῳ σοφώτερος εἶναι, ὅτι ἃ μὴ οἶδα οὐδὲ οἴομαι εἰδέναι.}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am wiser than this man, for neither of us appears to know anything great and good; but he fancies he knows something, although he knows nothing; whereas I, as I do not know anything, so I do not fancy I do. In this trifling particular, then, I appear to be wiser than he, because I do not fancy I know what I do not know.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Alternative usage ==
"Socratic paradox" may also refer to statements of Socrates that seem contrary to common sense, such as that "no one desires evil"&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Irwin]], ''The Development of Ethics'', vol. 1, Oxford University Press 2007, p. 14; Gerasimos Santas, "The Socratic Paradoxes", ''Philosophical Review'' 73 (1964), pp. 147–64.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Socrates#Socratic paradoxes|Socratic paradoxes]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3506">An '''integrative level''', or '''level of organization''', is a set of phenomena [[emergence|emerging]] from pre-existing phenomena of a lower level. The levels concept is an intellectual framework for structuring reality. It arranges all material entities and all processes in the universe into a hierarchy based on how complex the entity's organization is. When arranged this way, each entity is three things at the same time: It is made up of parts from the previous level below. It is a whole in its own right. And it is a part of the whole that is on the next level above. Typical examples include [[life]] emerging from non-living substances, and [[consciousness]] emerging from [[nervous system]]s. 

==Levels==
The main levels usually acknowledged are those of [[matter]], [[life]], [[mind]], and [[society]]. These are called ''strata'' in [[Nicolai Hartmann]]'s ontology. They can be further analyzed into more specific ''layers'', such as those of particles, atoms, molecules, and rocks forming the material stratum, or those of cells, organisms, populations, and ecosystems forming the life stratum.

The sequence of levels is often described as one of increasing [[complexity]], although it is not clear whether this is always true: for example, [[parasitism]] emerges on pre-existing organisms, although parasites are often simpler than their originating forms.

==Philosophies==

Ideas connected to integrative levels can be found in the works of both [[materialism|materialist]] philosophers,  and [[Idealism|anti-materialist]] ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14329">{{hatnote|This article concerns the discipline of intellectual history, and not its object, the whole span of human thought. For clarifications about the [[Global intellectual history|latter topic]], please consult the writings of the [[Intellectual history#Prominent individuals|intellectual historians listed here]] and entries on individual thinkers.}}

'''Intellectual history''' refers to the [[historiography]] of ideas and thinkers.  This [[history]] cannot be considered without the knowledge of the humans who created, discussed, wrote about, and in other ways were concerned with ideas. Intellectual history as practiced by [[historian]]s is parallel to the [[history of philosophy]] as done by philosophers, and is more akin to the [[history of ideas]]. Its central premise is that ideas do not develop in isolation from the people who create and use them, and that one must study ideas not as abstract propositions but in terms of the culture, lives, and historical contexts that produced them.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, "The history of ideas: Precept and practice, 1950-2000 and beyond." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 67#1 (2006): 1-32. [http://sydney.edu.au/intellectual-history/documents/grafton-history-ideas.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual history aims to understand ideas from the past by understanding them in context. The term "context" in the preceding sentence is ambiguous: it can be political, cultural, intellectual, and social. One can read a text both in terms of a chronological context (for example, as a contribution to a discipline or tradition as it extended over time) or in terms of a contemporary intellectual moment (for example, as participating in a debate particular to a certain time and place). Both of these acts of contextualization are typical of what intellectual historians do, nor are they exclusive. Generally speaking, intellectual historians seek to place concepts and texts from the past in multiple contexts.

It is important to realize that intellectual history is not just the history of intellectuals. It studies ideas as they are expressed in texts, and as such is different from other forms of [[cultural history]] which deal also with visual and other non-verbal forms of evidence. Any written trace from the past can be the object of intellectual history. The concept of the "[[intellectual]]" is relatively recent, and suggests someone professionally concerned with thought. Instead, anyone who has put pen to paper to explore his or her thoughts can be the object of intellectual history. A famous example of an intellectual history of a non-canonical thinker is [[Carlo Ginzburg]]'s study of a 16th-century Italian miller, [[Menocchio]], in his seminal work ''The Cheese and the Worms''.

Although the field emerged from European disciplines of ''[[Kulturgeschichte]]'' and ''[[Geistesgeschichte]]'', the historical study of ideas has engaged not only western intellectual traditions but others as well, including those in other parts of the world. Increasingly, historians are calling for a [[Global intellectual history]] that will show the parallels and interrelations in the history of thought of all human societies. Another important trend has been the [[history of the book]] and of reading, which has drawn attention to the material aspects of how books were designed, produced, distributed, and read.

==Intellectual historiography==
Intellectual history as a self-conscious discipline is a relatively recent phenomenon. It has precedents, however, in the [[history of philosophy]], the [[history of ideas]], and in [[cultural history]] as practiced since [[Jacob Burckhardt|Burckhardt]] or indeed since [[Voltaire]]. The history of the human mind, as it was called in the eighteenth century, was of great concern to scholars and philosophers, and their efforts can in part be traced to [[Francis Bacon]]’s call for what he termed a literary history in his [[The Advancement of Learning]]. In economics, [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883-1946) was both a historian of economic thought himself,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[John Maynard Keynes]], ''Essays in Biography'', Macmillan, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; and the subject of study by historians of economic thought because of the significance of the [[Keynesian revolution]].&lt;ref&gt; E.g. [[Peter Clarke (historian)]], ''The Keynesian Revolution in the Making, 1924-1936'', 1988. [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the discipline of intellectual history as it is now understood emerged only in the immediate postwar period, in its earlier incarnation as "the [[history of ideas]]" under the leadership of [[Arthur Lovejoy]], the founder of the [[Journal of the History of Ideas]]. Since that time, Lovejoy's formulation of "unit-ideas" has been discredited and replaced by more nuanced and more historically sensitive accounts of intellectual activity, and this shift is reflected in the replacement of the phrase [[history of ideas]] by ''intellectual history''.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Richter,  "Begriffsgeschichte and the History of Ideas." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1987): 247-263. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709557 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual history includes the history of thought in many disciplines, such as the [[history of philosophy]], and the [[history of economic thought]]. Analytical concepts - such as the nature of paradigms and the causes of paradigm shifts - have been borrowed from the study of other disciplines, exemplified by the use of the ideas of [[Thomas Kuhn]] about [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] to explain revolutions in thought in economics and other disciplines.&lt;ref&gt; E.g. Ghanshyam Mehta, ''The structure of the Keynesian Revolution'', 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain the [[history of political thought]] has been a particular focus since the late 1960s and is associated especially with [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|historians at Cambridge]], such as  [[John Dunn (political theorist)|John Dunn]] and [[Quentin Skinner]]. They studied European political thought in its historical context, emphasizing the emergence and development of such concepts as the state and freedom. Skinner in particular is renowned for his provocative methodological essays, which were and are widely read by philosophers and practitioners of other humanistic disciplines, and did much to give prominence to the practice of intellectual history.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Richter, "Reconstructing the history of political languages: Pocock, Skinner, and the Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe." History and Theory (1990): 38-70. [http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/122486/bdf9f28ccd0e5fa91c1b6dae307c0eed.pdf?sequence=1 online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United States, intellectual history is understood more broadly to encompass many different forms of intellectual output, not just the history of political ideas, and it includes such fields as the history of historical thought, associated especially with [[Anthony Grafton]] of [[Princeton University]] and [[J.G.A. Pocock]] of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Formalized in 2010, the History and Culture Ph.D. at [[Drew University]] is one of a few graduate programs in the US currently specializing in intellectual history, both in its American and European contexts. Despite the prominence of early modern intellectual historians (those studying the age from the [[Renaissance]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), the intellectual history of the modern period has also been the locus of intense and creative output on both sides of the Atlantic. Prominent examples of such work include [[Louis Menand]]'s ''[[The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America|The Metaphysical Club]]'' and [[Martin Jay]]'s ''[[The Dialectical Imagination]]''.

In continental Europe, equivalents of intellectual history can be found. An example is [[Reinhart Koselleck]]’s ''Begriffsgeschichte'' (history of concepts), though there are methodological differences between the work of Koselleck and his followers and the work of Anglo-American intellectual historians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3668">{{distinguish|Inner product}}

In [[mathematics]], the '''interior product''' ({{aka}} '''interior derivative''', '''interior multiplication''', '''inner multiplication''', '''inner derivative''', or '''inner derivation''') is a [[graded algebra|degree]] &amp;minus;1 [[antiderivation]] on the [[exterior algebra]] of [[differential form]]s on a [[smooth manifold]]. The interior product, named in opposition to the [[exterior product]], should not be confused with an [[inner product]]. The interior product ''ι''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;''ω'' is sometimes written as {{nowrap|''X'' ⨼ ''ω''}}.&lt;ref&gt;The character ⨼ is U+2A3C in [[Unicode]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

The interior product is defined to be the [[tensor contraction|contraction]] of a [[differential form]] with a [[vector field]].  Thus if ''X'' is a vector field on the [[manifold]] ''M'', then 
:&lt;math&gt;\iota_X\colon \Omega^p(M) \to \Omega^{p-1}(M)&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[Map (mathematics)|map]] which sends a ''p''-form ''ω'' to the (''p''&amp;minus;1)-form ''ι''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;''ω'' defined by the property that
:&lt;math&gt;( \iota_X\omega )(X_1,\ldots,X_{p-1})=\omega(X,X_1,\ldots,X_{p-1})&lt;/math&gt;
for any vector fields ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''−1&lt;/sub&gt;.

The interior product is the unique [[derivation (algebra)|antiderivation]] of degree &amp;minus;1 on the [[exterior algebra]] such that on one-forms ''α''
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\iota_X \alpha = \alpha(X) = \langle \alpha,X \rangle&lt;/math&gt;,
where {{nowrap|⟨ , ⟩}} is the [[duality pairing]] between ''α'' and the vector ''X''.  Explicitly, if ''β'' is a ''p''-form and γ is a ''q''-form, then
:&lt;math&gt; \iota_X(\beta\wedge\gamma) = (\iota_X\beta)\wedge\gamma+(-1)^p\beta\wedge(\iota_X\gamma). &lt;/math&gt;
The above relation says that the interior product obeys a graded [[Product rule|Leibniz rule]]. An operation satisfying linearity and a Leibniz rule is often called a derivative.

==Properties==
By antisymmetry of forms, 

:&lt;math&gt; \iota_X \iota_Y \omega = - \iota_Y \iota_X \omega &lt;/math&gt;

and so &lt;math&gt; \iota_X \circ \iota_X = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. This may be compared to the [[exterior derivative]] ''d'', which has the property {{nowrap|1=''d'' ∘ ''d'' = 0}}.

The interior product relates the [[exterior derivative]] and [[Lie derivative]] of differential forms by &lt;span id="Cartan formula"&gt;'''Cartan formula''' (a.k.a. '''Cartan identity''', '''Cartan homotopy formula'''&lt;ref&gt;Tu, Sec 20.5.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Cartan magic formula''')&lt;/span&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal L_X\omega = d(\iota_X \omega) + \iota_X d\omega. &lt;/math&gt;

This identity defines a duality between the exterior and interior derivatives. Cartan's identity is important in [[symplectic geometry]] and [[general relativity]]: see [[moment map]].&lt;ref&gt;There is another formula called "Cartan formula". See [[Steenrod algebra]].&lt;/ref&gt; Cartan homotopy formula is named after [[Élie Cartan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Is "Cartan's magic formula" due to Élie or Henri? | url=https://mathoverflow.net/q/39540 | accessdate=2018-06-25 | date=2010-09-21 |publisher=[[mathoverflow]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The interior product with respect to the commutator of two vector fields &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the identity
:&lt;math&gt; \iota_{[X,Y]}= \left[ \mathcal{L}_X, \iota_Y \right] . &lt;/math&gt;

'''''Apis mellifera ligustica''''' is the '''Italian bee''' which is a [[subspecies]] of the [[western honey bee]] (''Apis mellifera'').

==Origin==
The Italian honey bee is thought to originate from the continental part of Italy, south of the [[Alps]], and north of [[Sicily]]. The [[subspecies]] may have survived the last [[Ice Age]] in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Franck, P; Garnery, L.; Celebrano G.; Solignac M.; Cornuet J.  [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-294x.2000.00945.x/full  Hybrid origins of honeybees from Italy (Apis mellifera ligustica) and Sicily (A. m. sicula)]
Article first published online: 25 DEC 2001; Molecular Ecology Volume 9,  Issue 7,  pages 907–921, July 2000
&lt;/ref&gt;
It is genetically a different subspecies than that from the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]] and from Sicily. It is the most widely distributed of all [[honey bee]]s, and has proven adaptable to most [[climate]]s from [[subtropical]] to cool temperate, but it is less successful in humid [[tropical]] regions. It is sometimes called the [[Liguria]]n bee.

Italian bees, having been conditioned to the warmer climate of the central [[Mediterranean]], are less able to cope with the "hard" winters and cool, wet springs of more northern [[latitude]]s. They do not form such tight [[winter cluster]]s. More food has to be consumed to compensate for the greater heat loss from the loose cluster. The tendency to raise broods late in autumn also increases food consumption. The noted beekeeper, [[Thomas White Woodbury]], first introduced the Italian bee to Britain in 1854 and regarded it as vastly superior to the [[European dark bee|English Black]].

==Anatomy==
* Color: Abdomen has brown and yellow bands. Among different strains of Italian bees, there are three different colors: Leather; bright yellow (golden); and very pale yellow (Cordovan).
* Size: Their bodies are smaller and their overhairs are shorter than those of the darker honeybee races.
* Tongue length: 6.3 to 6.6&amp;nbsp;mm
* Mean [[cubital index]]: 2.2 to 2.5

==Disease resistance==
There is no clear evidence that ''A. m. ligustica'' is more resistant to acarine mites than the [[Apis mellifera mellifera|Northern dark bee]]. They also appear to be less tolerant of ''[[Nosema (fungus)|Nosema]]'' than Northern dark bees. They are unable to retain [[faeces]] in the gut for long periods and require more frequent cleaning flights than the dark bees. They are affected by the [[parasite|parasitic]] [[varroa mite]], [[diseases of the honey bee#Acarine mites (Tracheal mites)|Tracheal Mites]], and the bacterial diseases [[diseases of the honey bee#European foulbrood|European Foulbrood]], [[diseases of the honey bee#American foulbrood|American Foul Brood]], [[diseases of the honey bee#Chalkbrood|Chalkbrood]] and other [[diseases of the honey bee]].

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Bees bearding.JPG|thumbnail|right|Italian honey bees [[bearding]] outside the [[beehive (beekeeping)|hive]] entrance]]
[[File:Swarm of Italian bees 2004.jpg|thumb|Italian honey bees swarming]]
[[File:Ligustica italian bee with pollen.jpg|thumb|Italian honey bee carrying pollen from flowers]]

[[Brother Adam]], a bee breeder and developer of the [[Buckfast bee|Buckfast]] bee, characterized the Italian bee in his book ''Breeding the Honeybee'':
{{quote|text=From the commercial and breeding point of view the value of the Ligustica lies in a happy synthesis of a great number of good characteristics. Among these we must mention industry, gentleness, fertility, reluctance to swarm, zeal for building comb, white honey-cappings, a willingness to enter supers, cleanliness, resistance to disease, and the tendency to collect flower honey rather than honey dew. The last-named trait is of value only in countries where the colour of the honey determines the price. The Ligustica has shown that she is able to produce good crops from the red clover. In one other characteristic has the Ligustica proved exceptional and that is in her resistance to Acarine. This is especially true of the dark, leather-coloured variety, whereas the golden strains are highly susceptible to Acarine. |sign=Brother Adam|source="Breeding the Honeybee" (Northern Bee Books: Mytholmroyd, 1987), pp. 96-98.}}

While the Italian bee has many strong points, among the ''A.m. ligustica'' it has a large number of weak points:

{{quote|text=The Ligustica has her drawbacks, and these are serious. She lacks vitality and is inclined to excessive brood rearing. These two faults are the root cause of her other disadvantages. She has too a tendency to drift which is caused by a poor sense of orientation and this can prove a drawback where colonies are set out in rows facing in one direction as is the common practice in apiaries almost world-wide....

Curiously enough, all the above mentioned faults of the Ligustica appear in greatly emphasised form in the very light coloured strains, with an additional one, an unusually high consumption of stores. In European countries such strains have proved highly unsatisfactory as they tend to turn every drop of honey into brood. These light coloured varieties are likewise as already stated unusually susceptible to Acarine. The reason for this is not known in spite of all the work spent on trying to find it. It is all the more surprising when we consider that the dark, leather-coloured Ligustica has over a period of more than 60 years proved to be one of the most resistant to Acarine.

The almost exclusive concentration of these light-coloured Italian strains in North America seems to be due to the fact that in sub-tropical Southern and Western States the large queen-rearing centres are concerned mainly with the sale of bees, where honey production plays a secondary role. Hence they need a bee which is given to brood rearing to an extreme degree, something which in entirely different climatic conditions constitutes a serious drawback. |sign=Brother Adam|source="Breeding the Honeybee" (Northern Bee Books: Mytholmroyd, 1987), pp. 97-98.}}

*cleanliness/excellent housekeeper (which some scientists think might be a factor in disease resistance)
*uses little propilis
*excellent foragers
*superb comb builder (writing in Switzerland in 1862, H. C. Hermann stated the comb of an Italian bee-cell occupied only 15 cells for every 16 of the common black bee, and the cubic content was larger by 30%)
*covers the [[honey]] with brilliant white cappings
*shows lower swarming tendency than other [[Western honey bee]] races
*for areas with continuous nectar flow and favorable weather throughout the summer
*industry
*gentleness
*a willingness to enter supers
*tendency to collect flower honey rather than honey dew (of value only in countries where the colour of the honey determines the price)&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Brother Adam, "Breeding the Honeybee" (Northern Bee Books: Mytholmroyd, 1987), pp. 96-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weaknesses===
*lacks vitality
*inclined to excessive brood rearing
*susceptibility to disease
*high consumption of stores&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
*more prone to drifting and [[robbing]] than the other principal races of Europe.
*the strong brood rearing disposition often results in large food consumption in late winter or early spring that causes spring dwindling and hence slow or tardy spring development
*brood rearing starts late and lasts long into late summer or autumn, irrespective of nectar flow
*tends to forage over shorter distances than either ''[[Apis mellifera carnica|carnica]]'' or ''mellifera'', and may therefore be less effective in poorer nectar flows
*for cool maritime regions
*for areas with strong spring flow
*for areas with periods of dearth of nectar in the summer

==Foraging behavior==

''A. m. ligustica'' are more concerned with nectar processing behaviors, honey storage, and adult maintenance over brood expansion when compared to the African honey bee, [[African bee|''A. m. scutellata'']].&lt;ref name="Fewell and Bertram, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fewell|first=Jennifer H.|author2=Susan M. Bertram|title=Evidence for genetic variation in worker task performance by African and European honeybees|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=2002|volume=52|issue=4|pages=318–25|doi=10.1007/s00265-002-0501-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selective breeding==
Breeders of Italian bees, as well as other honey bee races, look for certain beneficial characteristics. Depending on the breeding goal, one or more of the following characteristics may be emphasized:

#Gentleness or excitability
#Resistance to various diseases including tracheal mite and Varroa mite
#Early spring buildup in population
#Wintering ability
#Tendency to limited swarming
#Ability to ripen honey rapidly
#Honeycomb cappings are white
#Minimal use of propolis
#Availability and queen cost
#Color

*1854 introduced into the United Kingdom
*1859 introduced to the United States
*1862 introduced to Australia, on 9 December into Victoria aboard the steam ship [[Alhambra (1855)|''Alhambra'']] There is strong evidence this introduction failed as the emerging Italian virgin queens hybridised with the English 'black' bee (source: Barrett, P. "The Immigrant Bees, 1788 to 1898", Vol. IV). Wilhelm Abram brought several queens from Italy to Sydney in December 1880 but it's probable they reached New South Wales through other hands earlier on.
*1866 introduced to [[Russian Empire]]
*1880 introduced to New Zealand
*1884 (Easter) introduced to [[Kangaroo Island]] in South Australia, sourced from Brisbane where they were previously imported in 1880 from Italy by Chas. Fullwood. Jas. Carroll received a hive of Italian bees in Brisbane, Queensland, in 1877 when Angus Mackay accompanied a hive aboard the City of New York, packaged by Harbison in California. After a week's stopover in Sydney, the bees arrived in Brisbane.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, P. "The Immigrant Bees, 1788 to 1898", Vols. I-III)&lt;/ref&gt; Honey from Kangaroo Island is marketed (in 2014) as being from the only pure Ligurian bees in the world.

In [[mathematics]], particularly [[topology]], a [[topological space]] ''X'' is '''locally regular''' if intuitively it looks locally like a [[regular space]]. More precisely, a locally regular space satisfies the property that each point of the space belongs to an open subset of the space that is regular under the [[subspace topology]]. 

==Formal definition==

A [[topological space]] ''X'' is said to be '''locally regular''' [[if and only if]] each point, ''x'', of ''X'' has a [[neighbourhood]] that is [[regular space|regular]] under the [[subspace topology]]. Equivalently, a space ''X'' is locally regular if and only if the collection of all open sets that are regular under the subspace topology forms a base for the topology on ''X''.

==Examples and properties==

* Every locally regular [[T0 space]] is [[Locally Hausdorff space|locally Hausdorff]].
* A regular space is always locally regular.
* A [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] is regular, hence locally regular.
* A [[T1 space]] need not be locally regular as the set of all real numbers endowed with the [[cofinite topology]] shows.

'''Leon Camille Marius Croizat''' (July 16, 1894 – November 30, 1982) was a [[France|French]]-[[Italy|Italian]] scholar and botanist who developed an [[orthogenesis|orthogenetic]] synthesis of evolution of biological form over space, in time, which he named [[Panbiogeography]].

==Life==
Croizat was born in [[Turin|Torino]], [[Italy]] to [[Vittorio Croizat]] (aka Victor Croizat) and Maria (Marie) Chaley, who had emigrated to Turin from Chambéry, France.&lt;ref name=Llor/&gt; In spite of his great aptitude for the natural sciences, Leon studied and received a degree in Law from the University of Turin.

Croizat and his family (wife Lucia and two children) emgirated to the United States in 1924; an avid artist, Leon worked selling his artwork for several years, but could not succeed economically as a working artist after the stock market crash of 1929. During the 1930s, Croizat found a job identifying plants as part of a topographic inventory performed in the public parks of New York City. During his visits to the Bronx Botanical Gardens, he became acquainted with Dr. E. D. Merrill. When Merrill was appointed director of the [[Arnold Arboretum]] of [[Harvard University]] in 1936, he hired Leon as a technical assistant (in 1937.)&lt;ref name=Llor/&gt;

Croizat became a prolific student and publisher, studying important aspects of the distribution and evolution of biological species. It was during this time that he began to formulate a novel current of thought in evolutionary theory, opposed in some respects to [[Darwinism]], on the evolution and dispersal of biota over space, through time.

In 1947, Croizat moved to [[Venezuela]] after receiving an invitation from botanist [[Henri François Pittier|Henri Pittier]]. Croizat then obtained a position in the Faculty of the Department of Agronomy at the [[Central University of Venezuela]]. In 1951 he was promoted and was awarded the title of Professor of Botany and Ecology at the [[University of the Andes, Venezuela]]. Between 1951 and 1952 he participated in the Franco-Venezuelan expedition to discover the sources of the [[Orinoco]] river. Croizat served with the expedition as a botanist with professor [[José Cruxent|Jose Maria Cruxent]].

During his time in Venezuela Croizat divorced his first wife. Croizat was later remarried to his second wife Catalina  Krishaber, a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] immigrant. In 1953 Croizat gave up all official academic positions to work full-time researching biology. Croizat and his wife Catalina lived in [[Caracas]] until 1976. In 1976 they took over as first directors of the [http://www.sciencebuff.org/research/current-research-activities/john-grehan/evolutionary-biography/jardin-botanico-xerofito/ “Jardin Botanico Xerofito”] in [[Santa Ana de Coro|Coro]], a city approximately 400 kilometers West of Caracas. Jardin Botanico Xerofito was a botanical garden which they founded together. Croizat and Catalina worked for six years to establish Jardin Botanico Xerofito.

Croizat died at Coro on November 30, 1982 of a heart attack. During his life, Croizat has published around 300 scientific papers and seven books, amounting to more than 15,000 printed pages. He was honoured by Venezuela with the Henri Pittier Order of Merit in Conservation, and by the government of Italy with the Order of Merit.

==Concepts==
[[Image:biogeographic tracks.jpg|thumb|upright|Panbiogeographic tracks of the [[ratite]] birds, the southern beech ''[[Nothofagus]]'', and the New Zealand frog ''[[Leiopelma]]'']]
[[Panbiogeography]] is a discipline based on the analysis of patterns of distribution of organisms. The method analyzes biogeographic distributions through the drawing of tracks, and derives information from the form and orientation of those tracks. A track is a line connecting collection localities or disjunct areas of a particular [[taxon]]. Several individual tracks for unrelated groups of organisms form a generalized ('standard') track, where the individual components are relict fragments of an ancestral, more widespread biota fragmented by geological and/or climatic changes. A node arises from the intersection of two or more generalized tracks &lt;ref name=Craw1999&gt;Craw RC, Grehan JR, Heads MJ (1999). ''Panbiogeography: Tracking the History of Life''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[graph theory]] a track is equated to a [[minimum spanning tree]] connecting all localities by the shortest path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Page RDM|year=1987|title=Graphs and generalized tracks: quantifying Croizat's panbiogeography|url=|journal=Systematic Zoology|volume=36|issue=|pages=1–17|doi=10.2307/2413304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To explain disjunct distributions, Croizat proposed the existence of broadly distributed ancestors that established its range during a period of mobilism, followed by a form-making process over a broad front. Disjunctions are explained as extinctions in the previously continuous range. [[Orthogenesis]] is a term used by Croizat, in his words "... in a pure mechanistic sense",&lt;ref&gt;Croizat L (1964). ''Space, Time, Form: The Biological Synthesis''. Caracas: Published by the author. p. 676.&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the fact that a variation in form is limited and constrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Colacino C|year=1997|title=Leon Croizat's biogeography and macroevolution, or ... 'out of nothing, nothing comes'|url=http://www.sciencebuff.org/ftp_only/colacino1997.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Philippine Scientist|volume=34|issue=|pages=73–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croizat considered organism evolution as a function of time, space and form. Of these three essential factors, space is the one with which biogeography is primarily concerned. However space necessarily interplays with time and form, therefore the three factors are as one of biogeographic concern. Put another way, when evolution is considered to be guided by developmental constraints or by phylogenetic constraints, it is orthogenetic.&lt;ref name="Gray1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=Russell|title=Oppositions in panbiogeography: can the conflicts between selection,  constraint, ecology, and history be resolved?|journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology|date=1989|volume=16|pages=787–806|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03014223.1989.10422935|doi=10.1080/03014223.1989.10422935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although authors belonging to the dispersalist{{clarify|date=April 2017}} establishment have dismissed Croizat's contributions, others have considered Croizat as one of the most original thinkers of modern comparative biology, whose contributions provided the foundation of a new synthesis between earth and life sciences. Panbiogeography became established as a productive research programme in historical biogeography &lt;ref name=Craw1999/&gt;

'''''Mary Wept Over the Feet of Jesus''''' is a [[graphic novel]] by Canadian cartoonist [[Chester Brown]], published in 2016.  The book is subtitled '''''Prostitution and Religious Obedience in the Bible''''', and is made up of adaptations of stories from the Bible that Brown believes promote pro-prostitution attitudes among early Christians, and argues for the decriminalization of prostitution.{{sfn|Donachie|2016}}

==Background==

{{Empty section|date=January 2018}}

==Content==

As in his previous graphic novel ''[[Paying for It]]'' (2011), Brown takes a pro-prostitution stance in ''Mary Wept Over the Feet of Jesus''.  He declares his research has determined that [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], was a prostitute, that early Christians practised prostitution, and that Jesus' [[parable of the talents or minas|Parable of the Talents]] should be read in a pro-prostitution light.  Brown describes himself as a Christian who is "not at all concerned with imposing 'moral' values or religious laws on others" and believes that Biblical figures such as [[Cain and Abel|Abel]] and [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] "find favour with God because they oppose his will or challenge him in some way".{{sfn|Lehoczky|2016}}

Brown adapts the stories or portions of stories of [[Cain and Abel]], Tamar, [[Rahab]], [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]], [[Bathsheba]], [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], the [[Parable of the talents or minas|Parable of the talents]], [[Mary of Bethany]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], and the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]].{{sfn|Brown|2016}}  Handwritten appendices make up the final third of the book, including commentary on the comics, a 55-title bibliography,{{sfn|Lehoczky|2016}} and a 20-page comics adaptation of the [[Book of Job]].{{sfn|Hatfield|2016}}

==Analysis==

{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}

Brown lays out the simple, precise artwork in a fixed grid of four panels to a page.  The dialogue is plain and direct.  The cover features a vagina-shaped frame into which Brown incorporates two smiling snakes and an open book, from which red drops fall.{{sfn|Brown|2016}}

In the book's appendices, Brown puts forth his interpretations of the stories.  He argues that prostitution had an honorable place in Biblical society, and that Matthew left clues in his narrative that Mary was a prostitute.  Brown details facts from his research that coloured his interpretations, such as that ''feet'' was used as a euphemism for "penis".  He also tells of where he used [[artistic license]] in his retellings, and of errors he made, such as depicting coins at a time when coins had not yet come into use.{{sfn|Brown|2016}}

''Material flow management is the goal oriented, efficient use of materials, material streams and energy. The goals are given by ecological and economical areas and by observing social aspects.'' (in "Protection of human beings and environment", by an Enquete Commission of the German Bundestag)

This triple jump of environmental, social and economical orientation makes MFM a tool of high importance in the field of [[Sustainable development|sustainable development (SD)]] and [[circular economy]] (CE). 
Seen historically, material flow management is a relatively new tool that can be understood as an implementation-orientated advancement of the methodology of [[Material flow analysis|material flow analysis (MFA)]]. MFM was established as a policy tool after the UN conference in [[Rio de Janeiro]] 1992. The German "Bundestag" outlined the targets and specific goals of MFM in a special report by an Enquete Commission.

'''Melioration theory''' is a theory in [[psychology]] used as an alternative to the [[matching law]]. Melioration theory is used as an explanation for why an organism makes choices based on the rewards or [[reinforcer]]s it receives. The principle of melioration states that animals will invest increasing amounts of time and/or effort into whichever alternative is better. To meliorate essentially means to "make better".&lt;ref&gt;Mazur, James E. Learning and Behavior (6th ed.) Upper Saddle River NJ: 2006 p. 332-335&lt;/ref&gt;

Melioration theory accounts for many of the choices that organisms make when presented with two variable interval schedules. Melioration is a form of matching where the subject is constantly shifting its behavior from the poorer reinforcement schedule to the richer reinforcement schedule, until it is spending most of its time at the richest variable interval schedule. By matching, the subject is equalizing the price of the reinforcer they are working for. This is also called [[hyperbolic discounting]]. In making a choice between options, living organisms need not maximize expected payoff as classical economic theory posits. Rather than being aggregated, the options compete against one another based on differences in their local reinforcement rate. The organism continuously shifts from one alternative to the other, if one is better than the other, until the other is better than the first one, regardless of the effect on overall [[rate of reinforcement]]. Melioration is capable of accounting for behavior on both concurrent ratio and concurrent interval schedules.

Melioration Equation
R1/B1 = R2/B2

If this ratio is not equal, the animal will shift its behavior to the alternative that currently has the higher response ratio. When the ratio is equal, the "cost" of each reinforcer is the same for both alternatives.

Melioration theory grew out of an impersonal anonymous interest in how the [[matching law]] comes to hold on. [[Richard Herrnstein|Richard J. Herrnstein]] (1961) reported that on concurrent VIVIVI [[reinforcement]] schedules, the proportion of responses to one alternative was approximately equal to the proportion of reinforcer received there. This finding is summarized in the matching law, which generated a great deal of both matching research and matching theorizing. Herrnstein (1970) suggested that matching may be a basic behavioral process, whereas Rachlin et al. (1976) suggested that matching comes about because it maximizes rate of matching reinforcement.

William Vaughan, Jr. (1976) suggested that the local rate of matching reinforcement on each reinforcement matching schedule is evaluated, and if those local rates differ, the distribution of time on a schedule is shifted from the poorer to the better schedule. On concurrent VIVIVI reinforcement schedules this process gives rise to matching, whereas on concurrent VRVRVR reinforcement schedules it gives rise to exclusive preferences for the better alternative and not the worse alternative. This rule was subsequently named Melioration ([[Richard Herrnstein|Herrnstein]] &amp; Vaughan, 1980). See also [[Richard Herrnstein|Herrnstein, 1982]], Vaughan, 1981; Vaughan &amp; Herrnstein, 1987)

In [[literature]], '''mood''' is the atmosphere of the narrative.  Mood is created by means of [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] (locale and surroundings in which the [[narrative]] takes place), [[Tone (literature)|attitude]] (of the narrator and of the [[Character (arts)|characters]] in the narrative), and [[description]]s.  Though atmosphere and setting are connected, they may be considered separately to a degree.  Atmosphere is the aura of mood that surrounds the story.  It is to [[fiction]] what the sensory level is to [[poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1999|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mood is established in order to affect the reader emotionally and psychologically and to provide a feeling for the narrative.

==Elements==
Mood is generally created through several different things.
Setting, which provides the physical location of the story, is used in order to create a background in which the story takes place. Different settings can affect the mood of a story differently, and usually supports or conflicts with the other content of the story in some way. For example, the desert may be a setting for a [[cowboy]] story, and may generate a mood of solitude, desolation, and struggle, among other possible associations.
The attitude of the [[narrator]] is another element that helps generate mood. As the reader is dependent on the narrator's perspective of the story, they see the story through their lenses, feeling the way the narrator feels about what happens or what is being described. Embedded in the attitude of a narrator are the feelings and emotions which make it up. A similar element that goes into generating mood is [[diction]], that is, the choice and style of words the writer uses. Diction conveys a sensibility as well as portrays the content of a story in specific colors, thus affecting the way the reader feels about it.

==Difference from tone== 
[[Tone (literature)|Tone]] and mood are not the same. The tone of a piece of literature is the speaker's or narrator's attitude towards the subject, rather than what the reader feels, as in mood. Mood is the general feeling or atmosphere that a piece of writing creates within the reader.  Mood is produced most effectively through the use of setting, theme, [[Writer's voice|voice]] and tone. Tone can indicate the narrator's mood, but the overall mood comes from the totality of the written work, even in [[first-person narrative]]s. The effect a literary work has upon the reader is subjective and produces different associations, while the text made by the author is presented to the reader as an objective thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-literature.org/essays/reader-response.php |title=The Author, the Text, and the Reader  |last=Lee Ai Ling |first=Clarissa |publisher=London School of Journalism |date=October 2002|website=English Literature |access-date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mood is suggested by the elements utilized by the author, but relies on the subjective response from the reader.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12400">'''Need for power''' ('''nPow''') is a term that was popularized by renowned psychologist [[David McClelland]] in 1961. McClelland's thinking was influenced by the pioneering work of [[Henry Murray]], who first identified underlying psychological human needs and motivational processes (1938). It was Murray who set out a [[Need theory|taxonomy of needs]], including needs for achievement, [[Power (social and political)|power]], and affiliation—and placed these in the context of an integrated motivational model. McClelland was inspired by Murray's research, and he continued to further develop Murray's theory by focusing on this theory in regard to the human population. In McClelland's book ''The Achieving Society'', A-Pow helps explain an individual's imperative to be in charge. According to his work there are two kinds of power, ''social'' and ''personal''.

==Background==

===Murray's system of needs===
Henry Murray was one of the first psychologists to systematically investigate human needs. In his 1938 book, ''Explorations in Human Personality'', he identified and labeled twenty needs he believed were universal in nature for all humans. Later research demonstrated that [[Murray's system of needs]] positively correlates with the [[Big Five personality traits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/0022-3514.55.2.258|title=From catalog to classification: Murray's needs and the five-factor model.|first1=Paul T.|last1=Costa|first2=Robert R.|last2=McCrae|publisher=|volume=55|issue=2|pages=258–265|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.55.2.258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===McClelland's three needs theory===
In the 1960s, psychologist [[David McClelland]] expanded on Murray's work, focusing on the effects of human needs in a work environment.&lt;ref&gt;NetMBA. "McClelland's Theory of Needs". 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His [[need theory]] proposes that most people are consistently motivated by one of three basic desires: the [[need for affiliation]], the [[need for achievement]], or the need for power.

===Thematic apperception test===
To determine how strongly an individual felt each of the three needs, McClelland used the [[thematic apperception test]] (TAT), which is designed to uncover a person's unconscious drives, emotions, wants and needs. During the test, a psychologist shows an individual a series of picture cards depicting ambiguous situations and asks them to tell a story about each image. The psychologist then interprets those stories to identify desires or personality traits the individual may be are unaware of or want to hide.&lt;ref&gt;Teglasi, Hedwig. "Essentials of TAT and Other Storytelling Assessments". Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Several empirical studies have demonstrated that the TAT cannot detect mental illness at a rate higher than chance,&lt;ref&gt;Wildman, R.W., &amp; Wildman, R.W. II. (1975). An investigation into the comparative validity of several diagnostic tests and test batteries. Journal of Clinical Psychology, 31, 455-458&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lilianfeld, S., Wood, J., &amp; Garb, H. [http://www.therapiebreve.be/documents/lilienfeld-ea-2000.pdf The scientific status of projective techniques.] Psychological Science in the Public Interest.&lt;/ref&gt; and the inter-rater validity as measured by [[Cronbach's alpha]] (the likelihood of two psychologists providing similar interpretations of the same person's results) is low, especially if the clinician gives a subjective interpretation instead of using the test's original scoring system.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Meyer, G. [http://psychology.utoledo.edu/images/users/16/Meyer%20(2004,%20CHoPA)%20Reliability%20and%20Validity%20of%20the%20Rorschach%20and%20TAT.pdf The reliability and validity of the Rorschach and Thematic Apperception Test compared to other psychological and medical instruments.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, N. &amp; Kreuzpointner, L. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079450 Measuring the Reliability of Picture Story Exercises like the TAT]. PLOS&lt;/ref&gt; However, proponents of the TAT argue that Cronbach's alpha is artificially low for tests with a small number of items, and that the TAT provides a more detailed and flexible description of an individual than a structured questionnaire.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Effects of a high need for power==

McClelland defines the need for power (nPow) as a desire for "power either to control other people (for &lt;nowiki&gt;[one's]&lt;/nowiki&gt; own goals) or to achieve higher goals (for the greater good)," and describes people high in this trait as seeking "neither recognition nor approval from others - only agreement and compliance."[http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/acquired_needs.htm]. In his later research, McClelland refined his theory to include two distinct types of power motivation: the need for ''socialized power'', expressed on the TAT by descriptions of plans, self-doubts, mixed outcomes, and concern for others, and the need for ''personal power'', expressed by stories in which one individual seeks power and must oppose another to get it.&lt;ref&gt;Chusmir, L. &amp; Parker, B. (1984). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00287808 Dimensions of need for power: Personalized vs. socialized power in female and male managers.] Sex Roles.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to people who value affiliation or achievement, individuals with high nPow scores tend to be more argumentative, more assertive in group discussions, and more likely to experience frustration when they feel powerless or not in control of a situation.&lt;ref&gt;Conger, Jay &amp; Kanungo, Rabindra. "The Empowerment Process: Integrating Theory and Practice" 1988&lt;/ref&gt; They are more likely to seek or hold a position in which they have control over others, and to engage in [[conspicuous consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;Larson, R. &amp; Buss, D. (2010). Personality psychology: domains of knowledge about human nature. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pros and cons===

====For individuals====
A high nPow score predicts greater career success for men and for women who report high satisfaction with the power-related aspects of their workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, SR. (1991). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8126645 Need for power and women's careers over 14 years: structural power, job satisfaction, and motive change.] Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Chusmir, L. &amp; Parker, B. (1984). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00287808 Dimensions of need for power: Personalized vs. socialized power in female and male managers.] Sex Roles, 11, 759-769.&lt;/ref&gt; McClelland's own research included case studies illustrating the advantage of high nPow in the workplace, especially for more experienced workers competing for management positions. In one characteristic example, a successful salesman with a high need for affiliation and a low need for power began to perform poorly after being promoted to management. He experienced difficulty giving direct orders, leading his subordinates to complain that he failed to set clear goals and reward individuals who performed well.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, H. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=N1A4rnVMRuAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=power+is+the+great+motivator&amp;ots=2D59mwRrz4&amp;sig=ni33Tu9fZm31DBXHd6qacUEH4pk#v=onepage&amp;q=power%20is%20the%20great%20motivator&amp;f=false Managing and Directing Your Career.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of work, a high nPow score is associated with both positive and negative outcomes, with the result often depending on whether an individual also reports a strong sense of responsibility. When combined with a low score on a measure of responsibility, a high nPow score predicts higher rates of [[Externalization|externalizing]] [[self-destructive]] behavior, such as binge-drinking and physical aggression. Men with this combination of personality traits are more likely to divorce, separate, or physically abuse their spouses. However, this association disappears for individuals with average or high responsibility scores, who are disproportionately likely to report positive outcomes like taking on social leadership roles.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Worell, J. [Ed.] [https://books.google.com/books?id=7SXhBdqejgYC&amp;pg=PA851&amp;lpg=PA851&amp;dq=need+for+power+gender+differences&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0NgJuEY-1i&amp;sig=zYNhZiDim0Q17WQAwNFeWJI2reY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DzEnVYS-DdD3oASIgIKgDg&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=need%20for%20power%20gender%20differences&amp;f=false The Encyclopedia of Women and Gender: Sex Similarities and Differences, Volume 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====For society====
As with individual outcomes, whether a high need for power results in positive or negative outcomes is influenced by the individual's other traits, particularly responsibility and empathy. An argumentative group member may prevent [[groupthink]], or they may intimidate other group members and refuse to make reasonable compromises; a hard-charging manager may motivate and focus their team, or they may bully and manipulate their subordinates. Even dangerous behaviors, like impulsive risk-taking, can be beneficial in moderation: successful stock traders &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296305000512|title=An integrated model of risk and risk-reducing strategies|first1=Jinsook|last1=Cho|first2=Jinkook|last2=Lee|date=1 January 2006|publisher=|journal=Journal of Business Research|volume=59|issue=1|pages=112–120|via=ScienceDirect|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2005.03.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entrepreneurs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1396803261/risk-taking-propensity-among-entrepreneurs-small|title=Risk Taking Propensity among Entrepreneurs, Small Business Owners and Managers|first1=Carland, James W.,|last1=III|first2=Carland, James W.,|last2=Jr.|first3=Carland, Jo Ann|last3=C.|first4=Pearce, James|last4=W.|date=1 March 1995|publisher=|volume=7|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; often have a high propensity for risk.

===Gender===

On average, men report a higher need for power than women, which may be due to biological factors, social factors, or an interaction between them. Gender also influences how the need for power is outwardly expressed: men are more likely to express anger directly, use physical violence to establish control, or engage in risky or impulsive behavior, while women are more likely to employ [[relational aggression]] or suppress their hostility.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; When the needs for socialized and personal power are measured separately, women managers express a greater desire for socialized power than their male counterparts, but an equal desire for personal power. Men, but not women, reported greater job satisfaction if they had a high need for socialized power.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Other parts of the theory==

===Need for achievement===
{{Main|Need for achievement}}
Murray defined [[need for achievement]] as the attempt to overcome obstacles. Need for achievement (nAch) was defined by McClelland as the motive to strive for success in particular situations in which his/her performance would be looked at against some type of standard. McClelland used the thematic apperception test in order to test this part of his theory. He would show people four pictures and ask people to write a story regarding these pictures. Based on his/her story, McClelland would be able to determine what type of achievement a person strived.&lt;ref name="cengagesites.com"&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://cengagesites.com/academic/assets/sites/Schultz_Ch05.pdf|title=Theories of Personality |chapter=Chapter 5 – Henry Murray: Personology|publisher=Cengage Learning|url=http://www.psychlab.net/uploads/4/5/8/3/4583362/theories_of_personality.pdf|author=Duane P. Schultz|author2=Sydney Ellen Schultz|isbn= 978-0-495-50625-6|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Need for affiliation===
{{Main|Need for affiliation}}
Murray believed [[need for affiliation]] was a trait that was very strong in most people, especially in stressful situations. Murray believed that when people were put into a stressful situation, people were more likely to feel less stress if another person was present. In McClelland's research, he found that people who had need for affiliation were often unpopular tried to avoid interpersonal conflicts because they have levels of anxiety about if others will accept them.&lt;ref name="cengagesites.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5533">{{Hinduism}}
In [[Hinduism]], and in particular [[Jnana Yoga]] and [[Advaita Vedanta]], '''''neti neti''''' (नेति नेति) is a [[Sanskrit]] expression which means "not this, not this", or "neither this, nor that" (''{{IAST|neti}}'' is [[sandhi]] from ''{{IAST|na iti}}'' "not so"). It is found in the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Avadhuta Gita]] and constitutes an analytical meditation helping a person to understand the nature of [[Brahman]] by first understanding what is not [[Brahman]]. It corresponds to the western ''[[via negativa]]'', a mystical approach that forms a part of the tradition of [[apophatic theology]]. One of the key elements of Jnana Yoga practice is often a "neti neti search." The purpose of the exercise is to negate rationalizations and other distractions from the non-conceptual meditative awareness of reality.

==Significance of neti neti==

Neti neti, meaning, "Not this, not this", is the method of Vedic analysis of negation. It is a keynote of Vedic inquiry.  With its aid the Jnani negates identification with all things of this world which is not the Atman, in this way he negates the [[Anatman (Hinduism)|Anatman]]. Through this gradual process he negates the mind and transcends all worldly experiences that are negated till nothing remains but the Self. He attains union with the Absolute by denying the body, name, form, intellect, senses and all limiting adjuncts and discovers what remains, the true "I" alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Meditation and Mantras:An Authoritative Text|author=Vishnu Devanand|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|place=New Delhi|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgnTT0eqwIoC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Neti+Neti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WrXWUM7LOo_rrQevl4CQDg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Neti%20Neti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; L.C.Beckett in his book, ''Neti Neti,'' explains that this expression is an expression of something inexpressible, it expresses the ‘suchness’ (the essence) of that which it refers to when ‘no other definition applies to it’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lotus Effect|author=Pavel G.

[[Adi Shankara]] was one of the foremost [[List of teachers of Advaita Vedanta|Advaita philosophers]] who advocated the neti-neti approach. In his commentary on [[Gaudapada]]’s Karika, he explains that [[Brahman]] is free from adjuncts and the function of ''neti neti'' is to remove the obstructions produced by ignorance. His disciple, Sureshvara, further explains that the negation, ''neti neti'', does not have negation as its purpose, it purports identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Negative Theory|author=Harold G.

By such sentences as "[[Tat Tvam Asi|That thou art]]," our own Self is affirmed. Of that which is untrue and composed of the five elements - the Sruti (scripture) says, "Not this, not this."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2732">In [[mathematics]], a '''nowhere commutative semigroup''' is a [[semigroup]] ''S'' such that, for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''S'', if ''ab'' = ''ba'' then ''a'' = ''b''.&lt;ref name=CP&gt;A H Clifford, G B Preston (1964). ''The Algebraic Theory of Semigroups Vol. I'' (Second Edition). [[American Mathematical Society]] (p.26). {{ISBN|978-0-8218-0272-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A semigroup ''S'' is nowhere commutative if and only if any two elements of ''S'' are [[inverse semigroup|inverse]]s of each other.&lt;ref name="CP"/&gt;

==Characterization of nowhere commutative semigroups==

Nowhere commutative semigroups can be [[characterization (mathematics)|characterized]] in several different ways. If ''S'' is a semigroup then the following statements are [[logical equivalence|equivalent]]:&lt;ref name=Howie&gt;{{cite book|last=J M Howie|title=An Introduction to Semigroup Theory|publisher=Academic Press|year=1976|series=LMS monographs|volume= 7|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''S'' is nowhere commutative.
*''S'' is a [[rectangular band]] (in the sense in which the term is used by Howie&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=J M Howie|title=An Introduction to Semigroup Theory|publisher=Academic Press|year=1976|series=LMS monographs|volume= 7|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
*For all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''S'',  ''aba'' = ''a''.
*For all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''S'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a'' and ''abc'' = ''ac''.

Even though, by definition, the rectangular bands are concrete semigroups, they have the defect that their definition is formulated not in terms of the basic binary operation in the semigroup. The approach via the definition of  nowhere commutative semigroups rectifies the defect.&lt;ref name=Howie/&gt;

To see that a nowhere commutative semigroup is a rectangular band, let ''S'' be a nowhere commutative semigroup. Using the defining properties of a nowhere commutative semigroup, one can see that for every ''a'' in ''S'' the intersection of the [[Green's relations|Green classes]] ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; contains the unique element ''a''. Let ''S''/''L'' be the family of ''L''-classes in ''S'' and ''S''/''R'' be the family of ''R''-classes in ''S''. The mapping
:&amp;psi; : ''S '' &amp;rarr; (''S''/''R'') &amp;times; (''S''/''L'')
defined by 
:''a''&amp;psi; = ( ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; )
is a bijection. If the Cartesian product (''S''/''R'') &amp;times; (''S''/''L'') is made into a semigroup  by furnishing it with the rectangular band multiplication, the map ψ becomes an isomorphism. So ''S'' is isomorphic to a rectangular band.

Other claims of equivalences follow directly from the relevant definitions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17351">{{about||the denaturalization of German Jews|Nuremberg Laws|the set of research ethics principles for human experimentation|Nuremberg Code}}

The '''Nuremberg principles''' were a set of guidelines for determining what constitutes a [[war crime]]. The document was created by the [[International Law Commission]] of the [[United Nations]] to [[Codification (law)|codify]] the legal principles underlying the [[Nuremberg Trials]] of [[Nazism|Nazi]] party members following [[World War II]].

== The principles ==
=== Principle I ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any person who commits an act which constitutes a [[international criminal law|crime under international law]] is responsible therefor&lt;!-- "therefor", with no final "e", is not the same word as "therefore", with a final "e".  These are two different words that mean two different things.  This one should have NO final "e". --&gt; and liable to punishment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Principle II ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact that [[internal law]] does not impose a penalty for an act which constitutes a crime under [[international law]] does not relieve the person who committed the act from responsibility under international law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Principle III ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact that a person who committed an act which constitutes a crime under international law, acted as [[Head of State]] or [[responsible government]] [[official]], does not relieve him from responsibility under international law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Principle IV ===
{{Main|Superior orders}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This principle could be paraphrased as follows: "It is not an acceptable excuse to say 'I was just following my superior's orders'".

Previous to the time of the [[Nuremberg Trials]], this excuse was known in common parlance as "[[Superior Orders]]". After the prominent, high-profile event of the Nuremberg Trials, that excuse is now referred to by many as the "[[Nuremberg Defense]]".  In recent times, a third term, "[[lawful orders]]" has become common parlance for some people. All three terms are in use today, and they all have slightly different nuances of meaning, depending on the context in which they are used.

Nuremberg Principle IV is legally supported by the [[jurisprudence]] found in [[Conscientious objector#Universal Declaration of Human Rights|certain articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which deal indirectly with conscientious objection]]. It is also supported by [[Conscientious objector#Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status|the principles found in paragraph 171 of the Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status]] which was issued by the Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR). Those principles deal with the conditions under which [[conscientious objector]]s can apply for refugee status in another country if they face persecution in their own country for refusing to participate in an illegal war.

=== Principle V ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any person charged with a crime under international law has the [[right to a fair trial]] on the facts and law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Principle VI ===

{{quote|The crimes hereinafter set out are punishable as crimes under international law:

:(a) '''[[Crimes against peace and humanity]]''':

::(i) Planning, preparation, initiation or a plan of a [[war of aggression]] or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances;

::(ii) Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the acts mentioned under (i).

:(b) '''[[War crimes]]''':

:Violations of the [[laws or customs of war]] which include, but are not limited to, [[murder]], ill-treatment or [[deportation]] to [[slave labor]] or for any other purpose of [[civilian]] [[population]] of or in [[occupied territory]]; murder or ill-treatment of [[prisoners of war]] or [[shipwreck|persons on the Seas]], killing of [[hostage]]s, [[plunder]] of [[Public property|public]] or [[private property]], wanton destruction of [[cities]], [[town]]s, or [[villages]], or devastation not justified by [[military necessity]].

:(c) '''[[Crimes against humanity]]''':

:Murder, extermination, enslavement, [[deportation]] and other inhumane acts done against any civilian population, or [[persecutions]] on political, racial, or religious grounds, when such acts are done or such persecutions are carried on in execution of or in connection with any crime against peace or any war crime.}}

=== Principle VII ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Complicity in the commission of a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity as set forth in Principle VI is a crime under international law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Principles' power or lack of power==

{{see also|Sources of international law|International legal theory}}

In the period just prior to the June 26, 1945 signing of the [[Charter of the United Nations]], the [[governments]] participating in its drafting were opposed to conferring on the [[United Nations]] [[legislative power]] to enact binding [[procedural law|rules]] of [[international law]]. As a corollary, they also rejected proposals to confer on the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] the power to impose certain general conventions on states by some form of majority vote. There was, however, strong support for conferring on the General Assembly the more limited powers of study and recommendation, which led to the adoption of Article 13 in [[Chapter IV of the United Nations Charter#Articles 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16|Chapter IV of the Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Nuremberg Principles were developed by UN organs under that limited mandate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/law/ilc/ Drafting and implementation of Article 13, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike treaty law, [[customary international law]] is not written. To prove that a certain rule is customary one has to show that it is reflected in state practice and that there exists a conviction in the [[international community]] that such practice is required as a matter of law. (For example, the [[Nuremberg Trials]] were a "practice" of the "international law" of the Nuremberg Principles; and that "practice" was supported by the international community.) In this context, "practice" relates to official state practice and therefore includes formal statements by states. A contrary practice by some states is possible. If this contrary practice is condemned by other states then the rule is confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) [http://www.icrc.org/eng/customary-law Customary international humanitarian law]&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[Sources of international law]])

In 1947, under [[UN General Assembly]] Resolution 177 (II), paragraph (a), the [[International Law Commission]] was directed to "formulate the principles of international law recognized in the Charter of the [[Nuremberg Tribunal]] and in the judgment of the Tribunal." In the course of the consideration of this subject, the question arose as to whether or not the Commission should ascertain to what extent the principles contained in the Charter and judgment constituted principles of international law. The conclusion was that since the Nuremberg Principles had been affirmed by the General Assembly, the task entrusted to the Commission was not to express any appreciation of these principles as principles of international law but merely to formulate them. The text above was adopted by the Commission at its second session. The Report of the Commission also contains commentaries on the principles (see Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1950, Vol. II, pp.&amp;nbsp;374–378).&lt;ref&gt;[[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) [[#References|References]] [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/INTRO/390?OpenDocument Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the Nüremberg Tribunal and in the Judgment of the Tribunal, 1950: Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of the principles supported and not supported==

{{for|examples relating to Principle IV (from before, during, and after the Nuremberg Trials)|Superior Orders}}

=== The 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ===

Concerning Nuremberg Principle IV, and its reference to an individual's responsibility, it could be argued that a version of the [[Superior Orders]] defense can be found as a defense to international crimes in the [[Rome Statute]] of the [[International Criminal Court]]. (The Rome Statute was agreed upon in 1998 as the foundational document of the International Criminal Court, established to try those individuals accused of serious international crimes.)  Article 33, titled "Superior Orders and prescription of law,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/romefra.htm|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; Part 3: General Principles of Criminal Law; Article 33: Superior orders and prescription of law|author= Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|date=10 November 1998 and 12 July 1999 |work= |publisher=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
states:

{{quote|1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal responsibility unless:

*(a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;
*(b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and
*(c) The order was not manifestly unlawful.}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are two interpretations of this Article:

*This formulation, especially (1)(a), whilst effectively prohibiting the use of the Nuremberg Defense in relation to charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, does however, appear to allow the Nuremberg Defense to be used as a protection against charges of war crimes, provided the relevant criteria are met.
*Nevertheless, this interpretation of ICC Article 33 is open to debate: For example, Article 33 (1)(c) protects the defendant only if "the order was not manifestly unlawful." The "order" could be considered "unlawful" if we consider [[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Nuremberg Principle IV]] to be the applicable "law"  in this case.  If so, then the defendant is not protected.  Discussion as to whether or not Nuremberg Principle IV is the applicable law in this case is found in [[Nuremberg Principles#The Principles.27 power or lack of power|a discussion of the Nuremberg Principles' power or lack of power]].

===Canada===
{{main|Jeremy Hinzman}}

Nuremberg Principle IV, and its reference to an individual's responsibility, was also at issue in [[Canada]] in the case of ''Hinzman v. Canada.'' [[Jeremy Hinzman]] was a [[U.S. Army]] [[deserter]] who claimed [[refugee]] status in Canada as a [[conscientious objector]], one of [[List of Iraq War resisters#Objectors who fled to Canada|many Iraq War resisters]]. Hinzman's lawyer, [[Jeffry House]], had previously raised the issue of the [[legality of the Iraq War]] as having a bearing on their case. The [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]] ruling was released on March 31, 2006, and denied the refugee status claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2006-05-18/news_story5.php|title=AWOL GIs Dealt Legal Blow|date=2006-05-18|author=Mernagh, M.|publisher=Toronto's Now Magazine|accessdate=2008-06-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324194828/http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2006-05-18/news_story5.php|archivedate=2007-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://reports.fja.gc.ca/eng/2006/2006fc420/2006fc420.html|title=Hinzman v.

Mactavish]] addressed the issue of personal responsibility:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An individual must be involved at the policy-making level to be culpable for a crime against peace ... the ordinary foot soldier is not expected to make his or her own personal assessment as to the legality of a conflict. Similarly, such an individual cannot be held criminally responsible for fighting in support of an illegal war, assuming that his or her personal war-time conduct is otherwise proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=153504&amp;archive=25,38,2006|title=AWOL GIs Dealt Legal Blow|date=2006-05-18|author=Mernagh, M.|publisher=Toronto's Now Magazine|accessdate=2008-06-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605061945/http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=153504&amp;archive=25%2C38%2C2006|archivedate=2011-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/en/2006/2006fc420/2006fc420.html ''Hinzman v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2010">The '''One Divides into Two''' controversy (一分为二) was an ideological debate about the nature of contradiction that took place in China in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marxistphilosophy.org/ChinTrans1221.htm|title=The "One Divides into Two" Controversy (一分为二), 1964-1980|first=Tom|last=Weston|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept originated in Lenin's ''[[Philosophical Notebooks]]''. The philosopher [[Yang Xianzhen]], originated the idea of "Two Unites into One", which he said was the primary law of [[dialectics]]. The Maoists interpreted the Aesopian meaning of this to be that capitalism could be united with [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]. [[Ai Siqi]] wrote the original attack on Yang, and was joined by Mao himself. [[Wang Ruoshui]] also contributed to the attack.  After 1976, Yang was rehabilitated as well as the concept of two uniting into one.

This phrase is derived from the formulation given by [[Vladimir Lenin]] in his ''Philosophical Notebooks''; "The splitting of a single whole and the cognition of its contradictory parts ... is the essence ... of dialectics."

[[Richard Baum]] has put the controversy in terms of modern [[game theory]] as a debate between [[zero sum]] and [[non-zero sum]] competition.

[[Alain Badiou]] during his Maoist phase would use the principle of One Divides into Two to criticize the philosophy of [[Gilles Deleuze]].

The '''Paris Principles''' were defined at the first International Workshop on National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights held in [[Paris]] on 7–9 October 1991. They were adopted by the [[United Nations Human Rights Commission]] by Resolution 1992/54 of 1992, and by the [[UN General Assembly]] in its [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|Resolution]] 48/134 of 1993. The Paris Principles relate to the status and functioning of national institutions for the protection and promotion of [[human rights]].

In addition to exchanging views on existing arrangements, the workshop participants drew up a comprehensive series of recommendations on the role, composition, status and also functions of [[national human rights institutions]] (NHRIs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/StatusOfNationalInstitutions.aspx Text of Paris Principles]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five stipulations==
The Paris Principles list a number of responsibilities for national institutions, which fall under five headings.

First, the institution shall monitor any situation of violation of human rights which it decides to take up. 
Second, the institution shall be able to advise the Government, the Parliament and any other competent body on specific violations, on issues related to legislation and general compliance and implementation with [[international human rights instruments]]. 
Third, the institution shall relate to regional and [[international organization]]s. 
Fourth, the institution shall have a mandate to educate and inform in the field of human rights. 
Fifth, some institutions are given a quasi-judicial competence.&lt;ref&gt;National Human Rights Institutions - Implementing Human Rights", Danish Institute for Human Rights, 2003. {{ISBN|87-90744-72-1}}, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

"The key elements of the composition of a national institution are its independence and pluralism. In relation to the independence the only guidance in the Paris Principles is that the appointment of commissioners or other kinds of key personnel shall be given effect by an official Act, establishing the specific duration of the mandate, which may be renewable." &lt;ref&gt;National Human Rights Institutions - Implementing Human Rights", Danish Institute for Human Rights, 2003. {{ISBN|87-90744-72-1}}, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Compliance with the Paris Principles is the central requirement of the accreditation process that regulates NHRI access to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] and other bodies. This is a [[peer review]] system operated by a subcommittee of the [[Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions|Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI).]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1126">"'''Recept'''" (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|iː|ˌ|s|ɛ|p|t}}) is a term used in the work of 19th-century [[Psychology|psychologist]] [[George Romanes]] to refer to an idea that is formed by the repetition of [[percept]]s (i.e., successive percepts of the same object).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Webster's New International Dictionary |year=1913 |publisher=G. &amp; C. Merriam |location=Springfield, Massachusetts |page=1781}} "A mental image or idea formed by successive percepts of the same or like objects, and thus accentuating their common characters; a generic image."&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is similar to that of concatenated impressions, as seen in the work of [[David Hume]]. 

The term is used in [[Richard Maurice Bucke]]'s book, ''Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind''. Bucke was a 19th-century  [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15240">The concept of '''relation''' as a term used in general philosophy has a long and complicated history. One of the interests for the Greek philosophers lay in the number of ways in which a particular thing might be described, and the establishment of a relation between one thing and another was one of these. A second interest lay in the difference between these relations and the things themselves. This was to culminate in the view that the things in themselves could not be known except through their relations. Debates similar to these continue into modern philosophy and include further investigations into types of relation and whether relations exist only in the mind or the real world or both.

An understanding of types of relation is important to an understanding of relations between many things including those between people, communities and the wider world. Most of these are complex relations but of the simpler, analytical relations out of which they are formed there are generally held to be three types, although opinion on the number may differ. The three types are spatial relations which include geometry and number, relations of cause and effect, and the classificatory relations of similarity and difference that underlie knowledge. Going by different names in the sciences,&lt;ref&gt;Perreault J. ''Categories and Relators'' (''International Classification'', vol 21, No 4, Frankfurt 1994) pp.189ff where Perreault talks of ordinal relations (e.g. dimensions), determinative relations (e.g. activities) and subsumptive relations (e.g. types and kinds)&lt;/ref&gt; mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;Piaget J. ''Structuralism'' (tr. Maschler C., Routledge and Kegan Paul, London 1971) pp 24-25 where [[Jean Piaget]] refers to the mathematicians, [[Nicolas Bourbaki]], using topological structures (derived from geometrical relations), order structures (from predecessor-successor relations) and algebraic structures (including sets and sub-sets)&lt;/ref&gt; and the arts &lt;ref&gt;Norberg-Schulz C., ''Intentions in Architecture'' (Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd., London 1963) Besides such headings as Form (geometrical and spatial relations), Building Task (functional relations) and Semantics (relations of meaning) the book refers to [[Charles W. Morris]]'s division of semiology into syntactics (formal relation of signs), pragmatics (use and effect of signs) and semantics (the relation between the sign and reality)&lt;/ref&gt;  they can be thought of as three large families and it is the history of these that will be dealt with here.

==Ancient Greeks==
Traditionally the history of the concept of relation begins with [[Aristotle]] and his concept of relative terms. In ''Metaphysics'' he states: "Things are called relative as the double to the half... as that which can act to that which can be acted upon... and as the knowable to knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' 1020b; cf De Generatione 333a&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the content of these three types can be traced back to the [[Parmenides (dialogue)|Eleatic Dilemmas]], a series of puzzles through which the world can be explained in totally opposite ways, for example things can be both one and many, both moving and stationary and both like and unlike one another.&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Parmenides'' 129, cf 136&lt;/ref&gt;

For Aristotle relation was one of ten distinct kinds of [[Categories (Aristotle)|predicate]] (Gk. ''kategorien'') which list the range of things that can be said about any particular subject: "...each signifies either substance or quantity or  quality or relation or where or when or being-in-a-position or having or acting or being acted upon".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Categories'' in ''Aristotle's Categories and De Interpretatione'' (tr. Ackrill J.L., Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1963) Ch.4&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects and predicates were combined together to form simple propositions. These were later redefined as "categorical" propositions in order to distinguish them from two other types of proposition, the disjunctive and the hypothetical, identified a little later by [[Chrysippus]].&lt;ref&gt;Long A. &amp; Sedley D. ''The Hellenistic Philosophers'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1987) p.206&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative strand of thought at the time was that relation was more than just one of ten equal categories. A fundamental opposition was developing between substance and relation.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' 998b ff; cf 1029a &amp; 1070a; ''Physics'' 185a; ''Analytica Posteriora'' 83b&lt;/ref&gt; Plato in ''Theaetetus'' had noted that "some say all things are said to be relative" &lt;ref&gt;Long &amp; Sedley, ''op.cit''. p.480&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Speusippus]], his nephew and successor at the Academy maintained the view that "... a thing cannot be known apart from the knowledge of other things, for to know what a thing is, we must know how it differs from other things".&lt;ref&gt;Ex Brit cv ''Speusippus''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plotinus]] in third century Alexandria reduced Aristotle's categories to five: substance, relation, quantity, motion and quality.&lt;ref name="enneads"&gt;Plotinus ''Enneads''&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|VI.3.3, VI.3.21}} He gave further emphasis to the distinction between substance and relation and stated that there were grounds for the latter three: quantity, motion and quality to be considered as relations. Moreover, these latter three categories were posterior to the Eleatic categories, namely unity/plurality; motion/stability and identity/difference concepts that Plotinus called "the hearth of reality".&lt;ref name="enneads"/&gt;{{rp|V.1.4}}

Plotinus liked to picture relations as lines linking elements, but in a process of abstraction our minds tend to ignore the lines "and think only of their terminals".&lt;ref name="enneads"/&gt;{{rp|VI.5.5}} His pupil and biographer, [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], developed a tree analogy picturing the relations of knowledge as a tree branching from the highest genera down through intermediate species to the individuals themselves.&lt;ref name="enneads"/&gt;{{rp|V.3.10, V.6.1}}

==Scholasticism to the Enlightenment==
The opposition between substance and relation was given a theological perspective in the Christian era. [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil]] in the Eastern church suggested that an understanding of the [[Trinity]] lay more in understanding the types of relation existing between the three members of the Godhead than in the nature of the Persons themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas ''Summa Theologiae'' (Blackfriars, 1967) p.30 (note); cf St.Augustine ''The Trinity'' (Catholic University of America Press, 1963) p.180&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the Western church noted that in God "relations are real",&lt;ref name="gilby"&gt;Gilby T. ''St. Thomas Aquinas: Theological Texts'' (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52}} and, echoing Aristotle, claimed that there were indeed three type of relation which give a natural order to the world. These were quantity, as in double and half; activity, as in acting and being acted upon; and understanding, through the qualitative concepts of genus and species.&lt;ref name="gilby"/&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2017}} "Some have said that relation is not a reality but only an idea. But this is plainly seen to be false from the very fact that things themselves have a mutual natural order and relation... There are three conditions that make a relation to be real or logical ..." &lt;ref&gt;Pegis A.C. ''Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas'' (Random House, 1948) S.T. Q13.A7&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the Scholastic period marked the beginning of a decline in the pre-eminence of the classificatory relation as a way of explaining the world. Science was now in the ascendant and with it scientific reason and the relation of cause and effect. In Britain, [[John Locke]], influenced by Isaac Newton and the laws of motion, developed a similar mechanistic view of the human mind. Following [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]'s notion of "trains of thought"&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes T. ''Leviathan'' (Blackwell, Oxford, 1946) p.13&lt;/ref&gt; where one idea naturally follows another in the mind, Locke developed further the concept of knowledge as the perception of relations between ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Locke J. ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (J.F.Dove, London, 1828) pp. 367-372; 4.1.2-4.1.7&lt;/ref&gt; These relations included mathematical relations, scientific relations such as co-existence and succession, and the relations of identity and difference.

It was left to the Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] to reduce these kinds of [[Association of Ideas|mental association]] to three: "To me there appears to be only three principles of connexion among ideas namely Resemblance, Contiguity in time or place, and Cause or Effect".&lt;ref&gt;Hume D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'' (Cohen R. (ed.) Bantam, London, 1965) p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem which troubled Hume of being able to establish the reality of relations from experience, in particular the relation of cause and effect, was solved in another way by [[Immanuel Kant]] who took the view that our knowledge is only partly derived from the external world. Part of our knowledge he argued must be due to the modifying nature of our own minds which imposes on perception not only the forms of space and time but also the categories of relation which he understood to be ''a priori'' concepts contained within the understanding. Of these he famously said: "Everything in our knowledge... contains nothing but mere relations".&lt;ref name="kant"&gt;Kant I. ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (tr. Smith N.K., Macmillan, London, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}}

Kant took a more analytical view of the concept of relation and his categories of relation were three namely, community, causality and inherence.&lt;ref name="kant"/&gt;{{rp|113}} These can be compared with Hume's three kinds of association in that, firstly, community depicts elements conjoined in time and space, secondly causality compares directly with cause and effect, and thirdly inherence implies the relation of a quality to its subject and plays an essential part in any consideration of the concept of resemblance. Preceding the table of categories in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' is the table of judgements and here, under the heading of relation, are the three types of [[syllogism]] namely the [[Disjunctive syllogism|disjunctive]], the [[Hypothetical syllogism|hypothetical]] and the [[Categorical proposition|categorical]],&lt;ref name="kant"/&gt;{{rp|107, 113}} developed as we have seen through Aristotle, Chryssipus and the logicians of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]] and [[William of Sherwood]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] raised objections to the term Community and the term disjunction, as a relation, can be usefully substituted for the more complex concept of community.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer A. ''The World as Will and Representation'' (tr. Payne E., Dover Publications, New York, 1966) p.459&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F.Hegel]] also referred to three types of proposition but in Hegel the categories of relation which for Kant were "subjective mental processes" have now become "objective ontological entities".&lt;ref&gt;Stace W.T. ''The Philosophy of Hegel'' (Macmillan &amp; Co., London, 1924) p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern developments in philosophy==
[[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]] in America recorded that his own categories of relation grew originally out of a study of Kant. He introduced three metaphysical categories which pervaded his philosophy, and these were ordered through a consideration of the development of our mental processes:

* Firstness. "The first is predominant in feeling... the whole content of consciousness is made up of qualities of feeling as truly as the whole of space is made up of points or the whole of time by instants".&lt;ref name="peirce"&gt;Peirce C.S. ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'' (Hartshorne C. &amp; Weiss P. (eds.) Harvard University Press, 1931) Vol I&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|149–159}}  Consciousness in a sense arises through the gradual disjunction of what was once whole. Elements appear to be monadic in character and are represented as points in space and time.
* Secondness. The idea of secondness "is predominant in the ideas of causation" coming into being as "an action and reaction" between ourselves and some other, or between ourselves and a stimulus.&lt;ref name="peirce"/&gt;{{rp|159–163}}  It is essentially dyadic in character and in some versions of symbolic logic is represented by an arrow.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein ''op.cit''. pp.23 &amp; 61&lt;/ref&gt;
* Thirdness. "Ideas in which thirdness predominates include the idea of a [[Semiotics|sign]] or representation... For example, a picture signifies by similarity".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce ''op.cit''. pp. 170-176&lt;/ref&gt; This type of relation is essentially triadic in nature and is represented in Peirce's logic as a brace or bracket.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce ''op.cit.'' Vol II, p.159; cf Wittgenstein ''op.cit.'' p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

These categories of relation appeared in Peirce's logic of relatives and followed earlier work undertaken by the mathematician [[Augustus De Morgan]] at Cambridge who had introduced the notion of relation into formal logic in 1849. Among the philosophers who followed may be mentioned [[Thomas Hill Green|T.H Green]] in England who took the view that all reality lies in relations and [[William James]] in America who, emphasising the concept of relation, pictured the world as a "concatenated unity" with some parts joined and other parts disjoined.&lt;ref&gt;Passmore J. ''A Hundred Years of Philosophy'', 1957 (Penguin, 1968) pp.58,108, ; cf Peirce ''op.cit''. Vol II, p.267&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]], in 1921, reinforced James's view that "... the raw material out of which the world is built up, is not of two sorts, one matter and one mind but that it is designed in different patterns by its interrelations, and that some arrangements may be called mental, while others may be called physical".&lt;ref&gt;Russell B. ''Analysis of Mind'' (George Allen &amp; Unwin, London 1921) pp.10 &amp; 23&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], also in 1921, saw the same kinds of relation structuring both the material world and the mental world. While the real world consisted of objects and their relations which combined together to form facts, the mental world consisted of similar subjects and predicates which pictured or described the real world.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein L. ''Tractatus Logico Philosophicus'', 1921 (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London, 1961) p.37&lt;/ref&gt; For Wittgenstein there were three kinds of description (enumeration, function and law) which themselves bear a notable if distant "family resemblance" to the three kinds of relation whose history we have been following.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein L. ''Philosophical Investigations'', 1953 (tr. Anscombe G., Blackwell, Oxford, 1978) p.32 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Also of note at the beginning of the twentieth century were arguments associated with [[George Edward Moore|G.E.Moore]] among others concerning the concept of internal and external relations whereby relations could be seen as either contingent or accidental parts of the definition of a thing.&lt;ref&gt;Passmore ''op.cit''. p.207&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''road diet''', also called a '''lane reduction''' or '''road rechannelization''', is a technique in [[transportation planning]] whereby the number of travel lanes and/or effective width of the road is reduced in order to achieve systemic improvements.

==Techniques==
A typical road diet technique is to reduce the number of lanes on a roadway cross-section. One of the most common applications of a road diet is to improve safety or provide space for other modes of travel.  For example, a two-way, four lane road might be reduced to one travel lane in each direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://carfreeamerica.net/road-diet-guide/|title=Road Diet Guide - Car Free America|work=Car Free America|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freed-up space is then used to provide or enhance some of the following features:

*Adding or widening of footpaths/[[sidewalk]]s
*Adding or widening of boulevards (landscaping strips)
*Adding [[cycle lane]]s on one or both sides of the road
*Adding [[reserved track|reserved tramtracks]], usually in the middle of the road
*Widening remaining traffic lanes (if previously unsafely narrow to allow four lanes)
*Adding a [[Center left-turn lane#Turn lanes|center turn lane]] / flush traffic median for turning traffic
*Adding a [[reversible lane|reversible center lane]]
*Conversion of the rightmost or leftmost travel lane to a breakdown lane (The [[Lodge Freeway]] in [[metro Detroit]] is an example of this after [[Interstate 96|I-96]], the Jeffries Freeway, was built.)

If properly designed, traffic does not divert to other streets after a road diet, because the road previously provided excessive capacity. In other scenarios, reduction of traffic (either local traffic or overall traffic) is intended in the scheme. Road diets are usually successful on roads carrying fewer than 19,000 vehicles per day. Road diets can succeed at volumes up to about 23,000 vehicles per day. However, more extensive reconstruction is needed. Examples include replacing signals with [[roundabout]]s, [[traffic calming]] on parallel streets to discourage traffic from diverting away from the main road, and other means to keep traffic moving smoothly and uniformly.

===Lane diets===
In a lane diet, the width of a lane is decreased to reduce vehicle speeds and yield space for other use.  Typically [[vehicular]] travel lane widths are narrowed to no more than ten feet, and left turn (in countries where drivers use the right-hand side of the road) storage lanes to nine or ten feet. Resulting space can be applied to pedestrian refuges, medians, sidewalks, shoulders, parking, or bike lanes. Lane width guidelines in the United States are offered as a range and lane diets fall within this range.

In many cases of four-lane roadways with double-yellow, this can present a hazard for oncoming traffic in the "passing lane", as well as left-turners.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Sometimes four-lane with double-yellow is upgraded to five-lane with center turn lane since that practice is more of an upgrade than a "diet" like three-lane with center turn lane is.

==Benefits==
Proponents of road diets generally believe key benefits include lower vehicular speeds, reduced crash rates, and improved [[pedestrian|pedestrian safety]]. Other benefits of road diets include promoting better land use, reducing [[induced traffic]], promoting greater driving attentiveness, and promoting [[cycling]] through the addition of bicycle lanes. Providing dedicated left turn (in countries that drive on the right-hand side of the road) lanes at intersections can improve vehicular safety and can enable efficiency gains along the roadway.

Researchers have found that road diets can be expected to reduce overall crash frequency by 19% to 43%, with the higher crash reductions occurring in small urban areas than in metropolitan areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Evaluation of Lane Reduction 'Road Diet' Measures on Crashes |author= Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center |date= June 2010 |url= http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/10053/index.cfm |publisher= [[Federal Highway Administration]] |id= FHWA-HRT-10-053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A leading proponent of road diets is former Florida Bicycle and Pedestrian Coordinator Dan Burden, who now helms the Walkable and Livable Communities Institute. Burden and Peter Lagerwey published an article on the topic in 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Burden |first1= Dan |first2= Peter |last2= Lagerwey |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Road Diets: Fixing the Big Roads |publisher= Walkable Communities |date= March 1999 |url= http://www.walkable.org/download/rdiets.pdf |format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that in two cases, 95% of residents were initially opposed to roadway constriction. Additional studies have shown that road diets often achieve these positive effects without reducing traffic volumes.

Among studies now showing that there are safety improvements to driving when lane widths are reduced include a recent report by the [[NCHRP|National Cooperative Highway Research Program]] (NCHRP) and work analyzing traffic safety for 14 years in all 50 states by Robert B. Noland.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Criticisms==
Critics of road diets generally believe they can negatively affect the speed and reliability of transit service operating on the roadway, particularly if [[bus stop]]s are located in pullouts and traffic queues delay buses attempting to re-enter traffic. Constructing [[bus bulb]]s can mitigate these effects though this feature results in delays for other vehicles.

Not all multi-lane arterials are good candidates for road constriction. Added congestion can outweigh benefits if vehicle traffic volumes exceed the capacity of the three-lane roadway. This threshold is approximately 20,000 vehicles per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Evaluation of Lane Reduction 'Road Diet' Measures and Their Effects on Crashes and Injuries |author= Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center |date= March 2004 |url= http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/humanfac/04082/index.cfm |publisher= Federal Highway Administration |id= FHWA-HRT-04-082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burden notes additional characteristics of better candidates for vehicle lane removal.

Other concerns regard public safety; police, fire and ambulances may be slowed and if an evacuation is ordered, the evacuation will be slower.

==Paradise==
The 2018 "Camp" fire, in which the town of Paradise CA completely burned, is thought to have been made more catastrophic due to the implementation of a road diet. The city's decision to install a Vision Zero-Type Road Diet along its primary traffic artery may have contributed to loss of life as traffic backed up and gridlocked. Some were reduced to fleeing on foot. Others were unable to outrun the flames and lost their lives.

Fires happen in Butte county. In 2008, ten years prior to the one that totally destroyed the town, a massive fire prompted evacuations of the communities of Paradise and Magalia. The evacuation was plagued with gridlock. In shades of the fatal future fire, many residents were trapped in their cars with flames racing along both sides of the road. With cars hopelessly blocked, these people fled on foot, barely escaping with their lives.

The final report &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=  Butte County Grand Jury Report 2008/2009 Wildfire &amp; Safety Considerations For Butte County General Plan 2030 |author= Butte County Grand Jury |date= 2008-2009 |url= https://www.buttecounty.net/Portals/1/GrandJury/08-09/Grand_Jury_Report_FY08-09-Sec10.pdf|publisher= Butte County Court}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Butte County Grand Jury investigation of the 2008 incident noted there are only four roads of escape for 40,000 people in Paradise, Magalia, and Upper Ridge. Three of those routes are narrow, two lane mountain roads. The grand jury noted that these roads have “significant constraints limiting their use as evacuation routes during a major event, especially another event of multiple fires.”

The only area road capable of handing more than a small capacity was Skyway Boulevard, a state highway connecting the mountain towns with the city of Chico. The grand jury recommended, “immediate modification of Skyway, from Paradise to Chico, as an emergency evacuation route, by removing trees and brush and creating fire barriers on both sides of the road.”

Instead, in 2012 the county decided to narrow Skyway in Paradise, in a Vision Zero-Type Road Diet, removing lanes and instead installing bike lanes, bulb-outs and other traffic calming measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=  The Deadly Consequences of Road Diets|author= Christopher D.

In mathematics, a '''sheaf of planes''' is the set of all [[plane (geometry)|planes]] that have the same common [[line (geometry)|line]].&lt;ref name="def"&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SheafofPlanes.html Definition on ''Mathworld Wolfram'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sommerville|first1=D.

When extending the concept of line to the [[line at infinity]], a set of '''parallel planes''' can be seen as a ''sheaf of planes'' intersecting in a ''line at infinity''. To distinguish it from the more common definition the adjective ''parallel'' can be added to it, resulting in the expression: ''parallel sheaf of planes''.&lt;ref name="para"&gt;[http://www.vitutor.com/geometry/space/sheaf_planes.html Vitutor: Sheaf of Planes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work focuses on appreciative dialogic transformation within a variety of social and institutional contexts including psychotherapy, organizations, education, healthcare, and local communities. She engages constructionist practices in a variety of contexts to bring communities of participants with diametrically opposing viewpoints together to create livable futures.

McNamee is married to a scholar of communication (Professor John Lannamann).  They reside in [[Durham, New Hampshire]].

== Work ==

=== Founding Member ===
McNamee is a founder, board member and vice president of the Taos Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taos Institute|url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taos Institute is a nonprofit educational organization dedicated to the development of social constructionist theory and practices for purposes of world benefit. With over two hundred Associates around the world, the Taos Institute achieves their educational ends through conferences, workshops, publications, a Ph.D. program, distance learning programs, newsletters, learning networks, and web-based offerings. The Taos Institute also engages in [[collaborative partnership]]s with other national and international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taos Mission Statement|url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/Websites/taos/images/AboutAbout/taos_mission_statement.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Constructionist theory and practice locates the source of meaning, value, and action in relational process.  Through our shared constructions of the real, the rational and the good, communities are formed and ways of life secured.  New ways of life can also be envisioned and created through relational processes. And when communities conflict, it is also through such process that peace may best be restored.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taos Mission Statement|url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/Websites/taos/images/AboutAbout/taos_mission_statement.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awards ===
Awards received by McNamee include Class of 1944 Professorship at the University of New Hampshire (2001-2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unh.edu/news/news_releases/2001/september/em_20010907mcnamee.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Lindberg Award for Outstanding Scholar/Teacher in the College of Liberal Arts at the University of New Hampshire (2007–2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lindberg Award|url=http://www.unh.edu/liberal-arts/faculty/lindberg_2007.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, Sheila was added to the Fulbright Specialists Roster (2012-2017) and received a Fulbright Specialist Grant to work with faculty and students at the University of Caldas in Manizales, Colombia (May–June, 2012), exploring social constructionist theory and practice in social work, family development, social sciences, social research, conflict resolution, and mediation.
&lt;br /&gt;
:''"Rather than approach conflict and problem solving with the goal of minimizing differences among perspectives and working toward consensus, we must develop processes for creating a system of co-existence and collaboration that entails incommensurate but respected positions of difference. If you understand how communication creates a way of seeing the world, you can understand how those different views are internally coherent; starting from this position, we invite ourselves and others to become curious about our differences (first) rather than judgmental."'' said McNamee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universidad de Caldas Press Release|url=http://www.ucaldas.edu.co/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7270:-sheila-mcnamee-comparte-su-experiencia-en-comunicacion-en-u-de-caldas&amp;catid=419:universidad-al-dia&amp;Itemid=1039|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Author ===

Sheila McNamee is the author of several books on social construction.

Sheila co-authored ''Relational Responsibility: Resources for Sustainable Dialogue'' (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Relational Responsibility: Resources for Sustainable Dialogue|year=1999|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=0-7619-1094-8|author=Sheila McNamee|author2=Kenneth J. Gergen }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Kenneth Gergen. In ''Relational Responsibility'', Sheila and Ken question the tradition of individual responsibility and transform the concept of responsibility by giving centre stage to the relational process rather than to the individual - replacing alienation and isolation with meaningful dialogue.

McNamee co-authored ''Research and Social Change: A Relational Constructionist Approach''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Research and Social Change: A Relational Constructionist Approach|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-80671-8|author=McNamee, S.|author2=Hosking, D.M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2012) with Dian Marie Hosking. In this book, Sheila and Dian Marie bridge scholarly forms of inquiry and practitioners’ daily activities. They introduce inquiry as a process of relational construction, offering resources to practitioners who want to reflect on how their work generates practical effects. Sheila and Diane Marie lay out relational constructionist premises and explore these in terms of their generative possibilities both for inquiry and social change work.

{{emotion}}
'''Shyness''' (also called '''diffidence''') is the [[feeling]] of [[fear|apprehension]], [[discomfort|lack of comfort]], or [[awkwardness]] especially when a person is around other people. This commonly occurs in new situations or with unfamiliar people. Shyness can be a characteristic of people who have low [[self-esteem]]. Stronger forms of shyness are usually referred to as [[social anxiety]] or [[social phobia]].
The primary defining characteristic of shyness is a largely ego-driven fear of what other people will think of a person's behavior. This results in a person becoming scared of doing or saying what they want to out of fear of negative reactions, being laughed at, humiliated or patronised, criticism or rejection. A shy person may simply opt to avoid social situations instead.&lt;ref name="RCP"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Royal College of Psychiatrists | year = 2012 | title = Shyness and social phobia | url = http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mentalhealthinfo/problems/anxietyphobias/shynessandsocialphobia.aspx |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important aspect of shyness is social skills development. Schools and parents may implicitly ''assume'' children are fully capable of effective social interaction. Social skills training is not given any priority (unlike reading and writing) and as a result, shy students are not given an opportunity to develop their ability to participate in class and interact with peers. Teachers can model social skills and ask questions in a less direct and intimidating manner in order to gently encourage shy students to speak up in class, and make friends with other children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/02568540809594634| title = The Stresses of a "Brave New World": Shyness and School Adjustment in Kindergarten| journal = Journal of Research in Childhood Education| volume = 22| issue = 4| pages = 377–389| year = 2008| last1 = Coplan | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Arbeau | first2 = K. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The initial cause of shyness varies. Scientists believe that they have located genetic data supporting the [[hypothesis]] that shyness is, at least, partially genetic. However, there is also evidence that suggests the environment in which a person is raised can also be responsible for their shyness. This includes [[child abuse]], particularly [[emotional abuse]] such as ridicule. Shyness can originate after a person has experienced a physical [[anxiety]] reaction; at other times, shyness seems to develop first and then later causes physical symptoms of anxiety. Shyness differs from [[social anxiety]], which is a broader, often [[clinical depression|depression]]-related psychological condition including the experience of [[fear]], apprehension or worrying about being evaluated by others in social situations to the extent of inducing [[panic]].

Shyness may come from genetic traits, the environment in which a person is raised and personal experiences. Shyness may be a personality trait or can occur at certain stages of development in children.

=== Genetics and heredity ===

Shyness is often seen as a hindrance to people and their development. The cause of shyness is often disputed but it is found that [[fear]] is positively related to shyness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15250000902839971 | title = Development of Shyness: Relations with Children's Fearfulness, Sex, and Maternal Behavior | year = 2009 | last1 = Eggum | first1 = Natalie | last2 = Eisenberg | first2 = Nancy | last3 = Spinrad | first3 = Tracy | last4 = Reiser | first4 = Mark | last5 = Gaertner | first5 = Bridget | last6 = Sallquist | first6 = Julie | last7 = Smith | first7 = Cynthia | journal = Infancy | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 325–345 | pmid = 20011459 | pmc = 2791465}}&lt;/ref&gt;  suggesting that fearful children are much more likely to develop being shy as opposed to children less fearful. Shyness can also be seen on a biological level as a result of an excess of [[cortisol]]. When cortisol is present in greater quantities it is known to suppress an individual's immune system, making them more susceptible to illness and disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/h0087100 | title = Shyness and symptoms of illness in young children | year = 2000 | last1 = Chung | first1 = Joanna Y.Y. | last2 = Evans | first2 = Mary Ann | journal = Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science | volume = 32 | pages = 49–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genetics of shyness is a relatively small area of research that has been receiving an even smaller amount of attention, although papers on the biological bases of shyness date back to 1988. Some research has indicated that shyness and [[aggression]] are related—through long and short forms of the [[gene]] [[Dopamine receptor D4|DRD4]], though considerably more research on this is needed.  Further, it has been suggested that shyness and [[social anxiety|social phobia]] (the distinction between the two is becoming ever more blurred) are related to [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]. As with other studies of [[behavioral genetics]], the study of shyness is complicated by the number of genes involved in, and the confusion in defining, the [[phenotype]].  Naming the phenotype – and translation of terms between genetics and [[psychology]] — also causes problems.

Several genetic links to shyness are current areas of research.  One is the [[serotonin]] transporter promoter region polymorphism ([[5-HTTLPR]]), the long form of which has been shown to be modestly correlated with shyness in grade school children.&lt;ref name="ArbelleS2003Relation"&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Shoshana |last1=Arbelle |first2=Jonathan |last2=Benjamin |first3=Moshe |last3=Golin |first4=Ilana |last4=Kremer |first5=Robert H. |last5=Belmaker |first6=Richard P. |last6=Ebstein |title=Relation of shyness in grade school children to the genotype for the long form of the serotonin transporter promoter region polymorphism |journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=160 |issue=4 |pages=671–676 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12668354 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.4.671}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous studies had shown a connection between this form of the gene and both obsessive-compulsive disorder and [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17151167 | year = 2006 | last1 = Brune | first1 = CW | last2 = Kim | first2 = SJ | last3 = Salt | first3 = J | last4 = Leventhal | first4 = BL | last5 = Lord | first5 = C | last6 = Cook Jr | first6 = EH | title = 5-HTTLPR Genotype-Specific Phenotype in Children and Adolescents with Autism | volume = 163 | issue = 12 | pages = 2148–56 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.2006.163.12.2148 | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Model organism#Vertebrates|Mouse model]]s have also been used, to derive genes suitable for further study in humans; one such gene, the [[L-glutamic acid decarboxylase|glutamic acid decarboxylase]] gene (which encodes an [[enzyme]] that functions in [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA synthesis]]), has so far been shown to have some association with behavioral inhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smoller |first1=Jordan W. |last2=Rosenbaum |first2=Jerold F. |last3=Biederman |first3=Joseph |last4=Susswein |first4=Lisa S. |last5=Kennedy |first5=John |last6=Kagan |first6=Jerome |last7=Snidman |first7=Nancy |last8=Laird |first8=Nan |last9=Tsuang |first9=Ming T. |last10=Faraone |first10=Stephen V. |last11=Schwarz |first11=Alysandra |last12=Slaugenhaupt |first12=Susan A. |title=Genetic association analysis of behavioral inhibition using candidate loci from mouse models |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics |year=2001 |volume=105 |pages=226–235 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1328 |pmid=11353440 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another gene, the dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) exon III polymorphism, had been the subject of studies in both shyness and aggression and is currently the subject of studies on the "novelty seeking" trait. A 1996 study of anxiety-related traits (shyness being one of these) remarked that, "Although twin studies have indicated that individual variation in measures of anxiety-related personality traits is 40-60% heritable, none of the relevant genes has yet been identified", and that "10 to 15 genes might be predicted to be involved" in the anxiety trait. Progress has been made since then, especially in identifying other potential genes involved in personality traits, but there has been little progress made towards confirming these relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lesch |first1=Klaus-Peter |last2=Bengal |first2=Dietmar |last3=Heils |first3=Armin |last4=Sabol |first4=Sue Z. |last5=Greenberg |first5=Benjamin D. |last6=Petri |first6=Susanne |last7=Benjamin |first7=Jonathan |last8=Muller |first8=Clemens R. |last9=Hamer |first9=Dean H. |last10=Murphy |first10=Dennis L. |title=Association of anxiety-related traits with a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene regulatory region |journal=Science |year=1996 |volume=274 |issue=5292 |pages=1527–1531 |bibcode=1996Sci...274.1527L |doi=10.1126/science.274.5292.1527 |pmid=8929413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long version of the 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) is now postulated to be correlated with shyness,&lt;ref name="ArbelleS2003Relation"/&gt; but in the 1996 study, the short version was shown to be related to anxiety-based traits.

=== As a symptom of mercury poisoning ===

Excessive shyness, embarrassment, self-consciousness and timidity, social-phobia and lack of self-confidence are also components of [[erethism]], which is a symptom complex that appears in cases of [[mercury poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;WHO (1976) Environmental Health Criteria 1: Mercury, Geneva, [[World Health Organization]], 131 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WHO. Inorganic mercury. Environmental Health Criteria 118. World Health Organization, Geneva, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mercury poisoning was common among hat makers in England in the 18th and 19th centuries, who used mercury to stabilize wool into felt fabric.

=== Prenatal development ===

The prevalence of shyness in some children can be linked to day length during [[pregnancy]], particularly during the midpoint of prenatal development.&lt;ref name=daylength&gt;Gortmaker, SL. et al. ''Daylength during pregnancy and shyness in children: results from northern and southern hemispheres''. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of longitudinal data from children living at specific latitudes in the [[United States]] and [[New Zealand]] revealed a significant relationship between hours of day length during the midpoint of pregnancy and the prevalence of shyness in children. "The odds of being classified as shy were 1.52 times greater for children exposed to shorter compared to longer daylengths during gestation."&lt;ref name=daylength /&gt; In their analysis, scientists assigned conception dates to the children relative to their known birth dates, which allowed them to obtain random samples from children who had a mid-gestation point during the longest hours of the year and the shortest hours of the year (June and December, depending on whether the cohorts were in the United States or New Zealand).

The longitudinal survey data included measurements of shyness on a five-point scale based on interviews with the families being surveyed, and children in the top 25th percentile of shyness scores were identified. The data revealed a significant co-variance between the children who presented as being consistently shy over a two-year period, and shorter day length during their mid-prenatal development period. "Taken together, these estimates indicate that about one out of five cases of extreme shyness in children can be associated with gestation during months of limited daylength."&lt;ref name=daylength /&gt;

=== Low birth weights ===

In recent years correlations between birth weight and shyness have been studied. Findings suggest that those born at low birth weights are more likely to be shy, risk-aversive and cautious compared to those born at normal birth weights. These results do not however imply a cause-and-effect relationship.&lt;ref name=Us.health&gt;{{cite news|last=U.S|first=News Staff|title=Do Underweight Newborns Make for Shy Adult|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/articles/2008/07/09/do-underweight-newborns-make-for-shy-adults|accessdate=14 March 2013|date=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personality trait ==

Shyness is most likely to occur during unfamiliar situations, though in severe cases it may hinder an individual in their most familiar situations and relationships as well. Shy people avoid the objects of their apprehension in order to keep from feeling uncomfortable and inept; thus, the situations remain unfamiliar and the shyness perpetuates itself.  Shyness may fade with time; e.g., a [[child]] who is shy towards strangers may eventually lose this trait when [[maturity (psychology)|older]] and become more socially adept. This often occurs by adolescence or young adulthood (generally around the age of 13). In some cases, though, it may become an integrated, lifelong [[character trait]]. Longitudinal data suggests that the three different personality types evident in infancy easy, slow-to-warm-up, and difficult tend to change as children mature. Extreme traits become less pronounced, and personalities evolve in predictable patterns over time. What has been proven to remain constant is the tendency to internalize or externalize problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janson | first1 = H. | last2 = Matheisen | first2 = K.S. | year = 2008 | title = Temperament profiles from infancy to middle childhood: Developmentand associations with behavior problems | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 5| pages = 1314–1328 | doi=10.1037/a0012713 | pmid=18793065}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relates to individuals with shy personalities because they tend to internalize their problems, or dwell on their problems internally instead of expressing their concerns, which leads to disorders like depression and anxiety.&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coplan | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Rose-Krasnor | first2 = L. | last3 = Weeks | first3 = M. | last4 = Kingsbury | first4 = A. | last5 = Kingsbury | first5 = M. | last6 = Bullock | first6 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Alone is a crowd: Social motivations, social withdrawal, and socioemotional functioning in later childhood | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 49| issue = 5| pages =  861–875| doi = 10.1037/a0028861 | pmid=22686178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans experience shyness to different degrees and in different areas.

Shyness can also be seen as an academic [[determinant]]. It has been determined that there is a negative relationship between shyness and classroom performance. As the shyness of an individual increased, classroom performance was seen to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chisti | first1 = Saeed-ul-Hasan | last2 = Anwar | first2 = Saeed | last3 = Babar Khan | first3 = Shahinshah | year = 2011 | title = Relationship between shyness and classroom performance at graduation level in Pakistan | url = | journal = Interdisciplinary Journal of Contemporary Research in Business | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 532–538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shyness may involve the discomfort of difficulty in knowing what to say in [[social support|social]] situations, or may include crippling physical manifestations of uneasiness. Shyness usually involves a combination of both symptoms, and may be quite devastating for the sufferer, in many cases leading them to feel that they are boring, or exhibit bizarre behavior in an attempt to create interest, alienating them further. Behavioral traits in social situations such as [[smiling]], easily producing suitable [[conversation]]al topics, assuming a relaxed [[Human position|posture]] and making good [[eye contact]], may not be second nature for a shy person. Such people might only affect such traits by great difficulty, or they may even be impossible to display.

Those who are shy are perceived more negatively, in cultures that value sociability, because of the way they act towards others.&lt;ref name="P"/&gt;  Shy individuals are often distant during conversations, which can result in others forming poor impressions of them. People who are not shy may be up-front, aggressive, or critical towards shy people in an attempt "to get them out of their shell."  This can actually make a shy person feel worse, as it draws attention to them, making them more self-conscious and uncomfortable.

== Concepts ==

=== Versus introversion ===

The term shyness may be implemented as a lay blanket-term for a family of related and partially overlapping afflictions, including [[timidity]] (apprehension in meeting new people), bashfulness and diffidence (reluctance in asserting oneself), apprehension and anticipation (general fear of potential interaction), or intimidation (relating to the object of fear rather than one's low confidence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/shy |title=Shy &amp;#124; Define Shy at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparent shyness, as perceived by others, may simply be the manifestation of reservation or [[introversion]], character traits which cause an individual to voluntarily avoid excessive social contact or be terse in communication, but are not motivated or accompanied by discomfort, apprehension, or lack of confidence.

Rather, according to professor of psychology Bernardo J. Carducci, introverts ''choose'' to avoid social situations because they derive no reward from them or may find surplus sensory input overwhelming, whereas shy people may fear such situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitten |first=Meredith |url=http://psychcentral.com/library/shyness.htm |title=All About Shyness |publisher=Psych Central |date=2001-08-21 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research using the statistical techniques of factor analysis and correlation have found shyness overlaps mildly with both introversion and neuroticism (i.e., negative emotionality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8260.1979.tb00314.x| title = Shyness as a dimension of personality| journal = British Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology| volume = 18| pages = 121–128| year = 1979| last1 = Crazier | first1 = W.

Both shyness and introversion can outwardly manifest with socially withdrawn behaviors, such as tendencies to avoid social situations, especially when they are unfamiliar. A variety of research suggests that shyness and introversion possess clearly distinct motivational forces and lead to uniquely different personal and peer reactions and therefore cannot be described as theoretically the same,&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="As"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Asendorpf | first1 = J.B. | last2 = Meier | first2 = G.H. | year = 1993 | title = Personality effects on children's speech in everyday life: Sociability-mediated exposure and shyness-mediated reactivity to social situations | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 6| pages = 1072–1083 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.6.1072}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHEN"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = X. | last2 = Wang | first2 = L. | last3 = Cao | first3 = R. | year = 2011 | title = Shyness-sensitivity and unsociability in rural Chinese children: Relations with social, school, and psychological adjustment | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 82 | issue = 5| pages = 1531–1543 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01616.x | pmid=21790539}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Susan Cain]]'s ''[[Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking|Quiet]]'' (2012) further discerning introversion as involving being ''differently'' social (preferring one-on-one or small group interactions) rather than being ''anti''-social altogether.&lt;ref name="NPR20120130"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/01/30/145930229/quiet-please-unleashing-the-power-of-introverts |title=Quiet, Please: Unleashing 'The Power Of Introverts' |last=Cornish |first=Audie (interviewer) |date=30 January 2012 |publisher=NPR |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65trRHEMP?url=http://www.npr.org/2012/01/30/145930229/quiet-please-unleashing-the-power-of-introverts |archivedate=4 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that no unique physiological response, such as an increased heart beat, accompanies socially withdrawn behavior in familiar compared with unfamiliar social situations. But unsociability leads to decreased exposure to unfamiliar social situations and shyness causes a lack of response in such situations, suggesting that shyness and unsociability affect two different aspects of sociability and are distinct personality traits.&lt;ref name="As"/&gt; In addition, different cultures perceive unsociability and shyness in different ways, leading to either positive or negative individual feelings of self-esteem. Collectivist cultures view shyness as a more positive trait related to compliance with group ideals and self-control, while perceiving chosen isolation (introverted behavior) negatively as a threat to group harmony; and because collectivist society accepts shyness and rejects unsociability, shy individuals develop higher self-esteem than introverted individuals.&lt;ref name="CHEN"/&gt; On the other hand, individualistic cultures perceive shyness as a weakness and a character flaw, while unsociable personality traits (preference to spend time alone) are accepted because they uphold the value of autonomy; accordingly, shy individuals tend to develop low self-esteem in Western cultures while unsociable individuals develop high self-esteem.&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt;

=== Versus social phobia ===

An extreme case of shyness is identified as a psychiatric illness, which made its debut as [[social phobia]] in [[DSM-III]] in 1980, but was then described as rare.&lt;ref name=Lane2007&gt;{{cite book |last=Lane |first=Christopher |year=2008 |title=Shyness: How Normal Behavior Became a Sickness |publisher=Yale University Press |place=New Haven |isbn=9780300124460}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}} By 1994, however, when [[DSM-IV]] was published, it was given a second, alternative name in parentheses ([[social anxiety disorder]]) and was now said to be relatively common, affecting between 3 and 13% of the population at some point during their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Anxiety disorders. In Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed., text rev., pp. 450–456). Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ralphstone&gt;R.E. Stone. ''Is the American Psychiatric Association in Bed with Big Pharma?'' 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies examining shy adolescents and university students found that between 12 and 18% of shy individuals meet criteria for [[social anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Shyness affects people mildly in unfamiliar social situations where one feels anxiety about interacting with new people. Social anxiety disorder, on the other hand, is a strong irrational fear of interacting with people, or being in situations which may involve public scrutiny,  because one feels overly concerned about being criticized if one embarrasses oneself. Physical symptoms of social phobia can include blushing, shortness of breath, trembling, increased heart rate, and sweating; in some cases, these symptoms are intense enough and numerous enough to constitute a [[panic attack]]. Shyness, on the other hand, may incorporate many of these symptoms, but at a lower intensity, infrequently, and does not interfere tremendously with normal living.&lt;ref name="RCP"/&gt;

=== Social versus behavioral inhibition ===

Those considered shy are also said to be ''socially inhibited''. [[Social inhibition]] is the conscious or unconscious constraint by a person of behavior of a social nature. In other words, social inhibition is holding back for social reasons. There are different levels of social inhibition, from mild to severe. Being socially inhibited is good when preventing one from harming another and bad when causing one to refrain from participating in class discussions.

''Behavioral inhibition'' is a temperament or personality style that predisposes a person to become fearful, distressed and withdrawn in novel situations. This personality style is associated with the development of [[anxiety disorders]] in adulthood, particularly [[social anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref name="behavioral inh."&gt;{{cite web|title=Behavioral Inhibition as a childhood predictor of social anxiety, part 1|url=http://akfsa.org/research/behavioral-inhibition-as-a-childhood-predictor-of-social-anxiety-part-1/|website=Andrew Kukes foundation for social anxiety|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ordoñez-Ortega | first1 = A. | last2 = Espinosa-Fernandez | first2 = L. | last3 = Garcia-Lopez | first3 = LJ | last4 = Muela-Martinez | first4 = JA | year = 2013 | title = Behavioral Inhibition and Relationship with Childhood Anxiety Disorders/Inhibición Conductual y su Relación con los Trastornos de Ansiedad Infantil | url = | journal = Terapia Psicologica | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 355–362 | doi=10.4067/s0718-48082013000300010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Misconceptions and negative aspects ==

Many misconceptions/stereotypes about shy individuals exist in western culture and negative peer reactions to "shy" behavior abound. This takes place because individualistic cultures place less value on quietness and meekness in social situations, and more often reward outgoing behaviors. Some misconceptions include viewing introversion and social phobia synonymous with shyness, and believing that shy people are less intelligent.&lt;ref name="P"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Paulhus |first1=D.L. |last2=Morgan |first2=K.L. |year=1997 |title=Perceptions of intelligence in leaderless groups: The dynamic effects of shyness and acquaintance |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=581–591 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.3.581 |pmid=9120785|citeseerx=10.1.1.586.2278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HC"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=K. |last2=Coplan |first2=R.J. |year=2010 |title=Exploring processes linking shyness and academic achievement in childhood |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=213–222 |doi=10.1037/a0022070 |journal=School Psychology Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Coplan |first1=J.R. |last2=Hughes |first2=K. |last3=Bosacki |first3=S. |last4=Rose-Krasnor |first4=L. |year=2011 |title=Is silence golden?

=== Intelligence ===

No correlation (positive or negative) exists between intelligence and shyness.&lt;ref name="CH"/&gt; Research indicates that shy children have a harder time expressing their knowledge in social situations (which most modern curricula utilize) and because they do not engage actively in discussions, teachers view them as less intelligent. In line with [[social learning theory]], an unwillingness to engage with classmates and teachers makes it more difficult for shy students to learn. Test scores, however, indicate that shyness is unrelated to actual academic knowledge, and therefore only academic engagement.&lt;ref name="HC"/&gt; Depending on the level of a teacher's own shyness, more indirect (vs. socially oriented) strategies are used with shy individuals to assess knowledge in the classroom, and accommodations are made.&lt;ref name="CH"/&gt; Observed peer evaluations of shy people during initial meeting and social interactions thereafter found that peers evaluate shy individuals as less intelligent during the first encounter. During subsequent interactions, however, peers perceived shy individuals' intelligence more positively.&lt;ref name="P"/&gt;

== Benefits ==

Thomas Benton claims that because shy people "have a tendency toward self-criticism, they are often high achievers, and not just in solitary activities like research and writing. Perhaps even more than the drive toward independent achievement, shy people long to make connections to others often through altruistic behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chronicle.com/article/ShynessAcademe/44632/ | title=Shyness and Academe | publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education | date=24 May 2004 | accessdate=20 October 2013 | author=Thomas H. Benton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Cain describes the benefits that shy people bring to society that US cultural norms devalue. Without characteristics that shy people bring to social interactions, such as sensitivity to the emotions of others, contemplation of ideas, and valuable listening skills, there would be no balance to society.&lt;ref name="NYTimesCain20110625"/&gt; In earlier generations, such as the 1950s, society perceived shyness as a more socially attractive trait, especially in women, indicating that views on shyness vary by culture.&lt;ref name="NYTimesCain20110625"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/opinion/sunday/26shyness.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Shyness: Evolutionary Tactic? |last=Cain |first=Susan |authorlink=Susan Cain |date=25 June 2011 |website=The New York Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Iuzdd5ca?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/opinion/sunday/26shyness.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |archivedate=16 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist Susie Scott challenged the interpretation and treatment of shyness as being pathological. "By treating shyness as an individual pathology, ... we forget that this is also a ''socially oriented'' state of mind that is ''socially'' produced and managed."&lt;ref name=Scott2007&gt;{{cite book |first=Susie |last=Scott |title=Shyness and Society: the illusion of competence |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |place=Basingstoke |year=2007 |isbn=9781403996039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} She explores the idea that "shyness is a form of deviance: a problem for society as much as for the individual", and concludes that, to some extent, "we are all impostors, faking our way through social life".&lt;ref name=Scott2007/&gt;{{rp|165,174}} One of her interview subjects (self-defined as shy) puts this point of view even more strongly: "Sometimes I want to take my cue from the militant [[Inclusion (disability rights)|disabled lobbyists]] and say, 'hey, it's not MY problem, it's society's'. I want to be proud to be shy: on the whole, shys are probably more sensitive, and nicer people, than 'normals'. I shouldn't have to change: society should adapt to meet my needs."&lt;ref name=Scott2007/&gt;{{rp|164}}

== Different cultural views ==

In cultures that value outspokenness and overt confidence, shyness can be perceived as weakness.&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt; To an unsympathetic observer, a shy individual may be mistaken as cold, distant, arrogant or aloof, which can be frustrating for the shy individual.&lt;ref name="P"/&gt; However, in other cultures, shy people may be perceived as being thoughtful, intelligent, as being good listeners, and as being more likely to think before they speak.&lt;ref name=NYTimesCain20110625/&gt;

In cultures that value autonomy, shyness is often analyzed in the context of being a social dysfunction, and is frequently contemplated as a personality disorder or mental health issue. Some researchers are beginning to study comparisons between [[individualistic]] and [[collectivistic]] cultures, to examine the role that shyness might play in matters of social etiquette and achieving group-oriented goals. "Shyness is one of the emotions that may serve as behavioral regulators of social relationships in collectivistic cultures. For example, social shyness is evaluated more positively in a collectivistic society, but negatively evaluated in an individualistic society."&lt;ref name=frijda&gt;Frijda, N.H., &amp; [[Batja Mesquita|Mesquita, B.]] ''Social roles and functions: A interaction functions of emotion.'' 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a cross-cultural study of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Canadians|Canadian]] school children, researchers sought to measure several variables related to social reputation and peer relationships, including "shyness-sensitivity." Using peer nomination questionnaire, students evaluated their fellow students using positive and negative playmate nominations. "Shyness-sensitivity was significantly and negatively correlated with measures of peer acceptance in the Canadian sample. Inconsistent with Western results, it was found that items describing shyness-sensitivity were separated from items assessing isolation in the factor structure for the Chinese sample. Shyness-sensitivity was positively associated with sociability-leadership and with peer acceptance in the Chinese sample."&lt;ref name=chinesecanadian&gt;Chen, X., Rubin, K., Sun, Y. ''Social Reputation and Peer Relationships in Chinese and Canadian Children: A Cross-Cultural Study''. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western perceptions ===

In some Western cultures shyness-inhibition plays an important role in psychological and social adjustment. It has been found that shyness-inhibition is associated with a variety of maladaptive behaviors. Being shy or inhibited in Western cultures can result in rejection by peers, isolation and being viewed as socially incompetent by adults. However, research suggests that if social withdrawal is seen as a personal choice rather than the result of shyness, there are fewer negative connotations.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FDu7Y9tTbpYC&amp;dq=The+Development+of+Shyness+and+Social+Withdrawal |title=The Development of Shyness and Social Withdrawal |year=2010 |publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-60623-522-5|pages=213–227|editor=Kenneth H. Rubin and Robert J. Coplan |chapter=10 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British writer [[A. C. Benson|Arthur C. Benson]] felt shyness is not mere self-consciousness, but a primitive suspicion of strangers, the primeval belief that their motives are predatory, with shyness a sinister quality which needs to be uprooted.&lt;ref&gt;p. 162, Benson, Arthur C. 1908. ''Arthur C. Benson At Large Number XI Shyness.'' Putnam’s Monthly and The Reader, A Magazine of Literature, Art and Life. Volume IV. New Rochelle, New York: G.P. Putnam’s Sons, The Knickerbocker Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed the remedy is for the shy to frequent society for courage from familiarity. Also, he claimed that too many shy adults take refuge in a critical attitude, engaging in brutal onslaughts on inoffensive persons. He felt that a better way is for the shy to be nice, to wonder what others need and like, interest in what others do or are talking about, friendly questions, and sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 162-165, Benson, Arthur C. 1908. ''Arthur C. Benson At Large Number XI Shyness.'' Putnam’s Monthly and The Reader, A Magazine of Literature, Art and Life. Volume IV. New Rochelle, New York: G.P. Putnam’s Sons, The Knickerbocker Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Is this author's opinion, written in 1908, really notable enough to be mentioned in this article? --&gt;&lt;!-- at least a warning to the reader would be nice! --&gt;

For Charles Darwin shyness was an ‘odd state of mind’  appearing to offer no benefit to our species, and since the 1970s the modern tendency in psychology has been to see shyness as pathology.&lt;ref name=Aeon20130717&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aeonmagazine.com/being-human/shyness-cannot-be-cured-it-is-part-of-being-human/ |title=The crystalline wall |last=Moran |first=Joe |date=17 July 2013 |website=[[Aeon (digital magazine)|Aeon]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IuyiDBo5?url=http://www.aeonmagazine.com/being-human/shyness-cannot-be-cured-it-is-part-of-being-human/ |archivedate=16 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, evolutionary survival advantages of careful temperaments over adventurous temperaments in dangerous environments have also been recognized.&lt;ref name="NYTimesCain20110625"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aeon20130717/&gt;

=== Eastern perceptions  ===

In Eastern cultures shyness-inhibition in school-aged children is seen as positive and those that exhibit these traits are viewed well by peers and are accepted. They tended to be seen as competent by their teachers, to perform well in school and to show well-being. Shy individuals are also more likely to attain leadership status in school. Being shy or inhibited does not correlate with loneliness or depression as those in the West do. In Eastern cultures being shy and inhibited is a sign of politeness, respectfulness, and thoughtfulness.&lt;ref name=book /&gt;

=== Examples of shyness and inhibition ===

In Hispanic cultures shyness and inhibition with authority figures is common. For instance, Hispanic students may feel shy towards being praised by teachers in front of others, because in these cultures students are rewarded in private with a touch, a smile, or spoken word of praise. Hispanic students may seem shy when they are not. It is considered rude to excel over peers and siblings; therefore it is common for Hispanic students to be reserved in classroom settings. Adults also show reluctance to share personal matters about themselves to authority figures such as nurses and doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the students' culture effects their behavior|url=http://literacynet.org/lp/hperspectives/culteffect.html|publisher=Teaching from a Hispanic perspective a handbook for non-Hispanic adult educators|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures in which the community is closed and based on agriculture (Kenya, India, etc.) experience lower social engagement than those in more open communities (United States, Okinawa, etc.) where interactions with peers is encouraged. Children in Mayan, Indian, Mexican, and Kenyan cultures are less expressive in social styles during interactions and they spend little time engaged in socio-dramatic activities. They are also less assertive in social situations. Self-expression and assertiveness in social interactions are related to shyness and inhibition in that when one is shy or inhibited one exhibits little or no expressive tendencies.&lt;ref name=book /&gt; Assertiveness is demonstrated in the same way, being shy and inhibited lessen one's chances of being assertive because of a lack of confidence.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In the Italian culture emotional expressiveness during interpersonal interaction is encouraged. From a young age children engage in debates or discussions that encourage and strengthen social assertiveness. Independence and social competence during childhood is also promoted. Being inhibited is looked down upon and those who show this characteristic are viewed negatively by their parents and peers. Like other cultures where shyness and inhibition is viewed negatively, peers of shy and inhibited Italian children reject the socially fearful, cautious and withdrawn. These withdrawn and socially fearful children express loneliness and believe themselves to be lacking the social skills needed in social interactions.&lt;ref name=Rubin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Kenneth|author2=Sheryl A.

== Intervention and treatment ==

Psychological methods and pharmaceutical drugs are commonly used to treat shyness in individuals who feel crippled because of low self-esteem and psychological symptoms, such as depression or loneliness.  According to research, early intervention methods that expose shy children to social interactions involving team work, especially team sports, decrease their anxiety in social interactions and increase their all around self-confidence later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Findlay | first1 = L.C. | last2 = Coplan | first2 = R.J. | year = 2008 | title = Come out and play: Shyness in childhood and the benefits of organized sports participation | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 153–161 | doi=10.1037/0008-400x.40.3.153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementing such tactics could prove to be an important step in combating the psychological effects of shyness that make living normal life difficult for anxious individuals.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

{{Redirect|New species|newly evolved species|speciation}}
A '''species description''' is a formal description of a newly discovered [[species]], usually in the form of a [[scientific paper]].  Its purpose is to give a clear description of a new species of [[organism]] and explain how it differs from species which have been described previously or are related. The species description often contains photographs or other illustrations of the [[type (biology)|type material]] and states in which museums it has been deposited. The publication in which the species is described gives the new species a formal [[scientific name]]. Some 1.9 million species have been identified and described, out of some 8.7 million that may actually exist.&lt;ref name=plos&gt;{{cite journal | author= Mora, C.| title=How Many Species Are There on Earth and in the Ocean?|journal=[[PLoS Biology]]|date=August 23, 2011|url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127 |pmid=21886479 |pmc=3160336 |volume=9 |pages=e1001127|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millions more have become [[extinction|extinct]].

== Naming process ==
A name of a new species becomes [[Validly published name|valid]] ([[Available name|available]] in zoological terminology) with the date of publication of its formal scientific description. Once the scientist has performed the necessary research to determine that the discovered organism represents a new species, the scientific results are summarized in a scientific manuscript, either as part of a book, or as a paper to be submitted to a scientific journal.

A scientific species description must fulfill several formal criteria specified by the [[nomenclature codes]], e.g. selection of at least one [[Type (biology)|type specimen]]. These criteria are intended to ensure that the species name is clear and unambiguous, for example, the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) states that "Authors should exercise reasonable care and consideration in forming new names to ensure that they are chosen with their subsequent users in mind and that, as far as possible, they are appropriate, compact, euphonious, memorable, and do not cause offence."&lt;ref name="ICZNRec25C"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=June 18, 2011|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/|title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Recommendation 25C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species names are written in the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, but many species names are based on words from other languages, Latinized.

Once the manuscript has been accepted for publication,&lt;ref name="ICZNexampleabstract"&gt;One example of an abstract of an article naming a new species can be found at {{cite journal|last1=Wellner|first1=S.|last2=Lodders|first2=N.|last3=Kampfer|first3=P.|title=Methylobacterium cerastii sp. nov., isolated from the leaf surface of Cerastium holosteoides|journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology|date=13 June 2011|volume=62|issue=Pt 4|pages=917–924|doi=10.1099/ijs.0.030767-0|url=http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/early/2011/06/10/ijs.0.030767-0.abstract?sid=90908f15-6b51-4878-8663-92387c779b71|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415195732/http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/early/2011/06/10/ijs.0.030767-0.abstract?sid=90908f15-6b51-4878-8663-92387c779b71|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 April 2013|accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the new species name is officially created.

Once a species name has been assigned and approved, it can generally not be changed except in the case of error.  For example, a species of beetle (''[[Anophthalmus hitleri]]'') was named by a German collector after [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1933 when he had recently become chancellor of Germany.&lt;ref name="hitler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rosegeorge.com/site/a-beetle-called-hitler|title=A beetle called Hitler|date=13 April 2002|work=Rose George}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not clear whether such a dedication would be considered acceptable or appropriate today, but the name remains in use.&lt;ref name="hitler" /&gt;

Species names have been chosen on many different bases. Most common is a naming for the species' external appearance, its origin, or the species name is a dedication for a certain person.  Examples would include a bat species named for the two stripes on its back (''[[Saccopteryx bilineata]]''), a frog named for its Bolivian origin (''[[Phyllomedusa boliviana]]''), and an ant species dedicated to the actor Harrison Ford (''[[Pheidole harrisonfordi]]''). A scientific name in honor of a person or persons is a known as a taxonomic '''patronym''' or patronymic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Capinera|editor1-first=John L.|title=Encyclopedia of Entomology|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=1402062427|page=2765|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&amp;pg=PA2765&amp;dq=patronymic+scientific+name&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gbPyU5rDH4G2iwKYxoGQBA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=patronym&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Strahan|editor1-first=Ronald|editor2-last=Conder|editor2-first=Pamela|title=Dictionary of Australian and New Guinean Mammals|date=2007|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmJsAzEXRyEC&amp;pg=PT15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of humorous species names also exist.  Literary examples include the genus name ''[[Borogovia]]'' (an extinct dinosaur), which is named after the borogove, a mythical character from Lewis Carrol's poem "[[Jabberwocky]]".  A second example, ''[[Macrocarpaea apparata]]'' (a tall plant) was named after the magical spell "to apparate" from the Harry Potter novels by J. K. Rowling, as it seemed to appear out of nowhere.&lt;ref name="funnyspeciesnames"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=June 18, 2011|url=http://www.curioustaxonomy.net/index.html|title=Curiosities of Biological Nomenclature}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the British naturalist [[Peter Scott]] proposed the binomial name ''[[Nessiteras rhombopteryx]]'' ("Ness monster with diamond-shaped fin") for the Loch Ness Monster; it was soon spotted that it was an anagram of "Monster hoax by Sir Peter S".

=== Species names recognizing benefactors ===
{{see also|List of organisms named after famous people}}
Species have frequently been named by scientists in recognition of supporters and benefactors.  For example, the genus ''[[Victoria (plant)|Victoria]]'' (a flowering waterplant) was named in honour of Queen Victoria of Great Britain.  More recently, a species of lemur (''[[Avahi cleesei]]'') was named after the actor [[John Cleese]] in recognition of his work to publicize the plight of lemurs in Madagascar.

Non-profit ecological organizations may also allow benefactors to name new species in exchange for financial support for taxonomic research and nature conservation. A German non-profit organisation (gemeinnütziger Verein), [[BIOPAT - Patrons for Biodiversity]] has raised more than $450,000 for research and conservation through sponsorship of over 100 species using this model.&lt;ref name="fundingecologicalresearch"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=June 18, 2011|url=http://www.unep.org/dec/onlinemanual/Enforcement/InstitutionalFrameworks/EconomicInstruments/Resource/tabid/1014/Default.aspx|title=Financing conservation efforts by selling naming rights of new species}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual example of this system is the ''[[Callicebus aureipalatii]]'' (or "monkey of the Golden Palace"), which was named after the [[GoldenPalace.com|Golden Palace casino]] in recognition of a $650,000 contribution to the [[Madidi National Park]] in Bolivia in 2005.

The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) discourages this practice somewhat: "Recommendation 20A. Authors forming generic names should comply with the following ... (h) Not dedicate genera to persons quite unconcerned with botany, mycology, phycology, or natural science in general."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2012|ref=ICN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of species descriptions ==
[[File:Linné-Systema Naturae 1735.jpg|thumb|right|Original title page of [[Linnaeus]]'s ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', published in 1735.]]
Early biologists often published entire volumes or multiple-volume works of descriptions in an attempt to catalog all known species. These catalogs typically featured extensive descriptions of each species and were often illustrated upon reprinting.

The first of these large catalogs was [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[History of Animals]]'', published around 343 B.C. Aristotle included descriptions of creatures, mostly fish and invertebrates, in his homeland, and several [[mythological creature]]s rumored to live in far-away lands, such as the [[manticore]].

In 77 A.D. [[Pliny the Elder]] dedicated several volumes of his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' to the description of all life forms he knew to exist.  He appears to have read Aristotle's work, since he writes about many of the same far-away mythological creatures.

Toward the end of the 12th century, ''[[Konungs skuggsjá]]'', an [[Old Norse]] [[philosophical]] [[didactic]] work, featured several descriptions of the whales, seals, and monsters of the Icelandic seas. These descriptions were brief and often erroneous, and a description of the [[mermaid]] and a rare island-like sea monster called [[Hafgufa|Hafgufu]] was included. The author was hesitant to mention the beast (known today to be fictitious) for fear of its size, but felt it was important enough to be included in his descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Konungs skuggsjá|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC05178869&amp;id=LgtIfLwQgX4C&amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;q=hafgfua&amp;f=false|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the earliest recognized species authority is [[Linnaeus]], who standardized the modern [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] system beginning with his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' in 1735.&lt;ref name = "linnaeus"&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus, C.]]|title = [[Systema Naturae]]|year = 1735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the catalog of known species was increasing rapidly, it became impractical to maintain a single work documenting every species.  Publishing a paper documenting a single species was much faster and could be done by scientists with less broadened scopes of study.  For example, a scientist who discovered a new species of insect would not need to understand plants, or frogs, or even insects which did not resemble the species, but would only need to understand closely related insects.

== Modern species descriptions ==
Formal species descriptions today follow strict guidelines set forth by the [[codes of nomenclature]]. Very detailed formal descriptions are made by scientists, who usually study the organism closely for a considerable time. A '''diagnosis''' may be used instead of,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2012|loc=Article 38|ref=ICN}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as well as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |date=1999 |title= International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Fourth Edition, adopted by the International Union of Biological Sciences  |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?article=13&amp;nfv=true}} article 13&lt;/ref&gt; the description. A diagnosis specifies the distinction between the new species and other species.

== Rates of species description ==
According to the RetroSOS report,&lt;ref name="retroSOS2012"&gt;{{Cite report |author=Quentin Wheeler |authorlink= |author2=Sara Pennak |date=January 18, 2012 |title=Retro SOS 2000-2009: A Decade of Species Discovery in Review |url=http://www.esf.edu/species/SOS.htm |publisher=International Institute for Species Exploration, Arizona State University |page= |docket= |accessdate=April 25, 2013 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the following numbers of species have been described each year since 2000.

The '''Swarm Development Group''' ('''SDG''') is an American non-profit organization to advance the development of [[complex adaptive system]]-oriented [[agent-based model]]ing (ABM) tools initiated at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] (SFI) in Santa Fe, New Mexico, US. It was formed in 1999 by a group of multidisciplinary scientists, researchers, and software developers, led by [[Chris Langton]]. Langton was also the founder of the emerging field of research called [[artificial life]].  The initial, primary, role for the SDG was to house continued development of the [[Swarm (simulation)|Swarm]] simulation software after the software become independent of the SFI in 1999.

The role of the Swarm Development Group, has since expanded to include the co-ordination of a long-running conference SwarmFest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarm.org/wiki/Swarm:_SwarmFest SwarmFest]&lt;/ref&gt; during May, June, or July each summer – typically hosted by a different research university each year. Developers, users, and researchers gather to present research papers and discuss the state of Swarm and other agent-based modeling platforms like [[Repast (modeling toolkit)|RePast]] (University of Chicago) and Ascape&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/es/dynamics/models/ascape/ Ascape]&lt;/ref&gt; (Brookings).  Typically, a wide range of academic, corporate, and government organizations are represented at SwarmFest.   The first SwarmFest was in 1998 while Swarm was still sponsored by the Santa Fe Institute.   From SwarmFest 2000 onwards, after the SDG was formed in late 1999, SwarmFests were organized directly by the SDG.

Recent SwarmFests have been held at a variety of institutions.  SwarmFest 2007 was held at DePaul University's School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.depaul.edu/news/default.asp School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; in downtown Chicago, Illinois.  SwarmFest 2008 was held at Northwestern Memorial Hospital/Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, in downtown Chicago, Illinois.  Swarmfest 2008 had special focus areas on [[agent based modeling]] in [[Systems Biology]], and the implementation of [[agent based model]]s in [[high-performance computing]] environments. Between 2009 and 2012, SwarmFest was held at the Santa Fe Complex in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].  Swarmfest 2013 was held at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida July 8–9.;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ucf.edu/swarmfest2013.html SwarmFest2013]&lt;/ref&gt; SwarmFest 2014 was held at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, IN from June 29 – July 1, 2014;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swarmfest2014.org/ |title=SwarmFest2014 |accessdate=2014-05-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509001230/http://www.swarmfest2014.org/ |archivedate=May 9, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC (in 2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swarmfest2015.org/ |title=SwarmFest2015 |accessdate=2018-02-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117084740/http://www.swarmfest2015.org/ |archivedate=January 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of Vermont in Burlington, VT (in 2016),&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/swarmfest2016/ SwarmFest2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and Old Dominion University in Suffolk, VA (in 2017),&lt;ref&gt;[http://swarmfest2017.org/ SwarmFest2017]&lt;/ref&gt; were the selected venues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1539">The term '''taskscape''' is often credited to [[social anthropology|social anthropologist]] [[Tim Ingold]]. As Ingold has described the term: "just as the [[landscape]] is an array of related features, so – by analogy – the taskscape is an array of related activities." Taskscape, then is a socially constructed space of human activity, understood as having spatial boundaries and delimitations for the purposes of analysis. Of key importance, is that ''taskscape'' as well as ''landscape'', is to be considered as perpetually in process rather than in a static or otherwise immutable state. A taskscape is typically analyzed via five factors: mobility, habitat, economy, nature, and public space.

Tim Ingold coined the term in his 1993 article&lt;ref&gt;Ingold, Tim. (1993) "The Temporality of the Landscape", ''World Archaeology'', 25(2): pp. 152-174&lt;/ref&gt; defining the spatial and temporal dimensions of the landscape in human life. He considers it as a methodological structure and analyses the temporality of the landscape in [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel's]] famous painting, ''[[The Harvesters (painting)|The Harvesters]]''.

'''Thomas Titus Nkobi''' (born 22 October 1922 in Southern [[Matabeleland]], died 25 September 1994 in [[Johannesburg]] / South Africa) was a senior leader of the South African [[African National Congress|African National Congress (ANC)]] and a key figure in the [[apartheid|Anti-Apartheid]] movement. Until his death he was the Treasurer General of the ANC and also its Member of Parliament.

==Life==
Thomas Titus Nkobi ("Comrade T.G.") was born on 22 October 1922 in [[Plumtree, Zimbabwe|Plumtree]], [[Matabeleland South]], [[Southern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]). He grew up and was educated in South Africa, where his father was working in the mines as a migrant labourer. He was at [[Adams College]] of Education in [[KwaZulu Natal]] with [[Joshua Nkomo]], the Zimbabwean Vice-President and [[Bernard Chidzero]], the Zimbabwean Minister of Finance and Dr. [[Ntsu Mokhehle]], the Prime Minister of [[Lesotho]]. After completing High School in Natal he matriculated from Bantu High School (later Madibane High School) in Western Township, Johannesburg in 1946 and went to [[National University of Lesotho|Roma College (now National University of Lesotho)]] in Lesotho, pursuing a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] degree.

His initial political involvement against the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|Apartheid regime]] started in 1944 during the [[Alexandra, Gauteng|Alexandra]] bus boycott, a non-violent protest campaign. In 1950 he formally joined the [[African National Congress|ANC]] and played a leading role in the 1952 ANC [[Defiance Campaign|Defiance Campaign against Unjust Laws]]. He was one of the main volunteers who travelled from village to village collecting demands of the African population that were incorporated into the ANC [[Freedom Charter]]; he attended the 1955 [[Congress of the People (1955)|Congress of the People]] in [[Kliptown]] that drew up the Freedom Charter as a delegate from Alexandra.

In 1957 Thomas Nkobi shot to prominence when he chaired the Second Alexandra Peoples Transport Committee which was co-ordinating a bus boycott in the Johannesburg and [[Pretoria]] [[Township (South Africa)|townships]] following a 25 per cent increase in bus fares. In the same year he was arrested for participating in the nationwide [[South African Potato Boycott]], following The Farm Labour Scandal, a journalistic investigation by [[Ruth First]] and [[Joe Gqabi]], which uncovered that Africans arrested for infringement of the [[pass laws]] were coerced into enforced labour on potato farms. In 1958 Thomas Nkobi became the National Organizer of the ANC and was charged with the task of implementing the M-Plan, an action plan, named after [[Nelson Mandela]], to decentralise the ANCs organizational branches and communication channels to avoid public meetings and announcements and increase effectiveness of their political and social campaign.

During the 1960 [[State of Emergency]], he was amongst the thousands of political activists who were detained. After his release he continued working for the ANC as National Organizer and was also prominent in the underground. He was [[banned]] in 1961, and in 1962 placed under a 24-hour house arrest. In 1963 Thomas Nkobi fled South Africa for exile in [[Dar es Salaam]] / [[Tanzania]] and later [[Lusaka]] / [[Zambia]], where he became actively involved in mobilising international public opinion against the Apartheid regime.

From 1968 to 1973 he served as deputy to then [[Treasurer|Treasurer General]] of the ANC, [[Moses Kotane]]. He was elected Treasurer General of the ANC in 1973, a post to which he was re-elected at all subsequent national conferences of the organisation.

After the ANC was in legalised in 1990 he returned to South Africa. There he oversaw the ANCs budget for South Africa's first democratic election, which brought the ANC to power. Thomas Nkobi was re-elected as Treasurer General in party elections in 1991 and also elected as Member of Parliament, member of the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) and member of the ANC's National Working Committee (NWC); one of several elders with moderate views who retained leadership positions.

He died on 25 September 1994, in Johannesburg after suffering a fatal stroke. He is buried at Heroes' Acre in Soweto, a section of Soweto's [[Avalon Cemetery]] reserved as final resting place for many Anti-Apartheid activists.

In 2004, Thomas Nkobi posthumously received the [[Order of Luthuli| Order of Luthuli in Gold]] for his "exceptional and selfless contribution to the struggle for a non-racial, non-sexist, free and democratic South Africa".

The '''violet-crowned woodnymph''' (''Thalurania colombica colombica''), also known as the '''purple-crowned woodnymph''', is a medium-sized [[hummingbird]] found from [[Guatemala]] and [[Belize]] to northern [[Colombia]] and western [[Venezuela]]. It is now considered by the AOU as the nominate subspecies of the [[crowned woodnymph]].

The violet-crowned woodnymph is a common to abundant bird of wet lowlands and foothills to 2500 m, and may move higher when not breeding. The female violet-crowned woodnymph is entirely responsible for nest building and incubation. She lays two white eggs in a plant-fibre cup nest 1–5 m high on a horizontal branch. Incubation takes 15–19 days, and fledging another 20-26.

The adult male violet-crowned woodnymph is 10.2&amp;nbsp;cm long and weighs 4.5 g. It has a violet crown, upper back, shoulders and belly, a shiny green throat and breast, green lower back, and a deeply forked blue-black tail. The female is 8.4–9&amp;nbsp;cm long and weighs 3.5 g. She is bright green above and duller green below, with a grey throat and breast. Her tail is rounded, mainly green near the body but with a blue-black lower half and white corners. Young males lack any violet or [[iridescence]] and are bronze-coloured below. Immature females have buff fringes on the feathers of the nape, face and rump. The call is a high-pitched fast ''kip''.

[[File:Violet-crowned Woodnymph 2496233164.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Male.]] 
The food of this species is [[nectar]], taken from a variety of flowers. Males feed in the canopy, where their food plants include [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] [[Ericaceae]] and [[bromeliad]]s, and defend flowers and scrubs in their feeding territories. Females stay in the understory. After breeding, both sexes may concentrate at ''[[Heliconia]]s''. Like other hummingbirds, violet-crowned woodnymph also takes small [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s as an essential source of [[protein]].

Sexual stereotyping and past societal barriers result in women not having the same access to ownership or control.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Women's Business Ownership Act was drafted in response to the Small Business Committee's series of six hearings on problems facing women entrepreneurs and follows the recommendations outlined in the Committee report "New Economic Realities: The Rise of Women Entrepreneurs."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Its intention is to promote equality within business opportunities for women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Congressional Findings ==
The Congressional Committee identified four barriers to women owned businesses that they wished to address.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# "the need for technical training to maximize growth potential of women owned business"
# "inequality of access to commercial credit"
# "virtual exclusion of women owned business from government procurement activities"
# "inadequacy of information and data relative to women owned business"
These findings were included in the Committee Report 100-736, which was filed on June 28, 1988. Findings like this are critical in order to formulate the basis for public policies and programs in order to benefit women entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== List of organizations that endorsed the legislation ==
* [[National Federation of Independent Business]]es
* [[National Small Business United]]
* [[Small Business Legislative Council]]
* [[National Association of Women's Business Owners]]
* [[National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs]]
* [[Women Equity Action League]]
* [[Black Women's Agenda]]

== Outcomes of the Women's Business Ownership Act ==

=== Women's Business Centers ===
The Women's Business Ownership Act provided seed funding for women's business centers through an annual grant process by the [[Small Business Administration]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Langowitz|first=Nan|last2=Sharpe|first2=Norean|last3=Godwyn|first3=Mary|title=Women's Business Centers in the United States: Effective Entrepreneurship Training and Policy Implementation|journal=Journal of Small Business &amp; Entrepreneurship|volume=19|issue=2|pages=167–182|doi=10.1080/08276331.2006.10593365|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were intended to provide technical assistance to women in order to form businesses, particularly those who were socially or economically disadvantaged. Women's business centers provide training, technical assistance, and support for entrepreneurship for women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor research project has consistently shown that women have lower entrepreneurship endeavors than men, but research on women's business centers indicate that the centers in the United States are accomplishing their intended mission.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Women lack equal access to education, finance, and other support services, such as business networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warnecke|first=Tonia|title=Capabilities, human development, and design thinking: a framework for gender-sensitive entrepreneurship programs|journal=Review of Social Economy|volume=74|issue=4|pages=420–430|doi=10.1080/00346764.2016.1201136|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women often also have to pay higher interest rates than men for similar loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Staveren|first=Irene|year=2002|title=Global Finance and Gender|url=|journal=Civil Society and Global Finance|volume=|pages=228–246|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these logistical factors, women are often influenced by societal norms, such as being unlikely to be exposed to the concept of  negotiation. The lack of resources for women entrepreneurs in daily assistance in the beginning stages of their businesses make it difficult for women to start businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warnecke|first=Tonia|year=2014|title=Are We Fostering Opportunity Entrepreneurship for Women? Exploring Policies and Programmes in China and India|url=|journal=International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management|volume=18|pages=154–181|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, women entrepreneurs are more likely than men to stay in business for only short periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nallari, Griffith, Wang, Adriamananjara, Chen, Bhattacharya|first=Raj, Breda, Yidan, Soamiely, Derek, Rwitwika|year=2012|title=A Primer on Policies for Jobs|hdl=10986/2390|journal=World Bank|volume=|pages=112–125|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women’s Business Centers seek to offer assistance with the day-to-day operations of starting a business, hoping to help women overcome the barriers they face to entrepreneurship.

Since 1995, the Center for Women in Business Enterprise in Boston and Worcester have helped over 14,000 entrepreneurs. This is indicative of the demand for such services.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Women's Business Center Program has had significant economic impact, with more than one half of the Centers showing growth in number of clients helped, gross receipts, profits, the creation of jobs, and new firms started.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Analyzing the Impact of the Women's Business Center Program|last=|first=|publisher=National Women's Business Council|year=2004|isbn=|location=Washington DC|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Women's Business Council ===
Created by the Women's Business Ownership Act, the National Women's Business Council is a non-partisan federal advisory board created to present policy advice about women small business issues to the President and Congress.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nwbc.gov|title=About NWBC|last=|first=|date=|website=National Women's Business Council|publisher=|access-date=December 18, 2016}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has resulted in the Census Bureau being required to include women business owners in its census survey.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Established in 1988, it started as an advisory board intended to identify the barriers for women-owned businesses and report annually to the president and Congress. By the early 1990s, the National Women's Business Council included women business owners, policy makers, bankers, and representatives of women's business organizations in the discussion of potential solutions to the problems women-owned businesses face, which were then presented to the president and Congress. The Small Business Reauthorization Act changed the structure of the National Women's Business Council in 1994 to its current form, which includes women business owners and representatives of women's business organizations. The law was expanded in 1998 for the National Women's Business council to include the current fifteen members.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The members of the National Women's Business Council are appointed to three year terms. The fifteen members include:&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* a chair appointed by the president
* eight women business owners or chief executives (four in the same political party as the US president and four not)
* six representatives of national women's business organizations

== Race and the Women's Business Ownership Act ==
White women working on the legislation for the Women’s Business Ownership Act were concerned that adding amendments for women of color would make the bill too controversial to pass or “putting race and sex together in the same legislation complicates the issue and might threaten the passage of the legislation.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inuzuka|first=June|year=2009|title=Women of Color and Public Policy: A Case Study of the Women's Business Ownership Act|url=|journal=International Small Business Journal|volume=27|pages=1215|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concern indicates the marginalization that women face, but also the additional barriers for women of color.

The [[National Association of Women Business Owners]] (NAWBO) was a main proponent for the passing of the bill. NAWBO argued that stereotypes of women created barriers to women business owners. However, NAWBO was hesitant to include women of color to its ranks. They were nervous that, due to the political climate of the time, adding a racial component to what was already considered progressive legislation intended to address women’s issues would provoke push back from conservatives. The coalition eventually was convinced that it was important to include women of color because their interests could be addressed by NAWBO without also involving the community of minority men business owners. A small sub-coalition was created, which consisted of the Organization of Pan Asian American Women, the Black Women’s Agenda, and the Coalition of Minority Women in Business.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Processes that are racialized and affect entrepreneurship are often gendered and classed as well.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Residential segregation, racialized social networks, and wealth inequality influence blacks’ entrepreneurial behavior by reducing their access to resources necessary to start businesses. These aspects are also influenced by gender and class.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; As of 2015, only about 5% of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies are women, and the majority are white.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/01/14/women-and-leadership/|title=Women and Leadership|date=2015-01-14|website=Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average for full-time work, a white man will earn almost 56% more than a black woman.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nwlc.org/resources/affirmative-action-and-what-it-means-women/|title=Affirmative Action and What It Means for Women – NWLC|newspaper=NWLC|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black entrepreneurs understand their business ownership within a context of race, but also within the context of other social groups, like gender.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wingfield|first=Adia Harvey|last2=Taylor|first2=Taura|title=Race, gender, and class in entrepreneurship: intersectional counterframes and black business owners|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=39|issue=9|pages=1676–1696|doi=10.1080/01419870.2016.1178789|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Socioeconomic Status and the Women's Business Ownership Act ==
Initially, women’s interest groups were accused of representing only middle- and upper-middle-class women when selecting issues to politically address. However, the interests of working class and poor women have received increased attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Women's Movement in Recent American History|last=Palley|first=Marian Lief|publisher=W.W. Norton and Company|year=1987|isbn=|location=New York|pages=150–154|quote=|via=ERIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measures implemented by the Women’s Business Ownership Act, such as the Women's Business Centers, were intentionally implemented for women of lower socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Affirmative Action for Women ==
[[Affirmative action]] programs are often used as a way to make the playing field equal for minority and women owned businesses, and can contribute to the ability for business entry and survival.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fairlie|first=Robert|last2=Marion|first2=Justin|date=2010-12-02|title=Affirmative action programs and business ownership among minorities and women|journal=Small Business Economics|language=en|volume=39|issue=2|pages=319–339|doi=10.1007/s11187-010-9305-4|issn=0921-898X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs for women can be considered in terms of education, employment, and business ownership. For women business owners, affirmative action programs are considered legislation that encourage government agencies and contractors to do business with women-owned businesses. Programs that provide financial, management, and technical assistance to women business owners are also considered to be aspects of affirmative action.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Affirmative action legislation has led to substantial improvements in the employment of minorities and women.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Affirmative Action to Open the Doors of Job Opportunity. A Policy of Fairness and Compassion That Has Worked|last=Pinkston|first=Garland|publisher=Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights|year=1984|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While affirmative action independently is not enough to provide opportunities to those facing discrimination or marginalization, evidence suggests that it is beneficial in helping women and minorities to attain more education or economic gains.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration from 1981 to 1989, or during the passage of the Women's Business Ownership Act, was adamantly opposed to affirmative action.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; There was a concern that the heavy opposition undermined the effectiveness of the policies.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Research conducted after the abolition of affirmative action in Washington and California found evidence to suggest there were slight increases in self-employment among minorities and women with no affirmative action. This is believed to be due to the [[opportunity cost]] of starting a business falling because of the restricting opportunities in a traditional labor market. However, this may not be true when considering different race and gender groups.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
