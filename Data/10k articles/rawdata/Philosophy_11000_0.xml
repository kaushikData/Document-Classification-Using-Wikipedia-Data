'''''50 reasons people give for believing in a god''''' is a 2008 book by journalist [[Guy P. Harrison]]. It was his first book. The book examines fifty common reasons that believers across the world give for believing in a god. It draws on his conversations with people while traveling both for business and pleasure in 20 years as a journalist. Harrison notes that very few people are interested in the complex arguments that go on between theologians and atheists. The people he has talked with say they believe because that is what their parents taught them, and their parents wouldn't lie to them, or because that is what it says in their book of wisdom. Of the 50 reasons, Harrison concludes that the most common reasons people believe are because it is just obvious to them, because everyone is religious so it must be true, or because it brings them happiness.&lt;ref&gt; Point of Inquiry [http://www.pointofinquiry.org/guy_p_harrison_50_reasons_people_give_for_believing_in_a_god/ August 1, 2008 Guy P.

'''Abdur Rahman Badawi''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar| عبد الرحمن بدوى}}) (February 17, 1917&amp;nbsp;– July 25, 2002) was an [[Egypt]]ian [[Existentialism|existentialist]] professor of philosophy and [[Arabic poetry|poet]]. He has been called the "foremost master of Arab existentialism."&lt;ref&gt;Mona Mikhail (1992), ''Studies in the Short Fiction of Mahfouz and Idris'', [[NYU Press]], p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He authored more than 150 works, amongst them 75 which were encyclopaedic. He wrote easily in his native [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], and read [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Latin]] and [[Farsi|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Abdel+Rahman+Badawi:+philosopher,+scholar,+thinker+and+poet....-a091660285|title=Abdel Rahman Badawi: philosopher, scholar, thinker and poet. (Obituary).|work=thefreelibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Born to a wealthy family in the village of [[Sharabass]], 95 miles from [[Cairo]], Badawi was educated at [[al-Saidiya]] school in Cairo. He graduated with a first-class degree in philosophy from the [[Egyptian University]] in 1938, and was supervised for his PhD thesis by [[Alexandre Koyre]].&lt;ref name=IndepObit&gt;'Obituary: Abdel Rahman Badawi', ''[[The Independent]]'', 1 September 2002. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-168327701.html Online] at [[HighBeam]].&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1950 to 1956 he taught at [[Ain Shams University]]. As a member of a 1954 committee to draft a new [[Egyptian constitution]], he clashed with [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]], who dissolved the committee in 1956. From 1956 to 1958 he was a [[cultural attache]] in [[Switzerland]], regarding fellow diplomats there as "ignorant and hypocritical".&lt;ref name=IndepObit/&gt;

Badawi described leaving Nasser's Egypt to teach in the [[Sorbonne]] in 1967 as escaping "the big jail". However, a professorship in [[Libya]] from 1967 to 1973 ended when [[Muammar Gaddafi]] visited the university and was embarrassed to be received by Badawi's students arguing for [[freedom of expression]]. Gaddafi imprisoned Badawi, publicly burning his personal library. His release was secured after 17 days by [[Anwar Sadat]].&lt;ref name=IndepObit/&gt;

Badawi taught at [[Kuwait University]] from 1975 to 1982.&lt;ref name=IndepObit/&gt;

Listed below are known African [[empire]]s and their respective capital cities.

==Sahelian kingdoms==
{{main|Sahelian kingdoms}}
[[File:Mapa mali.svg|thumb|[[Mali Empire]] circa 1350.]]
The Sahelian kingdoms were a series of medieval empires centred on the [[sahel]], the area of grasslands south of the [[Sahara]].
*The first major state to rise in this region was the [[Ghana Empire|Ghana Empire (Wagadu)]].  The name Ghana, often used by historians, was the regnal title given to the ruler of the Wagadu empire.&lt;ref name="The Civilizations of Africa"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Civilizations of Africa: A History to 1800 |isbn=081392085X|author1=Ehret|first1=Christopher |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Centered in what is today [[Senegal]] and [[Mauritania]], it was the first to benefit from the introduction of gold mining.  Ghana dominated the region between about 750 and 1078.  Smaller states in the region at this time included [[Takrur]] to the west, the [[Malinke]] kingdom of Mali to the south, and the [[Songhai Empire]]  centred on [[Gao]] to the east.
*When Ghana collapsed in the face of invasion from the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]], a series of brief kingdoms followed, notably that of the [[Sosso|Sosso (Susu)]]; after 1235, the [[Mali Empire]] rose to dominate the region.  Located on the [[Niger River]] to the west of Ghana in what is today [[Niger]] and [[Mali]], it reached its peak in the 1350s, but had lost control of a number of vassal states by 1400.
*The most powerful of these states was the [[Songhai Empire]], which expanded rapidly beginning with king [[Sonni Ali]] in the 1460s. By 1500, it had risen to stretch from [[Cameroon]] to the [[Maghreb]], the largest state in African history.  It too was quite short-lived and collapsed in 1591 as a result of [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[musket]]ry.
*Far to the east, on [[Lake Chad]], the state of [[Bornu Empire|Kanem-Bornu]], founded as Kanem in the 9th century, now rose to greater preeminence in the central Sahel region. To their west, the loosely united [[Hausa people|Hausa]] city-states became dominant.  These two states coexisted uneasily, but were quite stable.
*In 1810, the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] rose and conquered the Hausa, creating a more centralized state.  It and Kanem-Bornu would continue to exist until the arrival of Europeans, when both states would fall and the region would be divided between [[France]] and [[Great Britain]].
*[[Jolof Empire]] (1350–1889)

==Empires of 15th–19th century Africa==
From the 15th century until the final [[Scramble for Africa]] in the late 19th century a number of empires were also established south of the Sahel, especially in [[West Africa]].

===West Africa===
{{further|History of West Africa}}
The West African empires of this period peaked in power in the late 18th century, paralleling the peak of the [[Atlantic slave trade]].
These empires implemented a culture of permanent warfare in order to generate the required numbers of captives required to satisfy the demand for slaves by the European colonies.  With the gradual [[abolitionism|abolition]] of slavery in the European colonial empires during the 19th century, slave trade again became less lucrative and the West African empires entered a period of decline, and mostly collapsed by the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/slav/hd_slav.htm|title=The Transatlantic Slave Trade|last=Bortolot|first=Alexander Ives|date=May 2009|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Nok culture|Nok Civilization]] is considered to be one of the most advanced ancient sub-Saharan civilizations in African history. Beginning some time around 1500 BC, it was largely concentrated in what is now Nigeria but produced some of the first sub-Saharan iron smelting and [[terracotta]] architecture. Mysteriously died out around 200 AD.
*The [[Kingdom of Nri]] (1043–1911) was the [[West Africa]]n medieval state of the [[Nri-Igbo]], a subgroup of the [[Igbo people]], and is the oldest kingdom in [[Nigeria]]. The Kingdom of Nri was unusual in the history of world government in that its leader exercised no military power over his subjects. The kingdom existed as a sphere of religious and political influence over much of [[Igboland]], and was administered by a [[priest]]-[[king]] called the [[eze Nri]]. The eze Nri managed trade and diplomacy on behalf of the Igbo people, and was the possessor of divine authority in religious matters.
*The [[Oyo Empire]] (1400–1895) was a [[West African]] empire of what is today western [[Nigeria]]. The empire was established by the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] in the 15th century and grew to become one of the largest West African states. It rose to prominence through wealth gained from trade and its possession of a powerful [[cavalry]]. The Oyo Empire was the most politically important state in the region from the mid-17th to the late 18th century, holding sway not only over other Yoruba states, but also over the [[Fon people|Fon]] kingdom of [[Dahomey]] (located in the state now known as the [[Benin|Republic of Benin]]).
*[[Benin Empire]] (1440–1897), a pre-colonial African state of modern [[Nigeria]].
*[[Kaabu|Kaabu Empire]] (1537–1867), a [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] Kingdom of [[Senegambia]] (centered on modern northeastern [[Guinea-Bissau]] but extending into [[Casamance]], [[Senegal]]) that rose to prominence in the region thanks to its origins as a former province of the [[Mali Empire]]. After the decline of the Mali Empire, Kaabu became an independent kingdom.
*[[Aro Confederacy]] (1690–1902), a trading union orchestrated by the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] subgroup, the [[Aro people]], centered in [[Arochukwu]] in present-day Southeastern [[Nigeria]].
*[[Bonoman]] (11th century–19th century), earliest known Akan state.  Gold trading and Kola nut trading with Northern Neighbors brought wealth and prosperity to Akan creators of this state. Culture influenced much of modern Akan culture.
*[[Ashanti Empire]] (1701–1894), a pre-colonial Akan West African state of what is now the [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti]] Region in [[Ghana]]. The empire stretched from central [[Ghana]] to present day [[Togo]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]], bordered by the [[Dagomba people|Dagomba]] kingdom to the north and [[Dahomey]] to the east. Today, the [[List of rulers of Asante|Ashanti monarchy]] continues as one of the constitutionally protected, sub-national traditional states within the Republic of Ghana.
* Various states by [[Akan people]] (11th century–19th century)
*[[Kong Empire]] (1710–1898)  centered in north eastern [[Côte d'Ivoire]] that also encompassed much of present-day [[Burkina Faso]].
*[[Bamana Empire]] (1712–1896) based at [[Ségou]], now in [[Mali]].  It was ruled by the Kulubali or Coulibaly dynasty established c. 1640 by [[Fa Sine]] also known as [[Biton-si-u]]. The empire existed as a centralized state from 1712 to the 1861 invasion of [[Toucouleur Empire|Toucouleur]] conqueror El Hadj [[Umar Tall]].
*[[Sokoto Caliphate]] (1804–1903), an Islamic empire in [[Nigeria]], led by the [[Sultan of Sokoto]], [[Sa’adu Abubakar]]. Founded during the [[Fulani Jihad]] in the early 19th century, it was one of the most powerful empires in sub-Saharan Africa prior to European conquest and colonization. The caliphate remained extant through the colonial period and afterwards, though with reduced power.
*[[Wassoulou Empire]] (1878–1898), a short-lived empire built from the conquests of [[Dyula people|Dyula]] ruler [[Samori|Samori Ture]] and destroyed by the French colonial army.

===Great Lakes===

==Comparison==
Vansina (1962) discusses the classification of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n kingdoms, mostly of Central, South and East Africa, with some additional data on West African (Sahelian) kingdoms distinguishing five types, by decreasing centralization of power:
#'''[[Despotic]] kingdoms''': Kingdoms where the king controls the internal and external affairs directly. Examples are Ruanda, Nkore, Soga and Kongo in the 16th century
#'''Regal kingdoms''': Kingdoms where the king controls the external affairs directly, and the internal affairs via a system of overseers. The king and his chiefs belong to the same clans or lineages.
#'''Incorporative kingdoms''': Kingdoms where the king only controls only the external affairs with no permanent administrative links between him and the chiefs of the provinces. The hereditary chiefdoms of the provinces were left undisturbed after conquest. Examples are the Bamileke, Lunda, Luba, Lozi.
#'''Aristocratic kingdoms''': The only link between central authority and the provinces is payment of [[tribute]]. These kingdoms are morphologically intermediate between regal kingdoms and federations. This type is rather common in Africa, examples including the Kongo of the 17th century, the Cazembe, Luapula, Kuba, Ngonde, Mlanje, Ha, Zinza and Chagga states of the 18th century
#'''Federations''': Kingdoms (such as the [[Ashanti Union]]) where the external affairs are regulated by a council of elders headed by the king, who is simply ''primus inter pares''.

Countess '''Antonina Dmitrievna Bludova''' (Антонина Дмитриевна Блудова; 25 April 1813 – 9 April 1891) was a Russian philanthropist, [[Salon (gathering)|salonist]], memoirist and [[lady-in-waiting]].

Antonina Bludova was the eldest child of Count [[Dmitry Bludov]], one of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]'s trusted ministers and advisors. She was born in [[Stockholm]], where her father was on the Russian embassy staff. From an early age, she met [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], [[Nikolai Gogol]], [[Mikhail Lermontov]], [[Aleksey Khomyakov]] and other luminaries of the literary world. Her salon was one of the most fashionable in [[Saint Petersburg]], serving as a vital link between the imperial court and the [[Slavophile]] (or [[Pan-Slavist]]) circles. She was made a senior lady-in-waiting in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%AD%D0%A1%D0%91%D0%95/%D0%91%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%90%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%94%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0 Biography] in the [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt;

After her father's death in 1864, this influential spinster decided to leave the capital in order to devote herself to Christian causes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pravenc.ru/text/149405.html&lt;/ref&gt; She founded an Orthodox [[bratstvo]] in [[Ostroh|Ostrog]] which included an elementary school, a school for girls, a public library, a hospital, a drug store and a home for pilgrims travelling to the [[Pochaiv Lavra|Pochayev Monastery]]. She died in Moscow at the age of 77 and was buried in the [[Novodevichy Convent]]. Her memoirs were published in 1889.

'''Apatheism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|p|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|ɪ|z|əm}};{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[apathy]]'' and ''[[theism]]'') is the attitude of apathy towards the existence or non-existence of god(s). It is more of an attitude rather than a belief, claim, or belief system.&lt;ref name="nooga.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nooga.com/164154/apatheism-should-we-care-whether-god-exists/|title=Apatheism: Should we care whether God exists?|publisher=nooga.com|author=Sean Phillips|date=November 7, 2013|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20170805185445/http://nooga.com/164154/apatheism-should-we-care-whether-god-exists/|archive-date=August 5, 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-apatheist-247851 |author=Austin Cline |title=What Is an Apatheist? |website=ThoughtCo. |date=July 16, 2017 |access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An apatheist is someone who is not interested in accepting or rejecting any claims that gods exist or do not exist. The existence of god(s) is not rejected, but may be designated irrelevant.&lt;ref name="Von Hegner"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientist and philosopher Ian von Hegner has argued that apatheism is an alternative to positions such as [[theism]], [[atheism]], and [[agnosticism]], with implications that have been overlooked in modern philosophical discussions.&lt;ref name="Von Hegner"/&gt; Philosopher Trevor Hedberg has called apatheism "uncharted territory in the [[philosophy of religion]]."&lt;ref name="nooga.com"/&gt;

==Mindset==
Apatheism considers the question of the existence or nonexistence of deities to be fundamentally irrelevant in every way that matters.&lt;ref name="Von Hegner"/&gt; This position should not be understood as a skeptical position in a manner similar to that of, for example, atheists or agnostics who question the existence of deities or whether we can know about anything about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=The Atlantic |title=Let it Be |date=May 2003 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/05/let-it-be/302726/ |author=Jonathan Rauch |access-date=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of deities is not put aside for moral or epistemic reasons—for democratic or existential reasons, it is deemed unnecessary. This is a universalization of the fundamental democratic principle that there are no first- and second-class humans and that among other species or beings (including hypothetical deities or aliens elsewhere in the universe), human beings also are not second class. In this version, the existence of deities is thus not one of the so-called grand questions in life.&lt;ref name="Von Hegner"/&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=September 2018}}
The term apatheist was coined by Stuart D. Johnson to describe the attitudinal disinterest in theism that "accompanies the shift from sacred to secular orientations in the contemporary world." &lt;ref&gt;Stuart D. Johnson "The Correctional Chaplaincy: Sociological Perspectives in a Time of Rapid Change,” &lt;i&gt;Canadian Journal of Criminology and Corrections&lt;/i&gt;, 14, No. 2: 173. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasoning==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2017}}

=== Irrelevance ===
Apatheists may feel that even if there was a god/deity and the existence and legitimacy of them were proven, it would not make a difference to him/her for one reason or another, therefore, which one(s), if any, are real does not matter and any discussion about it is meaningless. This approach is similar to [[#Practical atheism|that of practical atheism]].

=== Lack of interest ===
An apatheist may not have any interest in the god debate simply for lack of interest in the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/academic-activist-or-apatheist-what-kind-of-unbeliever-are-you/2014/06/09/5b347b18-f00c-11e3-ba99-4469323d5076_story.html?utm_term=.348a9e0d0c68|author=Kimberly Winston|title=Academic, activist or apatheist: What kind of unbeliever are you?|publisher=washingtonpost.com|date=June 9, 2014|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morality ===
This apatheistic argument states that morals do not come from god and that if a god exists there would be no changes with regards to morality, therefore a god's existence or non-existence is irrelevant.

==Related views==
===Apathetic agnosticism===
A view related to apatheism, apathetic agnosticism claims that no amount of debate can prove or disprove the existence of one or more deities, and if one or more deities exist, they do not appear to be concerned about the fate of humans. Therefore, their existence has little to no impact on personal human affairs and should be of little interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apatheticagnostic.com/ourchurch/faith.html |title=Commentary on the Articles of Faith |author=John Tyrrell |year=1996 |quote=To believe in the existence of a god is an act of faith. To believe in the nonexistence of a god is likewise an act of faith. There is no verifiable evidence that there is a [[Supreme Being]] nor is there verifiable evidence there is not a Supreme Being. Faith is not knowledge. We can only state with assurance that we do not know. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807021506/http://www.apatheticagnostic.com/ourchurch/faith.html |archivedate=2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/basic-facts-about-agnosticism-and-agnostics-248036 |author=Austin Cline |title=Agnosticism for Beginners - Basic Facts About Agnosticism and Agnostics |website=ThoughtCo. |date=March 8, 2017 |access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The view that one should live their life with disregard towards a god or gods. Practical atheism doesn't see the god question as irrelevant, in contrast to apatheism.&lt;ref name =ZofiaJ&gt;{{cite book

The '''Australasian Association of Philosophy''' ('''AAP''') is the peak body for philosophy in Australasia. The chief purpose of the AAP is to promote philosophy in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Singapore]]. Among the means that it follows to achieve this end, the AAP runs an annual conference, publishes two journals, awards various prizes, sponsors postgraduate and undergraduate philosophical activities, maintains affiliations with numerous other organisations that aim to promote philosophy and philosophical activity, and promotes philosophy in schools, cafes, pubs, and everywhere else that philosophy may be found.

== History ==
The AAP was formed in 1922. Until 1958, it was as the ''Australasian Association of Psychology and Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27439184 "Philosophy",''The Queenslander'', (Saturday, 23 December 1922), p.3.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22633835 "Psychology and Philosophy: An Australian Society", ''The West Australian'', (Monday, 23 April 1923), p.11.]&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of the journal appeared in 1923, and the first annual conference was held in Sydney in 1923.

When it was founded, the Association had a number of State branches in Australia, including a branch in Victoria and a branch in New South Wales. These state branches had all ceased functioning well before the close of the twentieth century.

A New Zealand Division of the Australasian Association of Philosophy (AAPNZ) was formally established in 1978. It was constituted by AAP members who were or had been active in New Zealand philosophy. The NZ Division held an Annual Conference in early December. The first such conference was held at [[Canterbury Christ Church University|Canterbury University College, Christchurch]] in 1953. AAPNZ was formally disestablished in 2011. The organisation of the Annual Conference in early December is now the responsibility of the New Zealand Association of Philosophy (NZAP).

Singapore became a region of the AAP in 2002.

== Journals ==
[[Image:Australasian Association of Psychology and Philosophy.JPG|right|340px|thumb|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''Sydney Morning Herald'', Tuesday, 14 October 1924.]]
The AAP is responsible for the publication of ''[[Australasian Journal of Philosophy]] (AJP)'', which is Australasia's oldest [[philosophy journal]]. Various independent rankings list the AJP in the top ten generalist philosophy journals in the world.

The AAP is also launching a second journal, ''Australasian Philosophical Review'' (APR), the first issue of which is due to appear in July, 2016.[https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=rapr20]

== Conference ==
The association is responsible for the organisation of the annual AAP [[Academic conference|conference]], which always commences on the first Sunday in July. Held over five days, this conference is designed to give professional philosophers the opportunity to present and discuss papers in all areas of philosophy. Each year it attracts up to 300 philosophers from all parts of the globe.

== Prizes ==
The AAP awards a number of annual prizes. These include:
* The AJP Best Paper Award [[Australasian Journal of Philosophy#AJP Best Paper Award|for the best paper published in the Australasian Journal of Philosophy]].
* The AAP Media Prize, for the best philosophical piece published by a professional philosopher in the popular media in Australasia.
* The AAP Media Professionals Prize, for the best contribution by a media professional to the promotion of philosophy in the popular media in Australasia.
* The AAP Innovation in Inclusive Curricula Prize, for the most innovative development of inclusive curriculum by professional philosophers working in Australasia.
* The AAP Philosothon Prize, for the best student contributions at the annual Australian [[Philosothon]].&lt;ref&gt;"A Philosothon is an event that encourages school students to investigate ethical and other philosophical questions in the context of ‘communities of inquiry’. Participating in the event helps students to develop higher order thinking and communication skills through a series of discussions with students from other schools. These discussions are facilitated by philosophy teachers and adjudicated by a panel with appropriate academic or educational qualifications. While there is an element of competition in a Philosothon, it aims to promote a sense of community by developing a shared understanding of values and purposes in a spirit of cooperation. It also develops skills in inquiry-based learning, ethical reasoning, higher-order reflective thinking and a search for meaning through dialogue about open questions and contestable concepts." ([http://fapsa.org.au/philosothon Federation of Australasian Philosophy in Schools Associations: Philosothon]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Affiliations ==
The AAP maintains affiliations with FISP ([[International Federation of Philosophical Societies|Fédération Internationale des Sociétés de Philosophie]]), the APA ([[American Philosophical Association]]), the BPA ([[British Philosophical Association]]), the ACPA ([[Canadian Philosophical Association|L'Association canadienne de philosophie]]), FAPSA ([[Federation of Australasian Philosophy in Schools Associations]]), CHASS ([[Council for the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences]]), and a range of Australasian philosophical associations that are devoted to particular sub-disciplines or sub-areas of philosophy.

The '''Bodmer Foundation''' (French: ''Fondation Bodmer'') is a library and museum specialised in manuscripts and precious editions. It is located in [[Cologny]], [[Switzerland]] just outside [[Geneva]].

Also known as '''Bibliotheca Bodmeriana'''  (or '''Bodmer Library'''), it is a Swiss [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage site of national significance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar/a-objekte.parsys.000102.DownloadFile.tmp/ge.pdf |title=Kantonsliste A-Objekte:Geneva |year=2009 |work=KGS Inventar |publisher=Federal Office of Civil Protection |language=German |accessdate=12 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928140001/http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar/a-objekte.parsys.000102.DownloadFile.tmp/ge.pdf |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The library was established by [[Martin Bodmer]] and is famous as the home of the [[Bodmer Papyri]]. Some of these papyri are among the oldest remaining copies of the [[New Testament]]. Some manuscripts are written in Greek, others in Coptic (e.g. ''Papyrus Bodmer III''). The first of the manuscripts was purchased in 1956 (''Papyrus Bodmer II'' — P&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;). It also houses a copy of the [[Gutenberg Bible]].

==History==

Martin Bodmer established the library in the 1920s. Bodmer selected the works centering on what he saw as the five pillars of [[world literature]]: the [[Bible]], [[Homer]], [[Dante Alighieri]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].&lt;ref name="koch"&gt;Koch, Hans-Albrecht: [http://www.aski.org/kb2_00/kb200marbach2a.htm Spiegel der Welt: Die Bibliotheca Bodmeriana zu Gast im Schiller-Nationalmuseum / Deutsches Literaturarchiv in Marbach] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121222727/http://www.aski.org/kb2_00/kb200marbach2a.htm |date=2008-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He prioritized [[autographs]] and first editions. 1951 Bodmer had built two neo-baroque houses in Cologny to accommodate the collection.

In 1970, shortly before Bodmer's death, the Bodmer Foundation was established to make the collection accessible and conserve it. In 2003 the building was remodelled by [[Mario Botta]]. He connected the cellars of the two houses by a two-story underground structure, pierced by light shafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botta.ch/Page/Re%202003_353_Bodmer_it%20(Pu).php |title=Mario Botta: Fondazione Martin Bodmer - Biblioteca e Museo, Cologny |publisher=Botta.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Items ==
The collection comprises some 160,000 items, including Sumerian clay tablets, Greek papyri and handwritten originals including music sheets. He aimed at representing the historical context by adding political, philosophical and scientific items.&lt;ref name="koch"/&gt; Some samples are:
* Oldest surviving copy of the [[Gospel of James]]
* A [[Gutenberg Bible]], 1452
* First edition print of [[Martin Luther]]'s [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]], 1517
* A copy of Newton's ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' once owned by [[Gottfried Leibniz]]
* [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s draft manuscript of ''[[Nathan the Wise]]'', 1778
* [[Papyrus 66]], [[Papyrus 73]] and [[Papyrus 74]]
* Original manuscript scroll of ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]'' by [[Marquis de Sade]].
* [[Minuscule 556]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10238">The '''Code of Conduct for International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief''' was drawn up in 1992 by the [[Steering Committee for Humanitarian Response]] (SCHR) to set ethical standards for organizations involved in humanitarian work.  In 1994, the SCHR adopted the code and made the signing of it a condition for membership in the alliance.

==Formulation of the code==
Although the initiative began with a call by the [[French Red Cross]] to the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|IFRC]] to draw up a code of conduct relating to humanitarian aid in response to [[natural disasters]], many of the sponsoring agencies had been involved in [[complex emergencies]] such as [[Biafra]] and [[Rwanda]] and were also looking for guidance for operating in the midst of violent conflicts.  {{as of|2016|December}} more than 600 organizations have signed the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=IFRC|title=The Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in Disaster Relief|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/publications-and-reports/code-of-conduct/signatories-of-the-code-of-conduct-/|publisher=International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, at the 26th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, which included delegates from governments, the Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies, the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|IFRC]], and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]], a resolution was passed which “took note of” and “welcomed” the code giving it wide international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=IFRC|title=Resolution 4: Principles and action in international humanitarian assistance and protection|url=http://www.ifrc.org/docs/idrl/I413EN.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Code articles==

Principle Commitments of the Code&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifrc.org/publicat/conduct/code.asp Code of Conduct]&lt;/ref&gt;

#The [[humanitarian imperative]] comes first; 
#Aid is given regardless of the race, creed or nationality of the recipients and without adverse distinction of any kind. Aid priorities are calculated on the basis of need alone; 
#Aid will not be used to further a particular political or religious standpoint; 
#We shall endeavor not to be used as an instrument of government foreign policy; 
#We shall respect culture and custom; 
#We shall attempt to build disaster response on local capacities; 
#Ways shall be found to involve program beneficiaries in the management of relief aid; 
#Relief aid must strive to reduce vulnerabilities to future disaster as well as meeting basic needs;
#We hold ourselves accountable to both those we seek to assist and those from whom we accept resources; 
#In our information, publicity and advertising activities, we shall recognize disaster victims as dignified human beings, not hopeless objects.

==Types of principles==
The 10 articles of the code fall into two types:  Articles 1 through 4 are core [[humanitarian principles]] required for humanitarian response.  The remaining articles are more aspirational and are important to improving the quality of both humanitarian and developmental work.

The humanitarian imperative, based on the [[Humanitarian principles#Humanity|principle of humanity]], together with other core principles, [[impartiality]], and independence, stress that [[humanitarian response]] must be based on need alone.  They are derived, from the Fundamental Principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Red Cross movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/EA08067453343B76C1256D2600383BC4?OpenDocument&amp;Style=Custo_Final.3&amp;View=defaultBody Fundamental Principles]&lt;/ref&gt;  However the principle of [[Humanitarian principles#Neutrality|neutrality]], which is directly related to the special international role of the Red Cross is not included in the code of conduct.  Organizations such as military forces and for-profit companies may deliver assistance to communities affected by disaster, but they are not considered by the humanitarian sector as humanitarian agencies as they do not meet all of the core principles.

Articles, 5 through 10, are derived particularly from experience in development work.  Most of the original sponsors have had decades of experience working in the development sector and the articles reflect their experience and commitment.  Some development agencies are deeply committed to such an approach while being unable to subscribe to the core principles.

==Voluntary nature==
The code of conduct is a voluntary code which is self-enforced by each of the signatory organizations.

The code includes two annexes, Annex I, Recommendations to governments of disaster affected countries, and Annex II, Recommendations to donor governments.

==Application of the Code==

The code of conduct is widely used to guide conduct within humanitarian agencies. When the code was drawn up a new term was coined: Non governmental humanitarian agencies (NGHAs), to include the [[NGO]]s and the components of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] which are not NGOs.

The Disaster Emergency Committee (DEC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dec.org.uk Disaster Emergency Committee]&lt;/ref&gt; which is based in the UK has used the code for evaluating humanitarian action, beginning with an evaluation of the [[Gujarat earthquake of 2001]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dec.org.uk/uploads/documents/india_earthquake2002_report_summary.pdf Executive summary]&lt;/ref&gt; and covering many subsequent evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dec.org.uk/index.cfm/asset_id,905/index.html Appeals and evaluations]&lt;/ref&gt; The evaluators have used the code as a framework, presenting their findings of agencies' performances in relation to each principle in the Code.

==Limits and misinterpretations==

Evaluators differ about the usefulness of the code.  In the DEC evaluation of the Gujarat earthquake of 2001, the evaluators concluded 
:"The Red Cross Code can be used effectively in evaluation as a measure of quality. In the full report we take each Principle in turn, focus on key issues (as far as possible those specified in the terms of reference) and then examine performance against the Principle. We are able to show which Principles require more attention and thus focus attention on learning."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dec.org.uk/uploads/documents/india_earthquake2002_report_summary.pdf Gujerat evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, because of the lack of indicators of compliance with code they were forced to rate overall performance based on the aggregation of their impressions and judgement rather than on an objective measurement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dec.org.uk/uploads/documents/india_earthquake2002_report_summary.pdf Gujerat evaluation, p. 14]&lt;/ref&gt; The evaluators of the DEC Tsunami Crisis Response were unable to  do this because of different perceptions of different team members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/12_01_06_DEC_tsunami_evaluation_final_report.pdf Independent Evaluation of the DEC Tsunami Crisis Response, p. 46]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the opening paragraph of the executive summary of the Tsunami evaluation states 
:"Following usual DEC practice, the primary measure of assessment is the Red Cross Code. This is a precise set of standards, signed up to by all DEC members; by using the standards, personal judgement by the evaluators can be kept to a minimum."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.validinternational.org/docs/Independent%20Evaluation%20of%20the%20DEC%20Tsunami%20Crisis%20Response,%20December%202005.pdf Tsunami evaluation, p 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is at odds with the conclusions of Hillhorst's review of the code&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/ref/10.1111/j.0361-3666.2005.00297.x Dorothea Hilhorst, Dead letter or living document? Ten years of the Code of Conduct for disaster relief. Disasters ''Vol. 29 Issue 4 Page 351 December 2005, p. 364]&lt;/ref&gt; which states:
:"The code does not provide ... clear proactive regulation with respect to the provision of humanitarian aid. The code is not regulatory because of its cautious language, with phrases like ‘we shall endeavour to’, instead of ‘we shall’.  By using this language, room for manoeuvre is also created for international [[NGOs]] with different approaches. The cautious language makes the code comprehensive and appropriate as an instrument for discussing policy and operational matters and dilemmas. It makes the code less useful, though, for NGOs seeking guidance vis-à-vis their actions and for purposes of accountability."

Hillhorst's paper draws on a survey of code signatories and a conference to review the code, as well as detailed analysis of the code itself.

'''DataViva''' is an [[information visualization]] engine created by the Strategic Priorities Office of the government of [[Minas Gerais]]. DataViva makes official data about exports, industries, locations and occupations available for the entirety of [[Brazil]] through eight apps and more than 100&amp;nbsp;million possible visualizations.

The first set of datum – also available at [[ALICEWEB]] – is provided by MDIC (Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade) / SECEX (Secretariat of Foreign Trade), an official institution of the [[Government of Brazil]] and shows [[foreign trade]] statistics for all exporting municipalities in the country. The other database, provided by [[Ministério do Trabalho e Emprego]] (MTE – [[Ministry of Labor and Employment (Brazil)|Ministry of Labor and Employment]]), shows information about all of the industries and occupations in [[Brazil]] (RAIS – Annual Social Information Report).

The platform consists of eight core applications, each of which allows different ways of visualizing the data available. Some applications are descriptive, that is, showing data aggregated at various levels in a simple and comparative way, such as [[Treemapping]]. Others are prescriptive, using calculations that allow an analytic visualization of the data, based on theories such as [[the Product Space]]. All of the applications are generated using [[D3plus]], an open source&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=d3plus source|url=https://github.com/alexandersimoes/d3plus/|accessdate=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[JavaScript]] library built on top of [[D3.js]] by [[Alexander Simoes]] and [[Dave Landry]].

Inspired by [[The Observatory of Economic Complexity]], DataViva is an [[open data]],&lt;ref name="dataviva"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dataviva.info/about/terms_of_use |title=DataViva : Terms of Use |publisher=dataviva.info |accessdate=July 7, 2014 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[open-source software|open-source]],&lt;ref name="githubusercontent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexandersimoes/dataviva/master/LICENSE|title=LICENSE|publisher=raw.githubusercontent.com|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and free to use tool.

It was developed in a partnership with [[MIT Media Lab]] Professor César Hidalgo and is maintained by the Government of [[Minas Gerais]].

The '''Declaration of Helsinki''' ('''DoH''', {{lang-fi|Helsingin julistus}}, {{lang-sv|Helsingforsdeklarationen}}) is a set of ethical principles regarding [[human experimentation]] developed for the medical community by the [[World Medical Association]] (WMA).&lt;ref name="jama.jamanetwork.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=World Medical Association|title=Declaration of Helsinki: Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects|journal=JAMA|date=2013|volume=310|issue=20|pages=2191–2194|doi=10.1001/jama.2013.281053|pmid=24141714|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1760318|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded as the cornerstone document on human [[research ethics]].&lt;ref name="jama.jamanetwork.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wma.net/e/press/2000_8.htm WMA Press Release: WMA revises the Declaration of Helsinki. 9 October 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927052340/http://www.wma.net/e/press/2000_8.htm |date=27 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bošnjak"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Bošnjak |last1=Snežana |year=2001 |title=The declaration of Helsinki: The cornerstone of research ethics |journal=Archive of Oncology |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=179–84 |url=http://scindeks.ceon.rs/article.aspx?artid=0354-73100103179B&amp;lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyebkhan 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tyebkhan |first1=G |title=Declaration of Helsinki: the ethical cornerstone of human clinical research |journal=Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=245–7 |year=2003 |pmid=17642902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
The Declaration is morally binding on physicians, and that obligation overrides any national or local laws or regulations, if the Declaration provides for a higher standard of protection of humans than the latter. Investigators still have to abide by local legislation but will be held to the higher standard.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Basic principles===

The fundamental principle is respect for the individual (Article 8), their right to self-determination and the right to make [[informed consent|informed decisions]] (Articles 20, 21 and 22) regarding participation in research, both initially and during the course of the research. The investigator's duty is solely to the patient (Articles 2, 3 and 10) or volunteer (Articles 16, 18), and while there is always a need for research (Article 6), the subject's welfare must always take precedence over the interests of science and society (Article 5), and ethical considerations must always take precedence over laws and regulations (Article 9).

The recognition of the increased vulnerability of individuals and groups calls for special vigilance (Article 8). It is recognized that when the research participant is incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, or is a minor (Articles 23, 24), then allowance should be considered for surrogate consent by an individual acting in the subject's best interest, although their consent should still be obtained if at all possible (Article 25).

===Operational principles===
Research should be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific background (Article 11), a careful assessment of risks and benefits (Articles 16, 17), have a reasonable likelihood of benefit to the population studied (Article 19) and be conducted by suitably trained investigators (Article 15) using approved protocols, subject to independent ethical review and oversight by a properly convened committee (Article 13). The protocol should address the ethical issues and indicate that it is in compliance with the Declaration (Article 14). Studies should be discontinued if the available information indicates that the original considerations are no longer satisfied (Article 17). Information regarding the study should be publicly available (Article 16). Ethical publications extend to publication of the results and consideration of any potential conflict of interest (Article 27).     Experimental investigations should always be compared against the best methods, but under certain circumstances a placebo or no treatment group may be utilised (Article 29). The interests of the subject after the study is completed should be part of the overall ethical assessment, including assuring their access to the best proven care (Article 30). Wherever possible unproven methods should be tested in the context of research where there is reasonable belief of possible benefit (Article 32).

===Additional guidelines or regulations===
Investigators often find themselves in the position of having to follow several different codes or guidelines, and are therefore required to understand the differences between them. One of these is [[Good clinical practice|Good Clinical Practice]] (GCP), an international guide, while each country may also have local regulations such as the [https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html Common Rule] in the US, in addition to the requirements of the FDA and Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) in that country. There are a number of available tools which compare these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparison of Common Rule with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice|url=http://www.tera.org/Publications/comparisontable.pdf|accessdate=26 August 2012|author=Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment|date=August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other countries have guides with similar roles, such as the [http://www.pre.ethics.gc.ca/pdf/eng/tcps2/TCPS_2_FINAL_Web.pdf Tri-Council Policy Statement] in Canada. Additional international guidelines include those of the [http://www.cioms.ch CIOMS], [http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/fileLibrary/pdf/HRRDC_Follow-up_Discussion_Paper001.pdf Nuffield Council] and [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001461/146180E.pdf UNESCO].

==History==
The Declaration was originally adopted in June 1964 in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], and has since undergone seven revisions (the most recent at the General Assembly in October 2013) and two clarifications, growing considerably in length from 11 paragraphs in 1964 to 37 in the 2013 version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of Helsinki History Website|url=http://sites.jamanetwork.com/declaration-of-helsinki/index.html|website=Ethical Principles For Medical Research|publisher=The JAMA Network|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration is an important document in the history of research ethics as it is the first significant effort of the medical community to regulate research itself, and forms the basis of most subsequent documents.

Prior to the 1947 [[Nuremberg Code]] there was no generally accepted code of conduct governing the ethical aspects of human research, although some countries, notably Germany and Russia, had national policies [3a]. The Declaration developed the ten principles first stated in the Nuremberg Code, and tied them to the [[Declaration of Geneva]] (1948), a statement of physicians' ethical duties. The Declaration more specifically addressed clinical research, reflecting changes in medical practice from the term '[[Human experimentation|Human Experimentation]] used in the Nuremberg Code. A notable change from the Nuremberg Code was a relaxation of the conditions of consent, which was 'absolutely essential' under Nuremberg. Now doctors were asked to obtain consent 'if at all possible' and research was allowed without consent where a proxy consent, such as a legal guardian, was available (Article II.1).

===First revision (1975)===
The 1975 revision was almost twice the length of the original. It clearly stated that "concern for the interests of the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society."&lt;ref&gt;Vanderpool, Harold Y. (1996). The Ethics of Research Involving Human Subjects: Facing the 21st Century. Frederick, Maryland: University Publishing Group, Inc. p. 85. {{ISBN|1-55572-036-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also introduced the concept of oversight by an 'independent committee' (Article I.2) which became a system of [[Institutional Review Board]]s (IRB) in the US, and research ethics committees or ethical review boards in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.6080.173 |author=[[Povl Riis|Riis P]] |title=Letter from...Denmark. Planning of scientific-ethical committees |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=2 |issue=6080 |pages=173–4 |date=July 1977 |pmid=871832 |pmc=1631019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States regulations governing IRBs came into effect in 1981 and are now encapsulated in the [[Common rule|Common Rule]]. Informed consent was developed further, made more prescriptive and partly moved from 'Medical Research Combined with Professional Care' into the first section (Basic Principles), with the burden of proof for not requiring consent being placed on the investigator to justify to the committee. 'Legal guardian' was replaced with 'responsible relative'. The duty to the individual was given primacy over that to society (Article I.5), and concepts of publication ethics were introduced (Article I.8). Any experimental manoeuvre was to be compared to the best available care as a comparator (Article II.2), and access to such care was assured (Article I.3). The document was also made gender neutral.

===Second to Fourth revisions (1975&amp;ndash;2000)===
Subsequent revisions between 1975 and 2000 were relatively minor, so the 1975 version was effectively that which governed research over a quarter of a century of relative stability.

====Second and Third Revisions (1983, 1989)====
The second revision (1983) included seeking the consent of minors where possible. The third revision (1989) dealt further with the function and structure of the independent committee. However, from 1993 onwards, the Declaration was not alone as a universal guide since [[CIOMS]] and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) had also developed their [[CIOMS Guidelines|International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects]].

====Fourth revision (1996)====

=====Background=====
The AIDS Clinical Trials Group ([[ACTG]]) Study 076 of 100 [[Zidovudine]] in maternal-infant transmission of [[HIV]] had been published in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connor|first=Edward M.|last2=Sperling|first2=Rhoda S.|last3=Gelber|first3=Richard|last4=Kiselev|first4=Pavel|last5=Scott|first5=Gwendolyn|last6=O'Sullivan|first6=Mary Jo|last7=VanDyke|first7=Russell|last8=Bey|first8=Mohammed|last9=Shearer|first9=William|date=1994-11-03|title=Reduction of Maternal-Infant Transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 with Zidovudine Treatment|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=331|issue=18|pages=1173–1180|doi=10.1056/NEJM199411033311801|issn=0028-4793|pmid=7935654}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a [[placebo]] controlled trial which showed a reduction of nearly 70% in the risk of transmission, and Zidovudine became a ''de facto'' [[standard of care]]. The subsequent initiation of further placebo controlled trials carried out in developing countries and funded by the United States [[Centers for Disease Control]] or [[National Institutes of Health]] raised considerable concern when it was learned that patients in trials in the US had essentially unrestricted access to the drug, while those in developing countries did not. Justification was provided by a 1994 WHO group in Geneva which concluded "''Placebo-controlled trials offer the best option for a rapid and scientifically valid assessment of alternative antiretroviral drug regimens to prevent transmission of HIV''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |date=June 23, 1994 |title=Recommendations from the Meeting on Prevention of Mother-to-Infant Transmission of HIV by Use of Antiretrovirals |url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/5571095.0283.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These trials appeared to be in direct conflict with recently published guidelines&lt;ref name="Levine 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levine RJ |title=New international ethical guidelines for research involving human subjects |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=119 |issue=4 |pages=339–41 |date=August 1993 |pmid=8328746 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-119-4-199308150-00016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for international research by [[CIOMS]], which stated "''The ethical standards applied should be no less exacting than they would be in the case of research carried out in country''", referring to the sponsoring or initiating country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences]] |title=International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |location=Geneva |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=978-92-9036-056-8 |url=http://www.codex.uu.se/texts/international.html |chapter=Guideline 11: Selection of pregnant or nursing (breastfeeding) women as research subjects |chapterurl=http://www.codex.uu.se/texts/international.html#pregnant}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In fact a schism between ethical universalism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Angell M |title=Ethical imperialism?

=====Fourth revision=====
In retrospect, this was one of the most significant revisions because it added the phrase "''This does not exclude the use of inert placebo in studies where no proven diagnostic or therapeutic method exists''" to Article II.3 ("''In any medical study, every patient--including those of a control group, if any—should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method.''"). Critics claimed that the Zidovudine trials in developing countries were in breach of this because Zidovudine was now the best proven treatment and the placebo group should have been given it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb05486.x |title=Some Recent Developments in the International Guidelines on the Ethics of Research Involving Human Subjectsa |year=2006 |last1=Levine |first1=Robert J. |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=918 |issue=1 |pages=170–8 |pmid=11131702|bibcode=2000NYASA.918..170L }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) ignoring this and all subsequent revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm124932.htm|title=Search for FDA Guidance Documents - Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and Research,Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,Center for Devices and Radiological|last=Health|website=www.fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="temple"&gt;Temple R.

===Fifth revision (2000)===

====Background====
Following the fourth revision in 1996 pressure began to build almost immediately for a more fundamental approach to revising the declaration.&lt;ref name="Levine 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levine RJ |title=The need to revise the Declaration of Helsinki |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=341 |issue=7 |pages=531–4 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10441613 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199908123410713}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later revision in 2000 would go on to require monitoring of scientific research on human subjects to assure ethical standards were being met.&lt;ref name="Grady 2001 1449–1453"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grady|first=Christine|author2=Forster, Heidi P. and Emanuel, Ezekiel|title=The 2000 Revision of the Declaration of Helsinki: A Step Forward or More Confusion?|journal=The Lancet|date=October 2001|volume=358|issue=9291|pages=1449–1453|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06534-5|pmid=11705513|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1259777|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 Lurie and Wolfe published their seminal paper on HIV trials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lurie P, Wolfe SM |title=Unethical trials of interventions to reduce perinatal transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus in developing countries |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=337 |issue=12 |pages=853–6 |date=September 1997 |pmid=9295246 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199709183371212|last2=Wolfe }}&lt;/ref&gt; raising awareness of a number of central issues. These included the claims that the continuing trials in developing countries were unethical, and pointing out a fundamental discrepancy in decisions to change the study design in Thailand but not Africa. The issue of the use of [[placebo]] in turn raised questions about the standard of care in developing counties and whether, as [[Marcia Angell]] wrote "''Human subjects in any part of the world should be protected by an irreducible set of ethical standards''" (1988). The American Medical Association put forward a proposed revision in November that year,&lt;ref&gt;General Assembly WMA Hamburg, Germany 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Americans want to water down Helsinki Declaration |journal=Bulletin of Medical Ethics |volume=136 |pages=3–4 |year=1998 |pmid=11657531}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a proposed revision (17.C/Rev1/99) was circulated the following year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/case/azt/ethics/hels_rev.html|title=Harvard Kennedy School Case Program|website=www.ksg.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=World Medical |first1=Association |title=Proposed revision of the Declaration of Helsinki |journal=Bulletin of Medical Ethics |volume=147 |pages=18–22 |year=1999 |pmid=11657218}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing considerable debate and resulting in a number of symposia and conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nicholson |first1=RH |last2=Crawley |first2=FP |title=Revising the Declaration of Helsinki: a fresh start |journal=Bulletin of Medical Ethics |volume=151 |pages=13–7 |year=1999 |pmid=11657985}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Recommendations included limiting the document to basic guiding principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = WMA Medical Ethics Committee | year = 1999 | title = Updating the WMA Declaration of Helsinki | url = | journal = Wld Med J | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 11–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Deutsch E, Taupitz J | year = 1999 | title = Göttingen Report.

Others saw it as an example of Angell's 'Ethical Imperialism', an imposition of US needs on the developing world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nicholson |first1=RH |title=If it ain't broke, don't fix it |journal=[[Hastings Center Report]] |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=6 |year=2000 |pmid=11645209 |doi=10.2307/3527987|jstor=3527987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and resisted any but the most minor changes, or even a partitioned document with firm principles and commentaries, as used by CIOMS. The idea of ethical imperialism was brought into high attention with HIV testing, as it was strongly debated from 1996-2000 because of its centrality to the issue of regimens to prevent its vertical transmission.&lt;ref name="Grady 2001 1449–1453"/&gt;  Brennan summarises this by stating "''The principles exemplified by the current Declaration of Helsinki represent a delicate compromise that we should modify only after careful deliberation''". Nevertheless, what had started as a controversy over a specific series of trials and their designs in Sub-Saharan Africa, now had potential implications for all research. These implications further came into public view since the Helsinki declaration had stated, "In the treatment of the sick person, the physician must be free to use a new diagnostic and therapeutic measure, if in his or her judgement, it offers hope of saving life, reestablishing health or alleviating suffering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vanderpool|first=Harold Y.|title=The Ethics of Research Involving Human Subjects: Facing the 21st Century|year=1996|publisher=University Publishing Group, Inc.|location=Frederick, Maryland|isbn=978-1-55572-036-0|pages=433–436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fifth revision====
Even though most meetings about the proposed revisions failed to achieve consensus, and many argued that the declaration should remain unchanged or only minimally altered, after extensive consultation the Workgroup
&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Dickey, Kati Myllymäki, Judith Kazimirsky&lt;/ref&gt;
eventually came up with a text that was endorsed by WMA's Council and passed by the General Assembly on October 7, 2000,
&lt;ref name=Christie&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christie B |title=Doctors revise Declaration of Helsinki |journal=BMJ |volume=321 |issue=7266 |pages=913 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11030663 |pmc=1118720 |doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7266.913}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and which proved to be the most far reaching and contentious revision to date. The justification for this was partly to take account of expanded scope of biomedical research since 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/284/23/3045 Riis P. Perspectives on the fifth revision of the Declaration of Helsinki. JAMA 2000 Dec 20 284(23): 3045-6]&lt;/ref&gt; This involved a restructuring of the document, including renumbering and re-ordering of all the articles, the changes in which are outlined in this [https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/nhrpac/mtg12-00/h2000-1996.pdf Table]. The Introduction establishes the rights of subjects and describes the inherent tension between the need for research to improve the common good, and the rights of the individual. The Basic Principles establish a guide for judging to what extent proposed research meets the expected ethical standards. The distinction between therapeutic and non-therapeutic research introduced in the original document, criticised by Levine&lt;ref name="Levine 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb05486.x |last1=Levine |first1=RJ |title=Some recent developments in the international guidelines on the ethics of research involving human subjects |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=918 |issue=1 |pages=170–8 |year=2000 |pmid=11131702|bibcode=2000NYASA.918..170L }}&lt;/ref&gt; was removed to emphasise the more general application of ethical principles, but the application of the principles to healthy volunteers is spelt out in Articles 18-9, and they are referred to in Article 8 ('those who will not benefit personally from the research') as being especially vulnerable. The scope of ethical review was increased to include human tissue and data (Article 1), the necessity to challenge accepted care was added (Article 6), as well as establishing the primacy of the ethical requirements over laws and regulations (Article 9).

Amongst the many changes was an increased emphasis on the need to benefit the communities in which research is undertaken, and to draw attention to the ethical problems of experimenting on those who would not benefit from the research, such as developing countries in which innovative medications would not be available. Article 19 first introduces the concept of social justice, and extends the scope from individuals to the community as a whole by stating that 'research is only justified if there is a reasonable likelihood that the populations in which the research is carried out stand to benefit from the results of the research'. This new role for the Declaration has been both denounced
&lt;ref name="temple" /&gt;
and praised, 
&lt;ref name="Macklin"/&gt; Macklin R. Future challenges for the Declaration of Helsinki: Maintaining credibility in the face of ethical controversies. Address to Scientific Session, World Medical Association General Assembly, September 2003, Helsinki
and even considered for a clarification footnote.&lt;ref name=Carlson&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carlson |first1=Robert V. |last2=Boyd |first2=Kenneth M. |last3=Webb |first3=David J. |title=The revision of the Declaration of Helsinki: past, present and future |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=695–713 |year=2004 |pmid=15151515 |pmc=1884510 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2004.02103.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 27 expanded the concept of publication ethics, adding the necessity to disclose conflict of interest (echoed in Articles 13 and 22), and to include publication bias amongst ethically problematic behavior.

=====Additional Principles=====

The most controversial revisions
&lt;ref name="Macklin"/&gt;
(Articles 29, 30) were placed in this new category. These predictably were those that like the fourth revision were related to the ongoing debate in international health research. The discussions&lt;ref name=Christie/&gt; indicate that there was felt a need to send a strong signal that exploitation of poor populations as a means to an end, by research from which they would not benefit, was unacceptable. In this sense the Declaration endorsed ethical universalism.

Article 29 restates the use of placebo where 'no proven' intervention exists. Surprisingly, although the wording was virtually unchanged, this created far more protest in this revision. The implication being that placebos are not permitted where proven interventions are available. The placebo question was already an active debate prior to the fourth revision but had intensified, while at the same time the placebo question was still causing controversy in the international setting. This revision implies that in choosing a study design, developed-world standards of care should apply to any research conducted on human subjects, including those in developing countries. The wording of the fourth and fifth revisions reflect the position taken by Rothman and Michel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rothman KJ, Michels KB |title=The continuing unethical use of placebo controls |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=331 |issue=6 |pages=394–8 |date=August 1994 |pmid=8028622 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199408113310611|last2=Michels }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Freedman et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1748-720X.1996.tb01859.x |author=Freedman B, Weijer C, Glass KC |title=Placebo orthodoxy in clinical research.

The opposing view, as expressed by Levine&lt;ref name="Levine 1999"/&gt; and by Temple and Ellenberg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Temple |first1=R |last2=Ellenberg |first2=SS |title=Placebo-controlled trials and active-control trials in the evaluation of new treatments. Part 1: ethical and scientific issues |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=133 |issue=6 |pages=455–63 |year=2000 |pmid=10975964 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-133-6-200009190-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is referred to as 'placebo orthodoxy', insisting that placebo controls are more scientifically efficient and are justifiable where the risk of harm is low. This viewpoint argues that where no standards of care exist, as for instance in developing countries, then placebo-controlled trials are appropriate. The utilitarian argument&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00998543 |author=Elander G, Hermerén G |title=Placebo effect and randomized clinical trials |journal=Theoretical Medicine |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=171–82 |date=June 1995 |pmid=7570396|last2=Hermerén }}&lt;/ref&gt; held that the disadvantage to a few (such as denial of potentially beneficial interventions) was justifiable for the advantage of many future patients. These arguments are intimately tied to the concept of [[distributive justice]], the equitable distribution of the burdens of research.&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Benatar | first1 = S. R. | title = Distributive justice and clinical trials in the Third World | journal = Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 169–176 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1023/A:1011419820440 | pmid =  11499493| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with much of the Declaration, there is room for interpretation of words. 'Best current' has been variously held to refer to either global or local contexts.&lt;ref name=Nuffield&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/fileLibrary/pdf/HRRDC_Follow-up_Discussion_Paper001.pdf|title=Nuffield Council on Bioethics: The ethics of research related to healthcare in developing countries. 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 30 introduced another new concept, that after the conclusion of the study patients 'should be assured of access to the best proven' intervention arising from the study, a justice issue. Arguments over this have dealt with whether subjects derive benefit from the trial and are no worse off at the end than the ''status quo'' prior to the trial, or of not participating, versus the harm of being denied access to that which they have contributed to. There are also operational issues that are unclear.

====Aftermath====
Given the lack of consensus on many issues prior to the fifth revision it is no surprise that the debates continued unabated.&lt;ref name=Macklin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/kennedy_institute_of_ethics_journal/v011/11.1macklin.html|title=Macklin R.

As Macklin&lt;ref name=Macklin/&gt; points out, both sides may be right, since justice "''is not an unambiguous concept''".

===Clarifications of Articles 29, 30 (2002&amp;ndash;2004)===
Eventually Notes of Clarification (footnotes) to articles 29 and 30 were added in 2002 and 2004 respectively, predominantly under pressure from the US (CMAJ 2003, Blackmer 2005). The 2002 clarification to Article 29 was in response to many concerns about WMA's apparent position on placebos. As WMA states in the note, there appeared to be 'diverse interpretations and possibly confusion'. It then outlined circumstances in which a placebo might be 'ethically acceptable', namely 'compelling... methodological reasons', ''or'' 'minor conditions' where the 'risk of serious or irreversible harm' was considered low. Effectively this shifted the WMA position to what has been considered a 'middle ground'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Emanuel |first1=Ezekiel J. |last2=Miller |first2=Franklin G. |title=The Ethics of Placebo-Controlled Trials — A Middle Ground |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=345 |issue=12 |pages=915–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11565527 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200109203451211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huston |first1=Patricia |last2=Peterson |first2=Robert |title=Withholding Proven Treatment in Clinical Research |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=345 |issue=12 |pages=912–4 |year=2001 |pmid=11565526 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200109203451210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the previous lack of consensus, this merely shifted the ground of debate, 
&lt;ref name="Macklin"/&gt; which now extended to the use of the 'or' connector. For this reason the footnote indicates that the wording must be interpreted in the light of all the other principles of the Declaration.

Article 30 was debated further at the 2003 meeting, with another proposed clarification&lt;ref name="CMAJ 2003"/&gt; but did not result in any convergence of thought, and so decisions were postponed for another year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wma.net/e/publications/pdf/wmj1.pdf|title=WMA - The World Medical Association-Hello world!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wma.net/e/press/2003_19.htm|title=WMA Press Release: WMA to continue discussion on Declaration of Helsinki. 14 September 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but again a commitment was made to protecting the vulnerable. A new working group examined article 30, and recommended not amending it in January 2004.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wma.net/e/ethicsunit/pdf/wg_doh_jan2004.pdf|title=Workgroup report on the revision of paragraph 30 of the Declaration of Helsinki 5 January 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Later that year the American Medical Association proposed a further note of clarification that was incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blackmer |first1=J. |last2=Haddad |first2=H |title=The Declaration of Helsinki: an update on paragraph 30 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=173 |issue=9 |pages=1052–3 |year=2005 |pmid=16247102 |pmc=1266330 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.045280}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this clarification the issue of post trial care now became something to consider, not an absolute assurance.

Despite these changes, as Macklin predicted, consensus was no closer and the Declaration was considered by some to be out of touch with contemporary thinking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lie |first1=R K |last2=Emanuel |first2=E |last3=Grady |first3=C |last4=Wendler |first4=D |title=The standard of care debate: the Declaration of Helsinki versus the international consensus opinion |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=190–3 |year=2004 |pmid=15082816 |pmc=1733825 |doi=10.1136/jme.2003.006031}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even the question of the future of the Declaration became a matter for conjecture.&lt;ref name=Wolinsky&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolinsky |first1=Howard |title=The battle of Helsinki: Two troublesome paragraphs in the Declaration of Helsinki are causing a furore over medical research ethics |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=670–2 |year=2006 |pmid=16819460 |pmc=1500825 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sixth revision (2008)===
The sixth revision cycle commenced in May 2007. This consisted of a call for submissions, completed in August 2007. The terms of reference included only a limited revision compared to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wma.net/e/ethicsunit/helsinki.htm|title=WMA Ethics Unit Invitation of Submissions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007 a draft revision was issued for consultation till February 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Harald |last1=Schmidt |first2=Annette |last2=Schulz-Baldes |date=November 28, 2007 |title=The 2007 Draft Declaration of Helsinki - Plus ça Change...? |url=http://www.thehastingscenter.org/Bioethicsforum/Post.aspx?id=666 |work=Bioethics Forum |publisher=[[Hastings Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to a workshop in Helsinki in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/files/ethics/DoH%20Review%20Consultation%20Draft-Nov2007|title=Draft revision Nov 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those comments were then incorporated into a second draft in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Research%20ethics/DoH%20Review%20Consultation%20Draft-May2008.doc|title=Second draft revision May 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Williams J | title = The Declaration of Helsinki and public health | url = http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/8/08-050955/en/index.html | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 86 | issue = 8| year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further workshops were held in [[Cairo]] and [[São Paulo]] and the comments collated in August 2008. A final text was then developed by the Working Group for consideration by the Ethics Committee and finally the General Assembly, which approved it on October 18. Public debate was relatively slight compared to previous cycles, and in general supportive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://216.147.199.31/PDF/APPI-Endorses-Helsinki-Updates.pdf  APPI endorses proposed updates to Declaration of Helsinki APPI 22 July 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Input was received from a wide number of sources, some of which have been published, such as [[Feminist Approaches to Bioethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1= Eckenwiler | first1= Lisa | last2= Feinholz | first2= Dafna | last3= Ells | first3= Carolyn | last4= Schonfeld | first4= Toby  |title=The Declaration of Helsinki through a feminist lens | journal = [[International Journal of Feminist Approaches to Bioethics]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 161–177 | doi = 10.2307/40339217 | date = Spring 2008 | jstor=40339217 | ref = harv | doi-broken-date= 2018-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others include [[CIOMS]] and the US Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goodyear MD, Eckenwiler LA, Ells C |title=Fresh thinking about the Declaration of Helsinki |journal=BMJ |volume=337 |issue= |pages=a2128 |year=2008 |pmid=18930967 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a2128|last2=Eckenwiler |last3=Ells }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seventh revision (2013)===

The most recent iteration of Helsinki (2013) was reflective of the controversy regarding the standard of care that arose from the vertical transmission trials. The revised declaration of 2013 also highlights the need to disseminate research results, including negative and inconclusive studies and also includes a requirement for treatment and compensation for injuries related to research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki: Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects |journal=JAMA |volume=310 |issue=20 |pages=2191–2194 |year=2013|pmid=24141714|doi=10.1001/jama.2013.281053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the updated version is felt to be more relevant to limited resource settings—specifically addressing the need to ensure access to an intervention if it is proven effective.

==Future==
The controversies and national divisions over the text have continued. The US FDA rejected the 2000 and subsequent revisions, only  recognizing the third (1989) revision,&lt;ref name=Wolinsky/&gt; and in 2006 announced it would eliminate all reference to the Declaration. After consultation, which included expressions of concern,
&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
a final rule was issued on April 28, 2008 replacing the Declaration of Helsinki with [[Good clinical practice|Good Clinical Practice]] effective October 2008.

While the Declaration has been a central document guiding research practice, its future has been called into question. Challenges include the apparent conflict between guides, such as the CIOMS and Nuffield Council documents. Another is whether it should concentrate on basic principles as opposed to being more prescriptive, and hence controversial. It has continually grown and faced more frequent revisions.&lt;ref name=Carlson/&gt; The recent controversies undermine the authority of the document, as does the apparent desertion by major bodies, and any rewording must embrace deeply and widely held values, since continual shifts in the text do not imply authority. The actual claims to authority particularly on a global level, by the insertion of the word "international" in article 10 has been challenged.

Carlson raises the question as to whether the document's utility should be more formally evaluated, rather than just relying on tradition.

In [[logic]], '''defeasible reasoning''' is a kind of [[reasoning]] that is rationally compelling, though not [[deductive reasoning|deductively valid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-defeasible | title="Defeasbile Reasoning," ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=1 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Defeasible reasoning is a particular kind of non-demonstrative reasoning, where the reasoning does not produce a full, complete, or final demonstration of a claim, i.e., where fallibility and corrigibility of a conclusion are acknowledged. In other words, defeasible reasoning produces a [[Wiktionary:contingent|contingent]] statement or claim.  Other kinds of non-demonstrative reasoning are [[probabilistic reasoning]], [[inductive reasoning]], [[statistical]] reasoning, [[abductive reasoning]], and [[paraconsistent]] reasoning.  Defeasible reasoning is also a kind of [[ampliative]] reasoning because its conclusions reach beyond the pure meanings of the premises.

The differences between these kinds of reasoning correspond to differences about the conditional that each kind of reasoning uses, and on what premise (or on what authority) the conditional is adopted:
* ''[[deductive reasoning|Deductive]]'' (from meaning postulate, axiom, or contingent assertion): if ''p'' then ''q'' (i.e., ''q'' or ''not-p'')
* ''Defeasible'' (from authority): if ''p'' then (defeasibly) ''q''
* ''[[Probabilistic logic|Probabilistic]]'' (from combinatorics and indifference): if ''p'' then (probably) ''q''
* ''[[Statistics|Statistical]]'' (from data and presumption):  the frequency of ''q''s among ''p''s is high (or inference from a model fit to data); hence, (in the right context) if ''p'' then (probably) ''q''
* ''[[inductive reasoning|Inductive]]'' (theory formation; from data, coherence, simplicity, and confirmation): (inducibly) "if ''p'' then ''q''"; hence, if ''p'' then (deducibly-but-revisably) ''q''
* ''[[abductive reasoning|Abductive]]'' (from data and theory):  ''p'' and ''q'' are correlated, and ''q'' is sufficient for ''p''; hence, if ''p'' then (abducibly) ''q'' as cause

Defeasible reasoning finds its fullest expression in [[jurisprudence]], [[ethics]] and [[moral philosophy]], [[epistemology]], [[pragmatics]] and conversational [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] in [[linguistics]], [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] [[Decision theory|decision theories]], and in [[knowledge representation]] and [[planning]] in [[artificial intelligence]].  It is also closely identified with [[prima facie]] (presumptive) reasoning (i.e., reasoning on the "face" of evidence), and [[ceteris paribus]] (default) reasoning (i.e., reasoning, all things "being equal").

== History ==

Though [[Aristotle]] differentiated the forms of reasoning that are valid for [[logic]] and [[philosophy]] from the more general ones that are used in everyday life (see [[dialectics]] and [[rhetoric]]), 20th century philosophers mainly concentrated on deductive reasoning. At the end of the 19th century, logic texts would typically survey both demonstrative and non-demonstrative reasoning, often giving more space to the latter. However, after the blossoming of [[mathematical logic]] at the hands of [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Willard van Orman Quine]], latter-20th century logic texts paid little attention to the non-deductive modes of inference.

There are several notable exceptions. [[John Maynard Keynes]] wrote his dissertation on non-demonstrative reasoning, and influenced the thinking of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] on this subject. Wittgenstein, in turn, had many admirers, including the [[positivist]] legal scholar [[H.L.A. Hart]] and the [[speech act]] linguist [[John L. Austin]], [[Stephen Toulmin]] and [[Chaim Perelman]] in rhetoric, the moral theorists [[W.D. Ross]] and [[C.L. Stevenson]], and the [[vagueness]] epistemologist/ontologist [[Friedrich Waismann]].

The etymology of ''defeasible'' usually refers to Middle English law of contracts, where a condition of defeasance is a clause that can invalidate or annul a contract or deed. Though ''defeat'', ''dominate'', ''defer'', ''defy'', ''deprecate'' and ''derogate'' are often used in the same contexts as ''defease,'' the verbs ''annul'' and ''invalidate'' (and ''nullify,'' ''overturn,'' ''rescind,'' ''vacate,'' ''repeal,'' ''debar'', ''void'', ''cancel'', ''countermand'', ''preempt'', etc.) are more properly correlated with the concept of defeasibility than those words beginning with the letter ''d''. Many dictionaries do contain the verb, ''to defease'' with past participle, ''defeased.''

Philosophers in moral theory and rhetoric had taken defeasibility largely for granted when American epistemologists rediscovered Wittgenstein's thinking on the subject: John Ladd, [[Roderick Chisholm]], [[Roderick Firth]], [[Ernest Sosa]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[John L. Pollock]] all began writing with new conviction about how ''appearance as red'' was only a defeasible reason for believing something to be red.  More importantly Wittgenstein's orientation toward [[language-games]] (and away from [[semantics]]) emboldened these epistemologists to manage rather than to expurgate ''prima facie'' logical inconsistency.

At the same time (in the mid-1960s), two more students of Hart and Austin at Oxford, [[Brian Barry]] and [[David Gauthier]], were applying defeasible reasoning to political argument and practical reasoning (of action), respectively. [[Joel Feinberg]] and [[Joseph Raz]] were beginning to produce equally mature works in ethics and jurisprudence informed by defeasibility.

By far the most significant works on defeasibility by the mid-1970s were in epistemology, where [[John L. Pollock|John Pollock]]'s 1974 ''Knowledge and Justification'' popularized his terminology of ''undercutting'' and ''rebutting'' (which mirrored the analysis of Toulmin). Pollock's work was significant precisely because it brought defeasibility so close to philosophical logicians. The failure of logicians to dismiss defeasibility in epistemology (as Cambridge's logicians had done to Hart decades earlier) landed defeasible reasoning in the philosophical mainstream.

Defeasibility had always been closely related to argument, rhetoric, and law, except in epistemology, where the chains of reasons, and the origin of reasons, were not often discussed. [[Nicholas Rescher]]'s ''Dialectics'' is an example of how difficult it was for philosophers to contemplate more complex systems of defeasible reasoning. This was in part because proponents of [[informal logic]] became the keepers of argument and rhetoric while insisting that formalism was anathema to argument.

About this time, researchers in [[artificial intelligence]] became interested in [[non-monotonic reasoning]] and its [[semantics]]. With philosophers such as Pollock and Donald Nute (e.g., [[defeasible logic]]), dozens of computer scientists and logicians produced complex systems of defeasible reasoning between 1980 and 2000. No single system of defeasible reasoning would emerge in the same way that Quine's system of logic became a de facto standard. Nevertheless, the 100-year headstart on non-demonstrative logical calculi, due to [[George Boole]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], and [[Gottlob Frege]] was being closed: both demonstrative and non-demonstrative reasoning now have formal calculi.

There are related (and slightly competing) systems of reasoning that are newer than systems of defeasible reasoning, e.g., [[belief revision]] and [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]]. The dialogue logics of [[Charles Leonard Hamblin|Charles Hamblin]] and Jim Mackenzie, and their colleagues, can also be tied closely to defeasible reasoning. Belief revision is a non-constructive specification of the desiderata with which, or constraints according to which, epistemic change takes place. Dynamic logic is related mainly because, like paraconsistent logic, the reordering of premises can change the set of justified conclusions. Dialogue logics introduce an adversary, but are like belief revision theories in their adherence to deductively consistent states of belief.

==Political and judicial use==
Many political philosophers have been fond of the word ''indefeasible'' when referring to rights, e.g., that were ''inalienable,'' ''divine,'' or ''indubitable.''  For example, in the 1776 [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], "community hath an indubitable, inalienable, and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish government..." (also attributed to [[James Madison]]); and [[John Adams]], "The people have a right, an indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge – I mean of the character and conduct of their rulers."
Also, [[Lord Aberdeen]]:  "indefeasible right inherent in the British Crown" and [[Gouverneur Morris]]:  "the Basis of our own Constitution is the indefeasible Right of the People."  Scholarship about [[Abraham Lincoln]] often cites these passages in the justification of secession.  Philosophers who use the word ''defeasible'' have historically had different world views from those who use the word ''indefeasible'' (and this distinction has often been mirrored by Oxford and Cambridge zeitgeist); hence it is rare to find authors who use both words.

In judicial opinions, the use of ''defeasible'' is commonplace.  There is however disagreement among legal logicians whether ''defeasible reasoning'' is central, e.g., in the consideration of ''open texture'', [[precedent]], [[wikt:exception|exceptions]], and ''rationales'', or whether it applies only to explicit defeasance clauses.  [[H.L.A. Hart]] in ''[[The Concept of Law]]'' gives two famous examples of defeasibility:  "No vehicles in the park" (except during parades); and "Offer, acceptance, and memorandum produce a contract" (except when the contract is illegal, the parties are minors, inebriated, or incapacitated, etc.).

== Specificity ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
One of the main disputes among those who produce systems of defeasible reasoning is the status of a ''rule of specificity.''  In its simplest form, it is the same rule as subclass [[inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] preempting class inheritance:

  (R1) if ''r'' then (defeasibly) ''q''                  e.g., if bird, then can fly
  (R2) if ''p'' then (defeasibly) ''not-q''              e.g., if penguin, then cannot fly
  (O1) if ''p'' then (deductively) ''r''                 e.g., if penguin, then bird
  (M1) arguably, p                               e.g., arguably, penguin
  (M2) R2 is a more specific reason than R1      e.g., R2 is better than R1
  (M3) therefore, arguably, not-q                e.g., therefore, arguably, not-flies

Approximately half of the systems of defeasible reasoning discussed today adopt a rule of specificity, while half expect that such ''preference'' rules be written explicitly by whoever provides the defeasible reasons.  For example, Rescher's dialectical system uses specificity, as do early systems of multiple inheritance (e.g., [[David Touretzky]]) and the early argument systems of Donald Nute and of [[Guillermo Simari]] and [[Ronald Loui]].  Defeasible reasoning accounts of  precedent ([[stare decisis]] and [[case-based reasoning]]) also make use of specificity (e.g., [[Joseph Raz]] and the work of Kevin D. Ashley and Edwina Rissland).  Meanwhile, the argument systems of Henry Prakken and Giovanni Sartor, of Bart Verheij and Jaap Hage, and the system of Phan Minh Dung do not adopt such a rule.

== Nature of defeasibility ==

There is a distinct difference between those who theorize about defeasible reasoning as if it were a system of confirmational revision (with affinities to [[belief revision]]), and those who theorize about defeasibility as if it were the result of further (non-empirical) investigation.  There are at least three kinds of further non-empirical investigation:  progress in a lexical/syntactic process, progress in a computational process, and progress in an adversary or legal proceeding.

; Defeasibility as corrigibility : Here, a person learns something new that annuls a prior inference.  In this case, defeasible reasoning provides a constructive mechanism for belief revision, like a [[truth maintenance system]] as envisioned by Jon Doyle.

; Defeasibility as shorthand for preconditions : Here, the author of a set of rules or legislative code is writing rules with exceptions.  Sometimes a set of defeasible rules can be rewritten, with more cogency, with explicit (local) pre-conditions instead of (non-local) competing rules.  Many non-monotonic systems with [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed-point]] or [[preferential]] semantics fit this view.  However, sometimes the rules govern a process of argument (the last view on this list), so that they cannot be re-compiled into a set of deductive rules lest they lose their force in situations with incomplete knowledge or incomplete derivation of preconditions.

; Defeasibility as an [[anytime algorithm]] : Here, it is assumed that calculating arguments takes time, and at any given time, based on a subset of the potentially constructible arguments, a conclusion is defeasibly justified.  [[Isaac Levi]] has protested against this kind of defeasibility, but it is well-suited to the heuristic projects of, for example, [[Herbert A. Simon]].  On this view, the ''best move so far'' in a chess-playing program's analysis at a particular depth is a defeasibly justified conclusion.  This interpretation works with either the prior or the next semantical view.

; Defeasibility as a means of controlling an investigative or social process : Here, justification is the result of the right kind of procedure (e.g., a fair and efficient hearing), and defeasible reasoning provides impetus for pro and con responses to each other.  Defeasibility has to do with the alternation of verdict as locutions are made and cases presented, not the changing of a mind with respect to new (empirical) discovery.  Under this view, defeasible reasoning and defeasible argumentation refer to the same phenomenon.

'''Epiphenomenalism''' is a position on the [[mind–body problem]] which holds that physical and [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] events within the human body ([[Sensory nervous system|sense organs]], [[Neurotransmission|neural impulses]], and muscle contractions, for example) are causal with respect to mental events (thought, consciousness, and cognition). According to this view, subjective mental events are completely dependent for their existence on corresponding physical and biochemical events within the human body and themselves have no causal efficacy on physical events. The appearance that subjective mental states (such as [[intention]]s) influence physical events is merely an illusion. For instance, fear seems to make the heart beat faster, but according to epiphenomenalism the biochemical secretions of the brain and nervous system (such as [[adrenaline]])—not the experience of fear—is what raises the heartbeat.&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Walter|first=Sven|title=Epiphenomenalism|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/epipheno/#H2|work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=University of Bielefeld|accessdate=10 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923005826/http://www.iep.utm.edu/epipheno/#H2|archivedate=23 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because mental events are a kind of overflow that cannot cause anything physical, yet have non-physical properties, epiphenomenalism is viewed as a form of [[property dualism]].

==Development==
During the seventeenth century, [[Rene Descartes]] argued that animals are subject to mechanical laws of nature. He defended the idea of [[automatic behavior]], or the performance of actions without conscious thought. Descartes questioned how the immaterial mind and the material body can interact causally.&lt;ref name="Walter"/&gt; His interactionist model (1649) held that the body relates to the mind through the pineal gland.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=William|chapter=Epiphenomenalism|chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epiphenomenalism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=1 November 2013|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie|La Mettrie]], [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] all in their own way began this way of thinking. The idea that even if the animal were conscious nothing would be added to the production of behavior, even in animals of the human type, was first voiced by La Mettrie (1745), and then by [[Pierre Jean George Cabanis|Cabanis]] (1802), and was further explicated by [[Shadworth Hodgson|Hodgson]] (1870) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodgson|first=Shadworth|title=The Theory of Practice|year=1870|publisher=Longmans, Green, Reader, &amp; Dyer|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] (1874).&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, T. H. (1874). "On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History", ''The Fortnightly Review'', n.s.16:555-580. Reprinted in ''Method and Results: Essays by Thomas H. Huxley'' (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1898)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, S. 2006. "Where's the action?: Epiphenomenalism and the problem of free will". In W. Banks, S. Pockett, and S. Gallagher. ''Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? An Investigation of the Nature of Intuition'' (109-124). Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Henry Huxley agreed with Descartes that behavior is determined solely by physical mechanisms, but he also believed that humans enjoy an intelligent life. In 1874, Huxley argued that animals are [[Conscious automatism|conscious automata]] in the Presidential Address to the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. Huxley proposed that psychical changes are collateral products of physical changes. He termed the stream of consciousness an "epiphenomenon;" like the bell of a clock that has no role in keeping the time, consciousness has no role in determining behavior.&lt;ref name="Walter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;

Huxley defended [[automatic behavior|automatism]] by testing reflex actions, originally supported by Descartes. Huxley hypothesized that frogs that undergo lobotomy would swim when thrown into water, despite being unable to initiate actions. He argued that the ability to swim was solely dependent on the molecular change in the brain, concluding that consciousness is not necessary for reflex actions. According to epiphenomenalism, animals experience pain only as a result of [[neurophysiology]].&lt;ref name="Walter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;

In 1870, Huxley conducted a case study on a French soldier who had sustained a shot in the [[Franco-Prussian war|Franco-Prussian War]] that fractured his left parietal bone. Every few weeks the soldier would enter a trance-like state, smoking, dressing himself, and aiming his cane like a rifle all while being insensitive to pins, electric shocks, odorous substances, vinegar, noise, and certain light conditions. Huxley used this study to show that consciousness was not necessary to execute these purposeful actions, justifying the assumption that humans are insensible machines. Huxley's mechanistic attitude towards the body convinced him that the brain alone causes behavior.&lt;ref name="Walter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;

In the early 1900s [[behaviorism|scientific behaviorists]] such as [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[John B. Watson]], and [[B. F. Skinner]] began the attempt to uncover laws describing the relationship between stimuli and responses, without reference to inner mental phenomena. Instead of adopting a form of [[eliminative materialism|eliminativism]] or mental [[fictionalism]], positions that deny that inner mental phenomena exist, a behaviorist was able to adopt epiphenomenalism in order to allow for the existence of mind. [[George Santayana]] (1905) believed that all motion has merely physical causes.  Because consciousness is accessory to life and not essential to it, natural selection is responsible for ingraining tendencies to avoid certain contingencies without any conscious achievement involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Alwyn|title=Stairway to the Mind|year=1995|publisher=Copernicus|location=New York, New York|isbn=9780387943817|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s, scientific behaviourism met substantial difficulties and eventually gave way to the [[cognitive revolution]]. Participants in that revolution, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], reject epiphenomenalism and insist upon the efficacy of the mind. Fodor even speaks of "epiphobia"—fear that one is becoming an epiphenomenalist.

However, since the cognitive revolution, there have been several who have argued for a version of epiphenomenalism. In 1970, [[Keith Campbell (philosopher)|Keith Campbell]] proposed his "new epiphenomenalism", which states that the body produces a spiritual mind that does not act on the body. How the brain causes a spiritual mind, according to Campbell, is destined to remain beyond our understanding forever (see [[New Mysterianism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=David|title=Unsnarling the World-Knot|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=9781556357558|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[David Chalmers]] and [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] argued that claims about conscious states should be deduced a priori from claims about physical states alone. They offered that epiphenomenalism bridges, but does not close, the explanatory gap between the physical and the phenomenal realms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polger|first=Thomas|title=Natural Minds|year=2004|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262661966|pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; These more recent versions maintain that only the subjective, qualitative aspects of mental states are epiphenomenal. Imagine both Pierre and a robot eating a cupcake. Unlike the robot, Pierre is conscious of eating the cupcake while the behavior is under way. This subjective experience is often called a ''quale'' (plural [[qualia]]), and it describes the private "raw feel" or the subjective "[[Thomas Nagel|what-it-is-like]]" that is the inner accompaniment of many mental states. Thus, while Pierre and the robot are both doing the same thing, only Pierre has the inner conscious experience.

[[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] (1982), for example, once espoused the following view:

{{quote|I am what is sometimes known as a "qualia freak". I think that there are certain features of bodily sensations especially, but also of certain perceptual experiences, which no amount of purely physical information includes. Tell me everything physical there is to tell about what is going on in a living brain... you won't have told me about the hurtfulness of pains, the itchiness of itches, pangs of jealousy....&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 1982, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to epiphenomenalism, mental states like Pierre's pleasurable experience—or, at any rate, their distinctive qualia—are [[epiphenomenon|epiphenomena]]; they are side-effects or by-products of physical processes in the body. If Pierre takes a second bite, it is not caused by his pleasure from the first; If Pierre says, "That was good, so I will take another bite", his speech act is not caused by the preceding pleasure. The conscious experiences that accompany brain processes are causally impotent. The mind might simply be a byproduct of other properties such as brain size or pathway activation synchronicity, which are adaptive.

Some thinkers draw distinctions between different varieties of epiphenomenalism. In ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] distinguishes between a purely metaphysical sense of epiphenomenalism, in which the epiphenomenon has no causal impact at all, and Huxley's "steam whistle" epiphenomenalism, in which effects exist but are not functionally relevant.

==Arguments for==
A large body of neurophysiological data seems to support epiphenomenalism.  Some of the oldest such data is the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] or "readiness potential" in which electrical activity related to voluntary actions can be recorded up to two seconds before the subject is aware of making a decision to perform the action. More recently [[Benjamin Libet]] et al. (1979) have shown that it can take 0.5 seconds before a stimulus becomes part of conscious experience even though subjects can respond to the stimulus in reaction time tests within 200 milliseconds. The conclusions of this experiment have begun to receive some backlash and criticism, mainly by neuroscientists such as Peter Tse, who claim to show that the readiness potential has nothing to do with consciousness at all.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dartmouth.edu/~peter/pdf/63.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research on the Event Related Potential also shows that conscious experience does not occur until the late phase of the potential (P3 or later) that occurs 300 milliseconds or more after the event. In Bregman's [[Illusory continuity of tones|auditory continuity illusion]], where a pure tone is followed by broadband noise and the noise is followed by the same pure tone it seems as if the tone occurs throughout the period of noise. This also suggests a delay for processing data before conscious experience occurs. Popular science author [[Tor Nørretranders]] has called the delay the "[[user illusion]]", implying that we only have the illusion of conscious control, most actions being controlled automatically by non-conscious parts of the brain with the conscious mind relegated to the role of spectator.

The scientific data seem to support the idea that conscious experience is created by non-conscious processes in the brain (i.e., there is subliminal processing that becomes conscious experience). These results have been interpreted to suggest that people are capable of action before conscious experience of the decision to act occurs. Some argue that this supports epiphenomenalism, since it shows that the feeling of making a decision to act is actually an epiphenomenon; the action happens before the decision, so the decision did not cause the action to occur.
&lt;!-- Section removed. See discussion--&gt;

==Arguments against==
The most powerful argument against epiphenomenalism is that it is self-contradictory: if we have knowledge about epiphenomenalism, then our brains know about the existence of the mind, but if epiphenomenalism were correct, then our brains should not have any knowledge about the mind, because the mind does not affect anything physical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | first=William | last=Robinson | editor=Edward N. Zalta | year=2015 | title=Epiphenomenalism | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition = Fall 2015 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epiphenomenalism/#SelStu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some philosophers do not accept this as a rigorous refutation. For example, Victor Argonov states that epiphenomenalism is a questionable, but experimentally falsifiable theory. He argues that the personal mind is not the only source of knowledge about the existence of mind in the world. A creature (even a zombie) could have knowledge about mind and the mind-body problem by virtue of some innate knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Victor Argonov |title=Experimental Methods for Unraveling the Mind-body Problem: The Phenomenal Judgment Approach |journal=Journal of Mind and Behavior |volume=35 |year=2014 |pages=51–70 |url=http://philpapers.org/rec/ARGMAA-2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020014221/http://philpapers.org/rec/ARGMAA-2 |archivedate=2016-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The information about mind (and its problematic properties such as qualia) could have been, in principle, implicitly "written" in the material world since its creation. Epiphenomenalists can say that God created immaterial mind and a detailed "program" of material human behavior that makes it possible to speak about the mind–body problem. That version of epiphenomenalism seems highly exotic, but it cannot be excluded from consideration by pure theory. However, Argonov suggests that experiments could refute epiphenomenalism. In particular, epiphenomenalism could be refuted if neural correlates of consciousness can be found in the human brain, and it is proven that human speech about consciousness is caused by them.

Some philosophers, such as Dennett, reject both epiphenomenalism and the existence of qualia with the same charge that [[Gilbert Ryle]] leveled against a Cartesian "[[ghost in the machine]]", that they too are [[category mistake]]s. A quale or conscious experience would not belong to the category of objects of reference on this account, but rather to the category of ways of doing things.

[[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalists]] assert that mental states are well described by their overall role, their activity in relation to the organism as a whole. "This doctrine is rooted in Aristotle's conception of the soul, and has antecedents in Hobbes's conception of the mind as a 'calculating machine', but it has become fully articulated (and popularly endorsed) only in the last third of the 20th century."&lt;ref name="sep-functionalism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Janet |last=Levin |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2010 |title=Functionalism |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Summer 2010 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/functionalism/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In so far as it mediates stimulus and response, a mental [[Function (computer science)|function]] is analogous to a program that processes [[input/output]] in [[automata theory]]. In principle, [[multiple realisability]] would guarantee [[Universal Turing machine|platform dependencies]] can be avoided, whether in terms of hardware and operating system or, ''ex hypothesi'', biology and philosophy. Because a [[high-level language]] is a practical requirement for developing the most complex programs, functionalism implies that a [[non-reductive physicalism]] would offer a similar advantage over a strictly eliminative materialism.

[[Eliminative materialism|Eliminative materialists]] believe "[[folk psychology]]" is so unscientific that, ultimately, it will be better to eliminate primitive concepts such as ''mind,'' ''desire'' and ''belief,'' in favor of a future neuro-scientific account. A more moderate position such as [[J. L. Mackie]]'s ''error theory'' suggests that false beliefs should be stripped away from a mental concept without eliminating the concept itself, the legitimate core meaning being left intact.

[[Benjamin Libet]]'s results are quoted&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Wegner|Wegner D.]], 2002. The Illusion of Conscious Will. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a "conscious veto", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel. (2003) ''Freedom evolves''.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar criticism of Libet-style research has been made by neuroscientist Adina Roskies and cognitive theorists Tim Bayne and Alfred Mele.

Others have argued that data such as the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience and a conscious decision occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is "completely without any power… as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".&lt;ref name="Flanagan1992"&gt;{{cite book |first=O.J. |last=Flanagan |year=1992 |title=Consciousness Reconsidered |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56077-1 |lccn=lc92010057 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFOqQgAACAAJ |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adrian G. Guggisberg and Annaïs Mottaz have also challenged those findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3746176 | pmid=23966921 | doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00385 | volume=7 | title=Timing and awareness of movement decisions: does consciousness really come too late? | year=2013 | journal=Front Hum Neurosci | pages=385 | last1 = Guggisberg | first1 = AG | last2 = Mottaz | first2 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Aaron Schurger and colleagues published in PNAS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/42/E2904/1|title=An accumulator model for spontaneous neural activity prior to self-initiated movement|first1=Aaron|last1=Schurger|first2=Jacobo D.|last2=Sitt|first3=Stanislas|last3=Dehaene|date=16 October 2012|publisher=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=109|issue=42|pages=16776–16777|accessdate=9 May 2018|via=www.pnas.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030042023/http://www.pnas.org/content/109/42/E2904/1|archivedate=30 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenged assumptions about the causal nature of the readiness potential itself (and the "pre-movement buildup" of neural activity in general), thus denying the conclusions drawn from studies such as Libet's&lt;ref name="LGW"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/brain/106.3.623 |title=Time of Conscious Intention to Act in Relation to Onset of Cerebral Activity (Readiness-Potential) |year=1983 |last1=Libet |first1=Benjamin |last2=Gleason |first2=Curtis A. |last3=Wright |first3=Elwood W. |last4=Pearl |first4=Dennis K. |journal=Brain |volume=106 |issue=3 |pages=623–42 |pmid=6640273}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fried's.&lt;ref name=Fried&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2010.11.045 |title=Internally Generated Preactivation of Single Neurons in Human Medial Frontal Cortex Predicts Volition |year=2011 |last1=Fried |first1=Itzhak |last2=Mukamel |first2=Roy |last3=Kreiman |first3=Gabriel |journal=Neuron |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=548–62 |pmid=21315264 |pmc=3052770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In favor of interactionism, [[Celia Green]] (2003) argues that epiphenomenalism does not even provide a satisfactory 'out' from the problem of interaction posed by substance dualism. Although it does not entail substance dualism, according to Green, epiphenomenalism implies a one-way form of interactionism that is just as hard to conceive of as the two-way form embodied in substance dualism. Green suggests the assumption that it is less of a problem may arise from the unexamined belief that physical events have some sort of primacy over mental ones.

[[Donald Symons]] dismisses epiphenomenalism from an evolutionary perspective. He says that the view that mind is an epiphenomenon of brain activity is not consistent with evolutionary theory, because if mind were functionless, it would have disappeared long ago, as it would not have been favoured by evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Symons, Donald. The evolution of human sexuality. Oxford University Press. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Court of Chancery edited.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Court of Chancery]], [[London]], in the early 19th century]]

In jurisdictions following the [[English law|English]] [[Common law#History|common law system]], '''equity''' is the body of law which was developed in the English [[Court of Chancery]] and which is now administered concurrently with the [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;'Common law' here is used in its narrow sense, referring to that body of law principally developed in the superior courts of common law: [[Court of King's Bench (England)|King's Bench]] and [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Pleas]].&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of its history, the English common law was principally developed and administered in the central royal courts: the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]], the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], and the [[Exchequer of Pleas|Exchequer]]. Equity was the name given to the law which was administered in the [[Court of Chancery]]. The [[Judicature Acts|Judicature Reforms]] in the 1870s effected a procedural fusion of the two bodies of law, ending their institutional separation. The reforms did not effect any substantive fusion, however. Judicial or academic reasoning which assumes the contrary has been described as a "fusion fallacy".&lt;ref name="MGL"&gt;{{cite book | first1=JD | last1=Heydon | first2=MJ | last2=Leeming | first3=PG | last3=Turner | title=Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane's Equity: Doctrine and Remedies | publisher=LexisNexis | edition=5th | date=2014 | isbn=9780409332254 | series=Trusts, Wills and Probate Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdictions which have inherited the common law system differ in their current treatment of equity. Over the course of the twentieth century some common law systems began to place less emphasis on the historical or institutional origin of substantive legal rules. In England, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, equity remains a distinct body of law. Modern equity includes, among other things:&lt;ref name="MGL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first=John | editor-last=McGhee | title=Snell's Equity | publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell | edition=33rd | isbn=9780414051607 | date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{main|History of equity}}

=== Origins of the common law ===

After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] of England in the 11th century, royal justice came to be administered in three central courts: the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]], the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], and the [[Exchequer of Pleas|Exchequer]]. The common law developed in these royal courts. To commence litigation in these royal courts, it was necessary to fit one's claim within a [[form of action]]. The plaintiff would purchase a writ in the [[Chancery (medieval office)|Chancery]], the head of which was the [[Lord Chancellor]]. If the law provided no remedy (or no efficacious remedy), litigants could sometimes appeal directly to the King. Eventually, the King would delegate resolution of these petitions to the King's Council. These petitions were eventually delegated to the Lord Chancellor himself.

In the early history of the United States, common law was viewed as a birthright. Both the individual states and the federal government supported common law after the American Revolution. U.S. courts draw on decisions of English courts, individual state courts, and federal courts in formulating common law.&lt;ref name="commonlaw.uslegal.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://commonlaw.uslegal.com/origins-of-common-law/ |title=The Origins of Common Law |publisher=US Legal, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emergence of the Court of Chancery ===

By the 14th century it appears that Chancery was operating as a court, affording remedies for which the strict procedures of the common law worked injustice or provided no remedy to a deserving plaintiff. Chancellors often had theological and clerical training and were well versed in [[Roman law]] and [[canon law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Sarah | last=Worthington | title=Equity | series=Clarendon Law Series | edition=2nd | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=12 October 2006 | isbn=0199290504 | pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 15th century the judicial power of Chancery was clearly recognised. Equity, as a body of rules, varied from Chancellor to Chancellor, until the end of the 16th century. After the end of the 17th century, only lawyers were appointed to the office of Chancellor. Over time, Equity developed a system of precedent much like its common-law cousin.

One area in which the Court of Chancery assumed a vital role was the enforcement of [[use (legal)|use]]s, a role that the rigid framework of [[English property law#Estates|land law]] could not accommodate. This role gave rise to the basic distinction between [[legal interest|legal]]{{disambiguation needed|date=July 2017}} and [[equitable interest]]s.

=== Development of equity in England ===

It was early provided that, in seeking to remove one who wrongfully entered another's land with force and arms, a person could allege disseisin (dispossession) and demand (and pay for) a [[Form of action|writ of entry]]. That writ gave him the written right to re-enter his own land and established this right under the protection of [[the Crown]] if need be, whence its value. In 1253, to prevent judges from inventing new writs, [[Parliament]] provided that the power to issue writs would thereafter be transferred to judges only one writ at a time, in a "writ for right" package known as a form of action.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} However, because it was limited to enumerated writs for enumerated rights and wrongs, the writ system sometimes produced unjust results. Thus, even though the King's Bench might have jurisdiction over a case and might have the power to issue the perfect writ, the plaintiff might still not have a case if there was not a single form of action combining them. Therefore, lacking a legal remedy, the plaintiff's only option would be petitioning the King.

People began petitioning the King for relief against unfair judgments, and as the number of petitioners rapidly grew, so the King delegated the task of hearing petitions to the Lord Chancellor. As the early Chancellors lacked formal legal training and showed little regard for precedent, their decisions were often widely diverse. In 1529, a lawyer, Sir [[Thomas More]], was appointed as Chancellor, marking the beginning of a new era. After this time, all future Chancellors were lawyers. Beginning around 1557, records of proceedings in the Courts of Chancery were kept and several equitable doctrines developed. Criticisms continued, the most famous being 17th-century jurist [[John Selden]]'s aphorism:&lt;blockquote&gt;Equity is a roguish thing: for law we have a measure, know what to trust to; equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is larger or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure we call a foot, a Chancellor's foot; what an uncertain measure would this be? One Chancellor has a long foot, another a short foot, a third an indifferent foot: 'tis the same thing in a Chancellor's conscience.&lt;ref&gt;J. Selden, ''Table Talk''; quoted in {{cite book | editor-first1=Michael | editor-last1=Evans | editor-first2=R Ian | editor-last2=Jack | title=Sources of English Legal and Constitutional History | publisher=Butterworths | location=Sydney | date=1984 | pages=223–224 | isbn=0409493821 | mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A criticism of Chancery practice as it developed in the early medieval period was that it lacked fixed rules and that the [[Lord Chancellor]] was exercising an unbounded discretion. The counter-argument was that Equity mitigated the rigour of the common law by looking to substance rather than to form.

Litigants would go '[[jurisdiction shopping]]' and often would seek an equitable [[injunction]] prohibiting the enforcement of a common law court order. The penalty for disobeying an equitable ‘common injunction’ and enforcing a common law judgment was imprisonment.

The Chief Justice of the [[King's Bench]], Sir [[Edward Coke]], began the practice of issuing writs of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' that required the release of people imprisoned for contempt of chancery orders.

This tension climaxed in the [[Earl of Oxford's case]] (1615) where a judgment of Chief Justice Coke was allegedly obtained by fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | litigants=Earl of Oxford's Case | court=Court of Chancery | date=1615 | reporter=I Ch Rep I, 21 ER 485}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord Chancellor, [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley|Lord Ellesmere]], issued a common injunction from the Chancery prohibiting the enforcement of the common law order. The two courts became locked in a stalemate, and the matter was eventually referred to the [[Attorney-General]], Sir [[Francis Bacon]]. Sir Francis, by authority of [[James I of England|King James I]], upheld the use of the common injunction and concluded that in the event of any conflict between the common law and equity, equity would prevail. Equity's primacy in England was later enshrined in the Judicature Acts of the 1870s, which also served to fuse the courts of equity and the common law (although emphatically not the systems themselves) into one unified court system.

=== Ecclesiastical laws ===
Ecclesiastical laws are a branch of English law and were English laws that dealt with matters concerning the church, this was so that religion and law was differentiated. These laws are considered an unwritten law of England and cannot be withheld in the court of law. Ecclesiastical laws are not currently established in the U.S as Common law.&lt;ref name="commonlaw.uslegal.com"/&gt;

=== Statute of Uses 1535 ===

In order to avoid paying land taxes and other feudal dues, lawyers developed a primitive form of trust called ‘the use’ that enabled one person (who was not required to pay tax) to hold the legal title of the land for the use of another person. The effect of this trust was that the first person owned the land under the common law, but the second person had a right to use the land under the law of equity.

Henry VIII enacted the [[Statute of Uses]] in 1535 (which became effective in 1536) in an attempt to outlaw this practice and recover lost revenue. The Act effectively made the beneficial owner of the land the legal owner and therefore liable for feudal dues.

The response of the lawyers to this Statute was to create the 'use upon a use'. The Statute recognized only the first use, and so land owners were again able to separate the legal and beneficial interests in their land.

For an example, see Godwyne v. Profyt (after 1393): a petition to the Chancellor&lt;ref&gt;''Godwyne v. Profyt'' in {{cite book | title=Select Cases in Chancery: A.D. 1364 to 1471 | publisher=Selden Society | editor-first=Baildon | editor-last=William Paley | url= https://archive.org/stream/selectcasesincha00grearich#page/48/mode/2up | at=case 45 (after 1393) | mode=cs2 | date=1896}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===

Equity remains a cornerstone of Australian private law. A string of cases in the 1980s saw the [[High Court of Australia]] re-affirm the continuing vitality of traditional equitable doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite AustLII | litigants=Muschinski v Dodds|HCA|78|1985|parallelcite=160 CLR 583}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court has recently affirmed the importance of Equity and dismissed the suggestion that [[unjust enrichment]] has explanatory power in relation to traditional equitable doctrines such as [[subrogation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII | litigants=Bofinger v Kingsway |HCA|44|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of [[New South Wales]] is particularly well known for the strength of its Equity jurisprudence. However, it was only in 1972 with the introduction of reform to the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) that empowered both the Equity and Common Law Division of the Supreme Court of NSW to grant relief in either equity or common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU |NSW|act|sca1970183|Supreme Court Act 1970|44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 NSW also adopted one of the essential sections of the Judicature reforms, which emphasised that where there was a conflict between the common law and equity, equity would always prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU |NSW|act|lraea1972263|Law Reform (Law and Equity) Act 1972|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 1984 three alumni of [[Sydney Law School]] and judges of the NSW Supreme Court, [[Roderick Meagher]], [[William Gummow]]  and John Lehane produced ''[[Equity: Doctrines and Remedies|Equity: Doctrines &amp; Remedies]]''. It remains one of the most highly regarded practitioner texts in Australia and England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants=Cukurova Finance International Ltd v Alfa Telecom Turkey Ltd | court=UKPC | num=20 | year=2013 | para=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII | litigants=Harris v Digital Pulse Pty Ltd |NSWCA|10|2003| parallelcite=56 NSWLR 298 | para=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is now in its 5th edition and edited by [[Dyson Heydon]], former Justice of the High Court, Justice Mark Leeming of the NSW Court of Appeal, and Dr Peter Turner of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].&lt;ref name="MGL"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===

==== England and Wales ====

Equity remains a distinct part of the [[English law|law]] of [[England and Wales]]. The main challenge to it has come from academic writers working within the [[English unjust enrichment law|law of unjust enrichment]]. Scholars such as [[Peter Birks|Professor Birks]] and [[Andrew Burrows|Professor Burrows]] argue that in many cases the inclusion of the label "legal" or "equitable" before a substantive rule is often unnecessary.&lt;ref name="Burrows"/&gt; Many English universities, such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], continue to teach Equity as a standalone subject. Leading practitioner texts include ''Snell's Equity'', ''Lewin on Trusts'', and ''Hayton &amp; Underhill's Law of Trusts and Trustees''.

==== Scotland ====

The [[courts of Scotland]] have never recognised a division between the normal [[common law]] and equity, and as such the [[Court of Session]] (the [[supreme court|supreme]] [[civil law (common law)|civil court]] of [[Scotland]]) has exercised an equitable and [[inherent jurisdiction]] and  called the ''nobile officium''.&lt;ref name="thomson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomson |first=Stephen |year=2015 |title=''The Nobile Officium: The Extraordinary Equitable Jurisdiction of the Supreme Courts of Scotland''| location=Edinburgh| publisher=Avizandum | isbn=1904968333}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''nobile officium'' enables the Court to provide a [[legal remedy]] where [[statute]] or the [[common law]] are silent, and prevent mistakes in procedure or practice that would lead to [[injustice]]. The exercise of this power is limited by adherence to [[precedent]], and when [[Primary and secondary legislation|legislation]] or the common law already specify the relevant remedy. Thus, the Court cannot set aside a [[statutory power]], but can deal with situations where the law is silent, or where there is an omission in statute. Such an omission is sometimes termed a ''casus improvisus''.&lt;ref name="nobile_officium"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobileofficium.com/nobile-officium-used-to-recognise-english-high-court-orders-due-to-statutory-casus-improvisus/|title=Nobile officium used to recognise English High Court orders due to statutory casus improvisus {{!}} The Nobile Officium|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:uwH8m1opGboJ:https://www.nobileofficium.com/nobile-officium-used-to-recognise-english-high-court-orders-due-to-statutory-casus-improvisus/+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk|archive-date=2 Apr 2017|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=J.

=== India ===

In [[India]] the [[common law]] doctrine of equity had traditionally been followed even after it became independent in 1947. However, in 1963 the [[Specific Relief Act 1963|"Specific Relief Act"]] was passed by the [[Parliament of India]] following the recommendation of the [[Law Commission of India]] and repealing the earlier "Specific Relief Act" of 1877. Under the 1963 Act, most equitable concepts were codified and made statutory rights, thereby ending the discretionary role of the courts to grant equitable reliefs. The rights codified under the 1963 Act were as under:
* Recovery of possession of immovable property (ss. 5–8)
* Specific performance of [[contract]]s (ss. 9–25)
* Rectification of Instruments (s. 26)
* Recession of Contracts (ss. 27–30)
* Cancellation of Instruments (ss. 31–33)
* Declaratory Decrees (ss. 34–35)
* [[Injunction]]s (ss. 36–42)

With this codification, the nature and tenure of the equitable reliefs available earlier have been modified to make them statutory rights and are also required to be pleaded specifically to be enforced. Further to the extent that these equitable reliefs have been codified into rights, they are no longer discretionary upon the courts or as the English law has it, "Chancellor's foot" but instead are enforceable rights subject to the conditions under the 1963 Act being satisfied. Nonetheless, in the event of situations not covered under the 1963 Act, the courts in India continue to exercise their [[Inherent Powers|inherent powers]] in terms of Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which applies to all [[civil court]]s in India.

There is no such inherent powers with the criminal courts in India except with the [[High Courts of India|High Courts]] in terms of Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Further, such inherent powers are vested in the [[Supreme Court of India]] in terms of Article 142 of the [[Constitution of India]] which confers wide powers on the Supreme Court to pass orders "as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause of matter pending before it".

=== United States ===

In modern practice, perhaps the most important distinction between law and equity is the set of remedies each offers. The most common civil remedy a court of law can award is monetary damages. Equity, however, enters injunctions or decrees directing someone either to act or to forbear from acting. Often, this form of relief is in practical terms more valuable to a litigant; for example, a plaintiff whose neighbor will not return his only milk cow, which had wandered onto the neighbor's property, may want that particular cow back, not just its monetary value. However, in general, a litigant cannot obtain equitable relief unless there is "no adequate remedy at law"; that is, a court will not grant an injunction unless monetary damages are an insufficient remedy for the injury in question. Law courts can also enter certain types of immediately enforceable orders, called "[[writ]]s" (such as a writ of [[habeas corpus]]), but they are less flexible and less easily obtained than an [[injunction]].

Another distinction is the unavailability of a jury in equity: the judge is the [[trier of fact]]. In the American legal system, the right of [[jury trial]] in civil cases tried in federal court is guaranteed by the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]] ''in Suits at common law'', cases that traditionally would have been handled by the law courts. The question of whether a case should be determined by a jury depends largely on the type of relief the plaintiff requests. If a plaintiff requests damages in the form of money or certain other forms of relief, such as the return of a specific item of property, the remedy is considered legal, and a jury is available as the fact-finder. On the other hand, if the plaintiff requests an [[injunction]], [[declaratory judgment]], [[specific performance]], modification of contract, or some other non-monetary relief, the claim would usually be one in equity.

[[Thomas Jefferson]] explained in 1785 that there are three main limitations on the power of a court of equity: "If the legislature means to enact an injustice, however palpable, the court of Chancery is not the body with whom a correcting power is lodged. That it shall not interpose in any case which does not come within a general description and admit of redress by a general and practicable rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter | url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-09-02-0056 | first=Thomas | last=Jefferson | recipient=Phillip Mazzei | subject=To Philip Mazzei | date=November 1785}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Supreme Court, however, has concluded that courts have wide discretion to fashion relief in cases of equity. The first major statement of this power came in ''[[Willard v. Tayloe]]'', 75 U.S. 557 (1869). The Court concluded that "relief is not a matter of absolute right to either party; it is a matter resting in the discretion of the court, to be exercised upon a consideration of all the circumstances of each particular case."&lt;ref name="Willard565"&gt;{{cite court | litigants=Willard v. Tayloe | date=1869 | reporter={{law report |75|U.S.|557}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Willard v.

In the United States today, the federal courts and most state courts have merged law and equity in the courts of general jurisdiction, such as county courts. However, the substantive distinction between law and equity has retained its old vitality.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite court | litigants=Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc. | reporter={{law report|547|US|356}} | year=2006}} (Roberts, C.J. for a unanimous court) (reviewing the scope of equitable relief as authorized by the ERISA statute).&lt;/ref&gt; This difference is not a mere technicality, because the successful handling of certain law cases is difficult or impossible unless a temporary restraining order (TRO) or preliminary injunction is issued at the outset, to restrain someone from fleeing the jurisdiction taking the only property available to satisfy a judgment, for instance. Furthermore, certain statutes like [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] specifically authorize ''only'' equitable relief, which forces US courts to analyze in lengthy detail whether the relief demanded in particular cases brought under those statutes would have been available in equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | litigants=Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson | reporter={{law report|534|US|204}} | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equity courts were widely distrusted in the northeastern US following the American Revolution. A serious movement for merger of law and equity began in the states in the mid-19th century, when [[David Dudley Field II]] convinced New York State to adopt what became known as the [[Field Code]] of 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Douglas | last=Laycock | title=Modern American Remedies: Cases and materials | edition=3rd | publisher=Aspen Press | year=2002 | page=370 | isbn=0735524696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Kellen | last=Funk | title=Equity without Chancery: The Fusion of Law and Equity in the Field Code of Civil Procedure, New York 1846–76 | journal=Journal of Legal History | date=2015 | pages=152–191 | doi=10.1080/01440365.2015.1047560 | volume=36 | issue=2 | ssrn=2600201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal courts did not abandon the old law/equity separation until the promulgation of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in 1938.

Today three states still have separate courts for law and equity; the most notable is [[Delaware]], whose [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]] is where most cases involving [[Delaware corporation]]s are decided.&lt;ref&gt;The other two are [[Courts of Mississippi|Mississippi]] and [[Courts of Tennessee|Tennessee]]. Sources that mention four states (i.e., Laycock 2002) generally include [[Courts of Arkansas|Arkansas]], which abolished its separate chancery courts as of January 1, 2002. {{cite web|url=http://courts.state.ar.us/circuitcourt/index.cfm |accessdate=July 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804025412/http://courts.state.ar.us/circuitcourt/index.cfm |archivedate=August 4, 2011 | title=Circuit Court | publisher=Arkansas Judiciary | mode=cs2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, merger in some states is less than complete; some other states (such as Illinois and [[New Jersey]]) have separate divisions for legal and equitable matters in a single court.  Virginia had separate law and equity dockets (in the same court) until 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, Rule 3:1; W.H. Bryson, "[https://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.bing.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1068&amp;context=law-faculty-publications The Merger of Common-Law and Equity Pleading in Virginia]", University of Richmond Law Review 41:77-82 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Besides [[corporate law]], which developed out of the [[Trust law|law of trusts]], areas traditionally handled by chancery courts included [[Will (law)|wills]] and [[probate]], [[adoption]]s and [[guardianship]]s, and [[marriage]] and [[divorce]]. [[Bankruptcy]] was also historically considered an equitable matter; although [[bankruptcy in the United States]] is today a purely federal matter, reserved entirely to the [[United States Bankruptcy Courts]] by the enactment of the [[United States Bankruptcy Code]] in 1978, bankruptcy courts are still officially considered "courts of equity" and exercise equitable powers under Section 105 of the Bankruptcy Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hawes|first1=Lesley Anne|title=Another Conflict in the Circuits Brewing Over Bankruptcy Court's Equitable Powers Under §105(a)|url=http://www.abfjournal.com/articles/another-conflict-in-the-circuits-brewing-over-bankruptcy-courts-equitable-powers-under-%C2%A7105a/|website=ABF Journal|accessdate=18 June 2015|date=January–February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After US courts merged law and equity, American law courts adopted many of the procedures of equity courts. The procedures in a court of equity were much more flexible than the courts at common law. In American practice, certain devices such as [[joinder]], [[counterclaim]], [[cross-claim]] and [[interpleader]] originated in the courts of equity. Also, the modern [[class action]] evolved out of the equitable doctrine of virtual representation, which enabled a court of equity to fully dispose of an estate even though it might contain contingent interests held by persons over which the court did not have direct jurisdiction.

'''Eugène Dupréel''' (February 8, 1879 – February 14, 1967) was a [[Belgian]] [[philosopher]]. He has been professor at the [[Université libre de Bruxelles]] from 1907 to 1950, teaching [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[greek philosophy]], [[Ethics|moral philosophy]] and [[sociological theory]]. He developed an ethical theory and a theory of knowledge deeply influenced by [[sociology]], and worked closely with the [[Solvay Institute of Sociology|Institut de Sociologie Solvay]]. Leader of the "École de Bruxelles", he had a major influence on the argumentation theorist [[Chaïm Perelman]] and thus has been instrumental in the renewal of [[rhetoric]].

An '''explanandum''' (a [[Latin]] term) is a sentence describing a [[phenomenon]] that is to be [[explanation|explained]], and the '''explanans''' are the sentences adduced as explanations of that phenomenon. For example, one person may pose an ''explanandum'' by asking "Why is there smoke?", and another may provide an ''explanans'' by responding "Because there is a fire". In this example, "smoke" is the ''explanandum'', and "fire" is the ''explanans''.

==In scientific method==
[[Carl Gustav Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim]] (1948),&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Hempel CG, Oppenheim P |year=1948 |title=Studies in the Logic of Explanation |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=XV |pages=135–175 |doi=10.1086/286983|citeseerx=10.1.1.294.3693 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in their [[deductive-nomological model]] of scientific explanation, motivated the distinction between explanans and explanandum in order to answer why-questions, rather than simply what-questions:

{{Quotation|"the event under discussion is explained by subsuming it under general laws, i.e., by showing that it occurred in accordance with those laws, by virtue of the realization of certain specified antecedent conditions"|Hempel &amp; Oppenheim, 1948|(p.152)&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"/&gt;}}

Specifically, they define the concepts as follows:

{{Quotation|"By the ''explanandum'', we understand the sentence describing the phenomenon to be explained (not that phenomenon itself); by the ''explanans'', the class of those sentences which are adduced to account for the phenomenon"|Hempel &amp; Oppenheim, 1948|(p.152)&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"/&gt;}}

The crucial comment, with respect to the scientific method, is given as follows:

{{Quotation|"It may be said... that an explanation is not fully adequate unless its explanans, if taken account of in time, could have served as a basis for predicting the phenomenon under consideration....  It is this potential predictive force which gives scientific explanation its importance: Only to the extent that we are able to explain empirical facts can we attain the major objective of scientific research, namely not merely to record the phenomena of our experience, but to learn from them, by basing upon them theoretical generalizations which enable us to anticipate new occurrences and to control, at least to some extent, the changes in our environment"|Hempel &amp; Oppenheim, 1948|(p.154)&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"/&gt;}}

==Related terms==
*''Explicandum'' {{mdash}} that which gets explicated
*''Explicans'' {{mdash}} that which gives the explication.

'''François-Xavier Bellamy''' (born 11 October 1985) is a French philosopher, award-winning author, high-school teacher and politician. He is a [[Mayor (France)#Deputy mayor|deputy mayor]] of [[Versailles]].

==Early life==
François-Xavier Bellamy was born on 11 October 1985.&lt;ref name="bnffrancoisxavierbellamy"&gt;{{cite web|title=François-Xavier Bellamy|url=http://data.bnf.fr/16918780/francois-xavier_bellamy/|website=Bibliothèque nationale de France|accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="academieversaillesbio"&gt;{{cite web|title=BELLAMY François-Xavier|url=http://academiedeversailles.com/detail.php?categorie_id=1&amp;scategorie_id=28&amp;contact_id=1461|website=Académie des Sciences Morales, des Lettres et des Arts de Versailles|accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellamy was educated at the Ecole Sainte-Marie des Bourdonnais, a private school in Versailles.&lt;ref name="ecoleconference"&gt;{{cite web|title=Conférence|url=http://www.saintemarie-versailles.fr/rubriques/haut/agenda/conference-2|website=Ecole Sainte-Marie des Bourdonnais|accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two-years [[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|preparatory classes]] in the [[Lycée Henri-IV]], he got into the [[Ecole normale supérieure]], from which he graduated in 2005.&lt;ref name="academieversaillesbio"/&gt; He earned the [[agrégation]] in philosophy in 2008.&lt;ref name="academieversaillesbio"/&gt;

==Career==
Bellamy taught philophy at the Lycée Sainte-Geneviève and the Lycée Notre-Dame de Grandchamp in Versailles in 2008.&lt;ref name="academieversaillesbio"/&gt; In 2009, he taught at the Lycée Auguste Renoir in [[Asnières-sur-Seine]], the Lycée Louis Bascan in [[Rambouillet]] and the Lycée hôtelier in [[Guyancourt]].&lt;ref name="academieversaillesbio"/&gt; Since 2011, he has been teaching philosophy and art history for the [[classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|preparatory classes]] at the Lycée Blomet in Paris.&lt;ref name="academieversaillesbio"/&gt;

Bellamy is the author of three books. He won the Prix d'Aumale from the [[Académie française]] in 2014 for his first book, ''Les déshérités ou l'urgence de transmettre''.&lt;ref name="leparisienleludeversaillesprimepour"&gt;{{cite news|title=L'élu de Versailles primé pour son livre " Les Déshérités "|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/versailles-78000/l-elu-de-versailles-prime-pour-son-livre-les-desherites-25-11-2015-5311585.php|accessdate=February 22, 2017|work=Le Parisien|date=November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this [[essay]], he analyses the failure of French educational system as the result of an ideology that refuses the transmission of culture, thus creating ''disinherited''. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[René Descartes]] and [[Pierre Bourdieu]] would be the utmost representatives of this ideology.

He is the [[Mayor (France)#Deputy mayor|deputy mayor]] of [[Versailles]] for employment, youth and higher education.&lt;ref name="academieversaillesbio"/&gt; He was a candidate for the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] elections in 2017, invested by [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]], but he lost in the second round against the candidate of [[En Marche!]], with 48.9% vs 51.1% of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;http://elections.interieur.gouv.fr/legislatives-2017/078/07801.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Books ===
In his book ''Mediations'' (1996), Kocijančič expressed his understanding of a contemporary [[Christian philosophy]] stemming from the idea of a radical apophatic thought. In his book ''Between the East and the West: Four Contributions to the Ecstatics'' (2004) he formulated his understanding of the relationship between different spiritual traditions and the [[metaontology]], [[gnoseology]], [[ethics]] and [[ecclesiology]] of the supraconfessional, Eastern-Western [[Christianity]]. His work ''To Those Outside: Exoteric Writings 1990-2003'' (2004), is a collection of short newspaper articles, columns and book reviews published in various journals and newspapers, in which he comments on current events, newly published books and artistic events from the perspective of his [[anarchy|anarchic]] philosophy of culture. For this work he received the [[Rožanc Award]] the same year it was published.

=== Translations ===
Kocijančič has translated into Slovene (and written upon) a [[Pre-Socratic]] verse composition from [[Ancient Greek]] by the poet and thinker [[Parmenides]] (''Parmenides: Fragments 1995'') and ''The Elements of Theology by [[Proclus]]'' (1999). He translated and commented upon complete works of [[Plato]] (2004). He has also worked on the ''New standard translation of the Bible into Slovene'' by providing translation of and commentary to the [[Gospel]]s and certain deuterocanonical books of [[Old Testament]] and the revision of the entire [[New Testament]], and translated and annotated numerous patristic works such as ''Thoughts of the Greek Fathers on Prayer'' (1993), ''The Wisdom of the Desert'' (1994), ''Apostolic Fathers'' (1996), ''[[Gregory of Nyssa]]: Life of Macrina, Dialogue On the Soul and Resurrection'' (1996), ''Logos in Defence of the Truth: Selected Writings by the Early Christian Apologists'' (1998), ''[[Maximus the Confessor]]: Selected Works'' (2000). His last work is translation of the complete works of ''[[Dionysius the Areopagite]]'' (2009) and [[Boethius]]’ ''Consolation of Philosophy'' (2012).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} With others he also edited and translated [[Meister Eckhart]]'s ''Sermons and Treatises'' (1996) and edited the translation of a series of books on history of medieval philosophy.

=== Poetry ===
His collection of [[poetry]] ''Your names'' (2000) was published [[bilingual]]ly with an [[English language|English]] translation. His other three collections are ''Thirty steps'' and ''We’re gone'' (2005), ''Certamen spirituale'' (2008) and ''[[Primož Trubar]] is leaving Ljubljana'' (2012). Many of his poems are translated in various languages and included in anthologies of Slovene poetry.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

== Other interests ==
His other interests include nineteenth-century [[thought]]; for example he translated [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|V. Solovyov]]'s ''Spiritual foundations of life'' (2000), and provided an introduction to it titled "The Subject and the Doctrine and contemporary currents of philosophical thought". He also translated [[Emmanuel Levinas|E. Lévinas]] ''Time and the Other'' (1998), and wrote an introduction to it with the title "Other time? Different Other? Phenomenology as a hermeneutical problem".{{original research inline|date=July 2013}}

Besides translating philosophical and [[theological]] texts and writing poetry, he has also been involved in literary translation. He has translated from [[Hebrew]] a selection of [[poem]]s by the most renowned Hebrew poets of the [[Middle Age]]s; [[Judah Halevi|Judah ben Samuel Halevi]]'s: ''Selected Poems'' (1998), [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]]'s ''Crown of the Kingdom'' (2011). From [[German language|German]] he has translated [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]]'s ''Marienleben und Stundenbuch'', and with [[Vid Snoj]] poems by [[Angelus Silesius]] and [[Paul Celan]].

'''Gregorio Marañón y Posadillo''', [[Order of the White Lion|OWL]] (19 May 1887 in [[Madrid]] – 27 March 1960 in Madrid) was a Spanish physician, scientist, historian, writer and philosopher. He married Dolores Moya in 1911, and they had four children (Carmen, Belén, María Isabel and Gregorio).

=== Life and work ===
An austere, humanist and liberal man, he is considered one of the most brilliant Spanish intellectuals of the 20th century. Besides his erudition, he also stands out for his elegant literary style. As many other thinkers of his time, he involved himself social and politically: he was a Republican and fought the Miguel Primo de Rivera dictatorship (he was condemned to jail for a month) and showed his disagreement with Spanish communism. Moreover, he supported the Spanish Second Republic in its beginnings but he later criticised it because of its lack of cohesion among the Spanish people.

Probably after going away from Madrid (around January 1937), and when asked his opinion of the republican Spain, Marañón spoke in a meeting of French intellectuals as follows: 
&lt;small&gt;You don't need to try very hard, my friends; listen to this: eighty-eight percent of teachers from Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona (the three universities which, alongside Murcia's, had stayed on the republican side) have been forced to exile abroad. And do you know why? Simply because they were afraid of being murdered by the reds (communists in Spain), despite many of the threatened intellectuals were thought of as left-wing men.&lt;/small&gt;

In the article "Liberalism and comunism", published in Revue de Paris on 15 December 1937, he clearly expressed his change of opinion towards the Second Republic:

&lt;small&gt;[...] In History there is one absolutely forbidden thing: to judge what could have happened if what happened hadn't happened. But what is beyond discussion is that the prophecies from the extreme right-wing or monarchic sides that opposed to the Republic were completely fulfilled: non-stop chaos, strikes with no motivation, burnings of churches, religious prosecution, taking away the power from the liberals, who had sponsored the movement and who didn't fall into classes politics; refusal to admit in normality to right-wing people who obeyed the regime in good faith, although they logically weren't ignited with republican extremism. The liberal heard these prophecies with suicide desdain. It would be an outrageous lie today to say otherwise. Many centuries of success in the governing of the people (some not extinguished yet, as the English and American democracies) had given to the liberal person an excessive, sometimes conceited confidence in his superiority. Almost all of the statues that, in the streets of America and Europe, sow the people the homage to the great men, have written on their plinths the name of a liberal. Whichever the political future of Spain may be, there is no doubt that in this stage of its history, it was the reactionary, and not the liberal, who got it right.&lt;/small&gt;

From December 1936 to autumn of 1942, Marañón lived abroad, in a de facto exile. Back in Spain again, the dictatorship (as it did with other intellectuals) used his figure to improve its exterior image. In overall terms, the franquism respected him. Miguel Artola, in 1987, stated that the biggest political contribution of Marañón was clearly having raised the flag of freedom, in a time where no one or only a few could do it, understanding liberalism as the opposite to a specific political position. In this sense, he would state: "Being liberal is, precisely, these two things: first, being open to understanding with those who think differently, and second, never admitting that the end justifies the means, but the other way around, the means justify the end." "Therefore, liberalism is a behaviour, and so, it is much more than politics". (Prologue of his book Liberal Essays, 1946).
After the students riot of 1956, he led, with Menéndez Pidal, the first manifests who denounced from inside the political situation and asked for the return of the exiled. 
His contribution to Medicine was early focused on endocrinology, as he was one of its forefathers. During his first year of graduate (1909) he published seven works in the Clinical Magazine of Madrid, of which only one was related to endocrinology, about the autoinmune polyendocrine syndrome. In 1910, he published five works, two of them related to endocrinology, about the Addison disease. In following years, his attraction to endocrinology only grew larger. In 1930 he published Endocrinology (Madrid: Espasa-calpe) and thirty more works in scientific journals on that speciality, of which half were works as the only author, which is remarkable taking into account the political-historical context in which Marañón was directly or indirectly involved. 
He wrote the first treatise of Internal Medicine in Spain, along with Doctor Hernando, and his book Manual of etiologic diagnostic (1946) was one of the most widespread medicine books in the world because of its new focus on the study of diseases and its endless and unprecedented clinical contributions.

Beyond his intense dedication to medicine, he wrote about almost everything: history, art, travels, cooking, clothing, hairstyle, shoes...But even if his contributions on the field of Medicine are untouchable, what makes his work eternal, universal and even more original is the discovering and description of the ethical, moral, religious, cultural, historical...side, the "human" side, that comes along it.
In his works he analysed, with a unique and unprecedented literary gender: "biological essay", the great human passions through historical characters, and their psychic and physiopathologic features: shyness in his book Amiel, resentment in Tiberio, power in The Count-Duke of Olivares, intrigue and treason in politics in Antonio Pérez (one of the makers of the Spanish "black legend"), the "donjuanismo" in Don Juan, etc.
He was inducted and collaborated in five of the eight Spanish Real Academies.

The blueprint of Marañón is, in the opinion of Ramón Menéndez Pidal, "indelible", on both the science domain and the relationships he built with his peers. Pedro Laín Entralgo recognised as far as five different personalities in this great doctor from Madrid: the doctor Marañón, the writer Marañón, the historian Marañón that greatly contributed to his "universality", the moralist Marañón and the Spanish Marañón. What makes his work even more singular is the multiplicity of profiles that he is involved in: the scientific, ethic, moral, religious, cultural, historic domains...that is, "human". He was a doctor for the Royal House, and for plenty of well-known people from the social life in Spain, but above it all he was a "beneficence doctor" (or of attention to the poorest people) at the Hospital Provincial de Madrid, nowadays called Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, where in 1911 was appointed at his own request in the unit of infectious diseases. Along with this hospital, the biggest one in Madrid, nowadays his name stands in the front of several streets and education institutions all over Spain.

=== Foundation ===
The Gregorio Marañón Foundation was established on 11 November 1988, with the aim of "perpetuate the thinking and work of Doctor Marañón, spread the high magistrature of Medicine he worked in and promote research in the fields of Medicine and Bioethics". Furthermore, "it is a cornerstone of the Foundation the localization and recuperation of all the biographic and bibliographic documents to constitute a Documentary Fund available to all the learners who want to analyse and go deeper into the signification and validity of the thinking and work of Gregorio Marañón". A Marañón Week is annually held since 1990.
The Marañón Week of 1999 was devoted to the topic of emotion, in 2000, held in Oviedo, was devoted to Benito Jerónimo Feijoo, in 2001, to the figure of don Juan, in 2002, held in the University Hospital Complex of Albacete, to the "Medical Work of Marañón", in 2006, held in Valencia, to "Luis Vives: Spanish humanist in Europe" and in 2009, to the "liberal tradition".
On 9 July 2010 the José Ortega y Gasset Foundation and the Gregorio Marañón Foundation fused, creating a sole organization: the José Ortega y Gasset-Gregorio Marañón Foundation, also known as the Ortega-Marañón Foundation. However, the website of the new foundation, which still stands as http://www.ortegaygasset.edu, barely reveals any activity or interest related to Marañón.

=== Ateneo of Madrid ===
It could be taken into consideration that it was not the Foundation, but the Ateneo of Madrid, who celebrated the 50th anniversary of the death of Marañón, on 19 October 2010. In 1924 Marañón "had been promoted to president of the Ateneo by acclamation of his partners, that viewed him as his true president, but his presidency was de facto because the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera did not allow the electoral session. After the factious assembly , not recognised by the associates, Marañón was appointed as president of the Ateneo in March of 1930."

==The first Waldorf schools==
In the chaotic circumstances of post-[[World War I]] Germany, [[Rudolf Steiner]] had been giving lectures on his ideas for a societal transformation in the direction of independence of the economic, governmental and cultural realms, known as [[Social Threefolding]], to the workers of various factories. On April 23, 1919, he held such a lecture for the workers of the Waldorf-Astoria cigarette factory in [[Stuttgart]], Germany; in this lecture he mentioned the need for a new kind of comprehensive school. On the following day, the workers approached [[Herbert Hahn]], one of Steiner's close co-workers, and asked him whether their children could be given such a school.  Independently of this request, the owner and managing director of the factory, [[Emil Molt]], announced his decision to set up such a school for his factory workers' children to the company's Board of Directors and asked Steiner to be the school's pedagogical consultant. The name ''Waldorf'' thus comes from the factory which hosted the first school.&lt;ref name=Hemleben&gt;Johannes Hemleben, ''Rudolf Steiner: A documentary biography'', Henry Goulden Ltd, {{ISBN|0-904822-02-8}}, pp. 121-126 (German edition Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag {{ISBN|3-499-50079-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Waldorf school was formed as an independent institution licensed by the local government as an exploratory model school with special freedoms. Steiner specified four conditions:

# that the school be open to all children; 
# that it be [[coeducational]]; 
# that it be a unified twelve-year school; 
# that the teachers, those individuals actually in contact with the children, have primary control over the [[pedagogy]] of the school, with a minimum of interference from the state or from economic sources.

On May 13, 1919, Molt, Steiner and [[E.A. Karl Stockmeyer]] had a preliminary discussion with the Education Ministry with the aim of finding a legal structure that would allow for an independent school. Stockmeyer was then given the task of finding teachers as a foundation for the future school. At the end of August, seventeen candidates for teaching positions attended what would be the first of many pedagogical courses sponsored by the school; twelve of these candidates were chosen to be the school's first teachers. The school opened on September 7, 1919 with 256 pupils in eight grades; 191 of the pupils were from factory families, the other 65 came from interested families from Stuttgart, many of whom were already engaged in the [[anthroposophical]] movement in that city. In the following years, a numerical balance between the factory workers' and outside children was achieved; it had been an explicit goal of the social three-folding movement to create a school that bridged social classes in this way. For the first year, the school was a company school and all teachers were listed as workers at Waldorf-Astoria, by the second year the school had become an independent entity.

The Stuttgart school grew quickly, adding a grade each year of secondary education, which thus by the 1923/4 school year included grades 9-12, and adding parallel classes in all grades. By 1926 there were more than 1,000 pupils in 28 classes.
Already, in 1922, Steiner had brought his educational ideas to an English-speaking audience when he delivered twelve lectures at [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford|Manchester College]] at the [[Oxford]] Conference&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2010) [http://orgprints.org/18810/1/Paull2010ManchesterJBDT.pdf  "A Postcard from Oxford: Rudolf Steiner at Manchester College"], "Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania", 100: 6-14.&lt;/ref&gt; on the philosophy and practice of education and the imperative for a moral component.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/18835/1/Paull2011OxfordEJES.pdf Rudolf Steiner and the Oxford Conference: The Birth of Waldorf Education in Britain]. European Journal of Educational Studies, 3(1): 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up in 1924 with a course by Steiner for teachers held at [[Torquay]] during Steiner's final visit to [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2018) [https://www.academia.edu/36404489/Torquay_In_the_Footsteps_of_Rudolf_Steiner Torquay: In the Footsteps of Rudolf Steiner], Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania. 125 (Mar): 26–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1928 attempt to found a Waldorf school in Nuremberg met with resistance from the Bavarian Education Ministry, which stated that there was the "no need in Bavaria for independent schools employing novel ideas, especially when they had no religious ties."

===Second World War===
The Stuttgart school grew rapidly, opening parallel classes, and by 1938 schools inspired by the original school or its pedagogical principles had been founded in the United States, UK, Switzerland, the [[Netherlands]], Norway, Austria, Hungary, and in other towns in Germany. Political interference from the [[Nazi]] regime limited and ultimately closed most Waldorf schools in Europe; the affected schools, including the original school, were reopened after the Second World War.&lt;ref name="Unc"&gt;P.

Three-quarters of the Waldorf schools today are located in Europe; schools are now being established in Eastern Europe, where communist regimes forbade Waldorf schools until their overthrow in 1989. In the English-speaking world, there are about 200 schools in the United States, 70 in Australia and New Zealand, 40 in Great Britain, and 30 in Canada; there are also many schools in New Zealand and South Africa.&lt;ref name=schulliste/&gt;

In 2006, state-run Steiner schools in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia were challenged by parents and religious experts over concerns that the schools derive from a spiritual system ([[anthroposophy]]); parents and administrators, as well as Victorian Department of Education authorities, presented divergent views as to whether spiritual or religious dimensions influence pedagogical practice. If present, these would contravene the [[secular]] basis of the public education system.&lt;ref name=religionreport&gt;Steiner education in state schools.

===Canada===
There are more than 30 independent Waldorf schools in Canada; for a current list see [http://www.maplesplendor.ca/waldorf_schools.htm here].

State schools using Waldorf-based methods include:
* French speaking: [https://web.archive.org/web/20120510131654/http://delaroseliere.csp.qc.ca/ Chambly], [[Montreal]], [[Waterville, Quebec|Waterville]], [[Victoriaville]], and [[Ottawa]]
* English speaking: [[Edmonton]], [[Calgary]] and [[Kelowna]].

===China===
The [[Chengdu]] Waldorf School was the first of its kind opened in China, in 2004, teaching about 500 students between the ages of three and eighteen.&lt;ref name=“veconomist” &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=China’s yuppies want schools to be more laid-back|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21730183-try-waldorf-chinas-yuppies-want-schools-be-more-laid-back|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total China has about 70 Waldorf schools located in its big cities.&lt;Ref name=“veconomist” /&gt;

===Finland===

In Finland there are 24 Steiner schools operating with 95 - 100% state financing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steinerkoulu.fi/index.php?page=steinerkoulut Finnish Steiner schools]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In the mid-1930s, the [[Nazi]] government began to pressure independent schools in Germany to conform to National Socialist social and educational principles or else face closure. By 1937, most of the German Waldorf schools had decided to cease operation rather than compromise their approach. In 1941, the last Waldorf school operating in Germany (in Dresden) was closed by the [[Gestapo]], as was the school in The Hague, in the occupied Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Werner and Christoph Lindenberg, ''Anthroposophen in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus (1933-1945)'', Oldenbourg Verlag, 1999, {{ISBN|3-486-56362-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Second World War, many of the earlier schools were re-established, and new schools founded at a rapid pace. A second boom in school foundation took place beginning in the 1970s.

There are now close to 200 schools in Germany.

===Russia===

Milestones in the development of Waldorf education include:
*1992 - The first Waldorf School in [[Russia ]] founded in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name=WaldRus&gt;Paull, John (2017) [https://www.academia.edu/35563554/The_First_Waldorf_School_in_Russia_A_Postcard_from_Moscow The First Waldorf School in Russia: A Postcard from Moscow], Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania. 124 (Dec): 14–17.&lt;/ref&gt;   
*1995/96 - The original Waldorf School in Moscow transitions to being state funded as School 1060.
*1995 - Association of Waldorf Schools of Russia is founded
*2017 - 25th anniversary of School 1080.

There are 18 Waldorf schools in Russia and 30 kindergartens.&lt;ref name=WaldRus&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There are five Waldorf schools in Moscow, as well as Waldorf schools in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Irkutsk]], [[Jaroslawl]], [[Kaluga]], [[Samara]], Schukowski, [[Smolensk]], [[Tomsk]], [[Ufa]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], [[Voronezh]], and [[Zelenograd]]].&lt;ref name=WaldRus&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some are funded by the government and some are privately funded. The Association of Waldorf Schools of Russia now has 21 members.&lt;ref name=WaldRus&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Various headmasters, teachers, and schools in Great Britain showed an early interest in the new educational methods; as a result Rudolf Steiner held a series of three lectures - in August, 1922 ([[Oxford]]), 1923 ([[Ilkley]]) and 1924 ([[Torquay]]) - introducing Waldorf principles. A number of groups then formed either seeking to transform their existing schools along Waldorf lines (e.g. The New School, Kings Langley in Hertfordshire) or to found new institutions.

*In 1922, a small boarding school housed at Friars Wood and located in the grounds of the former Royal Palace of the Plantagenet Kings of England at Kings Langley, in Hertfordshire, became the first school in the United Kingdom to seek to transform itself along Waldorf lines. However, while the transformation process began in 1922, it took a decade and a half to complete. During that time the school added extensive new buildings, opening fully in 1949 when it became known as 'The New School' Kings Langley (in an attempt not to be confused with nearby Kings Langley Grammar School - now Kings Langley Secondary School). Today, nearly sixty years on, 'The New School' has changed its name, and is simply known as [[Rudolf Steiner School Kings Langley]].
*In 1925, a school was founded near [[London]] but relocated during World War II to [[Minehead]] and again after the war to [[Forest Row]], [[Sussex]], in the process changing its name to Michael Hall. The school is therefore recognized as the first Waldorf school in Britain.
*In 1934 a small Steiner school was founded in Ilkeston, Michael House school 
*[[Wynstones School]] in [[Gloucester]] was founded by a small group of English teachers in 1935. Several prominent German Waldorf school teachers fleeing the Nazi regime supported the school's development in its early years, including [[Walter Johannes Stein]], [[Ernst Lehrs]], [[Eugen Kolisko]] and [[Bettina Mellinger]].
*Edinburgh Steiner School in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland was also founded around 1935.

These four, which grew to become comprehensive schools for ages 12 through 18, became the mainstay of the Waldorf movement in Britain for many years, and they remain the only British schools to provide education up until age 18.

In 1938, a small group of refugees from the Nazis, led by [[Karl Konig]], founded the first school (in Britain) providing special education on Waldorf principles. These Steiner special schools, part of the [[Camphill movement]] of communities for the handicapped, spread widely throughout Britain and, later, in many other countries in the world.

Beginning in the late 1940s, further schools were founded, including 
* Elmfield school in [[Stourbridge]]

A increase in new schools occurred in the 1970s, and another in the 1990s, continuing today. After repeated initiatives to open a school in London; there are now four such schools: 
*St. Paul's school, in [[Islington]]
*St. Michael Steiner school
*Greenwich Steiner school, in [[Greenwich]]
*Waldorf School of South West London, in [[Streatham]]

In July 2008, the Hereford Waldorf School in [[Much Dewchurch]], [[Herefordshire]], U.K. secured funding to become a [[Academy (English school)|state-funded academy]] specializing in the natural environment, to be known as The [[Steiner Academy Hereford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Bowen |url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/news/3544197.New_academy_to_open_in_Hereford/ |title=New academy to open in Hereford |publisher=Hereford Times |date= 24 July 2008 |accessdate= 2008-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are now about 40 Waldorf/Steiner schools in Great Britain and Ireland, which together make up the [[Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship]].

===United States===

Milestones in the early years of Waldorf education include:
*1928 - Rudolf Steiner School of [[New York City]] becomes the first Waldorf School in the US.  
*1941 - Kimberton Waldorf School is founded in [[Pennsylvania]].
*1947 - The Waldorf School of Garden City is created as part of [[Adelphi University]].  
*1942 - [[High Mowing School|High Mowing Waldorf School]], a boarding high school in [[Wilton, New Hampshire]] opens.

Three more Waldorf schools were founded in the 1950s, and five in the 1960s.  In 1968 the original Association of Waldorf Schools was founded with these twelve schools. With the 1970s came expansive growth leading to the more than 250 schools and early childhood programs today {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.  Thirty-seven new high schools have been started in the last decade. The growth of Waldorf schools in the U.S. has followed a smooth curve, roughly doubling every ten years.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen K. Sagarin, ''Promise and compromise: A history of Waldorf schools in the United States, 1928--1998'', Ph. D. thesis, Columbia University, 2004.

In the 1990s, the first public Waldorf school was established when a principal of an inner-city public school in [[Milwaukee]] became interested in using Waldorf methods. The school is now known as the Urban Waldorf Elementary School of Milwaukee. The next public school to incorporate Waldorf methodology was the John Morse Waldorf Method Magnet School in [[Sacramento]], [[California]]. A number of public school systems in other cities, including [[Los Angeles]], have also established public Waldorf schools.

Waldorf charter schools have been established in California and [[Arizona]].

In the 1990s, a Waldorf school was established in the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] in [[South Dakota]] as a bridge between the traditional spirituality of Native Americans and modern American society.

The U.S., Canadian and Mexican schools are represented by the [http://www.awsna.org/ Association of Waldorf Schools of North America]. Waldorf and Steiner are registered and protected names, and in the United States, the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA) protects this usage. Schools that use substantial portions of the methodology of Waldorf education but are not independent enough to apply all of the latter's principles refer to themselves as  ''Waldorf-method,'' or "Waldorf Inspired" schools; these are primarily found as charter schools which are part of the [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system in the United States and, as government schools, are not included in the above figures.

As of 2011 there are 44 publicly funded Waldorf schools in the United States; some of these are state-run public schools, while 18&lt;ref&gt;[http://allianceforpublicwaldorfeducation.org/content/view/13/38/ list of charter schools in the USA]&lt;/ref&gt; are [[charter schools]]. 
* The first US public Waldorf school, the [[Milwaukee Urban Waldorf School]], began using Waldorf methods in 1991; since switching to Waldorf methods, the school showed an increase in parental involvement, a reduction in suspensions, improvements in standardized test scores for both reading and writing (counter to the district trend), while expenditures per pupil were below many regular district programs.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Richard R. Doornek, Educational Curriculum specialist with the [[Milwaukee Public Schools]] quoted in Phaizon Rhys Wood, ''Beyond Survival: A Case Study of the Milwaukee Urban Waldorf School'', dissertation, School of Education, University of San Francisco, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
* The country's first public Waldorf high school, the George Washington Carver School of Arts and Sciences, was founded in Sacramento, CA in 2008. Over the school's first three years, test scores rose dramatically; from 67% of 11th graders scoring below or far below basic standards to 12% doing so. The school's teachers also prefer the new approach.&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pappano|first=Laura|journal=Harvard Education Letter|date=November–December 2011|volume=27|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Waldorf students tend to score considerably below district peers in the early years of elementary education and equal to, or in some cases considerably above, district peers by eighth grade. Some charter and public schools have responded to this data by increasing the schools' focus on academic learning in the early grades.&lt;ref name=Harvard/&gt;
* [[California]] has more publicly funded Waldorf schools than any other US state.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Internal organization==
The majority of Waldorf schools are independent, so each school may have different structures and policies.

As a general rule, however, independent Waldorf schools are administered through the collaborative leadership of teachers. The primary governing body is thus a College or Council of Teachers working to provide at least the pedagogical direction. In some countries, including the United States, Boards of Trustees are responsible for other aspects of administration, particularly ensuring the schools' financial and legal soundness. A move towards shared responsibility of governance with the hiring of administrators, particularly an Administrative Chair and Finance Chair, who work in conjunction with the Faculty Chair to create the Leadership Team, has seen traction and schools are finding individual balances of structure and governance between the collaborative teachers groups and the administrators. Much of the compliance with legal frameworks and the traditional responsibilities of a Human Resources Department are being shifted to these administrators, along with traditional school needs such as Admissions/Enrollment, systems and protocols.

A number of schools in the United States (Waldorf public and [[Charter schools in the United States|charter]] programs), England (Steiner [[Academy (English school)|Academies]]), New Zealand, and Australia (Steiner stream) have close links with or are overseen by State education authorities.

'''The Holy Cross Sermons''' ({{lang-pl|Kazania świętokrzyskie}}) are the oldest extant prose text in the [[Polish language]], dating probably from the late 13th, or from the early 14th century. The documents are named after the place where they were originally housed – the [[Św. Krzyż Monastery|Holy Cross Monastery]] ([[:pl:Sanktuarium na Świętym Krzyżu|pl]]) in Poland's [[Świętokrzyskie Mountains|Holy Cross Mountains]] (Polish:  ''Góry Świętokrzyskie''). They were discovered in striped [[parchment]] pieces in 1890 by [[Aleksander Brückner]], in the binding of a Latin language [[codex]], which contained the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the [[Apocalypse]]. The sermons were first published in 1891, in a "Philological Works" ("Prace Filologiczne") magazine. In 1934, [[facsimile]]s of the text were published by the [[Polish Academy of Learning]], and in 2009, new, full edition of the sermons was issued, prepared by professor Pawel Stepien.

== History ==
Even though Aleksander Bruckner claimed that the text was originally housed at the Holy Cross Monastery, this hypothesis has been criticized by some scholars. According to historian Wladyslaw Semkowicz, the codex, already strengthened with parchment stripes, was delivered to a Benedictine monastery at [[Leżajsk]], in circa 1459. The Leżajsk monastery, however, was not the location where the sermons were written. Language analysis, carried out by Polish experts proved that the text was probably written in a monastery in [[Miechów]], which was famous for its sermons and library, and which cooperated with the Leżajsk monastery. On the other hand, if sermons were written in the 13th century, then their Miechów origins are dubious. At that time, this monastery was made of monks of Czech and German origin, who either did not speak Polish, or spoke it poorly, and who were unable to write down the complicated text.

Some time in the 15th century, the sermons were cut into strips, which were used to strengthen the binding of a Latin language [[codex]]. Most likely, other parts of the sermons were used in bindings of other books. This practice was common at the time, as parchment was both durable and expensive, so publications regarded as unnecessary or unimportant were frequently used to strengthen other, more precious books.

Aleksander Bruckner discovered the sermons on March 25, 1890, at the Imperial Public Library in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russian Empire]]. He was studying an ancient Latin codex, which had belonged to the [[Warsaw University]] library, and was confiscated by the Russians after the [[November Uprising]] (1831). In the binding of the book, Bruckner to his surprise found eighteen long strips. After putting them together, it turned out that they contained one whole, and five incomplete sermons. They were brought back to Poland in 1925. During World War II, the Holy Cross Sermons were taken to Canada for safekeeping. They are now preserved at the [[Polish National Library|National Library]] in [[Warsaw]] (#8001), and their photocopy may be seen at The Digital National Library Polona ([http://www.polona.pl/dlibra/doccontent2?id=197&amp;from=&amp;from=generalsearch&amp;dirids=1 See electronic version of the Holy Cross Sermons]).

== Description ==
The [[sermon]]s, on the occasions of Church holy days, comprise fragments of five texts and one complete sermon (for [[St. Catherine's Day]]). Written on parchment, they had been cut into thin strips and used to reinforce the binding of a 15th-century [[Latin]] manuscript. The fifteen strips, put together by Bruckner, make one sheet (117 × 173&amp;nbsp;mm), and the remaining three strips make  the bottom of a second sheet.

Linguistically, the Holy Cross Sermons reflect an older stage of the language than the 14th century, the manuscript being a copy of original sermons composed some time from the end of the 13th century. They manifest a variety of linguistic archaisms, for instance:

1) Hard-stem declension of the pronoun ''*tъnъ'' 'this one': Nom. sg. ''ten'', Gen. sg. ''togo'', Dat. sg. ''tomu'';

2) [[Aorist]] and [[Imperfect]]:

- 1 sg. aor. ''widziech'' (cf. Lat. perf. ''vidi'') &lt; PSl. ''*viděti'' 'to see, to look', ''*viděxъ'' 'I saw, I looked (at); I have seen, I have looked (at)';

- 3 sg. aor. ''postawi'' (cf. Lat. perf. ''posuit'') &lt; PSl. ''*postaviti'' 'to place', ''*postavi'' 'he/she/it placed, has placed';

- 3 pl. aor. ''pośpieszychą się'' (cf. Lat. perf. ''venerunt'') &lt; PSl. ''*pospěšiti'' 'to go, to go somewhere', ''*pospěšixǫ'' 'they went, they went somewhere, they went out';

- 3 sg. impf. ''biesze'' (cf. Lat. impf. ''erat'') &lt; PSl. ''*byti'' 'to be', ''*běaše'' 'he/she/it was';

- 3 sg. impf. ''siedziesze'' (cf. Lat. impf. ''sedebat'') &lt; PSl. ''*sěděti'' 'to sit', ''*sěděaše'' 'he/she/it sat, was sitting'.

== Contents ==
The strips contain whole sermon for [[St. Catherine's Day]] (November 25), and parts of sermons for the following days:
* [[Michaelmas]] (September 29),
* [[Saint Nicholas Day]] (December 6),
* [[Christmas]] (December 24),
* [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] (called in Poland Three Kings’ Day, January 6),
* [[Feast of the Purification of the Virgin]] (February 2).

{{nihongo|'''Hōrin-ji'''|法輪寺|}} is a [[Rinzai]] [[Buddhist]] [[temple]] in [[Himeji]], [[Hyōgo Prefecture]] (formerly [[Harima province]]).

==History==
With the patronage of the [[Akamatsu clan]], [[Sesson Yūbai]] was able to become the founder of a number of provincial [[List of Buddhist temples|Buddhist temple]]-[[Monastery#Buddhist monasteries|monasteries]], including Hōrin-ji in Harima.&lt;ref name="hall600-603"&gt;Hall, John Whitney. (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=nT9CI5YQF_4C&amp;pg=PA644&amp;dq=  ''The Cambridge History of Japan,'' pp.  600-603.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hōrin-ji was ranked among the provincial ''[[jissatsu]]'' by the [[Muromachi shogunate]],&lt;ref name="hall600-603"/&gt; which encouraged its ''shugo'' vassals to found monasteries in their domains.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nT9CI5YQF_4C&amp;pg=PA644&amp;dq=sesson+yubai#v=onepage&amp;q=sesson%20yubai&amp;f=false   p. 602.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent among Yūbai's followers were [[Akamatsu Norimura]] (1277-1350) and his son [[Akamatsu Norisuke]] (1314-1371).&lt;ref name="hall600-603"/&gt;

}}'''Johann Wilhelm Ritter''' (16 December 1776 – 23 January 1810) was a [[Germans|German]] [[chemist]], [[physicist]] and [[philosopher]]. He was born in [[Zamienice|Samitz]] (Zamienice) near [[Chojnów|Haynau]] (Chojnów) in [[Silesia]] (then part of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], since 1945 in [[Poland]]), and died in [[Munich]].

==Life and work==
Johann Wilhelm Ritter's first involvement with science began when he was 14 years old. He became an apprentice to an apothecary in [[Legnica|Liegnitz]] (Legnica), and acquired a deep interest in chemistry. He began medicine studies at the [[University of Jena]] in 1796. A self-taught scientist, he made many experimental researches on chemistry, electricity and other fields.

Ritter belonged to the [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Walter D. Wetzels (1990), "Johann Wilhelm Ritter: Romantic Physics in Germany", in ''Romanticism and the Sciences'', eds. [[Andrew Cunningham (academic)|Andrew Cunningham]] and [[Nicholas Jardine]]. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 199-212. {{ISBN|0-521-35602-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was personally acquainted with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Clemens Brentano]]. He was strongly influenced by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], who was the main philosopher of the ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' movement. In 1801, [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] visited Jena and became his friend. Several of Ritter's researches were latter reported by Ørsted, who was also strongly influenced by the philosophical outlook of ''Naturphilosophie''.&lt;ref name="magnetochemistry"&gt;Roberto de Andrade Martins (2007), "Ørsted, Ritter and magnetochemistry", in ''Hans Christian Ørsted and the Romantic Legacy in Science: Ideas, Disciplines, Practices'', eds. R.M. Brain, R. S. Cohen &amp; O. Knudsen (Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, vol. 241), New York: Springer, pp. 339-385. ({{ISBN|978-1-4020-2979-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritter's first scientific researches concerned some galvanic phenomena. He interpreted the physiological effects observed by [[Luigi Galvani]] and other researchers as due to the electricity generated by chemical reactions. His interpretation is closer to the one accepted nowadays than those proposed by Galvani (“animal electricity”) and [[Alessandro Volta]] (electricity generated by metallic contact), but it was not accepted at the time. 
[[File:Ritter Wasserelektrolyse.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Illustration of an [[electrolysis]] apparatus by Ritter, 1800]]
In 1800, shortly after the invention of the [[voltaic pile]], [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]] and [[Anthony Carlisle]] discovered that water could be decomposed by electricity. Shortly afterward, Ritter also discovered the same effect, independently. Besides that, he collected and measured the amounts of hydrogen and oxygen produced in the reaction. He also discovered the process of [[electroplating]]. In 1802 he built his first [[electrochemical cell]], with 50 copper discs separated by cardboard disks moistened by a salt solution.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Berg (2008), "[http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/revpolarography/54/2/54_99/_article  Johann Wilhelm Ritter – The Founder of Scientific Electrochemistry]"{{dead link|date=December 2012}}, ''Review of Polarography'', Vol. 54, No. 2, pp. 99-103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter D. Wetzels (1978), "J. W. Ritter: The Beginnings of Electrochemistry in Germany", in: ''Selected Topics in the History of Electrochemistry'', eds. G. Dubpernell and J. H. Westbrook. Princeton: The Electrochemical Society, pp. 68-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritter made several self-experiments applying the poles of a voltaic pile to his own hands, eyes, ears, nose and tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Walker Strickland (1998), "The Ideology of Self-Knowledge and the Practice of Self-Experimentation", ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'', Vol. 31, No. 4, pp. 453-471.&lt;/ref&gt; He also described the difference between the physiological effects of the two poles of the pile, although some of the effects he reported were not confirmed afterwards.

Many of Ritter's researches were guided by a search for polarities in the several "forces" of nature, and for the relation between those "forces" – two of the assumptions of ''Naturphilosophie''. In 1801, after hearing about the discovery of "heat rays" ([[infrared radiation]]) by [[William Herschel]] (in 1800), Ritter looked for an opposite (cooling) radiation at the other end of the visible spectrum. He did not find exactly what he expected to find, but after a series of attempts he noticed that [[silver chloride]] was transformed faster from white to black when it was placed at the dark region of the Sun's spectrum, close to its violet end. The "chemical rays" found by him were afterwards called [[ultraviolet]] radiation.&lt;ref&gt;Armin Hermann (1987), "Unity and metamorphosis of forces (1800-1850): Schelling, Oersted and Faraday”, in ''Symmetries in Physics (1600-1980)'', eds. M. G. Doncel, A. Hermann, L. Michel and A. Pais. Barcelona: Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, pp. 51-62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Frercksa, Heiko Weberb, and Gerhard Wiesenfeldt (2009), "Reception and discovery: the nature of Johann Wilhelm Ritter’s invisible rays", ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A'', Vol. 40, No. 2, pp 143-156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ultraviolet Waves|url=http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127004149/http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html|archivedate=2011-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Ritter's researches were acknowledged as important scientific contributions, but he also claimed the discovery of many phenomena that were not confirmed by other researchers. For instance: he reported that the Earth had electric poles that could be detected by the motion of a bimetallic needle; and he claimed that he could produce the electrolysis of water using a series of magnets, instead of Volta's piles.&lt;ref name="magnetochemistry"/&gt;

Ritter had no regular income and never became a university professor, although in 1804 he was elected a member of the Bavarian Academy of Science (in Munich). He married in 1804 and had four children, but he was unable to provide the needs of his family. Plagued by financial difficulties and suffering from weak health (perhaps aggravated by his electrical self-experimentation), he died young in 1810, as a poor man.

'''José Francisco Correia da Serra''' (6 June 1750 – 11 September 1823) was a Portuguese [[Abbot]], [[polymath]] – philosopher, diplomat, politician and scientist.&lt;ref&gt;Diogo, Maria Paula Diogo, Ana Carneiro1 and Ana Simões. "The Portuguese naturalist Correia da Serra (1751–1823) and his impact on early nineteenth-century botany," ''Journal of the History of Biology." (June 2001) 34:2, 353–393.&lt;/ref&gt; In some circumstances, he was also known as ''[[Abbé]] Correa.''&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Maxwell (2000), ''Was Brazil Different? The Contexts of Independence'', Harvard University, John Parry Memorial Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt; The plant genus [[Correa (plant)|Correa]] is named in his honour.

==Biography==
Correia da Serra was born at [[Serpa]], in [[Alentejo]], in 1750, and was educated at Rome, where he took [[holy orders]]. In 1777 he returned to [[Lisbon]], where he was one of the founders of the [[Academia das Ciências de Lisboa]] in 1779 (then called ''Academia Real das Ciências de Lisboa''; ''Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon'').{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

His published writings brought him into conflict with reactionary members of the religious and political hierarchy in Portugal.

In 1786, he fled to France, and remained there till the death of [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese King-consort]] [[Peter III of Portugal|Pedro III]], when he again returned to his homeland, but political difficulties forced him to leave the country again.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} 
He went to England, where he found a protector in Sir [[Joseph Banks]], who was [[President of the Royal Society|President]] of the [[Royal Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Archives of the Royal Society.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With Banks' support, he was easily elected a fellow of the society. 
In 1797, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

In 1797, he was appointed secretary to the Portuguese embassy in London, but a quarrel with the ambassador drove him once more to Paris (1802). He would stay in Paris for the next eleven years.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1813, he left Europe for the [[New World]], arriving first in New York City.  
His travels took him several times to [[Monticello]], the home of former President [[Thomas Jefferson]] where his political views found a fulsome reception.&lt;ref name="JeffWiki"&gt;[http://wiki.monticello.org/mediawiki/index.php/Jose_Correia_da_Serra  Monticello.org.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509021959/http://wiki.monticello.org/mediawiki/index.php/Jose_Correia_da_Serra |date=9 May 2008 }}, Jose Correia da Serra&lt;/ref&gt; 
He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1815.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter C|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterC.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816, he was made Portuguese minister-plenipotentiary at Washington D.C., but resided in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="JeffWiki" /&gt;{{citation needed|reason=existing cite doesn't say that he lived in Philadelphia and 1816 Congressional Directory lists him as living in Mrs. Wilson's boarding house on Pennsylvania Avenue|date=June 2015}}

In 1820, he was recalled home to Portugal, where he was appointed a member of the financial council, and elected to a seat in the "General Extraordinary and Constituent ''Cortes'' of the Portuguese Nation", but he died only three years later.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

'''Kazimierz Kelles-Krauz''' (22 March 1872 &amp;ndash; 24 June 1905) was a [[Poland|Polish]] philosopher and sociologist, member of the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. He was one of the most significant [[Marxist]] thinkers at the end of the 19th century.

Kelles-Krauz was born in [[Szczebrzeszyn]], [[Russian Empire]] and died in [[Pernitz]], [[Austria-Hungary]].

His greatest contribution to [[sociology]] is the "[[law of retrospective revolution]]" according to which "the ideals with which each [[social movement|reform movement]] tries to replace existing [[social norms]] are always similar to the norms of a more or less distant past".

[[Yale]]'s [[Timothy Snyder]] argues that Kelles-Krauz, writing two decades before [[Hans Kohn]] and [[Carlton Hayes]], ought to be among the small cluster of turn-of-the-century thinkers regarded as the pioneers of the modern study of nationalism.

'''Kyudo Nakagawa''' ('''中川 球童''', February 12, 1927—December 29, 2007), or '''Nakagawa Kyūdō''', was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]]-born [[Rinzai]] [[rōshi]] who for many years led Soho Zen Buddhist Society, Inc. in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]]. 

==Biography==
A [[Dharma heir]] of the late [[Soen Nakagawa]]&lt;ref&gt;Brazier, 171&lt;/ref&gt;—who is of no familial relation—Kyudo first became a [[Zen]] monk at age eight. He undertook Buddhist studies at [[Japan]]'s renowned [[Komazawa University]] and entered Gukei-ji.&lt;ref name="fisher"&gt;Fisher; 35&lt;/ref&gt; Then, at age thirty, Kyudo entered [[Ryūtaku-ji]] temple and trained under Soen Nakagawa. In 1968 he moved to [[Jerusalem]] to lead a center Soen had opened in [[Israel]] called Kibutsu-ji, where he stayed on for thirteen years. Kyudo then returned to Ryūtaku-ji briefly and moved to [[New York City]], where he led the Soho Zen Buddhist Society, Inc. He also made occasional trips to [[England]] now and then to lead the London Zen Society.&lt;ref&gt;Snelling, 205&lt;/ref&gt; 

After Soen Roshi's death in 1984, Sochu Suzuki Roshi became abbot of Ryūtaku-ji. When Sochu Roshi died in 1990, Kyudo became abbot of Ryūtaku-ji. He died on December 29, 2007 at the age of eighty.&lt;ref name="fisher"/&gt;  The Soho Zen Buddhist Society, Inc. in Manhattan closed its practice center, the Soho Zendo at 464 West Broadway, following Kyudo's death. Among others, he trained [[Lawrence Shainberg]], author of ''Ambivalent Zen'', which discusses Kyudo's teachings and provides an intimate portrait of this Zen master.&lt;ref&gt;Shainberg&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of Kyudo Nakagawa, Roshi's talks can be found on line here: http://www.engaged-zen.org/articles/Kyudo.html

'''Mental factors''' ({{lang-sa|caitasika}}; {{lang-pi|cetasika}}; Tibetan Wylie: ''sems byung''), in [[Buddhism]], are identified within the teachings of the [[Abhidhamma]] (Buddhist psychology). They are defined as aspects of the mind that apprehend the quality of an object, and that have the ability to color the mind. Within the Abhidhamma, the mental factors are categorized as formations ({{lang-sa|saṅkhāra}}) concurrent with mind ({{lang-sa|citta}}).&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Location 321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geshe Tashi Tsering 2006"&gt;Geshe Tashi Tsering (2006), Kindle Location 456.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternate translations for mental factors include "mental states", "mental events", and "concomitants of consciousness".

==Introduction==
Mental factors are aspects of the mind that apprehend the quality of an object and have the ability to color the mind. Geshe Tashi Tsering explains:
:The Tibetan for mental factors, ''semlay jungwa chö'' (Skt. ''chaitasika dharma''), means phenomena arising from the mind, suggesting that the mental factors are not primary to the mind but arise within a larger framework. A mental factor, again, is defined as the aspect of the mind that apprehends a particular quality of an object. Because it is characterized by the qualities of activity and non-neutrality, it has the ability to color the mind in dependence on the way it manifests. Hence, a feeling of desire from seeing what is conceived as a beautiful object affects the other mental factors that are present at that time, and this colors the whole mind.&lt;ref&gt;Geshe Tashi Tsering (2006), Kindle Locations 564-568.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between the main mind (Sanskrit: [[citta]]) and the mental factors can be described by the following metaphors:
* The main mind is like screen in a cinema, and the mental factors are like the images projected on the screen. In this analogy, we typically do not notice the screen because we are so caught up on the images.
* The main mind is like a king who sits passively on a throne, and the mental factors are like the king's busy ministers.&lt;ref name="Geshe Tashi Tsering 2006"/&gt;

Traleg Rinpoche states that the main distinction between the mind and mental factors is that the mind apprehends an object as a whole, whereas mental factors apprehend an object in its particulars.&lt;ref name=traleg1&gt;Traleg Rinpoche (1993). p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Traleg Rinpoche states: "The fundamental distinction made in Yogacara philosophy between the mind and mental events is that the mind apprehends an object as a whole, whereas mental events apprehend an object in its particulars. If we perceive a table, then the perception of the table itself would be related to the mind, whereas the particular characteristics of that table would be the object of perception for the mental events. First, we have an immediate perception of the table. After that, we have certain feeling-tones, certain judgments, involved with that particular perception. Those things are related to the mental events. The immediate perception is the only thing related to the mind. That seems to be the major distinction between the mind and the mental events."&lt;ref name=traleg1/&gt;}}

==Lists of mental factors==
Within Buddhism, there are many different systems of [[abhidharma]] (commonly referred to as Buddhist psychology), and each system contains its own list of the most significant mental factors.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Alexander Berzin states: "There are many different systems of abhidharma (chos-mngon-pa, topics of knowledge), each with its individual count and list of subsidiary awarenesses. Often, the definitions of the awarenesses they assert in common differ as well."&lt;ref name=berzin1&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/science-of-mind/mind-mental-factors/primary-minds-and-the-51-mental-factors ''Primary Minds and the 51 Mental Factors'' by Alexander Berzin] (see section "Count of the Mental Factors")&lt;/ref&gt; }}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Bikkhu Bodhi states: "A second distinguishing feature of the Abhidhamma is the dissection of the apparently continuous stream of consciousness into a succession of discrete evanescent cognitive events called cittas, each a complex unity involving consciousness itself, as the basic awareness of an object, and a constellation of mental factors (cetasika) exercising more specialized tasks in the act of cognition. Such a view of consciousness, at least in outline, can readily be derived from the Sutta Pitaka's analysis of experience into the five aggregates, among which the four mental aggregates are always inseparably conjoined, but the conception remains there merely suggestive. In the Abhidhamma Pitaka the suggestion is not simply picked up, but is expanded into an extraordinarily detailed and coherent picture of the functioning of consciousness both in its microscopic immediacy and in its extended continuity from life to life."&lt;ref name=bhodhi1&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/abhiman.html ''A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} These lists vary from system to system both in the number of mental factors listed, and in the definitions that are given for each mental factor. These lists are not considered to be exhaustive; rather they present significant categories and mental factors that are useful to study in order to understand how the mind functions.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The lists of mental factors are not considered to be exhaustive. For example:
* The Dalai Lama states: “Whether the system includes fifty-one mental factors or more or less, none of those sets is meant to be all-inclusive, as though nothing is left out. They are only suggestive, indicative of some things that are important.”{{sfn|Goleman|2008|loc=Kindle Locations 3628-3631}}
* Alexander Berzin states: "These lists of subsidiary awarenesses are not exhaustive. There are many more than just fifty-one. Many good qualities (yon-tan) cultivated on the Buddhist path are not listed separately – for example, generosity (sbyin-pa), ethical discipline (tshul-khrims), patience (bzod-pa), love (byams-pa), and compassion (snying-rje). According to the Gelug presentation, the five types of deep awareness (ye-shes) – mirror-like, equalizing, individualizing, accomplishing, and sphere of reality (Skt. dharmadhatu) – are also subsidiary awarenesses. The various lists are just of certain significant categories of subsidiary awarenesses."&lt;ref name=berzin1/&gt;}}

==Theravāda Abhidharma tradition==
Within the Theravāda tradition, the [[Abhidhammattha-sangaha]] enumerates the fifty-two mental factors listed below:{{refn|group=lower-alpha|These fifty-two mental states are enumerated and defined in chapter 2 of the ''[[Abhidhammattha-sangaha]]''. See: 
* [http://www.palikanon.com/english/sangaha/chapter_2.htm Abhidhammattha-sangaha (Chapter 2)] translated by Nārada Thera, et al.&lt;ref name=thera1&gt;[http://www.palikanon.com/english/sangaha/sangaha.htm ''Abhidhammattha-sangaha'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/mendis/wheel322.html#cetasika The Abhidhamma in Practice: The Cetasikas]}}

Note that this list is not exhaustive; there are other mental factors mentioned in the Theravada teachings. This list identifies fifty-two important factors that help to understand how the mind functions.

===Seven universal mental factors===
The seven universal mental factors (''sabbacittasādhāraṇa cetasikas'') are common (''sādhāraṇa'') to all consciousness (''sabbacitta''). [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] states: "These factors perform the most rudimentary and essential cognitive functions, without which consciousness of an object would be utterly impossible."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2140-2142}}

These seven factors are:
* ''[[Phassa]]'' - contact 
* ''[[Vedanā]]'' - feeling
* ''[[Saññā]]'' - perception
* ''[[Cetanā]]'' - volition
* ''[[Ekaggata]]'' - one-pointedness
* ''[[Jīvitindriya]]'' - life faculty
* ''[[Manasikāra]]'' - attention

===Six occasional mental factors===
The six occasional or particular mental factors (''pakiṇṇaka cetasikas'') are ethically variable mental factors found only in certain consciousnesses.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2232-2234}} They are:
* ''[[Vitakka]]'' - Application of thought
* ''[[Vicāra]]'' - Examining
* ''[[Adhimokkha]]'' - Decision
* ''[[Viriya]]'' - Energy
* ''[[Pīti]]'' - Rapture
* ''[[Chanda (Buddhism)|Chanda]]'' - Desire (to act)

===Fourteen unwholesome mental factors===
The unwholesome mental factors (''akusala cetasikas'') accompany the unwholesome consciousnesses (''akusala citta'').

Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 1320-1324}}
:Unwholesome consciousness (''akusalacitta'') is consciousness accompanied by one or another of the three unwholesome roots—greed, hatred, and delusion. Such consciousness is called unwholesome because it is mentally unhealthy, morally blameworthy, and productive of painful results. 

The fourteen unwholesome mental factors are:
* Four universal unwholesome mental factors (''akusalasādhāraṇa''):
** ''[[Moha (Buddhism)|Moha]]'' - delusion 
** ''[[Ahirika]]'' - lack of shame
** ''[[Anottappa]]'' - disregard for consequence
** ''[[Uddhacca]]'' - restlessness
* Three mental factors of the greed-group (''lobha''):
** ''[[Raga (Buddhism)|Lobha]]'' - greed
** ''[[View (Buddhism)|Diṭṭhi]]'' - wrong view
** ''[[Māna]]'' - conceit
* Four mental factors of the hatred-group (''dosa'')
** ''[[Dvesha (Buddhism)|Dosa]]'' - hatred
** ''[[Issā]]'' - envy
** ''[[Macchariya]]'' - miserliness

** ''[[Middha]]'' - torpor
** ''[[Vicikicchā]]'' - doubt

===Twenty-five beautiful mental factors===
The beautiful mental factors (''sobhana cetasikas'') accompany the wholesome consciousnesses (''kusala citta'').

Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 1320-1324}}
:Wholesome consciousness (''kusalacitta'') is consciousness accompanied by the wholesome roots—non-greed or generosity, non-hatred or loving-kindness, and non-delusion or wisdom. Such consciousness is mentally healthy, morally blameless, and productive of pleasant results.

The twenty-five beautiful mental factors (''sobhana cetasikas'') are:
* Nineteen universal beautiful mental factors (''sobhanasādhāraṇa''):

==Mahayana Abhidharma tradition==
Abhidharma studies in the Mahayana tradition are based on the Sanskrit Sarvāstivāda abhidharma system. Within this system, the [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] identifies fifty-one mental factors:

===Five universal mental factors ===
The five universal mental factors (''sarvatraga'') are:
# ''[[Sparśa]]'' - contact, contacting awareness, sense impression, touch
# ''[[Vedanā]]'' - feeling, sensation
# ''[[Saṃjñā]]'' - perception
# ''[[Cetanā]]'' - volition, intention
# ''[[Manasikara]]'' - attention

These five mental factors are referred to as ''universal'' or ''omnipresent'' because they operate in the wake of every mind situation. If any one of these factors is missing, then the experience of the object is incomplete. For example:
* If there is no ''sparśa'' (contact), then there would be no basis for perception.
* If there is no ''vedana'' (feeling, sensation), there is no relishing of the object.
* If there is no ''saṃjñā'' (perception), then the specific characteristic of the object is not perceived.
* If there is no ''cetanā'' (volition), then there is no movement towards and settling on the object.
* If there is no ''manasikara'' (attention), then there is not holding onto the object.&lt;ref&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Location 409-414.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Five object-determining mental factors ===
The five object-determining mental factors (''viṣayaniyata'') are:
# ''[[Chanda (Buddhism)|Chanda]]'' - desire (to act), intention, interest
# ''[[Adhimoksha]]'' - decision, interest, firm conviction
# ''[[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|Smṛti]]'' - mindfulness
# ''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|Prajñā]]'' - wisdom
# ''[[Samādhi]]'' - concentration

The five factors are referred to as ''object-determining'' is because these factors each grasp the specification of the object. When they are steady, there is certainty concerning each object.&lt;ref&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Location 487-488.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eleven virtuous mental factors===
The eleven virtuous (''kuśala'') mental factors are:
# ''[[Saddhā|Sraddhā]]'' - faith
# ''[[Hri (Buddhism)|Hrī]]'' - self-respect, conscientiousness, sense of shame
# ''[[Apatrāpya]]'' - decorum, regard for consequence
# ''[[Alobha]]'' - non-attachment
# ''[[Adveṣa]]'' - non-aggression, equanimity, lack of hatred
# ''[[Amoha]]'' - non-bewilderment
# ''[[Vīrya]]'' - diligence, effort
# ''[[Praśrabdhi]]'' - pliancy
# ''[[Apramāda]]'' - conscientiousness
# ''[[Upekṣa]]'' - equanimity
# ''[[Ahiṃsā]]'' - nonharmfulness

===Six root unwholesome factors===
The six root unwholesome factors (''mūlakleśa'') are:
# ''[[Raga (Buddhism)|Raga]]'' - attachment
# ''[[Pratigha]]'' - anger
# ''[[Avidya (Buddhism)|Avidya]]'' - ignorance
# ''[[Māna]]'' - pride, conceit
# ''[[Vicikitsa]]'' - doubt
# ''[[View (Buddhism)|Dṛiṣṭi]]'' - wrong view

===Twenty secondary unwholesome factors ===
The twenty secondary unwholesome factors (''upakleśa'') are:
#''[[Krodha (Mental factor)|Krodha]]'' - rage, fury
#''[[Upanāha]]'' - resentment
#''[[Mrakśa]]'' - concealment, slyness-concealment
#''[[Pradāśa]]'' - spitefulness
#''[[Irshya]]'' - envy, jealousy
#''[[Mātsarya]]'' - stinginess, avarice, miserliness
#''[[Maya (Buddhist mental factor)|Māyā]]'' - pretense, deceit
#''[[Asāṭhya]]'' - hypocrisy, dishonesty
#''[[Mada (Buddhism)|Mada]]'' - self-infatuation, mental inflation, self-satisfaction
#''[[Vihiṃsā]]'' - malice, hostility, cruelty, intention to harm
#''[[Āhrīkya]]'' - lack of shame, lack of conscience, shamelessness
#''[[Anapatrāpya]]'' - lack of propriety, disregard, shamelessness

The four changeable mental factors (''aniyata'') are:
#''[[Kaukṛitya]]'' - regret, worry,
#''[[Middha]]'' - sleep, drowsiness
#''[[Vitarka]]'' - conception, selectiveness, examination
#''[[Vicāra]]'' - discernment, discursiveness, analysis

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13444">'''Modal realism''' is the view propounded by [[David Kellogg Lewis]] that all [[possible world]]s are real in the same way as is the actual world: they are "of a kind with this world of ours."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis D, 1986, p2, On the Plurality of Worlds, Oxford, Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is based on the following tenets: possible worlds [[existence|exist]]; possible worlds are not different in kind from the actual world; possible worlds are [[Reduction (philosophy)|irreducible]] [[entity|entities]]; the term ''actual'' in ''actual world'' is [[indexicality|indexical]], i.e. any subject can declare their world to be the actual one, much as they
label the place they are "here" and the time they are "now".

== The term ''possible world'' ==
The term goes back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz's]] theory of possible worlds, used to analyse necessity, [[Logical possibility|possibility]], and similar [[modal logic|modal notions]]. In short: the actual world is regarded as merely one among an [[infinity|infinite]] [[set theory|set]] of [[logically possible]] worlds, some "nearer" to the actual world and some more remote. A proposition is ''necessary'' if it is true in all possible worlds, and ''possible'' if it is true in at least one. To note, however, though the concept does sound similar to modern notions of a multiverse, in reality these two concepts are quite distinct - a multiverse would constitute a single possible world.

== Main tenets ==
At the heart of David Lewis's modal realism are six central doctrines about possible worlds:

# Possible worlds exist – they are just as [[reality|real]] as our world;
# Possible worlds are the same sort of things as our world – they differ in content, not in kind;
# Possible worlds cannot be reduced to something more basic – they are [[Irreducible (philosophy)|irreducible entities]] in their own right.
# [[Modal logic|Actuality]] is indexical. When we distinguish our world from other possible worlds by claiming that it alone is actual, we mean only that it is ''our'' world.
# Possible worlds are unified by the [[Spacetime|spatiotemporal]] interrelations of their parts; every world is spatiotemporally isolated from every other world.
# Possible worlds are [[Causality|causally]] isolated from each other.

== Reasons given by Lewis ==

Lewis backs modal realism for a variety of reasons. First, there doesn't seem to be a reason not to. Many abstract mathematical entities are held to exist simply because they are useful. For example, [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] are useful, abstract mathematical constructs that were only conceived in the 19th century. Sets are now considered to be objects in their own right, and while this is a philosophically unintuitive idea, its usefulness in understanding the workings of mathematics makes belief in it worthwhile. The same should go for possible worlds. Since these constructs have helped us make sense of key philosophical concepts in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, etc., their existence should be accepted on pragmatic grounds.

Lewis believes that the concept of [[alethic modality]] can be reduced to talk of real possible worlds. For example, to say "''x'' is possible" is to say that there exists a possible world where ''x'' is true. To say "''x'' is necessary" is to say that in all possible worlds ''x'' is true. The appeal to possible worlds provides a sort of economy with the least number of undefined primitives/axioms in our ontology.

Taking this latter point one step further, Lewis argues that modality cannot be made sense of ''without'' such a reduction. He maintains that we cannot determine that ''x'' is possible without a conception of what a real world where ''x'' holds would look like. In deciding whether it is possible for basketballs to be inside of atoms we do not simply make a linguistic determination of whether the proposition is grammatically coherent, we actually think about whether a real world would be able to sustain such a state of affairs. Thus we require a brand of modal realism if we are to use modality at all.

== Details and alternatives ==
In [[philosophy]] possible worlds are usually regarded as real but abstract possibilities, or sometimes as a mere [[metaphor]], [[abbreviation]], or ''[[wikt:façon de parler|façon de parler]]'' for sets of [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] [[proposition]]s.

Lewis himself not only claimed to take modal realism seriously (although he did regret his choice of the expression ''modal realism''), he also insisted that his claims should be taken [[literal and figurative language|literally]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By what right do we call possible worlds and their inhabitants disreputable entities, unfit for philosophical services unless they can beg redemption from philosophy of language? I know of no accusation against possibles that cannot be made with equal justice against sets. Yet few philosophical consciences scruple at set theory. Sets and possibles alike make for a crowded ontology. Sets and possibles alike raise questions we have no way to answer.&amp;nbsp;[...] I propose to be equally undisturbed by these equally mysterious mysteries.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis, ''Convention'', 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;How many [possible worlds] are there? In what respects do they vary, and what is common to them all? Do they obey a nontrivial law of identity of indiscernibles? Here I am at a disadvantage compared to someone who pretends as a figure of speech to believe in possible worlds, but really does not. If worlds were creatures of my imagination, I could imagine them to be any way I liked, and I could tell you all you wished to hear simply by carrying on my imaginative creation. But as I believe that there really are other worlds, I am entitled to confess that there is much about them that I do not know, and that I do not know how to find out.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis, ''Counterfactuals'', 1973, pp.&amp;nbsp;87–88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticisms ==
While it may appear to be a simply extravagant account of modality, modal realism has proven to be historically quite resilient{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}. Nonetheless, a number of philosophers, including Lewis himself, have produced criticisms of (what some call) "extreme realism" about possible worlds.

=== Lewis's own critique ===
Lewis's own extended presentation of the theory (''[[On the Plurality of Worlds]]'', 1986) raises and then counters several lines of argument against it. That work introduces not only the theory, but its reception among philosophers. The many objections that continue to be published are typically variations on one or other of the lines that Lewis has already canvassed.

Here are some of the major categories of objection:

* '''Catastrophic counterintuitiveness''' The theory does not accord with our deepest intuitions about reality. This is sometimes called "the incredulous stare", since it lacks argumentative content, and is merely an expression of the affront that the theory represents to "common sense" philosophical and pre-philosophical orthodoxy. Lewis is concerned to support the deliverances of common sense in general: "Common sense is a settled body of theory — unsystematic folk theory — which at any rate we do believe; and I presume that we are reasonable to believe it. (Most of it.)" (1986, p.&amp;nbsp;134). But ''most of it'' is not ''all of it'' (otherwise there would be no place for philosophy at all), and Lewis finds that reasonable argument and the weight of such considerations as theoretical efficiency compel us to accept modal realism. The alternatives, he argues at length, can themselves be shown to yield conclusions offensive to our modal intuitions.
* '''Inflated ontology''' Some&lt;ref&gt;[[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]], ''"Proportional Objects" in Ontological Relativity  and Other Essays', 1969, pp.140-147&lt;/ref&gt; object that modal realism postulates vastly too many entities, compared with other theories. It is therefore, they argue, vulnerable to [[Occam's razor]], according to which we should prefer, all things being equal, those theories that postulate the smallest number of entities. Lewis's reply is that all things are ''not'' equal, and in particular competing accounts of possible worlds themselves postulate more ''classes'' of entities, since there must be not only one real "concrete" world (the actual world), but many worlds of a different class altogether ("abstract" in some way or other).
*'''Too many worlds''' This is perhaps a variant of the previous category, but it relies on appeals to mathematical propriety rather than Occamist principles. Some argue that Lewis's principles of "worldmaking" (means by which we might establish the existence of further worlds by recombination of parts of worlds we already think exist) are too permissive. So permissive are they, in fact, that the total number of worlds must exceed what is mathematically coherent. Lewis allows that there are difficulties and subtleties to address on this front (1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;89–90). Daniel Nolan ("Recombination unbound", ''Philosophical Studies'', 1996, vol. 84, pp.&amp;nbsp;239–262) mounts a sustained argument against certain forms of the objection; but variations on it continue to appear.
* '''Island universes'''  On the version of his theory that Lewis strongly favours, each world is distinct from every other world by being spatially and temporally isolated from it. Some have objected that a world in which spatio-temporally isolated universes ("island universes") coexist is therefore not possible, by Lewis's theory (see for example Bigelow, John, and Pargetter, Robert, "Beyond the blank stare", ''Theoria'', 1987, Vol. 53, pp.&amp;nbsp;97–114). Lewis's awareness of this difficulty discomforted him; but he could have replied that other means of distinguishing worlds may be available, or alternatively that sometimes there will inevitably be further surprising and counterintuitive consequences — beyond what we had thought we would be committed to at the start of our investigation. But this fact in itself is hardly surprising.

A pervasive theme in Lewis's replies to the critics of modal realism is the use of [[tu quoque]] argument: ''your'' account would fail in just the same way that you claim mine would. A major [[heuristic]] virtue of Lewis's theory is that it is sufficiently definite for objections to gain some foothold; but these objections, once clearly articulated, can then be turned equally against other theories of the ontology and epistemology of possible worlds.

=== Stalnaker's response ===
[[Robert Stalnaker]], while he finds some merit in Lewis's account of possible worlds, finds the position to be ultimately untenable.  He himself advances a more "moderate" realism about possible worlds, which he terms '''modal actualism''' (since it holds that all that exists is in fact actual, and that there are no "merely possible" entities).&lt;ref&gt;Stalnaker (1976,1996 both reprinted in Stalnaker 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, Stalnaker does not accept Lewis's attempt to argue on the basis of a supposed analogy with the epistemological objection to mathematical Platonism that believing in possible worlds as Lewis imagines them is no less reasonable than believing in mathematical entities such as sets or functions.&lt;ref&gt;Stalnaker (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kripke's response ===
[[Saul Kripke]] described modal realism as "totally misguided", "wrong", and "objectionable".&lt;ref&gt;Kripke (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Kripke argued that possible worlds were not like distant countries out there to be discovered; rather, we stipulate what is true according to them. Kripke also criticized modal realism for its reliance on [[counterpart theory]], which he regarded as untenable.

'''Nisargadatta Maharaj'''&lt;ref&gt;The American pronunciation of his first name is {{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|ɪ|s|ər|g|ə|ˈ|d|ɑː|t|ə}} {{respell|NISS|ər|gə|DAH|tə}} or {{IPAc-en|n|ᵻ|ˌ|s|ɑːr|g|ə|ˈ|d|ɑː|t|ə}} {{respell|nih|SAR|gə|DAH|tə}}, whereas his last name is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɑː|h|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|dʒ}} {{respell|MAH|hə|RAHJ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɑː|h|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|ʒ}} {{respell|MAH|hə|RAHZH}}&lt;/ref&gt; (17 April 1897&amp;nbsp;– 8 September 1981), born '''Maruti Shivrampant Kambli''', was a [[Hindu]] [[guru]] of [[nondualism]], belonging to the [[Inchagiri Sampradaya]], a lineage of teachers from the [[Navnath Sampradaya]] and [[Lingayat]] [[Shaivism]].

The publication in 1973 of ''[[I Am That]]'', an English translation of his talks in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] by [[Maurice Frydman]], brought him worldwide recognition and followers, especially from North America and Europe.{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=315}}

==Biography==

===Early life===
Nisargadatta was born on 17 April 1897 to Shivrampant Kambli and Parvati bai, in [[Bombay]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://sri-nisargadatta-maharaj.blogspot.in/2014/11/biography-of-nisargadatta-maharaj.html Biography of Nisargadatta Maharaj]&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|reason=we usually avoid blogs|date=January 2017}} The day was also ''[[Hanuman Jayanti]]'', the birthday of [[Hanuman]], hence the boy was named 'Maruti', after him.&lt;ref&gt;[[I Am That]], pp. 6, Who is Nisargadatta Maharaj.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.nisargadatta.in/WebCMS/CMSPage.aspx?PageID=2 S. Gogate &amp; P.T. Phadol, Meet the Sage: Shri Nisargadatta, p. 5 (1972)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[[Samarth Ramdas]] (17th century), the author of the [[Dasbodh]], an important scripture in the Inchegeri Sampradaya, was a devotee of Hanuman.}} His parents were followers of the [[Varkari]] sampradaya,&lt;ref group=web name="Conway-NMB" /&gt; an egalitarian [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] bhakti tradition which worships [[Vithoba]]. His father, Shivrampant, worked as a domestic servant in Mumbai and later became a petty farmer in Kandalgaon.

Maruti Shivrampant Kambli was brought up in Kandalgaon, a small village in the [[Sindhudurg district|Sindhudurga district]] of [[Maharashtra]], with his two brothers, four sisters and deeply religious parents.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.itisnotreal.com/gpage3.html Detailed Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, after his father died, he moved to Bombay to support his family back home, following his elder brother. Initially he worked as a junior clerk at an office but quickly he opened a small goods store, mainly selling [[beedi]]s&amp;nbsp;– leaf-rolled cigarettes, and soon owned a string of eight retail shops.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://advaita.org/AFBmaharaj.htm Sri Nisagdatta bio at advait.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103082346/http://www.advaita.org/AFBmaharaj.htm |date=3 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 he married Sumatibai and they had three daughters and a son.

===Sadhana===
[[File:Siddharamphoto.JPG|thumb|right|Nisargadatta Maharaj met his guru [[Siddharameshwar Maharaj]] in 1933.]]
In 1933, he was introduced to his [[guru]], [[Siddharameshwar Maharaj]], the head of the Inchegiri branch of the [[Navnath Sampradaya]], by his friend Yashwantrao Baagkar. His guru told him, "You are not what you take yourself to be...".&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://vediclife.rvishu.com/Sri_Nisargadatta_Maharaj.html Sri Nisargdatta Quote] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117050313/http://vediclife.rvishu.com/Sri_Nisargadatta_Maharaj.html |date=17 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Siddharameshwar initiated him into the Inchegiri Sampradaya, giving him meditation-instruction and a mantra, which he immediately began to recite.&lt;ref group=web name="Conway-NMB" /&gt; Siddharameshwar gave Nisargadatta instructions for self-enquiry which he followed verbatim, as he himself recounted later:
{{quote|My Guru ordered me to [[Self-enquiry|attend to the sense 'I am']] and to give attention to nothing else. I just obeyed. I did not follow any particular course of breathing, or meditation, or study of scriptures. Whatever happened, I would turn away my attention from it and remain with the sense 'I am'. It may look too simple, even crude. My only reason for doing it was that my Guru told me so. Yet it worked!&lt;ref&gt;[[I Am That]], Chapter 75, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following his guru's instructions to concentrate on the feeling "I Am", he used all his spare time looking at himself in silence, and remained in that state for the coming years, practising meditation and singing devotional bhajans:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://nisargadatta.net/index.html Guru's teachings]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|My Guru told me: "...Go back to that state of pure being, where the ‘I am’ is still in its purity before it got contaminated with ‘I am this’ or ‘I am that.’ Your burden is of false self-identifications—abandon them all." My guru told me, "Trust me, I tell you: you are Divine. Take it as the absolute truth. Your joy is divine, your suffering is divine too. All comes from God. Remember it always. You are God, your will alone is done." I did believe him and soon realized how wonderfully true and accurate were his words. I did not condition my mind by thinking, "I am God, I am wonderful, I am beyond." I simply followed his instruction, which was to focus the mind on pure being, "I am," and stay in it. I used to sit for hours together, with nothing but the "I am" in my mind and soon the peace and joy and deep all-embracing love became my normal state. In it all disappeared—myself, my guru, the life I lived, the world around me. Only peace remained, and unfathomable silence. (I Am That, Dialogue 51, April 16, 1971).&lt;ref group=web name="Conway-NMB" /&gt;}}

After an association that lasted hardly two and a half years, [[Siddharameshwar Maharaj]] died on November 9, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Prior to Consciousness, pp. 1–2, 4 April 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="Conway-NMB"&gt;Timothy Conway, [http://www.enlightened-spirituality.org/Nisargadatta_Maharaj.html ''Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj (1897-1981), Life &amp; Teachings of Bombay's Fiery Sage of Liberating Wisdom''], enlightened-spirituality.org&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, Maharaj left Mumbai and travelled across India.&lt;ref group=web name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.inner-quest.org/NisargadattaSR.htm Sri Nisargdatta bio in innerquest.org]&lt;/ref&gt; After eight months he returned to his family in Mumbai in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[[I Am That]] p.xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; On the journey home his state of mind changed, realizing that "nothing was wrong anymore."&lt;ref group=web name="Conway-NMB" /&gt; He spent the rest of his life in Mumbai, maintaining one shop to earn an income.&lt;ref group=web name="Conway-NMB"/&gt;

===Later years===
Between 1942–1948 he suffered two personal losses, first the death of his wife, Sumatibai, followed by the death of his daughter. He started to give initiations in 1951, after a personal revelation from his guru, Siddharameshwar Maharaj.&lt;ref group=web name="Conway-NMB"/&gt;

After he retired from his shop in 1966, Nisargadatta Maharaj continued to receive and teach visitors in his home, giving discourses twice a day, until his death on 8 September 1981 at the age of 84, of [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.itisnotreal.com/gpage3.html It Is Not Real]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==

===Style of teaching===
Nisargadatta gave talks and answered questions at his humble flat in Khetwadi, [[Mumbai]], where a mezzanine room was created for him to receive disciples and visitors. This room was also used for daily [[chant]]ings, [[bhajan]]s (devotional songs), meditation sessions, and discourses.&lt;ref group=web name="Conway-NMB" /&gt;

Cathy Boucher notes that the Inchagiri Sampradaya emphasized mantra meditation from its inception in the early 19th century, but that the emphasis shifted toward a form of [[Self-enquiry]] with Sri Siddharameshwar.{{sfn|Boucher|year unknown}} Nevertheless,
{{quote|Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj [...] still gave mantra initiation, with the underlying point being that the mantra was more than sound, it was the Absolute Itself which could be reverberated throughout life in all circumstance.{{sfn|Boucher|year unknown}}}}

Boucher also notes that Nisargadatta adopted a different mode of instruction, through questions and answers, for his western disciples.{{sfn|Boucher|year unknown}} Many of Nisargadatta Maharaj's talks were recorded, and formed the basis of ''[[I Am That]]'' as well as of the several other books attributed to him.{{sfn|Nisargadatta|1973}}

===Awareness of true nature===
[[File:Iamthat goethean.jpg|thumb|right|Nisargadatta's "I Am That" in [[Hindi]].]]

According to Timothy Conway, Nisargadatta's only subject was
{{quote|...our real Identity as the birthless-deathless, infinite-eternal Absolute Awareness or Parabrahman, and Its play of emanated universal consciousness. For Maharaj, our only "problem" (an imagined one!) is a case of mistaken identity: we presume to be an individual, and, originally and fundamentally, we are not an individual, we are intrinsically always and only the Absolute.&lt;ref group=web name="Conway-NMB" /&gt;}}

Nisargadatta explains:
{{quote|The life force [prana] and the mind are operating [of their own accord], but the mind will tempt you to believe that it is "you". Therefore understand always that you are the timeless spaceless [[witness]]. And even if the mind tells you that you are the one who is acting, don't believe the mind. [...] The apparatus [mind, body] which is functioning has come upon your original essence, but you are not that apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;The Ultimate Medicine, (pp.54 – 70)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Self-enquiry===
According to Conway, awareness of the Absolute could be regained by
{{quote|... a radical disidentification from the dream of "me and my world" via intensely meditative self-inquiry (atma-vicara) and supreme Wisdom-Knowledge (vijñana or jñana). "I know only Atma-yoga, which is 'Self-Knowledge,' and nothing else.... My process is Atma-yoga, which means abidance in the Self."&lt;ref group=web name="Conway-NMB" /&gt;}}

===Devotion and mantra repetition===
Nisargadatta was critical of a merely intellectual approach to nondual Truth.&lt;ref group=web name="Conway-NMB" /&gt; He had a strong devotional zeal towards his own guru,&lt;ref group=web name="Conway-NMB" /&gt; and suggested the path of devotion, [[Bhakti yoga]], to some of his visitors, as he believed the path of knowledge, [[Jnana yoga]] was not the only approach to Truth. Nisargadatta also emphasized love of Guru and God,{{sfn|Rosner|1987|p=212–218}}&lt;ref group=web name="Conway-NMB" /&gt; and the practice of mantra repetition and singing bhajans, devotional songs.&lt;ref group=web name="Conway-NMB" /&gt;{{refn|group=note| Nisargadatta himself said to a visitor:
{{quote|I may talk Non-duality to some of the people who come here. That is not for you and you should not pay any attention to what I am telling others. The book of my conversations [I Am That] should not be taken as the last word on my teachings. I had given some answers to questions of certain individuals. Those answers were intended for those people and not for all. Instruction can be on an individual basis only. The same medicine cannot be prescribed for all.&lt;br&gt;Nowadays people are full of intellectual conceit. They have no faith in the ancient traditional practices leading up to Self-Knowledge. They want everything served to them on a platter. The path of Knowledge makes sense to them and because of that they may want to practice it. They will then find that it requires more concentration than they can muster and, slowly becoming humble, they will finally take up easier practices like repetition of a mantra or worship of a form. Slowly the belief in a Power greater than themselves will dawn on them and a taste for devotion will sprout in their heart. Then only will it be possible for them to attain purity of mind and concentration.&lt;ref group=web name="Conway-NMB" /&gt;}}}}

===Scriptures===
According to Timothy Conway, Nisargadatta often read Marathi scriptures: Nath saint [[Dnyaneshwar|Jnanesvar]]'s [[Amritanubhava]] and Jnanesvari (Gita Commentary); Varkari Sants, namely [[Eknath]]a’s Bhagavat (''Eknathi Bhagavata'', a rewrite of the ''Bhagavad Purana''), [[Samarth Ramdas|Ramdas]]' [[Dasbodh]]a, and [[Tukaram]]'s poems; but also the [[Yoga Vasistha]], [[Adi Shankara]]'s treatises, and some major [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref group=web name="Conway-NMB" /&gt;

=== Nisarga Yoga ===
Nisargadatta taught what has been called ''Nisarga Yoga''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/811788655|title=I am that : talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj|last=1897-1981.|first=Nisargadatta, Maharaj,|date=2012, ©1973|publisher=Acorn Press|others=Frydman, Maurice, 1900-, Dikshit, Sudhakar S.|isbn=9780893860462|edition= 2nd American|location=Durham, N.C.|oclc=811788655}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Nisarga can be translated as “nature”).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/884814258|title=Nothing Is Everything The Quintessential Teachings of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj.|date=2014|publisher=Zen Pubns|others=Gaitonde, Mohan.|isbn=9789382788973|oclc=884814258}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''I Am That'', Nisarga Yoga is defined as living life with “harmlessness,” “friendliness,” and “interest,” abiding in “spontaneous awareness” while being “conscious of effortless living.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/994000117|title=Living the life that you are : finding wholeness when you feel lost, isolated, and afraid|last=Nic,|first=Higham,|isbn=9781684030859|location=Oakland, CA|oclc=994000117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of this form of [[Yoga]] involves [[Meditation|meditating]] on one’s sense of "I am", "being" or "consciousness" with the aim of reaching its ultimate source prior to this sense, which Nisargadatta called the "Self".

The second edition of ''I Am That'' includes an epilogue titled Nisarga Yoga by Maurice Frydman which includes this passage:&lt;blockquote&gt;“This dwelling on the sense ‘I am’ is the simple, easy and natural Yoga, the Nisarga Yoga. There is no secrecy in it and no dependence; no preparation is required and no initiation. Whoever is puzzled by his very existence as a conscious being and earnestly wants to find his own source, can grasp the ever-present sense of ‘I am’ and dwell on it assiduously and patiently, till the clouds obscuring the mind dissolve and the heart of being is seen in all its glory.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/811788655|title=I am that : talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj|last=1897-1981.|first=Nisargadatta, Maharaj,|date=2012, ©1973|publisher=Acorn Press|others=Frydman, Maurice, 1900-, Dikshit, Sudhakar S.|isbn=9780893860462|edition= 2nd American|location=Durham, N.C.|oclc=811788655}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Nisargadatta did not prescribe a specific practice for [[Self-knowledge (Vedanta)|Self-knowledge]] but advised his disciples, ''"Don't pretend to be what you are not, don't refuse to be what you are."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56487876|title=I am that : talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj|last=1897-1981.|first=Nisargadatta, Maharaj,|date=1999, ©1973|publisher=Chetana|others=Frydman, Maurice, 1900-1976., Dikshit, Sudhakar S.|isbn=8185300534|edition=  4th|location=Bombay|oclc=56487876}}&lt;/ref&gt; By means of [[Self-enquiry (Ramana Maharshi)|self-enquiry]] in the tradition of [[Advaita Vedanta]], he advised, ''"Why don't you enquire how real are the world and the person?''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56487876|title=I am that : talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj|last=1897-1981.|first=Nisargadatta, Maharaj,|date=1999, ©1973|publisher=Chetana|others=Frydman, Maurice, 1900-1976., Dikshit, Sudhakar S.|isbn=8185300534|edition=  4th|location=Bombay|oclc=56487876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nisargadatta frequently spoke about the importance of having the "inner conviction" about one's true nature and without such Self-knowledge one would continue to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/884814258|title=Nothing Is Everything The Quintessential Teachings of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj.|date=2014|publisher=Zen Pubns|others=Gaitonde, Mohan.|isbn=9789382788973|oclc=884814258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nisargadatta claimed that the names of the [[Hindu deities]] [[Shiva]], [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]] were the names of nature (Nisarga) personified,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/884814258|title=Nothing Is Everything The Quintessential Teachings of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj.|date=2014|publisher=Zen Pubns|others=Gaitonde, Mohan.|isbn=9789382788973|oclc=884814258}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that all of life arises from the same [[Nondualism|non-dual]] source or Self. Remembrance of this source was the core of Nisargadatta's message:&lt;blockquote&gt;‘You are not your body, but you are the consciousness in the body, because of which you have the awareness of ‘I am’. It is without words, just pure beingness. It has become soul of the world. In the absence of your consciousness, the world will not be experienced. Hence, you are the consciousness… remember what you have heard… meditate on it. Meditation means you have to hold consciousness by itself. The consciousness should give attention to itself. This consciousness is [[Ishvara|Ishwara]]. As there is no God other than this consciousness, worship it.’ ‘The knowledge “I am” is God. It is Ishwara, as well as maya. [[Maya (religion)|Maya]] is God’s power. All the names of God are of this consciousness only in different forms. Remember the fact “I am not the body” and get firmly established. That is the sign of a true seeker.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Self - Love: The Original Dream (Shri Nisargadatta Maharaj's Direct Pointers to Reality)|last=Gaitonde|first=Mohan|publisher=Zen Publications|year=2017|isbn=9385902830|location=Mumbai|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Seven Principles of Nisarga Yoga (As identified by Nic Higham, 2018)&lt;/u&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nisargayoga.org/|title=Nisarga Yoga|website=nisargayoga.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A less well known disciple is Sri Ramakant Maharaj (born July 8, 1941), who received the naam [[mantra]] from Nisargadatta in 1962, spent the next 19 years with the master.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-xMKkbKc7I Interview with Ramakant maharaj]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="Ramakant"&gt;[http://www.ramakantmaharaj.net/ Shri Ramakant Maharaj]&lt;/ref&gt; and claims to be "the only Indian direct disciple of Shri Nisargadatta Maharaj" who offers initiation into this lineage.&lt;ref group=web name="Ramakant-information"&gt;[http://www.ramakantmaharaj.net/information.php Shri Ramakant Maharaj, ''Information'']&lt;/ref&gt; Sachin Kshirsagar, who has published a series of books on Nisargadatta in the Marathi language&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://sri-nisargadatta-maharaj.blogspot.nl/2015/05/marathi-books-nisargadatta-maharaj.html Marathi books]&lt;/ref&gt; and also re-published ''Master of Self Realization'', says to have received the Naam (Mantra) in a dream from Shree Nisargadatta Maharaj in Oct., 2011.

===Successors===
[[David Godman]] gives the following account of an explanation by Nisargadatta of the succession of Gurus in the Inchagiri Sampradaya:
{{quote|I sit here every day answering your questions, but this is not the way that the teachers of my lineage used to do their work. A few hundred years ago there were no questions and answers at all. Ours is a householder lineage, which means everyone had to go out and earn his living. There were no meetings like this where disciples met in large numbers with the Guru and asked him questions. Travel was difficult. There were no buses, trains and planes. In the old days the Guru did the traveling on foot, while the disciples stayed at home and looked after their families. The Guru walked from village to village to meet the disciples. If he met someone he thought was ready to be included in the sampradaya, he would initiate him with mantra of the lineage. That was the only teaching given out. The disciple would repeat the mantra and periodically the Guru would come to the village to see what progress was being made. When the Guru knew that he was about to pass away, he would appoint one of the householder-devotees to be the new Guru, and that new Guru would then take on the teaching duties: walking from village to village, initiating new devotees and supervising the progress of the old ones.&lt;ref group=web name="Godman" /&gt;}}

According to David Godman, Nisargadatta was not allowed by Siddharameshwar to appoint a successor, because he "wasn't realised himself when Siddharameshwar passed away."&lt;ref group=web name="Godman"&gt;[http://davidgodman.org/interviews/nis1.shtml David Godman, ''Remembering Nisargadatta Maharaj'']&lt;/ref&gt; Nisargadatta started to initiate others in 1951, after receiving an inner revelation from Siddharamesvar.&lt;ref group=web name="Conway-NMB"/&gt; Nisargadatta himself explains:
{{quote|The Navnath Sampradaya is only a tradition, way of teaching and practice. It does not denote a level of consciousness. If you accept a Navnath Sampradaya teacher as your Guru, you join his Sampradaya. Usually you receive a token of his grace - a look, a touch, or a word, sometimes a vivid dream or a strong remembrance.{{sfn|Nisargadatta|1973|p=chapter 97}}}}

'''Noema''' (plural: ''noemata'') derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word νόημα meaning "thought" or "what is thought about."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin and Jiyuan Yu (ed.s) ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2004, p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Husserl]] used ''noema'' as a technical term in [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] to stand for the object or content of a thought, judgement, or perception, but its precise meaning in his work has remained a matter of controversy.

==Husserl's noema==

In ''[[Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology]]'' (1913), Husserl introduced the terms "noema" and "[[noesis]]" to designate correlated elements of the structure of any intentional act — for example, an act of perceiving, or judging, or remembering:

"Corresponding to all points to the manifold data of the real (''reelle'') noetic content, there is a variety of data displayable in really pure (''wirklicher reiner'') intuition, and in a correlative 'noematic content,' or briefly 'noema' — terms which we shall henceforth be continually using."&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Husserl, ''Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'' (also known as ''Ideas I''), trans. W. Boyce Gibson, Collier Books, 1962, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Every intentional act has noetic content (or a noesis — from the Greek [[nous]], "mind").  This noetic content, to which the noema corresponds, is that mental act-process (e.g., an act of liking, of judging, of meaning, etc.) which becomes directed towards the intentionally held object (e.g., the liked as liked, judged as judged, or meant as meant).&lt;ref&gt;Dermot Moran, ''Edmund Husserl: founder of phenomenology'' Polity, 2005, p133&lt;/ref&gt;  That is to say, every act has, as part of its formation, a noematic correlate, which is the object of the act — that which is intended by it.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Husserl, ''Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'' (also known as ''Ideas I''), trans. W. Boyce Gibson, Collier Books, 1962, p229&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, every intentional act has an "I-pole (the origin of the noesis)" and an "object-pole (or noema)."&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Francois Lyotard, ''Phenomenology'', trans. Brian Beakley, SUNY Press, 1991, p55&lt;/ref&gt;  Husserl also refers to the noema as the ''Sinn'' or sense (meaning) of the act, and sometimes appears to use the terms interchangeably.  Nevertheless, the ''[[Sinn]]'' does not represent what Husserl calls the "full noema": ''Sinn'' belongs to the noema, but the full noema is the object of the act ''as meant'' in the act, the perceived object ''as'' perceived, the judged object ''as'' judged, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Dermot Moran, ''Edmund Husserl: founder of phenomenology'' Polity, 2005, p135; see also Edmund Husserl, ''Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'' (also known as ''Ideas I''), trans. W. Boyce Gibson, Collier Books, 1962, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the noema seems to be whatever is intended by acts of perception or judgement in general, whether it be "a material object, a picture, a word, a mathematical entity, another person" precisely ''as'' being perceived, judged or otherwise thought about.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Sokolowski, ''Introduction to Phenomenology'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpreting Husserl==

In fact, commentators have been unable to achieve consensus on exactly what a noema is.  In a recent survey, David Woodruff Smith distinguished four different schools of thought.  On one view, to say that the noema is the intentional object of an act of consciousness is to mean that it quite literally is an object.  Husserl’s student [[Roman Ingarden]], for example, held that both ordinary objects, like chairs and trees, and intentional objects, like a chair precisely as it appears to me, or even a fictional tree, actually exist, but have different "modes" of existence.&lt;ref&gt;David Woodruff Smith, ''Husserl'', Routledge, 2007, pp. 304-305&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative view, developed primarily by Aron Gurwitsch, emphasizes the noema of perceptual experience.  Most ordinary objects can be perceived in different ways and from different perspectives (consider looking at a tree from several different positions).  For Gurwitsch, what is perceived in each such act is a noema, and the object itself – the tree, say – is to be understood as the collection or system of noemata associated with it.  This view has similarities with [[phenomenalism]].&lt;ref&gt;David Woodruff Smith, ''Husserl'', Routledge, 2007, pp. 305-306&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Sokolowski|Sokolowski]], alternatively, holds that a noema is just the actual object of perception or judgment itself, considered phenomenologically.  In other words, the noema of the judgment that “this chair is uncomfortable” is neither an entity (the chair considered as uncomfortable) which exists in addition to the chair itself (but with a different mode of existence) – the Ingarden view; nor is the noema of such a judgment identified with a particular tactile perception of the chair – which along with other perceptions constitutes the chair as such – the Gurwitsch view.  For Sokolowski, the noema is not a separate entity at all, but the chair itself ''as'' in this instance perceived or judged.  This seems consistent with Husserl’s emphasis on the noema as the "perceived as such…remembered as such…judged as such…"&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Husserl, ''Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'' (also known as ''Ideas I''), trans. W. Boyce Gibson, Collier Books, 1962, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Analytic philosopher [[Dagfinn Føllesdal]], in an influential 1969 paper,&lt;ref&gt;Dagfinn Føllesdal, "Husserl’s Notion of Noema" ''Journal of Philosophy'' LXVI:20, 1969, pp. 680-687&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a Fregean interpretation of the noema, which has been developed extensively by Ronald McIntyre and David Woodruff Smith.&lt;ref&gt;David Woodruff Smith and Ronald McIntyre, "Intentionality via Intensions" Journal of Philosophy LXVIII:18, 1971, pp541-561; Ronald McIntyre and David Woodruff Smith, "Theory of Intentionality" in J.N. Mohanty and William R. McKenna (eds) Husserl’s Phenomenology: a Textbook, Center for Advanced Research in Phenomenology and University Press of America, 1989, pp. 147-179; see also David Woodruff Smith, ''Husserl'', Routledge, 2007, especially chapter six.&lt;/ref&gt;  This school of thought agrees that the noema is not a separate entity, but rather than identifying it with the actual object of the act (of perceiving, judging, etc.), phenomenologically understood, this view suggests that it is a mediating component of the act itself.  It is what gives the act the sense it has.&lt;ref&gt;David Woodruff Smith, ''Husserl'', Routledge, 2007, pp. 306-307&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, Føllesdal and his followers suggest that the noema is a generalized version of [[Frege]]’s account of linguistic meaning, and in particular of his concept of [[Sense and reference|sense]] (''Sinn'').  Just as Frege held that a linguistic expression picks out its reference by means of its sense, so Husserl believed that conscious acts generally – not merely acts of meaning but also acts of perception, judgment, etc. – are intentionally directed toward objects by means of their noemata.  On this view, the noema is not an object, but an abstract component of certain types of acts.&lt;ref&gt;David Woodruff Smith and Ronald McIntyre, "Intentionality via Intensions" ''Journal of Philosophy'' LXVIII:18, 1971, pp. 541-542&lt;/ref&gt;

Sokolowski has continued to reject this approach, arguing that "(t)o equate sense and noema would be to equate propositional and phenomenological reflection.  It would take philosophy simply as the critical reflection on our meanings or senses; it would equate philosophy with linguistic analysis." &lt;ref&gt;Robert Sokolowski, ''Introduction to Phenomenology'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert C. Solomon attempted to reconcile the perception-based interpretation of the Gurwitsch school with the Fregean interpretation of noema as sense, suggesting that while "(i)t has now become virtually axiomatic among phenomenologists that the ''Sinne'' [senses] of experience stand independent of the ''Bedeutungen'' [meanings] of linguistic expressions.  It has become all but axiomatic among [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]] that there is no meaning apart from language.  It is the concept of the noema that provides the link between them.  The noema embodies both the changing phases of experience and the organizing sense of our experience.  But these two 'components' are not separable, for all experience requires meaning, not as an after-the-fact luxury in reflective judgements but in order for it to be experience ''of'' anything.”&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Solomon, "Husserl’s Concept of the Noema" in Frederick Elliston and Peter McCormick (eds) ''Husserl: Expositions and Appraisals'' University of Notre Dame Press, 1977, pp. 168-181; see p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
''Noema'' is in the ''[[OED]]'', which has shown its use for more than three centuries. It first was used in English in the field of [[rhetoric]] to denote "a figure of speech whereby something stated obscurely is nevertheless intended to be understood or worked out." In other words, a ''noema'' in rhetoric is obscure speech or speech that only yields meaning upon detailed reflection.

Peacham's 1577 ''Garden of Eloquence''&lt;ref&gt;Peacham's 1577 Garden of Eloquence – Publications from Stockholm University [http://www.diva-portal.org/su/abstract.xsql?dbid=6663]&lt;/ref&gt; used it this way, &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Noema, when we doe signify some thing so privily that the hearers must be fayne to seeke out the meaning by long consideration." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3710">'''Not in Heaven''' (''lo ba-shamayim hi'') is a phrase found in a Biblical verse, {{bibleverse||Deut|30:12|HE}}, which encompasses the passage's theme, and takes on additional significance in [[rabbinic Judaism]].

In its literal or plain meaning, the verse means that God's commands are not overwhelming but rather close to human hearts and abilities to obey. As noted in the ''[[New Oxford Annotated Bible]],'' "The covenant demand is not beyond human reach or understanding but has been graciously revealed... 'the word is near you.'"&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;''New Oxford Annotated Bible,'' Deut. 30:14.&lt;/ref&gt; The full verse states: "It is not in heaven, that you should say, 'Who will go up to heaven for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?'&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; In general, the verse conforms with how "... the deuteronomic tradition believed its [[Torah]] to be an immediately accessible wisdom, neither distant nor wondrous."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Fishbane]], ''Biblical Interpretation in Ancient Israel'', p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jewish interpretations ==

The phrase "not in Heaven" is [[midrash|understood]] to justify man's authority to interpret the Torah. The Talmud explains "[The Torah] is not in Heaven" to mean that the meaning of the Torah itself is to be uncovered not by prophets, or even God's [[miracles]] or words, but by man's interpretation and decision-making. In the story of [[the Oven of Akhnai]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jhom.com/topics/voice/bat_kol_bab.htm |accessdate=2011-06-21 |title=The Oven of Akhnai (Babylonian Talmud, Baba Metzia 59b) |publisher=Jewish Heritage Online Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[Rabbi Yehoshua]] affirmed the independence of man's interpretation from divine intervention since this is what God wills. In support he adduces the biblical statement that the Torah is 'not in heaven' ({{bibleref|Deuteronomy|30:12}})."

In the [[Mishpat Ivri|academic study of Jewish law]], the verse "not in Heaven" serves as the Biblical grounding for the jurisprudential structure of [[halakhah]] (Jewish law). The source for Rabbinic authority is really from {{bibleref|Deuteronomy|17:11}} (According to the law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do). As one author explains, thanks to the [[midrash]]ic reading of the verse, "...God himself acquiesced in His exclusion from the halakhic process. Having revealed His will in Sinai in the ''grundnorm,'' He Himself, according to the Rabbinic explanation, entrusted the interpretation of His will to the Sages."&lt;ref&gt;Roth, p.124. Cp. [[Menachem Elon|Elon]] on the absolute authority of the sages, ch.7:4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Online Consciousness Conference''' held at Consciousness Online &lt;ref&gt;http://consciousnessonline.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2008 by Richard Brown, then a graduate student at the [[CUNY Graduate Center]]. The conference was inspired by and partially modeled on the Online Philosophy Conference &lt;ref&gt;http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/online_philosophy_confere/&lt;/ref&gt; started by Thomas Nadellhoffer and Eddie Nahmias, with one major difference being the heavy use of homemade video and audio presentations, and another difference being the restricted focus of the conference on consciousness studies as opposed to all of philosophy.

==The Conferences==
The first conference was held February 20-March 4, 2009 with the theme "Philosophers Facing Phenomenal Consciousness" and a keynote given by [[David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)|David M. Rosenthal]]. Papers from this conference were subsequently published in the [[Journal of Consciousness Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/jcs_17_3-4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123204645/http://imprint.co.uk/jcs_17_3-4.html |archivedate=2010-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second conference was held February 19-March 5, 2010 with the theme "Lessons and Limits from the Empirical Study of Consciousness" with keynote talks by Hakwan Lau (psychology Columbia) with commentary by [[Ned Block]], David Rosenthal and [[David Chalmers]], and Collin Clifford (psychology University of Sydney). Papers from it are due to be published in [[Consciousness and Cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;http://consciousnessonline.wordpress.com/information-for-contributors/&lt;/ref&gt; The third conference was held February 18-March 4, 2011 with the theme "Neurophilosophy and the Philosophy of Neuroscience" and featured invited talks from [[Paul Churchland]], [[Kathleen Akins]], [[Stevan Harnad]] and [[Jesse Prinz]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17763">'''Open justice''' is a [[Legal doctrine|legal principle]] describing legal processes characterized by [[openness]] and [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]].&lt;ref name="twsNYTimes1"/&gt; The term has particular emphasis in legal systems based on [[Law of the United Kingdom|British law]], such as in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]] such as [[South Africa]] and [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], and former British colonies such as the [[United States]]. The term has several closely related meanings: it is seen as a fundamental [[rights|right]] guaranteeing liberty;&lt;ref name="twsNYTimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsLATimes"/&gt; it describes guidelines for how courts can be more transparent;&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian1"/&gt; and it sometimes identifies an ideal situation.&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsTheAge4"/&gt; In a courtroom, it means steps to promote transparency such as letting the public see and hear trials as they happen in real time,&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; televising trials as they happen, videotaping proceedings for later viewing,&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; publishing the content and documents of court files,&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; providing transcripts of statements, making past decisions available for review in an easy-to-access format,&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsIrishTimes1"/&gt; publishing decisions, and giving reporters full access to files and participants so they can report what happens. The principle includes efforts to try to make what happens in the court understandable to the public and the press.&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian5"/&gt;

In Canada, '''open justice''' is referred to as the [[open court principle]].

==Background==
[[File:Pictures of English History Plate XXIV - King John and Magna Carta.jpg|thumb|right|The principle of open justice has been traced to decisions made before the [[Magna Carta]].]]
The principle is viewed as an underlying or core principle in British law.&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; It has a long history dating back hundreds of years, and it has been traced to decisions made before the signing of the [[Magna Carta]] in 1215.&lt;ref name="twsNYTimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian2"/&gt; Today the concept is so widely accepted that there is a general presumption that there should be judicial openness, such that openness is the rule, with secret or obscured proceedings being considered as exceptions needing to be justified.&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian5"/&gt; The rise of [[social media]] websites such as [[Facebook]] has opened new ways for court cases to be made public; for example, in [[Australia]], courts have considered having websites with live videos as well as blogs by retired judges to "preserve the concepts of open justice" in the digital age.&lt;ref name="twsTheAge"/&gt; In recent years, when governments try to cope with thorny problems such as [[terrorism]], there are concerns that the principle of open justice can be undermined relatively easily by national security concerns.&lt;ref name="twsBBC3"/&gt; There are concerns that if new secrecy guidelines harden into precedents, that it might be hard to restore the "centuries old system of open justice".&lt;ref name="twsBBC3"/&gt;

==Practical considerations==

===Benefits===
Proponents of open justice assert numerous benefits. An overarching benefit is that it keeps courts behaving properly.&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; Openness acts as a safeguard for the proper administration of justice.&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian2"/&gt; According to philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]], open justice is the "keenest spur to exertion and the surest of all guards against improbity."&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian2"/&gt; Knowledge that court trials are regularly public encourages further attendance by the public.&lt;ref name="twsIrishTimes1"/&gt; Further, openness can mean more accurate decisions during a trial; for example, the proceedings can spur a witness to come forth, or encourage others to submit new evidence or dispute publicized statements.&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; Openness reduces the chance that the judgment is a mistake or that a case might have to be re-tried because of a subsequent sanction of contempt.&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; Proponents argue that open justice benefits democracy in a general sense because citizens can see how particular laws affect particular people, and therefore citizens are in a better position to advise lawmakers about such laws.&lt;ref name="twsIrishTimes1"/&gt; It helps ensure public confidence in legal decision-making, according to proponents.&lt;ref name="twsLATimes"/&gt; Proponents of open justice have argued that public scrutiny permits those interested to "tap into the collective wisdom of what passes for fairness in similar cases".&lt;ref name="twsIrishTimes1"/&gt; It facilitates a comparison of cases.&lt;ref name="twsIrishTimes1"/&gt;

A British judge commented:
{{Quote|This is the reason it is so important not to forget why proceedings are required to be subjected to the full glare of a public hearing. It is necessary because the public nature of proceedings deters inappropriate behaviour on the part of the court. It also maintains the public's confidence in the administration of justice. It enables the public to know that justice is being administered impartially. It can result in evidence becoming available which would not become available if the proceedings were conducted behind closed doors or with one or more of the parties' or witnesses' identity concealed. It makes uninformed and inaccurate comment about the proceedings less likely. If secrecy is restricted to those situations where justice would be frustrated if the cloak of anonymity is not provided, this reduces the risk of the sanction of contempt having to be invoked, with the expense and the interference with the administration of justice which this can involve.|Judge Woolf in ''R v Legal Aid''&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt;}}

[[File:A press conference for the Guantanamo Military Commissions.jpg|thumb|right|Governments trying to cope with terrorism have often sought to limit information in trials involving suspected terrorists. Photo: press conference for the Guantanamo Bay military commissions.]]
Still, practical considerations often mean that the ideal of open justice must be weighed against other values such as privacy and cost and national security.&lt;ref name="twsLATimes"/&gt;

===National security concerns===
There are some cases in which [[publicity]] in a courtroom proceeding can be detrimental.&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; In some cases, courts have opted to keep trials secret in proceedings against persons charged with [[terrorism]],&lt;ref name="twsNPR1"/&gt; to protect its intelligence gathering methods and contacts from exposure. In a case in Britain, in which a soldier was on trial for murdering an Afghan insurgent, there was an effort to keep the trial secret to protect him from possible future retribution, but there were calls for the identity of the soldier to be publicized based on the principle of open justice.&lt;ref name="twsBBC"/&gt; In situations when aspects of trials are kept secret, critics favoring open justice have argued that the secrecy is not needed for national security but is "nothing more than a useful drape to cover the inconvenient or the merely embarrassing."&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian2"/&gt; Lawyers have often referred to the principle of open justice when disagreeing with a decision that was made, or calling for a retrial. In the [[United Kingdom]], courts have tried to find the right balance between openness and secrecy, particularly in sensitive cases.&lt;ref name="twsDenverPost"/&gt; In the [[United States]], there have been concerns that the principle of open justice has not been applied to cases of immigrants "wrongly ensnared in the post-9/11 law enforcement dragnet" who were denied access to lawyers and relatives and sometimes deported after secret removal proceedings.&lt;ref name="twsBaltimoreSun"/&gt;

===Privacy concerns===
There are other factors which sometimes must be balanced against the need for open justice. For example, there are situations in which the release of [[confidentiality|confidential information]] such as private financial records might harm the reputation of one of the parties.&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; In other situations, it may be necessary to protect the privacy of a [[Minor (law)|minor]].&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; A further case in which openness is seen as unnecessary are when legal matters involve uncontentious information unrelated to public issues, such as the financial division of an estate after a death.&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; Another factor sometimes working against the ideal of open justice is complexity;&lt;ref name="twsBBC3"/&gt; according to one view, court proceedings over time "have evolved into a complex system that is hard for outsiders to understand."&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian5"/&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Fort Lee lane closure scandal|Bridgegate]] scandal in [[New Jersey]], an appellate judge ruled against releasing the identities of some persons involved in the scandal, on the grounds of being "sensitive to the privacy and reputation interests of uncharged third parties"; that is, releasing names to the media might unfairly tarnish reputations without a trial.&lt;ref name=twsSLedger1&gt;May 17, 2016, Tim Darragh of Advance Media, The Star-Ledger, [http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/names_of_bridgegate_individuals.html Bridgegate names to remain secret for now, court rules], Retrieved September 8, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Another judge commented on tradeoffs which sometimes work against openness:

{{Quote|A hearing, or any part of it, may be in private if publicity would defeat the object of the hearing; it involves matters relating to national security; it involves confidential information (including information relating to personal financial matters) and publicity would damage that confidentiality; a private hearing is necessary to protect the interests of any child or protected party; it is a hearing of an application made without notice and it would be unjust to any respondent for there to be a public hearing; it involves uncontentious matters arising in the administration of trusts or in the administration of a deceased person’s estate; or the court considers this to be necessary, in the interests of justice.|Justice Tugendhat in a legal opinion.&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt;}}

There is an ''Open Justice Initiative'' within the legal community to make justice more transparent.&lt;ref name="twsBostonGlobe"/&gt;

'''Otto Hans Adolf Gross''' (17 March 1877 – 13 February 1920) was an Austrian [[psychoanalyst]]. A maverick early disciple of [[Sigmund Freud]], he later became an [[anarchist]] and joined the utopian [[Monte Verità|Ascona community]]. 

His father [[Hans Gross]] was a judge turned pioneering [[criminologist]]. Otto initially collaborated with him, and then turned against his determinist ideas on character.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Hayman]], ''A Life of Jung'' (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;99.&lt;/ref&gt;

A champion of an early form of [[anti-psychiatry]] and [[sexual liberation]], he also developed an anarchist form of [[depth psychology]] (which rejected the civilising necessity of [[psychological repression]] proposed by Freud). He adopted a modified form of the proto-[[feminist]] and [[neo-pagan]] theories of [[Johann Jakob Bachofen]],&lt;ref&gt;Hayman, p.&amp;nbsp;101.&lt;/ref&gt; with which he attempted to return civilization to a '[[golden age]]' of non-hierarchy. Gross was ostracized from the larger psychoanalytic movement, and was not included in histories of the psychoanalytic and psychiatric establishments. He died in poverty.

Greatly influenced by the philosophy of [[Max Stirner]]&lt;ref&gt;Bernd A. Laska, ''[http://www.lsr-projekt.de/gross.html Otto Gross zwischen Max Stirner und Wilhelm Reich]'', In: Raimund Dehmlow and Gottfried Heuer, eds.: 3. Internationaler Otto-Gross-Kongress, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, München. Marburg, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;125–162, {{ISBN|3-936134-06-5}} [http://literaturwissenschaft.de/ LiteraturWissenschaft.de].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and the political theories of [[Peter Kropotkin]], he in turn influenced [[D. H. Lawrence]] (through Gross's affair with [[Frieda von Richthofen]]), [[Franz Kafka]] and other artists, including [[Franz Jung]] and other founders of Berlin [[Dada]]. His influence on psychology was more limited. [[Carl Jung]] claimed his entire worldview changed when he attempted to analyse Gross and partially had the tables turned on him.&lt;ref&gt;Hayman, p.&amp;nbsp;102.&lt;/ref&gt;

He became addicted to drugs in South America where he served as a naval doctor. He was hospitalized several times for drug addiction, sometimes losing his guardianship of himself to his father in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Heuer, Gottfried. [http://www.ottogross.org/english/documents/BiographicalSurvey.html Otto Gross, 1877-1920, Biographical Survey].&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] drug user from youth, as well as an advocate of [[free love]], he is sometimes credited as a founding grandfather of 20th Century [[Counterculture]].

== Contributions to depth psychology ==

[[Carl Jung]] credited Gross with having described two general types – "inferiority with shallow consciousness" and "inferiority with contracted consciousness" – that very closely resemble what Jung described as the [[extraversion|extraverted]] [[feeling]] and [[introversion|introverted]] [[thinking]] types a decade later. Despite having issues with Gross's theoretical assumptions of a secondary cell function and the "individual" nature of a person's passion, Jung credited Gross with major advances in typological and psychological theory.

In his 1913 work ''A Contribution to the study of Psychological Types'', Jung devoted a paragraph to Otto Gross's contributions.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The relation he [Gross] established between manic-depressive insanity and the type with a shallow consciousness shows that we are dealing with extraversion, while the relation between the psychology of the paranoiac and the type with a contracted consciousness indicates the identity with introversion (Jung, [1921] 1971: par. 879).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Jung's monumental work ''[[Psychological Types]]'', all of chapter VI, ''The Type Problem in Psychopathology'', analyzes and reconciles Gross's theory as expressed in ''Die zerebrale Sekundärfunktion'' (1902) and ''Über psychopathische Minderwertigkeit'' (1903). 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Gross deserves full credit for being the first to set up a simple and consistent hypothesis to account for this [the extraverted] type (Jung, [1921] 1971: par. 466).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In fiction==

Otto Gross, played by [[Vincent Cassel]], is one of the characters in the 2011 [[Historical drama film|historical film]] "[[A Dangerous Method]]", which focused on the relations between [[Jung]], [[Sabina Spielrein]] and [[Freud]]. As depicted in the film, Gross considerably influenced not only Jung's theories but also Jung's private life, helping Jung to shed his inhibitions and start an extra-marital affair with Spielrein, Jung's patient who became his colleague and one of the first female psychoanalysts.

==Death==

Gross died of pneumonia, possibly related to drug addiction, in Berlin on 13 February 1920, after being found in the street, near-starved and freezing.&lt;ref&gt;Heuer, Gottfried.

'''Pathological lying''' (also called '''''pseudologia fantastica''''' and '''mythomania''') is a behavior of habitual or compulsive [[lie|lying]].&lt;ref name=jaapl&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dike CC, Baranoski M, Griffith EE |title=pseudologia lying revisited |journal=The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=342–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16186198 |url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16186198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dike&gt;{{cite journal |first=Charles C. |last=Dike |date=June 1, 2008 |title=Pathological Lying: Symptom or Disease? |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1162950 |volume=25 |issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first described in the medical literature in 1891 by Anton Delbrueck.&lt;ref name=Dike/&gt; Although it is a controversial topic,&lt;ref name=Dike/&gt; pathological lying has been defined as "falsification entirely disproportionate to any discernible end in view, may be extensive and very complicated, and may manifest over a period of years or even a lifetime".&lt;ref name=jaapl/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Defining characteristics of pathological lying include
* A definitely internal, not an external, motive for the behavior can be discerned clinically: e.g., long-lasting extortion or habitual spousal battery might cause a person to lie repeatedly, without the lying being a pathological symptom.&lt;ref name=Dike /&gt;
* The stories told tend toward presenting the liar favorably. The liar "decorates their own person"&lt;ref name="Healy, M. 2004" /&gt; by telling stories that present them as the hero or the victim. For example, the person might be presented as being fantastically brave, as knowing or being related to many famous people, or as having great power, position, or wealth.

Some psychiatrists distinguish compulsive from pathological lying, while others consider them equivalent; yet others deny the existence of compulsive lying altogether; this remains an area of considerable controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Truth About Compulsive and Pathological Liars|url=http://psychologia.co/compulsive-and-pathological-liars/|website=Psychologia|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosing pathological lying can be difficult. Psychologists are trained to understand the issues this diagnosis presents as a disorder. It is listed in the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', third edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = DSM-III and the revolution in the classification of mental illness|journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences|date = 2005-06-01|issn = 1520-6696|pages = 249–267|volume = 41|issue = 3|doi = 10.1002/jhbs.20103|first = Rick|last = Mayes|first2 = Allan V.|last2 = Horwitz|pmid=15981242}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a stand-alone disorder as well as a symptom of other disorders such as [[psychopathy]] and [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]], and [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] [[personality disorders]], but people who are pathological liars may not possess characteristics of the other disorders.&lt;ref name="King BH, Ford CV 1988 1–6"/&gt;

It has been shown through [[lie detector test]]s that PF (''pseudologia fantastica'') patients exhibit arousal, [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], and [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] from their deception. This is different from psychopaths, who experience none of those reactions. People affected by antisocial disorder lie for external personal profit in the forms of [[money]], [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], and [[Power (social and political)|power]]. PF is strictly internal. The difference between [[borderline personality disorder]] and PF is that BPD patients desperately try to [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with their feeling of abandonment, mistreatment, or rejection by making empty threats of suicide or [[false accusations]] of abandonment. Pathological liars do not feel rejected; they have high levels of self-assurance that help them lie successfully. Unlike those with histrionic personality, pathological liars are more verbally dramatic than sexually flamboyant. Narcissists think they have achieved perfection and are [[empathy|unempathetic]] to others. PF patients do not show these anti-social behaviors; they often lie because they think their life is not interesting enough.&lt;ref name="King BH, Ford CV 1988 1–6" /&gt;  The only diagnosis in our current system where purposeless, internally motivated deception is listed is axis I [[factitious disorder]]. This diagnosis deals with people who lie about having physical or psychological disorders. People with PF tend to lie about their identities and past history. Since the symptoms do not match up, the individual may go undiagnosed.{{cn|date=January 2018}} Though they could well be diagnosed under the catch-all rubric of unspecified personality disorder (ICD-10 code F69) or perhaps even better under ICD-10 code F68.8 "Other specified disorder of adult personality and behaviour" as this defines itself as "This category should be used for coding any specified disorder of adult personality and behaviour that cannot be classified under any one of the preceding headings". Here the specified disorder is the lying for psychological reasons (not material ones e.g. money etc.) and the behavior would also need to meet the necessary conditions to be viewed as a [[Classification of mental disorders#ICD-10|psychiatric illness]].

==Psychopathy==
Pathological lying is in Factor 1 of the [[Psychopathy Checklist]] (PCL).&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1529100611426706 |pmid=26167886 |title=Psychopathic Personality: Bridging the Gap Between Scientific Evidence and Public Policy |year=2011 |last1=Skeem |first1=J.

==Pathological liars==
Lying is the act of both knowingly and intentionally or willfully making a false statement.&lt;ref&gt;Lying. (n.d.). Dictionary.com Unabridged. Retrieved September 26, 2011, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lying&lt;/ref&gt; Normal lies are defensive and are told to avoid the consequences of truth telling. They are often white lies that spare another's feelings, reflect a pro-social attitude, and make civilized human contact possible.&lt;ref name="King BH, Ford CV 1988 1–6" /&gt; Pathological lying can be described as a habituation of lying. It is when an individual consistently lies for no personal gain.

There are many consequences of being a pathological liar. Due to lack of trust, most pathological liars' relationships and friendships fail. If this continues to progress, lying could become so severe as to cause legal problems, including, but not limited to, fraud.&lt;ref name="Dike, C. 2008"&gt;Dike, C. (2008).

Sufferers have also shown above average verbal skills as opposed to performance abilities.{{fact|date=June 2017}} Thirty percent of subjects had a chaotic home environment, where a parent or other family member had a mental disturbance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3750">'''Pierre Cally''' (25 September 1630 – 31 December 1709) was a French Catholic [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] philosopher and theologian.

==Life==
He was born at [[Mesnil-Hubert]] near [[Argentan]], now [[Orne]], France. In 1660 he was appointed professor of philosophy and eloquence in the [[University of Caen]], and in 1675, president of the Collège des Arts in the same city. In 1684 he assumed charge of the parish of Saint-Martin. He was an associate of [[Pierre Daniel Huet]], who converted him to [[Cartesianism]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Israel]], ''Radical Enlightenment'' (2001), p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean Renaud de Segrais]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.academiecaen-scabl.com/anglais/celebrite.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Cally died 31 December 1709.

==Works==
He wrote a course of philosophy, ''Universæ philosophiæ institutiones'' (Caen, 1695), in which the theories of [[Descartes]] are explained and defended. He worked for the conversion of Protestants, and gave conferences in which he endeavoured to solve their difficulties. For the same purpose, and in reply to the [[Jesuit]] [[Louis Le Valois]],&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} http://scholasticon.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/Database/Scholastiques_fr.php?ID=299&lt;/ref&gt; he composed a book on the [[Eucharist]], ''Durand commenté, ou accord de la philosophie avec la théologie touchant la transsubstantiation de l'eucharistie'' (Caen, 1700). In it he denies the existence of [[absolute accident]]s and, instead of [[transubstantiation]], admits a transformation. Before and after the consecration the matter of the bread remains the same; by the consecration the matter of the bread becomes the matter of the body of Christ. A publisher in Caen was asked to print sixty copies of the work to be sent to competent judges before making it public. In fact, eight hundred copies were printed immediately and sold. At once the book became the subject of many discussions, and was bitterly denounced. On 30 March 1701, [[François de Nesmond]], [[bishop of Bayeux]] condemned seventeen propositions taken from Cally's work as leading to heresy concerning transubstantiation. Cally made a public retraction on 21 April of the same year.

He also wrote

* "Doctrine hérétique et schismatique touchant la primauté du pape enseignée par les jésuites dans leur collége de Caen" (1644); 
* "Discours en forme d'homélies sur les mystères, sur les miracles et sur les paroles de Notre-Seigneur Jésus-Christ qui sont dans l'évangile" (Caen, 1703),

and published a new edition with commentaries of [[Boethius]]'s work, ''[[De consolatione philosophiae]]'' (Caen, 1695).

'''''Rhododendron canadense''''', the '''rhodora''',&lt;ref&gt;{{PLANTS|id=RHCA6|taxon=Rhododendron canadense|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[deciduous]] [[flowering plant|flowering]] [[shrub]] that is native to northeastern [[North America]].

== Classification ==
Today's [[botany|botanists]] consider the rhodora to be a distant relative of the other [[North America]]n members of its [[genus]], but the difference in floral structure did lead 19th century [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomist]]s to assign the plant its own genus ''Rhodora''. Its closest relative is ''[[Rhododendron vaseyi]]'' from the Appalachian Mountains, which differs in having 7 stamens. DNA sequencing shows that R. vaseyi is not related to R. canadense, but more to R. albrechtii.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhododendron.dk/tree/STAMTRA5.JPG (Hans Eiberg)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
It reaches a mature height of 0.5–1.2 m (approximately 1–3 feet). In early spring, it produces pinkish-purple [[flower]]s in clusters of 2–6 together; each flower is 2–3&amp;nbsp;cm (approximately 1 inch) in diameter, with a five-lobed purple [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]]. The flowers are unusual in comparison with other species of the genus ''[[Rhododendron]]'' found in northeastern North America. Most rhododendrons of the region have tubular flowers with 5 [[stamen]]s each, while ''R. canadense'' has 10 stamens housed inside a [[Floral symmetry#Zygomorphic|zygomorphic]] corolla. The [[leaf|leaves]] open only after the flowers have bloomed and wilted; they are narrow oval, 2–6&amp;nbsp;cm long and 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm broad. When not in flower, it can still be identified by its peculiar, orange-brown [[seed]] cases, 1–1.2&amp;nbsp;cm long.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The wild distribution of the rhodora begins at its easternmost extreme in Canada in [[Newfoundland]] and extends into eastern [[Ontario]] and the United States, where it has its most famous home in [[New England]] and also occurs naturally in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and at high altitudes in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] further south to [[Pennsylvania]]. It thrives in the moist, [[soil pH|acidic soils]] of [[bog]]s, [[swamp]]s, and clearings in [[woodland]]s.

== Culture ==
For a long time, the species was regarded as a botanical icon of New England. The [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] writer [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who spent his life in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], paid homage to it in his [[Poetry of the United States|poem]] "The Rhodora: On Being Asked Whence Is the Flower" (1834, pub. 1847). In this reflective lyric, the poet arrives at the epiphany that the beauty of the rhodora exists not only for its own sake but also discloses the mystical unity of all creation under [[God]]. The poet embraces this unity in his parting words to the rhodora: "The self-same Power that brought me there brought you". The composer [[Mary Lynn Lightfoot]] later set the poem to music in a song of the same name for a women's choir.

''Rhodora'' is also the name of the [[scientific journal|journal]] of the [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-affiliated [[New England Botanical Club]], which is a [[peer review]]ed scientific publication dedicated to the [[flora (plants)|flora]] of North America.

Strange loops may involve [[self-reference]] and [[paradox]]. The concept of a strange loop was proposed and extensively discussed by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', and is further elaborated in Hofstadter's book ''[[I Am a Strange Loop]]'', published in 2007.

A '''tangled hierarchy''' is a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] consciousness system in which a strange loop appears.

== Definitions ==
A strange loop is a hierarchy of levels, each of which is linked to at least one other by some type of relationship.  A strange loop hierarchy is "tangled" (Hofstadter refers to this as a "[[heterarchy]]"), in that there is no well defined highest or lowest level; moving through the levels, one eventually returns to the starting point, i.e., the original level.  Examples of strange loops that Hofstadter offers include: many of the works of [[M. C. Escher]], the ''Canon 5. a 2'' from Bach's Musical Offering, the information flow network between [[DNA]] and [[enzymes]] through [[protein synthesis]] and [[DNA replication]], and [[self-reference|self-referential]] [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödelian statements]] in [[formal system]]s.

In ''[[I Am a Strange Loop]]'', Hofstadter defines strange loops as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And yet when I say "strange loop", I have something else in mind — a less concrete, more elusive notion. What I mean by "strange loop" is — here goes a first stab, anyway — not a physical circuit but an abstract loop in which, in the series of stages that constitute the cycling-around, there is a shift from one level of abstraction (or structure) to another, which feels like an upwards movement in a hierarchy, and yet somehow the successive "upward" shifts turn out to give rise to a closed cycle. That is, despite one's sense of departing ever further from one's origin, one winds up, to one's shock, exactly where one had started out. In short, a strange loop is a paradoxical level-crossing feedback loop. (pp.&amp;nbsp;101-102)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In cognitive science ==
Strange loops take form in human consciousness as the complexity of active symbols in the brain inevitably leads to the same kind of self-reference which [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] proved was inherent in any complex logical or arithmetical system in his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=George|title=A New Journey into Hofstadter's Mind|journal=Scientific American|date=March 2007|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-new-journey-into-hofsta|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel showed that mathematics and logic contain strange loops: propositions that not only refer to [[logical truth|mathematical and logical truths]], but also to the symbol systems expressing those truths. This leads to the sort of paradoxes seen in statements such as "[[This statement is false]]," wherein the sentence's basis of truth is found in referring to itself and its assertion, causing a logical paradox.&lt;ref name="oreilly"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Reilly|first=Scott|title=I Am A Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter|journal=PhilosophyNow|year=2010|url=http://www.philosophynow.org/issue78/I_Am_A_Strange_Loop_by_Douglas_Hofstadter|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofstadter argues that the psychological self arises out of a similar kind of paradox. We are not born with an "I" – the ego emerges only gradually as experience shapes our dense web of active symbols into a tapestry rich and complex enough to begin [[Self-reference|twisting back upon itself]]. According to this view the psychological "I" is a narrative fiction, something created only from intake of symbolic data and its own ability to create stories about itself from that data.  The consequence is that a perspective (a mind) is a culmination of a unique pattern of symbolic activity in our nervous systems, which suggests that the pattern of symbolic activity that makes identity, that constitutes subjectivity, can be replicated within the brains of others, and perhaps even in artificial brains.&lt;ref name="oreilly"/&gt;

== Strangeness ==
The "strangeness" of a strange loop comes from our way of perception, because we categorize our input in a small number of "symbols" (by which Hofstadter means groups of neurons standing for one thing in the outside world). So the difference between the video-feedback loop and our strange loops, our "I"s, is that while the former converts light to the same pattern on a screen, the latter categorizes a pattern and outputs its essence, so that as we get closer and closer to our essence, we get further down our strange loop.&lt;ref name="Hofstadter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hofstadter|first=Douglas|title=I Am A Strange Loop|year=2007|ISBN=978-0-465-03078-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Downward causality ==
Hofstadter thinks our minds appear to us to determine the world by way of "downward [[causality]]", which refers to a situation where a cause-and-effect relationship in a system gets flipped upside-down.  Hofstadter says this happens in the proof of [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorem]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Merely from knowing the formula's meaning, one can infer its truth or falsity without any effort to derive it in the old-fashioned way, which requires one to trudge methodically "upwards" from the axioms.  This is not just peculiar; it is astonishing.  Normally, one cannot merely look at what a mathematical conjecture ''says'' and simply appeal to the content of that statement on its own to deduce whether the statement is true or false. (pp. 169-170)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hofstadter claims a similar "flipping around of causality" appears to happen in minds possessing [[self-consciousness]].  The mind perceives itself as the cause of certain feelings ("I" am the source of my desires), while according to popular scientific models, feelings and desires are strictly caused by the interactions of [[neurons]].

== Examples ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=December 2015}}
Hofstadter points to [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''Canon per Tonos'', [[M. C. Escher]]'s drawings ''[[Waterfall (M. C. Escher)|Waterfall]]'', ''[[Drawing Hands]]'', ''[[Ascending and Descending]]'', and the [[liar paradox]] as examples that illustrate the idea of strange loops, which is expressed fully in the proof of [[Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorem]].

The "[[chicken or the egg]]" paradox is perhaps the best-known strange loop problem.

The "[[ouroboros]]", which depicts a dragon eating its own tail, is perhaps one of the most ancient and universal symbolic representations of the reflexive loop concept.

A [[Shepard tone]] is another illustrative example of a strange loop. Named after [[Roger Shepard]], it is a [[sound]] consisting of a superposition of tones separated by [[octave]]s. When played with the base [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of the tone moving upwards or downwards, it is referred to as the ''Shepard scale''. This creates the [[auditory illusion]] of a tone that continually ascends or descends in pitch, yet which ultimately seems to get no higher or lower. In a similar way a sound with seemingly ever increasing tempo can be constructed, as was demonstrated by [[Jean-Claude Risset]].
{{listen|filename=DescenteInfinie.ogg|title=A Shepard–Risset glissando|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Visual illusions depicting strange loops include the [[Penrose stairs]] and the [[Barberpole illusion]].

A [[quine (computing)|quine]] in software programming is a program that produces a new version of itself without any input from the outside. A similar concept is [[metamorphic code]].

[[Nontransitive dice#Efron's dice|Efron's dice]] are four dice that are [[intransitivity|intransitive]] under gambler's preference. In other words, the dice are ordered A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D &gt; A, where ''x'' &gt; ''y'' means "a gambler prefers ''x'' to ''y''".

The liar paradox and [[Russell's paradox]] also involve strange loops, as does [[René Magritte]]'s painting ''[[The Treachery of Images]]''.

The mathematical phenomenon of [[polysemy]] has been observed to be a strange loop.  At the denotational level, the term refers to situations where a single entity can be seen to ''mean'' more than one mathematical object. See Tanenbaum (1999).

''[[The Stonecutter]]'' is an old Japanese [[fairy tale]] with a story that explains social and natural hierarchies as a strange loop.

'''''The Mind's I: Fantasies and reflections on self and soul''''' is a 1981 collection of essays and other texts about the nature of the mind and the self, edited with commentary by philosophers [[Douglas Hofstadter|Douglas R. Hofstadter]] and [[Daniel Dennett|Daniel C. Dennett]]. The texts range from early philosophical and fictional musings on a subject that could seemingly only be examined in the realm of thought, to works from the twentieth century where the nature of the self became a viable topic for scientific study.

Jeremy Burman, while calling this "a wonderful book", described it as popularizing a non-metaphorical reading of [[Richard Dawkins]]' proposals regarding [[memes]], leading to widespread misunderstanding (in the form of [[memetics]]) and the [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]] of the original idea-as-replicator metaphor.&lt;ref name="misunderstanding"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burman|first1=Jeremy Trevelyan|title=The misunderstanding of memes: Biography of an unscientific object, 1976–1999|journal=[[Perspectives on Science]]|date=May 2012|volume=20|issue=1|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|pages=75–104|doi=10.1162/POSC_a_00057|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

The book's 27 chapters are each made up of a previously published work by authors such as [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Alan Turing]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Raymond Smullyan]], [[John Searle]], [[Stanisław Lem]], [[Thomas Nagel]] (as well as Hofstadter and Dennett themselves), each followed up by a commentary by Hofstadter and/or Dennett. Dennett and Hofstadter both support the idea that we can learn much about human minds and souls by exploring human mentality in terms of  information processing. Dennett and Hofstadter are both proponents of the idea that the wonders of human mentality can be accounted for by mechanical brain processes—which leaves nothing theoretical to prevent us from building human-like mental processes into our mechanical devices. A few views that run counter to this notion, such as [[John Searle]]'s widely known presentation of the [[Chinese room]] argument, are included in this book mainly as targets for refutation.

The book is divided into six sections, each focusing on a particular aspect of the problem of self.

===Part I===
Part I, "A Sense of Self", begins with two works of fiction that challenge the notions of self and identity (including the [[Argentina|Argentine]] writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s "Borges and I"), provoking the reader to think more closely about just what is meant by "self". It closes with an essay by [[Harold J. Morowitz]] on the [[reductionist]] view of the mind.

===Part II===
Part II, entitled "Soul Searching", takes on the idea of soul—that spark which separates thinking beings from unthinking machines. Included here is Alan Turing's famous article from 1950, in which he proposes an operational test—popularly known as the "[[Turing test]]"—for machine intelligence, judged successful if a machine can use human language well enough to pass as human. No machine has yet come close to passing the Turing test, and certainly not at the time of the book's publication. (It is argued that merely behaving as if you have human-like intelligence in no way shows that you have human-like intelligence: see [[Turing test]] for history and criticisms.) As it happens, the two main efforts of [[artificial intelligence]] research towards machine learning since ''The Mind's I'' was published (trainable [[neural net]]s and [[expert system]]s) failed to bring us any closer to true intelligence, so the elusive nature of machine intelligence presented still stands. A dialogue of Hofstadter's own picks up the idea of the Turing test and spins a thought-provoking scenario from it.

Two chapters excerpted from a novel by Terrel Miedaner end the section.  Hofstadter  interprets them in accordance with his own atheistic beliefs, without acknowledgment of Miedaner's opposite intent, which used them to support alternative ideas about the nature of mind and soul.

===Part III===
The formation of mind from elements individually incapable of thought is the central theme of Part III, "From Hardware to Software". The evolution of the mind toward its current state is addressed in the first two reprinted works. Following that is a reprint of "Prelude... Ant Fugue" from Hofstadter's [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]-winning book, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]],'' in which he builds up the metaphor of the mind as anthill: each individual part with only rudimentary function, coming together to be more than the sum of its parts.

===Part IV===
Part IV explores its titular issue, "Mind as Program". What is the self: the mind, or the body? Can they be separated? Can the location of the consciousness be separate from one's physical location. In that case, where are you, really? Dennett's fantastical account of being separated from his brain and David Sanford's response tackle these issues. In this section the mind is considered as software: as patterns of thought and action, as separate from the physical body housing it as a piece of software is from the machine it runs on.

===Part V===
Part V, "Created Selves and Free Will", includes John Searle's notorious "Minds, Brains and Programs" (originally an article published in ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1980), which states: "...mental processes are computational processes over formally defined elements." Searle has objections to the idea that computer programs might ever produce mind, but the idea that mentality involves computation can be traced through the history of Western philosophy where it has long been explored in the context of trying to explain human reason in terms of formal [[logical system]]s. A dramatic and famous rejection of the formal systems idea was that of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], a philosopher whom Dennett respects. After first embracing the idea of reducing everything to logical atoms (''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''), Wittgenstein later rejected the idea that human language games should be formulated as formal systems (''[[Philosophical Investigations]]''). However, many philosophers and artificial intelligence researchers remain captivated by the formal systems approach. For example, Dennett has tried to help the [[MIT Cog project]] develop formal computer programming methods towards the goal of producing human-like intelligence. In his book "Contemporary Philosophy of Mind", [[Georges Rey]] provides an example of continuing attempts to express human intelligence in machines through computational processes over formally defined elements. An alternative but minority approach has grown out of the work of people like [[Gerald Edelman]] and his student [[Olaf Sporns]] through which it is suggested that machine intelligence can most efficiently be achieved by creating autonomous robotic systems that can learn the way human children learn through interacting with their environment.

===Part VI===
The book closes with "The Inner Eye", a collection of short pieces on the subjective nature of experience. How can one describe what it is like to be a particular entity, without actually being it yourself? Thomas Nagel, Raymond Smullyan, Douglas Hofstadter, and Robert Nozick tackle the problem of translating the experiences of one being into terms another can understand. But can we ever know what it is like to be another self? For that matter, what can we know about what it is like to be ourselves? Hofstadter and Dennett's commentary suggest that self-knowledge is elusive, to say nothing of the experience of other minds.

Hofstadter]], first published in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in November 1964; it served as the title essay of a book by the author in the same year.

Published soon after [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Barry Goldwater]] had won the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential nomination over the more moderate [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]], Hofstadter's article explores the influence of [[conspiracy theory]] and "movements of suspicious discontent" throughout [[American history]].

==Background==
The essay was adapted from a [[Herbert Spencer]] Lecture that Hofstadter delivered at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] on November 21, 1963. An abridged version was first published in the November 1964 issue of ''Harper's Magazine'', and was published as the titular essay in the book ''The Paranoid Style in American Politics, and Other Essays'' (1964).&lt;ref name="The Paranoid Style in American Politics, and Other Essays"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hofstadter |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Hofstadter |year=2008 |orig-year= |chapter=The Paranoid Style in American Politics |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=fbRN-7uyqAwC&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Paranoid Style in American Politics, and Other Essays |url= |location=New York |publisher=Vintage Books |page=xi |isbn=9780307388445 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay was originally presented when the [[History of conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], led by [[Arizona]] Senator Barry Goldwater (1909–1998), were on the verge of taking control of the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name="Paranoid" /&gt;

==Historical themes==

===Recurring paranoia in American politics===
In developing the subject, Hofstadter initially establishes that his use of the phrase "paranoid style" was a borrowing from the clinical [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] term "paranoid" to describe a ''political personality'', and acknowledges that the term is pejorative.&lt;ref name="Paranoid"/&gt; [[Psychological projection]] is essential to the paranoid style of U.S. politics.&lt;ref name="Paranoid"/&gt;

==Historical applications==
Historians have also applied the paranoid category to other political movements, such as the conservative [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] of 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John |last1=Mering |title=The Constitutional Union Campaign of 1860: An Example of the Paranoid Style |journal=Mid America |year=1978 |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=95–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hofstadter's approach was later applied to the rise of new right-wing groups, including the Christian Right and the Patriot Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=D. J. |first=Mulloy |title=American Extremism: History, Politics and the Militia Movement |year=2004 |pages=17–34 |chapter=Approaching extremism: theoretical perspectives on the far right in American history |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaBKyuLRjR0C&amp;pg=PA17 |isbn=978-0-415-32674-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Infantile Style in American Politics |first=Gary |last=Kamiya |date=December 5, 2011 |work=Salon |url=http://www.salon.com/2011/12/05/the_infantile_style_in_american_politics/|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political scientist [[Michael Paul Rogin]], in his book ''The Intellectuals and McCarthy: The Radical Specter'' (1967), offered a thorough criticism of Hofstadter's thesis regarding the People's, or Populist, party of the 1890's and similar progressive groups, showing that the ethnic and religious groups that supported Joseph McCarthy and other "paranoid style" figures differ from those which supported the Populists and their successors, and thus that the origins of McCarthyism cannot be found within agrarian radical groups.&lt;ref&gt;https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/165451&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/224541&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Rogin's work, the tendency to conflate left-wing and right-wing populism, ignoring significant differences between the two, continues to be a significant long-term effect of Hofstadter's work.&lt;ref&gt;http://tah.oah.org/february-2016/if-trump-and-sanders-are-both-populists-what-does-populist-mean/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspects of Hofstadter's thesis has been challenged by Samuel DeCanio's 2013 article "Populism, Paranoia, and the Politics of Free Silver," &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=8255529&amp;jid=SAP&amp;volumeId=25&amp;issueId=01&amp;aid=8255527 |title=Studies in American Political Development |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=journals.cambridge.org |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |access-date=August 2, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which argues that instead of being a paranoid delusion, the [[People's Party (United States)|Populists']] position regarding bankers' use of bribes to influence 19th century monetary policy was largely correct.  DeCanio offers evidence that the [[Coinage Act of 1873]], legislation that eliminated [[bimetallism]] and which the Populists' denounced as the "Crime of 73," was influenced by bribes that [[William Ralston]], president of [[The Bank of California]], paid to Henry Linderman, director of the Philadelphia Mint. DeCanio's article includes a copy of the actual check Ralston used to pay Linderman, indicating the Populists' claims were far more accurate than Hofstadter ever suspected.

==Legacy==
In a 2007 article in ''Harper's'', Scott Horton  wrote that "The Paranoid Style in American Politics" was "one of the most important and most influential articles published in the 155 year history of the magazine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=Scott Horton (lawyer) |first=Scott |last=Horton |url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/2007/08/hbc-90000908 |title=The Paranoid Style in American Politics |work=Harper's Magazine |date=August 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laura Miller writes in [[Salon.com]] that  "'The Paranoid Style in American Politics' reads like a playbook for the career of [[Glenn Beck]], right down to the paranoid's 'quality of pedantry' and 'heroic strivings for 'evidence'..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Laura |last=Miller |title=The paranoid style in American punditry |work=Salon |date=September 15, 2010 |url=http://www.salon.com/books/laura_miller/2010/09/15/hofstadter |accessdate=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Technology as a Means to an End".]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Timothy Binkley studied mathematics at [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], earning a B.A. (1965) and an M.A. (1966). His PhD in philosophy, from [[University of Texas at Austin]] (1970), explored [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s use of language.

Binkley has lectured and taught at several colleges and universities in the United States, most notably at [[School of Visual Arts]] where he initiated the MFA Computer Art program, the first of its kind in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater.nytimes.com/library/cyber/mirapaul/111397mirapaul.html "Salon's Digital Art Ends Up Flat."] Mirapaul, Matthew. ''The New York Times'', "Technology | Cybertimes", November 13, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, he founded the New York Digital Salon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydigitalsalon.org/10/essay.php?essay=3 "The Stone Age of the Digital Arts"], Malina, Roger. ''Leonardo.'' New York Digital Salon, 10th Anniversary Catalogue.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franklinfurnace.org/goings_on/past_goings_on/2002/dove_020410.html "Meta-Forms"], Toni Dove, Dolores Zorreguita, et al., ''Franklin Furnace'', April 2002: Colgate University, Hamilton, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; an international exhibition of computer art.

He has exhibited his [[interactive art]] in the United States, Europe, South America, and Asia.

==Philosophy==

Binkley postulates that twentieth-century art is a strongly self-critical discipline, which creates ideas free of traditional piece-specifying conventions including aesthetic parameters and qualities. The artwork is a piece, and a piece isn't necessarily an aesthetic object—or an object at all. Binkley states that anything that can be thought about or referred to can be labeled an artwork by an artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ditext.com/beardsley/1.html [[Monroe Beardsley]] ''Aesthetics: Problems in the Philosophy of Criticism'', 1st ed.], 1958; 2d ed., 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

Binkley argues that the computer is neither a medium nor a tool,&lt;ref&gt;[http://grahameweinbren.net/GW_Papers/Emulating%20the%20ErlKing.html "''The Erl King'' and its Digital Emulation"], Weinbren, Grahame. Martha Kinder and Tara McPherson (eds.), ''Interactive Frictions'', University of California Press, (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesis.lambertsblog.co.uk/?page_id=274 "Computer Art Thesis: A Critical Examination of Computer Art"], Lambert, Nick. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; since both media and tools have inherent characteristics that can be explored through an artist's gestures or physical events for mark-making. Instead, the computer is a chameleon-like or even promiscuous assistant, whose services can be applied to any number of tasks and whose capabilities can be defined endlessly from application to application. Binkley refers to the computer as a non-specific technology and an incorporeal metamedium. Yet the computer contains phenomena not found in other media: namely, a conceptual space where symbolic content can be modified using mathematical abstractions. The notion of an “original” and its consequent value are considered irrelevant, obsolete, or inapplicable to computer art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/61196135/The-problem-of-media-in-contemporary-art-theory-1960--1990 Van Der Meulen, Sjoukje. ''The Problem of Media in Contemporary Art Theory''], (2009): Columbia University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Binkley's philosophy extends beyond art and aesthetics to culture itself, whose foundations he believes we are overhauling through our involvement with computers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h0vnDc2447IC&amp;lpg=PA426&amp;ots=oedvUySRkj&amp;dq=Timothy%20Binkley%20digital%20culture&amp;pg=PA418#v=onepage&amp;q=Timothy%20Binkley%20digital%20culture&amp;f=false Rosen, Philip.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19556">A '''trilemma''' is a difficult choice from three options, each of which is (or appears) unacceptable or unfavourable. There are two [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] ways in which to express a trilemma: it can be expressed as a choice among three unfavourable options, one of which must be chosen, or as a choice among three favourable options, only two of which are possible at the same time.

The term derives from the much older term ''[[dilemma]]'', a choice between two or more difficult or unfavourable alternatives. The earliest recorded use of the term was by the British preacher [[Philip Henry (clergyman)|Philip Henry]] in 1672, and later, apparently independently, by the preacher [[Isaac Watts]] in 1725.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Allan A. |last=Metcalf |title=Predicting New Words: The Secrets of Their Success |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Reference |year=2004 |pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In religion ==
=== Epicurus' trilemma ===
One of the earliest uses of the trilemma formulation is that of the Greek philosopher [[Epicurus]], rejecting the idea of an [[omnipotent]] and [[omnibenevolent]] God (as summarised by [[David Hume]]):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hume |first=David |author-link=David Hume |title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion |year=1779 |quote=Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then is He impotent. Is He able but not willing? Then is He malevolent. Is He both able and willing? Whence then is evil? |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=E7dbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA186&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# If God is unable to prevent evil, then he is not all-powerful.
# If God is not willing to prevent evil, then he is not all-good.
# If God is both willing and able to prevent evil, then why does evil exist?

Although traditionally ascribed to Epicurus and called [[Epicurus' trilemma]], it has been suggested that it may actually be the work of an early [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptic]] writer, possibly [[Carneades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark Joseph |last=Larrimore |title=The Problem of Evil: a reader |publisher=Blackwell |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In studies of philosophy, discussions, and debates related to this trilemma are often referred to as being about the ''[[problem of evil]]''.

===Apologetic trilemma===
{{main|Lewis's trilemma}}
One well-known trilemma is sometimes used by [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologists]] considered a proof of the divinity of [[Jesus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steven T. |last=Davis |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zsqAx7B_TJIC&amp;pg=PA166 |chapter=Was Jesus Mad, Bad or God? |editor=Michael C. Rea |title=Oxford Readings in Philosophical Theology |volume=Volume 1: Trinity, Incarnation, and Atonement |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is most commonly known in the version by [[C. S. Lewis]]. It proceeds from the premise that Jesus claimed to be God, and that therefore one of the following must be true:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=C.S. |year=1952 |title=[[Mere Christianity]] |pages=54–56 |chapter=Chapter 3: The Shocking Alternative |location=London |publisher=Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Lunatic'': Jesus was not God, but he mistakenly believed that he was.
# ''Liar'': Jesus was not God, and he knew it, but he said so anyway.
# ''Lord'': Jesus is God.

The trilemma, usually in Lewis' formulation, is often used in works of popular apologetics, although it is almost totally absent from discussions about the status of Jesus by professional theologians and biblical scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Was Jesus Mad, Bad, or God? |first=Stephen T. |last=Davis |first2=Daniel |last2=Kendall |first3=Gerald |last3=O'Collins |title=The Incarnation: an interdisciplinary symposium on the Incarnation of the Son of God |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |pages=222–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The format was a religious oath to tell the truth, imposed upon the accused prior to questioning. The accused, if guilty, would find themselves trapped between:
# A breach of religious oath if they lied (taken extremely seriously in that era, a [[mortal sin]]),&lt;ref name="rubenfeld" /&gt; as well as [[perjury]];
# [[Self-incrimination]] if they told the truth; or
# [[Contempt of court]] if they said nothing and were silent.

Outcry over this process led to the foundation of the right to not incriminate oneself being established in [[common law]] and was the direct precursor of the [[right to silence]] and non-self-incrimination in the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

== In philosophy ==

=== The Münchhausen trilemma ===
{{main|Münchhausen trilemma}}
In the [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] the Münchhausen trilemma is an argument against the possibility of proving any ''certain'' truth even in the fields of logic and mathematics. Its name is going back to a logical proof of the German philosopher [[Hans Albert]].
This proof runs as follows: All of the only three possible attempts to get a certain justification must fail:
# All justifications in pursuit of ''certain'' knowledge have also to justify the means of their justification and doing so they have to justify anew the means of their justification. Therefore, there can be no end. We are faced with the hopeless situation of an [[infinite regression]].
# One can stop at self-evidence or common sense or fundamental principles or speaking ''[[ex cathedra]]'' or at any other evidence, but in doing so the intention to install ''certain'' justification is abandoned.
# The third horn of the trilemma is the application of a [[circular argument]].

=== {{anchor|Censorship}} The trilemma of censorship ===
In [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[On Liberty]]'', as a part of his argument against the suppression of free speech, he describes the trilemma facing those attempting to justify such suppression (although he does not refer to it as a trilemma, Leo Parker-Rees (2009){{Citation needed|reason=What is the '2009' referring to?|date=August 2018}} identified it as such).
If free speech is suppressed, the opinion suppressed is either:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |author-link=John Stuart Mill |year=1869 |title=On liberty |url=http://www.bartleby.com/130/2.html |location=London |publisher=Longman, Roberts &amp; Green |isbn=1-58734-034-8 |edition=4th |origyear=1859 |accessdate=10 September 2014 |chapter=Chapter II: Of the Liberty of Thought and Discussion |quote=(§1).. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error. .. (§34) .. But there is a commoner case than either of these; when the conflicting doctrines, instead of being one true and the other false, share the truth between them; and the nonconforming opinion is needed to supply the remainder of the truth, of which the received doctrine embodies only a part.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# True – in which case society is robbed of the chance to exchange error for truth;
# False – in which case the opinion would create a 'livelier impression' of the truth, allowing people to justify the correct view;
#Half-true – in which case it would contain a forgotten element of the truth, that is important to rediscover, with the eventual aim of a synthesis of the conflicting opinions that is the whole truth.

== In economics ==

=== "The Uneasy Triangle" ===
In 1952, the British magazine ''The Economist'' published a series of articles on an "Uneasy Triangle", which described "the three-cornered incompatibility between a stable price level, full employment, and&amp;nbsp;... free collective bargaining". The context was the difficulty maintaining external balance without sacrificing two sacrosanct political values, jobs for all and unrestricted labor rights. Inflation resulting from labor militancy in the context of full employment put powerful downward pressure on the pound sterling. Runs on the pound triggered a long series of economically and politically disruptive "stop-go" policies (deflation followed by reflation).&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, "The Uneasy Triangle," ''The Economist,'' August 9, 16, and 23, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Maynard Keynes]] had anticipated the severe problem associated with reconciling full employment with stable prices without sacrificing democracy and the associational rights of labor.&lt;ref&gt;John Maynard Keynes, ''The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money'' (London: Macmillan, 1936), 267; "The Objective of International Price Stability," Economic Journal (June–September, 1943).&lt;/ref&gt; The same incompatibilities were also elaborated on in [[Charles E. Lindblom]]'s 1949 book, ''Unions and Capitalism''.&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Lindblom, Unions and Capitalism (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "Impossible trinity" ===
{{main|Impossible trinity}}
In 1962 and 1963, a trilemma (or "impossible trinity") was introduced by the economists [[Robert Mundell]] and [[Marcus Fleming]] in articles discussing the problems with creating a stable international financial system. It refers to the trade-offs among the following three goals: a [[fixed exchange rate]], national independence in [[monetary policy]], and capital mobility. According to the [[Mundell–Fleming model]] of 1962 and 1963, a small, open economy cannot achieve all three of these policy goals at the same time: in pursuing any two of these goals, a nation must forgo the third.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Obstfeld, Jay C. Shambaugh &amp; Alan M. Taylor (2005). "[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/0034653054638300?cookieSet=1&amp;journalCode=rest The Trilemma in History: Tradeoffs Among Exchange Rates, Monetary Policies, and Capital Mobility]" in ''The Review of Economics and Statistics,'' Vol. 87, No. 3, Pages 423–438. Accessed 13 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wage policy trilemmas ===
In 1989 Peter Swenson posited the existence of "wage policy trilemmas" encountered by trade unions trying to achieve three egalitarian goals simultaneously. One involved attempts to compress wages within a bargaining sector while compressing wages between sectors and maximizing access to employment in the sector. A variant of this "horizontal" trilemma was the "vertical" wage policy trilemma associated with trying simultaneously to compress wages, increase the wage share of value added at the expense of profits, and maximize employment. These trilemmas helped explain instability in unions' wage policies and their political strategies seemingly designed to resolve the incompatibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Peter A. Swenson, Fair Shares: Unions, Pay, and Politics in Sweden and West Germany (Ithaca NY: Cornell University Press, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Pinker social trilemma ===
[[Steven Pinker]] proposed another social trilemma in his books ''[[How the Mind Works]]'' and ''[[The Blank Slate]]:'' that a society cannot be simultaneously "fair", "free", and "equal". If it is "fair", individuals who work harder will accumulate more wealth; if it is "free", parents will leave the bulk of their inheritance to their children; but then it will not be "equal", as people will begin life with different fortunes.

=== The political trilemma of the world economy ===
The economist [[Dani Rodrik]] argues in his book, ''The Globalization Paradox'', that democracy, national sovereignty, and global economic integration are mutually incompatible.

== In politics ==

=== The Zionist trilemma ===

[[Zionists]] have often desired that [[Israel]] be [[Democracy|democratic]], have a [[Jewish identity]], and encompass (at least) the land of [[Mandatory Palestine]]. However, these [[wikt:desiderata|desiderata]] seemingly form an [[inconsistent triad]], and thus a trilemma. Palestine has an [[Arab]] majority, so any democratic state encompassing all of Palestine would likely have a [[binational]] or Arab identity.

However, Israel could be:

* Democratic and Jewish, but not in all of Palestine. 
* Democratic and in all of Palestine, but not Jewish.
* Jewish and in all of Palestine, but not democratic.

This observation appears in "[[From Beirut to Jerusalem]]" (1989), by [[Thomas Friedman]], who attributes it to the political scientist {{ill|Aryeh Naor|he|אריה נאור}}.

== In business ==

=== The project-management trilemma ===
[[File:Project-triangle.svg|thumb|The [[project management triangle]] as a "pick any two" [[Euler diagram]]]]
[[Arthur C. Clarke]] cited a management trilemma encountered when trying to achieve production quickly and cheaply while maintaining high quality.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Clarke, The Ghost from the Grand Banks, (Gollancz, London, 1990), page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[software]] industry, this means that one can pick any two of: fastest time to market, highest software quality (fewest defects), and lowest cost (headcount). This is the basis of the popular [[project management]] aphorism "Quick, Cheap, Good: Pick two," conceptualized as the [[project management triangle]].

=== The trilemma of an encyclopedia ===
The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' is said&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/757969/this-free-online-encyclopedia-has-achieved-what-wikipedia-can-only-dream-of|title=This free online encyclopedia has achieved what Wikipedia can only dream of|date=September 26, 2015|author=Sonnad, Nikhil|work=Scroll.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; to have overcome the trilemma that an encyclopedia cannot be authoritative, comprehensive and up-to-date all at the same time for any significant duration.

== In computing ==
The [[RAID]] technology may offer two of the three desirable value: (relative) inexpensiveness, speed or reliability ([[RAID 0]] is fast and cheap, but unreliable; [[RAID 6]] is extremely expensive and reliable, with correct performance and so on). The phrase "fast, cheap, good: choose two".

It had been [[pastiche]]d in silent computing as "fast, cheap, quiet: choose two".

Further trilemma in computing include the [[CAP theorem]] about guarantees provided by distributed systems, and [[Zooko's triangle]] for naming participants in network protocols.

== In anonymous communication protocols ==
Anonymous communication protocols can offer two of the three desirable properties: strong anonymity, low [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] overhead, low [[network latency|latency]] overhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedom.cs.purdue.edu/anonymity/trilemma/index.html|title=Strong Anonymity, Low Bandwidth Overhead, Low Latency — Choose Two.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anonymous communication protocols offer anonymity at the cost of high bandwidth overhead, that means the number of messages exchanged between the protocol parties is really high. Some offer [[anonymity]] with the expense of latency overhead (there is a high delay between when the message is sent by the sender and when it is received by the receiver). There are protocols which aims to keep the bandwidth overhead and latency overhead low, but they can only provide a weak form of anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough|title=One cell is enough to break Tor’s anonymity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In blockchain ==
The trilemma claims&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buterin|first1=Vitalik|url=https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ|website=Ethereum Sharding FAQ|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buterin|first1=Vitalik|url=https://www.trustnodes.com/2017/11/25/vitalik-buterin-lays-roadmap-ethereum-visa-levels-quadratic-sharding|website=trustnodes|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that blockchain systems can only at most have two of the following three properties:

Decentralization (defined as the system being able to run in a scenario where each participant only has access to O(c) resources, ie. a regular laptop or small VPS)

Scalability (defined as being able to process O(n) &gt; O(c) transactions)

Security (defined as being secure against attackers with up to O(n) resources)

Where c refers to the size of computational resources (including computation, bandwidth and storage) available to each node, and n to refer to the size of the ecosystem in some abstract sense.

== The Trilemma of the Earth ==
{{see also|Renewable energy|Clean energy|World population}}
The ''Trilemma of the Earth'' (or ''3E Trilemma'') is a term used by scientists working on energy and [[environment protection]]. 3E Trilemma stands for Economy-Energy-Environment interaction. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For the activation of [[economic development]] (E: Economy) to occur, we need to increase the [[energy expenditure]] (E: Energy) however this raises the environmental issue (E: Environment) of more emissions of [[pollutant]] gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hamakawa, Yoshihiro|year=2002|title=New Energy Option for 21st Century : Recent Progress in Solar Photovoltaic Energy Conversion|url=http://www.jsap.or.jp/jsapi/Pdf/Number05/07_PastPresentFuture.pdf|journal=Japan Society of Applied Physics International|volume=5|pages=30–35|accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criepi.denken.or.jp/trilemma/index.html|title=Trilemma Council|accessdate=2013-12-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207010034/http://criepi.denken.or.jp/trilemma/index.html|archivedate=2012-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The Žižek trilemma ==
[[File:Zizek trilemma.png|thumb|The Zizek Trilemma illustrates the impossibility of demonstrating loyalty to the Communist regime while also being honest and intelligent.]]
The "Žižek trilemma" is a humorous formulation on the incompatibility of certain personal [[virtues]] under a constraining [[ideological]] framework. Often attributed to the philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]], it is actually quoted by him as the product of an anonymous source:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One cannot but recall here a witty formula of life under a hard [[Communist regime]]: Of the three features—personal honesty, sincere support of the regime and intelligence—it was possible to combine only two, never all three. If one were honest and supportive, one was not very bright; if one were bright and supportive, one was not honest; if one were honest and bright, one was not supportive.&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Žižek [http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3183/ "The Dreams of Others"] In These Times, May 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Yongjia Xuanjue was born in 665 in present-day [[Wenzhou]] in [[Zhejiang|Zhejiang Province]], [[China]]. The city went by the name of Yongjia at the time, and he came to be named for his birthplace later in life. He began studying Buddhism at an early age as a monk in the [[Tiantai]] school and was given the [[dharma name]] Mingdao (明道), meaning "bright path". He was friends with Xuanlang (玄朗), who would go on to become the fifth patriarch of Tiantai. He settled at Lung-hsing temple in Wenzhou, where he remained teaching until his death in 713. He was prominent enough that after his death, the [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] gave him the [[posthumous name]] Wuxiang (無象), meaning 'without phenomena'. His two works that survive today are the ''[[Song of Enlightenment]]'' and the ''Yongjia Collection''.&lt;ref name=Yen/&gt;

==The Overnight Guest==
The story of Yongjia's brief first encounter with [[Huineng]] is recorded in the [[Transmission of the Lamp]].&lt;ref name=Huang&gt;{{citation|title=A Critical Study of Yongjia Xuanjue's Biographies |last=Huang |first=Yi-hsun |journal=The Annual of Research Institute of Buddhist Culture Ryukoku University |volume=33 |year=2009 |page=24 |url=http://repo.lib.ryukoku.ac.jp/jspui/bitstream/10519/717/1/r-bbk-sh_033_003.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613132007/http://repo.lib.ryukoku.ac.jp/jspui/bitstream/10519/717/1/r-bbk-sh_033_003.pdf |archivedate=June 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tale tells of one of Huineng's students encountering Yongjia, and through conversation finding that his opinions were very similar to those of the great Zen teachers of the time. When asked who his teacher was, Yongjia replies that he had none, but rather he had attained his understanding from [[sutra]]s, especially the [[Vimalakirti Sutra]]. Huineng's student then explains that one's understanding should be confirmed, to which Yongjia requests that he testify to his enlightenment. The student states that his own personal opinion is meaningless, and he should instead visit Huineng in Caoxi.&lt;ref name=Sen&gt;{{citation|title=Buddhism and Zen|last=Senzaki|first=Nyogen|last2=McCandless|first2=Ruth S.|publisher= Macmillan|year=1988|isbn= 978-0-86547-315-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving at the temple, Yongjia walks around Huineng three times and then stands staring at him. Huineng comments on his lack of formality, to which Yongjia responds, "Since the question of [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|incessant rebirth]] is a momentous one and death may come at any moment, I have no time to waste on ceremony, and wish you to give me a quick answer to this problem". Huineng suggests he "embody birthlessness" in order to overcome [[impermanence]]. Yongjia immediately displays understanding of this, but then readies himself to leave. Huineng asks if he is not leaving too quickly. Yongjia then says there is no such thing as 'quickly', for motion does not truly exist. Huineng asks why this should be the case, to which he responds that any distinction about quickness or slowness is an artificial construct. Huineng then exclaims that his interlocutor now truly understands the concept of birthlessness, but Yongjia cleverly asks if a mere concept, another form of artificial distinction, can really have a meaning. Huineng asks, "Who makes a distinction about whether there is a meaning or not. Yongjia responds, "Distinctions are meaningless!", and Huineng cries, "Excellent! Excellent! Now, just stay here a single night!" This is so that Huineng can officially confirm his enlightenment. And thus, Yongjia is known as "The Overnight Guest" because he proved his enlightenment to Huineng in one night.&lt;ref name=Fer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sen/&gt;

Despite this story, in the oldest version of the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'' found among the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]], which dates to about 850 CE, Yongjia is not mentioned as a student of Huineng.&lt;ref name=McRae&gt;{{citation|last=McRae|first=John|title=Seeing Through Zen|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press||page=82|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, London|isbn=978-0-520-23798-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
