'''1390 Abastumani''', provisional designation {{mp|1935 TA}}, is a large, rare-type [[asteroid]] from the outer region of the [[asteroid belt]], approximately 101 kilometers in diameter. It was named for the Georgian town of [[Abastumani]].&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

== Discovery ==

It was discovered on 3 October 1935, by Soviet–Russian astronomer [[Pelageya Shajn]] at [[Simeiz Observatory]] on the Crimean peninsula.&lt;ref name="MPC-Abastumani" /&gt; On the same night, the asteroid was independently discovered by South African astronomer [[Cyril Jackson (astronomer)|Cyril Jackson]] at Johannesburg Observatory.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; It was one of the last large-sized bodies discovered in the outer belt ''(also see [[1269 Rollandia]] and [[1902 Shaposhnikov]], discovered in 1930 and 1972, respectively)''.

== Orbit and classification ==

The dark and reddish asteroid is classified as a rare [[P-type asteroid]] in the [[Tholen classification|Tholen]] taxonomic scheme, of which only a few dozens bodies are currently known.&lt;ref name="SBDB-P-type" /&gt; It orbits the Sun at a distance of 3.3–3.6&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 6 years and 4 months (2,326 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.03 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 20[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The first used [[precovery]] was taken at [[Lowell Observatory]] in 1929, extending the asteroid's [[observation arc]] by 6 years prior to its discovery.&lt;ref name="MPC-Abastumani" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

In April 2002, a rotational [[lightcurve]] for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observation by astronomer [[John Gross (astronomer)|John Gross]] at the U.S. ''Sonoran Skies Observatory'' ([[IAU code#G00–G99|G94]]) in Benson, Arizona. It gave a [[rotation period]] of {{val|17.100|0.005}} hours with a brightness variation of 0.15 in [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=2]]}}).&lt;ref name="Gross-2003" /&gt;

According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite [[IRAS]], the Japanese [[Akari (satellite)|Akari]] satellite, and the [[NEOWISE]] mission of NASA's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]], the asteroid measures between 98.3 and 107.8 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has a very low [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] between 0.026 and 0.033.&lt;ref name="AKARI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SIMPS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WISE" /&gt; The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' adopts the results obtained by IRAS, i.e. a diameter of 101.5 kilometers and an albedo of 0.0298.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] is named after the spa town of [[Abastumani]] located in the [[Caucasus Mountains]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. It is now the place where the Abastuman Astronomical Observatory ([[List of observatory codes|code 119]]) is situated ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 838}}).&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

[[File:Eshtemoa menorah.jpg|thumb|200px|Capital depicting a ''[[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]]'' from the [[Eshtemoa synagogue]], [[as-Samu]], [[West Bank]], dating from around the 4th–5th century CE]]
'''Ancient synagogues in Palestine''' refers to [[synagogue]]s in the region commonly referred to as [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], built by the [[Jewish]] and [[Samaritan]] communities from the time of the [[Hasmonean dynasty]] during the Late [[Hellenistic]] period, to the Late [[Byzantine]] period.

== History ==
Most of the synagogues unearthed in [[Archaeology in Israel|archaeological excavations]] in [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]] and the [[Golan Heights]] date from the Roman and Byzantine periods, from the third to seventh centuries. Synagogues from before the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE include [[Gamla]], [[Masada]] and [[Herodium]].&lt;ref name="Levine1998"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lee I.

A survey conducted in the 1970s found that of the known synagogue inscriptions, 67 were in Greek and found in the coastal and major inland cities. Another 54 were in Aramaic, and 14 in Hebrew.&lt;ref name="Levine1975"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lee I.

The earliest synagogue inscription uncovered to date is in Greek and dates to the first century BCE or the first century CE. It was discovered in the [[City of David]], just south of the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem:
:"Theodotos, son of Vettenos the priest and synagogue leader [''archisynagogos''], son of a synagogue leader and grandson of a synagogue leader, built the synagogue for the reading of the [[Torah]] and studying of the commandments, and as a hostel with chambers and water installations to provide for the needs of itinerants from abroad, which his fathers, the elders, and Simonides founded."&lt;ref name="MeyersResearch1997" /&gt;

All of the early synagogues were purpose-built&lt;ref name="KloppenborgWilson1996" /&gt; and many synagogues dating to the [[tannaim|talmudic era]] onwards had annexes attached to the main structure, indicating that synagogues additionally functioned as a communal centres.&lt;ref name="RozenfeldMenirav2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ben Tsiyon Rozenfeld |author2=Joseph Menirav |author3=Chava Cassel |title=Markets and marketing in Roman Palestine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WRQXQKA4W1AC&amp;pg=PA223 |accessdate=7 June 2011 |year=2005 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-14049-3 |page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern-day synagogue architects have relied upon synagogue architecture in ancient Palestine in an attempt to create an "identifiably Jewish style" of synagogue design. The [[Henry S. Frank Memorial Synagogue]] in [[Philadelphia]] was inspired by the remains of the synagogue at [[Kfar Bar'am]].&lt;ref name="Weisberg2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=David E. Kaufman |editor=Ruth Weisberg |title=Jewish Cultural Aspirations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x1LrPQkT1NcC&amp;pg=PA78 |year=2012 |publisher=Purdue University Press |isbn=978-1-55753-635-8 |page=78 |chapter=Modern Architecture and the Jewish Problem: "Jewish Architecture" Reconsidered |quote=...one of the earliest of a growing number of Jewish architects, made direct reference to the archaeological remains of ancient synagogues in Palestine, only recently excavated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second Temple period synagogues ==
Before the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 CE, synagogues served a different purpose that after that event. Several examples of such early synagogues from the time and territory of the [[Hasmonean]] and [[Herodian dynasty|Herodian]] dynasties until 70 CE have been excavated in pre-[[Six-Day War|1967]] Israel, on the [[West Bank]], and one on the [[Golan Heights]]. Some are recognised as synagogues by a larger part of the scientific community, while some are very controversial. They all share only a certain number of architectural characteristics with the better-accepted post-destruction synagogues.&lt;ref name="HachliliBAR"&gt;Rachel Hachlili, [http://cojs.org/synagogues-before-and-after-the-roman-destruction-of-the-temple/  "Synagogues: Before and After the Roman Destruction of the Temple"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704153150/http://cojs.org/synagogues-before-and-after-the-roman-destruction-of-the-temple/ |date=4 July 2018 }}, Biblical Archaeology Review 41:03, May/June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is a list of all the structures from the [[Land of Israel]]/[[Palestine (region)|Palestine region]] discovered as of July 2018 and interpreted by some as Second Temple Period synagogues. The list includes following data:

* [[Qumran]], where the two gathering rooms might be defined as a synagogue  --  around 100 BCE (?)  --  highly contested; if indeed a synagogue: of a sectarian type
* [[Shu'afat]] near Jerusalem  --  structure excavated in 1991 by the late Alexander Onn, who dated it to early 1st century-31 BCE; insufficiently published, some claim the "case evaporated" and the "claim should be withdrawn"

[[File:Trifolium April 2010-2.jpg|thumb|right|White clover is included in some grass seed mixes, because it is a legume that fertilizes the soil]] A '''beneficial weed''' is an [[weed|invasive plant]] not generally considered [[domestication|domesticated]] (however, some plants, such as [[dandelion]]s, in addition to growing wild, are commercially cultivated) that has some [[companion plant]] effect, is edible, contributes to [[soil health]], adds ornamental value,&lt;ref name="Cocannouer_1950"&gt;{{Citation |last=Cocannouer |first=Joseph A. |year=1950 |title=Weeds, Guardians of the Soil |publisher=The Devin-Adair Company |url=http://www.naturalsequencefarming.com/press/Weeds%20guardians%20of%20the%20Soil%20(3).pdf |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or is otherwise [[wikt:benefit#Noun|beneficial]].  Beneficial weeds include many [[wildflower]]s, as well as other weeds that are commonly removed or [[Herbicide|poisoned]].

==Soil health==
[[File:DandelionFlower2.JPG|left|thumb|[[Dandelions]] benefit neighboring plant health by bringing up nutrients and moisture with their deep tap roots]]

Although erroneously assumed to compete with neighboring plants for food and moisture, some "weeds" provide the soil with nutrients, either directly or indirectly.

* For example, [[legumes]], such as [[white clover]], if they are colonized by the right bacteria (Rhizobium most often) add [[nitrogen]] to the soil through the process of [[nitrogen fixation]], where the bacteria has a symbiotic relationship with its hosts roots, "fixing" atmospheric nitrogen (combining it with oxygen or hydrogen) making the nitrogen plant-available (NH4 or NO3).
* Others use deep tap roots to bring up nutrients and moisture from beyond the range of normal plants so that the soil improves in quality over generations of that plant's presence.
* Weeds with strong, widespread roots also introduce organic matter to the earth in the form of those roots, turning hard, dense clay dirt into richer, more fertile soil.
*Some plants like tomatoes and corn will "piggyback" on nearby weeds, allowing their relatively weak root systems to go deeper.

==Pest prevention==
[[File:Alliumvineale1web.jpg|right|thumb|[[Crow garlic]], like any allium, masks scents from pest insects, protecting neighboring plants]]
Many weeds protect nearby plants from insect pests.

Some beneficial weeds repel insects and other pests through their smell,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a905829894&amp;db=all]&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[alliums]] and [[Artemisia (plant)|wormwood]]. Some weeds mask a companion plant's scent, or the pheromones of pest insects, as with [[ground ivy]], as well as [[oregano]] and other [[Mentha|mints]].

Some also are unpleasant to small animals and ground insects, because of their spines or other features, keeping them away from an area to be protected.

===Trap crops===
Some weeds act as [[trap crop]]s, distracting pests away from valued plants. Insects often search for target plants by smell, and then land at random on anything green in the area of the scent. If they land on an edible "weed", they will stay there instead of going on to the intended victim. Sometimes, they actively prefer the trap crop.

===Host-finding disruption===
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|
{{Tone|section|date=September 2018}}
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
{{One source section|date=September 2018}}
}}
Recent studies{{When|date=September 2018}} on host-plant finding have shown that flying pests are far less successful if their host-plants are surrounded by any other plant or even "decoy-plants" made of green plastic, cardboard, or any other green material.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

* First, they seek plants by scent. Any "weed" that has a scent reduces the odds of them finding crop plants. Examples are Crow Garlic (wild chives) and Ground Ivy (a form of wild mint), both dramatically masking both plant scent and insect pheromones. They cut down Japanese beetle infestation, and caterpillar infestation, for example cabbage worm, tomato hornworm, and even squash bugs.
* Second, once an insect is near its target, it avoids landing on dirt, but lands on the nearest green thing. Bare earth gardening helps them home in perfectly on the victim crop. But if one is using "green mulch", even grass or clover, the odds are that they will make what's called an "inappropriate landing" on some green thing they don't want. They will then fly a short distance at random, and land on any other green thing. If they fail to accidentally hit the right kind of plant after several tries, they give up.
* If they plan to lay eggs on the crop, weeds provide one more line of defense: Even if they find the right plant, in order to ensure that they didn't hit on a dying plant or falling leaf, they then make short leaf-to-leaf flights before laying eggs. They must land on the "right kind of leaf" enough times in sequence, before they will risk laying their eggs. The more other greenery is nearby, the harder it is for them to remain on target and get enough reinforcement. Enough "inappropriate landings", and they give up, heading elsewhere.

One scientific study said that simply having clover growing nearby cut the odds of cabbage root flies hitting the right plant from 36% to 7%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/whri/research/integratedpestmanagement/companionplanting/biologist_jun03.pdf] Horticulture Research International, Wellesbourne : "Insects can see clearly now the weeds have gone." Finch, S. &amp; Collier, R. H. (2003). Biologist, 50 (3), 132-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Companion plants==
[[File:Queen Ann's Lace (Daucus carota).jpg|left|thumb|Queen Anne's Lace provides shelter to nearby plants, as well as attracting predatory insects that eat pests like caterpillars, and may boost the productivity of tomato plants]]
Many plants can grow [[intercrop]]ped in the same space, because they exist on different levels in the same area, providing ground cover or working as a trellis for each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ussery |first=Harvey |url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Organic-Gardening/2007-08-01/Plant-Edible-Forest-Garden-Permaculture.aspx |title=Plant an Edible Forest Garden |publisher=Motherearthnews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This healthier style of horticulture is called [[forest gardening]]. Larger plants provide a wind break or shelter from noonday sun for more delicate plants.

===Green mulch===
Conversely, some intercropped plants provide [[living mulch]] effect, used by inhibiting the growth of any weeds that are actually harmful, and creating a humid, cooler microclimate around nearby plants, stabilizing soil moisture more than they consume it for themselves.

Plants such as [[ryegrass]], [[red clover]], and [[white clover]] are examples of "weeds" that are living mulches, often welcomed in horticulture.

==Herbicide==
Repel plants or [[fungus|fungi]], through a chemical means known as [[allelopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/trrkt313p0413g83/ |title= Allelopathic effects of western ragweed on seed germination and seedling growth of selected plants|publisher=SpringerLink |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13 |doi=10.1007/BF00982212 |volume=9 |journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology |pages=1073–1078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific other plants can be bothered by a chemical emission through their roots or air, slowing their growth, preventing seed germination, or even killing them.

==Beneficial insects==
A common companion plant benefit from many weeds is to attract and provide habitat for [[beneficial insect]]s or other organisms which benefit plants.

For example, wild [[umbellifer]]s attract predatory wasps and flies. The adults eat nectar, but they feed common garden pests to their offspring [https://web.archive.org/web/20090421053307/http://www.wildaboutgardening.org/en/gardening-for-wildlife/animals/beneficial-insects].

Some weeds attract [[Coccinellidae|lady beetles]] or the "good" types of [[nematode]], or provide ground cover for predatory beetles.

==Uses for humans==

* Some [[List of beneficial weeds|beneficial weeds]], such as [[Goosefoot|lamb's quarters]] and [[purslane (disambiguation)|purslane]], are edible and highly nutritional. [[Dandelion]]s, a widespread invasive weed, were [[introduced species|introduced]] to North America originally because they were considered a staple source of food; they were admired for maturing quickly and spreading vastly. 
* A number of weeds have been proposed as natural alternate sources for latex (rubber), including [[goldenrod]], from which the tires were made on the car famously given by [[Henry Ford]] to [[Thomas Edison]].
* [[Cocklebur]] and stinging nettle have been used for [[natural dye]]s and medicinal purposes. 
* Some plants seem to subtly improve the flavor of other plants around them, for example, [[stinging nettle]], besides being edible if properly cooked, seems to increase essential oil production in nearby herbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcliving.ca/garden/stinging-nettle-companion-plant-and-medicinal-herb |title=Stinging Nettle: Companion Plant and Medicinal Herb |last=Burnett |first=Bruce |website=BCliving |accessdate=July 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

{{see also|List of companion plants}}

* [[Clover]] is a [[legume]]. Like other [[bean]]s, it hosts bacteria that [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] in the soil. Its vining nature covers the ground, sheltering more moisture than it consumes, providing a humid, cooler microclimate for surrounding plants as a "green mulch". It also is preferred by rodents over many garden crops, reducing the loss of vegetable crops.
* [[Dandelions]] possess a deep, strong [[tap root]] that breaks up hard soil, benefiting weaker-rooted plants nearby, and draw up nutrients from deeper than shallower-rooted nearby plants can access.  They will also excrete minerals and nitrogen through their roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryfarm-lifestyles.com/companion-planting.html|title=Companion Planting for Vegetables &amp; Plants|last=Anon|work=Country living and farm lifestyles|publisher=countryfarm-lifestyles.com|accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Crow garlic]], the wild chives found in sunny parts of a North American yard, has all of the companion plant benefits of other [[allium]]s, including repelling [[japanese beetles]], [[aphids]], and rodents, and being believed to benefit the flavor of [[solanum]]s like tomatoes and peppers. It can be used as a substitute for garlic in cooking, though it may lend a bitter aftertaste.
* [[Bishop's lace]] (Queen Anne's lace) works as a [[nurse plant]] for nearby crops like [[lettuce]], shading them from overly intense sunlight and keeping more humidity in the air. It attracts predatory wasps and flies that eat vegetable pests. It has a scientifically tested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/21275808/The-New-Bionomic-Grower |title=Scribd |publisher=Scribd |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; beneficial effect on nearby tomato plants. When it is young it has an edible root, revealing its relationship to the domesticated [[carrot]].

'''Desembarco del Granma National Park''' ({{lang-es|Parque Nacional Desembarco del Granma}}) is a [[national park]] in south-eastern [[Cuba]], in what is now [[Granma Province]].  The  name of the park means "Landing of the Granma" and refers to the yacht in which [[Fidel Castro]], [[Che Guevara]], [[Raúl Castro]], and 79 of their supporters sailed from [[Mexico]] to Cuba in 1956 and incited the [[Cuban Revolution]]. 

It was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site because of its [[Raised beach|uplifted marine terrace]]s and pristine sea cliffs.

Approximately 330 to 360 million people speak [[English language|English]] as their [[first language]].{{sfn|Crystal|2006|pp=424–426}}
With 258 million native speakers, the [[United States]] comprises the majority of the global total. As pictured in the pie graph below, most native speakers of English are [[Americans]].

Additionally, there are 60 million native English speakers in the [[United Kingdom]], 19 million in [[Canada]], 16.5 million in [[Australia]], 4.8 million in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and 4.8 million in [[New Zealand]]. Other countries also use English as their primary and official languages.

In the [[European Union]], [[English language|English]] is one of 24 official languages and is widely used by institutions and majority of population as native ([[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) and as a second language in other member states.

English is the third [[List of languages by number of native speakers|largest language by number of native speakers]], after [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref name =

Estimates that include [[second language]] speakers vary greatly, from 470 million to more than 1 billion.

==Countries where English is an official language==
{{Main| List of territorial entities where English is an official language}}
In some countries where English is not the most spoken language, it is an [[official language]]; these countries include [[Botswana]], [[Cameroon]] (co-official with [[French language|French]]), [[Eswatini|Eswatini (Swaziland)]], [[Fiji]], [[Ghana]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Kiribati]], [[Lesotho]], [[Liberia]], [[Malta]], the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Mauritius]], the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Namibia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Palau]], [[Papua New Guinea]], the [[Philippines]], [[Rwanda]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Samoa]], [[Seychelles]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Singapore]], the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sudan]], South Africa, [[South Sudan]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. There also are countries where in a part of the territory English became a co-official language, e.g. Colombia's [[San Andrés y Providencia]] and Nicaragua's [[Mosquito Coast]]. This was a result of the influence of [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonization]] in the area.

[[India]] has the largest number of second-language speakers of English (''see'' [[Indian English]]); Crystal (2004) claims that, combining native and non-native speakers, India  has more people who speak or understand English than any other country in the world. However, most scholars and research that has been conducted dispute his assertions.{{sfn|Crystal|2004b}}

English is one of the eleven official languages that are given equal status in South Africa ([[South African English]]). It is also the official language in current [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] of Australia ([[Norfolk Island]], [[Christmas Island]] and [[Cocos Island]]) and of the United States ([[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]] (in Puerto Rico, English is co-official with Spanish) and the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vyQDYqz2kFsC&amp;pg=RA1-PA62

Although the United States federal government has no official languages, English has been given official status by 32 of the 50 [[U.S. state|US state]] governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.us-english.org/inc/official/states.asp |title=U.S. English, Inc |publisher=U.S. English |accessdate=21 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106211903/http://www.us-english.org/inc/official/states.asp |archivedate=6 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.us-english.org/view/1028 |title=U.S. English Chairman Applauds West Virginia Bill to Declare English the States Official Language |publisher=U.S. English |accessdate=23 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401145446/http://us-english.org/view/1028 |archivedate=1 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, per [[United States nationality law]], the process of becoming a naturalized citizen of the US entails a basic English proficiency test, which may be the most prominent example of the claim of the nation not having an official language being belied by policy realities.

Although falling short of official status, English is also an important language in several former colonies and [[protectorate]]s of the United Kingdom, such as [[Bahrain]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Brunei]], [[Cyprus]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].

Books, magazines, and newspapers written in English are available in many countries around the world, and English is the most commonly used language in the sciences&lt;ref name="Graddol"/&gt; with [[Science Citation Index]] reporting as early as 1997 that 95% of its articles were written in English, even though only half of them came from authors in English-speaking countries.

In publishing, English literature predominates considerably with 28 percent of all books published in the world [leclerc 2011]{{Full citation needed|date=June 2014}} and 30 percent of web content in 2011 (down from 50 percent in 2000).{{sfn|Northrup|2013}}

This increasing use of the English language globally has had a large impact on many other languages, leading to [[language shift]] and even [[language death]],&lt;ref&gt;David Crystal (2000) Language Death, Preface; viii, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; and to claims of [[linguistic imperialism]].

The '''etymology of Skye''' attempts to understand the derivation of the name of the island of [[Skye]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]] of Scotland. Skye's history includes the influence of Gaelic, Norse and English speaking peoples, and the relationships between their names for the island are not straightforward. 

The Gaelic name for the "Isle of Skye" is ''An t-Eilean Sgitheanach'' (or ''Sgiathanach'', a more recent and less common spelling). The meaning of this name is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurehistory1620.html | title=Skye: A historical perspective| publisher=[[Gazetteer for Scotland]]| accessdate=1 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various etymologies have been proposed, such as the "winged isle" or "the notched isle"&lt;ref&gt;Mac an Tàilleir, Iain (2003) [http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/language/gaelic/vl-trans.htm#places ''Placenames''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225005529/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/language/gaelic/vl-trans.htm#places |date=December 25, 2010 }}. (pdf) Pàrlamaid na h-Alba. Retrieved 23 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but no definitive solution has been found to date and the placename may be from a [[substratum]] language and simply opaque.&lt;ref&gt;Oftedal, M. (1956) ''The Gaelic of Leurbost''. Oslo. Norsk Tidskrift for Sprogvidenskap.&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, writing in 1549, [[Donald Monro (priest)|Donald Munro]], High Dean of the Isles wrote: "This Ile is callit ''Ellan Skiannach'' in Irish, that is to say in Inglish the wyngit Ile, be reason it has mony wyngis and pointis lyand furth fra it, throw the dividing of thir foirsaid Lochis".&lt;ref&gt;Munro, D. (1818) ''Description of the Western Isles of Scotland called Hybrides, by Mr. Donald Munro, High Dean of the Isles, who travelled through most of them in the year 1549.'' Miscellanea Scotica, 2. Quoted in Murray (1966) p. 146. English translation from [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]]: "This isle is called ''Ellan Skiannach'' in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]], that is to say in English, "The Winged Isle", by reason of its many wings and points that come from it, through dividing of the land by the aforesaid lochs".&lt;/ref&gt;

This was by no means the first written reference. [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources refer to the ''Scitis'' (see the [[Ravenna Cosmography]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmatthews.org.uk/Ravenna_Cosmography/group34.html "Group 34: islands in the Irish Sea and the Western Isles 1"] kmatthews.org.uk. Retrieved 1 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Scetis'' can be found on a map by [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;Strang, Alistair (1997) ''Explaining Ptolemy's Roman Britain''. Britannia. '''28''' pp. 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt; A possible derivation from ''[[Asterisk#Linguistics|*]]skitis'', an early [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word for "winged", which may describe the island's peninsulas that radiate out from a mountainous centre, has also been suggested.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{Haswell-Smith|173-79}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hebridesmap.png|thumb|275px|alt=A map of the island chain of the Hebrides that lie to the west of the mainland of Scotland.|Skye is the northernmost of the [[Inner Hebrides]], coloured red on this map of western Scotland.]]

In the Norse sagas Skye is called ''Skíð'', for example in the ''[[Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120714045019/http://sagnanet.is/saganet/?MIval=/SinglePage&amp;Manuscript=100391&amp;Page=882&amp;language=english "Haakon Haakonsøns Saga"] Norwegian translation by [[Peter Andreas Munch]]. saganet.is. Retrieved 3 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a skaldic poem in ''Saga Magnús konungs berfœtts'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://heimskringla.no/wiki/Saga_Magn%C3%BAs_konungs_berf%C5%93tts "Saga Magnús konungs berfœtts"] N. Linder &amp; K.A. Haggson, eds. heimskringla.no. Retrieved 23 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''[[Heimskringla]]'' from c. 1230.&lt;ref&gt;The poem contains the lines ''Hungrþverrir lét herjat / hríðar gagls á Skíði'', which translate to ‘The hunger-diminisher of the gosling of battle harried in Skye’ or, after interpretation of the [[kenning|kennings]], ‘The feeder of the raven/eagle (i.e., the warrior) harried in Skye’. Kari Ellen Gade (ed.) 2009, ‘Bjǫrn krepphendi, ''Magnússdrápa'' 6’ in Kari Ellen Gade (ed.), ''Poetry from the Kings’ Sagas 2: From c. 1035 to c. 1300''. Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages 2. Brepols, Turnhout, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; According to other authors, it was referred to in Norse as ''skuy'' "misty isle",&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; ''*skýey'', or ''skuyö'' "cloud isle".&lt;ref name=WHM&gt;Murray (1966) ''The Hebrides''.  p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not certain whether the Gaelic poetic name for the island, ''Eilean a' Cheò'' "isle of the mist" precedes or postdates the Norse name. Some legends also associate the isle with the mythic figure of Queen [[Scáthach]].&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, Fiona [http://www.horrormasters.com/Text/a2391.pdf "The Laughter of Scathach the Queen"] (pdf) horrormasters.com. Retrieved 1 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The problems with the proposed Gaelic etymologies can be summed up as follows. Firstly, the Gaelic word for "winged" is ''sgiathach'' and ''sgiathanach'' is not attested in Gaelic except in the place name and the [[ethnonym]] ''Sgiathanach'' "person from Skye". Secondly, the recorded pronunciations all point towards a clear {{IPA|[a]}} preceding the ''-ach'' ending:  {{IPA-gd|ˈs̪kʲiəhanəx|}}, {{IPA-gd|ˈs̪kʲiə.anəx|}}, or {{IPA-gd|ˈs̪kʲi.aːnəx|}}.&lt;ref&gt;Borgstrøm, C. (1941) ''The Dialects of Skye and Ross-shire''. Oslo. Norwegian University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This means the form ''Sgiathanach'' is very unlikely to be based on the Gaelic plural of "wing" (''sgiathan''), which contains a [[schwa]] in the last syllable ({{IPA-gd|ˈs̪kʲiəhən|}}) and would represent a highly unusual adjectival form based on a plural noun. Thirdly, the [[diminutive]]/[[nominalization|nominaliser]] ending ''-an'' would result in {{IPA-gd|ˈs̪kʲiəhan|}}, with a clear {{IPA|[a]}} in the last syllable. This form ''sciathán'' or ''sgiathan'' is indeed attested in the modern Gaelic languages. The [[Old Irish]] attested form is ''scíath'' (cognate with [[Welsh language|modern Welsh]] ''ysgwydd'' "shoulder") with a reconstructed Celtic form *''skeito''-, which suggests the Irish form ''sgiathán'' is an innovation and an unlikely root for ''Sgiathanach''.&lt;ref&gt;MacBain, A. (1911) ''An Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language'' Stirling. Eneas MacKay. 1982 edition by Gairm {{ISBN|0-901771-68-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, deriving the name from ''Scáthach'' involves two main problems: there would be a case of unexplained [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalisation]] of [s̪k] to [s̪kʲ] and an unexplained extra element ''-an-''.

The roots of the Roman and Greek forms, ''Scit-'' and ''Scet-'' (meaning unknown), could be the root of ''Sgitheanach'' as they would regularly develop into Old Gaelic [s̪gʲiθ-] and be an entirely logical source for the attested Norse ''Skíð''. It would also lead to modern ''Sgitheanach'' via a regular suffigation of ''-an'' and ''-ach'' to form an ethnonym and adjective. This would also explain the use of an apparent root form in ''An Cuan Sgith(e)'' [[The Minch]] (the [[strait]] separating the [[Outer Hebrides]] from the [[Inner Hebrides]]) and the older Irish form of ''Scíth'' rather than the modern ''An tOileán Sgiathanach'', for example: ''Do ṡiuḃal sé Scíṫ agus an dá Uiḃeast agus Beinn a’ Ṁaola...'' "He travelled Skye and the two Uists and Benbecula...".&lt;ref&gt;Ó Caḋlaiġ, C. ''An Ḟiannuiḋeaċt'' Oifig an tSoláṫair 1937&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the interpretation of the name as "winged" may simply be a case of [[folk etymology]].&lt;ref&gt;For discussions of phonological development see Borgstrøm (1941), Oftedal, Magne (1956)  ''The Gaelic of Leurbost''. Oslo. Norsk Tidskrift for Sprogvidenskap and McCone, Kim (ed) (1994) ''Stair na Gaeilge: In Ómós do Phádraig Ó Fiannachta''. Coláiste Phàdraig, Maigh Nuad. {{ISBN|0-901519-90-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007 it was reported in the media that the island's official name had been changed by the [[politics of the Highland council area|Highland Council]] to ''Eilean a' Cheò''. However, the Council clarified that this name referred only to one of its 22 wards in the then impending election, and that there were no plans to change signage or discontinue the English name.&lt;ref name=WHM/&gt;&lt;ref name="EaC"&gt;{{cite news| author=Tinning, William| url=http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.1365849.0.0.php| title=Council says Isle of Skye will keep English name| work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]| date=1 May 2007| accessdate=2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''eyecatcher''' is something [[artificial flower|artificial]] that has been placed in the [[landscape]] as a [[wiktionary:Focal point|focal point]] to "catch the eye" or gain a viewer's attention. It is used to decorate or ornament landscapes for [[Aesthetics|aesthethic]] reasons, and are typically found in [[garden]]s, [[park]]s and the grounds of [[stately home]]s. Many of these can be found in various forms.

== Devices or objects ==
These can be anything but typically they tend to be
*[[boulder]]s
*[[rockery]]
*[[tree]] 

Or on a grander scale they can be structures such as a

[[Image:Avatele Niue.jpg|thumb|Avatele, Niue]]
'''[[Niue]]''' is a small [[island]] in the South [[Pacific Ocean]], to the east of [[Tonga]].  It has an area of 260 square kilometres, and a coastline of 64&amp;nbsp;km.  It claims an [[exclusive economic zone]] of 200&amp;nbsp;nm, and a [[territorial sea]] of 12&amp;nbsp;nm.  It is one of world's largest [[coral island]]s.

== Climate ==
Niue's climate is [[tropical]], modified by south-east [[trade winds]].  [[Cyclones]] pose a natural hazard.

== Terrain ==
[[File:Talava arches.jpg|thumb|right|Talava arches, Niue]]
The terrain consists of steep coastal [[cliff]]s made from [[limestone]] and a central [[plateau]].  The lowest point is at sea level, and the highest is an unnamed point near [[Mutalau]] settlement, at 68 m.

== Natural resources ==
The island's natural resources are [[fish]] and [[arable land]].  Land use in 1993 was as in the following table:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+Land use
|-
! Use !! Percentage of area
|-
! arable land
| 19
|-
! permanent crops
| 8
|-
! permanent pastures
| 4
|-
! forests and woodland
| 19
|-
! other
| 50
|-
|}

== Environmental issues ==
A current [[environmental issue]] is increasing attention to [[conservation movement|conservationist]] practices to counter loss of [[soil fertility]] from traditional [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture.  Niue is a party to the following international agreements regarding the environment: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification.  Niue has signed but not ratified the Law of the Sea agreement.

==Boundaries==
Niue has signed a [[Niue – United States Maritime Boundary Treaty|treaty]] with the [[United States]] in which the parties [[boundary delimitation|delimited]] the east–west [[maritime boundary]] between Niue and [[American Samoa]]. Niue is south of American Samoa.

== Extreme points ==

This is a list of the extreme points of [[Niue]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

* Northernmost point – unnamed headland north-west of [[Uluvehi]]
* Easternmost point – unnamed headland south-east of [[Liku]]
* Southernmost point – [[Limufuafua Point]]
* Westernmost point -  [[Halagigie Point]]

The '''Giza Plateau''' ({{lang-ar|جيزة بلاتي}}) is a [[plateau]] that is located in [[Giza]], [[Egypt]]. The famous [[Giza Necropolis]] is located in this geographical area, which is characterized by a sandy, [[desert]] [[climate]] and [[terrain]] with little [[vegetation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hopkins|first1=Daniel J.|title=Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary|date=1997|publisher=Merriam Webster|isbn=978-0877795469|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The general elevation is just over 3,000 ft above sea level but the highest points on it rise to 5,077 and 4,293."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ibis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ML5HAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA206|volume=2|year=1906|publisher=British Ornithologists' Union (United Kingdom)|pages=206–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient findings==
The plateau has many tombs. One of the people working on clearing the sands from around the Great Sphinx was [[Eugène Grébaut]], a French Director of the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities|Antiquities Service]]&lt;ref name="SCAHistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA): 1858 to present|url=http://www.sca-egypt.org/eng/sca_history.htm|website=SCA – Egypt|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017043511/http://www.sca-egypt.org/eng/SCA_History.htm|archivedate=2016-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In the beginning of the year 1887, the chest, the paws, the altar, and plateau were all made visible. Flights of steps were unearthed, and finally accurate measurements were taken of the great figures. The height from the lowest of the steps was found to be one hundred feet, and the space between the paws was found to be thirty-five feet long and ten feet wide. Here there was formerly an altar; and a stele of [[Thutmose IV]] was discovered, recording a dream in which he was ordered to clear away the sand that even then was gathering round the site of the Sphinx."&lt;ref name="HistoryofEgypt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rappoport|first1=S.|title=The Project Gutenberg EBook of History Of Egypt From 330 B.C.

They cross the [[Nile River]] from the east bank and follow the causeway westward. Dominating the plateau and running in a southwest diagonal through the site are the three pyramids of the [[Pharaoh|pharaohs]] Khufu, [[Khafra]], and [[Menkaura]]. The northernmost, and the largest, one belongs to Khufu. Khafra's pyramid is built precisely on a southwest diagonal to his father's pyramid, as well as having been built on higher ground to create the illusion of being bigger. The pyramid of Menkaura is much smaller and is not aligned along the same diagonal line as the other two pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Egypt, Land and lives of the pharaohs revealed|publisher=Global Book Publishing|isbn=1 74048 056 2|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a clear day the Pyramids of [[Abusir]] can be seen from the Giza Plateau.&lt;ref name="TravelersGuide" /&gt;  It is a place attractive to tourists, researchers and adherents of [[New Age]].&lt;ref name="Womb"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prakasha|first1=Anaiya Aon|last2=Prakasha|first2=Padma Aon|title=Womb Wisdom: Awakening the Creative and Forgotten Powers of the Feminine|date=2011|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co,|isbn=9781594778247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldSIzzNlIooC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=giza+plateau&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcn5CSpYbQAhUC7CYKHfckAjw4WhDoAQgjMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=giza%20plateau&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewAge2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malkowski|first1=Edward F.|title=Return of the Golden Age: Ancient History and the Key to Our Collective Future|date=2013|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co,|isbn=9781620551981|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yHJnAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=giza+plateau,+barren&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stout shoes or jogging shoes are recommended for visitors to the plateau.&lt;ref name="TravelersGuide"&gt;{{cite book|last1=West|first1=John Anthony|title=The Traveler's Key to Ancient Egypt: A Guide to the Sacred Places of Ancient Egypt (pg 150)|date=1995|publisher=Quest Books|isbn=9780835607247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EG0BzbCu0m4C&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=giza+plateau&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAncCzoIbQAhWMNSYKHTg1CzQQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=giza%20plateau&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{confuse|Fertile Crescent}}
[[Image:HeroinWorld-en.svg|thumb|320px|Map showing heroin production regions]]

The '''Golden Crescent''' is the name given to one of [[Asia]]'s two principal areas of [[Illegal drug trade|illicit]] [[opium]] production (with the other being the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]]), located at the crossroads of [[Central Asia|Central]], [[South Asia|South]], and [[Western Asia]]. This space overlaps three nations, [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]], and [[Pakistan]], whose mountainous peripheries define the crescent.

The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC) [[heroin]] production estimates for the past 10 years show significant changes in the primary source areas. In 1991, Afghanistan became the world's primary opium producer, with a yield of 1,782 [[metric ton]]s (U.S. State Department estimates), surpassing [[Myanmar]], formerly the world leader in opium production. The decrease in heroin production from Myanmar is the result of several years of unfavorable growing conditions and new government policies of forced eradication.&lt;ref name=Interpol&gt;{{cite web | title = Interpol: Drugs Sub-Directorate: Heroin | url = http://www.interpol.com/Public/Drugs/heroin/default.asp | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-07-05 | publisher = [[Interpol]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghan heroin production increased during the same time frame, with a notable decrease in 2001 allegedly as a result of the [[Taliban]]'s [[fatwa]] against heroin production.&lt;ref name=Interpol/&gt; Afghanistan now produces [[Opium production in Afghanistan|over 90% of the world's ''non-pharmaceutical-grade'' opium]].&lt;ref name=Interpol/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iris.tas.gov.au/resource_industry/agriculture/supply/other_crops |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325031944/http://www.iris.tas.gov.au/resource_industry/agriculture/supply/other_crops |archivedate=2012-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[opiate]]s, Afghanistan is also the world's largest producer of [[hashish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id%3D122108%26sectionid%3D351020403 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530055538/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=122108&amp;sectionid=351020403 |archivedate=2013-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/03/31/afghanistan-leading-hashish-producer/ | work=Fox News | title=UN: Afghanistan is leading hashish producer | date=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Black tar (raw) opium seized in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|right|Black tar opium seized in Afghanistan, spring 2005]]

The Golden Crescent has a much longer history of opium production than does Southeast Asia's Golden Triangle. The Golden Triangle emerged as a modern-day opium-producing entity only in the 1980s, after the Golden Crescent did so in the 1950s. The Golden Triangle began making an impact on the opium and morphine market in the 1980s and has steadily increased its output since then in order to match the increasing demand. During the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, a retaliation to the [[September 11th terrorist attacks]], the Golden Crescent’s opium production took a huge hit, producing almost 90% less opium than in 2000.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;{{cite web|title=Drug Trafficking|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/drug-trafficking/index.html|publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

At the peak of its opium production in 2007, the Golden Crescent produced more than 8,000 of the world’s almost 9,000 total tons of opium, a near [[monopoly]].&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt;  The Golden Crescent also dominates the cannabis resin market due to the high resin yields of the region (145 kg/ha), four times more than Morocco (36 kg/ha).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/03/3/afghanistan-leading-hashish-producer/|title = Afghanistan is Leading Hashish Producer|publisher = Fox News|accessdate = 21 May 2012}} {{Dead link|date = September 2013|bot = RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Golden Crescent also caters to a much larger market, about 64% more than the Golden Triangle. It produces and distributes over 2,500 tons of opiates to Africa, Europe, the Americas and Central Asia and supplies almost 9.5 million opiate users worldwide. 

Despite worldwide efforts to capture and seize as much opium product as possible, total opiate seizures only brought in 23.5% of the total estimated product distributed worldwide.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt;  Of these seizures around 97% of opium and morphine seizures are made in the Middle East and heroin seizures are made mostly in the Middle East or Europe. In Afghanistan only one percent of the heroin that is exported illegally is intercepted and destroyed by the national governments. Although Afghanistan is the major producer of opiates in the Golden Crescent, most of the seizures are made in Iran, their neighbor to the west. This is because traffickers are arrested while crossing the border from Afghanistan to Iran so that they can distribute the product to Europe and Africa where there is a high demand for opiates.  In Pakistan the majority of traffickers arrested are 38% Nigerians and 32% Pakistanis.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt;  

These traffickers, essential to the transportation of the drugs from the source to end-user markets, make large profits because of how risky the job is. A rough estimate of how many people are currently involved in drug trafficking is above one million. The majority of opium produced in Afghanistan comes from the Kandahar and Helmand provinces, Helmand being the major producer. Of the 5,300 tons of opium produced in Afghanistan, 2,700 tons is transformed into heroin.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt;  In 2008, almost half of the heroin produced was used in Iran. Even though Afghanistan is the leading producer, only 7% was used there.

==Markets==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Although the Golden Triangle heroin dominates the Asian illegal drug markets, the Golden Crescent is increasingly becoming a source of illicit drugs trafficked into western China, particularly the nearby [[Xinjiang]] Province.&lt;ref name=Interpol/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2597">The '''Kyl–Bingaman Amendment''' (Public Law 104-201, Section 1064) is a United States law. It was put into force by the Military Defense [[National Defense Authorization Act]] for 1997.

This provision prohibits US authorities from granting a license for collecting or disseminating high resolution [[satellite imagery]] of [[Israel]] at a higher resolution than available from other commercial sources (i.e. companies outside of the United States), unless this is done by a [[List of federal agencies in the United States|US federal agency]], or if it is done in order to abolish the secrecy of such recordings.

The amendment is named after [[United States Senator]]s [[Jon Kyl]] and [[Jeff Bingaman]].

In August 2017 the Advisory Committee on Commercial Remote Sensing (ACCRES), part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) which regulates the Kyl-Bingaman Amendment restrictions, announced a review of the current imagery resolution limit of 2m Ground Sampling Distance (GSD). This was done in response to evidence that commercial satellite companies outside the United States were selling imagery below that limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ACCRES|title=ACCRES 22nd Meeting Minutes Final|url=https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/CRSRA/files/ACCRES_22nd_Meeting_Minutes_Final.pdf|website=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=26 April 2018|date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imagery of higher resolution that the 2m GSD limitation has been commercially available from companies outside of the United States since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zerbini|first1=Andrea|last2=Fradley|first2=Michael|title=Higher resolution satellite imagery of Israel and Palestine: Re-assessing the Kyl-Bingaman Amendment|journal=Space Policy|date=2018|doi=10.1016/j.spacepol.2018.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15159">'''Lineated valley fill''' (LVF), also called '''lineated floor deposit''', is a feature of the floors of some channels on [[Mars]], exhibiting ridges and grooves that seem to flow around obstacles. Shadow measurements show that at least some of the ridges are several metres high. LVF is believed to be ice-rich.&lt;ref name="obliq"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Head, J., et al.  2006.

Abstract 1127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Noach"/&gt;  The debris consists of wind-borne dust, material from alcove walls, and lag material remaining after ice [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimated]] (changed from a solid directly to a gas) from a rock-ice mixture. Some [[glacier]]s on Earth show similar ridges.  High-resolution pictures taken with [[HiRISE]] reveal that some of the surfaces of lineated valley fill are covered with strange patterns called closed-cell and open-cell [[brain terrain]].  The terrain resembles a human brain.  It is believed to be caused by cracks in the surface accumulating dust and other debris, together with ice sublimating from some of the surfaces.  The cracks are the result stress from gravity and seasonal heating and cooling.&lt;ref&gt;Mellon, M.  1997.

Lineated floor deposits began as [[lobate debris apron]]s (LDAs), which form as material leaves narrow mountain valleys and spreads out as an apron.&lt;ref name="Souness, C 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Souness C., Hubbard B. | year = 2013 | title = An alternative interpretation of late Amazonian ice flow: Protonilus Mensae, Mars | url = | journal = Icarus | volume = 225 | issue = | pages = 495–505 | doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2013.03.030 | bibcode=2013Icar..225..495S}}&lt;/ref&gt; By tracing the paths of the ridges on LDAs, researchers have come to believe that the curved ridges characteristic of lobate debris aprons straighten out to form the more or less straight ridges of LVF.&lt;ref name="Noach"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Head, J.  |author2=D.

In the regions where LVF and LDAs occur, many craters have [[concentric crater fill]]: large ridges and other surfaces nicknamed brain terrain, after the surface corrugations of the human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Levy, J. | date = 2009 | title = Concentric crater fill in Utopia Planitia:  History and interaction between glacial "brain terrain" and periglacial processes | journal = Icarus | volume = 202 | pages = 462–476 | doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2009.02.018 | bibcode=2009Icar..202..462L | issue = 2| last2 = Head | first2 = James W. | last3 = Marchant | first3 = David R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of lineated valley fill and other features related to debris-covered ice has been greatly aided by the abundance of data received from Mars orbiting instruments. Excellent images have been obtained from [[THEMIS]], [[Mars Orbiter Camera|MOC]], [[CTX (camera)|CTX]], and [[HiRISE]]. Detailed altimetry was collected by [[Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter|MOLA]].

The [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'s Shallow Radar gave a strong reflection from the top and base of LDAs, meaning that pure water ice made up the bulk of the formation (between the two reflections), strong evidence that the LDAs in [[Hellas Planitia]] are glaciers covered with a thin layer of rocks. Since lineated valley terrain is derived from lobate debris aprons, it probably contains buried ice—at least in places.&lt;ref name="Souness, C 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plaut, J. et al.  2008.

==Connection to past climate==

Studies of LDAs and LVF give evidence that there have been multiple episodes of glaciation on Mars, including ones that produced glaciers nearing a kilometre in thickness. These [[ice ages]] are related to major climate shifts caused by major variations in [[axial tilt]].&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine, J. et al.  2007.  Exploring the northern mid-latitude glaciation with a general circulation model.  In: Seventh International Conference on Mars.  Abstract 3096.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, N.  2008.  Mars:  An Introduction to its Interior, Surface and Atmosphere.  Cambridge University Press.  {{ISBN|978-0-521-85226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Earth's rather large moon prevents large changes in its tilt. The two moons of Mars are tiny. So Mars undergoes large periods when its ice cap receives more direct sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_002917_2175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forget, F., et al.  2006.  Planet Mars Story of Another World.  Praxis Publishing, Chichester, UK.  {{ISBN|978-0-387-48925-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
During this time ice in the cap sublimates, and thick snow falls in mid-latitudes — the zones where concentric crater fill, lineated valley fill and lobate debris aprons are common.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, M.  2006.  The Surface of Mars.  Cambridge University Press.  {{ISBN|978-0-521-87201-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of craters on LVF indicates a late [[Amazonian period|Amazonian]] age for at least some areas.&lt;ref name="obliq"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Head, J. | date = 2006 | title = Extensive valley glacier deposits in the northern mid-latitudes of Mars:  Evidence for late Amazonian obliquity-driven climate change | journal = [[Earth Planet. Sci. Lett.]] | volume = 241 | pages = 663–671 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2005.11.016 | bibcode=2006E&amp;PSL.241..663H | issue = 3–4| last2 = Marchant | first2 = D.R. | last3 = Agnew | first3 = M.C. | last4 = Fassett | first4 = C.I. | last5 = Kreslavsky | first5 = M.A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Levy, J. | display-authors = etal | date = 2007 | title = Lineated valley fill and lobate debris apron stratigraphy in Nilosyrtis Mensae, Mars:  Evidence for phases of glacial modification of the dichotomy boundary | journal = J. Geophys. Res. | volume = 112 | doi=10.1029/2006je002852 | bibcode=2007JGRE..112.8004L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Where located==

Lineated valley fill is common in the middle latitudes, especially near the northern [[Martian dichotomy|dichotomy]] boundary. The [[Nilosyrtis Mensae]], [[Protonilus Mensae]] and [[Deuteronilus Mensae]] bear many examples of LVF.  Ismenius Lacus quadrangle and Hellas quadrangle contain many valleys displaying lineated valley fill.

LVF and other ice-related forms are collectively known as [[fretted terrain]], which includes winding and straight valleys with isolating plateaus and mesas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1029/JB078i020p04073 | author = Sharp, R | date = 1973 | title = Mars Fretted and chaotic terrains | journal = J. Geophys. Res. | volume = 78 | pages = 4073–4083 | bibcode=1973JGR....78.4073S | issue = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of lineated valley fill==

Studies of lineated valley fill have added evidence that the [[climate of Mars]] has undergone many large changes in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1945-5100.2006.tb00441.x |author1=Kreslavsky, M.  |author2=J. Head  |lastauthoramp=yes| date = 2006 | title = Modification of impact craters in the northern planes of Mars:  Implications for the Amazonian climate history | journal = Meteorit. Planet. Sci. | volume = 41 | pages = 1633–1646 | issue = 10|bibcode = 2006M&amp;PS...41.1633K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At times there is snow, and at times the snow may melt. The resulting small areas of liquid water cause weathering of the rocks and may provide a favourable environment for life. Understanding lineated valley fill and other manifestations of buried ice will allow future colonists to find sources of [[water on Mars|water]].

[[Reull Vallis]], as pictured below, displays such deposits. Sometimes the lineated floor deposits show a chevron pattern which is further evidence of movement. The picture below taken with HiRISE of Reull Vallis shows these patterns.

Councillor '''David Francis Matthew Horton [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]]''', [[Master's degree|MA]] ([[University of Cambridge|Cantab]]), [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|FRCS]], born on September 3 (year unknown), chairman of the Parish Council, gentleman farmer, pillar of the community, District Councillor for Dibley and Whitworth and main opponent of the female vicar. A notorious town bully, he controlled the Council without any opposition until the Vicar's arrival, and is consequently disliked by many, being rigid, old-fashioned, efficient, callous and punctual, yet as the show progresses, becomes lovable and endearing. Apart from the vicar, he is the only sane person in the village. Despite regularly complaining about the council, he has never missed a meeting. In fact, in one episode Jim and Owen reminisce about when David's wife went into labour with Hugo, and David held the meeting in the maternity ward. His wife left him prior to the show's beginning due to his obnoxious nature (although he mistakenly believes she left him because he was a bad cook.) In later episodes of the series, Horton comes to fall for the Vicar and even proposes to her (she accepts his proposal but later decides to back out). He is initially a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], but defects to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 2000 as part of his attempt to persuade Geraldine to marry him. Whether he switches his party allegiance back after she refuses him is unknown. His love for the vicar, however, is steadfast and true. He later supported the [[Make Poverty History]] campaign. He is a multi-millionaire. Hugo mentions that people used to call him "Dirty Dave" due to his collection of Victorian pornography. David was an unloving father to Hugo, and even threatened to disinherit him if he married Alice, whom David detests. However he changed his mind and later admitted to the Vicar that Alice and Hugo are happy together.

'''Alice Springs Horton''' (née '''Tinker''') is the [[verger]] at the church. Blonde and scatterbrained (Geraldine describes her as having "the intellectual capacity and charisma of a [[cactus]]"), Alice is the only main character who does not sit on the parish council, although she did in the episode "Autumn." She is the product of a one-night stand between her [[insanity|mad]] mother (who in the last two episodes is said to be in a mental home) and the cousin of David Horton's father (present-day David Horton's first cousin once removed and predecessor on the parish council), also called David Horton. She and Hugo, her second cousin once removed, are fond of each other and the vicar plays [[Cupid]] successfully in one episode. They eventually marry and have ten children - the eldest, Geraldine, was born on 24 December 1999, in the middle of the village nativity play in which her parents were playing Mary and Joseph. Featuring in the closing credits for most episodes, Geraldine and Alice have a cup of tea while Geraldine tries to tell Alice a joke (frequently the joke is slightly off-colour). Alice rarely understands the jokes that Geraldine tells her and usually proceeds to over-analyse the humour thereby completely killing the joke. In the final episode Geraldine's new husband Harry Kennedy explains the grammar involved and Alice finally understands it. Alice believes in the [[Easter Bunny]], [[Father Christmas]] and the [[tooth fairy]]. After reading ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' she believes herself to be descended from [[Jesus]]. She is dim-witted and naive but also sweet-natured and very endearing. She has many misconceptions, such as mistaking [[Black Sabbath]] for gospel singers, telling David that Jesus was one of [[The Carpenters]] and referring to [[Albert Einstein]] as Andrew Einstein. Alice is a fan of the [[Wombles]] and of the [[Teletubbies]]. In episode 12, January 22, 1998, when Alice gets married to Hugo Horton, her bridesmaids are La-La and Po, who hold the wedding-dress train of Alice.
As a child Alice had a series of budgies named Carrot and, until Geraldine reveals that each Carrot was a separate budgie entirely, Alice believed that her first budgie Carrot was reincarnated, "Just like Jesus, but with feathers". Alice also has a sister, Mary, who is older than Alice but is even more dim-witted. Alice's mother is often described as insane by Geraldine, and there is considerable confusion regarding Alice's father. Although she states that her father (revealed to be a philanderer) is dead, she later names David Horton, the cousin of the councillor David Horton's father as her biological father, but she often claims not to know who her father really was.

A rabid fan of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', Alice unsuccessfully tries to incorporate themes from the sci-fi show into her wedding, including having a wedding gown "with lots of hearts on it...and a different Doctor Who in each one." However, she ends up with a gown decorated with a massive heart with hers and Hugo's names inside. She succeeds in having a ''Doctor Who'' wedding during Geraldine's own wedding. When Gerry's friends take over wedding preparations, Alice uses her position as maid of honour to dress herself as the [[Tenth Doctor]] and the other bridesmaids as [[Daleks]].

'''Hugo Horton''' is David's sweet-natured, friendly yet dim-witted and childlike son; Geraldine once also likens his intellect to a cactus. In "Celebrity Vicar", a newspaper describes him in the headline "Rich as [[Croesus]], Thick as Shit"; Hugo does not think the press meant to be rude, to which David replies "Though you can't deny it's a possibility." Sometimes seen sporting a [[Royal Agricultural College]] tie, he served as his father's campaign manager at the October 1994 district council election, but inadvertently wound up going door to door with David's Labour opponent, Kevin Smewyn, delivering adverts and making introductions for him. Hugo and Alice Tinker are always shown to have tender feelings for each other, but they do not get together as a couple until Geraldine plays Cupid in "Engagement". David was never a loving nor affectionate father to Hugo, dominating him and undermining all his dreams and ambitions. In one episode, Geraldine mentions that God is a father much like his own father, and Hugo recalls what his father did to him as a child: shouting, insulting and caning him (although he does mention a time when David pretended to be [[Father Christmas]]). When Geraldine corrects him and says she was referring to a loving, caring father, Hugo believes he had another father. Despite this, Hugo still loves and respects his father but finally stands up to him when it came to marrying Alice, whom David predictably despises. He nicknames Geraldine "Mrs God". Hugo has a Golden Retriever named Bruno who is seen in "Animals" and "Election".  He is a huge fan of [[Kylie Minogue]].

'''Frank Pickle''' (born 12 August 1929) is the likable but boring and [[pedantic]] secretary of the parish council. He is so boring that nobody listens to him, even when he tries to relate such momentous events such as "the time he went down to the pub and they'd completely run out of crisps" or "the time when the milkman was 47 minutes late" or "when he heard a cuckoo in March, only it turned out to be a pigeon". In "Celebrity Vicar", while trying to get "crazy anecdotes" about Geraldine for a journalist with all the details, the newspaper headline asks "Is this The Most Boring Man in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]?" Due to his tendency to go on and on when given the opportunity, it is said that five people, including his parents, have died while he was talking, and even his therapist accused him of being boring. He decided to declare his [[homosexuality]] in a radio broadcast to the village (after over 40 years of keeping it secret), but apart from Geraldine, who was with Frank at the time, none of the villagers listened to his broadcast. The next day, he decides to assert his sexuality more openly by wearing a bright cerise blazer to attend the parish council meeting rather than his usual brown one. Other references in the show suggest that Frank is [[bisexual]], as he also once admitted to fancying [[Margaret Beckett]] as well as fellow councilors Owen Newitt and David Horton; is as affected by the naked model in the Dibley Parish Life Art Class as the others and painted the same model in the landscape class. He also admitted to sleeping with Owen's cousin Sally and it is implied that he fathered one of her three children (the other two being fathered by Jim and Owen). He defines his ideal man as a 25-year-old South American with an interest in Oxfordshire council procedures. 

"He also gives Alice away at her wedding but wears a sign which states that he is not Alice's father and also tries to put a note in the programme that states that he is not Alice's father but is a close family friend and has "not had sexual relations with Mrs Tinker in any way whatsoever"."

'''Jim Trott''' is a parish council member, who has an [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] way of prefacing "no-no-no-no-no..." to almost everything he says, in particular "yes!" A newspaper in "Celebrity Vicar" gives him the headline "No, No, No, No Brain". His stuttering once led him to lose on ''[[Deal or No Deal (UK game show)|Deal or No Deal]]''. His wife Doris does the opposite, saying "yes-yes-yes-yes-yes...". Jim used to be a good dancer, though an unconvincing singer. Despite being married to Doris, he has no qualms about joining Owen in openly flirting with the Vicar, frequently commenting on her "lovely arse". He is also openly promiscuous with a penchant for young blondes and Eastern beauties. In one episode he learns that Doris is having sex with her cousin Brenda. In the final episode, he proposed to the vicar, suggesting that he is no longer married, perhaps through divorce, or that his wife has died prior to this episode or that he is willing to commit [[bigamy]]. He became the church organist after the death of Letitia Cropley. In the episode "[[The Christmas Lunch Incident]]", Jim mentions that Doris is taking "A Competent Grandparenting Course", suggesting Jim has children but this is never mentioned in the show, though it is implied he fathered a child with Owen's cousin Sally.

'''Owen Newitt''' is a local farmer and a parish council member with a very earthy manner. He lives alone at the farm with his animals and is famous for displaying extremely poor personal hygiene, compounded with chronic problems with his stomach and bowels, both resulting in flatulence. The newspaper in "Celebrity Vicar" dubbed him "Britain's [[Body odor|B.O.]] King". He was the first to support the new vicar's appointment as a lone dissenter, saying that a woman would not be a bad thing since the previous vicar was "a regular old woman anyway", just as David looked set to persuade the other members of the parish council to oppose Geraldine's appointment. His signature running gag was that he was chronically late for the parish council meetings, and had humorously legitimate, if gruesome, reasons for his delays (often involving graphic tales of amputating animals' appendages or otherwise mangling them). Previous generations of his family also appear to be as bloodthirsty as Owen, as he proudly declares they have been "staging cock-fights" and "gassing badgers" in the village for several centuries, and he also has a few murderers in his family. He also has had a history of "sorrow and tragedy, " according to Jim and Frank: his brother drowned himself, because of his girlfriend's refusing to marry him; his father shot himself shortly after his wife left him; and his grandmother tried to leave, but his grandfather shot ''her'' and then himself. Owen proposed to the vicar in "Engagement". She rejected him, mainly because she simply did not love him (she also cited, not to his face, that "his breath smells like [[nerve agent|nerve gas]]" and the [[gel]] on his hair is really [[lard]]). He was not upset, having found out that she was a drinker and declares he cannot tolerate women who drink. Despite this, he frequently makes crude and misguided attempts at flirting with her, which typically backfire, and even proposed to her again the night before her wedding to Harry Kennedy. Regardless of his foul mouth and coarse nature, Owen is a genuinely kind-hearted and caring person, a fact noted by the Vicar, Hugo and Alice, both of whom appointed him [[Godparent|godfather]] to their firstborn daughter. Owen spent every [[Christmas]] alone since his uncle's death in 1971 until Geraldine joined him for Christmas dinner in 1996 (one of many such invitations she accepted that year). In several episodes, dialogue suggests that Owen engages in [[bestiality]] (such as when he declares rumours that the vicar is a lesbian to be the "best news since they made having sex with animals legal again"). Owen also has a swearing 'probling' and often  uses the word 'bloody,' describing the word as 'a useful adjective'.

'''Letitia Cropley''' was a Parish Council member and the Dibley church [[organist]]. Geraldine once referred to her as "The Queen of Cordon Bleurgh", and David Horton called her "The Dibley Poisoner". She was the creator of such revolting "delicacies" as "Bread and butter pudding surprise" (a recipe for which she was breeding [[snail]]s), [[Marmite]] cake (which she served for Frank's birthday), orange cake with [[Branston Pickle]] icing (which she served at the cake stall at the Dibley autumn fayre), parsnip brownies, plain pancakes "with just a hint of liver," and chocolate spread sandwiches made with cod roe. Letitia only appeared in the first series and the special "The Easter Bunny", in which she died. Her dying request to Geraldine was that she take over from her as the Easter Bunny, taking chocolate eggs around the village each Easter. However, when Geraldine saw every member of the parish council doing the same, as well as some other residents, it became clear that she had made the same request to all of them, owing to her forgetful nature. Earlier in the episode she said she had a "memory like an elephant that's lost its memory".
After her death, Jim and Frank referred to her as a redheaded beauty in her youth, along with Owen's father having talked of her often, with various nicknames such as 'Luscious Letitia,' Titillatin' Tish,' and 'always lets you dock your boat in her jetty Letty'. In her youth, she was notoriously promiscuous, with Jim and David both describing her as "rampant" and a "[[nymphomaniac]]." It has also been suggested that she has a crush on Frank and thinks he has 'nice thighs', as she admitted on her death bed. She was generally seen on the Parish Council [[crochet]]ing.

They first meet at the drinks party before Alice and Hugo's wedding and later they meet again when Simon comes up for Sunday lunch with David. After many efforts to get rid of several parishioners who come knocking on her door with various requests, including telling Jim Trott and Frank Pickle that 7 down on a crossword is "Plodipop", and arranging the four words "Leave-You-Remorseless-Bastards" on the [[Scrabble]] board, Geraldine finally manages to join Simon who's waiting patiently in her bedroom, followed by a few weeks of romantic bliss. Later Simon dumps her telling her that he has a girlfriend in Liverpool. A struck Geraldine therefore goes into seclusion, binging on chocolate bars and pots of ice cream, and neglecting her church duties. She decides to resign from her ministry as the Vicar of Dibley, but changes her mind when her parishioners and friends show their loyalty and support by hanging up a huge banner that reads "That tall git Simon may have bonked you and then dumped you like an old jock strap but we still love you. "

'''Harry Jasper Kennedy''' moves to Dibley from London, buying Sleepy Cottage from David Horton for £500,000. His first visitors in Dibley are Geraldine and Alice, who initially intend to make it clear to Harry that he is not welcome in the village, but are won over by his good looks and friendly manner the moment he opens his front door. Over the course of the following days, Harry and Geraldine go on a succession of dates together, which culminate in the two sharing a kiss. Their romance takes a brief knock when Harry's sister Rosie ([[Keeley Hawes]]) visits him in Dibley and Geraldine mistakes her for Harry's romantic partner. However, Harry proposes to Geraldine, who ecstatically agrees to marry him. Their wedding is the focal point of the final regular episode of the series, ''The Vicar in White''. Harry briefly appears once more in the 2007 special sketch for Comic Relief, in which he and Geraldine participate in ''Celebrity, Non-Entity Wife Swap'', in which [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] moves in with Geraldine for a week, while Harry spends a week with [[Trudie Styler]].

===Alice and Hugo's children===

'''Geraldine Horton:''' The daughter of Alice and Hugo Horton. She was born on Christmas Eve 1999 during Geraldine Granger's nativity play, when Alice and Hugo played Mary and Joseph. She has nine siblings. Her grandfather, David Horton, pities baby Geraldine and her siblings for being born to their simple-minded parents yet it is evident that they adore their daughter. A statue was made of Geraldine, as an infant, on the village green. She appears in the episodes "Winter", "Spring" and "Summer" and again with all nine of her siblings in a Christmas special. In the Christmas special Horton is presented, along with her five sisters, in pink tutus or pink plaid skirts and other accessories such as pink fur ponchoes. She is the only child of Hugo and Alice whose name is mentioned. In the "Merry Christmas" episode, when the Horton children are revealed, Geraldine stands in the centre in front of her father (holding her youngest brother) and brothers and stands behind her four sisters and next to her mother (holding the youngest sister). Alice and Hugo had planned on naming their first born "Vicar" after the vicar but Geraldine suggests the name "Geraldine" instead and this becomes the child's name.

Alice and Hugo's other children only ever appeared as a cameo in the 2004 Christmas Special.  They had 10 children (four sons and six daughters).  As seen in a documentary of the 2004/05 specials DVD release, a scene with Geraldine greeting the children revealing their outrageous names was cut before the show went in front of cameras.

This is a '''list of firsts in the [[Geographic North Pole]]'''.

* One of the first to reach the Geographic North Pole (disputed): there were two primary claimants, [[Frederick Cook]], and his two [[Inuit]] men, Aapilak and Ittukusuk, on April 21, 1908 and [[Robert Edwin Peary]], [[Matthew Henson]] and four Inuit men: [[Ootah]], [[Seegloo]], [[Egingway]], and [[Ooqueah]] on April 6, 1909. Peary and Henson's claim eventually won widespread acceptance, but now neither claim is widely accepted.
* First to fly over the North Pole (disputed): On May 9, 1926, Americans [[Richard E. Byrd]] and pilot [[Floyd Bennett]] claimed a successful flight over the North Pole in a Fokker F-VII Tri-motor called the ''Josephine Ford''.  Byrd took off from [[Spitsbergen]] and returned to the same airfield. His claim, widely accepted at first, has been challenged since.
* First [[Polar route|transpolar]] flight over the North Pole: On May 12, three days after the Byrd flight, Norwegian [[Roald Amundsen]], his American sponsor [[Lincoln Ellsworth]] and the Italian aeronautic engineer [[Umberto Nobile]] flew over the Pole in the [[semi-rigid airship]] ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]]'', designed and piloted by Nobile.  The total crew was 16 men.  The ''Norge'' began in [[Spitsbergen]] and flew to [[Alaska]].
* First [[Polar route|transpolar]] flight over the North Pole in an airplane: [[Valery Chkalov]] and two others flew a [[Tupolev ANT-25]] on June 18–20, 1937 from [[Moscow]] to [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Red Arctic : Polar Exploration and the Myth of the North in the Soviet Union, 1932-1939|last = McCannon|first = John|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1998|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 71|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u1OyKDItM5wC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=Chkalov+1937+polar+route&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=poZLe1uzZe&amp;sig=YCmg5eNKIfdoMkKQyZd8MODQ0Vo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgop3En8PJAhVHVj4KHcPmA3EQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Chkalov%201937%20polar%20route&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* First [[Drifting ice station|North Pole ice station]]: [[North Pole-1]] ([[Soviet Union]]) was established at {{Coord|89|25|N|78|40|W|name=North Pole-1 (start)}} (about 20 kilometres (12&amp;nbsp;mi) from the North Pole) on May 21, 1937. The expedition members: oceanographer [[Pyotr Shirshov]], meteorologist [[Yevgeny Konstantinovich Fyodorov|Yevgeny Fyodorov]], radio operator [[Ernst Krenkel]], and the leader [[Ivan Papanin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=66677|title=North Pole Drifting Stations (1930s-1980s)|accessdate=2012-01-08|publisher=[[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]|date=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted scientific research at the station for the next 274 days. On February 19, 1938, the group was evacuated by the ice breakers ''[[Icebreaker Taymyr|Taimyr]]'' and ''Murman''. By that time the station drifted 2850&amp;nbsp;km (1,770&amp;nbsp;mi) and was approaching the eastern coast of Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science20.com/chatter_box/arctic_heroes_2_north_pole_1 |title=Arctic Heroes #2 - North Pole 1|accessdate=2012-01-08|last=Lockerby|first= Patrick |date=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/russiansinthearc006180mbp|title=The Russians in the Arctic|accessdate=2012-01-08|last=Armstrong|first=Terence|year=2011|isbn=978-1-245-58209-4|publisher=Nabu Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[Summit|mountain peak]] of [[North America]].  Denali is the third most [[Topographic prominence|topographically prominent]] and third most [[Topographic isolation|topographically isolated]] [[summit]] on Earth after [[Mount Everest]] and [[Aconcagua]].]]

The following sortable table comprises the 230 [[Summit|mountain peaks]] of [[North America|greater North America]]&lt;ref name=NA&gt;This article defines [[North America|greater North America]] as the portion of the [[Continent|continental landmass]] of the [[Americas]] extending westward and northward from the [[Isthmus of Panama]] plus the [[Island|ocean islands]] surrounding that landmass.  This article defines the ocean islands of greater North America to include the [[Island#Continental islands|coastal islands]] of [[Geography of North America|North America]], the [[Caribbean|islands of the Caribbean Sea]], the [[Lucayan Archipelago]], the [[List of islands of Greenland|islands of Greenland]] ([[Greenland|Kalaallit Nunaat]]), the [[List of islands of Canada|islands of Canada]], and the [[List of islands of Alaska|islands of Alaska]].  The [[Hawaiian Islands]] are not included because they are considered part of [[Oceania]].&lt;/ref&gt; with at least {{convert|100|km|2|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic isolation]] and at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]]'''.&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in the 48 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[contiguous United States]] include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denali]] is one of only three summits on Earth with more than {{convert|6000|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic isolation.  Four major summits of greater North America exceed {{convert|2000|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, eight exceed {{convert|1000|km|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, 35 exceed {{convert|500|km|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, 107 exceed {{convert|200|km|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, the following 230 major summits exceed {{convert|100|km|2|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, and 413 exceed {{convert|50|km|2|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic isolation.

The '''Mozambique Channel''' ({{lang-fr|Canal du Mozambique}}, {{lang-mg|Lakandranon'i Mozambika}}, {{lang-pt|Canal de Moçambique}}) is an [[arm (geography)|arm]] of the [[Indian Ocean]] located between the [[Southeast Africa]]n countries of [[Madagascar]] and [[Mozambique]]. The channel is about {{convert|1600|km|-2|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|419|km|0|abbr=on}} across at its narrowest point, and reaches a depth of {{convert|3292|m|-1|abbr=on}} about {{convert|230|km|0|abbr=on}} off the coast of Mozambique. A warm current, the [[Mozambique Current]],  flows in a southward direction in the channel, leading into the [[Agulhas Current]] off the east coast of [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="brit"/&gt;

==Extent==
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO) defines the limits of the Mozambique Channel as follows:&lt;ref name="iho"/&gt;

::''On the North.'' A line from the estuary of the [[Ruvuma River|River Rovuma]] ({{coord|10|28|S|40|26|E}}) to Ras Habu, the Northern point of [[Grande Comore|Ile Grande Comore]], the Northern of the [[Comoro Islands|Comore (Comoro) Islands]], to Cap d'Ambre (Amber) the Northern extremity of [[Madagascar]] ({{coord|11|57|S|49|17|E}}).

::''On the East.'' The West coast of Madagascar.

::''On the South.'' A line from [[Cape Saint Marie|Cap Sainte-Marie]], the Southern extreme of Madagascar to [[Ponta d'Ouro|Ponto do Ouro]] on the mainland ({{coord|26|53|S|32|56|E}}).

::''On the West.'' The mainland of South Africa.

Despite being defined as the South African coast by the IHO, the western limit of the channel is more correctly defined as the coast of [[Southern Africa]] or, more specifically, of [[Mozambique]].

==Islands in the channel==
===Comoros===
*[[Grande Comore]]
*[[Mohéli]]
*[[Anjouan]]

===France===
*[[Region of France]] : [[Mayotte]] (claimed by [[Comoros]])
*[[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]], district of [[Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean]] :
**[[Banc du Geyser]] (claimed by [[Madagascar]] and [[Comoros]])
**[[Juan de Nova Island]] (claimed by [[Madagascar]])
**[[Europa Island]] (claimed by [[Madagascar]])
**[[Bassas da India]] (claimed by [[Madagascar]])

===Mozambique===
[[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago]]

==History==
The Mozambique Channel was a [[World War II]] clashpoint during the [[Battle of Madagascar]].

==NUTS 2 regions redrawing==
Some of the present NUTS II regions of Bulgaria no longer meet the relevant technical requirements, mostly due to general population decline and increasing regional disproportion. A 2013 study by FLGR Consult commissioned by the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Works analyzed the state and trends of change in the characteristics of these regions to identify several options for the pending redrawing of the NUTS II map of the country. The process was restarted in 2017 with certain modified versions considered, and final decision due by the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;S. Okov.

{{about|the Russian Orthodox monastery and ancient tree at Hebron|the ancient site and oak/terebinth outside historical Hebron|Mamre}}
[[File:Monastery in Hebron.jpg|thumb|210px|upright|In the monastery of the [[Holy Trinity]].]]

The '''Oak of Mamre''' (also called the '''Oak of Sibta'''), at Khirbet es-Sibte (also as Ain Sibta), is a site venerated by some as the "'''Oak of Abraham'''", and distinct from the more ancient site of [[Mamre]]. It owes its name to an ancient tree, which seems to be dead but has a young sprig growing next to it, and stands on the grounds of the modern [[Russian Orthodox]] [[Abraham's Oak Holy Trinity Monastery|Monastery of the Holy Trinity]].

The site is located {{convert|2|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} southwest of Mamre, historically near [[Hebron]]&lt;ref&gt;'''Genesis 13:18''' ''Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD''(KJV)&lt;/ref&gt; and now inside the city. Also called ''The Oak of Abraham'',&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew term ''Eloney Mamreh'' of Genesis 13:18 is considered by some translators to be a name of a region in Canaan. Other scholars dispute this and suggest that it is the reference to the terebinth trees of Mamre; or to the ''Oak of Mamre'', which is now known as ''Abraham's Oak''&lt;/ref&gt; it is an ancient tree which, in one tradition, is said to mark the place where [[Abraham]] entertained the three angels&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stetson.edu/~psteeves/relnews/hebron.html ''New Challenge for Arafat: A Russian Church''] by Serge Schmemann for the New York Times, July 11, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; or where Abraham pitched his tent.

This site is distinct and at a different location from the site considered as Mamre by [[Herod the Great]], [[Josephus]], [[Constantine the Great]], early Church historians and Christian pilgrims all until the mid-12th century, such as [[Arculf]] and [[Abbot Daniel]]. That site is at a location called in Arabic Ramat al-Khalil (the older name used by archaeologists) and currently Bir al-Haram ar-Rameh, which is a few kilometres north of the site described in this article. After the mid-12th century, the tradition of the "Oak of Mamre" has migrated to one or several places along the road from Mamre to Hebron, such as the site from this article.

==History==
[[File:Avraham oak 1912.jpg|thumb|Abraham's Oak in 1912.]]
[[File:Hebron Yeshiva students, c. 1920s.png|thumb|Students of the [[Hebron Yeshiva|Slabodka Yeshiva]] at the Oak of Mamre c. 1927.]]
[[File:Oak of Mamre 1.jpg|thumb|The Oak of Mamre in 2008.]]

As written in a footnote from an 1895 publication of Arculf's pilgrimage report, "[t]he Oak or Terebinth of Abraham has been shown in two different sites. Arculf and many others ([[Jerome]], [[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Itin[erarium] Hierosol[ymitanum]]], [[Sozomen]], Eucherius [possibly [[Eucherius of Lyon]]], [[Benjamin of Tudela]], the Abbot Daniel,.... etc.) seem to point to the ruin of er Râmeh, near which is Beit el Khulil, or [[Abraham's House]], with a fine spring well. This is still held by the Jews to be the Oak of Mamre. The Christians point to another site, Ballûtet Sebta, where there is a fine specimen of Sindian ([[Quercus pseudococcifera|Quercus Pseudococcifera]])."&lt;ref name="PPTS"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/stream/libraryofpalesti03paleuoft#page/n57/mode/2up/search/hebron |title=The Pilgrimage of Arculfus in the Holy Land (About the Year A.D. 670) |author=Arculf |date=1895 |website=archive.org |publisher=[[Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society]] |location=London |pages=33–34 |access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ballut'' is the Arabic word for oak.

The site of the oak was acquired in 1868 by [[Andrey Ivanovich Kapustin|Archimandrite Antonin (Kapustin)]] for the [[Church of Russia]], and the [[Abraham's Oak Holy Trinity Monastery|Monastery of the Holy Trinity]] was founded nearby. The site has since been a major attraction for Russian [[pilgrims]] before the revolution, and is the only functioning Christian shrine in the [[Hebron]] region. After the Russian Revolution, the property came under the control of the [[ROCOR]].

A long-standing tradition is that the ''Oak of Abraham'' will die before the appearance of the [[Antichrist]]. The main oak trunk has appeared to be dead since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6392441_ITM |title=Hebron's holy tree is dead but its successors live. |author= |date=27 December 1996 |work=accessmylibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3PkGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5zYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7056,3033524&amp;dq=mamre%20tree |title=Rome News-Tribune – Google News Archive Search |author= |date= |work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following construction work in the 1970s, a wooden ring in the form of a [[chalice]] was built around the tree, and its roots began to die. In 1997, a small [[sprig (agriculture)|sprig]] was seen growing near the withered oak. In October 2016, Russian botanists began a project to save the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=13359|title= Russian experts will work in Palestine to save the Oak of Mamre mentioned in Bible|date=October 24, 2016|work=[[Interfax]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 a root sprout appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravoslavie.ru/news/28900.htm|title=Российские специалисты проанализировали состояние Мамврийского дуба |author=|date= |work=pravoslavie.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hebron Monastery has emerged as a political issue between Russia and Palestinian authorities.

'''PROBA-2''' is the second satellite in the [[European Space Agency]]'s series of [[PROBA]] low-cost [[satellite]]s that are being used to validate new spacecraft technologies while also carrying scientific instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Technology/Proba_Missions/About_Proba-2 |title=About PROBA-2 |date=2012-12-02 |publisher=[[ESA]] |accessdate = 2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; PROBA-2 is a small satellite (130&amp;nbsp;kg) developed under an ESA General Support Technology Program (GSTP) contract by a Belgian consortium led by Verhaert (now [[QinetiQ|QinetiQ Space]]) of Kruibeke, Belgium. The nominal mission duration was two years.&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt; The mission's most recent extension runs to {{Date|2016-12-31}}.&lt;ref name=ex2016&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/director-desk/54999-working-life-extensions-for-esas-science-missions/ |title=Working life extensions for ESA’s science missions |date=28 November 2014 |website=ESA Science &amp; Technology |publisher=[[European Space Agency|ESA]] |access-date=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission summary==
It was launched on {{Date|2009-11-2}}, with the [[Rockot]] launch system together with [[ESA]]'s [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite|SMOS]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.eoportal.org/didyouknow/080923_did1.html |title=Successful launch qualification test for PROBA-2 |date=2008-09-16 |publisher=[[ESA]] |accessdate=2013-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725074327/http://news.eoportal.org/didyouknow/080923_did1.html |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform was launched in a [[Sun-synchronous orbit|sun-synchronous]] [[low Earth orbit]] (altitude of 725&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt;

PROBA-2 contains five scientific instruments. Two of them are designated to observe the [[Sun]]: "The Sun Watcher using APS and Image Processing" ([[SWAP (instrument)|SWAP]], an EUV imager) and the "Large Yield Radiometer" ([[LYRA]]), a radiometer made of diamond photodiodes. The Principal investigator teams of both instruments are hosted at the [[Royal Observatory of Belgium]]. This institute will also host the [http://proba2.oma.be PROBA-2 Science Center]  from which the [[SWAP (instrument)|SWAP]] and [[LYRA]] instruments will be operated and their data distributed. There are three other instruments to measure basic space plasma properties: the [[Dual segmented Langmuir probe]] (DSLP)&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt; (developed by the [[Astronomical Institute of Czech Academy of Sciences|Astronomical Institute]] and Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic), the Thermal Plasma Measurement Unit (TPMU), and the Science Grade Vector Magnetometer (SGVM) developed by the [[Technical University of Denmark]].&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt;

The '''Prime Minister of the Cook Islands''' is the [[head of government]] of the [[Cook Islands]], a self-governing territory in [[Associated state|free association]] with [[New Zealand]]. The office was established in 1965, when [[History of the Cook Islands|self-government]] was first granted to the islands. Originally, the title "Premier" was used, but this was replaced by the title of "Prime Minister" in 1981.

'''Republic of Croatia Square''' ({{lang-hr|Trg Republike Hrvatske}}) is one of the biggest squares in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. The square is located in [[Donji grad (Zagreb)|Lower Town]], with the [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|Croatian National Theatre]] building at its centre. It is sometimes billed as the "most beautiful square in Zagreb".&lt;ref name="mich"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.viamichelin.co.uk/web/Datasheet/1bb65f7299e2503bf3ea2421e521b3c8/125195/Zagreb,%20the%20beautiful%20Croatian%20city?from=DIRECTORY|title=Zagreb, the beautiful Croatian city|last=Tresmontant|first=Emmanuel|date=6 October 2008|work=ViaMichelin.co.uk|publisher=[[ViaMichelin]]|accessdate=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present-day square was formed in the period between 1856 (when the former hospital was built on its northern side) and 1964 (when the ''Ferimport'' building was erected on the western side). However, the majority of buildings overlooking the square were built in the late 19th century in the [[Historicism (art)|historicist]] style of architecture.

Republic of Croatia Square was the first in line of three squares which form the west wing of the so-called [[Lenuci's Horseshoe|Lenuci's horseshoe]] ({{lang-hr|Lenucijeva potkova}}), a U-shaped belt of squares and parks designed by engineer [[Milan Lenuci]] in the late 19th century which frames the core part of Zagreb's city centre. The east wing of the belt is formed by the King Tomislav, Strossmayer and [[Nikola Šubić Zrinski Square|Zrinski]] squares, and the west wing by the Marulić, Mažuranić and Republic of Croatia squares, with the Botanical Garden connecting the two. The square is home to several cultural and educational institutions and several landmark sculptures.

==Timeline==
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2015}}
*1855&amp;ndash;1856 - The square begins to take shape with the first building constructed on its northern side, a hospital ran by [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughters of Charity]]. From 1868 to 1882 the building housed a tobacco factory, and when the factory was moved out in 1882 it was taken over by the [[University of Zagreb]]. Today it houses the Zagreb Faculty of Law and the university rectorate. It was designed by architect Ludwig von Zettl.
*1864 - The area of the present-day square is used as a fair ground for the first trade fair held in Croatia, the First Dalmatian-Croatian-Slavonian Trade Exhibition ({{lang-hr|Prva dalmatinsko-hrvatska-slavonska gospodarska izložba}}), which was opened by ''[[Ban (title)|ban]]'' [[Josip Šokčević]] and attended by more than 3,000 companies from throughout Croatia and the [[Austrian Empire]].
*1874 - The building which today houses the ''[[Školska knjiga]]'' publishing company is built on the eastern side. Designed by Janko Jambrišak, it went through several renovations and modifications since then.
*1876&amp;ndash;1878 - A two-story house designed by [[Franjo Klein]] is built on the eastern side, originally as the headquarters of the Croatian chamber of commerce (''Hrvatsko gospodarsko društvo''). In 1922 a third floor was added; today it is part of the Faculty of Law.
*1884 - The southern side of the square is closed, through the construction of the building which housed the ''[[Sokol]]'' [[gymnastics]] society and the ''Kolo'' folklore group. A revised design by architect Matija Antolec was used for the building. The west wing was added during the construction of the Croatian National Theatre 11 years later, which was originally used for storing theatre props (today it houses a spare balet hall, art workshops and heating systems for the theatre building). In 1969 the west wing was connected to the theatre via an underground tunnel. The rest of the building today houses the [[Academy of Dramatic Art, University of Zagreb|Academy of Dramatic Art]].
*1888 - The building housing the School of Crafts (''Obrtna škola'', today the School of Applied Arts and Design) and the [[Museum of Arts and Crafts, Zagreb|Museum of Arts and Crafts]] is built on the western side, designed by architect [[Hermann Bollé]].
*1889 - Eastern side takes its final form with the building of the Teacher's Association (''Učiteljski dom'', today the Croatian School Museum), designed by Leo Hönigsberg of the [[Hönigsberg &amp; Deutsch]] architecture studio.
*1891 - A two-story building built on the northwest corner, designed by [[Kuno Waidmann]] (today home of the [[Miroslav Krleža Lexicographical Institute]]).
*1895 - The new building of the [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|Croatian National Theatre]] designed by [[Fellner &amp; Helmer]] opens (the theatre moves here from its old location in the [[Old City Hall (Zagreb)|Old City Hall]] in [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gradec]]). The inauguration is attended by Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] and marked by a student protest who burned the Hungarian flag at [[Ban Jelačić Square]] (as the theatre was built during the reign of ''[[Ban (title)|ban]]'' [[Károly Khuen-Héderváry]] and the project was seen as part of his [[Magyarization]] policies).
*1899 - A two-story house built on the eastern side, designed by Martin Pilar. In 1922 the building was reconstructed and a third floor and a [[mansard roof]] were added, based on the designs by Oton Goldscheider. Today it houses the ''Kazališna kavana'' ([[English language|English]]: Theatre Cafe).
*1903 - [[Vienna Secession|Secessionist]]-style building erected on the southwest corner, designed by [[Vjekoslav Bastl]] for Hönigsberg &amp; Deutsch
* 1911&amp;ndash;1912 - The northern part of the square undergoes redecoration, designed by Ignjat Fischer. Obelisk-shaped candelabra which were built in front of the National Theatre moved to the [[Mirogoj cemetery]] and [[Ivan Meštrović]]'s sculpture ''Well of Life'' was installed in its place.
* 1913 - East of the ''Kolo'' building, Frank House was erected, designed by [[Viktor Kovačić]] in the Renaissance Revival style
* 1964 - The ''Željpoh'' building (later known as ''Ferimport'' building) built on the western side of the square, designed by [[Stanko Fabris]]. 
* 2014 - ''Željpoh'' building demolished in 2009, the new building of the [[Zagreb Academy of Music]] was built on its location, and opened in September 2014.

In 1884 it was handed over to the City of Zagreb and then moved first to Strossmayer square before being moved again and installed at its current location in 1907.

==Former names==
Being one of the most prominent squares in Zagreb its name was often changed in accordance to political circumstances of the time. The last change happened in 2017, as citizens' groups were lobbying for another name change on the grounds that [[Josip Broz Tito]] is a negative historical personality, due to his involvement in the many deaths during the rule of his communist regime.&lt;ref name="index1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/inicijativa-krug-za-trg-na-trgu-marsala-tita-ni-jedno-mjesto-se-ne-smije-zvati-njegovim-imenom/436932.aspx|title=Inicijativa Krug za trg na Trgu maršala Tita: "Ni jedno mjesto se ne smije zvati njegovim imenom"|date=6 June 2009|publisher=Index.hr|language=Croatian|accessdate=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a complete list of names the square carried throughout its history.&lt;ref name="snjeska1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knežević|first=Snješka|title=Zagrebačka zelena potkova|publisher=[[Školska knjiga]]|location=Zagreb|date=1996|isbn=953-0-60524-2 |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*1941&amp;ndash;1945 ''Trg I.'' (Square No. 1)
*1945&amp;ndash;1946 ''Kazališni trg'' (Theatre Square)
*1946&amp;ndash;2017 ''Trg maršala Tita'' ([[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]] Square)
*2017&amp;ndash;present ''Trg Republike Hrvatske'' (Republic of Croatia Square)

===Name Change Controversy===
In February 2008 about 2000 protesters, dressed in red aprons, gathered at the Marshal Tito Square, as it was known at the time, demanding the square to be renamed Theatre Square. Some 200 supporters of [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]] also assembled at the opposite end of the square. The police prevented the two groups from coming in contact with each other. Zagreb's Mayor Milan Bandić said that there is no historic reason to change the name of the square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=New Europe Brussels team|title=Marshal Tito Square brings Controversy|url=http://www.neurope.eu/article/marshal-tito-square-brings-controversy/|website=neurope|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=AFP|title=Thousands of Croatians rally against Tito Square|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=02&amp;dd=10&amp;nav_id=47607|website=b92|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June, 2017, the same mayor stated that he would suggest the square to be renamed and that the new name would be the Square of the Republic of Croatia. &lt;ref&gt;http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/ipak-preimenovanje-bandic-ima-novo-ime-za-trg-marsala-tita---480965.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vecernji.hr/zagreb/milan-bandic-trg-marsala-tita-1178838&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://vijesti.hrt.hr/394027/bandic-neka-se-trg-marsala-tita-preimenuje-u-trg-republike-hrvatske&lt;/ref&gt; Square was officially renamed by the City of Zagreb Assembly, on 31 August/1 September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/odluceno-je-trg-se-vise-ne-zove-po-marsalu-titu/991738.aspx Odlučeno je Trg se više ne zove po maršalu Titu]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ronald John Johnston''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Academy of Learned Societies for the Social Sciences|FAcSS]], [[British Academy|FBA]] (born 30 March 1941&lt;ref name="Academy"&gt;[http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/ord.cfm?member=3166 British Academy Fellows Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Swindon]],&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;Sidaway, J. (2009): Johnston, R. J. In: [[International Encyclopedia of Human Geography]]: 11–13. Elsevier (Amsterdam).&lt;/ref&gt; England) is a British [[human geography|human geographer]], known for elaborating his discipline's foundations, particularly its history and nature, and for his contributions to urban social geography and [[electoral geography]]. His broad scope is illustrated by the fact that he makes extensive use of quantitative methods, while [[critical geography|critically]] dealing with subjects of social and political relevance.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia" /&gt; Johnston also is an unusually productive author: As of December 2009, he has authored or co-authored more than 50 books and 800 papers, and edited or co-edited a further more than 40 books (if translated and revised editions are counted separately).&lt;ref name="Lifetime"&gt;[http://www.bris.ac.uk/geography/news/2009/144.html Professor Johnston receives a lifetime achievement award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129042134/http://www.bris.ac.uk/geography/news/2009/144.html |date=29 November 2014 }} Announcement by the University of Bristol. Published 3 December 2009, retrieved 3 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Publications"&gt;[http://www.ggy.bris.ac.uk/personal/RonJohnston/johnston_pubslist.pdf List of publications], as of 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Among the books he has edited is ''The Dictionary of Human Geography'', the first four editions of which as main editor.

==Academic career==
After receiving his bachelor's and master's degrees from the [[University of Manchester]] in 1962 and 1964, respectively, he moved to [[Monash University]] in Melbourne, Australia. There, Johnston obtained a PhD degree, and came in contact with what has become known as the [[quantitative revolution]] of geography.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia" /&gt; He also wrote his first paper on urban social geography during that time. From 1967–1974, he was part of the academic staff at the [[University of Canterbury]] in Christchurch, New Zealand, where his interest in electoral geography began to develop. Johnston then was appointed professor at the [[University of Sheffield]]. In 1979, ''Geography and Geographers'', which he has updated and expanded every few years since then, and whose various editions have been translated into four languages,&lt;ref name="Publications" /&gt; was published. Johnston became co-editor of the two journals [[Progress in Human Geography]] and [[Environment and Planning A]] that same year. In 1981, the first edition of ''The Dictionary of Human Geography'', to which Johnston has contributed hundreds of articles,&lt;ref name="Publications" /&gt; was published. It has maintained its status as the discipline's authoritative dictionary ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Setten, G. (2008): Encyclopaedic Vision: Speculating on The Dictionary of Human Geography. ''Geoforum'' 39 (3): 1097–1104.&lt;/ref&gt; After serving as pro-vice-chancellor for academic affairs of the University of Sheffield, he became vice-chancellor of the [[University of Essex]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="Calendar"&gt;[http://www.essex.ac.uk/academic/docs/cal/former.shtm University of Essex Calendar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007233550/http://www.essex.ac.uk/academic/docs/cal/former.shtm |date=7 October 2012 }}, retrieved on 22 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995, Johnston has been professor at the [[University of Bristol]]. He resigned from the editorial boards of both ''Progress in Human Geography'' and ''Environment and Planning A'' in 2006.

==Recognition==
Johnston has been one of the most cited geographers for decades.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In an analysis of citation records based on the [[Social Sciences Citation Index|SSCI]] and the [[Science Citation Index|SCI]], he was identified as the second most cited geographer for 1981–1985, and the third most cited one for 1986–1990 (Bodman, A. (1992): Holes in the Fabric. More on the Master Weavers in Human Geography. ''Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers'' 17 (1): 108–109). In another citation count that covered more than 20 years (1981 – October 2002), this time based on the SSCI and the [[Arts and Humanities Citation Index|A&amp;HCI]], Johnston was listed as one of twelve geographers who had been cited more than 1000 times (Yeung, H. W. (2002): Deciphering citations. ''Environment and Planning A'' 34 (12): 2093–2102).&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most prestigious awards Johnston has received are the [[Murchison Award]] (1985) and the [[Victoria Medal (geography)|Victoria Medal]] (1990) by the [[Royal Geographical Society]], the [[Lauréat Prix International de Géographie Vautrin Lud|Prix Vautrin Lud]] at the International Geography Festival 1999, and a lifetime achievement award from the [[Association of American Geographers]] (2009).&lt;ref name="Lifetime" /&gt; Furthermore, he holds honorary doctorates from the University of Essex (D.Univ. 1996),&lt;ref name= "Calendar" /&gt; Monash University (LL.D. 1999),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adm.monash.edu.au/records-archives/archives/honorarygraduates/honorarygraduates-90-99.html Roll of Honorary Graduates at Monash University (1990–1999)], retrieved on 22 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the University of Sheffield (Litt.D. 2002)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/pr/press_releases/pr02/17jan02.html University of Sheffield Honorary Degree Recipients 2002], retrieved on 22 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Bath]] (Litt.D. 2005).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bath.ac.uk/annual-report/04-05/hongrads.pdf University of Bath Honorary Graduates 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a founding Academician (later renamed fellow) of the [[Academy of Learned Societies for the Social Sciences|Academy of Social Sciences]] (FAcSS) in 1999, and was elected an ordinary fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="Academy" /&gt; Johnston was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2011 Birthday Honours]] for services to scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=59808 |date=11 June 2011 |page=11 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apple Park satellite view May 2017.jpg|thumb|SkySat image of [[Apple Park]] taken in May 2017]]
The resolution of the SkySat satellite imagery and videos is high enough to observe objects that impact the global economy such as terrain, cars and shipping containers. The satellites can capture video clips lasting up to 90 seconds at 30 frames per second.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wogan|first=David|title=High-definition video from space is available for purchase.

'''TerraFly''' is a web-enabled system designed to aid in the visualization of spatial and remote sensed imagery.
TerraFly users visualize [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]] and various overlays, such as street names, roads, restaurants, services and demographic data. Users virtually "fly" over imagery via a web browser, without any software
to install or plug in.&lt;ref name="NASA TerraFly Summary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gcmd.nasa.gov/records/TerraFly.html| title= TerraFly Summary |publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrafly's tools include geospatial querying, data drill-down, interfaces with real-time data suppliers,
demographic analysis, annotation, route dissemination via autopilots, customizable applications, production of aerial atlases and application programming interface ([[API]]) for web sites.

== Media coverage ==
The TerraFly project has been featured on TV news programs and worldwide press. It has been covered by the New York Times,&lt;ref name="New York Times article"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E6DC1F38F932A3575BC0A9649C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=terrafly&amp;st=cse| title=  Zoom Out, Then Nosedive: A Bird's-Eye View of Your Burg |publisher=[[The New York Times]] | first=Amir | last=Tusher | date=2002-08-01 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; USA Today, NPR,&lt;ref name="NPR report"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10817208| title= NPR Technology Report by Greg Allen |publisher=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Science and Nature journals.

'''TerraServer''' is a commercial website{{ref|website}} specializing in [[Aerial imagery|aerial]] and [[satellite imagery]] which was originally launched in 1997.  It is owned and operated by '''TerraServer.com, Inc.''' in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].  The company was previously named '''Aerial Images''' until May 2002 when the assets of Aerial Images were sold and the company renamed itself TerraServer.com, Inc.

==History==
Aerial Images was a part of the original project that involved [[Microsoft]] and [[Compaq]] as a demonstration of the real-world scalability of [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]] and Microsoft's [[Windows NT]] Server.  Aerial Images brought in satellite imagery from Sovinformsputnik (the Russian Federal Space Agency) and [[GeoEye]]. TerraServer expanded its partnerships and became an image provider for LandVoyage and the [[DigitalGlobe]] family of companies: [[GlobeXplorer]] and AirPhotoUSA, as well as imagery from the [[USGS]] and [[USDA]].

After an agreement that ended in January 2000, the operations split into two pieces. Aerial Images kept the TerraServer.com domain name to create a commercial site selling custom selected imagery. Microsoft went forward with their own imagery project, which provides access to [[United States Geological Survey]] imagery. The Microsoft project used the TerraServer brand name in a variety of ways including terraserver.homeadvisor.com, terraserver.microsoft.com, and terraserver.msn.com.  In 2003, Microsoft [[wikt:Rebrand|rebranded]] its research service as [[TerraServer-USA]], and then [[Microsoft Research Maps]]. There may exist confusion between the two sites, because of the name similarity. However, TerraServer.com, Inc. is the sole owner of the registered trademark '''TerraServer'''. The "TerraServer" name is a reference to 'Terra', which is Latin for 'earth' or 'land'.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

==Website==
The TerraServer viewer allows users to select imagery from different dates and of different resolutions. While most of the TerraServer imagery is focused on high resolution, color, satellite and aerial imagery, TerraServer.com also offers [[Infrared photography|Color Infrared Imagery]], [[Panchromatic film|Panchromatic Imagery]], Low Resolution Satellite Imagery, and [[topographic map]]s.  Subscribers to TerraServer.com gain access to a drawing and measuring tool that can measure surface distance and area on the images. TerraServer also makes a number of image overlays available, including road names, FEMA flood data, earthquake data, landslide data, real estate parcels, parks, schools, hospitals, airports, and zip codes.

For the later United States Coast Guard cutter see {{ship|USCGC|Bear|WMEC-901}}

The '''SS ''Bear''''' was a dual steam-powered and sailing ship built with {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on|1|spell=in}}-thick sides which had a long life in various cold-water and ice-filled environs. She was a forerunner of modern [[icebreaker]]s and had an exceptionally diverse service life. According to the [[United States Coast Guard]] official website, ''Bear'' is described as "probably the most famous ship in the history of the Coast Guard."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uscg.mil/pacarea/cgcHealy/history.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Built in Scotland in 1874 as a steamer for [[seal hunt|sealing]], she was owned and operated out of [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] for ten years. In the mid-1880s, she took part in the search for the [[Adolphus Greely|Greely]] Expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Her services also included the second expedition of Admiral [[Richard E. Byrd]] to [[Antarctica]], and again to the southernmost continent in 1941 to evacuate Americans at the beginning of [[World War II]]. She later served in patrol duty off the coast of [[Greenland]] for the [[United States Navy]]. Between some of these missions, she was a museum ship in [[Oakland, California]] and starred in the 1930 film version of [[Jack London]]'s ''[[The Sea-Wolf]]''.

After World War II, ''Bear'' was returned to use again as a sealing vessel. Finally, in 1963, 89 years after she had been built, while being towed to a stationary assignment as a [[floating restaurant]] in [[Philadelphia]], ''Bear'' foundered and sank in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] about {{convert|100|mi}} east of [[Cape Sable Island]], [[Nova Scotia]].

==Construction and sealing career==
''Bear'' was built in 1874 as a sealer at Dundee, Scotland shipyards. Custom-built for sealing out of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's, Newfoundland]],  ''Bear'' was the most outstanding sealing vessel of her day, the lead ship in a new generation of sealers.&lt;ref&gt;Tod, Giles, M.S., ''Last Sail Down East'', Barre Publishers, (1965) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy-built with {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on|1|spell=in}} thick wooden planks, ''Bear'' was rigged as a sailing [[barquentine]] but her main power was a steam engine designed to smash deep into ice packs to reach seal herds. At the time of her arrival in St. John's, there were 300 vessels outfitted each season to hunt seals, but most were small [[schooner]]s or old sailing [[barque]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Shannon, ''The Ice Hunters: A History of Newfoundland Sealing to 1914'' (1994) Breakwater Books Ltd. {{ISBN|1-55081-095-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The new sealing ships represented by ''Bear'' radically transformed the Eastern North Atlantic seal fishery as they replaced the hundreds of smaller sealing vessels owned by merchants in [[outport]]s around Newfoundland with large and expensive steamships owned by large British and Newfoundland companies based in St. John's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/sealing_disaster.html "1914 Sealing Disaster", Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage'']&lt;/ref&gt; Owned at first by the Scottish firm W. Grieve and Sons, she was acquired in 1880 by R. Steele Junior.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyds Register'' 1875-1883&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bear'' spent a decade sealing from St. John. In 1884, the Steeles sent ''Bear'' back to Scotland for a refit.

==American government service==
[[File:Loading Reindeer on U.S.S. Bear, c.1896.jpg|thumb|left|Men loading Reindeer onto USRC ''Bear''.]]

The massive wooden hulls of Newfoundland sealing vessels had proved ideal for arctic exploration. Just back from her refit in 1884 and ready for another season of sealing, ''Bear'' was instead purchased by the US government in 1884 and took part in the search for the [[Lady Franklin Bay Expedition]], whose seven survivors were found at [[Cape Sabine]].

From 1885 to 1926, ''Bear'' served as a [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] cutter, making the seasonal trek each May from her port in [[Oakland, California]] to sail north to [[Alaska|Alaskan]] waters for the five month season, cruising 10,000 miles on Bering Sea Patrol, where she looked out for seal poachers, shipwrecked whalers, and illicit trade with [[Alaska Natives]], ferried reindeer from [[Siberia]] to Alaska, and served as a floating courthouse.&lt;ref name=Bear1885/&gt; By order of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]], ''Bear'' was given free run to arrest and seize possessions of poachers, smugglers and illegal traders, as well as take census of people and ships, record geological and astronomical information, take note of tides, and escort whaling ships.

One captain of ''Bear'', [[Michael A. Healy|Michael "Hell Roaring Mike" Healy]], was considered a savior by many of the whalers and native Eskimos, as he bought Siberian reindeer at his own expense for the starving natives to use as the foundation for a new herd in Alaska, paralleling, and possibly in cooperation with, missionary [[Sheldon Jackson]]. Healy was the first African-American commissioned officer in U.S. history, and during Captain Healy's and ''Bear''{{'}}s 1891 Bering Sea Patrol, the following was accomplished:
* secured witnesses for a murder trial
* ferried reindeer
* sailed the Alaskan governor
* transported a U.S. Geographical survey team
* carried lumber and supplies for school construction in remote areas
* delivered teachers to their remote assignments
* delivered mail for the Postal Service
* enforced federal laws
* provided medical support to natives
* conducted search and rescue&lt;ref&gt;[http://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2013/02/a-bear-of-a-sea-story/ ''A Bear of a sea story''], Coast Guard Compass:  Official Blog of the U.S. Coast Guard, , February 12, 2013. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During one of its yearly trips back to San Francisco, ''Bear'' assisted in rescue operations for 1906 San Francisco earthquake.
The Revenue Cutter Service was merged with the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] to form the [[United States Coast Guard]] on 28 January 1915 and the ship was renamed USCGC ''Bear''.{{#tag:ref|After 28 January 1915 the Revenue Cutter Service was merged with the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] to form the [[United States Coast Guard]]. The prefix for Revenue Cutter Service vessels was changed from USRC to USCGC, thus; USRC ''Bear'' became USCGC ''Bear''.&lt;ref name=USCG1915&gt;"Coast Guard General Order No. 1", Historic Documents &amp; Publications, U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

==''Bear of Oakland''==
Cruising to Alaska for her last patrol in the 1926 season, on her return to Oakland that November she was replaced by a new cutter, {{USCGC|Northland|WPG-49|6}} and ownership was transferred to the city for use as a large [[barkentine]] rigged museum ship,&lt;ref&gt;[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1927-03-27/ed-1/seq-73/#date1=1924&amp;index=0&amp;rows=20&amp;words=Bear+Oakland&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1928&amp;proxtext=%22bear+of+oakland%22&amp;y=3&amp;x=12&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 ''The (Washington) Evening Star'', March 27, 1927, p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bear'' starred as the sealer ''Macedonia'' in the 1930 film version of Jack London's ''[[The Sea Wolf (1930 film)|The Sea-Wolf]]''.&lt;ref name="Burroughs 1970"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burroughs |first1=Polly |title=The Great Ice Ship Bear: Eighty-Nine Years in Polar Seas |date=1970 |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold |pages=104 |accessdate=27 June 2018 |ref=ASIN: B0006CA9LC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932 ''Bear of Oakland'' was purchased by Rear Admiral [[Richard E. Byrd]] for $1,050, as a replacement for the barquentine {{ship||City of New York|1885 ship|2}}.  He used her in the [[Richard E.

After the expedition, Admiral Byrd leased ''Bear'' to the Navy for one dollar a year, for use on his government sponsored (third) expedition.&lt;ref name="Lynch"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lynch Jr. |first1=Joseph |title=A Philatelic Introduction to B.A.E.

==United States Antarctic Service Expedition==
On 11 September 1939 she was re-commissioned in the U.S. Navy for service during the 1939–1941 [[United States Antarctic Service Expedition]], led by Rear Admiral [[Richard E. Byrd]], and renamed USS ''Bear'' (AG-29). She carried a [[Barkley-Grow]] [[Barkley-Grow T8P-1|seaplane]] on board.&lt;ref&gt;http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/pastIssues/2004-2005/2004_11_28.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Commander [[Richard H. Cruzen]] was captain of ''Bear'' during the expedition. Cruzen would rise to the rank of [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] and commanded the U.S. Navy ships which participated in a large Antarctic expedition named [[Operation Highjump]] in 1948.

In early 1941, USS ''Bear'' assisted in the evacuation of the members of the Antarctic Expedition, as international tensions rose in the months that led up to America's entrance into [[World War II]]. ''Bear'' arrived at the [[Mikkelsen Islands]], just north of the [[Antarctic Circle]], on 16 March 1941, and its crew helped to build an adequate [[airstrip]] to evacuate personnel and equipment from the expedition base in the area.

==World War II==
From 1941 to 1944, USS ''Bear'' served in the Northeast Atlantic [[Greenland Patrol]].  The rigging was cut down to two masts to become a fully motorized ship. After the capture, on 12 September 1941, of the German-controlled Norwegian sealer {{SS|Buskø||2}}, which was used as a supply ship for secret weather stations, by {{USCGC|Northland|WPG-49|6}}, ''Bear'' towed the [[Prize law|prize]] to Boston.&lt;ref name=NHHC01&gt;{{cite web|title=Northland (WPG-49)|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/n6/northland.htm|work=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships (DANFS)|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When more modern ships were available to replace her, ''Bear'' was decommissioned on 17 May 1944 and laid up in Boston until the end of the war.&lt;ref name=NHHC02&gt;{{cite web|title=Bear|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/b4/bear-i.htm|work=Dictionary of American Fighting Ships (DANFS)|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bear'' had the distinction of being the oldest U.S. Navy ship to be deployed outside the continental United States during World War II. She was also one of a very few U.S. Navy ships to have served during the [[Spanish–American War]] as well as both world wars. (The sailing relics {{USS|Constitution}} and {{USS|Constellation|1854|6}} were both in active commissioned service during World War II but neither left port during the war.)

==Postwar==
''Bear'' was purchased from the US government in 1948 by Frank M. Shaw of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] for $5,199. Shaw intended to use the ship for sealing. Renamed ''Arctic Bear'', her refit for sealing proved costly and with the decline of the large-scale Newfoundland seal hunt, she was laid up in [[Halifax Harbour]] subject to on and off again refits, and lay derelict for periods of times as she remained at various moorings around Halifax and [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]].

By the early 1960s ''Bear'' was considered for restoration as a museum ship by the City of Dartmouth as well as her old home at Oakland and by the [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park|San Francisco marine museum]].&lt;ref&gt;"Famed Exploration Ship May Be Marine Museum", ''Halifax Mail'', 28 March 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  However the purchase price from Shaw Steamships and the extensive restoration costs scuttled museum plans.&lt;ref&gt;"Bear Project Scuttled. Vessel Refit Too Costly", ''Chronicle Herald'', 19 April 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 she was purchased by Alfred Johnston of Philadelphia for a floating seafood restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;Bixby, William , ''Track of the Bear'', p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Repairs were made to the ship at Industrial Shipping Limited in [[Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia]] for her new role including the carving of a new bear figurehead.

==Sinking==
In 1963, while in tow by the tug ''Irving Birch'' to Philadelphia, ''Bear'' foundered about {{convert|100|nmi}} east of [[Cape Sable Island]], Nova Scotia, at {{coord|42|40|N|065|11|W|name=SS ''Arctic Bear''}}. She went down early in the morning of 19 March 1963 after a gale struck and severed the tow line. The mast collapsed and punctured the hull, causing the sinking. Her crew of two were rescued by ''Irving Birch''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/wrecks/wrecks/shipwrecks.asp?ID=565# |title="Bear-1963", ''On the Rocks Shipwreck Database'' Nova Scotia Museum |access-date=2 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927161639/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/wrecks/wrecks/shipwrecks.asp?ID=565# |archive-date=27 September 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Bear''{{'}}s exceptional career lasted for 89 years.  She spent a total of 47 years in commissioned service of the United States Revenue Cutter Service, Coast Guard and Navy. She served under the flags of three different nations (United Kingdom, United States and Canada).  She was one of only a few ships to have served in both arctic regions.

There is a large detailed scale model of ''Bear'' on display in the Stockton Center for International Law, part of the [[United States Naval War College]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].

The figurehead from ''Bear'' is in the collection at the [[Mariners' Museum]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]].

In 1956, the United States, Canada and Mexico came to an agreement with the [[American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators]], the [[Automobile Manufacturers Association]] and the [[National Safety Council]] that standardized the size for license plates for vehicles (except those for [[motorcycle]]s) at {{convert|6|in|cm}} in height by {{convert|12|in|cm}} in width, with standardized mounting holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Garrish |first=Christopher |date=October 2016 |title=Reconsidering the Standard Plate Size |magazine=Plates |publisher=[[Automobile License Plate Collectors Association]] |volume=62 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guam adopted these standards in 1960.

===Non-passenger===
On the 1994 base, commercial [[truck]] plates were coded by location of issuance, but using a different geographical coding system than for passenger plates. These codes were based on more specific geographical areas or geographical features, rather than political jurisdictions.

Bus, dealer, taxi, and trailer plates were coded only by type, not location of issuance.
