The '''Agrarian Party of Moldova''' ({{lang-ro|Partidul Agrar din Moldova}}, PAM), formerly the '''Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova''' (''Partidul Democrat Agrar din Moldova'', PDAM), is a [[Moldova]]n political party, prominent from 1991 to 1998. Governing for most of this period, the party represented a large centrist multi-ethnic bloc led by former [[Collective farming|collective farm]] chairmen and village mayors. These reformed Communists were motivated more by patronage than ideology and committed to maintaining their positions of power in the privatised agricultural and agro-industrial sector. To its right stood the pan-[[Romania]]ns of the [[Popular Front of Moldova|Popular Front]], and to its left, the [[Socialist Unity Bloc|Socialists]] and later the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|Communists]].&lt;ref&gt;King, p.164&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Agrarian Party traces its origins to a parliamentary club numbering 60 deputies and called ''Viaţa Satului'' ("The Life of the Village"), set up in April 1990.&lt;ref name="Partidul"/&gt; The party was formally created in November 1991, three months after Moldova's independence from the [[Soviet Union]]; [[Dumitru Moţpan]] was its first president. At the time, the sitting [[Parliament of the Republic of Moldova|Moldovan Parliament]] was the one elected in 1990, when non-Communist parties were still banned, and deputies freely entered and exited nascent parties in a chaotic environment.&lt;ref&gt;King, p.154&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the PDAM, with its clear policy orientation, institutional power base and good organisation, quickly gained the most seats and became the effective governing party, standing at the centre of the national unity government formed in mid-1992 following the end of hostilities in the [[War of Transnistria]].&lt;ref&gt;Siaroff, p.354&lt;/ref&gt; Composed largely of the former Communist agricultural and agro-industrial elite, the party championed Moldovan sovereignty, opposing attempts to join Romania and Russia. For a time, its most radical members rejected the Front's description of Moldovans' ethnicity and language as ''Romanian'', maintaining the Soviet view of an ethnic distinction between [[Romanians]] and [[Moldovans]]. By 1994, this ideology, sometimes called [[Moldovenism]], had become a central tenet of the party's platform. It was notably promoted in a speech by the party's most prominent spokesman at the time, [[President of Moldova|President]] [[Mircea Snegur]], marking a shift from his earlier more pro-Romanian stance.&lt;ref&gt;King, p.154-55&lt;/ref&gt;

The speech undoubtedly helped propel the Agrarian Democrats to victory in the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 1994|February 1994 election]], the country's first since independence. The Front's weakening since 1990 had already shown the unpopularity of pan-Romanian notions, and Snegur's rhetoric was against union with Romania and in favour of independence and territorial integrity. At the election, the Front finished in last place of the parties elected and the PDAM's 43.2% of the vote translated into an absolute majority in parliament (56 of 104 seats).&lt;ref&gt;King, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; Further confirming the popularity of government policy, at [[Moldovan referendum, 1994|a referendum]] the following month, 95.4% voted that Moldova should remain an "independent and unitary state",&lt;ref&gt;King, p.159&lt;/ref&gt; while at the 1995 local elections, the party scored 47% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;King, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1994 election, the Agrarians reversed a number of Frontist reforms enacted a few years earlier. Parliament voted to drop "[[Deşteaptă-te, române!]]", used in Romania as well, as the national anthem. The [[Constitution of Moldova]], adopted by Parliament in July 1994, describes that state language as the "Moldovan language" and makes no reference to its relationship with Romanian, as did the 1989 language laws. Language tests mandated for state employees by those laws were suspended, and the State Department of Languages, which had previously conducted "raids" on institutions to ensure employees knew the official language, virtually shut down. These measures ended language as a major political issue and made Moldova ''de facto'' bilingual.&lt;ref&gt;King, p.159-60&lt;/ref&gt; The party also supported autonomy for the [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]], which soon manifested itself in the creation of [[Gagauzia]].&lt;ref&gt;King, p.218&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it backed closer relations with [[Russia]] and the former Soviet republics, calling for participation in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]' economic structures but not its political or military ones (Moldova joined the CIS in 1994), and advocating permanent neutrality and the banning of foreign troops from the country (then as now stationed in [[Transnistria]]). The PDAM wished for a slow transition to capitalism,&lt;ref&gt;Siaroff, p.355&lt;/ref&gt; continuing market reforms but with generous subsidies and credits for agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Asher, p.119&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the linguistic compromises reached in 1994, the matter did resurface in March 1995, when mass student demonstrations called for the constitution to recognise the language as "Romanian" and not "Moldovan". Snegur showed his support for these demands in a speech the following month delivered in order to differentiate himself in the [[Moldovan presidential election, 1996|upcoming presidential election]]. Soon afterwards, Snegur and his rival, parliament chairman [[Petru Lucinschi]], formed their own parties, the former appealing to right and centre-right ethnic Moldovans; the latter to left-wing Moldovans and Slavs. A number of PDAM deputies defected to Snegur's new party, forcing the Agrarians to rely on support from the Slavic-dominated Socialist Unity Bloc. The third major candidate was Prime Minister [[Andrei Sangheli]], who remained a leader of the Agrarian Democrats. A victorious Lucinschi was able to push through an ambitious privatisation programme in 1997 despite much resistance from the PDAM and their Slavic allies, although at the Agrarians' insistence, [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] ballooned and privatisation and restructuring in that sector remained slow.&lt;ref&gt;Asher, p.119-20&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agrarian Democrats collapsed at the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 1998|March 1998 election]], taking 3.6% of the vote and failing to enter parliament. Two main reasons were the cause: economic malaise and the fading of the ethnic issue allowed for a Communist resurgence, and disputes among PDAM sympathizers Snegur, Lucinschi and Sangheli caused internal division.&lt;ref&gt;King, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, with Snegur's party occupying the centre-right, Lucinschi's the centre and the Communists the far left, the moderate leftists of the PDAM were outflanked, having alienated Moldovan peasants by allying with Slavs against the popular Lucinschi and opposing the transformation of collective farms into private ones.&lt;ref&gt;Asher, p.120-21&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2001, three alliances governed together mainly as a way to block the Communists, who won the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 2001|election that year]].&lt;ref&gt;King, p.163&lt;/ref&gt; There, the PDAM took 1.2% of the vote, failing to regain ground at the 2003 local elections.&lt;ref&gt;Anatoly Kulik and Susanna Pshizova, ''Political Parties in Post-Soviet Space'', p.92. 2005, Greenwood Publishing Group. {{ISBN|0-275-97344-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the party's 8th congress in July 2004, its name was changed to its current form, and despite preparations to do so, it failed to contest the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 2005|2005 election]]. Now led by Anatol Popuşoi, it has some 10,000 members.&lt;ref name="Partidul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.e-democracy.md/parties/pam/ Partidul Agrar din Moldova (PAM)], Elections 2005 in Moldova&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, April 2009|April 2009 election]], it supported the ruling [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|Communists]], with Popuşoi being included on that party's list of candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-democracy.md/en/elections/parliamentary/2009/electoral-news/20090211/ Election News from February 11, 2009], e-democracy.md&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue Between Cultures''' is a network of civil society organisations dedicated to promoting intercultural dialogue in the Mediterranean region.

It was set up in 2005 by the governments of the [[Euro-Mediterranean Partnership]] (Euromed), a political agreement made in 1995 between the [[European Union]] and  Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, Syria and Turkey.

It is named in honour of [[Anna Lindh]], the Swedish Foreign Minister who was murdered in 2003. The name was put forward by Egypt at a meeting 25 September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= EU and the Mediterranean : Foreign Policy and Security |last= Seeberg |first= Peter |author2= Michele Pace |year= 2007 |publisher= University Press of Southern Denmark |isbn= 978-87-7674-220-1 |page= 136 |chapter= Meddling or Muddling with the Mediterranean?

{{Anti-austerity movement in the European Union}}
The '''anti-austerity movement''' refers to the mobilisation of [[street protest]]s and [[grassroots]] campaigns that has happened across various countries, especially in [[Europe]], since the onset of the worldwide [[Great Recession]].

Anti-austerity actions are varied and ongoing, and can be either sporadic and loosely organised or longer-term and tightly organised. They continue as of the present day. The global [[Occupy movement]] has arguably been the most noticeable physical enactment of anti-austerity and [[Populism|populist]] sentiment.

==Ireland==
An example of countries implementing severe austerity measures is [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Ireland witnessed its housing market completely (rather than, as elsewhere, partially) collapse, and the government eventually had to apply for a [[bailout]] from the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), agreeing to an austerity program of economic reform in exchange. The austerity measures and the terms of the IMF bailout became major aspects of the [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|Irish financial crisis]], and populist anger over these issues played a major role in the loss of governmental power of [[Fianna Fáil]] to opposition parties in the [[Irish general election, 2011|2011 Irish general election]]. The loss for Fianna Fáil was so great that many commentators remarked that the results were "historic". [[Fine Gael]] and the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] formed a [[coalition government]], and Fine Gael promised to re-negotiate the terms of the IMF bailout end the austerity programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Enda-Kenny-and-Eamon-Gilmore-will-renegotiate-EU-bailout-117573543.html|title=Enda Kenny and Eamon Gilmore will renegotiate EU bailout|date=8 March 2011|work=IrishCentral.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sinn Féin]], which for the first time won a notable percentage in the election, called for a nationwide [[referendum]] over whether the bailout agreement should be scrapped altogether. Labour dismissed this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/bacik-dismisses-sinn-fein-calls-for-bailout-referendum-497233.html|title=Bacik dismisses Sinn Féin calls for bailout referendum|work=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=14 March 2011|accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of smaller parties, such as the [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist]]s, [[People Before Profit Alliance]], the [[Workers and Unemployed Action Group|WUAG]] and [[Independent politician|Independent]]s involved themselves in the [[Campaign Against Home and Water Taxes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1222/310212-householdcharge/|title=Campaign against property tax plans launched|work=[[RTÉ News]]|date=22 December 2011|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political impact==
[[File:2011 Greece Uprising.jpg|thumb|100,000 anti-austerity protesters in front of the [[Hellenic Parliament|Greek parliament]] in 2011]]
Since the onset of the [[Great Recession in Europe|economic recession in Europe]], the political establishment response has increasingly focused on austerity: attempts to bring down budget deficits and control the rise of debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssrp.cshss.cam.ac.uk/projects/austerity|title=The consequences of the politics of austerity in the European Union|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-austerity movement has responded by giving rise to a wave of anti-establishment political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/27/anti-austerity-movements-europe|title=Anti-austerity movements gaining momentum across Europe|date=27 April 2012|accessdate=14 January 2015|publisher=''The Guardian''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to austerity is seen as the force behind the rise of [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in Spain, Italy's [[Five Star Movement]] and the [[Syriza]] party in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/out-of-the-fringe-and-into-the-spotlight-european-austerity-breeds-radical-politics/article21462957/|title=From fringe to spotlight: European austerity breeds radical politics|date=5 November 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015|publisher=''The Globe and Mail''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|Scottish independence referendum]] in 2014, the [[Scottish Government]] pledged to end austerity in an independent Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27868468|title=Scottish independence: Post-Yes Scotland 'to end austerity'|date=16 June 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Thomas Piketty]] welcomed the political reaction to austerity, saying the rise of anti-austerity parties is "good news for Europe". According to Piketty, European countries tried to get rid of their deficits too quickly, resulting in a situation where "their citizens have suffered the consequences in the shape of austerity policies. It's good to reduce deficits, but at a rate that's commensurate with growth and economic recovery, but here growth has been killed off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/12/thomas-piketty-austerity-europe-greece-spain|title=Thomas Piketty: rise of anti-austerity parties good news for Europe|date=12 January 2015|accessdate=14 January 2015|publisher=''The Guardian''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[2011 Spanish protests]], whose participants are sometimes referred to as the "''indignados''", are a series of ongoing anti-austerity demonstrations in [[Spain]] that rose to prominence beginning on 15 May 2011; thus, the movement is also sometimes referred to as the ''May 15'' or ''M-15'' movement as well. It is a collection of several different instances of continuous demonstrations countrywide, with a common origin in internet [[social networks]] and the [[Democracia Real Ya]] web presence, along with 200 other small associations.&lt;ref name="art1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2011/05/16/actualidad/1305578500_751064.html |title=Movimiento 15-M: los ciudadanos exigen reconstruir la política (15-M Movement: citizens demand political reconstruction) |publisher=Politica.elpais.com |date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2011-05-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110522114151/http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2011/05/16/actualidad/1305578500_751064.html| archivedate= 22 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In late March 2011 the Portuguese Prime Minister resigned a few hours after the latest austerity bill he backed was rejected by the rest of government. The government called that particular austerity round unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12841492 | work=BBC News | title=Portugal PM Jose Socrates resigns after budget rejected | date=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his resignation speech, [[José Sócrates]] expressed concern that an IMF bailout akin to Greece and Ireland would now be unavoidable.
* In mid-March 2011 the [[British Medical Association]] held an emergency meeting at which it broadly decided to emphatically oppose pending legislation in the [[British Parliament]], the [[Health and Social Care Bill 2011|Health and Social Care Bill]], that would overhaul the functioning of the [[National Health Service]]. Dr Layla Jader, a public health physician, said: "The NHS needs evolution not revolution - these reforms are very threatening to the future of the NHS. If they go through, our children will look back and say how could you allow this to happen?" And Dr Barry Miller, an anaethetist from [[Bolton]], added: "The potential to do phenomenal damage is profound.

* The [[2010 UK student protests]] mark the coming into force of one of the [[United Kingdom]]'s most severe austerity measures. On 9 December 2010 spending for [[higher education]] and tuition subsidies and assistance in [[England|English]] [[universities]] — historically rather substantial in scale — was cut by a total of 80%.&lt;ref name="Mulholland"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/dec/09/tuition-fee-progressive-cable-mps-vote|title=Lib Dem parliamentary aide quits over tuition fees as MPs prepare to vote|first=Hélène|last=Mulholland|work=guardian.co.uk|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=2010-12-09|accessdate=2011-01-04|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; That announcement and its implications, which included a near-tripling of student tuition fees from their previous levels&lt;ref name="thisisleicestershire.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/news/Lib-Dems-join-key-vote-tuition-fees-rise/article-2974808-detail/article.html|title=This Thursday will be one of the most important days in Parliament since the election, as MPs vote on the Government's plans for university tuition fees. - Leicester Mercury|work=Leicester Mercury}}&lt;/ref&gt; up to a new ceiling of £9000/year, led to a huge backlash amongst students who almost immediately took to the streets over various non-sequential days against this announcement, squaring off with police on several occasions including an instance where some students angrily entered the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] headquarters and smashed windows and destroyed its interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-11-10/world/uk.protest_1_universities-students-protest-tuition-fees?_s=PM:WORLD |work=CNN |title=California university students protest tuition hikes |date=18 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125063557/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-11-10/world/uk.protest_1_universities-students-protest-tuition-fees?_s=PM%3AWORLD |archivedate=25 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of the passage of the measure itself, there was an explosion of street violence by enraged students and their allies, especially in [[London]].

One such example is Bloomsbury Fightback!, which is a group of radical students and workers in [[Bloomsbury, London]],  centred on the Bloomsbury Colleges in the [[University of London]] and focusing on organising around education and employment issues, of which many are the result of the austerity measures.
* The group [[UK Uncut]] is one outgrowth of the anger felt by average citizens at austerity, albeit the group focuses not so much on combating the cuts themselves as on demanding that the rich, rather than the poor, pay the shortfalls causing the austerity in the first place — a sort of "tax the rich" movement. UK Uncut attempts to organise [[flash mob]] protests inside the highest-profile buildings of the businesses of the rich people avoiding tax or paying less than they should.

* Around the same time as the heating-up of the England protests (but before the passing of the bill), students in Italy occupied the [[leaning tower of Pisa]] in a similar protest regarding its own educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11841199 | work=BBC News | title=Italian student protesters occupy Leaning Tower of Pisa | date=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 27 November 2010, a massive protest against pending austerity took place in [[Dublin]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thirdage.com/news/dublin-unions-protest-harsh-austerity-plan_11-27-2010 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130080054/http://www.thirdage.com/news/dublin-unions-protest-harsh-austerity-plan_11-27-2010 |archivedate=30 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Irish Examiner]]'' news service also reports on a 7 December 2010 clash around the [[Dáil]] where protesters threw smoke bombs and flares at police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://budget.breakingnews.ie/news/protesters-target-dail-over-cuts-484837.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209180023/http://budget.breakingnews.ie/news/protesters-target-dail-over-cuts-484837.html |archivedate=9 December 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[La Scala]] in Italy experienced a clash on 8 December 2010 including scuffles with police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11947131 | work=BBC News | title=Italian cuts spark fight at the opera for La Scala | date=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* More generally, throughout 2009 and 2010, workers and students in Greece and other European countries demonstrated against cuts to pensions, public services and education spending as a result of [[government]] austerity measures.&lt;ref name="Thestar"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/article/802042|title=In Greece you get a bonus for showing up for work - Arcane benefits add billions to Greece’s bloated budget|last=Kyriakidou|first=Dina|date=4 August 2010|publisher=thestar.com|accessdate=29 September 2010|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a brief airport strike in [[Spain]] in December 2010, and assorted brief "general strike"-like actions in [[France]] have taken place, particularly around the very controversial plan of the French government to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62, a proposal which eventually successfully passed.
* Further protests [[2010–2011 Greek protests|taken place in Greece]], [[2011 Portuguese protests|Portugal]] and [[Anti-austerity movement in the United Kingdom|the UK]] have continued throughout 2011 and 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.austeritybill.co.uk/personal-financial-news/riots-in-greece-as-austerity-measures-start-to-bite.html |work=Austerity Bill |title=Riots in Greece as austerity measures start to bite |date=23 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904172633/http://www.austeritybill.co.uk/personal-financial-news/riots-in-greece-as-austerity-measures-start-to-bite.html |archivedate=4 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including in [[Nigeria]] with major large street clashes against the withdrawal of [[fuel subsidy|fuel subsidies]]. There was also a major protest in [[London]] by UK groups from across that country on 26 March 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/14/anti-cuts-campaigners-26-march | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Matthew | last=Taylor | title=Anti-cuts campaigners plan 'carnival of civil disobedience' | date=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  centred on a protest call initially made by the [[Trades Union Congress]] but subsequently involving many other groups.
* Participants in more militant forms of protest engaged in during 26 March demonstration, who in total only comprised 1,500 people out of the estimated 250,000-500,000 total participants, have been relentlessly attacked by the government as "mindless thugs"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12881734 | work=BBC News | title=Home Secretary Theresa May condemns protest 'thugs' | date=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the UK's [[mainstream media]] including the [[BBC]] generally supporting this perception. This remains the case even though the fundamental seriousness of damage thus far remains debatable; much reporting seems to have focused on the smashing of a [[Santander Group|Santander bank]] branch's glass entranceway doors by largely [[anarchist]] activists, who would have also been behind the simultaneous destruction of several [[automated teller machine]]s and the scrawling of "[[class conflict|class war]]" in [[graffiti]] on neighbouring walls.
* By July 2014 there was still anger and protests in Greece about the austerity measures implemented there, with a 24-hour strike among government workers on 9 July 2014, timed to coincide with an audit by inspectors from the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and European Central Bank.&lt;ref name="GreekStrike"&gt;{{cite news|title=State workers in Greece hold strike to protest layoffs|url=http://www.greekherald.com/index.php/sid/223650639/scat/48158b5a5afd369b/ht/State-workers-in-Greece-hold-strike-to-protest-layoffs|accessdate=9 July 2014|publisher=''Greek Herald''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2008–14 Irish protests|Protests]] continued and, indeed, escalated in Ireland in 2014, as the government attempted to implement additional water taxes to its austerity program, with at least one senior politician, the deputy prime minister, even being "kidnapped".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Barry|last1=Roche|first2=Ronan|last2=McGreevy|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/disgraceful-treatment-of-t%C3%A1naiste-effectively-kidnapping-says-taoiseach-1.2003922|title=‘Disgraceful’ treatment of Tánaiste effectively ‘kidnapping’, says Taoiseach|work=The Irish Times|date=17 November 2014|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 19 March 2015 – German demonstrators clashed with police at an anti-austerity protest during the inauguration ceremony for the European Central Bank's new headquarters in Frankfurt. Police put up barricades and barbed wire around the bank headquarters as they braced for demonstrations against government austerity measures and capitalism.

==Perspectives==
Some economists, like [[Nobel Prize]] winning [[Princeton University|Princeton]] economist [[Paul Krugman]], argue that austerity measures tend to be counterproductive when applied to the populations and programs they are usually applied to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/opinion/02krugman.html?scp=1&amp;sq=austerity&amp;st=Search | work=The New York Times | first=Paul | last=Krugman | title=Myths of Austerity | date=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the political sphere has been so heavily influenced by a paper known as "[[Growth in a Time of Debt]]"  based on flawed methodology has led  Krugman to argue:&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/opinion/krugman-the-excel-depression.html?_r=0 The Excel Depression]. The New York Times. 18 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;What the Reinhart–Rogoff affair shows is the extent to which austerity has been sold on false pretenses. For three years, the turn to austerity has been presented not as a choice but as a necessity. Economic research, austerity advocates insisted, showed that terrible things happen once debt exceeds 90 percent of G.D.P. But "economic research" showed no such thing; a couple of economists made that assertion, while many others disagreed. Policy makers abandoned the unemployed and turned to austerity because they wanted to, not because they had to.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October 2012, the [[International Monetary Fund]] announced that its forecasts for countries which implemented austerity programs have been consistently overoptimistic.&lt;ref name="PlumerIMF"&gt;Brad Plumer (12 October 2012) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/12/imf-austerity-is-much-worse-for-the-economy-than-we-thought/ "IMF: Austerity is much worse for the economy than we thought"] ''Washington Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bamboo torture''' is a possibly apocryphal form of [[torture]] and [[execution]] where a [[bamboo]] shoot grows through the body of a victim, reported to have been used in [[East Asia|East]] and [[South Asia]] but for which no reliable evidence exists.&lt;ref&gt;http://mentalfloss.com/article/23038/9-insane-torture-techniques&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recorded usage==
[[File:Big Bamboo Shoot (Joi Ito).jpg|thumb|right|Bamboo sprout. Some species can grow as fast as 4&amp;nbsp;cm per hour]]
A "Madras civilian", in his travel description from 1820s India, referred to this use of bamboo was a well known punishment in [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Madras civilian| editor =J. S. Buckingham | journal = Oriental Herald|volume= 15,47|date=November 1827|url = https://books.google.com/?id=7HMeAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA293|pages=293–299|title=Journey Across the Peninsula of India, from Madras to Bombay| publisher = Longman, Rees, Brown and Green| location = London }}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7HMeAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA296 p.296]&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], stories circulated of Japanese soldiers inflicting "bamboo torture" upon U.S. and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[prisoners of war]], where the victim was tied securely in place above a young bamboo shoot.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9IsBB-RVTlQC&amp;pg=PA11 ''The Other Empire: Literary Views of Japan from the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia'', UP Press, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Over several days, the sharp, fast-growing shoot would first puncture, then completely penetrate the victim's body, eventually emerging through the other side.&lt;ref&gt;As an example of popular promotion of this horror story, see for example:''WW2 People's War''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/37/a4865637.shtml Japanese Torture Techniques]&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese poet and author Woon-Ping Chin&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~asiam/faculty/chin.html Woon-Ping Chin]&lt;/ref&gt; mentions the "bamboo torture" as one of those tortures the locals believed the Japanese performed on prisoners in her memoir ''Hakka Soul''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Ping| first= Chin Woon| title= Hakka Soul| url= https://books.google.com/?id=7M1myRaf8xUC| year= 2008| publisher= NUS Press| isbn= 978-9971-69-400-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7M1myRaf8xUC p.23]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cast of the TV program ''[[MythBusters]]'' investigated bamboo torture in a [[MythBusters (2008 season)#Episode SP12&amp;nbsp;– "Viewer Special Threequel"|2008 episode]] and found that a bamboo shoot can penetrate through several inches of [[ballistic gelatin]] in three days. For research purposes, ballistic gelatin is considered comparable to human flesh, and the experiment thus supported the ''viability'' of this form of torture, not its ''historicity''.

However, this tale of using live trees impaling persons as they grow is not confined to the context of World War II and the Japanese as torturers, but was recorded in the 19th century, when [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] alleged that the [[Thai people|Siamese]] used the sprout of the [[Nypa fruticans|nipah palm]] in the manner of bamboo torture during the 1821 [[Siamese invasion of Kedah]] among other punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Osborn| first= Sherard| title= My journal in Malayan waters| url= https://books.google.com/?id=G4A2AAAAMAAJ| year= 1861| publisher= Routledge, Warne, and Routledge| location= London}},[https://books.google.com/books?jtp=190&amp;id=G4A2AAAAMAAJ p.&amp;nbsp;190–94]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jXUMAQAAIAAJ ''The Japan Science Review: Humanistic studies'', Volumes 6-10, 1955 - Dissertations, Academic]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A9RwAAAAMAAJ ''Sejarah Pahang'', Buyong bin Adil (Haji.), Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, Kementerian Pelajaran, Malaysia, 1984 - Pahang - 461 pages]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boanerges de Souza Massa''' (born January 7, 1938 - disappeared June 21, 1972) was a [[Brazil]]ian [[physician]] who joined the [[Resistance movement|resistance]] against the [[military dictatorship in Brazil|military dictatorship]]. He was the field surgeon of the [[Ação Libertadora Nacional|National Liberation Action]] ({{lang-pt|Ação Libertadora Nacional}}, ''ALN'') founded by [[Carlos Marighella]]. After the police liquidated Marighella, he went to [[Cuba]] to take [[guerilla]] courses and co-founded the [[:pt:Movimento de Libertação Popular|People's Liberation Movement]] ({{lang-pt|Movimento de Libertação Popular Brasileiro}}, ''MOLIPO''). The army captured him in 1971 in [[Pindorama]] and he [[forced disappearance|disappeared]] shortly thereafter. 25 years later, the Brazilian government officially acknowledged its responsibility.

== Biographical record ==
Boanerges de Souza Massa was born on January 7, 1938 in [[Avaré]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], to Francisco de Souza Massa and Laura Alves 
Massa. He married Maria Lucia Sant'Anna Saadi Kerbeg in [[São Paulo]] on January 9, 1969. In the 1980s the authorities granted her a divorce because her husband had disappeared for a decade.&lt;ref&gt;Biography of [http://verdadeaberta.org/mortos-desaparecidos/boanerges-de-souza-massa Boanerges de Souza Massa] by the [[Truth and reconciliation commission|Truth Commission]] of the State of São Paulo.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s the authorities granted Boanerges' brother Cyro Massa a 100,000 [[Brazilian real|reais]] compensation because his brother had disappeared for two decades after being in government custody.&lt;ref name="d2318"&gt;[https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto/1997/d2318.htm Presidential Decree No. 2.318.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Boanerges de Souza Massa was born in a rural area and worked as teacher and accountant to pay for his studies. He was admitted to the Medicine School and the [[Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo|Law School]] of the [[University of São Paulo]]. He graduated from the former in December 1965 and the latter in June 1966. He [[Internship (medicine)|interned]] at the [[Hospital das Clínicas da Universidade de São Paulo|University of São Paulo Faculty of Medicine Clinics Hospital]].&lt;ref name="where"&gt;"Where is Boanerges?" by Ulisses de Souza, [http://www.apm.org.br/revista-apm.aspx Review] of the [http://www.apm.org.br/ Association of Medicine of São Paulo], [http://www.apm.org.br/imagens/Pdfs/2006-10-APM%20572.pdf No. 572, October 2006], Special Edition: [[National Doctors' Day|Doctors' Day]], pp. 6-11.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the co-author of a published academic research article on [[leptospirosis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revistas.usp.br/revistadc/article/download/58336/61338 Review of Medicine], Vol. 47, No. 3 (1963), pp. 190-192&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1962, Boanerges was invited to speak to [[John F. Kennedy]] on the lawn of the [[White House]] as part of a delegation of the [[Alliance for Progress]]. A journalist reported: "Wagging his finger, the student from Avaré questioned the President of the United States on his interference in poor countries." In medical school he was designated as [[Graduation|commencement]] speaker for the Class of 1965, but his speech was censored for being critical of the military dictatorship.&lt;ref name="where" /&gt;

==Doctor of the ALN==
Over the years, Boanerges de Souza Massa gravitated towards the militant group [[Ação Libertadora Nacional]] (ALN). On May 8, 1969, the ALN robbed a bank and killed a policeman, but one of their members, Takao Amano, was wounded. It was Boanerges who gave him emergency medical care and extracted the bullet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ternuma.com.br/index.php/noticias/2106-a-historia-do-terrorismo-no-brasil A History of Terrorism in Brazil], Chapter 27, Group ''Terrorismo Nunca Mais''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 1969, the ALM conducted another bank robbery, leaving one soldier dead. Two bullets wounded Francisco Gomes da Silva, the brother of ALN leader Virgilio Gomes da Silva (codename ''Jonas'' in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated movie [[Four Days in September]] about the kidnapping of US ambassador [[Charles Burke Elbrick]]). Boanerges, along with the rest of the ALN commando, hijacked a hospital to treat the wounded. This 4-hour operation was medically successful, but Boanerges was recognized by the hospital staff and forced into clandestinity.&lt;ref&gt;"Polícia tem uma pista do assaltante baleado," [[O Estado de S. Paulo]], Saturday June 7, 1969, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of 1969, the most actively sought-after opponents to the military dictatorship became known as the "[[Carlos Marighella|Marighella]] 7", among which Boanerges. He escaped from Brazil thanks to false identity papers provided by [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]].&lt;ref name="CRDD"&gt;Biography of [http://www.desaparecidospoliticos.org.br/pessoa.php?id=1579 Boanerges de Souza Massa]  by the Commission of Relatives of Dead and Disappeared.&lt;/ref&gt; Traveling through [[Uruguay]], Boanerges linked up in [[Argentina]] with other ALN operatives, and they hijacked an airplane to fly to [[Cuba]] where they took refuge.&lt;ref&gt;"À procura do pai - um ex-guerrilheiro desaparecido," by Luiz Maklouf Carvalho, [[Jornal da Tarde]], September 16, 1997, p. 6A.&lt;/ref&gt;

==MOLIPO==
In Cuba, Boanerges de Souza Massa lived with other exiled Brazilians in a house provided by the [[Cuba|Castro regime]]. They took guerilla classes: physical training in the morning, political in the afternoon. Their goal was to return to Brazil and liberate their country from the [[military dictatorship in Brazil|military dictatorship]]. To this end they formed a new [[Marxist]] revolutionary organization, the '''MOLIPO''', abbreviation of [[:pt:Movimento de Libertação Popular|Movimento de Libertação Popular]] (in English: ''People's Liberation Movement'').&lt;ref name="CRDD" /&gt;

Boanerges de Souza Massa was the first MOLIPO operative to be sent back to Brazil to establish a rural guerilla base in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast region]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.averdadesufocada.com/images/orvil/orvil_completo.pdf The black book of terrorism in Brazil], Army Information Center, 1988, p. 605.&lt;/ref&gt; But [[counter-insurgency]] forces were aware of his return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://verdadeaberta.org/upload/004-informacao-850.pdf Confidential Note No. 850] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307053643/http://verdadeaberta.org/upload/004-informacao-850.pdf# |date=2016-03-07 }}, Ministry of Aeronautics, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to be captured, in [[Pindorama]], on December 21, 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mvjtocantins.com.br/administracao/files/files/Cartilha_Ditadura%20no%20Tocantins_Site_.pdf The dictatorship in Tocantins]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Center for Human Rights of [[Palmas, Tocantins|Palmas]], 2015, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the sociologist Renato Dias:{{quote |text=A document from the National Archive says that the capture of Boanerges de Souza Massa accelerated the dismantlement of the [MOLIPO] group...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornalopcao.com.br/posts/reportagens/assim-liquidaram-o-molipo How the MOLIPO was liquidated], by Renato Dias, ''Jornal Opção'', No. 1934, July 29 to August 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The final outcome was a crushing defeat for the MOLIPO: at least 60% of its cadre died or disappeared at the hands of the military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ternuma.com.br/index.php/2013-08-22-03-34-31/436-movimento-de-libertacao-popular-molipo Movimento de Libertação Popular (MOLIPO)], by Felix Maier, Group ''Terrorismo Nunca Mais''.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the rare survivors was [[José Dirceu]], who entered mainstream politics after Brazil's 1985 [[History of Brazil since 1985|transition to democracy]] and became the chief-of-staff of left-leaning President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] (commonly called ''Lula'').

==Disappearance==
As for the fate of Boanerges himself, according to the ''Special Commission on Political Deaths and Disappearances'':{{quote |text=Among all the Brazilian political disappearances, the case of Boanerges de Souza Massa is one of those most surrounded by doubts, mysteries and controversies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/portugues/tematica/livros/diversos/memoria.pdf The right to memory and truth], Special Commission on Political Deaths and Disappearances, Brasilia: Secretariat for Human Rights of the Presidency of the Republic, 2007, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;}}He was seen in prison by other political prisoners, but his arrest was never officially registered by the security organs of the military regime. As late as 1995, his name was not on the official list of dead and missing political activists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/portugues/tematica/livros/diversos/mortos.pdf Dossier of dead and missing political activists since 1964], Institute for the Study of State Violence, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; A declassified Army document says that he was physically impaired to the point that his identification would be difficult.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnv.gov.br/images/pdf/publicacoes/claudio/publicacoes_operacao_ilha.pdf Operation Island], report contributed by the former [[Attorney General]] of the [[Republic of Brazil]] Claudio Fonteles to the [[National Truth Commission]] on January 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His body was never found.

The '''British National Party''' ('''BNP''') is a [[Far-right politics|far-right]], [[Fascism|fascist]] [[list of political parties in the United Kingdom|political party in the United Kingdom]]. It is headquartered in [[Wigton]], [[Cumbria]], and its current leader is [[Adam Walker (British politician)|Adam Walker]]. A [[minor party]], it has no elected representatives at any level of UK government. Founded in 1982, the party reached its greatest level of success in the 2000s, when it had over fifty seats in local government, one seat on the [[London Assembly]], and two [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]].

Taking its name from that of a [[British National Party (1960)|defunct 1960s far-right party]], the BNP was created by [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] and other former members of the fascist [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] (NF). During the 1980s and 1990s, the BNP placed little emphasis on contesting elections, in which it did poorly. Instead, it focused on street marches and rallies, creating the [[Combat 18]] paramilitary—its name a reference to [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]]—to protect its events from [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] protesters. A growing 'moderniser' faction was frustrated by Tyndall's leadership, and ousted him in 1999. The new leader [[Nick Griffin]] sought to broaden the BNP's electoral base by presenting a more moderate image, targeting concerns about rising immigration rates, and emphasising localised community campaigns. This resulted in increased electoral growth throughout the 2000s, to the extent that it became the most electorally successful far-right party in British history. Concerns regarding financial mismanagement resulted in Griffin being ousted in 2014. By this point the BNP's membership and vote share had declined dramatically, groups like [[Britain First]] had splintered off, and the [[English Defence League]] had supplanted it as the UK's foremost far-right group.

Ideologically positioned on the extreme or far-right of British politics, the BNP has been characterised as fascist or [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] by [[political science|political scientists]]. Under Tyndall's leadership, it was more specifically regarded as [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]]. The party is [[ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]], and it espouses the view that only [[white people]] should be citizens of the United Kingdom. It calls for an end to non-white migration into the UK and for non-white Britons to be stripped of citizenship and removed from the country. Initially, it called for the compulsory expulsion of non-whites, although since 1999 has advocated voluntary removals with financial incentives. It promotes [[scientific racism|biological racism]] and the [[white genocide conspiracy theory]], calling for global [[racial segregation|racial separatism]] and condemning [[Miscegenation|interracial relationships]]. Under Tyndall, the BNP emphasised [[Antisemitism|anti-semitism]] and [[Holocaust denial]], promoting the [[conspiracy theory]] that [[Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory|Jews seek to dominate the world]] through both [[communism]] and international [[capitalism]]. Under Griffin, the party's focus switched from anti-semitism towards [[Islamophobia]]. It promotes [[economic protectionism]], [[Euroscepticism]], and a transformation away from [[liberal democracy]], while its social policies oppose [[feminism]], [[LGBT rights]], and [[permissive society|societal permissiveness]].

The BNP has a highly centralised structure that gives its chairman near-total control. It established a range of sub-groups—such as a youth wing, record label, and trade union—and built links with extreme-right parties across Europe. Regarded as the most successful far-right party in British history, the BNP attracted most support from within [[White British]] working-class communities in northern and eastern England, particularly among middle-aged and elderly men. More widely, it was highly unpopular and faced much opposition from anti-fascists, religious organisations, and mainstream politicians and media. BNP members are banned from a number of professions, and polling suggested that a majority of Britons favoured a ban on the party.

===John Tyndall's leadership: 1982–1999===

The British National Party (BNP){{refn|The name British National Party had been used in politics by four organisations,{{sfn|Husbands|1983|p=19}} most notably by the [[British National Party (1942)|Mosleyite party]] which became the [[English National Association]] and by [[British National Party (1960s)|a 1960s party]] initiated by [[John Bean]], which became part of the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]]. Tyndall was a leading member of the 1960s BNP and a founder of the present party.|group=note}} was founded by the extreme-right political activist [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]]. Tyndall had been involved in [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] groups since the late 1950s before leading the far-right [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] (NF) throughout most of the 1970s. Following an argument with senior party member [[Martin Webster]], he resigned from the NF in 1980.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1pp=21–23|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=24}} In June 1980 Tyndall established a rival, the New National Front (NNF).{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=23}} At the recommendation of [[Ray Hill]]—who was secretly an [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] spy seeking to sow disharmony among Britain's far-right—Tyndall decided to unite an array of extreme-right groups as a single party.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1pp=24–25|2a1=Trilling|2y=2012|2p=59}} To this end, Tyndall established a Committee for Nationalist Unity (CNU) in January 1982.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=25}} In March 1982, the CNU held a conference at the [[Charing Cross Hotel]] in London,{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=25}} at which 50 far-right activists agreed to the formation of the BNP.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=25}}

The BNP was formally launched on 7 April 1982 at a press conference in [[Victoria, London|Victoria]].{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=26|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=36}} Led by Tyndall, most of its early members came from the NNF, although others were defectors from the NF, [[British Movement]], [[British Democratic Party]], and [[Constitutional Movement|Nationalist Party]].{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1pp=25–26|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=36}} Tyndall remarked that there was "scarcely any difference [between the BNP and NF] in ideology or policy save in the minutest detail",{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=37}} and most of the BNP's leading activists had formerly been senior NF figures.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=36}} Under Tyndall's leadership the party was neo-Nazi in orientation and engaged in nostalgia for [[Nazi Germany]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=37}} It adopted the NF's tactic of holding street marches and rallies, believing that these boosted morale and attracted new recruits.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=43}} Their first march took place in London on [[St. George's Day]] 1982.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=43}} These marches often involved clashes with anti-fascist protesters and resulted in multiple arrests, helping to cement the BNP's association with political violence and older [[fascism|fascist]] groups in the public eye.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=44}} As a result, BNP organisers began to favour indoor rallies, although street marches continued to be held throughout the mid-to-late 1980s.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=44}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=Through the streets now we are marching&lt;br&gt;Like an army as to war&lt;br&gt;For the cause of race and nation,&lt;br&gt;With our banners to the fore.&lt;br&gt;Into battle, into battle, into battle BNP!&lt;br&gt;Into battle BNP!|source=— BNP marching song, 1982{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=36}} }}

In its early years, the BNP's involvement in elections was "irregular and intermittent",{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=39}} and for its first two decades it faced consistent electoral failure.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=9}} It suffered from low finances and few personnel,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=41}} and its leadership was aware that its electoral viability was weakened by the anti-immigration rhetoric of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]].{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=49|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=42}} In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]] the BNP stood 54 candidates, although it only campaigned in five seats.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=9}} Although it was able to air its first [[party political broadcast]], it averaged a vote share of 0.06% in the seats it contested.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=31|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=41–42}}&lt;ref name="eightthree"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/roots/1979.stm |title= 1979–1983  |series=Under the skin of the BNP |accessdate=4 January 2010 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the [[Representation of the People Act 1985]] raised the electoral [[Deposit (politics)|deposit]] to £500, the BNP adopted a policy of "very limited involvement" in elections.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=42}} It abstained in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]],{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=41|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=9}} and stood only 13 candidates in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=9}} In [[Millwall by-election, 1993|a 1993 local by-election]] the BNP gained one council seat—won by [[Derek Beackon]] in the East London district of [[Millwall]]—after a campaign that played to local whites who were angry at the perceived preferential treatment received by Bangladeshi migrants in [[social housing]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gable|1y=1995|1p=263|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2pp=51, 62–65|3a1=Bottom|3a2=Copus|3y=2011|3p=144|4a1=Goodwin|4y=2011|4p=xii}} Following an anti-BNP campaign launched by local religious groups and the [[Anti-Nazi League]], it lost this seat during the [[United Kingdom local elections, 1994|1994 local elections]].{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=66|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2pp=xii, 47|3a1=Trilling|3y=2012|3pp=29–32}} In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], it contested 55 seats and gained an average 1.4% of the vote.{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=131|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=9}}&lt;ref name="copsey73"&gt;{{harvnb|Copsey|2004|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, the paramilitary group [[Combat 18]] (C18){{refn|The "18" in its name is derived from the initials of [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=1992 - 1993  |series=Under the skin of the BNP |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/roots/1992.stm |accessdate=26 June 2018 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A and H are the first and eighth letters of the [[Latin alphabet]].|group=note}} was formed to protect BNP events from anti-fascists.{{sfnm|1a1=Gable|1y=1995|1p=262|2a1=Sykes|2y=2005|2p=132|3a1=Copsey|3y=2008|3p=66|4a1=Driver|4y=2011|4p=136}} In 1992, C18 carried out attacks on left-wing targets like an [[anarchism|anarchist]] bookshop and the headquarters of the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]''.{{sfn|Sykes|2005|p=132}} Tyndall was angered by C18's growing influence on the BNP's street activities,{{sfn|Gable|1995|p=263}} and by August 1993, C18 activists were physically clashing with other BNP members.{{sfn|Gable|1995|p=264}} In December 1993, Tyndall issued a bulletin to BNP branches declaring C18 to be a proscribed organisation, furthermore suggesting that it may have been established by agents of the state to discredit the party.{{sfnm|1a1=Gable|1y=1995|1p=267|2a1=Sykes|2y=2005|2pp=135, 136|3a1=Copsey|3y=2008|3pp=67, 68}} To counter the group's influence among militant British nationalists, he secured the American white nationalist militant [[William Luther Pierce|William Pierce]] as a guest speaker at the BNP's annual rally in November 1995.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=69}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=John Tyndall was both [the BNPs] greatest asset and its greatest drawback. His persistence, rock-like reliability and leadership had kept the movement going, but with almost imperceptible growth since its 1982 foundation.|source=— Senior BNP member John Bean{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=75}} }}

In the early 1990s, a "moderniser" faction emerged within the party, favouring a more electorally palatable strategy and an emphasis on building grassroots support to win local elections.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=46}} They were impressed by the electoral gains made by a number of extreme-right parties in continental Europe—such as [[Jörg Haider]]'s [[Austrian Freedom Party]] and [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s [[National Front (France)|National Front]]—which had been achieved by both switching focus from [[biological racism]] to the perceived cultural incompatibility of different racial groups and by replacing anti-democratic platforms with [[populism|populist]] ones.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=70|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2pp=48–50}} 
The modernisers called for community campaigns among the white working-class populations of London's [[East End]],{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=46–47}} and Northern England.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=51}} While the modernisers gained some concessions from the party's hard-liners,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=51}} Tyndall opposed many of their ideas and sought to stem their growing influence.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=53}} In his view, "we should not be looking for ways of applying ideological cosmetic surgery to ourselves in order to make our features more appealing to the public".{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=45}}

===Nick Griffin's leadership: 1999–2014===

[[File:Nick griffin bnp from flickr user britishnationalism.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Nick Griffin at a BNP press conference in Manchester in 2009]]

After the BNP's poor performance at the 1997 general election, opposition to Tyndall's leadership grew.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=53}} The modernisers called the party's first leadership election, and in October 1999 Tyndall was ousted when two-thirds of those voting backed [[Nick Griffin]], who offered an improved administration, financial transparency, and greater support for local branches.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1pp=75–76, 101|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=55}} Often characterised as a political chameleon,{{sfn|Griffin|2011|p=201}} Griffin had once been considered a party hardliner before switching allegiance to the modernisers in the late 1990s. In his youth, he had been involved in the NF as well as [[Third Position]]ist groups like [[Political Soldier]] and the [[International Third Position]].{{sfnm|1a1=Griffin|1y=2011|1p=196|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=66}} Criticising his predecessors for fuelling the image of the BNP as "thugs, losers and troublemakers",{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=71}} Griffin inaugurated a period of change in the party.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=55–56}}

Influenced by Le Pen's National Front in France, Griffin sought to widen the BNP's appeal to individuals who were concerned about immigration but had not previously voted for the extreme-right.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=123|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=67}} The BNP replaced Tyndall's policy of compulsory deportation of non-whites to a voluntary system whereby non-whites would be given financial incentives to emigrate.{{sfnm|1a1=Driver|1y=2011|1p=142|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=68}} It downplayed [[biological racism]] and stressed the cultural incompatibility of different racial groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Driver|1y=2011|1p=142|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=68}} This emphasis on culture allowed it to foreground [[Islamophobia]], and following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 it launched a "Campaign Against Islam".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=68}} It stressed the claim that the BNP was "''not'' a racist party" but an "organised response to anti-white racism".{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=103}} At the same time Griffin sought to reassure the party's base that these reforms were based on pragmatism and not a change in principle.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=102|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=68}}

Griffin also sought to shed the BNP's image as a [[single-issue party]],{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=67}} by embracing a diverse array of social and economic issues.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=70}} Griffin renamed the party's monthly newspaper from ''British Nationalist'' to ''The Voice of Freedom'', and established a new journal, ''Identity''.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=114}} The party developed community-based campaigns,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=67}} through which it targeted local issues,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=70}} particularly in those areas with large numbers of skilled white working-class people who were disaffected with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=73}} For instance, in [[Burnley]] it campaigned for lower speed limits on housing estates and against the closure of a local swimming bath, while in South Birmingham it targeted pensioners' concerns about youth gangs.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=74}} In 2006 the party urged its activists to carry out local activities like cleaning up children's play areas and removing [[graffiti]] while wearing high-vis jackets emblazoned with the party logo.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1p=74|2a1=Trilling|2y=2012|2p=134}}

Griffin believed that [[Peak Oil]] and a growth in Third World migrants arriving in Britain would result in a BNP government coming to power by 2040.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=170}} 
The close of the twentieth century produced more favourable conditions for the extreme-right in Britain as a result of increased public concerns about immigration and established Muslim communities coupled with growing dissatisfaction with the established mainstream parties.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=9–10}} In turn, the BNP gained rapidly growing levels of support over the coming years.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=10}} In July 2000, it came second in the [[Bexley London Borough Council elections#1998-2002|council elections for the North End of the London Borough of Bexley]], its best result since 1993.{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=139|2a1=Trilling|2y=2012|2pp=95–96}} At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]] it gained 16% of the vote in one constituency and over 10% in two others.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=10}} In the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2002|2002 local elections]] the BNP gained four councillors, three of whom were in Burnley,{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=138|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2p=144|3a1=Goodwin|3y=2011|3p=11}} where it had capitalised on white anger surrounding the disproportionately high levels of funding being directed to the Asian-dominated Daneshouse ward.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=133–134}} This breakthrough generated public anxieties about the party, with a poll finding that six in ten supported a ban on it.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=142|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=11}} In the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2003|2003 local elections]] the BNP gained 13 additional councillors, including seven more in Burnley, having attained over 100,000 votes.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1pp=124, 145|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=11|3a1=Trilling|3y=2012|3p=118}} Concerned that much of their potential vote was going to the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP), in 2003 the BNP offered UKIP an electoral pact but was rebuffed.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=154}} Griffin then accused UKIP of being a Labour Party scheme to steal the BNP's votes.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=155}} They invested much in the campaign for the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (United Kingdom)|2004 European Parliament election]], at which they gained 800,000 votes but failed to secure a parliamentary seat.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=150|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2pp=12–13}} In the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2004|2004 local elections]], they secured four more seats, including three in [[Epping, Essex|Epping]].{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=154}}

For the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], the BNP expanded its number of candidates to 119 and targeted specific regions. Its average vote in the areas it contested rose to 4.3%.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=11}} It gained significantly more support in three seats, achieving 10% in [[Burnley (UK Parliament constituency)|Burnley]], 13% in [[Dewsbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Dewsbury]], and 17% in [[Barking (UK Parliament constituency)|Barking]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=11}} In the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2006|2006 local elections]] the party gained 220,000 votes, with 33 additional councillors, having averaged a vote share of 18% in the areas it contested.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=167|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=12}} In Barking and Dagenham, it saw 12 of its 13 candidates elected to the council.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=2}} At the [[London Assembly election, 2008|2008 London Assembly election]], the BNP gained 130,000 votes, reaching the 5% mark and thus gaining an Assembly seat.{{sfnm|1a1=Woodbridge|1y=2010|1p=44|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=12}} At the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 European Parliament election]], the party gained almost 1 million votes, with two of its candidates, Nick Griffin and [[Andrew Brons]], being elected as Members of the European Parliament for [[North West England (European Parliament constituency)|North West England]] and [[Yorkshire and the Humber (European Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire and the Humber]] respectively.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2011|1p=1|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=13|3a1=Trilling|3y=2012|3p=152}} That election also saw extreme-right parties winning seats for various other EU member-states.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=13}} This victory marked a major watershed for the party.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=13}} Amid [[Question Time British National Party controversy|significant public controversy]], Griffin was invited to appear on the [[BBC]] show ''[[Question Time]]'' in October 2009, the first time that the BNP had been invited to share a national television platform with mainstream panellists. Griffin's performance was however widely regarded as poor.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2011|1p=4|2a1=Copsey|2a2=Macklin|2y=2011|2pp=86–89|3a1=Goodwin|3y=2011|3p=13|4a1=Trilling|4y=2012|4pp=168–169}}

Despite its success, there was dissent in the party. In 2007 a group of senior members known as the "December rebels" challenged Griffin, calling for internal party democracy and financial transparency, but were expelled.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=93}} In 2008, a group of BNP activists in [[Bradford]] split to form the Democratic Nationalists.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=80}} In November 2008, the BNP membership list was posted to WikiLeaks, after appearing briefly on a weblog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7956824.stm |title='BNP membership' officer sacked |work=BBC News |access-date=23 March 2009 |date=21 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326060319/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7956824.stm |archivedate=26 March 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in October 2009, another list of BNP members was leaked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/20/bnp-membership-list-wikileaks |title=BNP membership list leaked |work=The Guardian |access-date=20 October 2009 |place=London |first=Robert |last=Booth |date=20 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130044736/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/oct/20/bnp-membership-list-wikileaks |archivedate=30 January 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddy Butler then led a challenge to Griffin's leadership, alleging financial corruption, but he had insufficient support.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=94}} The rebels who supported him split into two groups: one section remained as the internal Reform Group, the other left the BNP to form the [[British Freedom Party]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=94}}
By 2010, there was discontent among the party's grassroots, a result of the change to its white-only membership policy and rumours of financial corruption among its leadership.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=13–14}} Some defected to the National Front or left to form parties like [[Britain First]], the [[British Freedom Party]], the National People's Party and the [[Britannica Party]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2014|p=901}} [[Anti-fascism|Anti-fascist]] groups like [[Hope not Hate]] had campaigned extensively in Barking to stop the area's locals voting for the BNP.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=14}} At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], the BNP had hoped to make a breakthrough by gaining a seat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], although it failed to achieve this.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=2–3}} It nevertheless gained the fifth largest national vote share, with 1.9% of the vote, representing the most successful electoral performance for an extreme-right party in UK history.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1p=14|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2014|2p=887}} In the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2010|2010 local elections]], it lost all of its councillors in Barking and Dagenham.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2011|1p=3|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=3}} Nationally, the party's number of councillors dropped from over fifty to 28.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=3}} Griffin described the results as "disastrous".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=3}}

[[File:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|right|The BNP uses the iconography of the Union flag prominently on its published material.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=42}}]]

Many academic historians and political scientists have described the BNP as a [[far-right]] party,{{sfnm|1a1=Wood|1a2=Finlay|1y=2008|1p=707|2a1=Driver|2y=2011|2p= 132|3a1=Bottom|3a2=Copus|3y=2011|3p=146|4a1=Copsey|4y=2011|4p=1|5a1=Davey|5y=2011|5p=436|6a1=Messina|6y=2011|6p=165|7a1=Trilling|7y=2012|7p=5}} or as an [[extreme-right]] party.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=1|2a1=Woodbridge|2y=2010|2p=25|3a1=Copsey|3y=2011|3p=1|4a1=Goodwin|4y=2011|4p=xii}} As the political scientist [[Matthew Goodwin]] used it, the term referred to "a particular form of political ideology that is defined by two anti-constitutional and anti-democratic elements: first, right-wing extremists are ''extremist'' because they reject or undermine the values, procedures and institutions of the democratic constitutional state; and second they are ''right-wing'' because they reject the principle of fundamental human equality".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=6}}

The anti-fascist activist [[Gerry Gable]] referred to the BNP as a "Nazi organisation",{{sfn|Gable|1995|p=262}} while the [[Anti-Nazi League]] published leaflets describing the BNP as the "British Nazi Party".{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=61}} Copsey suggested that while the BNP under Tyndall could be described as "Neo-Nazi", it was not "crudely mimetic" of the original German Nazism.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=98}} Davey characterised the BNP as a "populist ethno-nationalist" party.{{sfn|Davey|2011|p=435}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=The [BNP's] smart modernized veneer... is superficial; the core of the Party remains ideologically fascist, and this was nowhere more apparent than in the BNP manifesto for the 2010 General Election, which returned to a clutch of traditional fascist themes including the bond of blood, homeland, the decadence of contemporary culture, a nostalgia for folk traditions and heritage, and an emphasis on stricter discipline in education and society. During the election campaign anti-Semitism, racism and neo-Nazi sympathies were identified on candidates' social network sites.|source=— Political theologian Andrew P. Davey, 2011{{sfn|Davey|2011|p=438}} }}

In his writings, Griffin acknowledged that much of his 'modernisation' was an attempt to hide the BNP's core ideology behind more electorally palatable policies.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|pp=39–40}} Like the National Front, the BNP's private discourse differed from its public one,{{sfn|Wood|Finlay|2008|pp=708–709}} with Griffin stating that "Of course we must teach the truth to the hardcore... [but] when it comes to influencing the public, forget about racial differences, genetics, Zionism, historical revisionism and so on... we must at all times present them with an image of moderate reasonableness".{{sfnm|1a1=Wood|1a2=Finlay|1y=2008|1p=708|2a1=Davey|2y=2011|2p=439}} The BNP has eschewed the labels "fascist" and "Nazi", claiming that it is neither. In its 1992 electoral manifesto, it insisted that "Fascism was Italian. Nazism was German. We are British. We will do things our own way; we will not copy foreigners".{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=76}} In 2009, Griffin that the term "fascism" was simply "a smear that comes from the far left"; he added that the term should be reserved for groups that engaged in "political violence" and desired a state that "should impose its will on people", claiming that it was the anti-fascist group [[Unite Against Fascism]]—and not the BNP—who were the real fascists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/andrew_marr_show/8146456.stm |title='Sink a couple of boats' |website=BBC News |date=12 July 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327052302/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/andrew_marr_show/8146456.stm |archivedate=27 March 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, many on Britain's extreme-right sought to avoid the term "British fascism" because of its electorally unpalatable connotations, utilising "British nationalism" in its place.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=76–77}}

After Griffin took control of the party, it made increasing use of [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] themes in order to emphasise its "British" credentials.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=70}} In its published material, the party made appeals to the idea of Britain and Britishness in a manner not dissimilar to mainstream political parties.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=41}} In this material it has also made prominent use of the [[Union flag]] and the colours red, white, and blue.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=42}} Roger Griffin noted that the terms "Britain" and "England" appear "confusingly interchangeable" in BNP literature,{{sfn|Griffin|2011|p=190}} while Copsey has pointed out that the BNP's form of British nationalism is "Anglo-centric".{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=163}} The party employed militaristic rhetoric under both Tyndall and Griffin's leadership; under the latter for example its published material spoke of a "war without uniforms" and a "war for our survival as a people".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=165}} Tyndall described the BNP as a revolutionary party,{{sfn|Copsey|2011|p=82}} calling it a "guerrilla army operating in occupied territory".{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=83}}

===Ethnic nationalism and biological racism===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=The British National Party exists to secure a future for the indigenous peoples of these islands in the North Atlantic which have been our homeland for a millennia.|source=— The BNP, 2005{{sfn|Wood|Finlay|2008|p=707}} }}

The BNP adheres to [[scientific racism|biological racist]] ideas,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=8}} displaying an obsession with the perceived differences of racial groups.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=48}} Both Tyndall and Griffin believed that there was a biologically distinct white-skinned "British race" which was one branch of a wider [[Nordic race]],{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=88, 163}} a view akin to those of earlier fascists like Hitler and [[Arnold Leese]].{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=88}}

The BNP adheres to an ideology of [[ethnic nationalism]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=7}} It promotes the idea that not all citizens of the United Kingdom belong to the British nation.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=7}} Instead, it claims that the nation only belongs to "the English, Scots, Irish and Welsh along with the limited numbers of peoples of European descent, who have arrived centuries or decades ago and who have fully integrated into our society".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=7}} This is a group that Griffin referred to as the "home people" or "the folk".{{sfn|Griffin|2011|p=191}} According to Tyndall, "The BNP is a racial nationalist party which believes in Britain for the British, that is to say racial separatism."{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=37}} Richard Edmonds in 1993 told ''[[The Guardian]]'''s [[Duncan Campbell (The Guardian)|Duncan Campbell]] that "we [the BNP] are 100% racist".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gabriel, John ''Whitewash: Radicalized Politics and the Media'', Routledge, 1998, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; The BNP does not regard UK citizens who are not ethnic white Europeans as "British", and party literature calls on supporters to avoid referring to such individuals as "Black Britons" or "Asian Britons", instead describing them as "racial foreigners".{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=49}}

[[File:Nick Griffin.jpg|left|thumb|200px|On taking over the party, Nick Griffin dropped its official espousal of the biological superiority of a Nordic race, instead emphasising the need for racial separatism to preserve global "ethno-pluralism"]]

Tyndall believed the white British and the broader Nordic race to be superior to other races,{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=88}} and under his leadership, the BNP promoted [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims in support of [[white supremacy]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=38}} Following Griffin's ascendency to power in the party, it officially repudiated racial supremacism and insisted that no racial group was superior or inferior to another.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=67}} Instead it foregrounded an "[[Ethnopluralism|ethno-pluralist]]" racial separatism, claiming that different racial groups had to be kept separate and distinct for their own preservation, maintaining that global ethno-cultural diversity was something to be protected.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=160|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=67}} This switch in focus owed much to the discourse of the French [[Nouvelle Droite]] movement which had emerged within France's extreme-right during the 1960s.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=160}}
At the same time the BNP switched focus from openly promoting biological racism to stressing what it perceived as the [[cultural racism|cultural incompatibility of racial groups]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=68}} It placed great focus on opposing what it referred to as "[[multiculturalism]]",{{sfn|Rhodes|2011|p=62}} characterising this as a form of "cultural genocide",{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=160}} and claiming that it promoted the interests of non-whites at the expense of the white British population.{{sfn|Rhodes|2011|p=64}} However, internal documents produced and circulated under Griffin's leadership demonstrated that—despite the shift in its public statements—it remained privately committed to biological racist ideas.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=49}}

The party emphasises what it sees as the need to protect the racial purity of the white British.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=8}} It condemns [[miscegenation]] and "race mixing", claiming that this is a threat to the British race.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1p=38|2a1=Richardson|2y=2011|2p=48}} Tyndall stated that he "felt deeply sorry for the child of a mixed marriage" but had "no sympathy whatsoever for the parents".{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=89–90}} Griffin similarly stated that mixed-race children were "the most tragic victims of enforced multi-racism", and that the party would not "accept miscegenation as moral or normal ... we never will".{{sfn|Sutton|Perry|2009|p=91}} In its 1983 election manifesto, the BNP stated that "family size is a private matter" but still called for white Britons who are "of intelligent, healthy and industrious stock" to have large families and thus raise the white British birth-rate.{{sfn|Durham|1995|p=283}} The encouragement of high birth rates among white British families continued under Griffin's leadership.{{sfn|Trilling|2012|p=85}}

Under Tyndall's leadership, the BNP promoted [[eugenics]], calling for the forced sterilisation of those with genetically transmittable disabilities.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=90|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=38}} In party literature, it talked of improving the British 'racial stock' by removing "inferior strains within the indigenous races of the British Isles".{{sfnm|1a1=Durham|1y=1998|1pp=131–132|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=38}} Tyndall argued that medical professionals should be responsible for determining who to sterilise, while a lowering of welfare benefits would discourage breeding among those he deemed to be genetic inferiors.{{sfn|Durham|1998|pp=131–132}} In his magazine ''Spearhead'', Tyndall also stated that "the gas chamber system" should be used to eliminate "sub-human elements", "perverts", and "asocials" from British society.{{sfn|Griffin|2011|p=190}}

===Anti-immigrationism and repatriation===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Immigration into Britain by non-Europeans... should be terminated forthwith, and we should organise a massive programme of repatriation and resettlement overseas of those peoples of non-European origin already resident in this country.|source=— The BNP's first policy on repatriation, 1982{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=32}} }}

Opposition to immigration has been central to the BNP's political platform.{{sfn|Davey|2011|p=440}} It has engaged in [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] campaigns which emphasise the idea that immigrants and ethnic minorities are both different from, and a threat to, the white British and white Irish populations.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=7, 39}} In its campaign material it presented non-whites both as a source of crime in the UK, and as a socio-economic threat to the white British population by taking jobs, housing, and welfare away from them.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=40}} It engaged in [[welfare chauvinism]], calling for white Britons to be prioritised by the UK's welfare state.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=40}} Party literature included such as claims as that the BNP was the only party which could "do anything effective about the swamping of Britain by the Third World" or "lead the native peoples of Britain in our version of the New Crusade that must be organised if Europe is not to sink under the Islamic yoke".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=164}}

Much of its published material made claims about a forthcoming [[race war]] and promoted the [[conspiracy theory]] about [[white genocide]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=39–40}} In a 2009 radio interview, Griffin referred to this as a "bloodless genocide".{{sfn|Rhodes|2011|p=64}} It presents the idea that white Britons are engaged in a battle against their own extinction as a racial group.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=158}} It reiterated a sense of urgency about the situation, claiming that both high immigration rates and high birth rates among ethnic minorities were a threat to the white British.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=161–162}} In 2010, it for instance was promoting the idea that at current levels, "indigenous Britons" would be a minority within the UK by 2060.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=157}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=The immigrant communities in Britain are... colonies filled with colonists. They are alien islands inside our towns and cities with their own laws and cultures. They will never integrate as they did not come here to integrate, but to re-create their own cultures in our country. The fact is that the only solution to Multi-Culturalism is not some asinine and bogus attempt to impose British cultural values on immigrants, but simply to commence repatriating them.|source=— Lee Barnes, senior BNP leader, 2005{{sfn|Wood|Finlay|2008|p=720}} }}

The BNP calls for the non-white population of Britain to either be reduced in size or removed from the country altogether.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=7}} Under Tyndall's leadership it promoted the compulsory removal of non-whites from the UK, stating that under a BNP government they would be "repatriated" to their countries of origin.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=39}} In the early 1990s it produced stickers with the slogan "Our Final Solution: Repatriation".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=39}} Tyndall understood this to be a two-stage process that would take ten to twenty years, with some non-whites initially leaving willingly and the others then being forcibly deported.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=89}} During the 1990s, party modernisers suggested that the BNP move away from a policy of compulsory repatriation and toward a voluntary system, whereby non-white persons would be offered financial incentives to leave the UK.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=47–48}} This idea, adopted from [[Powellism]], was deemed more electorally palatable.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=47–48}}

When Griffin took control of the party, the policy of voluntary repatriation was officially adopted, with the party suggesting that this could be financed through the use of the UK's pre-existing [[Department for International Development|foreign aid budget]].{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=136|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2p=104|3a1=Goodwin|3y=2011|3p=68}} It stated that any non-whites who refused to leave would be stripped of their British citizenship and categorised as "permanent guests", while continuing to be offered incentives to emigrate.{{sfn|Sykes|2005|p=136}} Griffin's BNP also stressed its support for an immediate halt to non-white immigration into Britain and for the deportation of any migrants illegally in the country.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=68}} Speaking on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[The Andrew Marr Show|Andrew Marr Show]]'' in 2009, Griffin declared that, unlike Tyndall, he "does not want all-white UK" because "nobody out there wants it or would pay for it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |title=BNP 'does not want all-white UK' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8146585.stm |work=BBC News |date=12 July 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711171456/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8146585.stm |archivedate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Semitism and Islamophobia===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=My experience as a campaigner against the multi-racial idea in Britain and in favour of our country's centuries-old tradition of racial homogeneity has brought home to me beyond any doubt the fact that Jews are to be found at the forefront of opposition to British racial self-preservation.|source=— Tyndall's belief that a Jewish conspiracy was behind multiracial Britain{{sfn|Tyndall|1988|pp=106–107}} }}

Under Tyndall's leadership, the BNP was openly [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=38–39}} From [[A. K. Chesterton]], Tyndall had inherited a belief that there was a global conspiracy of Jews bent on world domination, viewing the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' as genuine evidence for this.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=91}} He believed that Jews were responsible for both [[communism]] and international finance capitalism and that they were responsible for undermining the British Empire and the British race.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=91}} He believed that both democratic government and immigration into Europe were parts of the Jewish conspiracy to weaken other races.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=89}} In an early edition of ''Spearhead'' published in the 1960s, Tyndall had expressed the view that "if Britain were to become Jew-clean she would have no nigger neighbours to worry about... It is the Jews who are our misfortune: T-h-e J-e-w-s. Do you hear me? THE JEWS?"{{sfnm|1a1=Billig|1y=1978|1p=128|2a1=Richardson|2y=2011|2p=53}} Tyndall added [[Holocaust denial]] to the anti-Semitic beliefs inherited from Chesterton, believing that the [[Holocaust]] was a hoax created by the Jews to gain sympathy for themselves and thus aid their plot for world domination.{{sfnm|1a1=Gable|1y=1995|1p=267|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2p=92|3a1=Goodwin|3y=2011|3p=39}} Among those to endorse such anti-Semitic conspiracy theories was Griffin, who promoted them in his 1997 pamphlet, ''[[Who are the Mind Benders?]]''{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=53}} Griffin also engaged in Holocaust denial, publishing articles promoting such ideas in ''The Rune'', a magazine produced by the [[Croydon]] BNP. In 1998, these articles resulted in Griffin being convicted of [[Incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|inciting racial hatred]].{{sfnm|1a1=Griffin|1y=2011|1p=197|2a1=Macklin|2y=2011|2p=26|3a1=Richardson|3y=2011|3p=52|4a1=Trilling|4y=2012|4p=75}}

When Griffin took power, he sought to banish overt anti-Semitic discourse from the party.{{sfn|Macklin|2011|p=26}} He informed party members that "we can get away with criticising Zionists, but any criticism of Jews is likely to be legal and political suicide".{{sfn|Trilling|2012|p=85}} In 2006, he complained that the "obsession" that many BNP members had with "the Jews" was "insane and politically disastrous".{{sfn|Macklin|2011|p=25}} In 2004, the party selected a Jewish candidate, Pat Richardson, to stand for it during local council elections, something Tyndall lambasted as a "gimmick".{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=42}} References to Jews in BNP literature were often coded to hide the party's electorally unpalatable anti-Semitic ideas.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=53}} For instance, the term "[[Zionism|Zionists]]" was often used in party literature as a euphemism for "Jews".{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1p=39|2a1=Richardson|2y=2011|2p=53}} As noted by Macklin, Griffin still framed many of his arguments "within the parameters of recognizably anti-Semitic discourse".{{sfn|Macklin|2011|p=36}} The BNP's literature is replete with references to a conspiratorial group who have sought to suppress nationalist sentiment among the British population, who have encouraged immigration and mixed race relationships, and who are promoting the Islamification of the country.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=52}} This group is likely a reference to the Jews, an old fascist canard.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|pp=52–53}}

Under Griffin, the BNP's website linked to other web pages that explicitly portrayed immigration as part of a Jewish conspiracy,{{sfn|Richardson|2011|pp=53–54}} while it also sold books that promoted Holocaust denial.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|pp=54–55}} In 2004, secretly filmed footage was captured in which Griffin was seen claiming that "the Jews simply bought the West, in terms of press and so on, for their own political ends".{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=52}} Sectors of the extreme-right were highly critical of Griffin's softening on the subject of the Jews, claiming that he had "sold out" to the '[[Zionist Occupied Government]]'.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|p=118}} In 2006, John Blean, editor of ''Identity'', included an article in which he reassured BNP members that the party had not "sold out to the Jews" or "embraced Zionism" but that it remained "committed to fighting... subversive Jews".{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=94}}

Copsey noted that despite Griffin's reforms, a "culture of anti-Semitism" still pervaded the BNP.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=162}} In 2004, a London activist told reporters that "most of us hate Jews",{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=162}} while a Scottish BNP group was observed making [[Nazi salute]]s while shouting "Auschwitz".{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=162}} The party's [[Newcastle upon Tyne Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle upon Tyne Central]] candidate compared the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] to [[Disneyland]], while their [[Luton North (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton North]] candidate stated her refusal to buy from "the kikes that run [[Tesco]]".{{sfn|Richardson|2011|pp=50–51}} In 2009, a BNP councillor from [[Stoke-on-Trent]] resigned from the party, complaining that it still contained Holocaust deniers and Nazi sympathisers.{{sfn|Macklin|Virchow|2011|p=220}}

Griffin informed BNP members that rather than "bang on" about the Jews—which would be deemed extremist and prove electorally unpopular—their party should focus on criticising [[Islam]], an issue that would be more resonant among the British public.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=85}} After Griffin took over, the party increasingly embraced an Islamophobic stance, launching a "Campaign Against Islam" in September 2001.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=68}} In ''Islam: A Threat to Us All'', a leaflet distributed to London households in 2007, the BNP claimed that it would stand up to both Islamic extremism and "the threat that 'mainstream' Islam poses to our British culture".{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=41}} In contrast to the mainstream British view that the actions of militant [[Islamism|Islamists]]—such as those who perpetrated the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]]—are not representative of mainstream Islam, the BNP insists that they are.{{sfn|Wood|Finlay|2008|p=710}} In some of its literature it presents the view that every Muslim in Britain is a threat to the country.{{sfn|Wood|Finlay|2008|p=721}} Griffin referred to Islam as an "evil, wicked faith",{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=166}} and elsewhere publicly described it as a "cancer" that needed to be removed from Europe through "chemotherapy".{{sfn|Trilling|2012|p=143}}

The BNP has called for the prohibition of immigration from Muslim countries and for the banning of the [[burqa|burka]], [[halal]] meat, and the building of new [[mosques]] in the UK.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=69}} It also called for the immediate deportation of radical [[Islamism|Islamist]] preachers from the country.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=69}} In 2005 the party claimed that its primary issue of concern was the "growth of fundamentalist-militant Islam in the UK and its ever-increasing threat to Western civilization and our implicit values".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=69}} To broaden its anti-Islamic agenda, Griffin's BNP made overtures to the UK's Hindu, Sikh, and Jewish communities; Griffin's claim that Jews can make "good allies" in the fight against Islam caused controversy within the international far-right.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|pp=41–42}}

===Government===

Tyndall believed that liberal democracy was damaging to British society, claiming that liberalism was a "doctrine of decay and degeneration".{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=83}} Under Tyndall, the party sought to dismantle the UK's liberal democratic system of parliamentary governance, although was vague about what it sought to replace this system with.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=40}} In his 1988 work ''The Eleventh Hour'', Tyndall wrote of the need for "an utter rejection of liberalism and a dedication to the resurgence of authority".{{sfn|Griffin|2011|p=190}} Tyndall's BNP perceived itself as a revolutionary force that would bring about a [[Palingenetic ultranationalism|national rebirth]] in Britain, entailing a radical transformation of society.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=84}} It proposed a state in which the Prime Minister would have full executive powers, and would be elected directly by the population for an indefinite period of time.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=85}} This Prime Minister could be dismissed from office in a further election that could be called if Parliament produced a [[vote of no confidence]] in them.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=85}} It stated that rather than having political parties, candidates standing for election to the parliament would be independent.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=85–86}} During the period of Griffin's leadership, the party downplayed its anti-democratic themes and instead foregrounded [[populism|populist]] ones.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=69–70}} Its campaign material called for the devolution of greater powers to local communities, the reestablishment of [[county councils]], and the introduction of citizens' initiative referendums based on those used in Switzerland.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=70}}

[[File:RifleshootingatRWB.jpg|thumb|left|Air rifle training at the BNP's 2008 youth camp]]
The BNP has adopted a hard Eurosceptic platform from its foundation.{{sfn|Szczerbiak|Taggart|2008|p=102}}
Under Tyndall's leadership, the BNP had overt anti-Europeanist tendencies.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|p=107}} Throughout the 1980s and 1990s he maintained the party's opposition to the [[European Economic Community]].{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|p=108}} Antagonism toward what became the [[European Union]] was retained under Griffin's leadership, which called for the UK to leave the Union.{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=136|2a1=Woodbridge|2y=2011|2p=108}}
One of [[Vote Leave]]'s biggest donors during the [[Brexit]] referendum was former BNP member Gladys Bramall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waterson|first1=Jim|title=Former BNP Member Has Given £600,000 To Vote Leave|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/vote-leave-donor|accessdate=18 December 2016|work=BuzzFeed|date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Syal|first1=Rajeev|title=Vote Leave gets big donation from former BNP member on leaked list|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/vote-leave-gets-big-donation-from-gladys-bramall-former-bnp-member-leaked-list|accessdate=18 December 2016|work=The Guardian|date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the party has claimed that its anti-Establishment rhetoric "created the road" to Britain's [[Brexit|vote to leave]] the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edwards|first1=Phil|title=How the BNP Created the Road to Brexit|url=https://www.bnp.org.uk/news/national/how-bnp-created-road-brexit|accessdate=18 December 2016|work=British National Party|date=30 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220213741/https://www.bnp.org.uk/news/national/how-bnp-created-road-brexit#|archive-date=20 December 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyndall suggested replacing the EEC with a trading association among the "White Commonwealth", namely countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=95}} Tyndall held [[imperialism|imperialist]] views and was sympathetic to the re-establishment of the British Empire through the recolonization of parts of Africa.{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=116|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2p=96}} However, officially the BNP had no plans to re-establish the British Empire or secure dominion over non-white nations.{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=144|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2p=95}} In the 2000s, it called for an immediate military withdrawal from both the [[Iraq War]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2014)|Afghan War]].{{sfn|Trilling|2012|p=131}} It has advocated ending overseas aid to provide economic support within the UK and to finance the voluntary repatriation of legal immigrants.&lt;ref name="routledge"/&gt;

Under Tyndall, the BNP rejected both [[Welsh nationalism]] and [[Scottish nationalism]], claiming that they were bogus because they caused division among the wider 'British race'.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=88}} Tyndall also led the BNP in support of [[Ulster loyalism]], for instance by holding public demonstrations against the [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] party [[Sinn Féin]],{{sfn|Durham|2012|p=207}} and endorsing Ulster loyalist paramilitaries.{{sfn|Gable|1995|p=267}} Under Griffin, the BNP continued to support Ulster's membership of the United Kingdom, calling for the crushing of the [[Irish Republican Army]] and the scrapping of the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]].{{sfn|Durham|2012|p=207}} Griffin later expressed the view that "the only solution that could possibly be acceptable to loyalists and republicans alike" would be the reintegration of the Irish Republic into the United Kingdom, which would be reorganised along [[federalism|federal]] lines.{{sfn|Durham|2012|p=208}} However, while retaining the party's commitment to Ulster loyalism, under Griffin the importance of the issue was downplayed, something that was criticised by Tyndall loyalists.{{sfn|Durham|2012|p=208}}

===Economic policy===

Tyndall described his approach to the economy as "National Economics",{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=94}} expressing the view that "politics must lead, and not be led by, economic forces".{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=93}} His approach rejected [[economic liberalism]] because it did not serve "the national interest", although still saw advantages in a [[capitalism|capitalist]] system, looking favourably on individual enterprise.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=94–95}} He called on capitalist elements to be combined with [[socialism|socialist]] ones, with the government playing a role in planning the economy.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=95}} He promoted the idea of the UK becoming an [[autarky]] which was economically self-sufficient, with domestic production protected from foreign competition.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=95}} This attitude was heavily informed by the [[corporatism|corporatist]] system that had been introduced in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Fascist Italy.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=96}}

A number of senior members, including Griffin and [[John Bean]], had [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] leanings, having been influenced by [[Strasserism]] and [[National Bolshevism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gable|1y=1995|1p=267|2a1=Macklin|2y=2011|2p=27}} Under Griffin's leadership, the BNP promoted [[economic protectionism]] and [[anti-globalisation|opposed globalisation]].{{sfn|Rhodes|2011|p=63}} Its economic policies reflect a vague commitment to distributist economics, ethno-socialism, and [[Autarky|national autarky]].{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|p=229}} The BNP maintains a policy of [[protectionism]] and [[economic nationalism]], although in comparison with other far-right nationalist parties, the BNP focuses less on [[corporatism]].&lt;ref name="routledge"&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2002|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has called for British ownership of its own industries and resources and the "subordination of the power of the City to the power of the government".&lt;ref name="routledge"/&gt; It has promoted the regeneration of farming in the United Kingdom, with the object of achieving maximum [[self-sufficiency]] in food production.&lt;ref name="routledge"/&gt;  In 2002, the party criticised corporatism as a "mixture of big capitalism and state control", saying it favoured a "[[distributism|distributionist]] tradition established by home-grown thinkers" favouring small business.&lt;ref name="eatw"&gt;{{harvnb|Eatwell|2004|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When it comes to [[environmentalism]], the BNP refers to itself as the "real green party", claiming that the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] engages in "watermelon" politics by being green (environmentalist) on the outside but red (leftist) on the inside.{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|p=230}} Influenced by the [[Nouvelle Droite]], it framed its arguments regarding environmentalism in an anti-immigration manner, talking about the need for 'sustainability'.{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|p=230}} It engages in [[climate change denial]], with Griffin claiming that global warming is a hoax orchestrated by those trying to establish the [[New world order (politics)|New World Order]].{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|p=230}}

===Social issues===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=There is only one political party that Christians can support without betraying the Lord Jesus Christ. This Party is opposed to abortion and the teaching of homosexuality to children. This Party supports the institution of marriage and the traditional family... This Party is opposed to political correctness and the creeping Islamification of Britain.|source=— A 2010 BNP leaflet distributed to Christian leaders{{sfn|Davey|2011|p=442}} }}

The BNP [[Anti-feminism|is opposed]] to [[feminism]] and has pledged that—if in government—it would introduce financial incentives to encourage women to leave employment and become housewives.{{sfnm|1a1=Durham|1y=1995|1pp=284–285|2a1=Durham|2y=1998|2pp=150, 152|3a1=Copsey|3y=2008|3p=87|4a1=Macklin|4y=2011b|4p=229}} It would also seek to discourage children being born out of wedlock.{{sfn|Durham|1998|p=160}} It has stated that it would criminalise [[abortion]], except in cases where the child has been conceived as a result of rape, the mother's life is threatened, or the child will be disabled.{{sfnm|1a1=Durham|1y=1998|1pp=142–143|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2pp=90–91|3a1=Macklin|3y=2011b|3p=229}} There are nevertheless circumstances where it has altered this anti-abortion stance; an article in ''British Nationalist'' stated that a white woman bearing the child of a black man should "abort the pregnancy... for the good of society".{{sfn|Durham|1998|p=144}} More widely, the party censures inter-racial sex and accuses the British media of encouraging inter-racial relationships.{{sfn|Durham|1998|pp=161–164}}

Under Tyndall, the BNP called for the re-criminalisation of homosexual activity.{{sfnm|1a1=Durham|1y=1998|1p=156|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2p=90}} Following Griffin's takeover, it moderated its policy on [[homosexuality]],{{sfn|Sykes|2005|p=136}} although opposed the 2004 [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|introduction]] of [[civil partnership]]s for same-sex couples.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=70}} During his 2009 ''Question Time'' appearance, Griffin described the sight of two men kissing as "really creepy".{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=88}} The party has also condemned the availability of [[pornography]]; its 1992 manifesto stated that the BNP would give the "pedlars of this filth... the criminal status that they deserve".{{sfn|Durham|1998|p=160}} The BNP promoted the reintroduction of [[capital punishment]],{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=70}} and the sterilisation of some criminals.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=90}} It also called for the reintroduction of [[national service]] in the UK,{{sfn|Sykes|2005|p=137}} adding that on completion of this service adults would be permitted to keep their standard issue [[assault rifle]].{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=159}}

According to the academic Steven Woodbridge, the BNP had a "rather ambivalent attitude toward Christian belief and religious themes in general" during most of its history,{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=25}} but under Griffin's modernisation the party increasingly utilised Christian terminology and themes in its discourse.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|pp=25, 26}} Various members of the party presented themselves as "true Christians",{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=25}} and defenders of the faith, with key ideologues claiming that the religion has been "betrayed" and "sold out" by mainstream clergy and the British establishment.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=26}} British Christianity, the BNP claimed, was under threat from Islam, [[Marxism]], multiculturalism, and "[[political correctness]]".{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=26}} On analysing the BNP's use of Christianity, Davey argued that the party's emphasis was not on Christian faith itself, but on the inheritance of European Christian culture.{{sfn|Davey|2011|p=442}}

The BNP long considered the mainstream media to be one of its major impediments to electoral success.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=92}} Tyndall claimed that the media represents a "state above the state" which was committed to the "left-liberal" goals of [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], liberal democracy, and racial integration.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=92}} The party has claimed that the mainstream media has given disproportionate coverage to the achievements of ethnic minority sportsmen and to the victims of anti-black racism while ignoring white victims of racial prejudice and the BNP's activities.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=93}}  Both Tyndall and Griffin have claimed that the mainstream media is controlled by Jews, who use it for their own devices; the latter promoted this idea in his ''Who are the Mind Benders?''{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|pp=92–93}} Griffin has described the BBC as "a thoroughly unpleasant, ultra-leftist establishment".{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=89}} The BNP has stated that if it took power, it would end "the dictatorship of the media over free debate".{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=95}} It claims that it would introduce a law prohibiting the media from disseminating falsehoods about an individual or organisation for financial or political gain,{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=94}} and that it would ban the media from promoting racial integration.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=95}}
BNP policy pledges to protect [[freedom of speech]],{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=159}} as part of which it would repeal all laws banning racial or religious hate speech.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=159}} It would repeal the 1998 Human Rights Act and withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref name="bbcmanifesto"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/BNP_uk_manifesto.pdf |work=BBC News |title=BNP General Election Manifesto 2005 |accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==

===Finances===

In contrast to the UK's mainstream parties, the BNP received few donations from businesses, wealthy donors, or trade unions.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=90}} Instead it relied on finances produced by its membership.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=91}} Under Tyndall, the party operated on a shoestring budget with a lack of transparency; in 1992 it collected £5000 and in 1997 it collected £10,000.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=91}} It also tried raising money by selling extreme-right literature, and opened a bookshop in [[Welling]] in 1989, although this was closed in 1996 after being attacked by anti-fascists and proving too costly to run.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2011b|1p=129|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=91}} In 1992 the party formed a [[dining club]] of its wealthier supporters, which was renamed the Trafalgar Club in 2000.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=91}} By the 1997 general election it admitted that its expenses had "far out-stripped" its income, and it was appealing for donations to pay off loans it had taken out.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=91}}

Griffin placed greater emphasis on fundraising, and from 2001 through to 2008 the BNP's annual turnover increased almost fivefold.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=91–92}} Membership subscriptions grew from £35,000 to £166,000, while its donations raised from £38,000 to £660,000.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=91–92}} However, expenses also rose as the BNP spent more on its electoral campaigns, and the party reported a financial deficit in 2004 and again in 2005.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=92}} Between 2007 and 2009 the BNP accumulated debts of £500,000.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=95}}

===Membership===

[[File:Bnp press conference from flickr user britishnationalism.jpg|thumb|right|A BNP press conference in 2009, featuring Richard Barnbrook and Nick Griffin]]

For most of its history, the BNP had a whites-only membership policy.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=122}} In 2009, the state's [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] stated that this was a violation of the [[Race Relations Act 1976]] and called on the party to amend its constitution accordingly.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=122}} Responding to this, in early 2010 members voted to remove the racial restriction to membership, although it is unlikely that many non-whites joined.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=122}} 
At its creation, the BNP had approximately 1,200 members.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=123}} By the 1983 general election this had grown to approximately 2,500, although by 1987 had slumped to 1000, with no significant further growth until the 21st century.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=123}} After taking control Griffin began publishing the party's membership figures: 2,174 in 2001, 3,487 in 2002, 5,737 in 2003, and 7,916 in 2004. Membership dropped slightly to 6,281 in 2005, but had grown to 9,297 in 2007 and to 10,276 in spring 2010.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=124}} In 2011, it was noted that this meant that the BNP had experienced the most rapid growth since 2001 of any minor party in the UK.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=125}}

A party membership list dating from late 2007 was leaked onto the internet by a disgruntled activist, containing the names and addresses of 12,000 members.{{sfnm|1a1=Woodbridge|1y=2010|1p=25|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=124}}&lt;ref name="guardian-2008-11-18"&gt;{{cite news |title=BNP membership list leaked online |author=James Sturcke, Matthew Weaver and Ian Cobain |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/18/bnp-membership-list-leak |work=The Guardian |date=18 November 2008 |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included names, addresses and other personal details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9808105a-b6a5-11dd-89dd-0000779fd18c.html |title=Probe into officer on BNP list |date=20 November 2008 |work=Financial Times |accessdate=12 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; People on the list included prison officers (barred from BNP membership), teachers, soldiers, civil servants and members of the clergy.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=25}} The leaked list indicated that membership was concentrated in particular areas, namely the East Midlands, Essex, and Pennine Lancashire, but with particular clusters in [[Borough of Charnwood|Charnwood]], [[Borough of Pendle|Pendle]], and [[Amber Valley]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=126}} Many of these areas had long been targeted by extreme-right campaigns, dating back to the NF activity of the 1970s, suggesting that such longstanding activism may have had an effect on levels of BNP membership.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=126–127}} This information also revealed that membership was most likely in urban areas with low rates of educational attainment and large numbers of economically insecure people employed in manufacturing, with further correlations to nearby Muslim communities.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=127–128}} Following an investigation by Welsh police and the [[Information Commissioner's Office (UK)|Information Commissioner's Office]], two people were arrested in December 2008 for breach of the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]] concerning the leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/dec/05/bnp-leak-arrests |title=Two held over BNP membership leak |work=The Guardian  |date=5 December 2008 |first=Angela |last=Balakrishnan |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Single was subsequently found guilty and fined £200. The fine was criticised as an "absolute disgrace" by a BNP spokesman and a detective sergeant involved said he was "disappointed" with the outcome.&lt;ref name="manfined"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/8231475.stm |title=Ex-BNP man fined over names leak |accessdate=2 April 2013 |date=1 September 2009 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaked membership list showed that the party was 17.22% female.{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|p=228}} While women have occupied key positions within the BNP, men dominated at every level of the party.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1p=28|2a1=Macklin|2y=2011b|2p=228}} In 2009, over 80% of the party's Advisory Council was male and from 2002 to 2009, three-quarters of its councillors were male.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=128}} The average percentage of female candidates presented at local elections in 2001 was 6%, although this had risen to 16% by 2010.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=128}} Since 2006, the party had made a point of selecting female candidates, with Griffin stating that this was necessary to "soften" the party's image.{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|pp=227–228}} Goodwin suggested that membership fell into three camps: the "activist old guard" who had previously been involved in the NF during the 1970s, the "political wanderers" who had defected from other parties to the BNP, and the "new recruits" who had joined post-2001 and who had little or no political interest or experience beforehand.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=131–134}}

Having performed [[qualitative research]] among the BNP by interviewing various members, Goodwin noted that few of those he interviewed "conformed to the popular stereotypes of them being irrational and uninformed crude racists".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=187}} He noted that most strongly identified with the working class and claimed to have either been former Labour voters or from a Labour-voting family.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=128–129}} None of those interviewed claimed a family background in the ethnic nationalist movement.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=130}} Instead, he noted that members claimed that they joined the party as a result of a "profound sense of anxiety over immigration and rising ethno-cultural diversity" in Britain, along with its concomitant impact on "British culture and society".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=142}} He noted that among these members, the perceived cultural threat of immigrants and ethnic minorities was given greater prominence than the perceived economic threat that they posed to white Britons.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=142}} He noted that in his interviews with them, members often framed Islam in particular as a threat to British values and society, expressing the fear that British Muslims wanted to Islamicise the country and eventually impose ''[[sharia]]'' law on its population.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=143–144}}

Goodwin described the BNP's voters as being "socially distinct and concerned about a specific set of issues".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=15}} Under Griffin's leadership, the party targeted areas with high proportions of skilled white working-class voters, particularly those who were disenchanted with the Labour government.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=73}} It has attempted to appeal to disaffected Labour voters with slogans such as "We are the Labour Party your Grandfather Voted For".{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1p=2|2a1=Trilling|2y=2012|2p=142}} The BNP had little success in gaining support from women, the middle classes, and the more educated.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=180}}

Goodwin noted a "strong male bias" in the party's support base, with statistical polling revealing that between 2002 and 2006, seven out of ten BNP voters were male.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=101}} That same research also indicated that BNP voters were disproportionately middle-aged and elderly, with three quarters being aged over 35, and only 11% aged between 18 and 24.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=101}} This contrasted to the NF's support base during the 1970s, when 40% of its voters were aged between 18 and 24.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=101}} Goodwin suggested two possibilities for the BNP's failure to appeal to younger voters: one was the 'life cycle effect', that older people have obtained more during in their life and thus have more to lose, feeling both more threatened by change and more socially conservative in their views.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=102}} The other explanation was the 'generational effect', with younger Britons who have grown up since the onset of mass immigration having had greater social exposure to ethnic minorities and thus being more tolerant toward them. Conversely, many older voters came of age during the 1970s, under the impact of the anti-immigrant rhetoric promoted by Powellism, Thatcherism, and the NF, and thus have less tolerant attitudes.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=102, 104}}

Most BNP voters had no formal qualifications and the party's support was centred largely in areas with low educational attainment.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} According to the 2002–06 data, two-thirds of BNP voters had either no formal qualifications or had left education after their [[O-levels]]/[[GCSE]]s.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} Only one in ten BNP voters possessed an [[A-level]],{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} and an even smaller percentage had a university degree.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} Most of the BNP's voting base were from the financially insecure lower classes.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} Research conducted from 2002 to 2006 indicated that seven out of ten BNP voters were either skilled or unskilled workers or unemployed.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} A 2009 poll found that six out of ten BNP voters fitted this profile.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} Goodwin suggested that it was the skilled working classes rather than their unskilled or unemployed neighbours who were the main support base behind the BNP, because they owned some assets and thus felt that they had more to lose as a result of the economic threat posed by immigrants and ethnic minorities.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=104–105}}

Research indicated that BNP voters also held opinions that were distinct from the average British citizen. They were far more pessimistic about their economic prospects than average, with seven out of ten BNP voters expecting their economic prospects to decline in future, contrasted with four out of ten who held this view in the wider population.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=105}} In the 2002–06 period, 59% of BNP voters considered immigration to be the most important issue facing the UK, compared with only 16% of the wider population who agreed.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1pp=108, 100|2a1=Trilling|2y=2012|2p=142}} By 2009, 87% of BNP voters identified immigration and asylum as the most important issue, to 49% of the wider population.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=110}} BNP voters were also more likely to identify law and order, the EU, and Islamic extremism as the most important issues facing the UK than other voters, and less likely than average to rate the economy, NHS, pensions, and housing market as the most important.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=108, 110}}

BNP voters were also more likely than average to believe both that white Britons face unfair discrimination, and that Muslims, non-whites, and homosexuals had unfair advantages in British society.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=107}} 78% of BNP voters endorsed the belief that the Labour Party prioritised immigrants and ethnic minorities over white British people, to 44% of the wider population.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=107}} When asked questions about immigration and Muslims, BNP voters were found to be far more hostile to them than the average Briton, and also more willing than average to support outright racially discriminatory policies toward them.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=112}} Copsey believed that "popular racism"—namely against asylum seekers and Muslims—generated the BNP's "largest reservoir of support",{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=146}} and that in many Northern English towns the main factors behind BNP support were white resentment toward Asian communities, anger at Asian-on-white crime, and the perception that Asians received disproportionately high levels of public funding.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=146–147}}

Research also indicated that BNP voters were more mistrustful of the establishment than average citizens. In 2002–06, 92% of BNP voters described themselves as being dissatisfied with the government, to 62% of the wider population.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=113–114}} Over 80% of BNP voters were found to distrust their local Member of Parliament, council officials, and civil servants, and were also more likely than average to think that politicians were personally corrupt.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=114}} There was also a tendency for BNP voters to read tabloids like the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''[[Daily Express]]'', and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', all of which promote anti-immigration sentiment. Whether these voters gained such sentiment as a result of reading these tabloids or they read these tabloids because it endorsed their pre-existing views is unclear.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1pp=107–108|2a1=Trilling|2y=2012|2p=144}}

The early stronghold of the BNP was in London, where it established enclaves of support in the boroughs of Enfield, Hackney, Lewisham, Southwark, and Tower Hamlets, with smaller units in Bexley, Camden, Greenwich, Hillingdon, Lambeth, and Redbridge.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=82}} By the late 1990s, the party was increasingly retreating from its original East End heartland, finding that its electoral support had declined in the area.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=83}} Griffin expressed the view that it was too dangerous for BNP activists to campaign in the East End, suggesting that they would likely be attacked by opponents.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=83}} Instead the party shifted its focus to parts of [[Outer London]], in particular the boroughs of Barking, Bexley, Dagenham, Greenwich, and Havering.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=84}} After Griffin took power, the party focused on building support in the North of England, taking advantage of the anxieties generated by the ethnic riots that took place [[2001 Bradford riots|in Bradford]], Oldham, and Burnley in 2001.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=84}} In the period between 2002 and 2006, over 40% of the BNP's voters were in Northern England.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=105}}

The decline of the BNP as an electoral force around 2014 helped to open the way for the growth of another right-wing party, UKIP.{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|p=274}} In a study Goodwin produced with Robert Ford, the two political scientists noted that UKIP's support base mirrored the BNP's in that it had the same "very clear social profile": the "old, male, working class, white and less educated".{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|p=159}} One area where the two differed, they noted, was in the fact that BNP support had been highest among the middle-aged before tailing off among the over 55s, whereas UKIP retained strong support with those over 55. Ford and Goodwin suggested that this might be because more over 55s had "direct or indirect experiences" of the Second World War, in which Britain defeated the fascist powers, resulting in them being less inclined to support fascist parties than their younger counterparts.{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|p=158}} Despite these commonalities, UKIP proved far more successful at mobilising these social groups than did the BNP.{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|pp=175–176}} This was likely in part because UKIP had a "reputational shield"; it emerged from within the Eurosceptic tradition of British politics rather than from the far-right and thus, while often ridiculed by the mainstream, was regarded as a legitimate democratic actor in a way that the BNP was not.{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|pp=273–274}}

==Organisation and structure==

On its formation, the BNP avoided the National Front's committee-rule system of collective leadership in the hope of evading the infighting and factionalism that had damaged the NF.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=7}} Instead it was founded around what it called the "leadership principle", with a central chairman having complete control over the party, which was then arranged in a highly hierarchical structure.{{sfnm|1a1=Woodbridge|1y=2010|1p=30|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=77}} The BNP lacked any internal democracy, with the grassroots membership having no formal powers.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=77}} On taking power, Griffin retained the leadership principle inherited from Tyndall.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=78}} He nevertheless established an Advisory Council which would meet several times a year; the members were to be selected by Griffin himself and would serve as his advisors.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=108|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=79}}

The party's branches and local groups were referred to as "units" within the party.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=79}} These were designed to recruit followers, raise funds, and campaign during elections.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=79}} Under Tyndall, the party operated with a skeleton organisation.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=77}} It had no full-time staff and for most of the 1980s lacked a telephone number.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=78}} Instead it relied on a handful of geographically scattered, unpaid regional organisers.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=93}} Its early activists were recruited from within the extreme-right movement, and thus lacked the experience and skills in electoral campaigning.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=89}} When Griffin took control, he introduced a variety of internal departments to help manage the party's activities: the administration and enquiries department, department for group development, legal affairs department, security department, and communications department.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=79}} Griffin tried to build a more professional party machine by educating and training BNP members, providing them with incentives, establishing a steady income stream, and overcoming factionalism and dissent.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=88}} He launched an "annual college" for activists in 2001 and formed an education and training department in 2007.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=90}} In 2008 and 2010 he oversaw the establishment of "summer schools" for high-ranking officials.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=90}} The party also began employing full-time members of staff, having three in 2001 and 13 in 2007.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=93}}

To incentivise members to remain committed to the party, Griffin followed the example of the Swedish [[National Democrats (Sweden)|National Democrats]] by implementing a new "voting membership" scheme in 2007.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=171|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=90}} This meant that those who had been BNP members for two years could become a "voting member", at which they would go on a year's probation. During this year they were required to attend educational and training seminars, to engage in a certain amount of activism, and to donate a specified amount of money to the party.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=90}} Once completed, they were allowed to vote on certain matters at general members' meetings and annual conferences, to participate in policy debates, and to be eligible for intermediate and senior positions. This policy ensured that those who reached the higher echelons of the BNP were fully trained in the party's ideology and electoral strategy.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=90}}

===Sub-groups and propaganda output===
[[File:DutchArrow.JPG|thumb|right|Members of the Young BNP in 2008]]
Griffin hoped to build a wider [[social movement]] around the BNP by establishing affiliated networks and organisations.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=85}} In many cases, these were presented to the public in a way that concealed any direct connection to the BNP.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=40}} Most of these affiliated groups were poorly funded and had few members.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=87}} The party established its own [[record label]], Great White Records, a radio station, and a [[trade union]] known as [[Solidarity – The Union for British Workers]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=87}} It formed a group for young people known as the Young BNP, although in 2010 renamed this group as the BNP Crusaders, "to pay homage to our ancestors from the Middle Ages who saved Christian Europe from the onslaught of Islam".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=87}} It established a Land and People group to recruit support in rural areas, a Family Circle to recruit women and families, and both a Veterans Group and an Association of British ex-Servicemen for former military servicemen.{{sfnm|1a1=Woodbridge|1y=2010|1pp=40–41|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=87}} A group called Families Against Immigrant Racism was established to counter perceived racism against white Britons,{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=137|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2p=122|3a1=Goodwin|3y=2011|3p=87}} while an Ethnic Liaison Committee was created to build links with anti-Muslim [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Sikhism|Sikh]] groups active in Britain.{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=137|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2p=135|3a1=Woodbridge|3y=2010|3p=41|4a1=Goodwin|4y=2011|4p=87|5a1=Trilling|5y=2012|5p=116}} Another group was the [[American Friends of the British National Party]] (AFBNP), set up by [[Mark Cotterill]] in 1999 to gain support from sympathisers in the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=109|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2pp=87–88}} In 2001 it had 100 members, and by 2008 had 107.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=87–88}}

A group called Islands of the North Atlantic (IONA) was established to promote the BNP's view of British culture and identity.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=40}} The British Students Association was founded to promote the party's views among university students in 2000.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=40}}
Albion Life Insurance was set up in September 2006 as an insurance brokerage company established on behalf of the BNP to raise funds for its activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-151726902.html |title=BNP sets up life firm, ''Highbeam'' |publisher=HighBeam Research |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm ceased to operate in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/index.php?link=template&amp;story=185 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205192653/http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/index.php?link=template&amp;story=185 |archivedate=5 December 2006 |title=A finger in too many pies |date=November 2006 |work=Searchlight |publisher=Wayback Machine |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the BNP launched the [[Christian Council of Britain]] (CCB), a group designed to rival the [[Muslim Council of Britain]] and oppose the growing "Islamification" of inner city areas.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=41}} The CCB was established and run by BNP member [[Robert West (politician)|Robert West]], who claimed to have been ordained by the [[Apostolic Church (denomination)|Apostolic Church]], a claim that the church denies.{{sfnm|1a1=Woodbridge|1y=2010|1pp=42–43|2a1=Davey|2y=2011|2p=445}} West is a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and espouses a theology of nations which is influenced by Calvinist theologians like [[Abraham Kuyper]], holding that God wishes every race and nation to remain separate until [[end time]].{{sfn|Davey|2011|pp=445–446}}

Griffin's BNP also established an annual Red, White and Blue festival, which was based on the 'Blue Blanc Rouge' organised by France's National Front.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=109|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2pp=87, 88|3a1=Trilling|3y=2012|3p=97}} The festival brought party activists together and aimed to promote a more [[family friendly]] image for the group, although it also provided a venue for [[white power skinhead]] bands like Stigger, Nemesis and Warlord.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=87, 88}} Around 1,000 BNP members attended the party's 2001 festival.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=87}}

Under Griffin's leadership, the BNP zealously embraced the use of [[alternative media]] to promote itself in a way different from the negative portrayal that featured in the mainstream media.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=95}} On its website—which had been established in 1995{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=96}}—it created an internet television channel, 'BNPtv'.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=95}} It has created blogs that cover different themes without being explicitly political in order to promote the party's message.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=96}} The BNP established an online marketing platform, Excalibur, through which to sell its merchandise.{{sfn|Davey|2011|p=440}} In 2003, the BNP claimed that it had the most viewed website of a political party in Britain,{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=96}} and by 2011 was claiming to have the most viewed such website in Europe.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=96}} In September 2007, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper reported that [[Hitwise]], the online competitive intelligence service, said that the BNP website had more hits than any other website of a British political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BNP website is the most popular in politics |author=Christopher Hope |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1562960/BNP-website-is-the-most-popular-in-politics.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=13 September 2007 |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affiliations in the wider extreme-right===

Under Griffin, the BNP forged stronger links with various extreme-right parties elsewhere in Europe, among them France's National Front, Germany's [[National Democratic Party of Germany|National Democratic Party]] (NPD), Sweden's National Democrats, and Hungary's [[Jobbik]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=88}} Griffin unsuccessfully urged the NPD to move away from neo-Nazism and embark on the same 'modernisation' project that he had taken the BNP.{{sfn|Macklin|Virchow|2011|p=208}} [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] of the French [[Front National]] was the guest of honour at an "Anglo-French Patriotic Dinner" held by the BNP in April 2004.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=150–151}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3654941.stm |title=Le Pen UK visit sparks protests |work=BBC News |date=25 April 2004 |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Griffin met leaders of the Hungarian far right party [[Jobbik]] to discuss co-operation between the two parties and spoke at a Jobbik party rally in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= BNP's European ally Krisztina Morvai axed from London conference after protests |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/15/krisztina-morvai-london-conference-ban |newspaper=The Observer |date= 15 November 2009|author=Jamie Doward}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, [[Simon Darby]], deputy chairman of the BNP, was welcomed with fascist salutes by members of the Italian nationalist [[Forza Nuova]] during a trip to Milan.

[[Image:English Defence League protest in Newcastle.jpg|thumb|left|The English Defence League (demonstration pictured) was established by activists with BNP links, although the BNP has officially proscribed the group, accusing it of being manipulated by "Zionists".{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2011b|1p=138|2a1=Macklin|2y=2011b|2p=233}}]]

Britain's extreme-right has long faced internal and public divisions.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|p=104}} Disgruntled BNP members left the party to found or join a wide range of rivals, among them the [[British Freedom Party]], [[White Nationalist Party]], [[Nationalist Alliance]], [[Wolf's Hook White Brotherhood]], [[British People's Party (2005)|British People's Party]], [[England First Party]], [[Britain First]], [[Democratic Nationalists]], and the [[New Nationalist Party]].{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|p=104}} Various BNP members were involved in the nascent [[English Defence League]] (EDL)—with EDL leader [[Tommy Robinson (activist)|Tommy Robinson]] having been a former BNP activist—although Griffin proscribed the organisation and condemned it as having been manipulated by "Zionists".{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2011b|1p=138|2a1=Macklin|2y=2011b|2p=233|3a1=Trilling|3y=2012|3p=164}} The political scientist Chris Allen noted that the EDL shared much of the BNP's ideology, but that its "strategies and actions" were very different, with the EDL favouring street marches over electoral politics.{{sfn|Allen|2014|p=534}} By 2014, both the BNP and EDL were in decline, and Britain First—founded by former BNP members James Dowson and Paul Golding—had risen to prominence. It combined the electoral tactics of the BNP with the street marches of the EDL.{{sfn|Allen|2014|p=355}}

==Electoral performance==
{{Main|British National Party election results}}
The BNP has contested seats in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Research from Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin shows that BNP support is concentrated among older and less educated working-class men living in the declining industrial towns of the North and Midlands regions, in contrast to previous significant far-right parties like the National Front, which drew support from a younger demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ford |first1=Robert |last2=Goodwin |first2=Matthew J. |year=2010 |title=Angry White Men: Individual and Contextual Predictors of Support for the British National Party |journal=Political Studies |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=1–25 |publisher= |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.2009.00829.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9248.2009.00829.x/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General elections===
{{Main|British_National_Party_election_results#United_Kingdom_elections|l1=British National Party election results (United Kingdom elections)}}

The BNP placed comparatively little emphasis on elections to the British House of Commons, aware that the [[first past the post]] voting system was a major obstacle.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=170}}

The British National Party has contested general elections since 1983.

The BNP in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]] saved five deposits (out of 33 contested seats) and secured its best general election result in [[Oldham West and Royton]] (which had recently been the scene of racially motivated rioting between white and Asian youths) where party leader [[Nick Griffin]] secured 16% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/dec/12/politics.race1 |title=How the BNP turned racial hatred into votes |last=Ward |first=Lucy |work=The Guardian |date=12 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]] was considered a major breakthrough by the BNP, as they picked up 192,746 votes in the 119 constituencies it contested, took a 0.7% share of the overall vote, and retained a deposit in 40 of the seats.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/frontpage/4519347.stm |work=BBC News |title=BNP sees increase in total votes |date=6 May 2005 |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNP put forward candidates for 338 out of 650 seats for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecst.org.uk/docs/Elections%20Report%20-%20General%20Elections%202010_for%20web.pdf |title=Elections Report |publisher=Community Security Trust |date=6 May 2010 |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; gaining 563,743 votes&lt;ref name="BBC National Results"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/ |work=BBC News |title=National Results |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1.9%), finishing in fifth place and failing to win any seats. However, a record of 73 deposits were saved. Party chairman Griffin came third in the [[Barking (UK Parliament constituency)|Barking]] constituency, behind [[Margaret Hodge]] of Labour and Simon Marcus of the Conservatives, who were first and second respectively. At 14.6%, this was the BNP's best result in any of the seats it contested that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/a11.stm |title=Barking |work=BBC News |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local elections===
{{Main|British_National_Party_election_results#Local_elections|l1=British National Party election results (local elections)}}
The BNP's first electoral success came in 1993, when [[Derek Beackon]] was returned as a councillor in [[Millwall]], London. He lost his seat in elections the following year. The next BNP success in local elections was not until the [[Burnley Council election, 2002|2002]] local elections, when three BNP candidates gained seats on [[Burnley (borough)|Burnley]] council.&lt;ref name="parliament.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-05064.pdf |title=Electoral performance of the British National Party in the UK |date=15 May 2009 |work= |publisher=Parliament |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNP's first councillor for six years was John Haycock, elected as a parish councillor for [[Bromyard and Winslow]] in [[Herefordshire]] in 2000. Haycock failed to attend any council meetings for six months and was later disqualified from office.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=116–117}}

The party had 55 councillors for a time in 2009.&lt;ref name="parliament.uk"/&gt; After the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2013|2013 local county council elections]], the BNP was left with a total of two [[borough council]]lors in [[Local government in England|England]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Conal |last=Urquhart |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/04/bnp-members-breed-elections |title=BNP calls on members to breed more after elections disaster |work=The Guardian |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, the BNP had yet to make "a major breakthrough" on local councils.{{sfn|Bottom|Copus|2011|p=159}}
The BNP's councillors usually had "an extremely limited impact on local politics" because they were isolated as individuals or small groups on the council.{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|p=235}} Councillors from the main parties often disliked their BNP colleagues and deemed having to work alongside them as an affront to dignity and decency.{{sfn|Bottom|Copus|2011|p=152}}
Questions were often raised as to whether BNP councillors could adequately represent the interests of all of their local constituents.{{sfn|Bottom|Copus|2011|p=153}} On being elected, Beackon for instance stated that he refused to serve his Asian constituents in Millwall.{{sfn|Bottom|Copus|2011|p=154}} There were also allegations made that BNP councillors had particularly low attendance at council meetings, although research indicated that this was not the case, with the BNP's attendance record being largely average.{{sfn|Bottom|Copus|2011|p=148}}

There is evidence to suggest that racially and religiously motivated crime increased in those areas where BNP councillors had been elected.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=198|2a1=Macklin|2y=2011b|2p=235}} For instance, after the 1993 election of Beackon, there was a spike in racist attacks in the borough of Tower Hamlets.{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|pp=26–27}} BNP members were directly responsible for some of this; the party's national organiser [[Richard Edmonds]] was sentenced to three months imprisonment for his part in an attack on a black man and his white girlfriend.{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|pp=26–27}}

In the 2007 [[Welsh Assembly]] [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2007|elections]], the BNP fielded 20 candidates, four in each of the five regional lists, with [[Nick Griffin]] standing in the [[South Wales West (National Assembly for Wales electoral region)|South Wales West]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Immigration a key issue, says BNP |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6558981.stm |work=BBC News |date=16 April 2007 |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not win any seats, but was the only minor party to have saved deposits in the electoral regions, one in the North Wales region and the other in the South Wales West region. In total the BNP polled 42,197 votes (4.3%).

In the [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2011|2011 Welsh Assembly elections]], the BNP fielded 20 candidates, four in each of the five regional lists and for the first time 7 candidates were fielded in [[First-past-the-post voting|FPTP]] constituencies.

In the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election]], the party fielded 32 candidates, entitling it to public funding and an election broadcast, prompting criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uaf.org.uk/2007/08/no-to-public-funds-for-fascism/ |title=No to public funds for fascism |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNP received 24,616 votes (1.2%), no seats were won, nor were any deposits saved.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election]], the BNP fielded 32 candidates in the regional lists. 15,580 votes were polled (0.78%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/election2011/region/html/scotland.stm |title=Scotland elections |work=BBC News |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNP fielded 3 candidates for the first time in three constituencies each in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2011|2011 Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly elections]] ([[Belfast East (Assembly constituency)|Belfast East]], [[East Antrim (Assembly constituency)|East Antrim]] and [[South Antrim (Assembly constituency)|South Antrim]]). 1,252 votes were polled (0.2%), winning no seats for the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/election2011/constituency/html/northern_ireland.stm |title=Northern Ireland elections |work=BBC News |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Parliament===
{{Main|British_National_Party_election_results#European_Parliament||l1=British National Party election results (European Parliament)}}
The BNP has taken part in European Parliament elections since 1999, when they received 1.13% of the total vote (102,647 votes).

In the [[European Parliament Election, 2004 (UK)|2004 elections to the European Parliament]], the BNP won 4.9% of the vote, making it the sixth biggest party overall, but did not win any seats.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wheeler |first=Brian |title=Will BNP election gains last? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4968406.stm |accessdate=12 April 2013 |work=BBC News |date=5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNP won two seats in the European Parliament in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 elections]]. [[Andrew Brons]] was elected in the [[Yorkshire and the Humber (European Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire and the Humber]] regional constituency with 9.8% of the vote.&lt;ref name="BBC-BNP first seat"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8088133.stm |title=Labour slumps to historic defeat |work=BBC News |date=8 June 2009 |accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Party chairman [[Nick Griffin]] was elected in the [[North West England (European Parliament constituency)|North West region]], with 8% of the vote.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/elections/euro/09/html/ukregion_34.stm |title=European Election 2009: North West |date=8 June 2009 |work=BBC News |accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationally, the BNP received 6.26%.

The British Government announced in 2009 that the BNP's two MEPs would be denied some of the access and information afforded to other MEPs. The BNP would be subject to the "same general principles governing official impartiality" and they would receive "standard written briefings as appropriate from time to time", but diplomats would not be "proactive" in dealing with the BNP MEPs and that any requests for policy briefings from them would be treated differently and on a discretionary basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jul/09/diplomats-shun-nick-griffin-bnp-europe |title= UK diplomats shun BNP officials in Europe |accessdate=1 April 2013 |first=Ian |last=Traynor |date=9 July 2009 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with violence==
The leaders and senior officers of the BNP have criminal convictions for inciting racial hatred.{{sfn|Wood|Finlay|2008|p=708}}
John Hagan claims that the BNP has conducted [[Right-wing politics and violence|right-wing extremist violence]] to gain "institutionalized power".&lt;ref name="haganwilliam"&gt;{{harvnb|Heitmeyer|2003|p=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the BNP, such as [[Human Rights Watch]] in a 1997 report, have asserted that the party recruits from skinhead groups and that it promotes racist violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Human Rights Watch|1997|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, Nick Griffin has defended the threat of violence to further the party's aims. After the BNP won its first council seat in 1993, he wrote that the BNP should not be a "postmodernist rightist party" but "a strong, disciplined organisation with the ability to back up its slogan 'Defend Rights for Whites' with well-directed boots and fists.

A BBC ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme reported on a number of BNP members who have had criminal convictions, some racially motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Party Organisers: Criminal Record |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/membership/organisers/criminal.stm |series=Under the skin of the BNP |work=BBC News |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more notable convictions include:

==Reception==
[[File:Question time nick griffin protest 2.jpg|thumb|right|Protest against the BNP in 2009]]
In 2011, Goodwin described the BNP as being "the most successful party in the history of the extreme right in Britain".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=xiii}} That same year, John E. Richardson noted that it had achieved "a level of electoral success that is unparalleled in the history of British fascism".{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=41}} The historian Alan Sykes stated that "in electoral terms", the BNP achieved "more in the first three years of the twenty-first century" than the British far right "as a whole achieved in the previous seventy".{{sfn|Sykes|2005|p=151}} However, Copsey noted that the party's belief that one day the conditions would be right for it to win a general election belonged to the "Never-Never Land of British politics".{{sfn|Copsey|2011|p=2}} Copsey also noted that the BNP's electoral successes had been modest in comparison to those achieved by extreme-right groups elsewhere in Western Europe such as France's National Front, Italy's National Alliance, and Belgium's [[Vlaams Blok]].{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=191}}

The BNP's growth met a hostile reaction,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=xiii}} and in 2011 the political scientists Copsey and Macklin described it as "Britain's most disliked party".{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=95}} It was widely reviled as racist and even following Griffin's "modernisation" project it was still heavily tainted by its associations with neo-Nazism.{{sfn|Copsey|2011|p=6}} For many years it remained closely associated with the National Front in the British public imagination.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=28}}
The BNP remained unable to gain a broad appeal or widespread credibility.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=117}} In a 2004 poll, seven out of ten voters said that they would never consider voting for the BNP.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=117}} A 2009 poll found that two-thirds would "under no circumstances" consider voting BNP, while only 4% of respondents would "definitely consider" voting for them.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=117}}

The Conservative leader [[Michael Howard]] stated that the BNP were a "stain" on British democracy, adding that "this is not a political movement, this is a bunch of thugs dressed up as a political party".{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=151|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=xiii}} His successor [[David Cameron]] described it as a "completely unacceptable" organisation which "thrives on hatred".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=xiii}} The Labour prime minister, Tony Blair, called it a "nasty, extreme organisation",{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=xiii}} while the Liberal Democrat leader [[Nick Clegg]] termed it a "party of thugs and fascists".{{sfn|Copsey|2011|p=1}}  In 2004, the [[General Synod of the Church of England]] declared that supporting the BNP was incompatible with Christianity,{{sfn|Davey|2011|p=448}} comparing it to "spitting in the face of God".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=xiii}} Christian groups throughout Britain have maintained that the BNP's hostility toward cultural and ethnic diversity in the country was at odds with mainstream Christianity's emphasis on inclusiveness, tolerance, and interfaith dialogue.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|pp=46–47}}  [[Winston Churchill]]'s family has criticised the BNP's use of his image and quotations, labelling it "offensive and disgusting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BNP's Churchill use 'disgusting' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8068717.stm |work=BBC News |date=26 May 2009 |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singer [[Vera Lynn]] condemned the party for selling her CD on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dame Vera Lynn takes on BNP over White Cliffs of Dover |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/4687730/Dame-Vera-Lynn-takes-on-BNP-over-White-Cliffs-of-Dover.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Royal British Legion]] asked Griffin—at first privately and then publicly—to not wear their poppy symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Royal British Legion tell Nick Griffin to stop wearing poppy badge |author=Matthew Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/13/royal-british-legion-nick-griffin |work=The Guardian |date=13 June 2009 |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British police, [[Fire Brigades Union]], and [[Church of England]], prohibited its members from joining the BNP.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=138–139}}&lt;ref name="bettleysun"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3930175.stm |title=ACPO bans police from joining BNP |work=BBC News |date=27 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, [[Martin Narey]], banned BNP membership among prison workers; he subsequently received death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4247329.stm |title='No-one wanted' top UK jails post |date=8 February 2005 |accessdate=4 April 2013 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Education Secretary [[Michael Gove]] announced bans allowing headteachers to ban their staff from being party members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/mehdi-hasan/2010/11/bnp-teachers-gove-schools |title=In praise of Michael Gove: He's wrong on free schools but right to ban BNP teachers |last=Hasan |first=Medhi |work=New Statesman |date=2 November 2010 |accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/nov/02/bnp-members-barred-teaching |title=BNP members to be barred from teaching |work=The Guardian |date=2 November 2010 |last=Vasagar |first=Jeevan |accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Individuals whose membership of the party was made public sometimes faced ostracism and the loss of their job: examples include a school headmaster who had to resign, a caretaker who was sacked after attending a BNP rally, and a police officer dismissed from his position.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=138–139}} After BNP membership lists were leaked on the Internet, a number of police forces investigated officers whose names appeared on the lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/19/police-bnp-far-right-list |title=Police scour BNP membership to find officers breaching ban |work=The Guardian |first=Ian |last=Cobain |date=19 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, an invitation to Nick Griffin by the [[University of St Andrews]] Union Debating Society to participate in a debate on multiculturalism was withdrawn after protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=University's invitation to BNP leader withdrawn |author= |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/education/university-s-invitation-to-bnp-leader-withdrawn-1-674092 |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=5 February 2005 |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNP says that [[National Union of Journalists]] guidelines on reporting "far right" organisations forbid unionised journalists from reporting uncritically on the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bnp.org.uk/2008/03/the-media-reporting-on-the-bnp/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211165521/http://bnp.org.uk/2008/03/the-media-reporting-on-the-bnp/ |archivedate=11 December 2008 |title=The Media: Reporting on the BNP |author=Martin Wingfield |date=16 March 2008 |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnp.org.uk/news/national/traitors-%E2%80%93-3-denis-macshane |title=The Traitors – 3.

===Mainstream media and academia===

[[File:Anti BNP protestors and police outside BBC Television Centre.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters outside the BBC Television Centre, protesting against Griffin's invite to appear on ''Question Time'']]

Attitudes toward the BNP in both mainstream broadcast media and print journalism have been overwhelmingly negative,{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|pp=84–85}} and no mainstream newspaper has endorsed the party.{{sfn|Davey|2011|p=441}} This hostile coverage has even been found in right-wing tabloids like the ''Daily Mail'', ''Daily Express'' and ''The Sun'' which otherwise share the BNP's hostile attitude toward issues like immigration.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|pp=84–85}} In 2003, the ''Daily Mail'' described the BNP as "poisonous bigots", while in 2004 ''The Sun'' printed the headline of "BNP: Bloody Nasty People".{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1a2=Macklin|1y=2011|1p=85|2a1=Trilling|2y=2012|2p=123}} Senior BNP figures nevertheless believed that these tabloids' hostile coverage of immigration and Islam helped to legitimise and normalise the party and its views among much of the British public,{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=85}} a view echoed by some academic observers.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=99}} When, in 2004, anti-racist activists picketed outside the ''Daily Mail'' office in central London to protest against its negative coverage of asylum seekers, BNP members organised a counter-picket at which they displayed the placard "Vote BNP, Read the ''Daily Mail''".{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=98}}

The BNP initially faced a '[[No Platform|no platform for fascists]]' policy from the broadcast media, although this eroded as Griffin was invited on to a number of television programmes amid the party's growing electoral success.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=83}} When the BBC invited him to appear on ''Question Time'' in 2009 it was criticised by several trade unions, sections of the media, and several Labour politicians, all of whom believed that the BNP should not be given a public platform.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=87}} Anti-fascist protesters assembled outside of the television studio to protest Griffin's inclusion.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=88}}

The first academic attention to be directed at the BNP appeared after it gained a councillor in the 1993 local elections.{{sfn|Copsey|2011|p=6}} Nevertheless, throughout the 1990s it remained the subject of little academic research.{{sfn|Copsey|2011|p=6}} Academic interest increased following its victories at local elections from 2002 onward.{{sfn|Copsey|2011|p=6}} The first detailed monograph study to be devoted to the party was Nigel Copsey's ''Contemporary British Fascism'', first published in 2004.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=4}} In September 2008, an academic symposium on the BNP was held at [[Teesside University]].{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|p=227}}

===The wider extreme-right and anti-fascists===

Opposition to the BNP also came from the organised anti-fascist movement. By the mid-1990s, the BNP's attempts to stage public events in Scotland, the North West and the Midlands were largely thwarted by the militant disruption of the [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (AFA) group.{{sfn|Copsey|2011b|p=128}} The BNP's modernisation and move away from street demonstrations and toward electoral campaigning caused problems for the AFA, who proved unable to successfully change their tactics; on those occasions when AFA activists tried to forcibly disrupt BNP activities, they were prevented and arrested by [[riot police]].{{sfn|Copsey|2011b|pp=129–131}}

[[File:London MMB 09 University College.jpg|thumb|left|Activists belonging to the far-left [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] protesting against the BNP at [[University College London]] in 2009]]

More liberal sections of the anti-fascist movement sought to counter the BNP through community-based initiatives. ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]'' encouraged trade unions to establish localised campaigns that would ensure that ethnic minority and other anti-BNP locals voted. It suggested that such campaigns should avoid associating with the mainstream parties from which BNP voters felt disenfranchised and that they should not be afraid of calling out Islamic fundamentalists and extremists active in the area.{{sfn|Copsey|2011b|pp=131–133}} The [[Unite Against Fascism]] group also sought to maximise anti-BNP turnout at elections, calling on the electorate to vote for "anyone but fascists".{{sfn|Copsey|2011b|pp=134–135}} Evidence suggests that such anti-fascist activities did little to erode the far-right vote; this was in part because anti-fascist groups had encouraged the stereotype that BNP candidates were violent skinheads, something which conflicted with the more normal, friendly image that BNP activists cultivated when canvassing.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=140, 141}}

The BNP often received a hostile response from other sections of the British extreme-right.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|p=103}} Some extreme-right-wingers, such as the British Freedom Party, expressed frustration at the party's inability to moderate itself further on the issue of race, while those such as [[Colin Jordan]] and the NF accused the BNP—particularly under Griffin's leadership—of being too moderate.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|pp=103–104}} This latter view was articulated by an extreme-right [[groupuscule]], the International Third Position, when it claimed that the BNP "has been openly courting the Jewish vote and pumping out material which confirms what most us knew years ago: the BNP has become a multi-racist, Zionist, queer-tolerant anti-Muslim pressure group".{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|p=118}}

In ''[[ASLEF v. United Kingdom]]'', the [[European Court of Human Rights]] overturned an employment appeal tribunal ruling that awarded BNP member and train driver [[Jay Lee]] damages for expulsion from a trade union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-79604 |title=Case of Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers &amp; Firemen (ASLEF) v. the United Kingdom |date=27 February 2007 |publisher=European Court of Human Rights |accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Redfearn v United Kingdom]], the court ruled that members of racist organisations could lawfully be dismissed on health and safety grounds if there was a danger of violence occurring in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emplaw.co.uk/lawguide?startpage=2005irlr744.htm |title=Disclaw Publishing – Employment Law, unfair dismissal, redundancy pay |publisher=Emplaw.co.uk |accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] made a majority ruling (4 to 3) that in Redfearn's case against the UK government, his rights under Article 11 (free association) had been infringed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/nov/06/bus-driver-bnp-wins-rights-case |title=Bus driver sacked for BNP membership wins case in Strasbourg |date=6 November 2012 |publisher=The Guardian |first=Owen |last=Bowcott}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not those under Article 10 (free expression) or Article 14 (discrimination).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-114240 |title=CASE OF REDFEARN v.

The '''Christian Legal Centre (CLC)''' is a legal organization which was set up in December 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawcf.org/index.asp?page=Case+Wins+and+Launch+of+Christian+Legal+Centre |title=Case Wins and Launch of Christian Legal Centre |date=11 December 2007 |website=[[The Lawyers' Christian Fellowship]] |access-date=27 April 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525202605/http://www.lawcf.org/index.asp?page=Case+Wins+and+Launch+of+Christian+Legal+Centre |archive-date=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide legal support for [[Christian]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Lobbying|lobby]] on their behalf. They are linked to the [[Christian Concern]] campaigning organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/14239 |title=The Christian Legal Centre should apologise |last=Hill |first=Symon |date=1 March 2011 |website=[[Ekklesia (think tank)|Ekklesia]] |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cases==
Since its inception, the CLC has provided legal support in a number of high-profile cases in the UK. Most of them have been unsuccessful. Notable examples include:

* '''Emily Mapfuwa''', a Christian who launched a private prosecution against the [[Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art]] in [[Gateshead]] for exhibiting a statue by [[Terence Koh]] depicting [[Jesus]] with an erection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/03/religion.art |last=Pidd |first=Helen |date=3 September 2008 |title=Christian sues gallery over 'blasphemous' erection |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[BBC Essex]] radio interview, Michael Phillips (a solicitor working for CLC who is also a member of [[The Lawyers Christian Fellowship]]) admitted that Ms Mapfuwa had never actually visited the exhibition. In fact she lives over {{convert|250|mi|km}} away in [[Brentwood, Essex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://freethinker.co.uk/2008/09/26/jesus-penis-complainer-never-saw-the-exhibit/ |title=Jesus' penis complainer never saw the exhibit |last=McKeegan |first=Dave |date=26 September 2008 |journal=[[The Freethinker (journal)|The Freethinker]] |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianlegalcentre.com/mediacentre.php?avid=120&amp;avap=1 |title=Video &amp; Audio Media Centre: Michael Phillips on Offensive 'Jesus' Statue exhibition (BBC Radio Essex) |date=21 September 2008 |website=Christian Legal Centre |access-date=27 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226205921/http://www.christianlegalcentre.com/mediacentre.php?avid=120&amp;avap=1 |archive-date=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was eventually discontinued by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/7720587.stm |title='Indecent' Jesus action stopped |date=10 November 2008 |website=[[BBC News Online|BBC News]] |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Eunice and Owen Johns''', a Christian couple who applied to become [[foster parent]]s with [[Derby City Council]]. They withdrew their application after a social worker expressed concerns when they said they could not tell a child a homosexual lifestyle was acceptable. The two parties jointly agreed to take the case to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], for clarification of the law, but the court sided with the city council; stating that laws protecting people from discrimination, because of their sexual orientation, "should take precedence" over the right not to be discriminated against on religious grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-12598896 |title=Christian foster couple lose 'homosexuality views' case |date=28 February 2011 |website=BBC News |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/news/Defiant-Christian-foster-parents-vow-fight-ruling-court-homosexuality/article-3277205-detail/article.html |title=Defiant Christian foster parents vow to fight ruling by court on homosexuality |last=Hawley |first=Zena |date=1 March 2011 |newspaper=[[Derby Telegraph]] |access-date=27 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304175756/http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/news/Defiant-Christian-foster-parents-vow-fight-ruling-court-homosexuality/article-3277205-detail/article.html |archive-date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Hybrid embryo research:''' The CLC and Comment on Reproductive Ethics (CORE) were refused permission to apply for a [[judicial review]] to overturn the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]]'s decision to allow laboratory testing of [[hybrid embryo]]s. [[Linda Dobbs|Mrs Justice Dobbs]] at the High Court in London ruled that the application was "totally without merit", and ordered the CLC to pay costs amounting to some £20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7773112.stm |title='Hybrid embryo' legal block lost |date=9 December 2008 |website=BBC News |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[McFarlane v Relate Avon Ltd|Gary McFarlane]]''', a counsellor for [[Relate]] (a relationship support charity) who was sacked after raising a possible conscionable objection to assisting same-sex couples with sexual issues. The charity admitted to a charge of [[wrongful dismissal]], conceding that he should have been served notice instead of being fired immediately for '[[Misconduct|gross misconduct]]'. Further claims of [[unfair dismissal]] and [[Religious discrimination|discrimination on the grounds of religion]] were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edgeboston.com/index.php?ch=news&amp;sc=&amp;sc2=news&amp;sc3=&amp;id=99588 |title=U.K. Sex Counselor Refuses Gays, Loses 'Discrimination' Suit Over Lost Job |last=Melloy |first=Kilian |date=1 December 2009 |website=EDGE Boston |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His appeal against this ruling was dismissed by the High Court in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/8651417.stm |title=Christian sex therapist Gary McFarlane loses appeal bid |date=29 April 2010 |website=BBC News |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent appeal to the European Court of Human Rights also ended in failure.&lt;ref name="echr_ruling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-115881 |title=Case of Eweida and Others v. The United Kingdom |date=27 May 2013 |website=[[European Court of Human Rights]] |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Graham Cogman''', a police constable from [[Norfolk]] who was sacked for sending emails to colleagues in which he quoted Bible passages condemning homosexuality and forwarded details of a group that offered to "cure" homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/nov/26/3 |title=Officer sacked for homophobic emails |agency=[[Press Association]] |date=26 November 2008 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Shirley Chaplin''', a nurse who was supported by the CLC in an unsuccessful bid to sue the [[Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital|Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Trust]] for discrimination because it had moved her to a desk job after she refused to remove a [[cross necklace|crucifix on a chain]] when asked to do so on health and safety grounds (hospital dress code prohibits front-line staff from wearing any type of necklace in case patients try to grab them).&lt;ref name="chaplin_clc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianlegalcentre.com/view.php?id=1035 |title=Pray for Nurse Chaplin and her freedom to wear a cross |date=28 March 2010 |website=Christian Legal Centre |access-date=27 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231231438/http://www.christianlegalcentre.com/view.php?id=1035 |archive-date=31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital had offered Chaplin a compromise of wearing her cross pinned inside a lapel or pocket. An employment tribunal ruled they acted reasonably in April 2010, rejecting Chaplin's case.&lt;ref name="chaplin_fail"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/8605700.stm |title=Devon nurse loses crucifix 'ban' claim at tribunal |date=7 April 2010 |website=BBC News |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 28 March 2010, six current and former Anglican bishops; [[Lord Carey of Clifton]], [[Michael Scott-Joynt]], [[Michael Nazir-Ali]], [[Peter Forster]], [[Anthony Priddis]] and [[Nicholas Reade]] — cited the case in an open letter to the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' newspaper in which they claimed to be "deeply concerned at the apparent discrimination shown against Christians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/7528487/The-religious-rights-of-Christians-are-treated-with-disrespect.html |date=28 March 2010 |title=The religious rights of Christians are treated with disrespect |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ms Chaplin eventually tried unsuccessfully to obtain a ruling against the UK government at the European Court of Human Rights.&lt;ref name="echr_ruling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chaplin_fail" /&gt;

{{Pull quote|float=left|width=50%|''It would seem the Exeter Hospital would rather use its money to deny Christians their rights than using its scarce resources to treat patients.

* '''Duke Amachree''', a homelessness officer who was sacked by Wandsworth Council for subjecting a client to a "30-minute barrage" of evangelism when he was simply supposed to be offering her housing advice. The client complained to the Council, leading to an investigation. The Council complained that Amachree revealed "sensitive personal information" about the client to the media, namely an interview with ''The Daily Mail'' after the CLC had become involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/blog/jonathan_bartley/duke_amachree |title=Duke Amachree - Who is telling the truth? |last=Bartley |first=Jonathan |date=16 December 2009 |website=Ekklesia |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CLC supported Mr Amachree in an unsuccessful legal claim for unfair dismissal, religious discrimination and breach of contract. An appeal is{{when| date=April 2018}} being considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-10935390 |title=Christian Wandsworth Council worker loses sacking claim |date=11 August 2010 |website=BBC News |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Victoria Wasteney''', a senior [[occupational therapist]], head of forensic therapy at the John Howard Centre, a mental health unit of the [[East London NHS Foundation Trust]] who was suspended for "harassing and bullying" a junior Muslim colleague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/07/christian-nhs-worker-who-gave-religious-book-to-muslim-loses-app/ |title=Christian NHS worker who gave religious book to Muslim colleague loses appeal over ruling |date=7 April 2016 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre supported an appeal to the [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]], where Her Honour Judge Eady QC found that Wasteney's treatment was not because of her beliefs, but because of her inappropriate behaviour and that it had nothing to do with her freedom to manifest her religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/victoria.wasteney.victim.of.a.godless.legal.system/83600.htm |title=Victoria Wasteney: Victim of a godless legal system? |first=Mark |last=Woods |date=8 April 2016 |website=[[Christian Today]] |accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Jeff and Sue Green''', a couple who were accused of discriminating against same-sex couples by operating a ‘married couples only’ policy for their double rooms at their guesthouse in Wales. Following an anonymous complaint in 2013 that the guesthouse discriminated against gay couples, the UK [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC) warned the Greens that their website could be construed as “potentially discriminatory” and as such unlawful. The Greens changed their policy to offer only single beds in all rooms and the EHRC dropped the case. Supported by the CLC, in 2014 they sought a hearing at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) in Strasbourg because they feared that “recent UK equality legislation seems to be being used to undermine Christian faith and values”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/christian-couple-take-stance-gay-6865011 |title=Christian couple to take their stance on gay couples to the European Court of Human Rights |website=Wales on Line |access-date=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ECHR refused to consider their request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.christianconcern.com/sites/default/files/clc_case_summaries_v7.pdf |title=Case Summaries: 2006-2015 |last= |first= |date= |website=Christian Concern |publisher=CCFON Ltd. |access-date=3 May 2018 |quote=With the support of the Christian Legal Centre, the couple sought a hearing at the European Court of Human Rights.

The '''Communist League of Great Britain''' was an [[anti-revisionist]] group in the [[United Kingdom]].

It origins were in the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], where a faction formed around [[Bill Bland]].  Initially [[Maoist]], it joined the majority of the [[Committee to Defeat Revisionism, for Communist Unity]] in 1965 to form the [[Action Centre for Marxist-Leninist Unity]], publishing ''Hammer or Anvil''.&lt;ref name="moorhouse"&gt;John Moorhouse, ''A Historical Glossary of British Marxism'' (Pauper's Press, 1987) {{ISBN|0-946650-06-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1967, this was renamed the '''Marxist-Leninist Organisation of Britain'''.  Soon after, the group ceased supporting Mao, instead supporting [[Hoxhaism]] - although [[Hoxha]] was aligned with Mao at the time. Following a split the MLOB was renamed the ''Communist League'' in 1975, its ideological position strengthened with the [[Sino-Albanian Split]].

The group remained active into the new millennium, but became less so since Bland's death in 2001, and their website contains no new content since that year. The ''Communist Party Alliance'', a successor group working within the [[Stalin Society]], had their own site&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oneparty.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; which was active until 2009.

'''Compulsory arbitration''' is [[arbitration]] of [[labour (economics)|labor disputes]] which [[law]]s of some communities force the two sides, labor and [[management]], to undergo. These laws mostly apply when the possibility of a [[Strike action|strike]] seriously affects the [[public interest]]. Some labor [[contract]]s make specific provisions for compulsory arbitration should the two sides fail to reach agreement through the regular system of [[collective bargaining]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/SuperiorCourt/CivilDepartment/Arbitration/index.asp Arbitration Guide]. The Superior Court of Maricopa. Accessed March 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compulsory arbitration in Australia==
The [[Australia]]n [[Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904]] introduced the rule of law in industrial relations for Australia by establishing the [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]].

Since 1906 Australia has enforced a system of compulsory arbitration between employers and employees.  This statutory system of arbitration, the Industrial Relations Court or Commission, and the [[Harvester Judgment|Harvester]] court case underpin the Australian industrial relations system.

This system has been amended since 1983. The former [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] government, led by [[John Howard]], sought to further modify it through [[WorkChoices]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/432094/organized-labour/66938/Compulsory-arbitration-and-union-growth-in-Australasia Organized Labor in Australia]. Britannica Online. Accessed March 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The former Labor government, during the Rudd-Gillard era, sought to re-establish regulation surrounding compulsory arbitration of Australia's industrial relations regime through other means.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

{{Politics of Moldova}}

The '''Constitution of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic of 15 April 1978''' was the [[Constitution|fundamental law]] of the [[Moldovan SSR]], adopted in 1978.

==History== 
At its Extraordinary Session of 15 April 1978, the Supreme Soviet of the Moldavian Socialist Republic unanimously adopted a new republican Constitution, to replace the old [[Constitution of Moldova (1941)|Constitution of 12 January 1941]], including its subsequent amendments. The new Constitution consisted of a Preamble and 172 articles, and was prepared as part of the whole project of adjusting all 15 republican Constitutions to the new [[1977 Soviet Constitution|Constitution of the Soviet Union of October 1977]]. 

It was the second Constitution of the Moldavian SSR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/52-6-111.shtml "The New Constitution of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216093607/http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/52-6-111.shtml |date=16 February 2009 }}, ''[[Radio Free Europe]]'' background report&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 27 August 1994 the Constitution of the Moldavian SSR of 15 April 1978, including all its subsequent revisions and amendments, was abrogated in its entirety. On that same date the new [[Constitution of Moldova (1994)|Constitution of Moldova]] came into force.

The '''Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service''' ('''CSREES''') is an [[extension agency]] within the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), part of the executive branch of the federal government.  The 1994 Department Reorganization Act, passed by Congress, created CSREES by combining the former Cooperative State Research Service and the Extension Service into a single agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csrees.usda.gov/about/about.html About CSREES&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222175651/http://www.csrees.usda.gov/about/about.html |date=2008-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, CSREES was reorganized into the [[National Institute of Food and Agriculture]] (NIFA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csrees.usda.gov/newsroom/pdfs/NIFA%20Guidelines.pdf|title=NIFA Guidelines|author=|date=|website=usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sonny Ramaswamy]] serves as NIFA's director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nifa.usda.gov/office/office-director|title=Office of the Director {{!}} National Institute of Food and Agriculture|website=nifa.usda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
CSREES' mission is to "advance agriculture, the environment, human health and well-being, and communities" by supporting research, education, and extension programs at [[land-grant universities]] and other organizations it partners with.  CSREES doesn't conduct its own research; it provides funding and leadership to land-grant universities and competitively granted awards to researchers in partner organizations.
CSREES' areas of involvement span across 60 programs in the biological, physical, and social sciences related to agricultural research, economic analysis, statistics, extension, and higher education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csrees.usda.gov/about/background.html CSREES Overview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330071105/http://www.csrees.usda.gov/about/background.html |date=2008-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
CSREES administers federal appropriations through three funding tools: competitive grants, formula grants, and congressionally directed funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csrees.usda.gov/about/fed_asst.html|title=Federal Assistance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competitive Grants===
Competitive grants are awarded to applicants upon the recommendation of a peer-review panel.  CSREES' competitive programs include the [[National Research Initiative]], the Small Business Innovation Research Program, the Biotechnology Risk Assessment Program, and [[Outreach and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers]].

===Formula Grants===
CSREES supports research and extension activities at land-grant institutions through federal funds that are appropriated to states on the basis of statutory, population-based formulas.  CSREES' formula grants are directed to state experiment stations, the Cooperative Extension System, and Cooperative Forestry Programs.  In most cases, the states are required to match the federal formula dollars with nonfederal contributions.
The four CSREES research funding programs for land-grant universities are (1) Hatch, (2) Multistate Research (a subset of Hatch), (3) McIntire-Stennis, and (4) Animal Health.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070701080016/http://www.cuaes.cornell.edu/CUAESWeb/funding.htm Retrieved 2007-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congressional Directed Funding===
Congress directs CSREES to fund and administer certain programs each year through special appropriations accounts.  In general, the Executive Branch does not support the inclusion of these programs in the president's annual budget submission to Congress.  Examples of projects include: the Expert Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Decision Support System; Global Change, UV-B Monitoring; IPM and Biological Control; Minor Crop Pest Management, IR-4; and Minor Use Animal Drugs.

==Research==
CSREES is the USDA's extramural research agency, funding individuals; institutions; and public, private, and non-profit organizations.  Its research programs address issues affecting 13 national emphasis areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csrees.usda.gov/qlinks/research.html|title=Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Agriculture and Food Biosecurity
*Agricultural Systems
*Animals &amp; Animal Products
*Biotechnology &amp; Genomics
*Economics &amp; Commerce
*Education
*Families, Youth &amp; Communities
*Food, Nutrition &amp; Health
*International
*Natural Resources &amp; Environment
*Pest Management
*Plants &amp; Plant Products
*Technology &amp; Engineering

Supported research falls into three categories:

*Basic research: discovers the underlying processes and systems that make a plant, animal, ecosystem, community, or marketplace work.
*Applied research: expands on basic research to uncover practical ways this knowledge can benefit individuals and society.
*Integrated research: research is expected to generate new knowledge and/or apply existing knowledge quickly through dissemination of information on specific issues.

==Education==
Education programs support all CSREES emphasis areas and promote teaching excellence, enhance academic quality, and help develop the scientific and professional workforce.  CSREES continues a federal-state teaching partnership started in 1977 by strengthening agricultural and [[scientific literacy|science literacy]] in K-12 education, improving higher education curricula, and increasing the diversity and quality of future graduates to enter the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csrees.usda.gov/nea/education/education_all.html Overview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512000000/http://www.csrees.usda.gov/nea/education/education_all.html |date=May 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Agriculture in the classroom|Agriculture in the Classroom]] (AITC) was established to promote agricultural literacy in classrooms across the country. Today, AITC provides lesson plans, professional development opportunities, and teacher recognition programs for teachers, as well as maintains a national resource directory and other sources of public information on K-12 agricultural education issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Cooperative Extension System==
The Cooperative Extension System is a non-formal educational program implemented in the [[United States]] designed to help people use research-based knowledge to improve their lives. The service is provided by the state's designated [[land-grant university|land-grant universities]]. In most states, the educational offerings are in the areas of agriculture and food, home and family, environment, community economic development, and youth and [[4-H]]. The National 4-H Headquarters is located within the Families, 4-H, and Nutrition unit of CSREES.

The [[Smith-Lever Act of 1914|Smith-Lever Act]], which was passed in 1914, established the partnership between agricultural colleges and the USDA to support agricultural extension work. The act also stated that USDA provide each state with funds based on a population-related formula. Today, CSREES distributes these so-called formula grants annually in cooperation with [[U.S. state|state]] and [[counties of the United States|county]] governments and [[land-grant universities]].

Traditionally, each county of all 50 states had a local extension office. This number has declined as some county offices have consolidated into regional extension centers. Today, there are approximately 2,900 extension offices nationwide.

Since 2005, the Extension system has collaborated in developing eXtension.org (pronounced "e-extension"). eXtension is an Internet-based learning platform where Extension professionals and citizens nationwide and beyond have 24/7 access to unbiased, research-based, peer-reviewed information from land-grant universities on a wide range of topics. Information is organized into articles, professional development resources, news, frequently asked questions, and blog posts that provide a knowledge-to-action service that has become an integral part of the Cooperative Extension System. In 2015, the nonprofit, member-based eXtension Foundation was created to advance innovation and technology-enhanced professional development going forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csrees.usda.gov/qlinks/extension.html|title=Extension&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewExt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aplu.org/members/commissions/food-environment-and-renewable-resources/board-on-agriculture-assembly/cooperative-extension-section/ecop-members/new-extenstion.html |title=New eXtension |publisher=The Association of Public and Land-grant Universities |accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This table summarizes the cooperative extension programs in each state. (Under the 1890 amendment to the [[Morrill Act]], if a state's land-grant university was not open to all races, a separate land-grant university had to be established for each race.  Hence, some states have more than one land-grant university.)

{{Public Infrastructure}}

'''Critical infrastructure''' (or '''critical national infrastructure''' ('''CNI''') in the UK) is a term used by [[government]]s to describe [[assets]] that are essential for the functioning of a society and economy – the [[infrastructure]]. Most commonly associated with the term are facilities for:

* [[Shelter (building)|Shelter]]; [[Heating]] (e.g. [[natural gas]], [[fuel oil]], [[district heating]]);
* [[Agriculture]], food production and distribution;
* [[Water supply]] (drinking water, waste water/sewage, stemming of surface water (e.g. dikes and sluices));
* [[Public health]] (hospitals, ambulances);
* [[Transportation]] systems (fuel supply, railway network, airports, harbours, inland shipping);
* [[Security agency|Security services]] (police, military).
* [[Electricity generation]], transmission and distribution; (e.g. [[natural gas]], [[fuel oil]], [[coal]], [[nuclear power]])
** [[Renewable energy]], which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat.
* [[Telecommunication]]; coordination for successful operations
* [[Economic sector]]; [[Goods and services]] and [[financial services]] (banking, [[Clearing (finance)|clearing]]);

==Regional critical infrastructure protection programmes==

===European Union===
The European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection ([[European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection|EPCIP]]) has been laid out in EU Directives by the Commission (EU COM(2006) 786 final).

It has proposed a list of European critical infrastructures based upon inputs by its member states.

Each designated European Critical Infrastructures (ECI) will have to have an Operator Security Plan (OSP) covering the identification of important assets, a risk analysis based on major threat scenarios and the vulnerability of each asset, and the identification, selection and prioritisation of counter-measures and procedures.

===Germany===
The German critical-infrastructure protection programme is coordinated by the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]]. Some of its special agencies like the [[German Federal Office for Information Security]] or the Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance BBK deliver the respective content, e.g., about [[IT systems]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmi.bund.de/cae/servlet/contentblob/544770/publicationFile/27031/kritis.pdf ''Nationale Strategie zum Schutz Kritischer Infrastrukturen (KRITIS-Strategie)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{category see also|Emergency management in the United Kingdom}}
In the UK, the [[Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure]] (CPNI) provides information, personnel and physical security advice to the businesses and organisations which make up the UK's national infrastructure, helping to reduce its vulnerability to terrorism and other threats.

It can call on resources from other government departments and agencies, including [[MI5]], the [[Communications-Electronics Security Group]] and other government departments responsible for national infrastructure sectors.

===United States===
The USA has had a wide-reaching [[critical infrastructure protection]] program in place since 1996. Its [[Patriot Act]] of 2001 defined critical infrastructure as those "systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters."

In 2014 the [[NIST Cybersecurity Framework]] was published, and quickly became a popular set of guidelines, despite the significant costs of full compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/nist-cybersecurity-framework-adoption-hampered-by-costs-survey-finds/d/d-id/1324901|title=NIST Cybersecurity Framework Adoption Hampered By Costs, Survey Finds|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These have identified a number of critical infrastructures and responsible agencies:

# Agriculture and food – Departments of [[United States Department of Agriculture|Agriculture]] and [[Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services]]
# [[Water]] – [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]
# Public Health – Department of Health and Human Services
# Emergency Services – [[Department of Homeland Security]]
# Government – Department of Homeland Security
# [[Military–industrial complex|Defense Industrial Base]] – [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]
# [[Information]] and [[Telecommunications]] – [[Department of Commerce]]
# [[Energy]] – [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]
# [[Transport]]ation and [[Shipping]] – [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]]
# [[Banking]] and [[Finance]] – [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]]
# [[Chemical Industry]] and [[Hazardous Material]]s – Department of Homeland Security
# [[Mail|Post]]  – Department of Homeland Security
# [[National Monument (United States)|National Monuments]] and icons - [[Department of the Interior]]
# Critical manufacturing - Department of Homeland Security (14th sector announced 03-Mar-2008; recorded 30-Apr-2008)

====National Infrastructure Protection Plan====
The [[National Infrastructure Protection Plan]] (NIPP) defines critical infrastructure sector in the US. Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/presidential-policy-directive-critical-infrastructure-security-and-resil&lt;/ref&gt; issued in February, 2013 entitled Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience mandated an update to the NIPP. This revision of the plan established the following 16 critical infrastructure sectors:

# Chemical
# Commercial facilities
# Communications
# Critical manufacturing
# Dams
# Defense industrial base
# Emergency services
# Energy
# Financial services
# Food and agriculture
# Government facilities
# Healthcare and public health
# Information technology 
# Nuclear reactors, materials, and waste
# Transportation systems
# Water and wastewater systems

National Monuments and Icons along with the postal and shipping sector were removed in 2013 update to the NIPP. The 2013 version of the NIPP has faced criticism for lacking viable risk measures.&lt;ref&gt;White, R.

==Examples==
* General [[John J.

'''Dunglish''' ([[portmanteau]] of ''Dutch'' and ''English''; in Dutch '''''steenkolenengels''''', literally: "coal-English") is a popular term for mistakes native [[Dutch language|Dutch]] speakers make when trying to speak [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name=adebola&gt;[https://unravellingmag.com/articles/steenkolen-engels/ "Steenkolen Engels"], by Tope Adebola, February 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The term's usage is loosely connected to that of other English language [[Corruption (linguistics)|corruptions]], such as ''[[Engrish]]''.

English instruction in the Netherlands begins in elementary school or secondary school, and Dutch-speaking Belgians are usually taught English from the age of twelve. In addition, like all foreign-language films, English-spoken movies are subtitled rather than being dubbed in the [[Netherlands]] and in [[Flanders]], the Dutch-speaking part of [[Belgium]].

The Dutch word for the poorest form of Dunglish, ''steenkolenengels'' (''"Coal English"''), goes back to the early 20th century when Dutch port workers used a rudimentary form of English to communicate with the personnel of English coal ships.&lt;ref name=adebola/&gt;

Errors occur mainly in [[pronunciation]], [[word order]], and the meaning of words, so-called [[false friends]] and [[false cognates]]. Former Dutch ambassador and prime minister [[Dries van Agt]] supposedly once said "I can stand my little man" (translation of ''ik kan mijn mannetje staan'', a Dutch idiom meaning roughly "I can stand up for myself"). The former leader of the Dutch Liberal Party, [[Frits Bolkestein]], repeatedly referred to economic prospects as "[[Urolagnia|golden showers]]", unaware of the term's sexual connotation.&lt;ref name="undutchables"&gt;{{cite book | title =The Undutchables |author1=White, C. |author2=Boucke, L. | location =Amsterdam, Netherlands | publisher =Nijgh and Van Ditmar | year =2011 | isbn =9789038894324 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incorrect meaning of words ==

Errors often occur because of the ''[[false friend]]'' or [[false cognate]] possibility: words are incorrectly translated for understandable reasons. Examples are:
* Former prime minister [[Joop den Uyl]] once remarked that "''the Dutch are a nation of undertakers''". The Dutch verb ''ondernemen'' is literally the English ''to undertake'' (as ''onder'' is ''under'', and ''nemen'' is ''take''). The noun ''ondernemer'' is thus literally ''undertaker''; however the idiomatic English usage is instead the French loanword ''entrepreneur''.&lt;ref name="undutchables" /&gt; (Dutch uses the more specific ''begrafenisondernemer'' for a funeral director.)
* Former prime minister [[Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy]] had a meeting with [[Winston Churchill]] in London. Gerbrandy entered the room and shook Churchill's hand, saying: "Good-day!" Churchill responded: "This is the shortest meeting I have ever had". Gerbrandy had looked up the English translation of ''goedendag'', which in Dutch is often used as a formal [[Salutation|greeting]], yet "good day" is most often used  as [[valediction]] in Britain (as opposed to "good morning" or "good afternoon").
* The Dutch word "actueel" means "current" (whereas "actual" in English means "genuine"). A Dutch person unfamiliar with the English word might therefore be confused if he or she were asked about the "actual time" an appointment was supposed to start. 
* The Dutch verb ''solliciteren'' means to apply for a job, which can lead to an embarrassing situation if someone claims that they have come to solicit.
* The word ''eventueel'' in Dutch means ''potentially'' (like ''éventuel'' in [[French language|French]], ''eventuell'' in [[German language|German]], ''eventual'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''eventuale'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], ''eventual'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''eventuell'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]) and not ''eventually'', which is ''uiteindelijk'' in Dutch. This mistake caused a row between the Scottish and Belgian football associations when the Belgian football association invited delegates from various associations over for the "eventual qualification of the Belgian national football team" before the play-offs against Scotland started. While the Scottish federation accused the Belgians of sheer arrogance, the Belgian association had actually meant to hold the drink after a "possible qualification".&lt;ref name="undutchables" /&gt;

==Word order==
[[File:Meetingpoint caves.png|thumb|left|Two typical Dutch mistakes in English – wrong order for [[noun adjunct]]s ("meeting point caves" instead of "Meeting point for caves" or "Cave meeting point") and compound nouns written as one word ("meetingpoint")]]
Some Dutch speakers may use Dutch syntax inappropriately when using English, creating errors such as ''What mean you?'' instead of ''What do you mean?''

This is because English and Dutch do not follow exactly the same word order. English has a [[subject–verb–object]] word order, but this is shared only partially by Dutch, which has a [[V2 word order|verb-second]] order, causing the subject to follow the verb if another constituent already precedes it; e.g., ''Hij is daar'' ("He is there"), but ''Daar is hij''; literally "There is he" (idiomatically, "There he is"). 

Also, Dutch places [[perfect participle]]s towards the end of a clause while the [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] remains at the verb-second position, allowing for the two to be separated and for many other elements to stand in between; e.g. ''Ik '''heb''' dat gisteren [meteen na de lunch toen ik aankwam etc.] '''gedaan'''''; literally "I '''have''' that yesterday [immediately after the lunch when I arrived etc.] '''done'''".

In questions, English employs [[periphrastic]] constructions involving the verb ''to do'', a rare feature crosslinguistically. Dutch does not use this construction, but instead utilizes a [[verb–subject–object|VSO]] word order, inverting the subject and verb.

In English [[noun adjunct]]s, such as ''Schiphol'' in the phrase ''Schiphol Meeting Point'', the modifying noun comes before the other noun. In Dutch this is the reverse, giving rise to errors like "Meeting Point Schiphol".

==Compound nouns written as one word==
[[File:Compound noun error.jpg|thumb|Dutch compound noun error in English "boardingpass" instead of "boarding pass", as seen on [[KLM]] sign at [[Schiphol Airport]], 2013]]

In English, only certain compound nouns (such as "schoolteacher") can be written as one word, whereas in Dutch the default is to write compound nouns as a single word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Donaldson|title=Colloquial Dutch: A Complete Language Course|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_6oAawATeU4C&amp;pg=PA171|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-68299-5|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is witnessed in errors in English texts on signs &amp;ndash; at [[Schiphol Airport]] alone one can see signs for "meetingpoint", "boardingpass" and "traintickets". In some cases the English compound noun spelled as two words in English has been officially absorbed by the Dutch language &amp;ndash; as is the case with ''[[:nl:creditcard|creditcard]]'' (credit card) and ''jetlag'' (jet lag).

==Verb conjugation==

English and Dutch are both [[West Germanic languages]], with many [[cognate]] verbs with identical or nearly identical meanings. This similarity between verbs may cause speakers of Dutch to conjugate English verbs according to [[Dutch grammar]].
* ''We kisse(n) her.'' (Dutch ''kussen'' means and is cognate with English ''to kiss''. In Dutch grammar, verbs with plural subjects take a form identical to the infinitive, which in most cases has an ''en'' suffix.)
* ''What do you now?'' for ''What are you doing right now?'' (In Dutch, ''Wat doe je nu?'')
* ''How goes it now?'' for ''How are you doing now?'' (The phrase is used particularly after someone has had a bad spell. A similarly constructed phrase is found in Shakespeare, carrying a slightly different meaning, which underlines the even closer similarities between English and Dutch historically.)

== Errors in pronunciation ==

* Words like ''third'' and ''the'' are commonly mispronounced by Dutch speakers as ''turd'' and ''duh'', replacing the [[dental consonant|dental]] [[fricative consonant|fricative]] consonants that are not present in Dutch with dental [[plosive consonant|plosives]], the nearest equivalent.
* Many Dutch speakers have trouble distinguishing between ''bat'', ''bad'', ''bet'' and ''bed'' or between ''back'', ''bag'', ''beck'' and ''beg'' for that reason. This is because Dutch [[final-obstruent devoicing|devoices obstruents]] at the end of a word, and also because Dutch does not distinguish between {{IPA|[æ]}} and {{IPA|[ɛ]}}.
* Some pronounce the word ''idea'' (in Dutch: ''idee'') without the ending sound, making "Do you have an idea?" and "Do you have an ID?" sound the same.
* Most Dutch speakers mispronounce the english ''v'', being particularly evident when this is the starting letter of a word. For example, many Dutch would pronounce /ˈfɪdiəʊ/ for the word ''video'' instead of /ˈvɪdiəʊ/, or /fæn/ instead of /væn/ for the word ''van''.
== Other mistakes ==
* Using ''"greetings"'' to close a letter. Caused by the literal translation of ''"(met vriendelijke) groeten"'' (reinforced by the German ''"(mit freundlichen) Grüßen)"''. In English, a [[greeting]] typically refers to the beginning of any type of exchange.
* Using the [[possessive]] form without a [[possessive determiner|determiner]]. For example, ''"the Lamborghini of Patrick"'' instead of ''"Patrick's Lamborghini"'', or ''"the computer of her"'' instead of ''"her computer."''
* Excessive [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]]. ''"Officemanager"'' instead of ''"office manager."''
* Use of [[apostrophe]]s to indicate [[plural]] nouns. ''"Car's"'' instead of ''"cars."''

== Use in media ==
* A 2009 Dutch TV ad by the [[Eneco Energie|Eneco]] utility, promoting [[wind energy]], poked fun at the [[Dutch people]]'s tendency to speak Dunglish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EjyS6PP-Ro |title=Eneco commercial - 'From the wind, we can not live' |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2009-11-11 |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Dutch author Maarten H. Rijkens has written two books on the subject for Dutch readers: "I always get my sin" and "We always get our sin too".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Maarten H. Rijkens (Author) |url=https://www.amazon.com/I-Always-Get-My-Sin/dp/9045305615 |title=I always get my sin |publisher=Amazon.com |date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
[[Equatorial Guinea]] is a small nation of 1.2 million located on the west coast of [[Central Africa]] which gained independence from Spain in 1968. Thanks to the discovery and exploitation of significant [[oil reserves]] in the 1990s, it enjoys a [[purchasing power parity]] GDP per capita of more than US$38,699 which is as of 2016 the highest in Africa and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|31st highest]] in the world. However, the country has been ranked only [[List of countries by Human Development Index|138th out of 188 countries]] on the United Nations [[Human Development Index]] in 2015. After the oil price collapsed in 2014, the economy has gone into a free for all which has put growth in a downwards spiral from around 15% to -10%.

==Economy overview==
[[File:Equatorial Guinea Exports Treemap (2009).jpg|300px|thumb|Equatorial Guinea Exports Treemap (2009)]]
[[File:Rent Equatorial Guinea.png|thumb|300px|right|Comparison of GDP per capita of Equatorial Guinea and Spain, the former colonial power in the Area, basend on A. Maddieson ([http://www.ggdc.net/MADDISON/Historical_Statistics/horizontal-file_02-2010.xls World Population, GDP and Per Capita GDP, 1-2010 AD]).]]
Pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] production for hard currency earnings. In 1959 it had the highest [[per capita income]] of Africa which it still has.

The discovery of large [[oil reserves]] in 1996 and their subsequent exploitation have contributed to a dramatic increase in government revenue. As of 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1101-2004Sep6.html | work=The Washington Post | title=U.S. Oil Firms Entwined in Equatorial Guinea Deals | first=Justin | last=Blum | date=2004-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equatorial Guinea was the third-largest oil producer in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Its oil production had then risen to {{convert|360000|oilbbl/d}}, up from {{convert|220000|oilbbl/d}} only two years earlier.

Forestry, [[agriculture|farming]], and [[fishing]] are also major components of GDP. Subsistence farming predominates. Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the neglect of the rural economy under successive regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led growth. However, the government has stated its intention to reinvest some [[petroleum|oil]] revenue into agriculture. A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off since 1993 because of corruption and mismanagement. No longer eligible for concessional financing because of large oil revenues, the government has been unsuccessfully trying to agree on a "shadow" fiscal management program with the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]. Businesses, for the most part, are owned by government officials and their family members. Undeveloped natural resources include [[titanium]], [[iron ore]], [[manganese]], [[uranium]], and [[alluvium|alluvial]] [[gold]] ([[Mining industry of Equatorial Guinea|Mining in Equatorial Guinea]]). Growth remained strong in 2005 and 2006, led by oil.

==In greater depth==
Oil and gas exports have increased substantially (in 2003 [[Equatorial Guinea]] was ranked third among [[Africa|Sub-Sahara African]] producers behind [[Nigeria]] and [[Angola]]) and will drive the economy for years to come. The GDP increased by 105.2% in 1997, and real GDP growth reached 23% in 1999, and initial estimates suggested growth of about 15% in 2001, according to IMF 2001 forecast. Per capita income grew from about $1,000 in 1998 to about $2,000 in 2000. The energy export sector is responsible for this rapid growth. Oil production has increased from {{convert|81000|oilbbl/d}} to {{convert|210000|oilbbl/d}} between 1998 and early 2001. There is ongoing additional development of existing commercially viable oil and gas deposits as well as new exploration in other offshore concessions.

Equatorial Guinea has other largely unexploited human and natural resources, including a tropical climate, fertile soils, rich expanses of water, deepwater ports, and an untapped, if unskilled, source of labor. Following independence in 1968, the country suffered under a repressive dictatorship for 11 years, which devastated the economy. The agricultural sector, which historically was known for cocoa of the highest quality, has never fully recovered. In 1969 Equatorial Guinea produced 36,161 tons of highly bid cocoa, but production dropped to 4,800 tons in 2000. Coffee production also dropped sharply during this period to bounce back to 100,000 metric tons in 2000. Timber is the main source of foreign exchange after oil, accounting for about 12.4% of total export earnings in 1996-99. Timber production increased steadily during the 1990s; wood exports reached a record 789,000 cubic meters in 1999 as demand in Asia (mainly China) gathered pace after the 1998 economic crisis. Most of the production (mainly Okoume) goes to exports, and only 3% is processed locally. Environmentalists fear that exploitation at this level is unsustainable and point out to the permanent damage already inflicted on the forestry reserves on Bioko.

Consumer price inflation has declined from the 38.8% experienced in 1994 following the CFA franc devaluation, to 7.8% in 1998, and 1.0% in 1999, according to BEAC data. Consumer prices rose about 6% in 2000, according to initial estimates, and there was anecdotal evidence that price inflation was accelerating in 2001.

Equatorial Guinea's policies, as defined by law, comprise an open investment regime. Qualitative restrictions on imports, non-tariff protection, and many import licensing requirements were lifted when in 1992 the government adopted a public investment program endorsed by the World Bank. The Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea has sold some state enterprises. It is attempting to create a more favourable investment climate, and its investment code contains numerous incentives for job creation, training, promotion of non-traditional exports, support of development projects and indigenous capital participation, freedom for repatriation of profits, exemption from certain taxes and capital, and other benefits. Trade regulations have been further liberalized since implementation in 1994 of the ICN [[turnover tax]], in conformity with Central African tax and custom reform codes. The reform included elimination of quota restrictions and reductions in the range and amounts of tariffs. The CEMAC countries agreed to replace the ICN with a value added tax (VAT) in 1999.

While business laws promote a liberalized economy, the business climate remains difficult. Application of the laws remains selective. Corruption among officials is widespread, and many business deals are concluded under non-transparent circumstances.

There is little industry in the country, and the local market for industrial products is small. The government seeks to expand the role of free enterprise and to promote foreign investment but has had little success in creating an atmosphere conducive to investor interest.

The Equato-Guinean budget has grown enormously in the past 3 years as royalties and taxes on foreign company oil and gas production have provided new resources to a once poor government. The 2001 budget foresaw revenues of about 154 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] CFA francs (154 GCFAF) (about U.S.$200 million), up about 50% from 2000 levels. Oil revenues account for about two-thirds of government revenue, and VAT and trade taxes are the other large revenue sources.

Year 2001 government expenditures were planned to reach 158 billion CFA francs, up about 50% from 2000 levels. New investment projects represented about 40% of the budget, and personnel and internal and external debt payments represented about one-third of planned expenditures.

The Equato-Guinean Government has undertaken a number of reforms since 1991 to reduce its predominant role in the economy and promote private sector development. Its role is a diminishing one, although many government interactions with the private sector are at times capricious. Beginning in early 1997, the government initiated efforts to attract significant private sector involvement through a Corporate Council on Africa visit and numerous ministerial efforts. In 1998, the government privatized distribution of petroleum products. There are now Total and Mobil stations in the country. The government has expressed interest in privatizing the outmoded electricity utility. A French company operates cellular telephone service in cooperation with a state enterprise. The government is anxious for greater U.S. investment, and President Obiang visited the U.S. three times between 1999 and 2001 to encourage greater U.S. corporate interest. Investment in agriculture, fishing, livestock, and tourism are among sectors the government would like targeted.

Equatorial Guinea's balance-of-payments situation has improved substantially since the mid-1990s because of new oil and gas production and favorable world energy prices. Exports totaled about francs CFA 915 billion in 2000 (1.25 G$US), up from CFA 437 billion (700 M$US) in 1999. Crude oil exports accounted for more than 90% of export earnings in 2000. Timber exports, by contrast, represented only about 5% of export revenues in 2000. Additional oil production coming on line in 2001, combined with methanol gas exports from the new CMS-Nomeco plant, should increase export earnings substantially.

Imports into Equatorial Guinea also are growing very quickly. Imports totaled francs CFA 380 billion (530 M$US), up from franc CFA 261 million (420 M$US) in 1999. Imports of equipment used for the oil and gas sector accounted for about three-quarters of imports in 2000. Imports of capital equipment for public investment projects reached francs CFA 30 billion in 2000, up 40% from 1999 levels.

Equatorial Guinea's foreign debt stock was approximately francs CFA 69 billion (100 M$US) in 2000, slightly less than the debt stock in 1999, according to BEAC data. Equatorial Guinea's [[debt service ratio]] fell from 20% of GDP in 1994 to only 1% in 2000. Foreign exchange reserves were increasing slightly, although they were relatively low in terms of import coverage. According to the terms of the franc CFA zone, some of these reserves are kept in an account with the French Ministry of Finance.

Equatorial Guinea in the 1980s and 1990s received foreign assistance from numerous bilateral and multilateral donors, including European countries, the [[United States]], and the [[World Bank]]. Many of these aid programs have ceased altogether or have diminished. [[Spain]], [[France]], and the [[European Union]] continue to provide some project assistance, as do [[China]] and [[Cuba]]. The government also has discussed working with World Bank assistance to develop government administrative capacity.

Equatorial Guinea operated under an [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]-negotiated [[Enhanced structural adjustment facility|Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility]] (ESAF) until 1996. Since then, there have been no formal agreements or arrangements. The International monetary Fund held Article IV consultations (periodic country evaluations) in 1996, 1997, and in August 1999. After the 1999 consultations, IMF directors stressed the need for Equatorial Guinea to establish greater fiscal discipline, accountability, and more transparent management of public sector resources, especially energy sector revenue. IMF officials also have emphasized the need for economic data. In 1999, the Equato-Guinean Government began attempting to meet IMF-imposed requirements,  maintaining contact with IMF and the World Bank representatives. However, the newfound oil wealth allowed the government to avoid improving fiscal discipline, transparency and accountability.

== Infrastructure ==
Infrastructure is generally old and in poor condition. Surface transport is extremely limited at present, with little more than 700 kilometres of paved roads. The African Development Bank is helping to improve the paved roads from Malabo to Luba and Riaba; the Chinese are undertaking a project to link Mongomo to Bata on the mainland, and the European Union is financing an inter-states road network linking Equatorial Guinea to Cameroon and Gabon. Road maintenance is often inadequate.

Electricity is available in Equatorial Guinea's larger towns thanks to three small overworked hydropower facilities and a number of aged generators. In 1999, national production was about 13 MWh. In Malabo, the American company, CMS-Nomeco, built a 10 megawatt electricity plant financed by the government, which came in line in mid-2000, and plans to double capacity are advancing. This plant provides improved service to the capital, although there are still occasional outages. On the mainland the largest city, Bata, still has regular blackouts.

Water is only available in the major towns and is not always reliable because of poor maintenance and mismanagement. Some villages and rural areas are equipped with generators and water pumps, usually owned by private individuals.

Parastatal Getesa, a joint venture with a minority ownership stake held by a French subsidiary of [[Orange S.A.|Orange]], provides telephone service in the major cities. The regular system is overextended, but Orange has introduced a popular GSM system, which is generally reliable in Malabo and Bata.

Equatorial Guinea has two of the deepest Atlantic seaports of the region, including the main business and commercial port city of Bata. The ports of both Malabo and Bata are severely overextended and require extensive rehabilitation and reconditioning. The British company, Incat, has an ongoing project with the government to renovate and expand Luba, the country's third-largest port which is located on Bioko Island. The government hopes Luba will become a major transportation hub for offshore oil and gas companies operating in the Gulf of Guinea. Luba is located some 50 kilometres from Malabo and had been virtually inactive except for minor fishing activities and occasional use to ease congestion in Malabo. A new jetty is also being built at km 5 on the way from Malabo to the airport. It is a project mainly supposed to service the oil industry, but can also relieve the congested Malabo Port due to its closeness.
The Oil Jetty at km 5 was supposed to open the end of March 2003. Riaba is the other port of any scale on Bioko but is less active. The continental ports of Mbini and Cogo have deteriorated as well and are now used primarily for timber activities.

There are both air and sea connections between the two cities of Malabo and Bata. Most Soviet-built aircraft have been replaced mostly by ATR and Boeing operated by several small carriers, one state-owned, and the others private, constitute the national aircraft fleet. The runway at Malabo (3,200 m) is equipped with lights and can service aircraft similar to B777s and IL-76s. The one at Bata (2,400 m) does not operate at night but can accommodate aircraft as large as B737s. Their primary users are the national airline (EGA) and a private company (GEASA). Two minor airstrips (800 m) are located at Mongomo and Annobon. There are international connections out of Malabo to Madrid and Zurich in Europe and to Cotonou, Douala and Libreville in West Africa.

== Energy developments ==
{{main|Energy in Equatorial Guinea}}
After a slow start, Equatorial Guinea has recently{{when|date=August 2013}} emerged as a major oil producer in the Gulf of Guinea, one of the most promising [[hydrocarbon]] regions in the world. The main [[oil field]]s, Zafiro and Alba, both lie located offshore of Bioko island. In 1999 oil production was about five times its 1996 level; [[Zafiro Field]], operated by [[Exxon Mobil]] and [[Ocean Energy]], produced about {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d}}, and [[CMS Nomeco]] extracted approximately {{convert|6700|oilbbl/d}}. Aggressive field development and promising exploration activities may raise production to nearly {{convert|300000|oilbbl/d}} within 2 to 3 years (slightly above the current estimated production of Gabon) according to the official sources.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In 1995 Mobil (now Exxon Mobil) discovered the large Zafiro field,&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
with estimated reserves of {{convert|400000000|oilbbl}}. Production began in 1996. The company announced a 3-year U.S.$1bn rapid-development program to boost output to {{convert|130000|oilbbl/d}} by early 2001. Progress was delayed due to a contractual dispute with the government and by unexpectedly difficult geology. The difference with the government was eventually resolved.

In 1998 a more liberal regulatory and profit-sharing arrangement for [[hydrocarbon exploration]] and production activities was introduced. It revised and updated the production-sharing contract, which, until then, had favoured Western operators heavily. As a result, domestic oil receipts rose from 13% to 20% of oil export revenue. However, the government's share remains relatively poor by international standards.

In 1997 CMS Nomeco moved to expand its operation with a U.S.$300m methanol plant. The plant entered production in 2000 and helped boost [[natural gas condensate]] output from Alba field.

In August 1999 the government closed bidding on a new petroleum-licensing round for 53 unexplored deepwater blocks and seven shallow-water blocks. The response was small due to a combination of factors, including falling oil-prices, restructuring within the oil industry, and uncertainty over an undemarcated maritime border with Nigeria (which was not resolved until 2000).

In late 1999 [[Triton Energy]], a U.S. independent, discovered La Ceiba in block G in an entirely new area offshore the mainland of the country. Triton expects a U.S.$200m development program to enable La Ceiba and associated fields to produce {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d}} by late 2001, despite disappointments and technical problems at the beginning of the year.

With an upturn in oil prices, exploration intensified in 2000. In April 2000 U.S.-based Vanco Energy signed a production-sharing contract for the offshore block of Corisco Deep. In May 2000, [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] was granted block L, offshore [[Rio Muni]], and a further three production-sharing contracts (for blocks J, I, and H) were signed with [[Atlas Petroleum]], a [[Nigerian]] company.

In early 2001 the government announced plans to establish a national oil company, to allow Equatorial Guinea to take a greater stake in the sector and to facilitate the more rapid transfer of skills. However, critics{{who|date=August 2013}} fear that such a company may become a vehicle for opaque accounting and inertia of the sort that has hindered development in neighbouring countries including [[Angola]], [[Cameroon]], and [[Nigeria]].

Since 2001 the government has created [[GEPetrol]], a national oil company; and [[Sonagas]], a national natural-gas company.  The company [[EG LNG]] has been created to construct and operate the Bioko Island [[LNG]] plant and terminal. The plant began to operate in May 2007 and a second plant is now{{when|date=August 2013}} under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://lnglicensing.conocophillips.com/EN/news/documents/FirstLNGCargoFromEquatorialGuinea.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516013344/http://lnglicensing.conocophillips.com/EN/news/documents/FirstLNGCargoFromEquatorialGuinea.pdf |date=May 24, 2007 |archivedate=May 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |title=First LNG Cargo From Equatorial Guinea |publisher=Marathon Oil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equatorial Guinea became a member of [[OPEC]] in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/4305.htm |title=OPEC 172nd Meeting concludes |publisher=OPEC |date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal husbandry==
Cattle and poultry production is rapidly reaching its pre-independence levels of self-sufficiency with the financial help of the [[African Development Bank]]. However, production of domesticated animals is hindered by the presence of [[trypanosomiasis]] and other tropical deterrents. In 2005 there were 37,600 sheep, 9,000 goats, 6,100 hogs, and 5,000 cattle.

==Fishing==
The fishing industry gained strength through the 1980s and is now almost entirely modernized; a [[tuna]] processing plant went into operation in 1990. [[Annobón]] subsists almost entirely on fishing and retains its traditional preeminence in off shore [[whaling]] and turtle gathering. Bioko is also a major fishing center, the chief catches being [[Perch (disambiguation)|perch]], tuna, [[mackerel]], [[cod]], [[Esox|pike]], [[shark]], and [[crayfish]]. The country’s own catch was about 3,500 tons in 2003.

==Forestry==
Timber from Río Muni is Equatorial Guinea’s leading export. Forests cover over 62 percent of the land area. The Río Muni area on the mainland produces okoumé and akoga from rain forests of considerable age. Even though the government has given permission to foreign firms, exploitation is difficult due to infrastructural problems. The government enacted a new forestry action plan in 1990 in an effort to strengthen the sector’s development. In 2004, roundwood production was estimated at 811,000 cubic metres. In 2004, exports of forest products amounted to $97 million:

'''Ethel Maud Tawse Jollie''' (8 March 1874 – 21 September 1950; née '''Cookson'''; widowed '''Colquhoun''') was a writer and political activist in [[Southern Rhodesia]] who was the first female parliamentarian in the British overseas empire.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry, Donal (2004). [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/45519 "Colquhoun, Archibald Ross (1848–1914),"] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Cookson was born Ethel Maude Cookson in Castle Church, Stafford, the daughter of Samuel Cookson, a doctor. She studied art under [[Anthony Ludovici]] at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]] where she met her first husband, explorer [[Archibald Ross Colquhoun]]. They married at St. Paul′s church, Stafford, on 8 March 1900,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=marriages|day_of_week=Monday |date=12 March 1900 |page_number=1 |issue=36087| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and she accompanied her husband on tours across Asia, the Pacific and Africa, before settling in Southern Rhodesia. After Colquhoun's death on 18 December 1914, she replaced him as editor of ''United Empire'' magazine.{{sfn|Lowry|1997|p=262}} She later remarried a Rhodesian farmer called John Tawse Jollie.

Tawse Jollie was one of the front figures in the campaign for Rhodesian self-rule, founding the Responsible Government Association in 1917.{{sfn|Lowry|1997|p=261}} She was a leading member of the [[National Service League]], the [[Imperial Maritime League]], the [[British Women's Emigration Society]], the [[Women's Unionist Association]], and the [[Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council]]. Ethel Tawse Jollie was an avowed anti-suffragist and anti-feminist. She died in [[Harare|Salisbury]], Southern Rhodesia, on 21 September 1950.

'''Evander Smith''' was an openly gay [[San Francisco]] lawyer who gained national attention for his efforts to legally block San Francisco police from harassing attendees of a fund-raising ball organized by the [[Council on Religion and the Homosexual]], an early homophile organization, on January 1, 1965.&lt;ref name="miller_p348"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Neil|title=Out of the Past: Gay and Lesbian History from 1869 to the present|year=1995|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0679749888|pages=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police Harassment at California Hall==

On the eve of January 1, 1965, several homophile organizations in San Francisco, California - including the [[Council on Religion and the Homosexual]], the [[Society for Individual Rights]], the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], and the [[Mattachine Society]] - organized a fund-raising ball for their mutual benefit to be held at the [[California Hall]].&lt;ref name="miller_p348" /&gt;  Prior to the ball, several of the ministers from the Council on Religion and the Homosexual met with the San Francisco police, who tried to get them to cancel it.&lt;ref name="miller_p348" /&gt;  The clergy members declined to cancel the event, and the San Francisco police initially agreed not to interfere.&lt;ref name="miller_p348" /&gt; However, on the evening of the ball, the police showed up in force and surrounded the California Hall and focused numerous kleig lights on the entrance to the hall.  As each of the 600 plus persons entering the ball approached the entrance, the police took their photographs.&lt;ref name="miller_p348" /&gt;  A number of police paddy wagons were parked in plain view near the entrance to the ball.&lt;ref name="miller_p348" /&gt;

'''Evander Smith''', a lawyer for the groups organizing the ball, and '''[[Herb Donaldson (lawyer)|Herb Donaldson]]''', another openly gay lawyer, tried to stop the police from conducting the fourth "inspection" of the evening; both were arrested, along with two heterosexual lawyers - Elliott Leighton and Nancy May - who were supporting the rights of the participants to gather at the ball.&lt;ref name="miller_p348" /&gt;

On January 2, 1965, ministers associated with the '''Council on Religion and the Homosexual''' held a news conference in protest of Smith, Donaldson, and the other two lawyers arrest as well as the police harassment that they ball attendees had been subjected to.  Twenty-five of the most prominent lawyers in San Francisco joined the defense team for the four lawyers, and the judge directed the jury to find the four not-guilty before the defense had even had a chance to begin their argumentation when the case came to court.&lt;ref name="miller_p348" /&gt;

This event has been called the "San Francisco's [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]]" by some historians;&lt;ref name="miller_p348" /&gt;  The participation of such prominent litigators in the defense of the Smith, Donaldson, and the other two lawyers marked a turning point in gay rights on the West Coast of the United States.&lt;ref name="cain"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cain|first=Patricia A.|title=Litigating for Lesbian and Gay Rights: A Legal History|journal=Virginia Law Review|date=Oct 1993|volume=79|issue=7 Symposium on Sexual Orientation and the Law|pages=1551–1641|doi=10.2307/1073382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The '''[[Fascio|Fasci]] Siciliani''' {{IPA-it|ˈfaʃʃi sitʃiˈljani|}}, short for '''Fasci Siciliani dei Lavoratori''' (Sicilian Workers Leagues), were a popular movement of [[democracy|democratic]] and [[socialist]] inspiration, which arose in [[Sicily]] in the years between 1889 and 1894.&lt;ref&gt;''Fascio'' (plural: ''fasci'') literally means "[[fasces|faggot]]" (as in a bundle of sticks), but also "league", and was used in the late 19th century to refer to political groups of many different (and sometimes opposing) orientations.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fasci gained the support of the poorest and most exploited classes of the island by channeling their frustration and discontent into a coherent programme based on the establishment of new rights. Consisting of a jumble of traditionalist sentiment, religiosity, and socialist consciousness, the movement reached its apex in the summer of 1893, when new conditions were presented to the landowners and mine owners of Sicily concerning the renewal of sharecropping and rental contracts.

Upon the rejection of these conditions, there was an outburst of [[strike action|strikes]] that rapidly spread throughout the island, and was marked by violent social conflict, almost rising to the point of insurrection. The leaders of the movement were not able to keep the situation from getting out of control. The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene, and Prime Minister [[Francesco Crispi]] declared a state of emergency in January 1894, dissolving the organizations, arresting its leaders and restoring order through the use of extreme force. Some reforms followed, including [[workmen's compensation]] and [[pension scheme]]s. The suppression of the strikes also led to an increase in [[Italian migrants|emigration]].

==Characteristics==
The Fasci movement was made up of a federation of scores of associations that developed among farm workers, tenant farmers, and small [[sharecroppers]] as well as artisans, intellectuals, and industrial workers.&lt;ref name=cartosio&gt;Bruno Cartosio, ''Sicilian Radicals in Two Worlds'', in: Debouzy, ''In the Shadow of the Statue of Liberty'', pp. 120-21&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate demands of the movement were fair land rents, higher wages, lower local taxes and distribution of misappropriated common land.&lt;ref name=seton162&gt;Seton-Watson, ''Italy from liberalism to fascism'', pp. 162-63&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1889 and 1893 some 170 Fasci were established in Sicily. According to some sources the movement reached a membership of more than 300,000 by the end of 1893.&lt;ref name=cartosio/&gt; The Fasci constituted autonomous organizations with their own insignia (red rosettes), uniforms and sometimes even musical bands, and their own local halls for reunions and congresses.&lt;ref&gt;Colajanni, ''Gli avvenimenti di Sicila e le loro cause'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; They were called Fasci (''Fascio'' literally means bundle) because everyone can break a single stick, but no one can break a bundle of sticks.&lt;ref name=rep050209&gt;{{it icon}} [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2009/02/05/il-tribunale-militare-fu-un-abuso-di.html Il tribunale militare fu un abuso di Crispi], La Repubblica, 5 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

While many of the leaders were of socialist or [[anarchist]] leanings, few of their supporters were revolutionaries. Nevertheless, the peasants who assembled into the Fasci were eager for social justice and convinced that a new world was about to be born. A [[crucifix]] hung beside the [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] in many of their meeting-places, and portraits of the [[King Umberto I|King]] beside those of the revolutionaries [[Garibaldi]], [[Mazzini]] and [[Marx]]. Cheers for the King were often heard in their marches that almost resembled quasi-[[religious procession]]s.&lt;ref name=seton162/&gt; Many of the Fasci were part of the Italian Workers' Party (''[[Partito dei Lavoratori Italiani]]'', the initial name of the [[Italian Socialist Party]]) that had been founded at a conference in [[Genoa]] on August 14, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Colajanni, ''Gli avvenimenti di Sicila e le loro cause'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scolaro18&gt;Scolaro, ''Il movimento antimafia siciliano'', p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

The rural Fasci in particular were a curious phenomenon: both ancient and modern. They combined [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] aspirations with urban intellectual leadership often in contact with workers’ organizations and ideas in the more industrialized [[Northern Italy]].&lt;ref name=clark124&gt;Clark, ''Modern Italy, 1871 to the present'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=TFPJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124 pp. 124-25]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]], the Fasci were millenarian insofar as the socialism preached by the movement was seen by the Sicilian peasantry as a new religion, the true religion of Christ – betrayed by the priests, who were on the side of the rich – that foretold the dawn of a new world, without poverty, hunger and cold, in accordance with God’s will. The Fasci, which included many women, were encouraged by the messianic belief that the start of a new reign of justice was looming and the movement spread like an epidemic.&lt;ref name=hobsbawm98&gt;Hobsbawm, ''Primitive rebels'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=sCK8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA98 pp. 98-101]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fasci were the result of the revolt of the Sicilian peasants against the introduction of capitalist relationships into the rural economy aggravated by the [[Long Depression|world depression]] in agriculture of the 1880s.&lt;ref name=hobsbawm96&gt;Hobsbawm, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sCK8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA96 Primitive rebels]'', p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;  The agrarian crisis between 1888 and 1892 led to a steep decrease in wheat prices. The island’s main sources of wealth – wine, fruit and sulphur – suffered a heavy blow. The dominant landowning class channeled most of the economic burden on to the peasantry, in the form of higher rents and discriminatory local taxation. As social tension rose, a handful of young and hitherto quite unknown socialist intellectuals – many of them recent graduates of Palermo University – seized their opportunity. The movement grew under the first government of Prime minister [[Francesco Crispi]] (1887-1891) and coincided with unpopular tax increases and ratification of a series of laws curtailing personal freedom. The Italian economy had been sliding into a deep recession since the late 1880s. New protective tariffs had been introduced in 1887 on agricultural and industrial goods, followed by a trade war with France, which badly damaged Italian commerce and affecting Italy’s agricultural exports, the only potentially dynamic economic sector of southern Italy. Many farmers suffered severely.&lt;ref name=seton161&gt;Seton-Watson, ''Italy from liberalism to fascism'', p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=duggan339&gt;Duggan, ''The Force of Destiny'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=lSRwOZ0Yxw8C&amp;pg=PA340 p. 339]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bernardino Verro.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Bernardino Verro, one of the leaders of the Fasci]]
The first official ''Fascio'' was founded on May 1 ([[Labour Day]]), 1891, in [[Catania]] by [[Giuseppe de Felice Giuffrida]]. (An earlier ''Fascio'' was set up in [[Messina]] on March 18, 1889, but was dormant after its founder, [[Nicola Petrina]], was arrested in July of that year and not released until 1892. Another reason why the first ''Fascio'' of Messina – formed after the example of the ''[[Fasci operai]]'' [Workers leagues] constituted in Central and North Italy from 1871 – did not develop was that it brought together not individual workers but the workers' associations of the city, which retained their independence, their status and economic orientation.&lt;ref name=scolaro18/&gt;) Other leaders included [[Rosario Garibaldi Bosco]] in [[Palermo]], [[Nicola Barbato]] in [[Piana dei Greci]], [[Bernardino Verro]] in [[Corleone]], and [[Lorenzo Panepinto]] in [[Santo Stefano Quisquina]]. While the ruling elite depicted the men of the Fasci as treasonous socialists, communists and anarchists seeking to overthrow the monarchy; in fact many were devout [[Catholics]] and [[monarchists]]. The movement sometimes had a [[Messianism|messianic]] nature, characterised by statements such as "[[Jesus]] was a true socialist and wanted just what the Fasci were demanding." Nicola Barbato was known as "the workers' apostle."&lt;ref name=seton162/&gt;

The keenest socialist among the Fasci leaders was Garibaldi Bosco. In August 1892 he attended the Socialist party’s congress at Genoa and on his return obediently purged his fascio of its anarchist and other non-socialist members. His ideal of a united democratic front was shared by the father of Sicilian socialism, [[Napoleone Colajanni]]. The leader in Catania, De Felice, also maintained contact with leading anarchists like [[Amilcare Cipriani]]. On these and other important issues there was much friction between Catania and Palermo.&lt;ref name=seton161/&gt;

Crispi was replaced as prime minister by [[Antonio Di Rudinì]] in February 1891, who was succeeded by [[Giovanni Giolitti]] in May 1892. On January 20, 1893, when peasants of [[Caltavuturo]] occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs, local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 in the [[Caltavuturo massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20120314111511/http://www.cittanuove-corleone.it/La%20Sicilia%2C%20La%20strage%20di%20Caltavuturo%2008.02.2009.pdf L’eccidio di «San Sebastiano»], La Sicilia, February 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Disturbances continued throughout the year. The Fasci started out as urban movements, animated by artisans, which evolved into a more popular and combative mass movement with the adherence of sulphur miners, and in a later stage with the involvement of peasants and sharecroppers. In the autumn of 1893, labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers. The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes, involving the lowest tiers of the city and the countryside, becoming difficult, if not impossible, to control by its leaders.

==Initial success==
From its initial origins in [[Eastern Sicily]], especially in Catania, the movement got its real impetus with the establishment of the ''Fascio'' of Palermo on June 29, 1892. The Leagues rapidly radiated over all Sicily.&lt;ref name=scolaro18/&gt; In the spring of 1893 the leaders of the movement decided to carry their propaganda to the peasants and miners of the countryside. Between March and October the number of fasci grew from 35 to 162 with more than 200,000 members.&lt;ref name=seton162/&gt;&lt;ref name=leoni251&gt;Leoni, ''Storia dei partiti politici italiani'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Im2XqQWy1QYC&amp;pg=PA251 p. 251]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21–22, 1893, a Congress was held in Palermo attended by 500 delegates from nearly 90 leagues and socialist circles. A Central Committee was elected, composed of nine members: [[Giacomo Montalto]] for the [[province of Trapani]], [[Nicola Petrina]] for the [[province of Messina]], [[Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida]] for the [[province of Catania]], [[Luigi Leone]] for the [[province of Siracusa]], [[Antonio Licata]] for the [[province of Agrigento]], [[Agostino Lo Piano Pomar]] for the [[province of Caltanissetta]], [[Rosario Garibaldi Bosco]], [[Nicola Barbato]] and [[Bernardino Verro]] for the [[province of Palermo]].&lt;ref name=sic240509&gt;{{it icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20141017225802/http://www.cittanuove-corleone.it/La%20Sicilia%2C%20Il%20battesimo%20del%20Socvialismo%20a%20Palermo%2024.05.2009.pdf Il «battesimo» del socialismo], La Sicilia, May 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Congress decided that all Leagues were obliged to join the Italian Workers' Party (''[[Partito dei Lavoratori Italiani]]''), the predecessor of the PSI.&lt;ref name=scolaro18/&gt;

In July 1893 a peasant conference at Corleone drafted model agrarian contracts for labourers, sharecroppers and tenants and presented them to the landowners. When those refused to negotiate, a strike against landowners and against state taxes broke out over a large part of western Sicily. The so-called ''Patti di Corleone'' (Corleone Covenants), are considered by historians to be the first trade union collective contract in capitalist Italy.&lt;ref name=patti&gt;{{it icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20120226141104/http://www.cittanuove-corleone.it/La_Sicilia,_La_Firma_dei_Patti_di_Corleone_14.09.2008.pdf La firma dei «Patti di Corleone»], La Sicilia, September 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In September the state authorities intervened and some of the landowners were persuaded to capitulate. Elsewhere the strike continued until November 1893. Railwaymen of Catania and Palermo, the sulphur-miners and many other workers followed their example winning higher wages or better working conditions.&lt;ref name=cartosio/&gt;&lt;ref name=seton162/&gt;

In October 1893, a congress of miners was held in [[Grotte, Sicily|Grotte]] in the [[Province of Agrigento]] which was attended by some 1,500 people, including workers and small producers. The miners demanded that the minimum age to be raised to 14 years for those who worked in the sulfur mines, the decrease of working hours and setting a minimum wage. Small producers demanded measures to avoid exploitation by large owners. The minimum-age measure was meant to improve the situation for the ''[[Carusu|carusi]]'', minors that worked in conditions of near-slavery that sparked public outrage and inspired many complaints.&lt;ref name=santino&gt;{{it icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20140305010107/http://www.centroimpastato.it/publ/online/movimento_contadino.php3 Movimento contadino e sindacale], Umberto Santino, Narcomafie, Nr. 2, February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The successful struggle convinced the Sicilian ruling elite that the "upheaval" had to be stopped. They were seized by panic and some even demanded the closing of all schools to halt the spread of subversive doctrines. Prefects and frightened local councils bombarded Rome with requests for the immediate suppression of the Fasci. Despite the heavy pressure from the King, the army and conservative circles in Rome, however, Giolitti would neither treat strikes – which were not illegal – as a crime nor dissolve the Fasci nor authorise the use of firearms against popular demonstrations.&lt;ref name=degrand&gt;De Grand, ''The hunchback's tailor'', pp. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt; His policy was “to allow these economic struggles to resolve themselves through amelioration of the condition of the workers” and not to interfere in the process.&lt;ref name=seton162/&gt;

==Rising tensions==
[[File:Francesco Crispi.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Prime Minister Francesco Crispi]]
Nonetheless, Giolitti acknowledged the need to stifle the agitation. From May 1893 onwards, leaders of the Fasci were arrested occasionally and police and military reinforcements were sent to Sicily. In the autumn of 1893 the leadership lost control over the Fasci and the popular agitation got out of hand. Peasant squatters seized land, violent crowds demonstrated for work and against local misgovernment, tax offices were burnt down and clashes with the police grew more frequent and bloody. The violent social conflict almost rose to the point of [[insurrection]]. The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene.&lt;ref name=seton162/&gt;

However, his attitude could not be maintained. Landowners were infuriated by the unwillingness of the government to use force, while the peasants were annoyed by the unwillingness to redistribute land from the [[latifundia]].&lt;ref name=clark124/&gt; Landowners matched the strike with a [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]], and many peasants, probably a majority in the strike centres, were left without tenancies when the planting season ended in mid-December.&lt;ref name=alcorn&gt;Alcorn, ''Revolutionary Mafiosi.''&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1893 the failure of the Giolitti government to restore public order gave rise to a general demand that Crispi should return to power. Giolitti had to resign on November 24, 1893, as a result of the [[Banca Romana scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1893/11/25/109734699.pdf Cabinet Forced To Resign; Italian Ministers Called "Thieves" by the People], The New York Times, November 25, 1893&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the unrest in Sicily, a wave of rioting spread through Italy in August 1893, triggered by the [[Massacre of the Italians at Aigues-Mortes|killing of a number of migrant workers in the salt pans of Aigues Mortes]] in southern France escalated into a more generalized working-class revolt supported by anarchists and violent riots in Rome and Naples. Italy seemed to be slipping to a revolution. By the time Crispi returned to power in December 1893, Italy appeared to many to be on the brink of collapse.&lt;ref name=duggan340&gt;Duggan, ''The Force of Destiny'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=lSRwOZ0Yxw8C&amp;pg=PA340 p. 340]&lt;/ref&gt; Crispi promised important measures of land reform for the near future. He was not blind to the misery and the need for social reform. Before 1891 he had been the patron of the Sicilian working-class and many of their associations had been named after him. Colajanni, the chief architect of Giolitti’s fall by exposing the ''Banca Romana'' scandal, was first offered the Ministry of Agriculture, which he refused, then sent to Sicily on a mission of appeasement.&lt;ref name=seton165&gt;Seton-Watson, ''Italy from liberalism to fascism'', pp. 165-67&lt;/ref&gt;

Crispi’s good intentions got lost in the outcry for strong measures. In the three weeks of uncertainty before the government was formed, the rapid spread of violence drove many local authorities to defy Giolitti’s ban on the use of firearms. In December 1893, 92 peasants lost their lives in clashes with the police and army. Government building were burned as well as flour mills and bakeries that refused to lower their prices when taxes were lowered or abolished.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1893/12/27/109716817.pdf Shot Down by the Soldiers; Four of the Mob Killed in an Anti-Tax Riot in Sicily], The New York Times, December 27, 1893&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1894/01/03/106092087.pdf Sicily Under Mob Control; A Series of Antitax Riots in The Island], The New York Times January 3, 1894&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven people were killed on December 10, 1893, in [[Giardinello massacre|Giardinello]] after a rally that asked for the abolition of taxes on food and disbandment of the local field guards (''guardie campestri''). The protestors carried the portrait of the King taken from the municipality and burned tax files. On December 17, 1893, many people were wounded when troops fired on a manifestation in [[Monreale]]. Another 11 protestors were killed in [[Lercara Friddi massacre|Lercara Friddi]] on December 25.&lt;ref name=sic111211&gt;{{it icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20130531210704/http://www.cittanuove-corleone.it/La%20Sicilia%2C%20la%20strage%20di%20Giardinello%2011.12.2011.pdf La strage di Giardinello], La Sicilia, December 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cola178&gt;Colajanni, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30984/30984-h/30984-h.htm Gli avvenimenti di Sicila e le loro cause]'', pp. 178-79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scolaro57&gt;{{it icon}} Scolaro, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NeV8U-mG3zkC Il movimento antimafia siciliano]'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 1894, 20 people were killed and many wounded in [[Gibellina]] and [[Pietraperzia]].

The disorders were not the product of a revolutionary plot, but Crispi chose to believe otherwise. On the basis of dubious documents and reports, Crispi claimed that there was an organised conspiracy to separate Sicily from Italy; the leaders of the Fasci conspired with the clerics and were financed by French gold, and war and invasion were looming.&lt;ref name=seton165/&gt;&lt;ref name=duggan342&gt;Duggan, ''The Force of Destiny'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=lSRwOZ0Yxw8C&amp;pg=PA342 p. 342]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1894/01/06/104103998.pdf Trouble Has Been Long Brewing; Quantities of Arms and Ammunition in Hands of Revolutionists], The New York Times, January 6, 1894&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crackdown==
On January 3, 1894, Crispi declared a [[state of siege]] throughout Sicily. Army reservists were recalled and General [[Roberto Morra di Lavriano]] was dispatched with 40,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1894/01/04/106092311.pdf The Italian Government Alarmed; More Troops Called Out for Service in Sicily], The New York Times, January 4, 1894&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1894/01/05/106092650.pdf Martial Law Proclaimed In Sicily; Stern Measures Resorted To to Quiet the Anti-Tax Troubles], The New York Times, January 5, 1894&lt;/ref&gt; The old order was restored through the use of extreme force, including [[summary executions]].&lt;ref name=seton165/&gt; The Fasci were outlawed, the army and the police killed scores of protesters, and wounded hundreds. Thousands of militants, including all the leaders, were put in jail or sent into internal exile.&lt;ref name=cartosio/&gt; Some 1,000 persons were deported to the penal islands without trial. All working-class societies and cooperatives were dissolved and the [[freedom of the press]], [[Freedom of assembly|meeting]] and [[freedom of association|association]] were suspended. A [[Lunigiana revolt|solidarity revolt]] of anarchists and republicans in the [[Lunigiana]] was crushed as well.&lt;ref name=seton165/&gt; The government also seized the opportunity to 'revise' the [[electoral register]]s. In Catania 5,000 of the 9,000 electors were struck off.&lt;ref name=clark126&gt;Clark, ''Modern Italy, 1871 to the present'', p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of January, 1894 a meeting of the Central Committee of the Fasci took place in Palermo to discuss the position of the movement. Two sharply contrasting positions emerged. De Felice Giuffrida, known for his anarchist tendencies, supported the need to take advantage of the situation of unrest to provoke a revolution on the island. However, the majority took an opposite view, arguing the need to proceed peacefully. A revolt was not only inappropriate, but it would be detrimental to the movement. The meeting condemned the violent incidents in various parts of the island, and launched an appeal to stay calm and not to retaliate. In the end De Felice Giuffrida accepted the position of the majority. But the die was cast for the authorities to arrest De Felice, Montalto, Petrina, and others. Garibaldi Bosco, Barbato and Verro were arrested on board the steamship ''Bagnara'' that was about to leave for [[Tunis]].&lt;ref name=seton165/&gt;&lt;ref name=siino&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.amiciziafraipopoli.org/documenti-siino-fasci.htm I Fasci dei lavoratori in Sicilia], by Pietro Siino, Società Siciliana per l'Amicizia fra i Popoli&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 1894 Crispi presented the "evidence" for a widespread [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] in [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|parliament]]: the so-called "International Treaty of [[Bisacquino]]", signed by the [[Third French Republic|French Government]], the [[Czar of Russia]], Giuseppe De Felice, the anarchists and the [[Holy See|Vatican]], with the goal to detach Sicily from the rest of the country and put it under a Franco-Russian protectorate.&lt;ref name=sic080112&gt;{{it icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20140306193222/http://www.cittanuove-corleone.it/La%20Sicilia%2C%20Una%20Via%20dei%20Fasci%20Siciliani%20in%20ogni%20Comune%20%2008.01.2012.pdf I contadini in ginocchio], La Sicilia, January 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical]] deputy [[Felice Cavallotti]] ridiculed the conspiracy of Crispi, poking fun at "the famous treaty between the Emperor of Russia, the President of the French Republic, and Mr De Felice". The so-called "Treaty of Bisacquino" was so named not because it was signed in the Sicilian town, but because it had been invented by the Director of Public Safety of Bisacquino, the Neapolitan Sessi.&lt;ref name=sic070111&gt;{{it icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20140306193125/http://www.cittanuove-corleone.it/La%20Sicilia%2C%20Crispi%20sciolse%20i%20Fasci%20contadini%2007.01.2011.pdf Crispi sciolse i Fasci contadini], La Sicilia, January 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial in Palermo==
[[File:Fasci Siciliani Trial.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The heads of the ''Fasci Siciliani'' in the courtroom cage at the trial in April 1894]]
The trials of the central committee of the Fasci, that took place in Palermo in April and May 1894, were the final blow to the movement. In spite of an eloquent defence, which turned the Court into a political platform and thrilled every socialist in the country, they were condemned to heavy sentences of imprisonment.&lt;ref name=seton165/&gt; On May 30, 1894, the leaders of the movement received their sentence: Giuseppe de Felice Giuffrida to 18 years and Rosario Bosco, Nicola Barbato and Bernardino Verro to 12 years in jail.&lt;ref name=patti/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1894/05/31/106867139.pdf Sicilian Rioters Sentenced], The New York Times, May 31, 1894&lt;/ref&gt;

“In front of you,” Barbato told the judges, “we provided the documents and evidence of our innocence. My friends thought it necessary to support their defence legally; I will not do so. Not because I have no confidence in you, but it is the law that does not concern me. So I do not defend myself. You have to sentence: we are the elements that destroy your sacred institutions. You have to sentence: it is logical, human. I will always pay tribute to your loyalty. But we say to our friends outside: do not ask for pardon, do not ask for amnesty. Socialist civilization should not begin with an act of cowardice. We demand a condemnation, we do not ask for mercy. Martyrs are more useful to the holy cause than any propaganda. Condemn us!” &lt;ref name=barbato&gt;{{it icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20140306204412/http://www.cittanuove-corleone.it/La%20Sicilia%2C%20L%27autodifesa%20di%20Nicola%20Barbato%2010.01.2010.pdf Il «manifesto» di Nicola Barbato], La Sicilia, January 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The heavy sentence aroused strong reactions in Italy and in the United States. In Palermo a group of students went to the [[Teatro Bellini]] and asked the orchestra to perform the hymn of [[Garibaldi]]. And the theatre applauded.&lt;ref name=barbato/&gt; In March 1896, after Crispi had to resign due to the humiliating defeat of the Italian army at [[Battle of Adwa]] in Ethiopia during [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]], the new government under Prime minister [[Antonio Di Rudinì]] recognized the excessive brutality of the repression. Many Fasci members were pardoned and released from jail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1896/03/14/105743818.pdf Pardon for Italian Socialists], The New York Times, March 14, 1896&lt;/ref&gt; Di Rudinì made it clear though that a reorganization of the Fasci would not be tolerated.&lt;ref name=cartosio/&gt;&lt;ref name=seton185&gt;Seton-Watson, ''Italy from liberalism to fascism'', pp. 185-86&lt;/ref&gt; After their release, De Felice, Barbato and Bosco were met by a large crowd of supporters in Rome, who released the horses form their carriage and dragged them to the hotel, cheering for socialism and denouncing Crispi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1896/03/18/106100527.pdf Freed Italians Unrepentant; Many Socialists Greet Giuseppe de Felice, Bosco, and Barbato], The New York Times, March 18, 1896&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The brutal repression backfired to some extent. The Fasci leaders used the military tribunals to make impassioned and well-reported speeches in their defence. The tribunals were too repressive and revolted the Liberal consciences of many Northern Italians. In an attempt to regain his former 'left wing', Crispi introduced a bill in July 1894 to take over large estates and uncultivated land. The idea was to rent out the land on long leases in medium-sized holdings and leaseholders would be given reduced credit and tax concessions. While the bill failed to convince the Radicals and democrats of Crispi's good intentions, it angered the Sicilian landowners. After the suppression of the Fasci those were now unwilling to make any concessions. Under the leadership of Di Rudiní, they battled against the bill. When Crispi fell from power after Adwa in March 1896, their proponent Di Rudiní became Prime Minister and the Sicilian landowners were safe.&lt;ref name=clark126/&gt;

Nevertheless, the revolt inspired social reforms. In 1898 two measures of social legislation were passed by the minister of the treasury of Di Rudini’s cabinet, [[Luigi Luzzatti]]. The industrial workmen’s compensation scheme from 1883 was made obligatory with the employer bearing all costs; and a voluntary fund for contributory disability and old age pensions was created.&lt;ref name=seton185/&gt;

Many former adherents of the Fasci left Sicily. Life had grown hard and employment difficult to find because of their involvement with the movement. For those in Sicily who wanted to change their life for the better in those days, there were only two alternatives: rebel or emigrate. After the failure of the rebellion many peasants had no choice but to vote with their feet and opted for emigration.&lt;ref name=cartosio/&gt;&lt;ref name=clark126/&gt; Others remained, and a year later, in 1895, protests against unjust taxes and about the issue of communal land resumed in many towns in Sicily. The disbandment of troop had to be postponed.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,1/articleid,1230_01_1895_0229_0001_18164935/anews,true/ Il malcontento in Sicilia], La Stampa, August 18, 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hobsbawm, the Fasci were a prime example of primitive agrarian movement that became modern by aligning itself with socialism and communism. Many of its leaders continued in the Socialist Party and continued the struggle for land rights and land reform once they were released. Despite the 1894 defeat, permanent movements were set up in some areas of Sicily using modern socialist models of organisation.&lt;ref name=hobsbawm101&gt;Hobsbawm, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sCK8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA101 Primitive rebels]'', pp. 101-105&lt;/ref&gt;

With the dissolution of the Fasci, the unrest on Sicily did not subside. In January 1898, peasants demanding work and bread ransacked the town hall in [[Siculiana]].&lt;ref name=sta030198&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,3/articleid,0021_01_1898_0003_0003_17975328/anews,true/ Gravi fatti in Sicilia], La Stampa, January 3, 1898&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1901, Sicilian peasants – following the example of numerous agrarian strikes that were affecting the whole of Italy – again set off a wave of agrarian unrest, conscious of the fact that in a way they resumed "the march abruptly interrupted in 1894 by the repression of the Fasci." Just as the Fasci movement, one of the main goals of the 1901 strikes and was a revision of the land leases to undermine the economic power of the [[Gabellotto|gabellotti]].&lt;ref name=scolaro89&gt;{{it icon}} Scolaro, ''Il movimento antimafia siciliano'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=NeV8U-mG3zkC&amp;pg=PA89 pp. 89-92]&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[First World War]] the communist movement In Sicily built on the incipient organisational structures of the Fasci, such as during the [[Biennio Rosso]]. The Fasci inspired social struggle in Sicily well into the 1950s.&lt;ref name=santino/&gt;

==The role of women==
The role of women in the Fasci siciliani was substantial,&lt;ref name=hobsbawm99&gt;Hobsbawm, ''Primitive rebels'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=sCK8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA99 p. 99]&lt;/ref&gt; but is regularly overlooked in historical accounts.&lt;ref name=rep090310&gt;{{it icon}} [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2010/03/09/anima-femminile-dei-fasci-siciliani.html L'anima femminile dei Fasci siciliani], La Repubblica, 9 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Women were often at the forefront of demonstrations and strikes, speaking in public meetings and conferences. During municipal elections they made sure that men were going to vote (women did not have the right to vote at the time). They patrolled the taverns to prevent the men from betraying the duty of militancy with bottles of wine. They also took care of many organizational aspects and were particularly active in proselytizing for the movement, decorating the stage of the rallies, preparing ceremonies such as the inauguration opening of the flag of the Fasci, and welcoming the leaders who came to the towns with flowers.&lt;ref name=rep090310/&gt;&lt;ref name=scolaro31&gt;{{it icon}} Scolaro, ''Il movimento antimafia siciliano'',  [https://books.google.com/books?id=NeV8U-mG3zkC&amp;pg=PA31 pp. 31-34]&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were among the most ardent. In some municipalities the women organized themselves into women's sections and in others even in exclusively female Fasci.&lt;ref name=scolaro31/&gt;&lt;ref name=guglielmo36&gt;Guglielmo, ''Living the Revolution'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=okLFdxiFLKEC&amp;pg=PA36 pp. 36-39]&lt;/ref&gt; The strongest and most numerous presence of women was in the Fascio of [[Piana degli Albanesi]], where over a thousand of the 3,500 members were women in a town of 9,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=rep090310/&gt; For the Fasci the women abandoned the Church, but not the religious sentiment, to protest against the priests, who had tried to frighten them and isolate them with the threat of excommunication.&lt;ref name=rep090310/&gt; In Piana the women organised a boycott of annual religious procession in protest of the priest’s opposition to the movement in 1893.&lt;ref name=guglielmo36/&gt;&lt;ref name=sic060212&gt;{{it icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20140307165245/http://www.cittanuove-corleone.it/La%20Sicilia%2C%20Donne%20ribelli%20nella%20Sicilia%20dei%20Fasci%2006.02.2011.pdf Donne ribelli nella Sicilia dei Fasci], La Sicilia, February 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

At the congress in Palermo in May 1893 where the union of all the Fasci in Sicily was decided, Maria Cammarata, of the Fascio of Piana, urged the audience to ensure the registration of women.&lt;ref name=rep090310/&gt; The presence and political sophistication of the female representatives at the congress surprised the editor of  the ''Giornale di Sicilia'': "I could not believe it myself. They spoke loudly and clearly, with ease and astonishing courage."&lt;ref name=guglielmo36/&gt; One of the most prominent women was Marietta De Felice Giuffrida, the daughter of Giuseppe de Felice Giuffrida – one of the founders of the movement. Only 14 years old, she accompanied her father throughout Sicily to help him setting up Fasci in the interior. She was "extraordinarily animated by the spirit of socialism, who spoke to the people with a fervour of a missionary, and because of her sex and age, she commanded the fascination of the masses."&lt;ref name=guglielmo36/&gt;

The authorities watched the Fasci closely and in a report to the government in Rome noticed that the female Fasci in Piana, [[Belmonte Mezzagno]] and [[San Giuseppe Jato]] should be considered as dangerous. The women had developed "highly successful propaganda activities and revolutionary agendas, through which they exercised considerable influence on the other fasci in the region."&lt;ref name=guglielmo36/&gt;

== Mafia involvement ==
Some historians emphasize that the leagues were engaged in class struggle against a coalition of landowners and mafiosi and ignore evidence of strategic alliances between the Fasci and [[the Mafia]].&lt;ref name=santino/&gt;&lt;ref name=alcorn/&gt; The leagues were not only led by socialists and anarchists; some were run by local gentry and mafiosi.&lt;ref name=clark124/&gt; The Mafia bosses [[Vito Cascioferro]] and [[Nunzio Giaimo]] led the Fasci in [[Bisacquino]] in alliance with Verro. The Mafia was sometimes needed to enforce flying pickets with credible threats of violence and to make the strike costly to landowners by destroying their property.&lt;ref name="alcorn"/&gt;

In order to give the strike teeth and to protect himself from harm, Verro became a member of a Mafia group in Corleone, the ''Fratuzzi'' (Little Brothers).&lt;ref name=alcorn/&gt; However, during the great strike of the Fasci in September 1893, the ''Fratuzzi'' mobilized to boycott it, providing the necessary manpower to work on the lands that the peasants refused to cultivate. After that, Verro broke away from the mafiosi, and – according to police reports – became their most bitter enemy. He was killed by the Mafia in 1915 when he was the mayor of Corleone.&lt;ref name=verro&gt;{{it icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20140112090953/http://www.cittanuove-corleone.it/Corleone%2C%20anniversario%20assassinio%20Verro.html Verro, una vita contro la mafia], Città Nuova di Corleone, November 3, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Furness General Hospital scandal''' involves an investigation by [[Cumbria Constabulary]] and other government and public bodies into the deaths of several mothers and newborn babies, during the 2000s at [[Furness General Hospital]] (FGH) in [[Barrow-in-Furness]], [[Cumbria]], [[England]]. Cases date back to 2004, with a number of major incidents occurring in 2008. The death of Joshua Titcombe and a suppressed report by the [[Morecambe Bay NHS Trust]] brought the spotlight onto FGH in 2011 when investigations began.&lt;ref name=MorecambeReport/&gt; Claims of medical records being intentionally destroyed alongside the discovery of major wrongdoing on behalf of midwives led to threats of closure to the maternity ward.&lt;ref name=CQC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/news/9289481.Axe_threat_to_Furness_General_Hospital_unit/ |title=Axe threat to Furness General Hospital unit|first=Emma|last=Lidiard|work=[[The Westmorland Gazette]]|location=Kendal|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scandal was covered in a 2012 [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' episode titled "How Safe is Your Hospital?" with the [[Stafford Hospital scandal]]. In June 2013, Cumbria Constabulary announced they would only be pursuing the Titcombe case and that other complaints would not proceed to a criminal prosecution.&lt;ref name=Cumbriapolicenarrow&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-22906528|title=Furness General Hospital police probe narrowed|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=24 June 2013|date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same month, the British medical community was rocked by allegations that the [[Care Quality Commission]], which took part in investigations, was fully aware of concerns of maternity care at FGH as early as 2008 and gave the hospital a clean bill of health in 2010, having destroyed evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name=CQCcoverup&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23027438|title=Ex-CQC executive denies Cumbria baby death cover-up claim|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=24 June 2013|date=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The independently issued Morecambe Bay Investigation Report was published in 2015, stating a 'lethal mix' of 'serious and shocking' failings had led to the deaths of eleven babies and one mother.&lt;ref name=MorecambeReport&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-31699607|title=Furness baby deaths inquiry: 'Lethal mix of failures'|work=[[BBC News]]|first=Nick|last=Triggle|accessdate=3 March 2015|date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report recommended a national review of maternity care and thorough investigations of staff members involved by the [[General Medical Council]] and [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]].&lt;ref name=MorecambeReport/&gt; Numerous investigations have discovered serious failings, corruption and [[cover-up]]s on every level; investigations continue and no individual has been held accountable for the deaths at FGH. The criminal investigation into the scandal was concluded in April 2015 with no prosecutions.&lt;ref name=Criminalpros&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-32433383|title=Joshua Titcombe death: No prosecutions after police probe|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=26 April 2015|date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cases==
Police did not announce the number of deaths being investigated but six known are listed below.&lt;ref name=Lawsuit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-15443382|title=Ulverston man sues hospital over deaths of wife and baby|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=1 November 2011|date=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several families of the victims have revealed that they are suing the [[University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust]], claiming clinical negligence. The claim of Carl Hendrickson (husband and father of Nittaya and Chester Hendrickson respectively) alone is expected to exceed £50,000.&lt;ref name=Lawsuit/&gt;
* Niran Aukhaj collapsed and died in April 2008 also claiming the life of her unborn child. An inquest revealed that FGH failed to monitor her high blood pressure a week earlier.&lt;ref name=2011investigaion/&gt; 
* In July 2008, Thai-born Nittaya Hendrickson and her son died at FGH after she suffered an [[amniotic fluid embolism]]. Her husband claims records showing her heart rate during the birth have gone missing.&lt;ref name=2011investigaion/&gt;
* In September 2008, Liza Brady's newborn baby died shortly before birth. It was alleged that midwives delayed in delivering him, despite signs of distress.&lt;ref name=2011investigaion/&gt;
* An initial inquest into the death of nine-day-old Joshua Titcombe at FGH revealed the infection that killed him could easily have been treated if noticed by midwives. His parents Hoa and [[James Titcombe|James]] claim that their pleas for antibiotics to be given to their son were ignored.&lt;ref name=Joshua&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2000204/Coroner-blasts-hospital-newborn-baby-died-staff-repeatedly-failed-spot-common-infection.html?ITO=1490|title='It was a cover-up': Coroner launches stinging attack on 11 midwives who failed to spot baby's infection and then 'conspired to hide negligence'|work=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=1 November 2011|location=London|first=Chris|last=Brooke|date=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cumbria Constabulary and CQC investigations==
In September 2011, Cumbria Constabulary assigned 15 officers to investigate the deaths of at least four babies and two mothers during 2008 at FGH; it is alleged that midwives at the hospital destroyed medical records to cover up their mistakes.&lt;ref name=2011investigaion&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2036057/Police-probe-baby-deaths-Missing-records-maternity-unit-mothers-lost-lives.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|title=Police probe four baby deaths: Missing records in maternity unit where two mothers also lost lives|work=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=1 November 2011|location=London|first=Jo|last=MacFarlane|date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 September, several national newspapers reported that [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] played a role in the hospital's wrongdoings after it was revealed 83 percent of serious incidents at FGH in 2008 involved ethnic minorities,&lt;ref name=2011investigaion2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/baby-deaths-too-early-to-say-if-race-played-a-role-1.877650|title=Baby deaths: 'Too early to say if race played a role'|work=[[North-West Evening Mail]]|location=Barrow-in-Furness|accessdate=1 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401151859/http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/baby-deaths-too-early-to-say-if-race-played-a-role-1.877650|archivedate=1 April 2015|via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while only 2 percent of Barrow's population is non-white.&lt;ref name=Ethnicity&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&amp;b=276911&amp;c=barrow&amp;d=13&amp;e=13&amp;g=431959&amp;i=1001x1003x1004&amp;m=0&amp;r=1&amp;s=1315929491155&amp;enc=1&amp;dsFamilyId=1812|title=Resident Population Estimates by Ethnic Group (Percentages)|work=[[Office for National Statistics]]|accessdate=1 November 2011|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cumbria Constabulary have however refused to pursue the racial angle of the crime.&lt;ref name=2011investigaion2/&gt;

Other bodies involved in the investigation include health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission and the Nursing and Midwifery Council. A report by the CQC threatened to close the maternity ward at FGH by 21 November 2011 if major changes were not implemented.&lt;ref name=CQC/&gt; The NMC identified 19 areas requiring urgent improvement, including governance, risk management, collaborative working and leadership.&lt;ref name=NMC&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-15257981|title=Barrow hospital maternity unit given recommendations|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=1 November 2011|date=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2011, during the height of the investigation, leaked figures revealed that FGH had the worst mortality rate of any hospital in England.&lt;ref name=Mortality1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/millom/FGH-mortality-rate-figures-leaked-9bc8f8b8-b9c6-4469-85d7-7bd587613515-ds|title=FGH mortality rate figures leaked|work=[[North-West Evening Mail]]|location=Barrow-in-Furness|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Standardized mortality ratio|mortality ratio]] for the [[University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust]] (which also runs hospitals in Lancaster and Kendal) stood at 124, significantly higher than national average.&lt;ref name=Mortality2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-15386807|title=South Cumbrian hospitals 'have worst mortality ratio'|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=1 November 2011|date=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suspected that up to 16 babies and two mothers died at FGH due to poor care with over 30 claims for compensation; despite this Cumbria police narrowed their investigation in 2013 to focus on the death of just one child and decided not to prosecute over any of the other deaths.&lt;ref name=Cumbriapolicenarrow/&gt;

===Care Quality Commission controversy===
In August 2012 new [[Care Quality Commission]] (CQC) chief executive [[David Behan]] commissioned a report by management consultants [[Grant Thornton]].&lt;ref name="dominiczak"&gt;{{Cite news|title=NHS Watchdog accused of hospital 'cover-up' still not fit for purpose, chairman admits |first=Peter |last=Dominiczak |date=19 June 2013 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10129223/Watchdog-accused-of-hospital-cover-up-still-not-fit-for-purpose-chairman-admits.html |accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report examining the CQCs response to complaints about baby and maternal deaths and injuries at Furness General Hospital, was instigated by a complaint from a member of the public and "an allegation of a 'cover-up', submitted by a [[whistleblower]] at CQC."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Care Quality Commission re: Project Ambrose |work=Care Quality Commission |date=14 June 2013 |url=http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/documents/grant_thornton_uk_llp_morecambe_bay.pdf |accessdate=19 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717143550/http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/documents/grant_thornton_uk_llp_morecambe_bay.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news|date=19 June 2013 |title=Healthcare regulator CQC 'may have covered up failings'|work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22964433 |accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published on 19 June 2013.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{Cite news|title=NHS watchdog covered-up scandal at hospital where eight babies died of neglect |first=Charlie |last=Cooper |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nhs-watchdog-coveredup-scandal-at-hospital-where-eight-babies-died-of-neglect-8664224.html |accessdate=19 June 2013 |date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the findings, the CQC was "accused of quashing an internal review that uncovered weaknesses in its processes" and had allegedly "deleted the review of their failure to act on concerns about University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust". One CQC employee claimed that he was instructed by a senior manager "to destroy his review because it would expose the regulator to public criticism".&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt; The report concluded "We think that the information contained in the [deleted] report was sufficiently important that the deliberate failure to provide it could properly be characterised as a 'cover-up'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cover-up over hospital scandal |first=Laura |last=Donnelly |date=18 Jun 2013 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10128886/Cover-up-over-hospital-scandal.html |accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June 2013, Behan and Prior agreed to release the names of redacted senior managers within the Grant Thornton report, who were alleged had suppressed the internal CQC report. The people named were the former CQC Chief Executive [[Cynthia Bower]], deputy CEO Jill Finney and media manager Anna Jefferson, who were all said by Grant Thornton to be present at a meeting where deletion of a critical report was allegedly discussed.

==Morecambe Bay Investigation==
The Morecambe Bay Investigation Report was the independent public inquiry conducted by Bill Kirkup on behalf of the government into maternity and neonatal services and care at FGH, between 2004 and 2013. It was published in March 2015 with a damning verdict.&lt;ref name=MorecambeReport/&gt; The report stated the deaths of eleven babies and one mother at FGH were avoidable and a result of a 'lethal mix' of failings.&lt;ref name=MorecambeReport/&gt; Amongst the findings were that the maternity unit had been 'dysfunctional', with 'substandard care' provided by staff 'deficient in skills and knowledge'. Working relationships between doctors and midwives had been extremely poor, there had been 'significant organisational failure' on behalf of the Care Quality Commission and the North West Health Authority and Parliamentary and the Health Services Ombudsman had failed to take opportunities that could have brought the problems to light sooner.&lt;ref name=MorecambeReport/&gt; The report also stated that the Department of Health had been reliant on misleadingly optimistic assessments from regulators; 44 recommendations were made in the report, ranging from action to be taken on midwives involved, to national reviews on maternity care.&lt;ref name=MorecambeReport/&gt;

The [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] was criticised by Kirkup, for the way it handled the investigation resulting from events at [[University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust]], relating to misconduct by two midwives involved in the Furness General Hospital scandal. He said their response to his report had "fallen far short of expectations". The [[Professional Standards Authority]] said the regulator's investigation  was "deficient" because evidence was not presented to the panel by the council even though it had it in its possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lintern|first1=Shaun|title=Kirkup outlines 'lamentable' NMC failures to health secretary|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/hsj-local/providers/university-hospitals-of-morecambe-bay-nhs-foundation-trust/kirkup-outlines-lamentable-nmc-failures-to-health-secretary/7004771.article|accessdate=31 July 2016|work=[[Health Service Journal]]|location=London||date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Furnished Houses (Rent Control) Act 1946''' was an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that and set up rent tribunals to control rents in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;The Longman Companion to The Labour Party 1900-1998 by Harry Harmer&lt;/ref&gt; and regulated renting prices. Following the [[Second World War]], the practice of limiting rent prices had been introduced due to the scarcity of rented property, which made it a "seller's market".

The Act was intended to stop the high prices in furnished properties being rented out; as they were furnished, they were not covered by previous Rent Acts.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (2007) p.554&lt;/ref&gt; It was given the [[Royal Assent]] on 26 March 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1946/mar/26/royal-assent#S5CV0421P0_19460326_HOC_423|title=ROYAL ASSENT (Hansard, 26 March 1946)|date=26 March 1946|publisher=[[Hansard]]|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was heavily influenced by the [[Ridley Committee]], established to investigate rent control methods, which reported in 1945.

The Act set up [[rent assessment committee]]s, which were given to districts after a consultation with the Minister of Health or his representative. Upon these tribunals being established in a district, they set a fixed maximum of rent for furnished dwellings, making it illegal for the landlord to charge more.&lt;ref&gt;G. (1946) p.170&lt;/ref&gt; The tribunals were criticised for their slow pace and for failing to charge landlords for previous exorbitant rent prices,&lt;ref&gt;Frances (1997) p.131&lt;/ref&gt; and the Act was repealed by Section 117 of the [[Rent Act 1968]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4ST8-6120-TWPY-Y1B2&amp;csi=274768&amp;oc=00240|title=Lexis@Library: Document|publisher=Lexis@Library|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Halachic state''' ({{lang-he|מדינת הלכה}}, ''Medinat ha-Halakha'') is the idea of a [[Jewish state]] governed by [[Halakha]], Jewish religious law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Features/Religious-Affairs-Whos-afraid-of-a-halachic-state Who's afraid of a halachic state? [[Jerusalem Post]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of a Jewish state in Halakha==
{{empty section|date=July 2018}}

==Public opinion==
An opinion poll released in March 2016 by the [[Pew Research Center]] found high support for a Halachic state among religious Israeli Jews. The poll found that 86% of Israeli [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jews]] and 69% of non-Haredi religious Jews support making Halacha Israel's legal code, while 57% of traditional Jews and 90% of secular Jews oppose such a move.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4775861,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support of religious political parties==
Just a couple of parties like [[Chayil Party|Chayil]] and [[Kahanism|Kahanist]] groups actively promote this (Kahanists such as [[Kach and Kahane Chai]] advocate the abolition of [[secular]] [[democracy]] and the creation of a Halakhic state in its stead). In contrast, [[United Torah Judaism]] (UTJ) and [[Shas]] believe that a Jewish-run state is halakhically forbidden until the Messianic age (based on the [[Three Oaths]]). Therefore, the aspiration is essentially messianic, and they are not trying to implement it. [[Meimad]] is the only Jewish religious political party in Israel that actively opposes a Halachic state.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  The [[National Religious Party]] wishes to increase the Jewish religious character of the state incrementally by influencing individuals.

==Support of Jewish religious leaders==
The [[Lubavitcher Rebbe]] advocated the transformation of Israel into a Halachic state after the Messiah comes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otzar770.com/library/display_page.asp?nPageNumber=492&amp;ilSC=40&amp;nBookId=19&amp;cPartLetter=b]&lt;/ref&gt; He also pointed out many times that according to Jewish tradition, the arrival of the [[Moshiach]], the Jewish Messiah, would bring the [[Land of Israel]] to be under the rule of the Halacha. This state would be a [[monarchy]], with Moshiach at its head.

==Support of Knesset members and Israeli justices==
In 2009, Justice Minister [[Yaakov Neeman]] stated that "step by step, Torah law will become the binding law in the State of Israel. We have to reinstate the traditions of our forefathers, the teaching of the rabbis of the ages, because these offer a solution to all the issues we are dealing with today." He later retracted his statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Features/Religious-Affairs-Whos-afraid-of-a-halachic-state Who's afraid of a halachic state? [[Jerusalem Post]]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2002 [[Israel Prize]] winner [[Nahum Rakover]], who received the [[Yakir Yerushalayim]] prize for his research on the use of Jewish law in the legal system,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Twelve-given-Worthy-of-Jerusalem-award Twelve given the Worthy of Jerusalem Award, [[Jerusalem Post]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Neeman's opinion was nothing new. He said that the idea is supported in the Foundations of Law Act, passed in 1980, which encourages judges to use Jewish law in their decisions. Former president of the [[Israeli Supreme Court]], [[Yitzhak Kahan]], recommended that Jewish law be implemented even in cases of an existing precedent, although his opinion was not accepted, and former justice ministers [[Shmuel Tamir]] and [[Moshe Nissim]] advocated teaching judges and lawyers Jewish law to provide them with the necessary knowledge to implement the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Features/Religious-Affairs-Whos-afraid-of-a-halachic-state Who's afraid of a halachic state? [[Jerusalem Post]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanhedrin revival movement==
The [[2004 attempt to revive the Sanhedrin]] as an [[upper house]] in Israel (with either the resulting [[bicameral legislature]] or the [[lower house]] inheriting the title [[Knesset]]) was also regarded{{by whom|date=January 2014}} as an attempt to move the Israeli government to a halakhic state of governance and jurisprudence.

==National identity bill==
In 2014, [[Israel]]'s cabinet advanced a [[Basic Law proposal: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People|bill]] that would define Israel as "the nation-state of the Jewish people" and also said that Jewish law would be a "source of inspiration" for the Knesset. This was seen by non-Orthodox Jews as a step toward enforcing Orthodox halakha as the law of the land.&lt;ref name="halakhabill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.628501|title=Ultra-Orthodox and Reform Jews share distaste for nation-state bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harvard''' is a quiet affluent town in [[Worcester County, Massachusetts]]. The town is located 25 miles west-northwest of Boston, in eastern [[Massachusetts]]. A farming community settled in 1658 and incorporated in 1732, it has been home to several non-traditional communities, such as Harvard [[Shaker]] Village and the utopian [[Transcendentalist]] center [[Fruitlands (transcendental center)|Fruitlands]]. Today it is an affluent residential town noted for its excellent public schools, with its students consistently ranking in the state's top ten test results in English and math.&lt;ref name=mcas&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/special/education/mcas/scores08/10th_top_schools.htm |publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=2008-11-14 |title=Top Scoring MCAS schools | date=2008-09-23}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The population was 6,520 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].  &lt;!--Why is the next sentence included in the lead section, if at all?: The official seal of the town depicts the old town public library on The Common prior to renovations that removed the front steps.--&gt;

==History==
Europeans first settled in what later became Harvard in the 17th century, along a road connecting [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Lancaster]] with [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]] that was formally laid out in 1658. There were few inhabitants until after [[King Philip's War]], in which Groton and Lancaster were attacked and substantially destroyed. Over the next 50 years the population grew until it had reached a point adequate to support a church. A new town including parts of Lancaster, Groton, and [[Stow, Massachusetts|Stow]] was incorporated in 1732, subject to the proviso that the inhabitants "Settle a learned and Orthodox Minister among them within the space of two years and also erect an House for the publick Worship of God."  It is uncertain how the town obtained its name, though the Willard family, among the first settlers and the largest proprietors in the new town, had several connections to [[Harvard College]].&lt;ref&gt;Nourse, pp. 58-60.&lt;/ref&gt;   The first minister was Rev. [[John Seccombe]], serving from 1733-1757.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=zDydEUfKy20C&amp;pg=PA559&amp;lpg=PA559&amp;dq=“Father+Abbey’s+will”&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sR3NhZwaMs&amp;sig=Ddfl0RVVgwZy5Ju-WaEsywd9KSI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj_1NeikPXdAhVHtlkKHcOHC-w4ChDoATAHegQIAxAB#v=onepage&amp;q=“Father%20Abbey’s%20will”&amp;f=false History of Worcester County, Massachusetts, Embracing a ..., Volume 1 By Abijah Perkins Marvin, p.559]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1734, the town was considered to have five districts or villages. These were Oak Hill, Bare Hill, Still River, Old Mill and Shabikin, present day [[Devens, Massachusetts|Devens]].

One notable early enterprise based in Harvard was the Benjamin Ball Pencil Company&lt;ref&gt;https://www.officemuseum.com/pencil_history.htm#Note%202&lt;/ref&gt; which produced some of the first writing instruments made in the United States. They operated in the Old Mill district from 1830 to 1860. Despite this and other limited manufacturing, the town economy was primarily based on [[agriculture]] until the middle of the 20th century. This past is most prominently visible in the number of apple [[orchard]]s. It is now mostly a residential "bedroom community" for workers at companies in [[Boston]] and its suburbs. Harvard has had a relatively quiet history, but has attracted several "non-traditional" communities that have given its history some flavor.

===The Shakers===
One part of town is the site of [[Harvard Shaker Village Historic District|Harvard Shaker Village]], where a [[utopia]]n religious community was established.  During a period of religious dissent, a number of Harvard residents abandoned the Protestant church in Harvard. They built in 1769 a house that later became known as the Square House. The Shaker Founder [[Mother Ann Lee]] met with this group in 1781 and the group joined her [[United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing]], or Shakers.&lt;ref name = "NPS-Harvard-Shaker-Village"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = National Park Service, United States Department of Interior | title = Harvard Shaker Village Historic District | date = n.d. | author = National Park Service | work = Shaker Historic Trail | url = http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/shaker/har.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first Shaker settlement in Massachusetts and the second settlement in the United States.  The Harvard Shaker Village Historic District is located in the vicinity of Shaker Road, South Shaker Road, and Maple Lane. At its largest, the Shakers owned about 2,000 acres of land in Harvard. By 1890, the Harvard community had dwindled to less than 40, from a peak of about 200 in the 1850s. In 1917 the Harvard Shaker Village was closed and sold.  Only one Shaker building is open to the public, at [[Fruitlands Museum]]; the remaining surviving buildings are in private ownership.&lt;ref name = "NPS-Harvard-Shaker-Village"/&gt;

Nationally, 19 [[Shaker]] communities had been established in the 1700s and 1800s, mostly in northeastern United States. Community locations ranged from [[Maine]] to [[Kentucky]] and [[Indiana]].  The Shakers were renowned for plain architecture and furniture, and reached its national peak membership in the 1840s and 1850s.  The Shaker community's practice of celibacy meant that to maintain its population, it was always necessary to have new outsiders join.  The improving employment opportunities provided by the [[Industrial Revolution]] would over the middle decades of the 1800s diminish the attractions of joining the Shaker community. Today, only one church "society" remains open, run by the last Shakers at [[Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village]] in [[New Gloucester, Maine]].

===Fruitlands===
[[Amos Bronson Alcott]] relocated his family, including his ten-year-old daughter, [[Louisa May Alcott]], to Harvard in June 1843.  He and [[Charles Lane (transcendentalist)|Charles Lane]] attempted to establish a utopian [[transcendentalist]] [[socialist]] farm called [[Fruitlands (transcendental center)|Fruitlands]] on the slopes of Prospect Hill in Harvard. The experimental community only lasted 7 months, closing in January 1844. Fruitlands, so called "because the inhabitants hoped to live off the fruits of the land, purchasing nothing from the outside world,"&lt;ref name=Fruitlands&gt;[http://www.fruitlands.org/fruitlands_features/farmhouse Fruitlands Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024170313/http://www.fruitlands.org/fruitlands_features/farmhouse |date=2011-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; saw visits from the likes of [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].&lt;ref name=Compass&gt;Patricia Harris, Anna Mundow, David Lyon, James Marshall, Lisa Oppenheimer. Compass American Guides: Massachusetts, 1st Edition. Random House. 2003. Pg.186&lt;/ref&gt;  Louisa May Alcott used her experience at Fruitlands as an inspiration for her novel ''[[Little Women]]''.&lt;ref name=Fruitlands /&gt;

[[Clara Endicott Sears]], whose summer estate was also situated on Prospect Hill,&lt;ref name=Compass /&gt; restored Fruitlands and opened it as a museum in 1914.&lt;ref name=Fruitlands/&gt; On the grounds of Fruitlands Museum there is also a Shaker house, which was relocated there from Harvard's Shaker Village by Sears in 1920.  It is the first Shaker museum ever established in the United States.&lt;ref name=Compass /&gt;  In addition, Sears opened a gallery on the property dedicated to Native American history. Sears became interested in Native Americans after [[Nipmuck]] arrowheads were found around her property on Prospect Hill, which the Nipmuck Indians had called Makamacheckamucks.&lt;ref name=Kinnicutt&gt;Kinnicutt, Lincoln Newton. ''Indian Place Names in Worcester County Massachusetts''. Common Wealth Press. 1905. Pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, Sears' Fruitlands property spanned {{convert|458|acre|km2}}, but in 1939, {{convert|248|acre|km2}} were seized by [[eminent domain]] for expansion of [[Fort Devens]]. As of 2010, that land is now part of the [[Oxbow National Wildlife Refuge]].&lt;ref name=Fruitlands /&gt;

===Fiske Warren Tahanto Enclave===
[[Fiske Warren]], a follower of [[Henry George]], attempted to establish a [[single tax]] zone in Harvard in 1918. The enclave bought up land communally and attempted to manage the land according to George's principles. The enclave failed soon after Warren died in 1938.  His [[Frederick Fiske and Gretchen Osgood Warren House|house]] was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1996.

===St. Benedict Center===
Father [[Leonard Feeney]] was a [[Jesuit]] priest who held to a literal interpretation of the doctrine "[[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus]]".  His St Benedict Center at Harvard College in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] made numerous converts in the 1940s, among them [[Avery Dulles|Avery Cardinal Dulles]], the son of [[John Foster Dulles]], secretary of state in the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration.  Feeney was excommunicated in 1953. Cardinal Medeiros of Boston visited Feeney on his deathbed and apologized for the heavy-handed way he had been treated by the ecclesiastical authorities 30 years before. A branch of the Saint Benedict Center&lt;ref name="slavessr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sistersofstbenedictcenter.org/Our%20History.html |publisher=Sisters of Saint Benedict Center, Still River |accessdate=2008-06-22 |title=Our History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205004454/http://sistersofstbenedictcenter.org/Our%20History.html |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; is located in [[Still River, Massachusetts|Still River]], on the west side of Harvard.

===St. Benedict Abbey===
{{Main|St. Benedict Abbey (Massachusetts)}}
In Still River there is an abbey of [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine monks]] which branched from the St. Benedict Center. There are six brothers and seven&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abbey.org/abbot_gabriel.html Official Obituary of Abbot Gabriel Gibbs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005171242/http://abbey.org/Abbot_Gabriel.html |date=2011-10-05 }}, accessed 22 Nov. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; priests.

==Geography==
[[File:Harvard.jpeg|thumbnail|Harvard Common]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|27.0|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|26.4|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|0.6|sqmi}}, or 2.26%, is water.

The town is largely wooded with small rolling hills, fields and wetlands. In addition to the numerous streams and brooks throughout Harvard, Bare Hill Pond is a central, iconic locale.

Harvard and the surrounding area are renowned for apple orchards and riding stables.

===Surrounding towns===

As of the [[census]]&lt;ref name="GR2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=American FactFinder}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 2000, there were 5,981 people, 1,809 households, and 1,494 families residing in the town. The [[population density]] was 226.9 people per square mile (87.6/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). There were 2,225 housing units at an average density of 84.4 per square mile (32.6/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The racial makeup of the town was 91.69% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 4.50% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.17% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 1.97% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.05% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.50% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.12% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 6.09% of the population.

There were 1,809 households out of which 44.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 73.4% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 6.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 17.4% were non-families. 14.3% of all households were made up of individuals and 4.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.86 and the average family size was 3.18.

In the town the population was spread out with 26.6% under the age of 18, 4.0% from 18 to 24, 29.5% from 25 to 44, 32.3% from 45 to 64, and 7.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41 years. For every 100 females there were 124.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 133.6 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $117,934, and the median income for a family was $139,352. Males had a median income of $90,937 versus $49,318 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the town was $50,867. About 0.5% of families and 2.0% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 0.7% of those under age 18 and 7.1% of those age 65 or over.

The decline in the population of the town of Harvard from the 1990 census to the 2000 U.S. census is attributable to the 1996 closure of [[Fort Devens]], a U.S. military installation and the departure of military personnel and families residing at Fort Devens, which in large part is within the territory of the town of Harvard. The Fort Devens property has in large part been converted to civilian use, under the direction of [[Massachusetts Development Finance Agency|MassDevelopment]], a development authority of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

==Government==
The town elects five members to the [[Board of Selectmen]] to run the town day-to-day and has an annual [[Town Meeting]] to pass/amend the town bylaws and approve the town budget.

When the town constructed the current building housing [[the Bromfield School]] middle and high school, the town successfully resisted the Massachusetts School Building Authority efforts to regionalize its school system with other towns; the School Building Authority partially funds new school buildings and renovations.  Harvard's Kindergarten through grade twelve school system ranks among the top 5% of schools in the state according to some authorities, and more than 97% of its graduates go on to college. The public high school, the Bromfield School, and the Hildreth Elementary School are both located in the center of town on [[Route 111 (Massachusetts)|Massachusetts Avenue]] Bromfield has its ranks in nationwide tests in the top 20 and HES has them for MCAS (Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System) in the top 5.

{{Black Hebrews}}
'''The Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ''' ('''ICGJC''', also '''Israelite Church-God &amp; Jesus'''), formerly known as the '''Israeli Church of Universal Practical Knowledge''', is an organization of [[Black Hebrew Israelites]]. The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] has designated the ICGJC as an active [[hate group]].&lt;ref name="CNN Hate Group List"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andone|first1=Dakin|title=Here are all the active hate groups where you live|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/17/us/hate-groups-us-map-trnd/index.html|accessdate=17 August 2017|publisher=CNN|date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ICGJC teaches that the descendants of the lost [[12 tribes of Israel]] and true biblical [[Jews]] are the Black Americans/Negros, West Indians, and Native Americans of North and South America and those scattered throughout the whole planet, but not the Jewish people or the Africans. The group claims that the "Black Israelites" have [[chosen people|divine favor]] and inspiration and are superior to "[[Edom]]ites" ([[white people]]) and all other non-Israelite people. They also hold strong [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] views regarding the end of the world.&lt;ref name=Ready/&gt; The ICGJC believes that Yahawashi ([[Jesus]]) is God's divine Son and Messiah, and the redeemer for the sins of the Israelites and no other nation,&lt;ref name=Ready/&gt; that the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]] and [[Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical Books|Apocrypha]] are [[Biblical inspiration|inspired Scripture]], but the group does not believe in the doctrine of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref name=Ready/&gt;

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the group's leaders are "obsessed with hatred for Edomites", and it is one of several extremist/supremacist Hebrew Israelite groups that have expanded since 2000 from black inner-city neighborhoods on the East Coast to cities in 10 US states.&lt;ref name=splc-2003&gt;{{cite web|title=Racist Black Hebrew Israelites Becoming More Militant|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2003/racist-black-hebrew-israelites-becoming-more-militant|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=1 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}} Its headquarters are in New York City,&lt;ref name=CP&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zurowski|first1=Cory|title=Minnesota's Eight Active Hate Groups Are Struggling|url=http://www.citypages.com/news/minnesotas-eight-active-hate-groups-are-struggling-7394419|accessdate=6 August 2015|agency=City Pages|date=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=google&gt;{{cite web|title=Israelite Church-God &amp; Jesus, 1 W 125th St New York, NY 10027|url=https://plus.google.com/102848431396007441394/about?gl=us&amp;hl=en|website=google.com|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its leader is known as "Chief High Priest Tazadaqyah".&lt;ref name=Ready/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYDN/&gt;

==Black Hebrew Israelite groups==
Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ is the second largest [[Black Hebrew Israelite]] organization in the [[United States]], the first being the [[Nation of Yahweh]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} While "most Hebrew Israelites are neither explicitly [[racist]] nor [[anti-Semitic]] and do not advocate violence", the ICGJC is and does.&lt;ref name=Ready&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=941 |title='Ready for War' |accessdate=22 November 2008 |date=Fall 2008 |work=Intelligence Report |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=splc-2003/&gt;

This Israelite church, like most others, believes that their purported Israelite identity is based on the [[Bible]], history, and [[archaeology]]. According to some Black Hebrew Israelite Groups, the twelve tribes of Israel are Blacks only, and the understanding of the tribes is unknown.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Those groups teach that according to [[Amos 9:7]] "Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?" According to other groups, this means that all 12 tribes look like the Ethiopians which includes children of the slave-trade including all Africans. This belief has led some to ask who were the Hamites, Egyptians Canaanites, Jebusites, Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Perizzites, and the Hivites who were originally in Africa in the days of Moses.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

This Hebrew Israelite Group and most others teach that some of the twelve tribes of Israel are made up of lighter non-Spaniard Latin Americans and Native American Indians conquered and enslaved years ago; they are the northern kingdom of Israel that migrated "over the waters" [they believe this means to the Americas] during the reign of Cyrus the Persian King according to [[2 Esdras]] 13:40-45 and Deuteronomy 33:17. Some have mixed themselves among their captors which explains the lighter complexion and hair texture difference according to Hosea 7:8 "Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned." The Blacks who were enslaved in 1619 are the southern kingdom of Judah according to Joel 3:1-7. They base the list shown below on Genesis 49 and Deuteronomy 33.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==The 12 tribes of Israel (Black Hebrew Israelite)==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
[[File:Poster of Tribes of Israel Black Hebrews.jpg|thumb|Poster outlining the Black Hebrew Israelite identification of the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]] with modern peoples of color]]

According to the beliefs of the Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ, the twelve tribes of Israel have their order listing along with their respective national identities shown below:

*Judah: Negroes ([[African Americans]])
*Benjamin: [[Caribbean people|West Indian Blacks]]
*Levi: [[Haitians]]
*Sideon: [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominicans]]
*Zebulon: [[Guatemala]] to [[Panama]]
*Ephriam: [[Puerto Ricans]]
*Manasses: [[Cubans]]
*Gad: [[Native Americans in the United States|Native-American Indians]]
*Reuben: [[Seminole|Seminole Indians]]
*Asher: [[Colombia]] to [[Uruguay]]
*Naphtali: [[Argentina]]/[[Chile]]
*IssacharL [[Mexicans]]

==Ranking system==
There are a number of positions in the Israelite church which may only be filled by a high priest at the higher orders. Among these are [[Bishop]], [[High priest|Chief Priest]], Apostle, and/or Holy Apostle. These leaders are primarily responsible for the spiritual welfare of the members and the administration of local church units. But they have also subservient positions that are filled by other men when they are "elevated" by the "spirit". These are 13 shield generals, all the way down to 1 shield generals. Captains of 10,000 to Captains of 1,000. Top Officers of 5,000 down to Top Officers of 500. Officers of 100, and recruits.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Perhaps the most prominent leader of the church is [[Tazadaqyah]], a man who rose in to power of the church in the late 90's. Tazadaqyah is proclaimed by many of his followers to be the God-sent "Comforter" of the Nation of Israel. Tazadaqyah also holds the titles Holy Apostle, Chief Priest.

The Israelite Church and its various splinter groups can be loosely grouped together as sects, which advocate a [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] and [[King James Only|Authorized King James Version-only]] approach to the Bible (i.e. they only endorse the Hebrew/Greek and AKJV versions of the Bible), and the notion that Caucasians are Edomites.&lt;ref name="religioustolerance"&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/bhi.htm Black Hebrew Israelites (BHI)] - Religious Tolerance. Retrieved 7 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
In 2013, the Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ ordered action figures cast in the image of their leader (Chief High Priest Tazadaqyah) from a toymaker. When they received the dolls they sued the toymaker (Vicale Corp) because they didn't like the dolls. The church complained that the dolls didn't look like Tazadaqyah and weren't black enough, that the Connecticut toymaker put "pointed noses and faces" dolls. And half of them "were light brown" instead of "dark brown," according to the court papers.&lt;ref name=NYDN&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Barbara|last2=Siemaszko|first2=Corky|title=Harlem church sues toymaker Emil Vicale after talking doll in leader's likeness is not black enough|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/harlem-church-suing-leader-doll-not-black-article-1.1327823|accessdate=6 August 2015|work=New York Daily News|date=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enemies==
According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the group's enemies include white people, "who they preach are descended from a race of red, hairy beings, known as Edomites, who were spawned by Esau, the twin brother of Jacob" (later known as Israel) in the Old Testament. "Equally hated" are "fraudulent" Jews (i.e., the people known to the world today as Jews), "the synagogue of Satan," Asians, promiscuous black women, abortionists, continental Africans (who, according to ICGJC and other extremist Israelites, "sold the lost tribes of Israel, who were black, to European slave traders"), and gay people, who "according to extremist Israelites should all be put to death".&lt;ref name=splc-2003/&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}}

== Allegations of black supremacy and racism ==
In late 2008, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) described the ICGJC and other [[Black supremacy|black supremacist]] Hebrew Israelite groups as  "the extremist fringe" of the movement. It wrote that the members of such groups "believe that Jews are devilish impostors and ... openly condemn whites as evil personified, deserving only death or slavery". The SPLC also said that "most Hebrew Israelites are neither explicitly [[racist]] nor [[anti-Semitic]] and do not advocate violence".&lt;ref name="Ready"/&gt;&lt;ref name=splc-2003/&gt; In 2017, they listed the group as a black nationalist hate group.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article209939089.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Hebrew groups characterized as black supremacist by the SPLC include the [[Nation of Yahweh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2001/winter/popularity-and-populism |title=Popularity and Populism |accessdate=16 November 2011 |last=Potok |first=Mark |date=Winter 2001 |work=Intelligence Report |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name=Ready/&gt; Also, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] has written that the "12 Tribes of Israel" website, maintained by a Black Hebrew group, promotes hatred and black supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/poisoning_web/black_bigots.asp |title=Poisoning the Web: African-American Anti-Semitism |accessdate=22 November 2008 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fraud and tax evasion charges ==
In April 2018, the leader of ICGJC Jermaine Grant and ICGJC treasurer Lincoln Warrington were arrested on fraud and tax charges. The [[United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey]] alleged the men "used their positions to divert millions of dollars for Grant’s personal use and benefit." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/two-new-jersey-men-arrested-evading-taxes-53-million-taken-new-york-religious |title=Two New Jersey Men Arrested For Evading Taxes On $5.3 Million Taken From New York Religious Organization |accessdate=29 April 2018 |year=2018 |publisher=[[United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant has pleaded "not guilty".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.app.com/story/news/local/courts/2018/05/08/jermaine-grant-pleads-not-guilty/590845002/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Initial Jobless Claims''' is a report issued by the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] on a weekly basis. The employment situation is extremely important for a macroeconomic analysis, so the financial markets track employment indicators, although this is a low impact indicator compared with the monthly BLS's "Employment Report". This report tracks how many new people have filed for [[unemployment benefits]] in the previous week. It is a good gauge of the U.S. job market. For instance, when more people file for unemployment benefits, fewer people have jobs, and vice versa. Investors can use this report to gather pertinent information about the economy, but it's a very volatile data, so the four-week average of jobless claims is monitored. 

The report is released at 08:30 Eastern Time on Thursdays and can be a market moving event. 

Initial jobless claims measure emerging unemployment, and it is released after one week, but continued claims data measure the number of persons claiming unemployment benefits, and it is released one week later than the initial claims, that's the reason initial have a higher impact in the financial markets.

'''José María Figueres Olsen''' (born 24 December 1954 in [[San José, Costa Rica]]) is a [[Costa Rica]]n businessman and politician. After he left the presidency of Costa Rica in 1998, Figueres has also been involved in global issues such as climate change, [[sustainable development]], and technology. He started his career as an engineer working in [[agribusiness]]. After a decade, he entered public service as Minister of Foreign Trade and then Minister of Agriculture. In 1994, he was elected [[President of Costa Rica]], as the nation's youngest elected president of the 20th century. In 2000, he joined the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, and later he worked with Concordia 21 in Madrid. Since 2010, he has been Chairman of the [[Carbon War Room]], an independent non-profit organization focused on the global transition to a [[low-carbon economy]]. On 27 March 2012, Sir Richard Branson announced that he was appointed as the new President of the Carbon War Room.

==Biography==
José María Figueres is the son of [[José Figueres Ferrer]] (affectionately known as Don Pepe), who was a three-time [[President of Costa Rica]]. His mother, [[Karen Olsen Beck]], an American [[social worker]] born to [[Denmark|Danish]] immigrant parents, later adopted Costa Rican nationality.&lt;ref name=shtrib&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=American Girl and Costa Rican President Wed |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19540208&amp;id=lSAhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0mQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1370,1466860&amp;hl=en |work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |date=1954-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving as [[First Lady]], she was appointed [[Ambassador]] to Israel in 1982. In 1990, she was elected [[Member of Congress]] for the 1990–1994 legislature.

Figueres grew up in La Lucha, a farm community his father Don Pepe founded in 1928. There José María attended the public school Cecilia Orlich Figueres, before going on to study at the Colegio Humboldt and later at the Lincoln High School, both in San José.

Figueres has three younger siblings, [[Christiana Figueres]], Mariano and Kirsten. [[Christiana Figueres]] was Executive Director of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UNFCCC]], responsible for international climate change negotiations. From the first marriage of his father, Figueres has an older brother, Marti, and a sister, Muni. [[Muni Figueres]] has held various public positions, and since 2010 she has served as the Costa Rican Ambassador to the United States.

José María has two children from his first marriage to former [[First Lady of Costa Rica|First Lady]] [[Josette Altmann Borbón]], José María and Eugenia. The marriage between Figueres and Altmann ended in divorce. He is currently married to Cinthya Berrocal Quirós.

==Education==
Figueres completed his undergraduate studies at the [[United States Military Academy]] ([[West Point]]), where he graduated in the Class of 1979 with a major in Engineering.  While attending West Point, he attended and completed the U.S. Army's Ranger Training Course in 1975.  He was awarded the Army Ranger tab and was the class Distinguished Honor Graduate.

Later, he continued his academic studies at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]]  at [[Harvard University]], graduating in 1991 with a master's degree in Public Administration. During his studies at Harvard, Figueres also attended courses at Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School.

==Business career==
Upon returning to Costa Rica after concluding his studies at West Point, he joined and later led the restructuring process of the deeply indebted family business, Sociedad Agroindustrial San Cristobal (SAISC) .{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Figueres helped return the business to profitability by disposing of non-productive assets, reducing leverage, improving the efficiency of many industrial processes, and focusing on expanding exports.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Years later, in 1990, Figueres co-founded Energía Global Inc. a renewable energy company with operations in Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Chile. The business was later sold and today it continues to operate as a subsidiary of ENEL, Italy's largest power company .{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In 1999, Figueres joined the Board of Directors of [[Terremark]] Worldwide Inc., on which he served for five years. He then continued to be closely associated with the company in its international expansion projects. Terremark is involved in transforming and securing enterprise-class IT on a global scale, providing industry managed services, cloud computing, colocation and web hosting solutions for enterprise IT infrastructures from their data centers. In 2011, Terremark was acquired by Verizon.

In 2005, Figueres undertook a one-year assignment as Managing Director of Talal Abu-Ghazaleh Organization, responsible for refocusing global consulting within the group. This group is the largest Arab group of professional services firms, headquartered in Amman, Jordan, with over 73 offices in 23 countries. From 2006 to 2009, Figueres served on the International Advisory Board of Abraaj Capital, the largest Middle East Private Equity firm with over $6 billion of assets under management. In 2009, he joined the Advisory Board of Grupo Arcano, an independent financial services firm based in Madrid, Spain. The group is a leading boutique in investment banking and asset management services .{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In 2010, Figueres joined IJ Partners in Geneva, Switzerland, as a Managing Partner. IJ Partners was founded in 2009 during the global economic crisis, to provide financial services to private individuals and family offices investing exclusively in tangible assets.

Figueres serves on the board of the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]], including as Chair until 2017.

==Political career==
In 1986 [[List of Nobel Peace Prize laureates|Nobel Peace Prize Laurate]] and President [[Óscar Arias]] (1986–1990), appointed Figueres to overhaul the ailing National Railway System, INCOFER. He was then appointed Minister in the Arias government, first of Foreign Trade and later of Agriculture.  Upon the completion of the governmental period Figueres continued his academic studies at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]], graduating in 1991 with a master's degree in Public Administration.

Following his graduate studies at Harvard,  Figueres returned to Costa Rica and declared his intention to seek the nomination of the political party he belonged to, [[Partido Liberación Nacional]]. After a heated and much-disputed primary election process involving five candidates, Figueres won the party's nomination in 1993 and went on to the national election that he won in February 1994. José María Figueres Olsen was elected President of [[Costa Rica]] for four years at the age of 39, the nation's youngest president in the 20th century.

===Presidency===
According to Leonardo Garnier, minister of Planning and Economic Policy during the Figueres' administration, the latter promoted [[Sustainable Development]] as the integrating architecture of governmental action. This program was anchored on three pillars: Firstly, to transform the Costa Rican economy towards one of higher productivity, with special emphasis on technology. Secondly, for the Costa Rican society to express greater solidarity by opening opportunities of wellbeing for all. Thirdly, for society to develop itself in harmony with nature [http://www.josemariafigueres.org/pensamiento/pensamiento.htm] (from the book "Gobernando en Tiempos de Cambio: Administración Figueres Olsen", by Leonardo Garnier). The administration is credited with having worked to advance and promote further integration of Costa Rica into the globalised economy.

===Government achievements===
Figueres reformed and reorganized many public institutions including the closing of some of them, such as Banco Anglo Costarricense (which was plagued with corruption charges) and the National Railway System (INCOFER) which after being re-organized several times was again insolvent. The latter decision was reversed by the following administrations, which actually invested in modernizing the railway, with apparent success [http://crtrenes.blogspot.com/2009/04/incofer-contrata-mas-personal-para.html Trenes en Costa Rica (In Spanish)]. The Figueres Administration contributed to the establishment of [[Intel]] Corporation in Costa Rica.[http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp-.harvard.edu/b02/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=705S08]

His administration also launched several initiatives to improve national education, including a constitutional reform approved by Congress to dedicate 6% of GDP towards public education [http://www.asamblea.go.cr/proyecto/constitu/const7.htm]; introduced English as a second language in public schools from the first grade up; consolidated the installation of computer labs in high schools.

During his term, government created the EBAIS (Primary Teams of Basic Health Care) as an effective provider of preventive medicine in the communities, primarily by giving easy access to medical services.

===Criticisms of government work===
President Figueres' Government was controversial to some. The most common criticisms were :{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* Relinquished the social democratic values of his political party in favor of more economically liberal policies.
* Closed the oldest state owned bank, Banco Anglo Costarricense, and opened up the checking account monopoly held by state owned banks since 1948.
* Shut down the National Railway System, and reformed many other government institutions creating job losses.
* Reformed the special pension fund belonging to teachers, causing the longest teacher strike in Costa Rican history.
* Foreign Policy pursued a strong alignment with Central America as an integral part of a greater openness to the world economy.

==Allegations==

===Chemise case===
In 1991, when Figueres was seen as a possible contender for the presidency, brothers David and José Romero published a book accusing Figueres of having participated in the extrajudicial execution of a drug dealer named Jose Joaquin Orozco, known as "Chemise".&lt;ref&gt;David Romero and José Romero, ''El caso Chemise'', D. Mora, San José, Costa Rica (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for this allegation dated back to March 7, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2002/1/17/EDITORIALES/edito5.html Article by journalist Laffitte Fernández (in Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt; Figueres accused the Romero brothers of [[libel]] and in 1993 a court acquitted them while condemning their main source, former drug-enforcement officer Walter Campos. In 1998 another court sentenced the Romero brothers to seven years' imprisonment for making a false accusation, but that sentence was appealed and revoked due to procedural issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://200.91.68.20/scij/busqueda/jurisprudencia/jur_repartidor.asp?param1=XYZ&amp;nValor1=1&amp;nValor2=128955&amp;strTipM=T&amp;strDirSel=directo Court of Appeals ruling (Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, two years after Figueres left office, the legal proceeding ended with a settlement between the Romero brothers and Figueres's lawyers .{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Religion===
In the middle of Figueres' presidential campaign, anonymous allegations arguing Figueres was not Catholic were widely spread and picked up by the media. Costa Rica's political constitution establishes the Catholic faith as the official State religion [http://www.asamblea.go.cr/proyecto/constitu/const7.htm]. To dispel the strong rumors Monsenor Román Arrieta, Archbishop of San José and President of the Episcopal Conference [http://www.iglesiacr.org/index.php] was obliged to pronounce himself acknowledging José María Figueres had been baptized a Roman Catholic.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Alcatel===
In 2004, Costa Rica's Attorney General opened official investigations against two other former presidents, for alleged financial misconduct. Both were placed under arrest. Shortly afterwards local media reports claimed Figueres had also received payments from [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]].[http://www.teletica.com/archivo/tn7/nac/especial/figueres.htm][https://web.archive.org/web/20090517034449/http://www.ticotimes.net/dailyarchive/2005_01/daily_01_31_05.htm#story1] It was reported that Figueres had earned nearly US $900 thousand for three years of consultancy work on telecommunications with Alcatel initiated two years after his presidency, and while already working in Europe. Figueres disclosed all his financial affairs and requested the Costa Rican Internal Revenue Service to review his tax returns. Following this review, Figueres amended his tax filings to include income earned outside of Costa Rica, which is not subject to Costa Rican tax, and paid 67.2 million Costa Rican colones in taxes. On 5 December 2005 the Internal Revenue Service of Costa Rica notified Figueres of no financial misconduct with resolution number 5452000009594 dated 27 October 2005.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

A Congressional Commission took it upon themselves to investigate the allegations. The Commission of Control of Public Revenue and Expenditure (Comisión de Control del Ingreso y el Gasto Público) summoned Figueres. On 6 September 2005, Judge Maria Morales of the First Circuit Court of Costa Rica pronounced a ruling in Figueres' favour, and against the Congressional Commission's procedures. The Commission also failed to register a report on the findings before the Congress, as stipulated in Congressional Procedural Regulations.

Figueres was never summoned nor charged by the Attorney General's office (fiscalía) [http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2006/junio/06/pais11.html].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ticotimes.net/2015/02/09/ex-president-jose-maria-figueres-olsen-to-head-liberation-party&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 September 2007, the Attorney General formally announced that there were no grounds on which to press any charges against Figueres. [http://www.diarioextra.com/2007/octubre/02/] [https://web.archive.org/web/20071011020517/http://www.diarioextra.com/2007/octubre/02/nacionales01.php].

=== Paradise Papers ===
{{See also|Paradise Papers}}In November 2017 an investigation conducted by the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists|International Consortium of Investigative Journalism]] cited his name in [[List of people and organisations named in the Paradise Papers|the list of politicians named in]] "[[Paradise Papers]]" allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/explore-politicians-paradise-papers/|title=Explore The Politicians in the Paradise Papers - ICIJ|work=ICIJ|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International awards==
President Figueres has received numerous international awards for his work and adherence to the tenets of Sustainable Development. These include:
* Kew Gardens Annual Award, 1995
* Botanic Research Institute Texas, 1996
* State Botanical Garden in Missouri, 1996
* First recipient of the Global Prize from the World Bank's Global Environmental Fund for leadership and efforts for the environment, 1998

* Award of the Climate Institute, Washington D.C., 1998
* [[Order of José Matías Delgado]] Grand Silver Cross from the Republic of El Salvador, 1999

==International leadership==
Upon leaving government in 1998 President Figueres founded Entebbe – [http://www.entebbe.org Fundacion Costa Rica para el Desarollo Sostenible] (Costa Rican Foundation for Sustainable Development). This organization leads and promoted initiatives and projects with national and international impact that encourage the incorporation and use of modern technologies to improve the quality of life in Latin American societies. The foundation started and developed pioneering programs, such as LINCOS (Little Intelligent Communities), APVE (Clean Transport Alternatives) and CENTAIRE (Center for monitoring and evaluation of Air Quality in Central America). A large number of academic, social and communal organizations, as well as private sector partners contributed to the development of these programs.
In the same field of deploying technologies to boost development, together with Nicolas Negroponte and Jeffrey Sachs, Figueres founded the "Digital Nations Consortium", a program overseen by the Media Lab at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).
In 1999 he was called upon by Secretary-General Kofi Annan of the United Nations to chair a working group on Information, Communication, Technology (ICT). He was later elected Chairman of the [http://www.unicttaskforce.org/ United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force (ICT)].

While leading the ICT Task Force, in mid-2000 Figueres was appointed Managing Director of the [[World Economic Forum]], and independent international organization dedicated to improving the state of the world by bringing together world leaders to establish alliances that can influence industry, regional and global agendas. Three years later he was appointed the first CEO of the World Economic Forum.  His responsibilities included coordinating the prestigious annual meeting of the Forum in [[Davos]], Switzerland, which brings together prominent corporate leaders, heads of State and government, as well as respected personalities from the academic, cultural and religious world. Among his achievements while at the Forum was the strengthening of bonds between the corporate world and governmental and social sectors in order to identify their common long term interests and visions.

Figueres resigned from the World Economic Forum towards the end of 2004, when consulting work with Alcatel appeared in the international media. Andre Schneider, the World Economic Forum's spokesman said that Figueres acknowledged violating the rules of the forum by not declaring that he was being retained as a consultant when he took the post and while he was working at the forum. In his letter of resignation, Figueres apologized to forum founder Klaus Schwab for failing to inform the organization that he had entered the consultancy "many months before joining the Forum." [http://insidecostarica.com/dailynews/2004/october/30/nac1.htm Figueres Resigns as Head of World Economic Forum]. In March 2005, Figueres joined the Felipe IV Group (immediately afterward transformed into Concordia 21), in [[Madrid]], Spain as its [[CEO]]. This organization supports and collaborates with institutions working in the fields of Development, Dialogue, and Democracy around the world.

At the same time and since having left government in Costa Rica, Figueres has served on numerous other Boards. He was Chairman of LEAD as well as FUNDES Internacional. He has also served as a director of the, [[World Wildlife Fund]], the Botanic Research Institute Texas, the [[World Resources Institute]] (WRI), and the [[Stockholm Environment Institute]].

Since 2008, Figueres has served as Chairman of the Global Fairness Initiative, taking on the role from its Founding Chairman, President Bill Clinton. He is currently a Board member of FRIDE, the Geneva Earth Council, [[Population Action International]], and is Chairman of the Board of Trustees of [[DARA (international organization)]].

From 2009 until 2011, when its mandate was completed, Figueres served on UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's Advisory Group on Climate Change and Energy.

In 2010, Figueres joined the Carbon War Room as its first Chairman. The organization was founded by Sir Richard Branson and a group of global entrepreneurs. The Carbon War Room is an independent non-profit focused on finding market based solutions to reduce carbon emissions at the gigaton scale, either by creating new business models or identifying policy reforms.
In the academic field, Figueres serves on the Dean's Alumni Leadership Council at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and he is a fellow of Thunderbird School of Global Management, where he often participates in global business events.

Figueres is a founding member of the [[Club de Madrid]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clubmadrid.org/en/estructura/former_heads_of_state_and_government_1/letra:f&lt;/ref&gt; an independent non-profit organization composed of more than 100 democratic former Presidents and Prime Ministers from all over the world. The Club de Madrid's objective is to promote "Democracy that Delivers".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7851">The '''Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida''', often referred to as the '''Florida Territorial Council''' or ''' Florida Territorial Legislative Council''', was the legislative body governing the American territory of [[Florida]] ([[Florida Territory]]) before statehood. The territory of Florida was acquired by the U.S. in 1821 under the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]]. Replacing the form of [[martial law]] that had existed in the territory since Florida was acquired, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] in 1822 established a territorial government consisting of a governor, secretary, thirteen-member Legislative Council, and judiciary, all of whom were appointed by the [[President of the United States|U.S. president]].&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|3|637}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|3|654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress changed the Legislative Council's structure many times in the 1820s and 1830s, gradually granting the territory more autonomy. Beginning in 1826, Council members were popularly elected rather than appointed by the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|4|146}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838, the Council became [[bicameral]] and was divided into a Senate and House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|5|263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council was superseded by the [[Florida Legislature|General Assembly of the State of Florida]] after statehood was granted 1845.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/serial?id=flterrlegis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.law.fsu.edu/crc/conhist/1838con.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301115023/http://archive.law.fsu.edu/crc/conhist/1838con.html |archivedate=2016-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital==
The Council determined to rotate between the historical capitals of [[Pensacola, Florida]] and [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. The first legislative session was held at Pensacola on July 22, 1822; this required delegates from St. Augustine to travel 59 days by sea to attend. To get to the second session in St. Augustine, Pensacola members traveled 28 days over land. During this session, the council decided future meetings should be held at a half-way point to reduce the distance; eventually [[History of Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], site of successive Indian settlements until burned by [[Seminole Wars#East Florida (east side of Apalachicola River)|Andrew Jackson]], was selected as a half-way point between the former capitals of East and West Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Florida: A Short History, Michael V. Gannon, {{ISBN|0-8130-1167-1}}, Copyright @ 1993 by the Board of Regents of the State of Florida&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[William H. Simmons]] and [[John Lee Williams]] of Pensacola were commissioned by the second Florida Territorial Council to select a central point between St. Augustine and Pensacola to serve as capital of the Florida Territory in 1823.&lt;ref name="Hare2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julianne Hare|title=Tallahassee: A Capital City History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6s-hd6lBiQC&amp;pg=PA26|year=2002|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-2371-2|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Florida Territorial Council]] commissioned John Bellamy, a [[Monticello, Florida]] [[Planter (American South)|planter]], to build [[Bellamy Road]].

==Significant acts==
One of the requirements for a [[United States territory]] to become a State of the Union is that its constitution be approved by the [[United States Congress]]. In order to fulfill that requirement, an Act was passed by the Florida Territorial Council in 1838, approved by Governor [[Richard Keith Call]], calling for the election of [[delegates]] in October 1838 to a [[Political convention|convention]] to be held at [[St. Joseph, Gulf County, Florida|St. Joseph, Florida]]. The delegates were to draft a constitution and [[bill of rights]] for the Territory of Florida. The Constitutional Convention convened on December 3, 1838 with [[Robert R. Reid]] presiding as president and [[Joshua Knowles]] secretary. The work of the Convention was carried out by eighteen committees, whose members were familiar with that particular area of government. The process was a relatively simple one, since they used the constitutions of several other Southern states as models. Only on the subject of banking did much debate take place. The Convention adjourned ''[[sine die]]'' on January 11, 1839.

Jackson County was created by the Florida Territorial Council in 1822 out of [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia County]], along with [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]] out of [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. Johns County]], making them the third and fourth counties in the Territory. The county was named for [[Andrew Jackson]], who had served as Florida's first military governor for six months in 1821. Jackson County originally extended from the [[Choctawhatchee River]] on the west to the [[Suwannee River]] on the east. The county had been reduced close to its present boundaries by 1840 through the creation of new counties from its original territory. Minor adjustments to the county boundaries continued through most of the 19th century, however.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jackson.county-florida.com/ Jackson County Information] - accessed February 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ap.grolier.com/article?assetid=0219960-00 Encyclopedia Americana - Jackson, Andrew] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210164843/http://ap.grolier.com/article?assetid=0219960-00 |date=2008-02-10 }} - accessed February 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fernald, Edward A. (1981) ''Atlas of Florida.'' The Florida State University Foundation, Inc. {{ISBN|0-9606708-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
[[Richard Keith Call]], [[Davis Floyd]], [[Charles W. Downing, Jr.]], [[Thomas Baltzell]], [[Joseph B. Lancaster]], [[William A. Forward]] and [[David Yulee]] were among those who participated in the Council.

[[Zephaniah Kingsley]], a plantation owner, slave trader, and merchant who had polygamous "marriages" with four purchased slave women he had emancipated, served a single term and did not run when the Council became elective in 1826. During his time as a Council member, he advocated for the Spanish system of slavery that provided for certain rights to free people of color. Kingsley attempted to influence Florida lawmakers to recognize free people of color and allow mixed-race children to inherit property. Kingsley objected to the law passed by the Council that prohibited mixed-race children from inheriting property. The territory did not recognize [[interracial marriage]] or [[polygamous marriage]]s as legal. The year following Kingsley's death, his sister Martha and her children contested his will as "defective and invalid".&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Kingsley's sister cited Florida law that forbade black people from owning property, and claimed that Anna and Kingsley's other wives had moved to Haiti spontaneously, abandoning the property in Florida to become free people. Anna returned to Florida in 1846 to participate in the Kingsley estate defense, despite the increasingly tense racial climate in [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]].&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The court upheld the treaty signed between the U.S. and Spain, stipulating that all free blacks born before 1822 in Florida enjoyed the same legal privileges as they had when Spain controlled East Florida. Anna furthermore asked for, and was granted, the transfer of ownership of slaves who had been sent to the San Jose plantation when the family had moved to Haiti.  Her request to rent slaves to other plantations to maximize her profits was rejected by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Scahfer, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=February 2009}}
The '''Royal Mencap Society''' is a [[charitable organization|charity]] based in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] that works with people with a [[Mental retardation|learning disability]].

==Profile==
Mencap is the UK's leading [[learning disability]] charity working with people with a learning disability and their families and carers. Mencap works collaboratively, fighting for equal rights, campaigning for greater opportunities and challenging attitudes and prejudice.

Mencap also provides help and support through supported living, supported employment, respite services, organised activities, systemic and individual advocacy, and outreach support.

Mencap provides advice and support to meet people's needs throughout their lives, as an individual membership organisation with a local network of more than 450 affiliated groups. Mencap's work is membership-driven, and thanks to its work for the welfare of young people, it is a member of [[NCVYS|The National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS)]].&lt;ref name="NCVYS members"&gt;[http://www.ncvys.org.uk/index.php?page=392 Full list of NCVYS members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512231646/http://www.ncvys.org.uk/index.php?page=392 |date=2013-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coalitions===
Mencap, along with 14 other organisations, is a member of the [[Learning Disability Coalition]].  The Coalition was formed in May 2007 to campaign for better funding for social care for people with a learning disability in England.

Mencap partnered with [[ENABLE Scotland]] in a special 'sister charity' relationship to help support people with learning disabilities in Scotland.

==Management==
Since 1998, at least one-third of the members of the National Assembly must be people with a learning disability.

From 1980 the actor [[Brian Rix, Baron Rix|Brian Rix]] represented the charity in a number of positions, including [[Secretary-General]], [[Chairman]] and finally [[President]].  The chief executive of Mencap is [[Jan Tregelles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease | url = http://www.mencap.org.uk/news/article/mencap-announces-new-chief-executive-0 | title = Mencap announces new chief executive | publisher = Mencap | date = 2013-03-26 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714203506/http://www.mencap.org.uk/news/article/mencap-announces-new-chief-executive-0 | archivedate = 2014-07-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; succeeding [[Mark Goldring]] in March 2013. Jan first worked at Mencap in 1983 as PA to one of the then directors. Jan has held various posts across Mencap; she has been the director of personal support since 2002 and has grown the business from £80 million turnover to £180 million in that time.

==History==
Established by [[Judy Fryd]] in 1946 as '''The National Association of Parents of Backwards Children''', the organisation changed its name to '''The National Society for Mentally Handicapped Children''' in 1955, becoming '''The Royal Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and Adults''' following [[patronage]] from [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] and [[Elizabeth II]] in 1981. 

Fryd had written to ''Nursery World'' magazine inviting other parents to contact her. Many wrote back expressing their anger and sorrow at the lack of services for their children.

Since 1969 the Society has been commonly known by the abbreviation "Mencap" (presumably from '''''Men'''tally Handi'''cap'''ped'') and, in 2002, its full legal name was shortened to the Royal Mencap Society. 

In 1955, the Society opened its first project, the Orchard Dene short-stay residential home. In 1958, it launched a ground-breaking project called the Brooklands Experiment. This compared the progress of children with a learning disability who lived in hospital with a group of children who were moved to a small family environment and cared for using educational activities modelled on those in "ordinary" nurseries. After two years, the children in the home-like environment showed marked improvements in social, emotional and verbal skills. The success of the experiment was published around the world.

== Supporters and ambassadors ==
In 1986, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] became the patron of Mencap and in 2004 the [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex|Countess of Wessex]] became Mencap's patron.

The charity has several notable supporters such as [[The Edge]], [[Jo Whiley]], [[Kit Harington]], [[Jodie Whittaker]], [[Mat Horne]], [[Sarah Gordy]]. 

Additionally, [[Duran Duran]], [[Christopher Eccleston]], [[Norman Wisdom]], [[Bruce Barrymore Halpenny]], [[Joanne Salley]], [[Jonny Lee Miller]] and [[Snow Patrol]] have all also supported the charity. Another notable fundraiser and supporter is [[Norma Major|Dame Norma Major]], wife of former prime minister [[John Major|Sir John Major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/06/99/queens_birthday_honours/366850.stm|accessdate=16 July 2010|title=Norma Major honoured for fundraising|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=12 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry''' or '''Board of Rites''' was one of the [[Six Ministries]] of government in late [[imperial China]]. It existed from the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (7th century) until the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]]. Along with religious rituals and court ceremonial, the Ministry of Rites also oversaw the [[imperial examination]] and China's foreign relations.

==History==
Under the [[Han dynasty|Han]], similar functions were performed by the [[Ministry of Ceremonies (China)|Ministry of Ceremonies]]. In early medieval China, its functions were performed by other officials including the Grand Herald. Under the [[Song dynasty|Song]] (10th-13th centuries), its functions were temporarily transferred to the [[Zhongshu Sheng]]. Its administration of China's foreign relations was ended by the establishment of the [[Zongli Yamen]] in 1861.

==Functions==
*Management of imperial court ceremonies and [[ritual offerings]].
*Registration and supervision of [[Buddhist]] and [[Taoist]] priests within China.
*Management of the [[Imperial examinations]].
*Foreign relations.

[[File:Lilburn-Boggs.jpg|thumb|[[Lilburn Boggs]], who issued Missouri Executive Order 44]]
'''Missouri Executive Order 44''', also known as the '''Extermination Order''',&lt;ref name=DeVoto2000p84-85&gt;{{harvnb|DeVoto|2000|pp=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G1839"&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1839|pp=8, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[executive order]] issued on October 27, 1838, by the [[Governor of Missouri]], [[Lilburn Boggs]].  The order was issued in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Crooked River]], a clash between members of The Church of Jesus Christ of [[Latter-day Saints]] (known as [[Mormons]]) and a unit of the [[Missouri Volunteer Militia|Missouri State Militia]] in northern [[Ray County, Missouri]], during the [[1838 Mormon War]]. Claiming that the church members had committed open and avowed defiance of the law and had made war upon the people of [[Missouri]], Governor Boggs directed that "the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State if necessary for the public peace—their outrages are beyond all description".&lt;ref name=G1839/&gt;  The militia and other state authorities—General [[John Bullock Clark|John B. Clark]], among them—used the executive order to violently expel the Mormons from their lands in the state following their capitulation, which in turn led to their subsequent migration to [[Nauvoo, Illinois]]. The order was supported by most northwest Missouri citizens but was questioned or denounced by others. However, no determination of the order's legality was ever made. On June 25, 1976, Governor [[Kit Bond]] issued an executive order rescinding the Extermination Order, recognizing its legal invalidity and formally apologizing on behalf of the State of Missouri for the suffering it had caused the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sos.mo.gov/cmsimages/archives/resources/findingaids/miscMormRecs/eo/19760625_RescisOrder.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of the order==
[[File:Extermination order.gif|thumb|The original handwritten order]]
Missouri Executive Order Number 44, read as follows:

{{quote|
Headquarters of the Militia,

City of Jefferson, Oct. 27, 1838.

Gen. John B. Clark:

Sir: Since the order of this morning to you, directing you to cause four hundred mounted men to be raised within your division, I have received by Amos Reese, Esq., of Ray county, and Wiley C. Williams, Esq., one of my aids{{sic}}, information of the most appalling character, which entirely changes the face of things, and places the Mormons in the attitude of an open and avowed defiance of the laws, and of having made war upon the people of this state. Your orders are, therefore, to hasten your operation with all possible speed. The Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the state if necessary for the public peace—their outrages are beyond all description. If you can increase your force, you are authorized to do so to any extent you may consider necessary. I have just issued orders to Maj. Gen. Willock, of Marion county, to raise five hundred men, and to march them to the northern part of Daviess, and there unite with Gen. Doniphan, of Clay, who has been ordered with five hundred men to proceed to the same point for the purpose of intercepting the retreat of the Mormons to the north. They have been directed to communicate with you by express, you can also communicate with them if you find it necessary. Instead therefore of proceeding as at first directed to reinstate the citizens of Daviess in their homes, you will proceed immediately to Richmond and then operate against the Mormons. Brig. Gen. Parks of Ray, has been ordered to have four hundred of his brigade in readiness to join you at Richmond. The whole force will be placed under your command.

I am very respectfully,

yr obt st [your obedient servant],

L. W. Boggs,

Commander-in-Chief.&lt;ref name="G1839"/&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Mormon War (1838)}}
Executive Order 44 was issued during the [[1838 Mormon War]], which was caused by friction between the Mormons and their neighbors due to the economic and electoral growth of the Latter-day Saint community and [[Joseph Smith]]'s vocal [[Abolitionism in the United States|opposition to slavery]].&lt;ref name=DeVoto2000p84-85 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|LeSueur|1987|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the religious and political views of the Mormons did not sit well with the non-Mormon citizens of the state.  Tensions had been steadily rising due to 1833 newspaper articles written in Independence, Missouri, which culminated in a manifesto published by many  Missouri public officials.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;We, the undersigned, citizens Jackson County, believing that an important crisis is at hand, as regards our civil society, in consequence of a pretended religious sect of people that have settled, and are still settling in our County, styling themselves Mormons; and intending, as we do, to rid our society, "peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must," and believing as we do, that the arm of the civil law does not afford us a guarantee, or at least a sufficient one against the evils which are now inflicted upon us, and seem to be increasing, by the said religious sect, deem it expedient, and of the highest importance, to form ourselves into a company for the better and easier accomplishment of our purpose—a purpose which we deem it almost superfluous to say, is justified as well by the law of nature, as by the law of self-preservation.

It is more than two years since the first of these fanatics, or knaves, (for one or the other they undoubtedly are) made their first appearance among us, and pretended as they did, and now do, to hold personal communication and converse face-to-face with the Most High God; to receive communications and revelations direct from heaven; to heal the sick by laying on hands; and, in short, to perform all the wonder-working miracles wrought by the inspired Apostles and Prophets of old.

We believed them deluded fanatics, or weak and designing knaves, and that they and their pretensions would soon pass away; but in this we were deceived. The arts of a few designing leaders amongst them have thus far succeeded in holding to them together as a society; and since the arrival of the first of them, they have been daily increasing in numbers; and if they had been respectable citizens in society and thus deluded they would have been entitled to our pity rather than to our contempt and hatred; but from their appearance, from their manners, and from their conduct since their coming among us, we have every reason to fear that, with but very few exceptions, they were of the very dregs of that society from which they came, lazy, idle, and vicious. This we can see it is not idle assertion, they fact susceptible of proof, or with these few exceptions above-named, they brought into our country little or no property with them and left less behind them, and we infer that those only yoked themselves to the "Mormon" car who had nothing earthly or heavenly to lose by the monad; and we fear that if some of the leaders amongst them, had paid the forfeit due to crime, instead of being chosen ambassadors of the Most High, they would have been inmates of solitary cells. But their conduct here stamps their characters in their true colors. More than a year since, it was ascertained that they had been tampering with our slaves, and endeavoring to sow dissensions and raise seditions amongst them. Of this their "Mormon" leaders were informed, and they said they would deal with any of their members who should again in like case offend. But how spacious are appearances. In a late number of the Star, published in Independence by the leaders of the sect, there is an article inviting free Negroes and mulattoes from other states to become "Mormons," and remove and settle among us. This exhibits them in still more odious colors. It manifests a desire on the part of their society, to inflict on our society an injury that they know would be to us entirely insupportable, and one of the surest means of driving us from the country; for it would require none of the supernatural gifts that they pretend to, to see that the introduction of such a caste among us would corrupt our blacks, and instigate them to bloodshed.

They openly blaspheme the Most High God, and cast contempt on His holy religion, by pretending to receive revelations direct from heaven, by pretending to speak unknown tongues, by direct inspiration, and by diverse pretenses derogatory to God and religion, and to the utter subversion of human reason.

They declare openly that their God hath given them this county of land, and that sooner or later they must and will have possession of our lands for inheritance; and, in fine, they have conducted themselves on many other occasions, and such a manner, that we believe it a duty we owe to ourselves, our wives, and children, to the cause of public morals, to remove them from among us, as we are not prepared to give up our pleasant places and goodly possessions to them or to receive into the bosom of our families, as fit companions for wives and daughters, the degraded and corrupted free Negroes and mulattos that are now invited to settle among us.

Under such a state of things, even our beautiful county would cease to be a desirable residence, and our situation intolerable! We, therefore agree (that after timely warning, and receiving an adequate compensation for what little property they cannot take with them, they refuse to leave us in peace, as they found us—we agree to use such means as may be sufficient to remove them, and to that and we each pledge to each other our bodily powers, our lives, fortunes and sacred honors.

We will meet at the courthouse, at the town of Independence, on Saturday next, the 20th inst., [July], to consult on subsequent movements.

Samuel C. Owens, County Clerk
Russel Hicks, Deputy County Clerk
R.W. Cummins, Indian agent
James H. Flournoy, Postmaster
S.D. Lucas, Colonel and judge of the court
Henry Chiles, attorney-at-law
N.K. Olmstead, M.D.
John Smith, justice in peace
Samuel Westin, justice of the peace

Abner F. Staples, Captain
Thomas Pitcher, Deputy Constable
Moses G. Wilson and Thomas Wilson, merchants&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith, [[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]|1833, vol. 1, pp. 374–376&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the same day, July 20, 1833, the [[W.W. Phelps]] printing press, which published The Evening and the Morning Star in Independence, was destroyed by a mob.

The destruction was also in retaliation for the publication of portions of the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]], particularly that of the book of Genesis, in a Mormon newspaper The Evening and the Morning Star in August 1832 and in March and April 1833.

Early July 1833, the Star announced: "At no very distant period, we shall print the book of Mormon and the [New] Testament, and bind them in one volume." However, hopes for this were postponed when the printing press in Independence was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Church History, 2:3&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1838 Mormon War ended with the expulsion of nearly all Latter-day Saints from the state of Missouri.&lt;ref name=Hartley&gt;{{harvnb|Hartley|2001|pp=6, 20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|1994|pp=27–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive Order 44 is often referred to as the "Extermination Order" due to the phrasing used by Governor Boggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Missouri Mormon War Executive Orders|url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/resources/findingaids/miscmormonrecords.asp?rec=eo|website=http://www.sos.mo.gov|publisher=Missouri Secretary of State|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latter-day Saints had been given a county of their own ([[Caldwell County, Missouri|Caldwell County]]) in 1836, following their expulsion from [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] in 1833.  However, the increasing influx of new church converts moving to northwestern Missouri led them to begin settling in adjacent counties.  Other settlers, who had operated under the assumption that the Latter-day Saints would remain confined to [[Caldwell County, Missouri|Caldwell County]], became angry due to these new settlements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansasboguslegislature.org/mo/doniphan_a_w.html Alexander W. Doniphan], quote.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 1838, church leader [[Sidney Rigdon]] delivered an oration in [[Far West, Missouri|Far West]], the county seat of Caldwell County.  While not desiring or intending to start any trouble with his non-church neighbors, Rigdon wanted to make clear that the Latter-day Saints would meet any attacks on them—such as had already occurred in Jackson County during the summer and fall of 1833, resulting in their forced expulsion from their homes in that locale—with force:

{{quote|We take God and all the holy angels to witness this day, that we warn all men in the name of Jesus Christ, to come on us no more forever. For from this hour, we will bear it no more, our rights shall no more be trampled on with impunity. The man or the set of men, who attempts it, does it at the expense of their lives. And that mob that comes on us to disturb us; it shall be between us and them a war of extermination; for we will follow them till the last drop of their blood is spilled, or else they will have to exterminate us: for we will carry the seat of war to their own houses, and their own families, and one party or the other shall be utterly destroyed.—Remember it then all MEN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Oration_Delivered_by_Mr._S._Rigdon_on_the_4th_of_July_at_Far_West,_Caldwell_County,_Missouri|title=Oration Delivered by Mr. S. Rigdon on the 4th of July at Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|last=Rigdon|first=Sidney}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Far from settling tensions, Rigdon's oration had the opposite effect: it terrified and inflamed the residents of surrounding counties.  By the Fall of that same year these tensions escalated into open conflict, culminating in the looting and burning of several Latter-day Saint farms and homes, the sacking and burning of [[Gallatin, Missouri|Gallatin]] by the "[[Danites]]", and the taking of hostages by Cpt. [[Samuel Bogart]] and his militia, operating in northern Ray County (to the south of Caldwell).  When the Latter-day Saint militia from the town of [[Far West, Missouri|Far West]] moved south to the militia camp on the [[Crooked River (Missouri)|Crooked River]], causing rumors of a planned full-scale invasion of Missouri that ran rampant throughout the summer and aroused terror throughout the western part of the state.  These rumors only increased as reports of the [[Battle of Crooked River]] reached the capital at [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]], with accounts of Latter-day Saints allegedly slaughtering Bogart's militia company, including those who had surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|LeSueur|1987|pp=143–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further dispatches spoke of an impending attacks on [[Richmond, Missouri|Richmond]], county seat of [[Ray County, Missouri|Ray County]], though in fact no such attack was ever contemplated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|LeSueur|1987|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After hearing these reports Governor Boggs chose to act.

Previously, Governor Boggs had received word that Latter-day Saints had driven several citizens of Daviess County (north of Caldwell) from their homes.  He had then appointed General [[John Bullock Clark]] to lead the state militia in assisting those citizens to return.  But after hearing these reports, Governor Boggs issued new orders directing Clark to commence direct military operations and issued Missouri Executive Order 44&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|Leonard|1992|pp=136–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quinn|1994|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Office of the Secretary of State of Missouri|1841|pp=50–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deaths==
While the church never made a full accounting of their casualties, their various reports listed rape, gunshot wounds, beatings and exposure. Persecutions against members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the 19th century were often violent, vicious, and cruel. Many were murdered and hundreds of surviving refugees died fleeing their persecutors during the Missouri War.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

General Clark cited Executive Order 44 soon after the Latter-day Saints surrendered in November 1838, saying that violence would have been used had they chosen not to surrender.&lt;ref name = Linn&gt;{{harvnb|Linn|2010|pp=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clark furthermore stated, 

{{quote|I do not say you shall go now, but you must not think of staying here another season, or of putting in crops, for the moment you do this, the citizens will be upon you; and if I am called here again, in a case of a non-compliance of a treaty made, do not think I will do as I have now.  You need not expect any mercy, but extermination, for I am determined the governor's orders be executed.  As for your leaders, do not think, do not imagine for a moment, do not let it enter into your mind, that they will be delivered and restored to you again, for their fate is fixed, their die is cast, their doom is sealed.}}  

The Latter-day Saints had every reason to trust this threat, considering recent activities involving other members of the state militia. Therefore, 15,000 Mormons consisting of men, women and children fled for Illinois immediately in harsh winter conditions.  Even still, the question of whether anyone was killed as a direct result of the Extermination Order between October 27 (the date of its issuance) and November 1, 1838 (the date of the Latter-day Saint surrender), has been hotly debated among members of the Church and historians.  Most historians state that there is no evidence of any militiamen or other participants using it to justify their behavior during that period.&lt;ref name = LeSueur163&gt;{{harvnb|LeSueur|1987|pp=163–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haun's Mill===
{{main|Haun's Mill massacre}}
[[File:Haun's Mill by C.C.A. Christensen.png|thumb|"Haun's Mill" by [[C. C. A. Christensen]]]]
Many people connect Governor Boggs' order directly to the [[Haun's Mill massacre]].  At least one firsthand account asserts local Guardsmen referred to an order issued by the governor that sounds similar to Order 44 as justification for the Haun's Mill massacre.  The Haun's Mill massacre was launched by Missouri State Guardsmen from [[Livingston County, Missouri|Livingston County]] on the settlement of Haun's Mill, located in eastern Caldwell County near the Livingston County line, which resulted in the deaths of 18 men and boys, some of whom were [[murdered]] after surrendering.&lt;ref name=Tullidge&gt;{{harvnb|Tullidge|1877|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The firsthand account explains soldiers stated the governor had ordered their expulsion or extermination if they did not leave at once.&lt;ref name="Tullidge"/&gt;

{{quote|
"Halt!" commanded the leader of a band of well-mounted and well-armed mobocrats, who charged down upon them as they journeyed on their way.

"If you proceed any farther west," said the captain, "you will be instantly shot."

"Wherefore?" inquired the pilgrims.

"You are d__d Mormons!"

"We are law-abiding Americans, and have given no cause of offence."

"You are d__d Mormons.  That's offence enough.  Within ten days every Mormon must be out of Missouri, or men, women, and children will be shot down indiscriminately.  No mercy will be shown.  It is the order of the Governor that you should all be exterminated; and by G_d you will be."}}

Others state there is no evidence that the militiamen knew of the Executive Order,&lt;ref name=Hartley/&gt;&lt;ref name = LeSueur163/&gt; and participants in this massacre who spoke of it later never used Governor Boggs' decree to justify their actions.&lt;ref name = Hartley/&gt;&lt;ref name = LeSueur163/&gt;  They instead indicate that unnamed church dissenters had told them that the people of Haun's Mill were planning to invade Livingston County.&lt;ref name = Hartley/&gt;&lt;ref name = LeSueur163/&gt;  The question of whether the militiamen knew in advance of Boggs' order is still hotly debated today.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

A little less debatable is the question of the murder of defenseless, unarmed men and boys.&lt;ref name="Tullidge"/&gt; 

{{quote|We arrived in Caldwell county, near Haun's Mill, nine wagons of us in company.  Two days before we arrived we were taken prisoners by an armed mob that had demanded every bit of ammunition and every weapon we had.  We surrendered all.  They knew it, for they searched our wagons.

A few miles more brought us to Haun's Mill, where that awful scene of murder was enacted.  My husband pitched his tent by a blacksmith's shop.

Brother David Evans made a treaty with the mob that they would not molest us.  He came just before the massacre and called the company together and they knelt in prayer.

I sat in my tent.  Looking up I suddenly saw the mob coming—the same that took away our weapons.}}

Aligning with the firsthand statements regarding having been stripped of all weapons prior to the attack is the lack of casualties or injuries inflicted upon the attackers.  In addition, orders explicitly stated the Mormons were to have their weapons removed.

The massacre and Governor Boggs' Executive Order are examples of [[anti-Mormonism|anti-Mormon]] sentiment in the area.

==Financial losses==
To date, financial reparations for the crimes and losses, committed against the Mormons, have yet to come to fruition.

{{quote|What the total of the pecuniary losses of the Mormons in Missouri was cannot be accurately estimated. They asserted that in Jackson County alone, $120,000 worth of their property was destroyed, and that fifteen thousand of their number fled from the state. Smith, in a statement of his losses made after his arrival in Illinois, placed them at $1,000,000. In a memorial presented to Congress at this time the losses in Jackson County were placed at $175,000, and in the state of Missouri at $2,000,000. The efforts of the Mormons to secure redress were long continued. Not only was Congress appealed to, but legislatures of other states were urged to petition in their behalf. The Senate committee at Washington reported that the matter was entirely within the jurisdiction of the state of Missouri. One of the latest appeals was addressed by Smith at Nauvoo in December, 1843, to his native state, Vermont, calling on the Green Mountain boys, not only to assist him in attaining justice in Missouri, but also to humble and chastise or abase her for the disgraces she has brought upon constitutional liberty, until she atones for her sin.&lt;ref name=Linn /&gt;}}

To put the dollar numbers in modern context: $1,000,000 in 1838 equals $25,604,272.41 in 2018.

==Aftermath==
[[File:John Bullock Clark, Senior.jpg|thumb|General [[John Bullock Clark]], to whom Governor Boggs addressed the Order]]
Although the Latter Day Saint leaders surrendered at [[Far West, Missouri|Far West]] on November 1, Latter Day Saints (especially in outlying areas) continued to be subject to harassment and even forced ejection by citizens and renegade militia units.  The Latter Day Saints in Caldwell County, as part of their surrender agreement, sign over all of their property to pay the expenses of the campaign against them; although this act was later held unlawful,&lt;ref name=LeSueur225/&gt; it became clear to them that departure from the state was the only option state officials were going to allow.

Upon his arrival at Far West, General Clark delivered the following speech to the now-captive Latter Day Saints, in which he directly invoked Order 44:

{{quote|...The order of the governor was to me, that you should be exterminated, and not allowed to remain in the state; and had not your leaders been given up, and the terms of this treaty &lt;ref&gt;This refers to an agreement between the Mormons leaders and General Samuel Lucas, signed under duress, which compelled the Mormons to give up their leaders, their arms and all of their lands and property, and to then leave Missouri.  [http://yavanika.org/classes/data/uploads/clarkspeech.pdf General Clark's Speech], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; complied with, your families before this time would have been destroyed, and your houses in ashes.  There is a discretionary power vested in my hands, which concerning your circumstances I will exercise for a season...&lt;ref name=Lin&gt;{{harvnb|Lin|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yavanika.org/classes/data/uploads/clarkspeech.pdf General Clark's Speech], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though Clark had offered to allow the Latter Day Saints to remain in Missouri until the following spring, the Saints decided to leave right away; according to one account, most had departed within ten days of Clark's speech.&lt;ref name=Lin/&gt;  Although Governor Boggs belatedly ordered a militia unit under Colonel [[Sterling Price]] (later to achieve fame as a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[American Civil War|Civil War]] general) to northern Missouri to stop ongoing depredations against the Latter Day Saints, he refused to repeal Order #44.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|LeSueur|1987|pp=232–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Missouri legislature deferred discussion of an appeal by Latter Day Saint leaders to rescind the decree,  Nearly all of the approximately 10,000 Latter Day Saints left Missouri by the spring of 1839.  The Latter Day Saints would not begin to return to Missouri until approximately 25 years later.

Governor Boggs himself was excoriated in certain portions of the Missouri press, as well as those of neighboring states, for his action in issuing this order.&lt;ref name=LeSueur225&gt;{{harvnb|LeSueur|1987|pp=225, 229, 237–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; General [[David Atchison]], a prominent legislator and militia general from western Missouri who had refused to take part in operations, demanded that the Legislature formally state its opinion of Governor Boggs' order, for "he would not live in any state, where such authority was given".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|LeSueur|1987|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although his proposal and similar ones by others went down to defeat, Governor Boggs himself saw his once-promising political career destroyed to the point that, by the next election, his own [[Democratic Party (United States)|party]] was reluctant to be associated with him.&lt;ref name=LeSueur258&gt;{{harvnb|LeSueur|1987|pp=258–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After surviving an assassination attempt in 1842, Governor Boggs ultimately emigrated to California, where he died in relative obscurity in the [[Napa Valley]] in 1860.&lt;ref name=LeSueur258/&gt;

==Rescission==
[[File:Kit Bond official portrait.jpg|thumb|Kit Bond, the governor who rescinded Order 44]]

In late 1975, President Lyman F. Edwards of the [[Far West, Missouri|Far West]] [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]] of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, now known as the [[Community of Christ]], invited then Missouri Governor [[Kit Bond]] to participate in the June 25, 1976, stake's annual conference as a good-will gesture for the [[United States Bicentennial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jwha.info/mmff/exorder.htm |title= The Extermination Order and How it was Rescinded |publisher= [[John Whitmer Historical Association]] |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110526042751/http://www.jwha.info/mmff/exorder.htm |archivedate= May 26, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of his address at that conference, 137 years after being signed and citing the [[unconstitutional]] nature of Governor Boggs' directive, Governor Bond presented the following Executive Order:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Whitman |first= Dale A. |authorlink= Dale A.

{{quote|WHEREAS, on October 27, 1838, the Governor of the State of Missouri, Lilburn W. Boggs, signed an order calling for the extermination or expulsion of Mormons from the State of Missouri; and

WHEREAS, Governor Boggs' order clearly contravened the rights to life, liberty, property and religious freedom as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, as well as the Constitution of the State of Missouri; and

WHEREAS, in this bicentennial year as we reflect on our nation's heritage, the exercise of religious freedom is without question one of the basic tenets of our free democratic republic;

Now, THEREFORE, I, CHRISTOPHER S. BOND, Governor of the State of Missouri, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the State of Missouri, do hereby order as follows:

Expressing on behalf of all Missourians our deep regret for the injustice and undue suffering which was caused by the 1838 order, I hereby rescind Executive Order Number 44, dated October 27, 1838, issued by Governor W. Boggs.

In witness I have hereunto set my hand and caused to be affixed the great seal of the State of Missouri, in the city of Jefferson, on this 25 day of June, 1976.

The '''mitigation of peak oil''' is the attempt to delay the date and minimize the social and economic effects of [[peak oil]] by reducing the [[oil consumption|consumption]] of and [[oil dependence|reliance]] on [[petroleum]]. By reducing petroleum consumption, mitigation efforts seek to favorably change the shape of the [[Hubbert curve]], which is the graph of real oil production over time predicted by [[Hubbert peak theory]].  The peak of this curve is known as peak oil, and by changing the shape of the curve, the timing of the peak in oil production is affected. An analysis by the author of the [[Hirsch report]] showed that while the shape of the oil production curve can be affected by mitigation efforts, mitigation efforts are also affected by the shape of Hubbert curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For the most part, mitigation involves [[energy conservation|fuel conservation]], and the use of [[alternative energy|alternative]] and [[renewable energy]] sources.  The development of [[unconventional oil]] resources can extend the supply of petroleum,&lt;ref name="BartisBoston"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; but does not reduce consumption.

Historically, world oil consumption data show that mitigation efforts during the [[1973 energy crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979 oil shocks]] lowered oil consumption, while general [[recession]]s since the 1970s have had no effect on curbing the oil consumption until 2007.{{citation needed|date = November 2016}} In the United States, oil consumption declines in reaction to high prices.&lt;ref name="Frank Langfitt"&gt;{{cite news

==Alternative energy==
The most effective method of mitigating peak oil is to use [[renewable energy|renewable]] or [[alternative energy]] sources in place of petroleum.

[[Nuclear power]], considered by some to be a viable alternative source, can be substituted for petroleum in some cases.  [[China]] is preparing for the post-peak oil future by building [[pebble bed reactors]] configured to produce [[hydrogen fuel]] from the [[electrolysis of water]].  The use of nuclear power is often a highly contentious issue because of [[peak uranium|questions of the future availability of fuel]] and the dangerous nature of [[nuclear waste]].  Some current research projects are focused on [[Aneutronic fusion|neutron-free fusion power]], in which [[hydrogen]] and [[boron]] are heated to over 1 billion degrees,&lt;ref&gt;

==Transportation fuel use==
Because most oil is consumed for [[transportation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/figure_33.html EIA - International Energy Outlook 2007 - Figure 33&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; most mitigation discussions revolve around transportation issues.

===Fuel substitution===
{{Main|Future energy development}}
While there is some interchangeability, the alternative energy sources available tend to depend on whether the fuel is being used in static or mobile applications.

====Biofuel====
{{Main|Biofuel}}
The use of biofuels, which are [[fuel]]s derived from recently dead [[biotic material|biological material]], reduces dependence on petroleum and enhances [[Energy security and renewable technology|energy security]].  Biofuels also play significant roles in the "[[food vs fuel]]" debate, mitigation of [[oil prices]], and energy balance and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/smartway/growandgo/documents/faq.htm#i_05 |title= SmartWay Grow &amp; Go }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ethanol]] is a biofuel produced from crops high in sugar (e.g., [[sugar cane]], [[sweet sorghum]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energycurrent.com/?id=3&amp;storyid=10539 ICRISAT: Sweet sorghum balances food and fuel needs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104190936/http://www.energycurrent.com/?id=3&amp;storyid=10539 |date=2009-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[starch]], (corn/[[maize]]).  Biofuels can also be produced from plants that contain high amounts of [[vegetable oil]], such as [[oil palm]], [[soybean]], [[algae]], [[switchgrass]], or [[jatropha]].  These oils can be burned directly in certain designs of [[diesel engines]], or they can be chemically processed to produce fuels such as [[biodiesel]].  Wood and its byproducts can also be converted into biofuels such as [[woodgas]], [[methanol fuel|methanol]] or [[ethanol fuel]].&lt;ref name="forestry biofuels"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pu|first=Yunqiao |author2=Dongcheng Zhang |author3=Preet M. Singh |author4=Arthur J.

Biofuels are most commonly used in [[#Liquid fuels for transportation|vehicles]], and in heating homes, and [[Kitchen stove|cooking]]. Biofuel industries are expanding in [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Americas]].

Several firms have successfully created petroleum products in the lab using either solid catalysts  or genetically modified microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11565647 Grow your own - The biofuels of the future will be tailor-made], [[The Economist]], June 19th 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/4270240.html?series=19 For Future of Biofuel, Secret of MPG Ooze Lies in Mutant Bacteria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702120519/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/4270240.html?series=19 |date=2008-07-02 }}, [[Popular Mechanics]], June 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As of July, 2008, such firms are producing petroleum products in very small quantities, but hope to increase production over the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/03/biogasoline-virent.php Biogasoline: The Greener Alternative to Ethanol?]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Static installations====
The substitution of oil with other [[fossil fuel]]s is theoretically relatively easy when static installations are concerned, as in the case for [[electricity generation]]. Reserves of [[coal]] are substantial, and the technology to use it is well established. Increasing the use of coal, however, would lead to higher [[carbon emissions]] which is likely to be politically unacceptable in many countries due to the implications of [[global warming]], although [[carbon capture and storage]] may provide a solution. [[Natural gas]] is another alternative, and [[combined cycle]] power generation using natural gas is the cleanest source of power available using fossil fuels, producing about 30% less [[carbon dioxide]] than burning [[petroleum]] and about 45% less than burning [[coal]].&lt;ref&gt;

 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major difficulty in the  use of natural gas is [[transport]]ation and [[Natural gas storage|storage]] because of its low density. Natural gas [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] are economical, but are impractical across [[ocean]]s.

====Mobile applications====
{{See also|Biofuel|Hydrogen economy|Methanol economy|Hydrogen-powered aircraft}}
Due to its high [[energy density]] and [[Liquid fuels|ease of handling]], oil has a unique role as a [[transportation]] fuel. There are, however, a number of possible alternatives. Among the [[biofuel]]s the use of [[bioethanol]] and [[biodiesel]] is already established to some extent in some countries.

The use of [[hydrogen fuel]] is another alternative under development in various countries, alongside, [[hydrogen vehicle]]s&lt;ref name="California Hydrogen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrogenhighway.ca.gov|title=California Hydrogen Activities|date=November 26, 2012|work=[[California Hydrogen Highway]]|publisher=[[California Environmental Protection Agency]]|accessdate=9 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123233053/http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/zevprog/hydrogen/hydrogen.htm|archivedate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; though hydrogen is actually an energy storage medium, not a [[primary energy]] source, and consequently the use of a non-petroleum source would be required to extract the hydrogen for use. Though hydrogen is currently outperformed in terms of cost and efficiency by battery powered vehicles{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}, there are applications where it would come in useful. Short haul ferries and very cold climates are two examples. Hydrogen fuel cells are about a third as efficient as batteries and double the efficiency of gasoline vehicles.

Electric vehicles powered by batteries are another alternative, and these have the advantage of having the highest well-to-wheels efficiency rate of any energy pathway and thus would allow much greater numbers of vehicles than any other methods. In addition, even if the electricity was sourced from coal-fired power plants, two advantages would remain: first it is cheaper to sequester carbon from a few thousand smokestacks than it is to retrofit hundreds of millions of vehicles, and second encouraging the use of electric vehicles allows a further pathway for scaling up of [[renewable energy]] sources.

Currently the cost of batteries capable powering electric vehicles for a {{convert|300|mi|km|adj=on}} range (comparable to the range of many gasoline vehicles) is prohibitively high, though producing batteries for [[plug-in hybrid]]s with a {{convert|40|mi|km|adj=on}} range could be done with current technology and current pricing models within the reach of the average person. A plug-in hybrid with a {{convert|40|mi|km|adj=on}} range would have the advantage that it uses no gasoline or diesel at all for the first 40 miles (a distance covering 80% of all vehicle commutes).

Unfortunately there are currently no production models of plug-in hybrids or [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s (other than [[flex fuel]]) available from big manufacturers, though both [[Toyota]] and [[General Motors]] have promised versions around 2010. Fully electric vehicles are available from [[Tesla Motors]] for their high priced sports car and also a small city vehicle from [[Th!nk]] in Norway, in limited production runs in Norway and the UK.

====Alternative aviation fuel====
The [[Airbus A380]] flew on alternative fuel for the first time on 1 February 2008.{{citation needed |date=December 2011}} [[Boeing]] also plans to use alternative fuel on the [[Boeing 747|747]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/go/8133/ Boeing announce plans to accelerate bio-jet fuel development]&lt;/ref&gt; Because some biofuels such as ethanol contains less energy, more "tankstops" might be necessary for such planes.

The US Air Force is currently in the process of certifying its entire fleet to run on a 50/50 blend of synthetic fuel derived from the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] and [[JP-8]] jet fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation===
When alternative fuels are not available, the development of more energy efficient [[vehicle]]s becomes an important mitigant. Some ways of decreasing the oil used in transportation include increasing the use of [[bicycles]], [[public transport]], [[carpooling]], [[battery electric vehicle|electric vehicles]], and [[Diesel engine|diesel]] and [[hybrid vehicles]] with higher [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel efficiency]].

More comprehensive mitigations include better land use planning through [[smart growth]] to reduce the need for private transportation, increased capacity and use of [[Public transport|mass transit]], [[vanpool]]ing and [[carpool]]ing,&lt;ref name="ieareport"&gt;

In order to deal with potential problems from peak oil, [[Colin Campbell (geologist)|Colin Campbell]] has proposed the [[Rimini protocol]], a plan which among other things would require countries to balance oil consumption with their current production.

==Unconventional oil==
{{Main|Unconventional oil}}
Unconventional oil is oil produced or extracted using techniques other than the traditional [[oil well]] method from sources such as [[oil sand]]s, [[oil shale]] and the conversion of [[coal]] or [[natural gas]] to liquid [[hydrocarbons]] through processes such as  [[Fischer-Tropsch process|Fischer-Tropsch synthesis]]. Currently, unconventional oil production is less efficient and has a larger environmental impact relative to conventional oil production. Compared to conventional oil, much more energy is required to extract oil from non-conventional sources,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  |url=http://ostseis.anl.gov/guide/tarsands/index.cfm
  |title=About Tar Sands
  |publisher=Oil Shale and Tar Sands Leasing Programmatic EIS
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; so increasing costs and [[carbon emissions]]. Technology, such as using steam injection in oil sands deposits, is being developed to increase the efficiency of unconventional oil production.

[[Synthetic fuel]], created via [[coal]] liquefaction, requires no engine modifications for use in standard automobiles. As a byproduct of oil embargoes during [[Apartheid]] in [[South Africa]], [[Sasol]], using the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]], developed relatively low-cost coal-based fuel. Currently, about 30% of South Africa's transport-fuel (mostly diesel) is produced from coal.&lt;ref&gt;

One government which is moving forward with mitigation plans is the emirate of [[Abu Dhabi (emirate)|Abu Dhabi]].  The [[United Arab Emirates]] economy minister stated in 2007 that the UAE do not believe that relying on oil revenues is sustainable, and so are moving to diversify their economies.

==Bioplastics==
{{Main|Bioplastic}}
Another major factor in petroleum demand is the widespread use of petroleum products such as [[plastic]].  These could be partially replaced by bioplastics, which are derived from renewable plant feedstocks such as vegetable oil, [[corn starch]], hemp plants, pea starch,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&amp;CFTOKEN=19120617&amp;PJ_RCN=7901178&amp;CFID=6808047  Development of a pea starch film with trigger biodegradation properties for agricultural applications]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[microbiota (microbiology)|microbiota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==US government debate over mitigation strategies==
Part of the current debate revolves around energy policy, and whether to shift funding to increasing [[energy conservation]], [[fuel efficiency]], or other energy sources like [[solar power|solar]], [[wind power|wind]], and [[nuclear power]]. At congressional peak oil hearings, Rep. [[Tom Udall]] argued that while rising oil prices would encourage alternatives (both on the supply and demand side), the costs and impacts of other issues involved with petroleum based personal transportation (such as pollution, the economic [[effects of global warming]], security threats caused by sending vast amounts of money to the Middle East, and the costs of road maintenance) should also be taken into account.  "Because the price of oil is artificially low, significant private investment in alternative technologies that provide a long-term payback does not exist. Until oil and its alternatives compete in a fair market, new technologies will not thrive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2005, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] suggested that, "the federal government could more effectively increase the efficiency of the nation's automotive fleet by raising gasoline taxes, imposing user fees on the purchase of [[Fuel economy in automobiles|low-mileage-per-gallon]] vehicles, or both."  This would give automakers more incentive to research alternative fuel technology and increased efficiency (through lighter vehicles, better aerodynamics, and less wasted energy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Hans-Holger Rogner]], a section head at the [[IAEA]], warned in 1997 that the level of incentive required for market driven research and development will actually rise.  Because production costs are not expected to decrease and because of the continued emphasis companies give to short-term profits, "a regional breakdown for 11 world regions indicates that neither hydrocarbon resource availability nor costs are likely to become forces that automatically would help wean the global energy system from the use of fossil fuel during the next century."&lt;ref name="HHRogner1997"&gt;{{cite journal

The problems of privately funded research and development are not unique to peak oil mitigation.  Bronwyn H. Hall, graduate economics professor at the [[Haas School of Business]], points out that, "even if problems associated with incomplete appropriability of the returns to [[R&amp;D]] are solved using [[intellectual property]] protection, [[subsidies]], or tax incentives, it may still be difficult or costly to finance R&amp;D using capital from sources external to the firm or entrepreneur. That is, there is often a wedge, sometimes large, between the rate of return required by an entrepreneur investing his own funds and that required by external investors." &lt;ref name="BHHall2002"&gt;{{cite journal

In the US, transportation by car is guided more by the government than by an [[invisible hand]]. Roads and the [[interstate highway system]] were built by local, state and federal governments and paid for by [[income tax]]es, [[property tax]]es, [[fuel tax]]es, and tolls. The [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)|Strategic Petroleum Reserve]] is designed to offset market imbalances.

There is also a [[Fuel economy in automobiles#Gas Guzzler Tax|gas guzzler tax]] of limited scope.

In order to be profitable, many alternatives to oil require the price of oil to remain above some level. Investors in these alternatives must gamble with the limited data on oil reserves available. This imperfect information can lead to a [[market failure]] caused by a [[move by nature]].  One explanation for this is [[Hotelling's rule]] for [[non-renewable resources]]. Even with [[perfect information]] the price of oil correlates with spare capacity and spare capacity does not warn of a peak.  For example, in the early 1960s (10 years before oil production peaked in the United States), there was enough spare capacity in US production that Hubbert's predicted peak of 1966-1971 was "at the very least completely unrealistic to most people," preventing the necessary steps being taken to mitigate the situation.  The [[Peak oil#Reserves|absence of accurate information]] about spare production capacity exacerbates the current situation.&lt;ref name="AJCavallo2004"&gt;

==Implications of an unmitigated world peak==
{{See also|Hirsch report}}
[[Image:PU200611 Fig1.png|thumb|300px|Oil depletion scenarios]]
According to the [[Hirsch report]] prepared for the U.S. Department of Energy in 2005, a global decline in oil production would have serious social and economic implications without due preparation. Initially, an unmitigated peak in oil production would manifest itself as rapidly escalating prices and a worldwide [[energy crisis]]. While past oil shortages stemmed from a temporary insufficiency of supply, crossing Hubbert's Peak means that the production of oil continues to decline, so demand must be reduced to meet supply. If alternatives or conservation (orderly [[demand destruction]]) are not forthcoming, then disorderly demand destruction will occur, with the possible effect that the many products and services produced with oil become scarcer, leading to lower [[living standard]]s.

The '''National Conference on Citizenship''' (NCoC) is a non-partisan, non-profit organization dedicated to strengthening civic life in America. They pursue their mission through a nationwide network of partners involved in a cutting-edge Civic Health Initiative, annual cross-sector conferences, and engagement with a broad spectrum of individuals and organizations interested in utilizing civic engagement principles and practices to enhance their work.  Connecting people for the purpose of strengthening civic life is NCoC's goal.  At the core of NCoC's joint efforts is the belief that every person has the ability to help his or her community and country thrive.

NCoC was chartered by Congress in 1953 to harness the patriotic energy and national civic involvement surrounding World War II. In 2009, Congress named NCoC in the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, expanding their Civic Health Initiative to become the nation’s largest measure of civic engagement.

For the past 10 years NCoC, together with the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) and state and community level collaborative networks across the nation, has documented the state of civic life in America in city, state, and national Civic Health Index (CHI) reports. NCoC plans to establish CHI partnerships in all 50 states and the District of Columbia by 2020.

The Civic Health Initiative has been an incubator for programs such as the Civic Data Challenge and The Civic 50. The Civic Data Challenge was a national competition to turn the raw data of civic health into useful applications and visualizations. The Civic 50 is an initiative to identify the 50 most community-minded companies in the nation.

The Annual Conference on Citizenship is NCoC's signature event. Held in proximity to Citizenship Day (also known as Constitution Day) in the fall, NCoC convenes leaders in the field of civic engagement to exchange information and to discuss ways to progress their shared mission of encouraging Americans to become fully involved citizens. In addition to the Annual Conference, NCoC has partnered with institutions to host and convene programs, events, webinars, and discussions throughout the year.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

After 2013, NCoC expanded their programs to promote national service. They took a leading role in the creation of the Service Year technology platform. They worked in partnership with the Franklin Project at the Aspen Institute. The platform is an online marketplace designed to increase service opportunities for Americans between 18–28 years old. It brings together young people seeking service positions, organizations seeking service members, and funders looking to support these efforts.


==Mission statement==
NCoC is a congressionally chartered organization dedicated to strengthening civic life in America. We believe every person has the power to help their community and country thrive.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ncoc.net/about|title=About Us {{!}} National Conference on Citizenship|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origin: (1946-1953)===
Purpose of NCoC: To Support and Strengthen the Efforts of the People in Maintaining the Blessings of Freedom and Justice and in Protecting and Perpetuating the Principles and Ideals upon which this Nation is Founded; to Develop a More Thorough Knowledge of Citizenship Rights and Responsibilities; to Inspire a Deeper Devotion to Citizenship Obligations; to Encourage Ever More Effective Participation in Citizenship Activities and to Promote a Spirit of Cooperation on the Part of all Citizens – to these High Purposes, the National Conference on Citizenship is Dedicated.

Founded in 1946, in the aftermath of the Second World War, NCoC was inspired by efforts of a diverse group of Americans and created with the goal of capturing and perpetuating, in peacetime, the spirit of cooperation and civic energy fostered during wartime. With the collective attention of the nation returning to domestic affairs, NCoC was imagined as a vehicle to highlight the critical importance of civic responsibility to the health of our republic so that all citizens might dedicate themselves to upholding continuously our concept of government and the democratic way of life.

The First National Conference on Citizenship was held on May 17–18, 1946 in Philadelphia, PA

===Congressional Charter===
On August 13, 1953, President Dwight Eisenhower signed a bill that was passed by both houses of Congress that incorporated the Conference; allowing the NCoC to now operate under a Federal Charter.  A Federal Charter is federal statue that establishes a co-operation between the government and organizations, agencies, or institutions.
In 1953, the goal of the Congressional Charter was to empower “the NCoC to translate its ideals and objectives into realities. Plans for the future include both long-range and immediate projects and activates. The Conference will initiate and conduct some of these activities directly. Other, it will encourage and assist organizations and agencies in States and communities to initiate and carry on.”
There are approximately 1,478,000 non-profits in America—94 of them are chartered by Congress.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

===Present: (2004- Present)===
In 2006, NCoC convened a working group to create the first “America’s Civic Health Index.” Utilizing a variety of indicators, the Civic Health Index (CHI) provides insight into civic trends at the national, state, city, and demographic level.

In 2009, Congress named NCoC in the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. This legislation codified and expanded NCoC's CHI helping it become the nation’s largest and most definitive measure of civic engagement.

In 2012, NCoC launched two new programs:
* ''[http://www.civic50.org/ The Civic 50]'' is an initiative to identify the 50 most community-minded companies in the nation. ''The Civic 50'' surveys and ranks S&amp;P 500 corporations on how they engage with the communities they serve and institutionalize these practices in their corporate culture. [https://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst/most-community-minded-in-u-dot-s-companies 2013 Rankings]
* [http://www.civicdatachallenge.org/ Civic Data Challenge] is a nationwide online competition that brings together tech, design, and nonprofit professionals together with local community leaders and organization to create apps, websites, and other tools to be used to increase civic participation. [http://www.civicdatachallenge.org/2013-finalists View the 2013 winners.]

In 2013, NCoC started its partnership with the [[Franklin Project]] at the [[Aspen Institute]] to develop a [http://www.youserve.org/ Service Year technology platform]. This system aims to be a 21st-century tool that will increase the number of organizations that can provide national service opportunities and make it easier for young Americans to identify those positions.

In 2016, NCoC and [[Service Year Alliance]] ended their partnership. They continue to support each other's efforts.

==Programs==
NCoC's current programming includes the Civic Health Initiative, consisting of the Civic Health Index, and the Annual Conference on Citizenship.

===Civic Health Index===
The Civic Health Index (CHI) is at the center of NCoC's work. At NCoC, “civic health” is considered the way that communities are organized to define and address public problems. Communities with strong indicators of civic health have higher employment rates, stronger schools, better physical health, and more responsive governments. For the past 10 years NCoC, together with the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) and state and community level collaborative networks across the nation, has documented the state of civic life in America in city, state, and national CHI reports. CHIs use a range of indicators including volunteering, voting, connections to civic and religious organizations, trust in other Americans and key institutions, and other civic behavior and attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ncoc.net/CHI|title=Chief Operating Officer {{!}} National Conference on Citizenship|date=2016-06-17|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CHI partnerships have changed the way governments go about their work, reintroduced civics to classrooms, redirected investments, influenced national and local conversations resulting in enhancing civic life, and bolstered a network of civic leaders across the country.  By 2020, NCoC's goal is to integrate this pioneering initiative into ongoing partnerships in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

America’s Civic Health Index received a new level of recognition through its inclusion in the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, which was signed into law in May 2009. The Act formalized a partnership between NCoC, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Corporation for National and Community Service to develop, refine, and implement an annual civic health assessment.

In addition to the America’s Civic Health Index report, the National Conference on Citizenship partners with local institutions to release state and city specific reports. NCoC currently works with over 30 local partners.

===Annual Conference===
The National Conference on Citizenship hosts an annual conference on or around Citizenship Day. NCoC convenes leaders in the field of civic engagement along with other individuals and organizations interested in utilizing civic engagement principles and practices to enhance their work. Connecting people for the purpose of strengthening civic life is the goal. Each year’s conference revolves around a different theme that concerns various aspects of civic engagement on a multitude of levels, including corporate, institutional, and individual responsibility.

Featured Annual Conference Speakers have included: Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], former Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], Senator [[Robert Byrd]], Senator [[Harris Wofford]], Senator [[Bob Graham]], [[Jean Case]], [[Sonal Shah (economist)|Sonal Shah]], Minnesota Secretary of State [[Mark Ritchie]], [[Scott Heiferman]], [[Craig Newmark]], &amp; [[Sean Parker]].

[[Image:Natl Hist Trail route signs.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Signs used along the historic and scenic trails to mark the modern roads and significant points.]]
The '''National Trails System''' was created by the '''National Trails System Act''' ({{USStatute|90|543|82|919|1968|10|02}}), codified at  {{usc|16|1241}} ''[[et seq.]]''

The Act created a series of National [[trail]]s "to promote the preservation of, public access to, travel within, and enjoyment and appreciation of the open-air, outdoor areas and historic resources of the Nation." Specifically, the Act authorized three types of trails: the [[National Scenic Trail]]s, [[National Recreation Trail]]s and connecting-and-side trails. The 1968 Act also created two national scenic trails: the [[Appalachian Trail|Appalachian]] and the [[Pacific Crest Trail|Pacific Crest]]; and requested that an additional fourteen trail routes be studied for possible inclusion.

In 1978, as a result of the study of trails that were most significant for their historic associations, a fourth category of trail was added: the [[National Historic Trail]]s. Since 1968, over forty trail routes have been studied for inclusion in the system. Of these studied trails, twenty-one have been established as part of the system. Today, the National Trails System consists of 30 National Scenic and Historic Trails and over 1,000 National Recreation Trail and two connecting-and-side trails, with a total length of more than {{Convert|50000|mi|km|-4}}. These National Trails are more than just for [[hiking]], many are also open for [[Trail riding|horseback riding]], [[mountain bicycling|mountain biking]] and [[camping]].

As Congressionally established [[long-distance trail]]s, each one is administered by a federal agency, either the [[Bureau of Land Management]], [[United States Forest Service]], or [[National Park Service]]. Two of the trails are jointly administered by the BLM and the NPS. Occasionally, these agencies acquire lands to protect key sites, resources and [[viewshed]]s. More often than not, they work in partnership with the states, local units of government, [[land trust]]s and private landowners, to protect lands and structures along these trails, enabling them to be accessible to the public. National Recreation Trails and connecting-and-side trails do not require Congressional action, but are recognized by actions of the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] or the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]].   All of the National Trails are supported by private non-profit organizations that work with the various federal agencies under the '''Partnership for the National Trails System''' ('''PNTS''').

The Act is codified as {{UnitedStatesCode3|16|1241|1251}}. However, it has been amended numerous times since its passage,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1241- Notes on 16 U.S.C. § 1241-1251]&lt;/ref&gt; most recently on October 18, 2004 ({{USPL|108|342}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/ncrc/programs/nts/legislation.html The Act], from the [[National Park Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Scenic Trails==
{{Main|National Scenic Trail}}
National Scenic Trails are established to provide access to ''spectacular natural beauty and to allow the pursuit of healthy outdoor recreation''.  The National Scenic Trail system provides access to the crest of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in the east, on the [[Appalachian Trail]], to the [[Rocky Mountains]] of the west on the [[Continental Divide Trail]].  These provide access to viewing the subtle beauties of the southern [[wetland]]s and [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] on the [[Florida Trail]], wandering the [[Laurentian Mixed Forest Province|North Woods]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[North Dakota]] on the [[North Country Trail]], or experiencing the vast diversity of landscapes of the southwest on the [[Arizona National Scenic Trail]].  Of the eleven national scenic trails,&lt;ref&gt;National Trails System brochure, National Park Service &amp; Bureau of Land Management, Dept. of Interior; and the Forest Service, Dept. of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt; Appalachian, Natchez Trace, and Potomac Heritage are [[List of the United States National Park System official units|official units]] of the NPS.

==National Historic Trails==
{{Main|National Historic Trail}}
National Historic Trails are designated to protect the remains of significant overland or water routes to reflect the history of the nation. They represent the earliest travels across the continent on the [[Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail]]; the nation's struggle for independence on the [[Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail]]; epic migrations on the [[Mormon Trail|Mormon]] &amp; [[Oregon Trail]]s and the development of continental commerce on the [[Santa Fe Trail]]. They also commemorate the forced displacement and hardships of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], on the [[Trail of Tears]].  There are 19 Historic Trails.&lt;ref&gt;National Trails System, National Park Service &amp; Bureau of Land Management, Dept. of Interior; and the Forest Service, Dept. of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of them are [[scenic route]]s instead of non-motorized trails.

==National Connecting and Side Trails==
The act also established a category of trails known as connecting and side trails.  To date, only two national side trails have been designated, both in 1990: The Timms Hill Trail, which connects the [[Ice Age Trail]] to Wisconsin's highest point, [[Timms Hill]], and the 86-mile Anvik Connector, which joins the [[Iditarod Trail]] to the village of [[Anvik, Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://usparks.about.com/library/weekly/aa060599.htm About.com article on National Trails system] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405102111/http://usparks.about.com/library/weekly/aa060599.htm |date=2015-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Probation}}
{{globalize|article|common law jurisdictions|date=March 2017}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2012}}
{{Wills, trusts, estates}}
'''Probate''' is the judicial process whereby a will is "proved" in a court of law and accepted as a valid public document that is the true last testament of the deceased, or whereby the estate is settled according to the laws of [[intestacy]] in the state of residence [or real property] of the deceased at time of death in the absence of a legal will.

The granting of probate is the first step in the [[legal]] process of administering the [[estate (law)|estate]] of a deceased person, resolving all claims and distributing the deceased person's [[property]] under a will. A [[probate court]] decides the legal validity of a [[testator]]'s (deceased person's) will and grants its approval, also known as granting probate, to the executor. The probated will then becomes a [[legal instrument]] that may be enforced by the executor in the law courts if necessary. A probate also officially appoints the [[executor]] (or [[personal representative]]), generally named in the will, as having legal power to dispose of the testator's assets in the manner specified in the testator's will. However, through the probate process, a will may be [[Will contest|contested]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Harvey|title=Dealing with probate in 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/feb/15/dealing-with-probate-in-2013|accessdate=19 September 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
===Executor===
{{Main|Executor}}
An executor is the person appointed by a will to act on behalf of the estate of the will maker (the "[[testator]]") upon his or her death. An executor is the [[legal personal representative]] of a deceased person's estate. The appointment of an executor only becomes effective after the death of the testator. After the testator dies, the person named in the will as executor can decline or renounce the position, and if that is the case should very quickly notify the probate court registry accordingly. There is no legal obligation for that person to accept the appointment.

Executors "step into the shoes" of the deceased and have similar rights and powers to wind up the personal affairs of the deceased. This may include continuing or filing lawsuits to which the deceased was entitled to bring, making claims for [[wrongful death]], paying off creditors, or selling or disposing of assets not particularly gifted in the will, among others. But the role of the executor is to resolve the testator's estate and to distribute the estate to the beneficiaries or those otherwise entitled.

Sometimes, in England and Wales, a professional executor is named in the will – not a family member but (for example) a solicitor, bank or other financial institution. Professional executors will charge the estate for carrying out duties related to the administration of the estate; this can leave the family facing additional and unexpected costs. It is possible to get a professional executor to renounce their role meaning they will have no part in dealing with the estate; or to reserve their power which means the remaining executors will carry out the related duties, but without the involvement of the professional executor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oratto.co.uk/wiki/probate-solicitors/professional-executors|title=Professional Executors|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oratto.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrator===
When a person dies without a will then the legal personal representative is known as the "administrator".
This is commonly the closest relative, although that person can renounce their right to be Administrator in which case the right moves to the next closest relative. This often happens when parents or grandparents are first in line to become the administrator but renounce their rights as they are old, don’t have knowledge of estate law and feel that someone else is better suited to the task.

The appointment of an administrator follows a codified list establishing priority appointees. Classes of persons named higher on the list receive priority of appointment to those lower on the list. Although appointees named in the will and relatives of the deceased frequently receive priority over all others, creditors of the deceased and 'any other citizen [of that jurisdiction]' may act as an administrator if there is some cognizable reason or relationship to the estate. Alternatively, if no other person qualifies or no other person accepts appointment, the court will appoint a representative from the local public administrator's office.

===Probate clause===
{{update|section|reason=a more modern example is preferred|date=March 2017}}
A representative example of a complete probate clause, from the 14th century (or earlier) onwards, added at the bottom of the office transcribed copy of a will is as follows, taken from the will of Anthony Bathurst, 1697, PROB 11/438:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=Will_of_Anthony_Bathurst,_1697,_PROB_11/438|title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT] UK Government Web Archive – The National Archives: Will of Anthony Bathurst, 1697|publisher=Internet Memory Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''PROBATUM fuit huiusmodi testamentum apud Londinium coram &lt;ref&gt;The name (and its related adjectives) after the preposition ''coram'' ("in the presence of") must be stated in the ablative case&lt;/ref&gt; venerabili et egregio viro domino Richardo Raines, milite, legum doctore curiae praerogativae &lt;ref&gt;''curiae praerogativae'', locative case&lt;/ref&gt; Cantuariensis magistro custodis sive commissarii legitime constituti vicesimo tertio die mensis Junii Anno Domini Millesimo Sexcenti Nonaginta Septimo juramento &lt;ref&gt;''Juramento'', ablative of late-Latin noun ''Juramentum'', oath, thus "By the oath of, with the oath of", the name following of the executor is therefore stated in the genitive case&lt;/ref&gt; Mariae Bathurst relictae et executricis in dicto testamento nominata cui commissa fuit administratio omnium et singulorum bonorum, jurium et creditorum dicti defuncti de bene et fideliter administrando &lt;ref&gt;''Administrando'': ablative of [[gerund]] of verb administro&lt;/ref&gt; eadem ad sancta Dei Evangelis jurat. Examinatur''. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Translated literally as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This will was proved at London before the worshipful Sir Richard Raines, knight, Doctor of Laws, Master Keeper or Commissary of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, lawfully constituted, on the twenty third day of the month of June in the year of our Lord one thousand six hundred and ninety seven, by the oath of Mary Bathurst, relict and executrix named in the said will, to whom administration was granted of all and singular the goods, rights and credits of the said deceased, sworn on the holy Gospel of God to well and faithfully administer the same. It has been examined". 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Etymology===
The English noun "probate" derives directly from the [[Latin]] verb ''probare'',&lt;ref&gt;Collins Dictionary of the English Language&lt;/ref&gt; to try, test, prove, examine,&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; more specifically from the verb's [[past participle]] nominative neuter ''probatum'',&lt;ref&gt;''Testamentum'', the participle refers to, being a neuter noun&lt;/ref&gt; "having been proved". Historically during many centuries a paragraph in Latin of standard format was written by scribes of the particular probate court below the transcription of the will, commencing with the words (for example): ''Probatum Londini fuit huismodi testamentum coram venerabili viro'' (name of approver) ''legum doctore curiae prerogativae Cantuariensis...'' ("A testament of such a kind was proved at London in the presence of the venerable man ..... doctor of law at the [[Prerogative Court]] of Canterbury...")&lt;ref&gt;Text from will of [[James Boevey]] (d.1696)&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest usage of the English word was in 1463, defined as "the official proving of a will".&lt;ref name="etymonline-probate"&gt;{{OEtymD|probate|accessdate=5 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "[[probative]]," used in the law of [[evidence]], comes from the same Latin root but has a different English usage.

==Probate process==
{{See also|Administration (probate law)}} 
Probate is a process of improvement that proves a [[Will (law)|will]] of a deceased person is valid, so their property can in due course be retitled (US terminology) or transferred to beneficiaries of the will. As with any legal proceeding, there are technical aspects to probate administration:&lt;ref name="ukprobate"&gt;For the U.K., see, e.g., {{cite web|title=Wills, probate and inheritance|url=https://www.gov.uk/wills-probate-inheritance|website=Gov.UK|accessdate=20 September 2017}}, {{cite web|title=Probate|url=http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/for-the-public/common-legal-issues/probate/|website=The Law Society|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auprobate"&gt;For Australia, See, e.g., {{cite web|title=What is Probate?|url=http://www.publictrustee.wa.gov.au/W/what_is_probate.aspx?uid=8745-7100-0334-7099|website=Public Trustee|accessdate=20 September 2017|date=8 February 2017}}, {{cite web|title=Probate FAQs|url=http://www.supremecourt.wa.gov.au/P/probate_faqs.aspx|website=Supreme Court of Western Australia|accessdate=20 September 2017|date=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caprobate"&gt;For Canada, see e.g., {{cite news|last1=Kaufman|first1=Leanne|title=To probate or not to probate|url=http://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/retirement/inheritance/to-probate-or-not-to-probate|accessdate=20 September 2017|publisher=Financial Post|date=22 February 2013}}, {{cite web|title=Probating an Estate|url=https://www.sasklawcourts.ca/home/court-of-queen-s-bench/wills-and-estates/probating-an-estate|website=Courts of Saskatchewan|accessdate=20 September 2017|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usprobate"&gt;For the United States, see e.g., {{cite web|title=When Someone Dies - A Non-Lawyer's Guide to Probate in Washington, DC|url=https://www.lawhelp.org/dc/resource/when-someone-dies-a-non-lawyers-guide-to-probate-in-washington-dc|website=Lawhelp.org|publisher=Council for Court Excellence|accessdate=20 September 2017}}, {{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How Probate Works|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/estates-wills-trusts/how-probate-works|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=20 September 2017|date=13 June 2017}}, {{cite web|title=Wills, Estates, and Probate|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/8865.htm|website=Judicial Branch of California|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Creditors must be notified and legal notices published.
* Executors of the will must be guided in how and when to distribute assets and how to take creditors' rights into account.
* A Petition to appoint a [[personal representative]] may need to be filed and letters of administration (often referred to as "letters testamentary") issued. A Grant of Letters of Administration can be used as proof that the ‘Administrator' is entitled to handle the assets.
* Homestead property, which follows its own set of unique rules in states like Florida, must be dealt with separately from other assets. In many [[common law]] jurisdictions such as Canada, parts of the US, the UK, Australia and India, jointly owned property passes automatically to the surviving joint owner separately from any will, unless the [[equitable title]] is held as [[tenants in common]].
* There are time factors involved in filing and objecting to claims against the estate.
* There may be a lawsuit pending over the decedent's death or there may have been pending suits that are now continuing. There may be separate procedures required in contentious probate cases.
* [[Real estate]] or other property may need to be sold to effect correct distribution of assets pursuant to the will or merely to pay debts.
* Estate taxes, gift taxes or inheritance taxes must be considered if the estate exceeds certain thresholds.
* Costs of the administration including ordinary taxation such as income tax on interest and property taxation is deducted from assets in the estate before distribution by the executors of the will.
* Other assets may simply need to be transferred from the deceased to his or her beneficiaries, such as life insurance. Other assets may have pay on death or transfer on death designations, which avoids probate.
* The rights of beneficiaries must be respected, in terms of providing proper and adequate notice, making timely distribution of estate assets, and otherwise administering the estate properly and efficiently.

Local laws governing the probate process often depend on the value and complexity of the estate. If the value of the estate is relatively small, the probate process may be avoided. In some jurisdictions and/or at a certain threshold, probate must be applied for by the Executor/Administrator or a Probate [[lawyer]] filing on their behalf.

A probate lawyer offers services in probate court, and may be retained to open an estate or offer service during the course of probate proceedings on behalf of the administrator or executor of the estate. Probate lawyers may also represent heirs, creditors and other parties who have a legal interest in the outcome of the estate.

In common law jurisdictions, probate ("official proving of a will") is obtained by executors of a will while [[letters of administration]] are granted where there are no executors.&lt;ref name=Collinson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Collinson|first1=Patrick|title=Probate: avoid a final rip-off when sorting out your loved one's estate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/21/probate-avoid-rip-off-comparing|accessdate=19 September 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australia ==
In Australia, probate refers to the process of proving of the will of a deceased person and also to a Grant of Probate, the legal document that is obtained.&lt;ref name="auprobate"/&gt;

There is a Supreme Court probate registry in each jurisdiction that deals with probate applications. However, each State and Territory has slightly different laws and processes in relation to probate. The main probate legislation is as follows:
* In New South Wales, the Probate and Administration Act 1898 (NSW).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/|title=Probate and Administration Act 1898|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applying for a grant of probate ===
Only the executor(s) of a will can apply for a Grant of Probate. It is the duty of the executor(s) of the will to obtain probate in a timely manner. The executor(s) can apply for probate themselves (which is often done to reduce legal fees) or be represented by a lawyer.

To obtain a grant of probate, there must have been a valid will and assets left by the deceased person. Usually, asset holders require a Grant of Probate unless:
* estate assets only consist of a small amount (usually under $50,000 for major banks and lower thresholds for other financial institutions), and/or
* jointly held assets (and does not consist of real estate in the deceased’s name sole or as tenant in common).

=== Distributing the estate ===
After probate is granted, the executor(s) is also responsible for distributing the assets in accordance with the will. Some Australian jurisdictions require a notice of intended distribution to be published before the estate is distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlineregistry.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/content/probate-notices/frequently-asked-questions-about-publishing-probate-notice|title=Frequently asked questions about publishing a probate notice {{!}} Online Registry|website=onlineregistry.lawlink.nsw.gov.au|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
===England and Wales===
The main source of [[English law]] is the [[Wills Act 1837]]. Probate, as with the law of family settlements (trusts), was handled by the [[Court of Chancery]].&lt;ref name="ukprobate"/&gt; When that court was abolished in 1873,&lt;ref&gt;[[Judicature Act 1873]]&lt;/ref&gt; their jurisdiction passed to the [[Chancery Division]] of the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]].

====Definition====
When someone dies, the term "probate" usually refers to the legal process whereby the deceased's assets are collected together and, following various legal and fiscal steps and processes, eventually distributed to the beneficiaries of the estate. Technically the term has a particular legal meaning, but it is generally used within the English legal profession as a term to cover all procedures concerned with the administration of a deceased person's estate. As a legal discipline the subject is vast and it is only possible in an article such as this to cover the most common situations, but even that only scratches the surface.&lt;ref name=Collinson/&gt;

====Jurisdiction====
All legal procedures concerned with probate (as defined above) come within the jurisdiction of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice by virtue of Section 25 of the [[Senior Courts Act 1981]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part57|title=PART 57 - PROBATE, INHERITANCE AND PRESUMPTION OF DEATH - Civil Procedure Rules|website=www.justice.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court is, therefore, the only body able to issue documents that confer on someone the ability to deal with a deceased person's estate—close bank accounts or sell property. It is the production and issuing of these documents, known collectively as ''grants of representation'', that is the primary function of the Probate Registries, which are part of the High Court, which the general public and probate professionals alike apply to for grants of representation.&lt;ref name=Collinson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/infoabout/civil/probate/registries.htm |title=About HM Courts &amp; Tribunals Service |publisher=Hmcourts-service.gov.uk |date=2011-04-01 |accessdate=2014-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606125411/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/infoabout/civil/probate/registries.htm |archivedate=6 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grants of representation====
There are many different types of grants of representation, each one designed to cover a particular circumstance. The most common cover the two most common situations—either the deceased died leaving a valid will or they did not. If someone left a valid will, it is more than likely that the grant is a ''grant of probate''. If there was no will, the grant required is likely to be a ''grant of administration''. There are many other grants that can be required in certain circumstances, and many have technical Latin names, but the general public is most likely to encounter grants of probate or administration. If an estate has a value of less than £5,000.00 or if all assets are held jointly and therefore pass by survivorship, for example to a surviving spouse, a grant is not usually required.

=====Applying for a grant=====
A will includes the appointment of Executor(s). One of their duties is to apply to the Probate Division of the High Court for a Grant of Probate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Applying for probate|url=https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/applying-probate|website=nidreict Government Services|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wills, probate and inheritance|url=https://www.gov.uk/wills-probate-inheritance/applying-for-a-grant-of-representation|website=Gov.UK|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Executor can apply to a local probate registry for a grant themselves but most people use a probate practitioner such as a solicitor. If an estate is small, some banks and building societies allow the deceased's immediate family to close accounts without a grant, but there usually must be less than about £15,000 in the account for this to be permitted.&lt;ref name=Collinson/&gt;

====Asset distribution====
The persons who are actually given the job of dealing with the deceased's assets are called "personal representatives" or "PRs". If the deceased left a valid will, the PRs are the "executors" appointed by the will—"I appoint X and Y to be my executors etc." If there is no will or if the will does not contain a valid appointment of executors (for example if they are all dead) then the PRs are called "administrators". So, executors obtain a grant of probate that permits them to deal with the estate and administrators obtain a grant of administration that lets them do the same. Apart from that distinction, the function of executors and administrators is exactly the same.&lt;ref name=Collinson/&gt;

====Probate requirements====
A requirement of the Probate process is the valuation of the Estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valuing the estate of someone who's died|url=https://www.gov.uk/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died|website=Gov.UK|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collinson/&gt;

====Intestacy probate process====
For an explanation of the intestacy probate process in England and Wales, see [[Administration of an estate on death]].

====Contesting the circumstances of a will's creation====
An applicant may challenge the validity of a person’s will after they have died by lodging a '''Caveat''' and requisite fee at the probate registry. This prevents anyone from obtaining a grant of probate for that person’s estate for six months, which the applicant can shortly before that point apply to extend. A caveat is not be used to extend the time for bringing a claim for financial provision from a person’s estate, such as under the [[Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975]]. The court can order costs against an applicant using a caveat for that purpose.&lt;ref name=s&gt;http://www.stephensons.co.uk/site/individuals/contesting_wills_probate/caveats_warnings/&lt;/ref&gt;

To challenge the caveat, the intended executor sends a completed “'''Warning'''” form to the probate registry. This document will be sent to the person who entered the caveat, and for the caveat to remain, they will have to enter an '''Appearance''' at the probate registry.&lt;ref name=s/&gt; This is not a physical appearance; it is a further document to send to the probate registry within eight days of receiving the warning.&lt;ref name=s/&gt;

===Scotland===
The equivalent to probate in Scotland is '''confirmation''', although there are considerable differences between the two systems because of the separate [[Scots law|Scottish legal system]]. Appointment as an executor does not in itself give confer authority to ingather and distribute the estate of the deceased; the executor(s) must make an application to the [[sheriff court]] for a grant of confirmation. This is a [[court order]] authorising them to "uplift, receive, administer and dispose of the estate and to act in the office of executor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gloag and Henderson|title=The Law of Scotland|date=2017|publisher=W. Green|pages=1130|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt; A grant of confirmation gives the executor(s) authority to uplift money or other property belonging to a deceased person (e.g. from a bank), and to administer and distribute it according to either the deceased's will or the law on [[intestacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dealing With a Deceased’s Estate in Scotland|url=https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/taking-action/dealing-with-a-deceased%27s-estate-in-scotland|website=Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{See also|Uniform Probate Code}}
{{One source|date=October 2007}}

Most estates in the United States include property that is subject to probate proceedings.&lt;ref name="usprobate"/&gt; If the property of an estate is not automatically devised to a surviving spouse or heir through principles of joint ownership or survivorship, or otherwise by [[operation of law]], and was not transferred to a [[Living trust|trust]] during the decedent's lifetime, it is generally necessary to "probate the estate", whether or not the decedent had a valid [[will (law)|will]].

Some states have procedures that allow for the transfer of assets from small estates through affidavit or through a simplified probate process. For example, California has a “Small Estate Summary Procedure” to allow the summary transfer of a decedent’s asset without a formal Probate proceeding. The dollar limit by which the Small Estate procedure can be effectuated is $150,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Affidavit for Transfer of Personal Property Worth $150,000 or Less|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/10440.htm|website=California Courts|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For estates that do not qualify for simplified proceedings, a court having jurisdiction of the decedent's estate (a probate court) supervises the probate process to ensure administration and disposition of the decedent's property is conducted in accord with the law of that jurisdiction, and in a manner consistent with decedent's intent as manifested in his will. Distribution of certain estate assets may require selling assets, including real estate.

===Avoiding probate===
Some of the decedent's property may never enter probate because it passes to another person [[contract]]ually, such as the death proceeds of an insurance policy insuring the decedent or bank or retirement account that names a beneficiary or is owned as "payable on death", and property (sometimes a bank or brokerage account) legally held as "jointly owned with right of survivorship".

Property held in a [[Living trust|revocable]] or irrevocable trust created during the grantor's lifetime also avoids probate. In these cases in the U.S. no court action is involved and the property is distributed privately, subject to estate taxes.

The best way to determine which assets are probate assets (requiring administration) is to determine whether each asset passes outside of probate.

In jurisdictions in the U.S. that recognize a married couple's property as [[tenancy by the entireties]], if a spouse (or partner in Hawaii) dies intestate (owning property without a will), the portion of his/her estate so titled passes to a surviving spouse without a probate.

===Steps of probate===

If the decedent dies without a will, known as [[intestacy]], the estate is distributed according to the laws of the state where the decedent resided.

If the decedent died with a will, the will usually names an [[executor]] (personal representative), who carries out the instructions laid out in the will. The executor marshals the decedent's assets. If there is no will, or if the will does not name an executor, the probate court can appoint one. Traditionally, the representative of an [[Wiktionary:testate|intestate]] estate is called an ''administrator''. If the decedent died with a will, but only a copy of the will can be located, many states allow the copy to be probated, subject to the rebuttable presumption that the testator destroyed the will before death.

In some cases, where the person named as executor cannot administer the probate, or wishes to have someone else do so, another person is named administrator. An executor or an administrator may receive compensation for his service. Additionally, beneficiaries of an estate may be able to remove the appointed executor if he or she is not capable of properly fulfilling his or her duties.

The representative of a testate estate who is someone other than the executor named in the will is an ''administrator with the will annexed'', or administrator c.t.a. (from the Latin ''cum testamento annexo''.) The generic term for executors or administrators is [[personal representative]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The probate court may require that the executor provide a [[fidelity bond]], an insurance policy in favor of the estate to protect against possible abuse by the executor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Neill|first1=Kevin|title=Probate|url=http://www.co.warren.nj.us/surrogate/probate.html|website=Office of the Surrogate|publisher=Warren County, New Jersey|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After opening the probate case with the court, the personal representative inventories and collects the decedent's property. Next, he pays any debts and taxes, including [[estate tax in the United States]], if the estate is taxable at the federal or state level. Finally, he distributes the remaining property to the beneficiaries, either as instructed in the will, or under the [[intestacy]] laws of the state.

A party may challenge any aspect of the probate administration, such as a direct challenge to the validity of the will, known as a [[will contest]], a challenge to the status of the person serving as personal representative, a challenge as to the identity of the heirs, and a challenge to whether the personal representative is properly administering the estate. Issues of [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] can be disputed among the potential heirs in intestate estates, especially with the advent of inexpensive [[DNA profiling]] techniques. In some situations, however, even biological heirs can be denied their inheritance rights, while non-biological heirs can be granted inheritance rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dobbin|first1=Ben|title=Woman Denied Jell-O Fortune|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=4447436|accessdate=19 September 2017|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ABC News|date=13 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The personal representative must understand and abide by the fiduciary duties, such as a duty to keep money in interest bearing account and to treat all beneficiaries equally. Not complying with the fiduciary duties may allow interested persons to petition for the removal of the personal representative and hold the personal representative liable for any harm to the estate.

'''Resistance International''' was an international anti-communist organisation that existed between 1983 and 1988. It anticipated and embodied the so-called [[Reagan Doctrine]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id130.htm "The Reagan Doctrine"], chapter from Robert Kagan, ''A Twilight Struggle: American Power and Nicaragua, 1977-1990'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; which took final shape in 1985. Resistance International was set up in France in May 1983 on the initiative of Soviet dissident [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] and [[Armando Valladares]], a representative of the [[Cuban dissident movement]].

"Today few traces remain of the activities of Resistance International", writes Galina Akkerman in a memoir describing her work for writer Vladimir Maximov at the organisation's "tiny office on the Champs Elysée" in Paris. "The internet was still unknown and to restore the history of this organisation I must turn to the few things I can recall".&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazines.russ.ru/continent/2010/146/ak15.html Galina Akkerman, "Vladimir Maximov", ''Kontinent'', No 146, 2010].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==

Vladimir Bukovsky was chosen president and the organisation was run by former Soviet dissidents. Everyday organisation was then in the hands of the executive director [[Vladimir Maximov]], writer and editor of the ''Kontinent'' quarterly.&lt;ref&gt;Robert van Voren, ''On Dissidents and Madness: From the Soviet Union of Brezhnev to the "Soviet Union" of Vladimir Putin'', Rodopi: Amsterdam &amp; New York, 2009, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Galina Akkerman describes how [[Eduard Kuznetsov]] later took over part of Maximov's role and recalls the involvement of Armand Maloumian, a post-war inmate of Stalin's Gulag.&lt;ref&gt; Armand Maloumian, ''And Even Our Tears'', Avon Books: New York 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the members of the International's advisory committee were Cornelia Gerstenmaier, Lord [[Nicholas Bethell]], Winston Churchill Jr, [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], and [[Simon Wiesenthal]]. By 1986 they had been joined by [[Saul Bellow]], [[Bruno Bettleheim]], [[Robert Conquest]] and others.

==Afghanistan, Angola and the USSR==
The aim of the organisation was to coordinate the activities of anti-communist movements in the Socialist bloc and in the Third World and challenge the legitimacy of Communist governments everywhere. In a 1991 interview Bukovsky commented, "We didn't do that much, but the little we did all worked and had a considerable effect."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panorama.ru/gazeta/1-30/p30buk.html "Resistance International", An interview with Vladimir Bukovsky, ''Panorama'', Moscow, December 1991] (in Russian), retrieved 20 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In particular Resistance International directed its efforts towards [[Afghanistan]], where tens of thousands of Soviet troops had been based since the invasion of December 1979. The International organised Radio Free Kabul, providing 25 portable transmitters that served not only as a means of transmitting radio propaganda in local languages, but also as a means of communication between the mujahideen forces. Resistance International helped Soviet deserters and prisoners of war leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0013400229018 "Lord Bethell smuggles two soldiers out of Afghanistan", 11 November 1984, British Universities Film and Video Council]&lt;/ref&gt; To spread information among Soviet forces serving in Afghanistan the organisation issued a newspaper that bore an external resemblance to [[Krasnaya Zvezda]], the daily published by the Soviet Ministry of Defence.

Resistance International was also said to have carried out propaganda work among the Cuban troops deployed in Angola.

With the aid of the [[Solidarity]] movement in Poland, it sent propaganda videos to the USSR concealed in Polish trucks.&lt;ref&gt;These were filmed and edited by Kuznetsov and his wife Larisa Gerstein. See Galina Akkerman, "Vladimir Maximov"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities in Europe==
Between 1985 and 1987 Resistance International organised major events in Western Europe, two in Paris and one in Vienna, to draw attention to the lack of free speech and human rights in the Soviet Union.

The first event was timed to coincide with Mikhail Gorbachev's first visit to Paris in October 1985. As an alternative to the official events of the Soviet leader's visit a large gathering was held at the Grand Palais.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazines.russ.ru/continent/2010/146/ak15.html Galina Akkerman, "Vladimir Maximov", Kontinent, No 146, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second event, an exhibition entitled a "Helsinki Mirror" and a press conference, took place in Vienna from 4 to 6 November 1986 as the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) which produced the 1975 Helsinki Accords was transformed into the permanent [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazines.russ.ru/continent/2010/146/ak15.html Galina Akkerman, "Vladimir Maximov", Kontinent, No 146, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and last major public event of Resistance International was the Paris Forum, "Literature without borders", held in November 1987 and organised jointly by the French Pen Club, Resistance International and the Russian and French editions of the ''Kontinent'' quarterly. "Freedom of speech in the USSR and Eastern Europe", noted Galina Akkerman, "was something more people could agree on than aid for the Contras or the Afghan mujahideen," and forty famous writers attended, including [[Joseph Brodsky]], [[Czeslaw Milosz]] and [[Georgy Vladimov]]. This would prove, in Akkerman's words, to be the "swan song" of Resistance International. It closed down the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazines.russ.ru/continent/2010/146/ak15.html Galina Akkerman, "Vladimir Maximov", Kontinent, No 146, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding public and private==
Resistance International initially had funding from the US Congress (from which it received 6 million dollars in 1983) and from private American foundations. In 1985 the organisation was put on a more serious footing with the establishment of the American Foundation for Resistance International which had a roster of famous names and influential right-wing politicians on its advisory committee (among them [[Saul Bellow]], William F. Buckley Jr, and, later, [[Richard Perle]]), while [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]] served with Bukovsky and [[Albert Jolis]] on its board. For the next three years this body raised funds for Resistance International and expanded the scope of its activities.

'''Ronggo''' was an administrative title used by the Dutch in the [[Dutch East Indies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Dutch East India Company {{!}} european-heritage.org|url = http://european-heritage.org/netherlands/alkmaar/dutch-east-india-company|website = european-heritage.org|accessdate = 2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Indonesia (specifically [[Java]] and [[Borneo]].)

Ronggo of "Afdeeling" Bandjarmasin was held by Kiahi Mas Djaja Samoedra (circa 1899) (EYD or "''advanced spelling''":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What does EYD stand for?|url = http://www.abbreviations.com/EYD|website = www.abbreviations.com|accessdate = 2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiai Mas Jaya Samudera). The region saw much international trade with Asia and the Middle East. After a period of warfare dominated much of the late 1500s to mid 1600s, Portugal controlled the area for a short time.

Following Portuguese control, the Dutch East India Company awarded a monopoly on trade and colonization in the area utilizing an exceptional financial backing, better organization, strategy, weapons and ships, but were still unable to completely dominate the Indonesian spice trade. In the 1800s, the Dutch East India Company dissolved due to bankruptcy and the Netherlands turned it into a nationalized colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Page 2: Indonesia Map / Geography of Indonesia / Map of Indonesia - Worldatlas.com|url = http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/asia/id2.htm#page|website = www.worldatlas.com|accessdate = 2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3130">'''Saltwater soap''', also called '''sailors' soap''', is a [[potassium]]-based [[soap]] for use with [[seawater]]. Inexpensive common regular commercial soap will not lather or dissolve in seawater due to high levels of [[sodium chloride]]  in the water. Similarly, common soap does not work as well as potassium-based soap in hard water where calcium replaces the sodium, making residual insoluble "scum" due to the insolubility  of the soap residue. To be an effective [[cleaning agent]], soap must be able to [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolve]] in [[water]].

Ordinary soap is a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of a [[fatty acid]].&lt;ref&gt;[[IUPAC]]. "[http://goldbook.iupac.org/S05721.html ''IUPAC Gold Book – soap'']" ''Compendium of Chemical Terminology'', 2nd ed. (the "Gold Book"). Compiled by A. D. McNaught and A. Wilkinson. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford (1997). XML on-line corrected version: created by M. Nic, J. Jirat, B. Kosata; updates compiled by A. Jenkins. {{ISBN|0-9678550-9-8}}. {{doi|10.1351/goldbook}}. Accessed 2010-08-09&lt;/ref&gt; Soaps are mainly used as [[surfactant]]s for [[washing]], [[bathing]], and [[housekeeping|cleaning]]. Soaps for cleansing are made by treating vegetable or animal oils and fats with a strongly [[Alkalinity|alkaline]] solution. Fats and oils are composed of [[triglyceride]]s; three molecules of [[fatty acids]] are attached to a single molecule of [[glycerol]].&lt;ref name="Cavitch, Susan Miller 1994"&gt;Cavitch, Susan Miller. ''The Natural Soap Book''. Storey Publishing, 1994 {{ISBN|0-88266-888-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The alkaline solution, which is often called [[lye]] (although the term "lye soap" refers almost exclusively to soaps made with [[sodium hydroxide]]), brings about a [[chemical reaction]] known as [[saponification]]. In this reaction, the triglyceride fats are first [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] into free fatty acids, and then these combine with the alkali to form crude soap: a combination of various soap salts, excess fat or alkali, water, and liberated [[glycerol]] (glycerin).&lt;ref name="Cavitch, Susan Miller 1994"/&gt;

Saltwater soaps use potassium salts as found naturally in plant ashes (hence the element name "potassium" as derived from the term "[[potash]]", for the ashes left in a pot after burning wood or other plant materials), instead of the sodium salts found in commercial lye. Potassium is a [[Alkali metal|alkali metal]] similar to sodium but more active. Similarly to sodium, potassium also can react with long fatty acid tails to make soap molecules. Potassium soaps dissolve and make salt water soap work better than sodium in salt waters such as in seawater. 

In places that do not have fresh water or need to [[Water conservation|conserve it]], cleaning can be done with the use of salt water and saltwater soap.

==Biography==
Sivanxai Phommalath was a small vegetable vendor who sold vegetables grown in her own garden by her house in [[Yommalath District|Yommalath district]], Khammuane province, Laos. She was married with one child. The government of Laos decided to built [[Nam Theun 2 Dam|Nam Theun II dam]] in Yommalath district to generate [[hydroelectricity]]. Her home and land like many of her neighbors were expropriated by the Government of Laos, like many of her neighbors. Those with connections to the government were able to secure good compensation which Sivanxai was not able to do. She received 900 dollars for her piece of land and the government said that it was enough to cover another piece of land she owned near the site. She demanded fair compensation that was market price of the land. She tried to organize a protest near the border of Thailand, which did not work but she was arrested and imprisoned in Thamkhikai. The police accused her of causing public disturbance and was asked to name the government official she meant to meet at the border which she did not know. She was released after being fined 88 dollars. After being released from jail she decided to fight the government and settled down on her second plot, building a house and paying property taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Antoine|first1=Catherine|title=Sivanxai Phommalath (Laos)|url=http://www.womensrights.asia/rfa_sivanxai_phommalath.html|website=www.womensrights.asia|publisher=Women in Human Rights|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commonly accepted determinants ==

[[File:Social Determinants of Health Infoviz.jpg|thumb|Social Determinants of Health Map]]

There is no single definition of the social determinants of health, but there are commonalities, and many governmental and non-governmental organizations recognize that there are social factors which impact the health of individuals.

In 2003, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) Europe suggested that the social determinants of health included:&lt;ref name="WHO Europe"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/98438/e81384.pdf |title=The Social Determinants of Health: The Solid Facts |edition=2nd |format=PDF |year=2003 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] Europe |editor1-first=Richard |editor1-last=Wilkinson |editor2-first=Michael |editor2-last=Marmot |isbn=978-92-890-1371-0}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Psychological stress|Stress]]
* Early life
* [[Social exclusion]]
* Work
* [[Unemployment]]
* [[Social support]]
* [[Addiction]]
* [[Food]]
* [[Transportation]]

In Canada, these social determinants of health have gained wide usage.&lt;ref name=pmid20888059/&gt;

#[[Unemployment]] and [[job security]]

#[[Health care|Health services]]
#[[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] status
#[[Gender]]
#[[Race (human classification)|Race]]
#[[Disability]]

These social determinants of health are related to health outcomes, public policy, and are easily understood by the public to impact health. They tend to cluster together – for example, those living in poverty experience a number of negative health determinants.&lt;ref name=pmid20888059&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.healthpol.2010.08.022 |pmid=20888059 |title=Canada: A land of missed opportunity for addressing the social determinants of health |journal=Health Policy |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=44–58 |year=2011 |last1=Bryant |first1=Toba |last2=Raphael |first2=Dennis |last3=Schrecker |first3=Ted |last4=Labonte |first4=Ronald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health published a report entitled "Closing the Gap in a Generation." This report identified two broad areas of social determinants of health that needed to be addressed.&lt;ref name="WHO CSDH"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241563703_eng.pdf|title=Closing the Gap in a Generation: Health Equity Through Action on the Social Determinants of Health|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|year=2008|isbn=978-92-4-156370-3|format=PDF|author=Commission on Social Determinants of Health|accessdate=2013-03-27}} Pg 2&lt;/ref&gt; The first area was daily [[living conditions]], which included healthy [[physical environment]]s, fair employment and decent work, [[social protection]] across the lifespan, and access to health care. The second major area was distribution of power, money, and resources, including [[health equity|equity]] in health programs, public financing of action on the social determinants, [[economic inequality|economic inequalities]], [[resource depletion]], [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2015-178/ healthy working conditions], [[gender equality|gender equity]], [[political empowerment]], constitution of reserves&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullati|first=Stéphane|last2=Kliegel|first2=Matthias|last3=Widmer|first3=Eric|date=2018-07-30|title=Development of reserves over the life course and onset of vulnerability in later life|url=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-018-0395-3|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|volume=2|issue=8|pages=551–558|doi=10.1038/s41562-018-0395-3|issn=2397-3374}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a balance of power and prosperity of nations.&lt;ref name="WHO CSDH"/&gt;

The 2011 World Conference on Social Determinants of Health brought together delegations from 125 member states and resulted in the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health.  This declaration involved an affirmation that health inequities are unacceptable, and noted that these inequities arise from the societal conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, including early childhood development, education, economic status, employment and decent work, housing environment, and effective prevention and treatment of health problems.&lt;ref name="Rio Declaration"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/sdhconference/declaration/Rio_political_declaration.pdf |title=Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health |format=PDF |year=2011 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |author=World Conference on Social Determinants of Health |accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Centers for Disease Control defines social determinants of health as "life-enhancing resources, such as food supply, housing, economic and social relationships, transportation, education, and health care, whose distribution across populations effectively determines length and quality of life".&lt;ref name="USCDC"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Laura K. |last1=Brennan Ramirez |first2=Elizabeth A. |last2=Baker |first3=Marilyn |last3=Metzler |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dch/programs/healthycommunitiesprogram/tools/pdf/SDOH-workbook.pdf |title=Promoting Health Equity: A Resource to Help Communities Address Social Determinants of Health |format=PDF |year=2008 |publisher=[[United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=May 3, 2015 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include access to care and resources such as food, insurance coverage, income, housing, and transportation.&lt;ref name="USCDC"/&gt;  Social determinants of health influence [[health promotion|health-promoting]] behaviours, and [[health equity]] among the population is not possible without equitable distribution of social determinants among groups.&lt;ref name="USCDC"/&gt;

Steven H. Woolf, MD of the Virginia Commonwealth University Center on Human Needs states, "The degree to which social conditions affect health is illustrated by the association between education and mortality rates".&lt;ref name="Woolf, S. H 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.320 |pmid=19293418 |title=Social Policy as Health Policy |journal=JAMA |volume=301 |issue=11 |pages=1166–9 |year=2009 |last1=Woolf |first1=Steven H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports in 2005 revealed the [[mortality rate]] was 206.3 per 100,000 for adults aged 25 to 64 years with little education beyond high school, but was twice as great (477.6 per 100,000) for those with only a high school education and 3 times as great (650.4 per 100,000) for those less educated.  Based on the data collected, the social conditions such as education, income, and race were dependent on one another, but these social conditions also apply to independent health influences..&lt;ref name="Woolf, S. H 2009"/&gt;

Marmot and Bell of the University College London found that in wealthy countries, income and mortality are correlated as a marker of relative position within society, and this relative position is related to social conditions that are important for health including good [[early childhood development]], access to high quality education, rewarding work with some degree of autonomy, decent housing, and a clean and safe living environment.

Even in the wealthiest countries, there are health inequalities between the rich and the poor.&lt;ref name="WHO Europe"/&gt; Researchers Labonte and Schrecker from the Department of Epidemiology and Community Medicine at the University of Ottawa emphasize that globalization is key to understanding the social determinants of health, and as Bushra (2011) posits, the impacts of globalization are unequal.&lt;ref name="Labonte"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1744-8603-3-6 |pmid=17578569 |pmc=1919362 |title=Globalization and social determinants of health: The role of the global marketplace (part 2 of 3) |journal=Globalization and Health |volume=3 |pages=6 |year=2007 |last1=Labonté |first1=Ronald |last2=Schrecker |first2=Ted }}&lt;/ref&gt; Globalization has caused an uneven distribution of wealth and power both within and across national borders, and where and in what situation a person is born has an enormous impact on their health outcomes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found significant differences among developed nations in [[ICU scoring systems|health status indicators]] such as life expectancy, [[infant mortality]], [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of disease, and death from injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.

These inequalities may exist in the context of the [[health care system]], or in broader social approaches.  According to the WHO's Commission on Social Determinants of Health, access to health care is essential for equitable health, and it argued that health care should be a common good rather than a market [[commodity]].&lt;ref name="WHO CSDH"/&gt; However, there is substantial variation in health care systems and coverage from country to country.  The Commission also calls for government action on such things as access to clean water and safe, equitable working conditions, and it notes that dangerous working conditions exist even in some wealthy countries.&lt;ref name=" WHO CSDH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=Michael|title=Undocumented Status as a Social Determinant of Occupational Safety and Health: The Workers’ Perspective.|journal=Am.

== Theoretical approaches ==

The UK ''Black'' and ''The Health Divide'' reports considered two primary mechanisms for understanding how social determinants influence health: cultural/behavioral and [[materialist]]/structuralist&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, P., Davidson, N., &amp; Whitehead, M. (Eds.). (1992). Inequalities in Health: the Black Report and the Health Divide. New York: Penguin.{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural/behavioral explanation is that individuals' behavioral choices (e.g., tobacco and alcohol use, diet, physical activity, etc.) were responsible for their development and deaths from a variety of diseases. However, both the ''Black'' and ''Health Divide'' reports found that behavioral choices are determined by one's material conditions of life, and these behavioral [[risk factors]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;account for a relatively small proportion of variation in the incidence and death from various diseases.

The materialist/structuralist explanation emphasizes the people's material living conditions. These conditions include availability of resources to access the [[amenities]] of life, [[working conditions]], and quality of available food and housing among others. Within this view, three frameworks have been developed to explain how social determinants influence health.&lt;ref&gt;Bartley, M. (2003). Understanding Health Inequalities. Oxford UK: Polity Press.{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These frameworks are: (a) materialist; (b) neo-materialist; and (c) [[psychosocial]] comparison. The materialist view explains how living conditions – and the social determinants of health that constitute these living conditions – shape health. The neo-materialist explanation extends the materialist analysis by asking how these living conditions occur. The psychosocial comparison explanation considers whether people compare themselves to others and how these comparisons affect health and wellbeing.

A nation's wealth is a strong indicator of the health of its population. Within nations, however, individual [[socio-economic]] position is a powerful predictor of health.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;Graham, H. (2007). Unequal Lives: Health and Socioeconomic Inequalities. New York: Open University Press.{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Material conditions of life determine health by influencing the quality of individual development, family life and interaction, and community environments. Material conditions of life lead to differing likelihood of physical ([[infections]], [[malnutrition]], [[chronic disease]], and [[injuries]]), developmental (delayed or impaired [[Cognitive development|cognitive]], [[Personality development|personality]], and [[social development]]), educational ([[learning disabilities]], poor learning, early school leaving), and social ([[socialization]], preparation for work, and family life) problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shaw |first1=M. |last2=Dorling |first2=D. |last3=Gordon |first3=D. |last4=Smith |first4=G. D. |year=1999 |title=The Widening Gap: Health Inequalities and Policy in Britain |location=Bristol, UK |publisher=The Policy Press}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Material conditions of life also lead to differences in psychosocial stress.&lt;ref name="MarmotWilkinson2005pp6-30"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198565895.003.02 |chapter=Social organization, stress, and health |title=Social Determinants of Health |pages=6–30 |year=2005 |last1=Marmot |first1=Michael |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Richard G. |isbn=978-0-19-856589-5 |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Marmot |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Wilkinson }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the fight-or-flight reaction is chronically elicited in response to constant threats to income, housing, and food availability, the [[immune system]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;is weakened, [[insulin resistance]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;is increased, and lipid and clotting disorders appear more frequently.

The materialist approach offers insight into the sources of health inequalities among individuals and nations. Adoption of health-threatening behaviours is also influenced by material deprivation and stress.&lt;ref name="MarmotWilkinson2005pp224-37"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198565895.003.11 |chapter=Social patterning of individual health behaviours: The case of cigarette smoking |title=Social Determinants of Health |pages=224–37 |year=2005 |last1=Marmot |first1=Michael |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Richard G. |isbn=978-0-19-856589-5 |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Marmot |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Wilkinson }}&lt;/ref&gt;Environments influence whether individuals take up tobacco, use alcohol, consume poor diets, and have low levels of physical activity.

The neo-materialist approach is concerned with how nations, regions, and cities differ on how economic and other resources are distributed among the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.320.7243.1200 |pmid=10784551 |pmc=1127589 |title=Income inequality and mortality: Importance to health of individual income, psychosocial environment, or material conditions |journal=BMJ |volume=320 |issue=7243 |pages=1200–4 |year=2000 |last1=Lynch |first1=J. W |last2=Smith |first2=G. D. |last3=Kaplan |first3=G. A. |last4=House |first4=J. S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This distribution of resources can vary widely from country to country. The neo-materialist view focuses on both the social determinants of health and the societal factors that determine the distribution of these social determinants, and especially emphasizes how resources are distributed among members of a society. 

The social comparison approach holds that the social determinants of health play their role through citizens' interpretations of their standings in the [[social hierarchy]].&lt;ref name=KawachiKennedy2002&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kawachi |first1=I. |last2=Kennedy |first2=B. |year=2002 |title=The Health of Nations: Why Inequality Is Harmful to Your Health |location=New York |publisher=New Press}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two mechanisms by which this occurs. At the individual level, the perception and experience of one's status in unequal societies lead to stress and poor health. Feelings of shame, worthlessness, and envy can lead to harmful effects upon neuro-endocrine, autonomic and metabolic, and immune systems.&lt;ref name="MarmotWilkinson2005pp6-30"/&gt; Comparisons to those of a higher social class can also lead to attempts to alleviate such feelings by overspending, taking on additional employment that threaten health, and adopting health-threatening coping behaviours such as overeating and using alcohol and tobacco.&lt;ref name=KawachiKennedy2002/&gt; At the communal level, widening and strengthening of hierarchy weakens [[social cohesion]], which is a determinant of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.314.7086.1037 |pmid=9112854 |pmc=2126438 |title=Socioeconomic determinants of health : Health and social cohesion: Why care about income inequality? |journal=BMJ |volume=314 |issue=7086 |pages=1037–40 |year=1997 |last1=Kawachi |first1=I. |last2=Kennedy |first2=B. P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The social comparison approach directs attention to the psychosocial effects of public policies that weaken the social determinants of health. However, these effects may be secondary to how societies distribute material resources and provide security to its citizens, which are described in the materialist and neo-materialist approaches.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Life-course perspective ==

Life-course approaches emphasize the accumulated effects of experience across the life span in understanding the maintenance of health and the onset of disease. The economic and social conditions – the social determinants of health – under which individuals live their lives have a cumulative effect upon the probability of developing any number of diseases, including heart disease and stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blane |first=D. |year=2006 |chapter=The life course, the social gradient and health |editor1-first=M.

[[Birth weight|Low birth weight]], for instance, is a reliable predictor of incidence of cardiovascular disease and adult-onset diabetes in later life. Nutritional deprivation during childhood has lasting health effects as well.

Pathway effects are experiences that set individuals onto trajectories that influence health, well-being, and competence over the life course. As one example, children who enter school with delayed vocabulary are set upon a path that leads to lower educational expectations, poor employment prospects, and greater likelihood of illness and disease across the lifespan. Deprivation associated with poor-quality neighbourhoods, schools, and housing sets children off on paths that are not conducive to health and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Staying Alive: Critical Perspectives on Health, Illness, and Health Care|last=Raphael|first=Dennis|publisher=Canadian Scholars’ Press|year=2010|isbn=9781551303703|location=Canada|pages=159|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Chronic stress and health==

[[Stress (psychological)|Stress]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;is hypothesized to be a major influence in the social determinants of health. There is a relationship between experience of chronic stress and negative health outcomes.&lt;ref name=Gouin&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1559827610395467 |title=Chronic Stress, Immune Dysregulation, and Health |journal=American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=476–85 |year=2011 |last1=Gouin |first1=J.-P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship is explained through both direct and indirect effects of chronic stress on health outcomes.

The direct relationship between stress and health outcomes is the effect of stress on human physiology. The long term stress hormone, [[cortisol]], is believed to be the key driver in this relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.25 |pmid=17201569 |title=If it goes up, must it come down?

Stress can also be seen to have an indirect effect on health status. One way this happens is due to the strain on the psychological resources of the stressed individual. Chronic stress is common in those of a low socio-economic status, who are having to balance worries about financial security, how they will feed their families, housing status, and many other concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/phe/phs022 |title=Behavior Change or Empowerment: On the Ethics of Health-Promotion Strategies |journal=Public Health Ethics |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=140–53 |year=2012 |last1=Tengland |first1=P.-A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, individuals with these kinds of worries may lack the emotional resources to adopt positive health behaviours. Chronically stressed individuals may therefore be less likely to prioritize their health.

In addition to this, the way that an individual responds to stress can influence their health status. Often, individuals responding to chronic stress will develop potentially positive or negative coping behaviors. People who cope with stress through positive behaviors such as exercise or social connections may not be as affected by the relationship between stress and health, whereas those with a coping style more prone to over-consumption (i.e. [[emotional eating]], drinking, smoking or drug use) are more likely to be see negative health effects of stress.&lt;ref name=Cwikel /&gt;

The detrimental effects of stress on health outcomes are hypothesised to partly explain why countries that have high levels of income inequality have poorer health outcomes compared to more equal countries.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;Wilkinson, R. &amp; Pickett, K. (2009) The spirit level : why more equal societies almost always do better. London: Allen Lane.{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkinson and Picket hypothesise in their book [[The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better|The Spirit Level]] that the stressors associated with low social status are amplified in societies where others are clearly far better off.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; 

==Improving health conditions worldwide==
Reducing the health gap requires that governments build systems that allow a healthy standard of living for every resident. 

=== Interventions ===
Three common interventions for improving social determinant outcomes as identified by the WHO are education, social security and urban development. However, evaluation of interventions has been difficult due to the nature of the interventions, their impact and the fact that the interventions strongly affect children's health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;World Health Organization (2013).

In addition, there is a fair amount of evidence to prove that external urban development interventions such as transportation improvements or improved walkability of neighborhoods (which is highly effective in developed countries) can have health benefits&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

[http://www.clpha.org/EconomicImpact ''The Economic Impact of'' ''Public Housing: Ongoing Investment with Wide Reaching Returns'']. Council of Large Public Housing Authorities.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Commission on Social Determinants of Health made recommendations in 2005 for action to promote health equity based on three principles: "improve the circumstances in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age; tackle the inequitable distribution of power, money, and resources, the structural drivers of conditions of daily life, globally, nationally, and locally; and measure the problem, evaluate action, and expand the knowledge base."&lt;ref name="MarmotMichael2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marmot|first1=Michael G.|last2=Bell|first2=Ruth|year=2009|title=Action on Health Disparities in the United States|journal=JAMA|volume=301|issue=11|pages=1169–71|doi=10.1001/jama.2009.363|pmid=19293419}}&lt;/ref&gt; These recommendations would involve providing resources such as quality education, decent housing, access to affordable health care, access to healthy food, and safe places to exercise for everyone despite gaps in affluence. Expansion of knowledge of the social determinants of health, including among healthcare workers, can improve the quality and standard of care for people who are marginalized, poor or living in developing nations by preventing early death and disability while working to improve quality of life.&lt;ref name="Farmer2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farmer|first1=Paul E.|last2=Nizeye|first2=Bruce|last3=Stulac|first3=Sara|last4=Keshavjee|first4=Salmaan|year=2006|title=Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine|journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=3|issue=10|pages=e449|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449|pmc=1621099|pmid=17076568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges of measuring value of interventions ===
Many economic studies have been conducted to measure the effectiveness and value of social determinant interventions but are unable to accurately reflect effects on public health due to the multi-faceted nature of the topic. While neither [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness]] nor [[Cost–utility analysis|cost-utility analysis]] is able to be used on social determinant interventions, cost-benefit analysis is able to better capture the effects of an intervention on multiple sectors of the economy. For example, tobacco interventions have shown to decrease tobacco use, but also prolong lifespans, increasing lifetime healthcare costs and is therefore marked as a failed intervention by cost-effectiveness, but not cost-benefit. Another issue with research in this area is that most of the current scientific papers focus on rich, developed countries, and there is a lack of research in developing countries&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

Policy changes that affect children also present the challenge that it takes a significant amount of time to gather this type of data. In addition, policies to reduce [[child poverty]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;are particularly important, as elevated stress hormones in children interfere with the development of brain circuitry and connections, causing long term chemical damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=G.

== Public policy ==

The Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health embraces a transparent, participatory model of policy development that, among other things, addresses the social determinants of health leading to persistent health inequalities for indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="Rio Declaration"/&gt; In 2017, citing the need for accountability for the pledges made by countries in the Rio Political Declaration on Social Detereminants of Health, the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund called for the monitoring of intersectoral interventions on the social detereminants of health that improve health equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2471/BLT.16.184622 |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/11/16-184622/en/ |title=The need to monitor actions on the social determinants of health |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=95 |issue=11 |pages=784-787 |year=2017 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Valentine |first2=Nicole |last3=Rasanathan |first3=Kumanan |last4=Hosseinpoor |first4=Ahmad Reza |last5=Neira |first5=Maria }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The United States Department of Health and Human Services includes social determinants in its model of population health, and one of its missions is to strengthen policies which are backed by the best available evidence and knowledge in the field &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://healthypeople.gov/2020/Consortium/HP2020Framework.pdf |title=Healthy People 2020 Framework |format=PDF |year=2010 |publisher=United States Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=2013-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215084008/http://healthypeople.gov/2020/Consortium/HP2020Framework.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Social determinants of health do not exist in a vacuum. Their quality and availability to the population are usually a result of public policy decisions made by governing authorities. For example, early life is shaped by availability of sufficient material resources that assure adequate educational opportunities, food and housing among others.  Much of this has to do with the employment security and the quality of working conditions and wages. The availability of quality, regulated childcare is an especially important policy option in support of early life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Gøsta |last1=Esping-Andersen |chapter=A Child-Centred Social Investment Strategy |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=OaxGR8yrm10C&amp;pg=PA26 |pages=26–67 |editor1-first=Gøsta |editor1-last=Esping-Andersen |year=2002 |title=Why We Need a New Welfare State |isbn=978-0-19-925642-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are not issues that usually come under individual control but rather they are socially constructed conditions which require institutional responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=Michael|last2=Check|first2=Pietra|last3=Eggerth|first3=Donald|last4=Tonda|first4=Josana|title=Improving Occupational Safety and Health Among Mexican Immigrant Workers:|journal=Public Health Reports|date=2013|volume=128|issue=Suppl 3|pages=33–38|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258248322_Improving_Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Among_Mexican_Immigrant_Workers_A_Binational_Collaboration}}&lt;/ref&gt; A policy-oriented approach places such findings within a broader policy context. In this context, [[Health in All Policies]] has seen as a response to incorporate health and health equity into all public policies as means to foster synergy between sectors and ultimately promote health.

Yet it is not uncommon to see governmental and other authorities individualize these issues. Governments may view early life as being primarily about parental behaviours towards their children.  They then focus upon promoting better parenting, assist in having parents read to their children, or urge schools to foster exercise among children rather than raising the amount of financial or housing resources available to families. Indeed, for every social determinant of health, an individualized manifestation of each is available. There is little evidence to suggest the efficacy of such approaches in improving the health status of those most vulnerable to illness in the absence of efforts to modify their adverse living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raphael |first=D. |year=2001 |title=Inequality is Bad for our Hearts: Why Low Income and Social Exclusion are Major Causes of Heart Disease in Canada |isbn=0-9689444-0-X}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team of the Cochrane Collaboration conducted the first comprehensive systematic review of the health impact of unconditional cash transfers, as an increasingly common up-stream, structural social determinant of health. The review of 21 studies, including 16 randomized controlled trials, found that unconditional cash transfers may not improve health services use. However, they lead to a large, clinically meaningful reduction in the likelihood of being sick by an estimated 27%. Unconditional cash transfers may also improve food security and dietary diversity. Children in recipient families are more likely to attend school, and the cash transfers may increase money spent on health care.&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Unconditional cash transfers for reducing poverty and vulnerabilities: effect on use of health services and health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=11 |pages=CD011135 |year=2017 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Liu |first2=Sze |last3=Walter |first3=Stefan  |last4=Pabayo |first4=Roman |last5=Saith |first5=Ruhi |last6=Lhachimi |first6=Stefan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the recommendations by the Commission on the Social Determinants of Health is expanding knowledge – particularly to health care workers.&lt;ref name="Farmer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farmer|first1=Paul E.|last2=Nizeye|first2=Bruce|last3=Stulac|first3=Sara|last4=Keshavjee|first4=Salmaan|year=2006|title=Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine|journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=3|issue=10|pages=e449|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449|pmc=1621099|pmid=17076568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not addressed by the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health, sexual orientation and gender identity are increasingly recognized as social determinants of health.&lt;ref name=pmid25602894&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=25602894 |title=The case for the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health to address gender identity |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=e58-62 |year=2015 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Veale |first2=Jaimie |doi=10.2105/ajph.2014.302373 |pmc=4330845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sufan movement''' (肅反, "against counterrevolutionaries") was a political campaign against political opponents in the [[People's Republic of China]] under [[Mao Zedong]].&lt;ref&gt;Lieberthal, Kenneth. (2003). Governing China: From Revolution to Reform, W.W. Norton &amp; Co.; Second Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "sufan" is short for "肅清暗藏的反革命分子", and can roughly be taken as referring to a 'purge' of hidden counterrevolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/  Lin Yutang], 肅  (''su'') can be translated as 整肅 [zheng3su4]2, v.t., (in communist China) to [[purge]].&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the earliest Chinese communist Sufan had been initiated by [[Zhang Guotao]] in 1932. The Sufan movement lasted from August 1955 to late 1956.

On 1 July 1955, the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee issued a "Directive on launching a struggle to cleanse out hidden counter-revolutionary elements" (關於開展鬥爭肅 清暗藏的反革命分子的指示). On 25 August 1955，it issued "The directive on the thorough [[purge]] and cleansing  of hidden counter revolutionaries" (關於徹底肅清暗藏反革命分子的指示). The targets of directives like these were individuals inside the communist party, the government bureaucracy, and military personnel. This was in contrast to the earlier [[Zhen Fan]] movement that had mainly targeted former [[Kuomintang]] personnel.

==The targets of Sufan==

The ''People's Daily'', in an attempt to provide justification for the purge, reported that ten percent of Communist Party members were secret traitors and needed to be purged. This number appears to have been taken as a quota for the number of arrests that needed to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Luc Domenach, "Chine: L'archipel oublie" (Paris: Fayard, 1992) , p 118&lt;/ref&gt;

There were three categories of Sufan targets:
#Ex-Kuomintang personnel, regardless of war captive or surrender.
#Anyone with landlord or wealthy families.
#Students and literati.{{dubious|date=February 2012}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In many if not all parts of China, the Sufan movement ended in late 1956. Jean-Louis Margolin writes in ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'' that one source indicates 81,000 arrests during the campaign (which he claims is rather modest), while another gives 770,000 deaths. He concludes that there is no way to determine which is accurate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephane Courtois]], et al. ''[[The Black Book of Communism]].'' [[Harvard University Press]], 1999. {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}} p. 485&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Swedish Customs''' ({{lang-sv|'''Tullverket'''}}, literally "{{lang|en|Customs Administration}}") is the [[customs|customs service]] of Sweden.  It is a department of the [[Government of Sweden]]. It is one of the oldest governmental agencies in Sweden, as it was founded in 1636. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = tullverket|title = Swedish Customs Search Dog Program|date = 2014-11-03|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPnT46JY6Hs|accessdate = 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = tullverket|title = Tullverkets sökhundverksamhet|date = 2014-09-04|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFa3I_0x_L8|accessdate = 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also Sweden's ''de facto'' [[border guard]].

==History==
Customs duties have existed in Sweden since the twelfth century, and the current organisation was created in 1636. During this period, the Swedish administration was being developed as Sweden was then a [[great power]]. The first Collector-General or Head of Customs was {{lang|sv|Mårten Augustinsson}}.&lt;ref name="SCS history"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tullverket.se/en/startpage/aboutswedishcustoms/swedishcustomsthenandnow.4.3d12a7ea116fc2899518000172.html |title= Swedish Customs then and now |work= About Swedish Customs |publisher= Swedish Customs Service |language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Duty (economics)|Customs duties]], known as "fiscal tolls", were first introduced to raise revenue for the state. Other tolls were introduced later to protect Swedish industry, so-called "[[protectionism|protective tariffs]]". In earlier times, most goods were [[Shipping|transported by sea]]. Vessels arriving in Sweden had to pass through the "Great Sea Toll" where customs duties were paid. There was also a domestic toll, known as the "Little Toll". In the case of the Little Toll, Swedes were forced to pay duty on goods they brought into towns to sell, an important source of income for the [[Swedish monarchy]].&lt;ref name="SCS history"/&gt;

In line with the arrival of duties, so came the rise of [[smuggling]]. Different goods have been smuggled at different times. From the 18th Century to the mid 19th Century, it was common to smuggle [[cloth]]. This was because the government was keen to encourage a textiles industry in Sweden and introduced customs duties and an import ban to prevent foreign cloth coming into the country. In the period between the two world wars, 1920-1939, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] was the item most smuggled. From the 1960s [[drug smuggling]] started to become a problem in Sweden, and remains one today.&lt;ref name="SCS history"/&gt;

Another clear trend is the growing trade with other countries with the aid of new technology, such as the internet. Goods ordered from countries outside the EU through the internet are also subject to duty and other charges.&lt;ref name="SCS history"/&gt;

Upon joining the [[European Union]] in 1995, Sweden also joined the [[EU customs union]], which means the customs regulations are standardised throughout the EU.&lt;ref name="SCS history"/&gt;  The joint customs union is slightly different from that of the  [[Schengen Area]] covering free-travel.

==Current role==

Approximately 75 million travellers, ships, containers and vehicles cross Sweden's frontiers every year.&lt;ref name="SCS info"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tullverket.se/en/startpage/aboutswedishcustoms/preventingwhatisillegal.4.3d12a7ea116fc2899518000140.html |title= Preventing what is illegal |work= About Swedish Customs |publisher= Swedish Customs Service |language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish Customs works in the midst of this flow of goods and people.

The work of Swedish Customs within the law-enforcement field extends across the entire chain of a criminal investigation, from intelligence and checks at the customs channel to a completed preliminary investigation. Border protection officers, customs investigators and customs prosecutors work together to combat criminal activity. Customs officers have the right to [[stop and search]] individuals, interview, investigate and to [[Search and seizure|search]] premises.&lt;ref name="SCS info"/&gt; Customs officers can also be trained to be a Search Dog handler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=tullverket|title=Swedish Customs Search Dog Program|date=2014-11-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPnT46JY6Hs|accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;When the dog retires, at about 10 years of age, the Customs Officer is offered the dog as a gift, and then can continue, either as a dog handler with another dog, a dog handling instructor, or a regular customs officer.

'''Synarchism''' generally means "joint rule" or "harmonious rule". Beyond this general definition, both ''synarchism'' and '''''synarchy''''' have been used to denote rule by a secret [[elite]] in [[Vichy France]], Italy, China, Hong Kong and Mexico.&lt;ref name="Parekh 2008"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Parekh, Rupal | title = WPP'S 'Synarchy' Name Choice Sparks Sneers | year = 2008 | url = http://adage.com/agencynews/article?article_id=127164 | accessdate=2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The earliest recorded use of the term ''synarchy'' is attributed to [[Thomas Stackhouse]] (1677–1752), an English clergyman who used the word in his ''New History of the Holy Bible from the Beginning of the World to the Establishment of Christianity'' (published in two folio volumes in 1737). The attribution can be found in the [[Webster's Dictionary]] (the American Dictionary of the English Language, published by [[Noah Webster]] in 1828). Webster's definition for ''synarchy'' is limited entirely to "joint rule or [[sovereignty]]". The word is derived from the Greek stems ''syn'' meaning "with" or "together" and ''archy'' meaning "rule".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1828-dictionary.com/d/word/synarchy Synarchy entry on ''Noah Webster's 1828 American Dictionary'' web edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most substantial early use of the word ''synarchy'' comes from the writings of [[Alexandre Saint-Yves d'Alveydre]] (1842–1909), who used the term in his book ''La France vraie'' to describe what he believed was the ideal [[form of government]].&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Yves d'Alveydre, ''La France vraie'' (Paris: Calmann Lévy, 1887).&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to the emergence of [[anarchist]] ideologies and movements, Saint-Yves elaborated a political formula which he believed would lead to a harmonious society. He defended social differentiation and hierarchy with collaboration between social classes, transcending conflict between social and economic groups: synarchy, as opposed to [[anarchy]]. Specifically, Saint-Yves envisioned a [[Federal Europe]] (as well as all the states it has integrated) with a [[corporatism|corporatist]] government composed of three [[Council of State|councils]], one for [[academia]], one for the [[judiciary]], and one for [[chamber of commerce|commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;André Nataf, ''The Wordsworth Dictionary of the Occult'' (Wordsworth Editions Ltd; 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rule by a secret elite==
Some [[conspiracy theorists]] (especially in the French-speaking and Spanish-speaking world) use the word ''synarchy'' to describe a [[Shadow government (conspiracy)|shadow government]] or [[deep state]], a form of government where political power effectively rests with a secret [[elite]], in contrast to an "[[oligarchy]]" where the elite is or could be known by the public.&lt;ref name="Patton &amp; Robin Mackness 2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patton, Guy |author2=Mackness, Robin | title = Web of Gold: The Secret History of Sacred Treasures | publisher = Sidgwick &amp; Jackson | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-283-06344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Vichy France===
According to former [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] officer [[William L. Langer|William Langer]],&lt;ref&gt;''Our Vichy Gamble'', Alfred A Knopf, New York, 1947 {{pn|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; some French industrial and banking interests

&lt;blockquote&gt;even before the war, had turned to Nazi Germany and had looked to Hitler as the savior of Europe from Communism. These people were as good fascists as any in Europe. Many of them had extensive and intimate business relations with German interests and were still dreaming of a new system of "synarchy", which meant government of Europe on fascist principles by an international brotherhood of financiers and industrialists.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This theory allegedly originated with the discovery of a document called ''Pacte Synarchique'' following the death (May 19, 1941) of [[Jean Coutrot]], former member of [[Groupe X-Crise]], on May 15, 1941. According to this document, a ''Mouvement Synarchique d'Empire'' had been founded in 1922, with the aim of abolishing [[parliamentarianism]] and replacing it with synarchy. This led to the belief that [[La Cagoule]], a far-right organisation, was the armed branch of French synarchism, and that some important members of the [[Vichy Regime]] were synarchists. The Vichy government ordered an investigation, leading to the ''Rapport Chavin''&lt;ref&gt;Henry Chavin, ''Rapport confidentiel sur la société secrète polytechnicienne dite Mouvement synarchique d'Empire (MSE) ou Convention synarchique révolutionnaire'', 1941&lt;/ref&gt; but no evidence for the existence of the ''Mouvement Synarchiste d'Empire'' was found. Most of the presumed synarchists were either associated with the [[Banque Worms]] or with Groupe X-Crise; they were close to Admiral [[François Darlan]] (Vichy prime minister 1941–1942), and this has led to the belief{{by whom?|date=October 2016}} that synarchists had engineered the military defeat of France for the profit of Banque Worms.&lt;ref&gt;Annie Lacroiz-Riz, ''Le choix de la défaite: Les élites françaises dans les années 1930'', [[Armand Colin]], 2006. {{ISBN|978-2-200-26784-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This belief system has been dismissed as a "work of a paranoid imagination which wove together the histories of three disparate groups of activists, creating a conspiracy among them where none existed".&lt;ref&gt;Richard F. Kuisel, ''The Legend of the Vichy Synarchy'' (French Historical Studies, Vol. 6, No. 3; Spring, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} suspect that the ''Pacte Synarchique'' was a [[hoax]] created by some members of La Cagoule to weaken Darlan and his technocrats.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Dard, ''La synarchie, le mythe du complot permanent'', Paris, Perrin, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few{{quantify|date=October 2016}} far-left historians defend the idea that the synarchy existed.&lt;ref&gt;

==Other uses==

===China===
[[Harvard]] historian and [[sinology|sinologist]] [[John K. Fairbank]] used the word ''synarchy'' in his 1953 book ''Trade and Diplomacy on the China Coast: The Opening of the Treaty Ports, 1842–1854'', and in later writings, to describe the mechanisms of government under the [[Qing dynasty]] in [[China]]. Fairbank's synarchy is a form of joint rule by co-opting existing Manchu and Han Chinese elites and bringing the foreign powers into the system and legitimizing them through a schedule of rituals and tributes that gave them a stake in the Qing dynasty rule. He believed that the Qing, who were considered outside rulers because of their Manchu origins, developed this strategy out of necessity because they did not have a strong political base in China. Not all historians of China find this persuasive, but it is a {{According to whom|respected|date=November 2016}}, mainstream view.&lt;ref&gt;John King Fairbank, ''Trade and Diplomacy on the China Coast:  The Opening of the Treaty Ports, 1842-1854'', (Harvard University Press, 1953), 462–468&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Synarchy under the Treaties", ''Chinese Thought and Institutions'', John K. Fairbank, ed. (University of Chicago Press, 1957), 204–231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/chinesehistory/pgp/fairbank.htm Review of ''Trade and Diplomacy on the China Coast'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Hu Jintao, proclaimed the "[[Harmonious Society]]" as a policy goal of the [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]].

===Hong Kong===
The term is also used by some political scientists to describe the [[Colonial Hong Kong|British colonial government in Hong Kong]] (1842–1997). [[Ambrose King]], in his 1975 paper ''Administrative Absorption of Politics in Hong Kong'', described colonial Hong Kong's administration as "elite consensual government". In it, he claimed, any coalition of elites or forces capable of challenging the legitimacy of Hong Kong's administrative structure would be co-opted by the existing apparatus through the appointment of leading political activists, business figures and other elites to oversight committees, by granting them [[British honours system|British honours]], and by bringing them into elite institutions like Hong Kong's horse racing clubs. He called this ''synarchy'', by extension of Fairbank's use of the word.

===Mexican synarchism===
{{main|Mexican synarchism}}
''Synarchy'' is also the name of the ideology of a political movement in [[Mexico]] dating from the 1930s. In Mexico, it was historically a movement of the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[extreme right]], in some ways akin to [[fascism]], violently opposed to the [[Populism|populist]] and [[secularist]] policies of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|revolutionary]] (PNR, PRM, and PRI) governments that ruled Mexico from 1929 to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lucas |first=Jeffrey Kent | title=The Rightward Drift of Mexico’s Former Revolutionaries: The Case of Antonio Díaz Soto y Gama |year=2010 |publisher=Lewiston, NY: [[Edwin Mellen Press]] |isbn=978-0-7734-3665-7 |pages=207–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Synarchist Union]] ''(Unión Nacional Sinarquista,'' UNS) was founded in May 1937 by a group of Catholic political activists led by José Antonio Urquiza, who was murdered in April 1938, and [[Salvador Abascal]]. In 1946, a faction of the movement loyal to deposed leader [[Manuel Torres Bueno]]  regrouped as the [[Popular Force Party]] (Partido Fuerza Popular). Synarchism revived as a political movement in the 1970s through the [[Mexican Democratic Party]] (PDM),&lt;ref&gt;A. Riding, ''Mexico: Inside the Volcano'', Coronet Books, 1989, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; whose candidate, Ignacio González Gollaz, polled 1.8 percent of the vote at the 1982 presidential election. In 1988 [[Gumersindo Magaña]] polled a similar proportion, but the party then suffered a split, and, in 1992, lost its registration as a [[political party]]. It was dissolved in 1996.

There are now two organisations, both calling themselves the Unión Nacional Sinarquista, one apparently right-wing in orientation,&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027132521/http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Senate/9136/ National Synarchist Union (Website of the right-wing UNS)]&lt;/ref&gt; the other apparently left-wing.{{According to whom|date=November 2016}} [[Carlos María Abascal Carranza|Carlos Abascal]], son of [[Salvador Abascal]], was Mexico's Secretary of the Interior during [[Vicente Fox]]'s presidency. Many ''sinarquistas'' are now militant in the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]], PAN, of former presidents Vicente Fox (2000–2006) and [[Felipe Calderon]] (2006–2012).

'''''The 100-Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating''''' (or '''''Plenty: One Man, One Woman, and a Raucous Year of Eating Locally''''') is a non-fiction book written by Canadian writers Alisa Smith and [[J.B. MacKinnon]]. In the book, the authors recount their experiences, including motivations and challenges, on restricting their diet, for one year, to include only foods grown within 100 miles of their residence. Beginning in March 2005, with little preparation the urban couple began only purchasing foods with ingredients they knew were all from within 100 miles. Finding little in grocery stores, they relied on [[farmers' market]]s and visits to local farms. Staples in their diet included [[seafood]], chicken, [[root vegetable]], berries, and [[Maize|corn]]. They lacked cooking oils, rice, and sugar. They preserved foods for use in the winter but ended with extra supplies.

The couple first wrote about the experience in articles for the online magazine ''[[The Tyee]]''. The popularity of the articles led to a book deal. In the book, Smith and MacKinnon each write alternate chapters, 12 in total. The first chapter is written by MacKinnon and focuses on the first month of their experience. They write in the first person as a memoir that explores their own dietary experiences and personal feelings.

In the Canadian market, the book spent five weeks on ''[[Maclean's]]'' nonfiction bestseller list. The book spent 20 weeks on ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'s'' nonfiction bestseller list.The authors won the Roderick Haig-Brown Regional Prize from the British Columbia Booksellers Association for the best contribution to the enjoyment and understanding of British Columbia. The 100-mile diet concept, along with advocates of [[local food]], were covered by media across North America. In 2009, [[Food Network (Canada)|Food Network Canada]] aired ''[[The 100 Mile Challenge]]'', a television series co-created by MacKinnon and Smith and based on the book.

==Background==
Alisa Smith and J. B. MacKinnon's idea of local eating began while visiting their cabin in northern [[British Columbia]] in August 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Pamela |last = Irving |title = Worldwide phenomenon began with one simple meal |work = [[Edmonton Journal]] |page = E10 |date = 10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their food supplies were nearly exhausted so to feed their dinner guests they scrounged the surrounding land for food. Their dinner of [[Dolly Varden trout]], wild mushrooms, dandelion leaves, apples, sour cherries, and rose hips, along with potatoes and garlic from the garden, so impressed the couple that once back home, in their [[Kitsilano]] apartment in [[Vancouver]], they pursued the idea of eating only local food.&lt;ref name=Murrills&gt;{{cite news |first = Angela |last = Murrills |title = Alisa Smith and J.B.

They began the diet symbolically on the first day of spring, March 21.&lt;ref name=Giese&gt;{{cite news |first = Rachel |last = Giese |title = Home cooking: Alisa Smith and J.B.

The couple, both in their 30s, each had experience in writing: Smith as a freelance journalist who had taught non-fiction writing, and MacKinnon as the author of the [[Charles Taylor Prize|award-winning]] historical non-fiction book ''Dead Man in Paradise'' and a past editor of ''[[Adbusters]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=Simonds&gt;{{cite news |first = Merilyn |last = Simonds |title = Food for thought about what we eat |work = [[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |location = Montreal |date = 5 May 2007 |page = J6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were overwhelmed by the response, first from other [[locavore]]s and then from local and international news media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Tracy |last = Loew |title = Couple think globally by eating locally |work = [[USA Today]] |url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2006-06-09-100-mile-diet_x.htm |accessdate=2008-08-23 |date = 6 September 2006 |page = D5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven articles were published in ''The Tyee'' series over the year, plus an additional four articles afterwards, between August 2006 and May 2007. They launched an independent website, 100milediet.org, in April 2006 and began writing the book. [[Random House]] published the hardcover version on 12 March 2007 in Canada as ''The 100 Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating'' and on 24 April in the United States as ''Plenty: One Man, One Woman, and a Raucous Year of Eating Locally''. The [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] was released in Canada by Random House's Vintage Canada imprint on 2 October and in the United States by the [[Three Rivers Press]] imprint on 22 April 2008.

==Content==
The book consists of twelve chapters, plus an Epilogue and an Acknowledgements section at the end. Smith and MacKinnon individually write alternating chapters, each of which covers one month from March 2005 to February 2006. In the first chapter MacKinnon tells how his idea for the 100-mile diet began and Smith agrees to try it for one year. They begin symbolically on the first day of Spring, March 21, and define 'local' as 100 miles, a convenient radius that would include the [[Lower Mainland]], the southern half of [[Vancouver Island]], and [[Whatcom County]] and [[Skagit County]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]]. Their exceptions to this rule include meals eaten while traveling, meals prepared by friends, and business lunches. Their initial month was expensive as they scoured grocery stores for whatever they could find. In the second chapter, Smith describes her and MacKinnon as an unwed urban couple in their early thirties with no children and living in a rented apartment. They recount how eating impacted their relationship before and after the diet, the anonymity of prepackaged foods, the traceability of their diet, and the diets of the [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]].

The [[farmers' market]] opens in May and they are able to buy local honey to replace sugar. Seafood from the [[Strait of Georgia]] becomes a staple in their diet. The couple spend August at their cabin in northwestern BC where they fish the [[Skeena River]], pick wild berries, and eat whatever grows in their garden. Back in the Lower Mainland, the September harvest provides them with melons, peppers, eggplant, grapes, and tomatoes. To prepare for winter they preserved corn and tomatoes, made jam from berries, collected herbs from their community garden, and bought many potatoes.

During the fall, each write on the troubles in their relationship. [[David Beers]], the founder of the ''Tyee'', hosts a 100-mile [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Thanksgiving]] dinner for Smith while MacKinnon was away. In November, during a family emergency, MacKinnon travels to [[Kamloops]] where he suspends his 100-mile diet a few days. They finally find a source of flour when they discover a farmer on Vancouver Island who grows his own fruits, vegetables, meats, and wheat. In December, Smith travels to [[Edmonton]] where her grandmother feeds her microwaved pasta which she accepts.

In January they find a restaurant that specializes in local cuisine and, previously vegetarians, they cook and eat beef for the first time in years. Working in [[Malawi]], MacKinnon is struck by the contrast between their western diet and that of the poor country's: there is ample food supplies in Malawi but most is exported to Canada and the United States who buy the food they do not require. The couple learn about [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]] and [[Maya cuisine]] while in [[Merida, Mexico]] for a wedding. The book ends with an epilogue, written by both Smith and MacKinnon six months after their one-year diet. They make a symbolic journey to [[Bamfield]], within their 100-mile radius, to collect sea water for its salt and prove they could obtain their own salt supply.

==Style and genre==
The book uses a first person memoir style with Smith and MacKinnon taking turns writing each chapter.&lt;ref name=Coppard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkins&gt;{{cite news |first = Charles |last = Wilkins |title = Think globally, shop locally, eat really well |work = [[The Globe and Mail]] |location = Toronto |date = 21 April 2007 |page = D1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors purposely avoided writing a self-help book in favour of the memoir style, saying, "We wanted to show readers that process, and how it affected us and let them see it through our eyes."&lt;ref name=Giese/&gt; The topics sometimes go beyond the motivations and challenges of the diet into more personal relationship issues. Prior to writing the book they created a general plan on where the narrative would lead.&lt;ref name=Conner&gt;{{cite news |first = Shawn |last = Conner|title = Year of eating locally |work = [[Vancouver Courier]] |date = 13 April 2007 |page = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; They took turns writing so they could monitor each other's progress. As the two alternate there are shifts in perspectives, though the overall theme of "traceability" persisted.&lt;ref name=Simonds/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkins/&gt; The general tone has been described as charming, innocent, and sometimes funny.&lt;ref name=Simonds/&gt; Smith's chapters have been said to demonstrate more honesty and vulnerability, while MacKinnon's were more "show pieces, little tours de force".&lt;ref name=Wilkins/&gt; The final chapter was authored together by Smith and MacKinnon writing as a disembodied third-person narrator to summarize and conclude the book.&lt;ref name=Wilkins/&gt;

==Reaction to the diet==
While the concept of only eating locally grown food is not new, the book coincided with the emerging popularity of the [[Local food|locavore]] movement and farmer's markets.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Carolyn |last=Cooper |date= April 2007 |title=100 miles and counting |magazine = [[Food in Canada]] |page=7 |volume=67 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roosevelt&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Margot |last=Roosevelt |date= 12 June 2006 |title=The Lure of the 100-Mile Diet |magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |page=78 |volume = 167 |issue=24 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1200783,00.html |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media outlets in North America examined the feasibility of only eating food produced locally, local food-themed events, and locavore groups.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite news |first =Jacquie |last =Moore |title = Living La Feeda Local: Can Calgarians eat a 100-mile diet? |work = [[Calgary Herald]] |date = 27 July 2007 |page = SW24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Irving&gt;{{cite news |first =Pamela |last =Irving |title = Local couple takes the 100-mile challenge; Discover buying, preparing only locally produced food results in healthier eating |work = [[Edmonton Journal]] |date = 10 October 2007 |page = E10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cosier&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Susan |last=Cosier |date= September–October 2007 |title=The 100-Mile Diet: The Struggles and Successes of Eating Local Foods |magazine = [[E - The Environmental Magazine]] |volume=18 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World Food Day]] in 2006, playing off the popularity of Smith and MacKinnon's articles in ''The Tyee'', the [[Vancouver City Hall]] held a 100-mile themed breakfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title = Councillors will breakfast close to home in celebration of World Food Day |work = [[The Vancouver Sun]] |date = 13 October 2005 |page = B2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locavore groups have held local-only dinner parties and week-long challenges.&lt;ref name=Burros&gt;{{cite news |first =Martin |last =Burros |title = Preserving Fossil Fuels and Nearby Farmland by Eating Locally |work = The New York Times |date = 25 April 2007 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/25/dining/25loca.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dumke&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Jennifer |last=Dumke |date= May–June 2007 |title=Eating In the Neighborhood: My 100 Mile Diet |magazine=South Dakota Magazine |pages=26–30 |volume =24 |issue=1 |issn=0886-2680}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some restaurants and caterers offered 100-mile menus, one being The Herbfarm Restaurant in Woodinville, Washington. Some farmers, gardeners, or regional food producers began offering subscription services to deliver produce or urban farming or gardening services. The 100-mile diet spawned many variations to allow for various circumstances and motivations. Examples include the allowance of a few non-local items, like Barbara Kingsolver chose to include spices into her local diet,&lt;ref name=Burros/&gt; or expanding the geographic area to more convenient boundaries, like the economic region, or the entire state or province.&lt;ref name=Roosevelt/&gt; A 'made-in-Manitoba' diet challenge led to a government Manitoba Food Charter recognizing and encouraging local food markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first =Laura |last =Rance |title = The 100-mile diet could be worth every step |work = [[Winnipeg Free Press]] |date = 15 September 2007 |page = B9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the American writer [[Vicki Robin]] published ''Blessing the Hands That Feed Us'' which described her experiment to eat food sourced within a ten-mile radius of her home in Washington State.

'''Tomlinson D. Todd''' was a [[Civil and political rights|civil rights activist]] located in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C]]. He was the acting director for the Institute on Race in 1941–1951 and the creator/host of the radio program "American All", which focused on education reform and implementing strategies for political empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sova.si.edu/record/ACMA.M06-077/|title=Institute on Race Relations Records |publisher=Sova.si.edu|accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Tomlinson was born in Reading, PA but was raised in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1987/04/04/obituaries/50a81840-5c51-42f8-94c6-1ef79be9a53c/|title=OBITUARIES|date=4 April 1987|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Tomlinson was credited for bringing many issues to light, and worked to bring an end to segregation and the Jim Crow laws through non-violent demonstrations. His work as president-elect of the Institute on Race lead him to discover laws from 1872 (entitled "Lost Laws") where it was legal for restaurants and other public spaces to discriminate against African Americans after the Civil War. Once discovered, these issues were able to be addressed and segregation soon ended for restaurants in the 1950s.

==Later life==
In his later life he ended up serving the Washington, D.C. community as a drivers education teacher, before passing away at the age of 76.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;
