'''Adélaïde-Emilie''' (sometimes '''Émilie-Adélaïde''') '''Filleul, Marquise de Souza-Botelho''' (14 May 1761{{snd}}19 April 1836) was a French writer.

==Biography==
She was born in [[Paris]].

Her mother, Marie Irène Cathérine de Buisson, daughter of the Seigneur de Longpré, near [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]], married a [[bourgeois]] of that town named Filleul. It was reported, though no proof is forthcoming, that [[Madame|Mme.]] Filleul had been the mistress of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and most royal genealogists give hers as his daughters, although never recognized. Her husband became one of the king's secretaries, and Mme. Filleul made many friends, among them [[Jean-François Marmontel]]. Their eldest daughter, Marie Françoise Julie Filleul (Château de Longpré, 1751{{snd}}Paris, 1822) married at the Château de Menars in 1767 [[Abel François Poisson]], marquis de Vandières et de Marigny (1727–1781), the brother of [[Madame de Pompadour]]; Adélaïde-Émilie married on 30 January 1779 Alexandre Sébastien de Flahaut de La Billarderie, comte de Flahaut de La Billarderie, a soldier of some reputation, who was many years her senior.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Souza-Botelho, Adélaide Filleul, Marquise de|volume=25|page=519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris she soon gathered round her a salon, in which the principal figure was [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand]]. There are many allusions to their liaison in the diary of [[Gouverneur Morris]], who was another of her lovers. In 1785 was born her son [[Charles Joseph, comte de Flahaut]], who was generally known to be Talleyrand's son. Mme de Flahaut fled from Paris in 1792 and joined the society of ''émigré''s at [[Mickleham, Surrey]], described in [[Fanny Burney|Mme. d'Arblay]]'s ''Memoirs''. Her husband remained at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], where he was arrested on 29 January 1793 and [[guillotine]]d. Mme. de Flahaut now supported herself by writing novels, of which the first, ''Adèle de Sénanges'' (London, 1794), which is partly autobiographical, was the most famous.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

She presently left London for [[Switzerland]], where she met [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe, duke of Orleans]]. She travelled in his company to [[Hamburg]], where she lived for two years, earning her living as a [[Hatmaking|milliner]]. She returned to Paris in 1798, and on 17 October 1802 she married [[Don (honorific)|Dom]] José Maria de Sousa Botelho Mourão e Vasconcelos ([[Porto]], 9 March 1758{{snd}}[[Paris]], 1 June 1825), [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[minister plenipotentiary]] in Paris, 2nd [[Lord]] of the [[Majorat]] of [[Vila Real Municipality|Mateus]], who was previously married in [[Lisbon]] on 23 November 1783 to Dona Maria Teresa de Noronha, of the Lords of the Majorat of os Apréstimos, by whom he had an only son, future 1st [[Count]] of [[Vila Real Municipality|Vila Real]]. Her husband was recalled in 1804, and was offered the [[Saint Petersburg]] embassy; but in the next year he resigned, to settle permanently in Paris, where he had many friends, among them the historian [[Jean Charles Leonard de Sismondi]]. He spent his time chiefly in the preparation of a beautiful edition of the ''[[Os Lusíadas|Lusiads]]'' of [[Luís de Camões]], which he completed in 1817.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Mme. de Souza lost her social power after the fall of the [[First French Empire|First Empire]], and was deserted even by Talleyrand, although he continued his patronage of Charles de Flahaut. Her husband died in 1825, and after the accession of Louis Philippe she lived in comparative retirement till her death. She brought up her grandson, [[Charles Auguste Louis Joseph, duc de Morny|Charles, duc de Morny]], her son's natural son by [[Hortense de Beauharnais|Queen Hortense]]. Among her later novels were ''La Comtesse de Fargy'' (1822) and ''La Duchesse de Guise'' (1831). Her complete works were published between 1811 and 1822.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Andrés José Garchitorena Yllana Jr.''', better known as '''Anjo Yllana''' (born April 24, 1968), is an actor-comedian, television host and politician.

==Early life==
He was born Andrés José Garchitorena Yllana, Jr. on April 24, 1968 in Quezon City (which was then geographically part of Rizal province) to Andrés Yllana and Vicky Garchitorena as the eldest of four brothers. His younger brothers are [[Jomari Yllana]], [[Ryan Yllana]] and Paulie Yllana.

==Personal life==
He was married to actress Jacqui Manzano (born March 31, 1981) with four children: Mikaela, Andee, Jaime and Nathan.

He is a member of Scouts Royale Brotherhood (SRB) International Service Fraternity and Sorority under the banner of the Alpha Delta Chapter.

==Show business life==
He started in show business in 1984 with talent manager the late [[Douglas Quijano]]. He then auditioned for the teen TV variety show ''[[That's Entertainment (TV series)|That's Entertainment]]'' after attempting a career as a professional basketball player.  He started with support roles in both comedy and drama.  He was nominated by different award-giving bodies as Best Supporting Actor in the movie ''Itanong Mo sa Buwan'', starring opposite [[Jaclyn Jose]] and directed by [[Chito S. Roño|Chito Rono]].

His turning point in show business came in 1991, when he was given the role of Dino Tengco, the mentally disabled son of the crazy politician couple Barbara and Anding Tengco in the ABS-CBN satirical sitcom ''[[Abangan Ang Susunod Na Kabanata]]''.  He was awarded Best Comedy Actor by Star Awards in 1992 for his efforts.  He was subsequently launched as a solo comedian and had several successful comedy films to his name, among them ''Dino, Abangan ang Susunod Na...'' (his launching movie), ''Pempe ni Sara at Pen'' (with [[Kris Aquino]] and [[Vandolph Quizon|Vandolph]]) and ''Milyonaryong Mini'' (with [[John Estrada]] and [[Sheryl Cruz]]).  He also became part of the sitcoms ''[[Ober da Bakod]]'' (GMA Network) and ''[[Palibhasa Lalake]]'' (ABS-CBN).  His stint in the latter sitcom cost him his role in ''Ober da Bakod'' after he decided to become an exclusive ABS-CBN talent.

After ''Abangan Ang Susunod Na Kabanata'' ended its run, Anjo turned to TV directing via the GMA Network sitcom ''M.U.?'' which starred his brother [[Jomari Yllana]] as well as [[Gelli de Belen]].  Soon after, in 1999, he moved to GMA Network after ending his contract with ABS-CBN and started hosting the long-running noontime show ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]''  His former comic tandem with [[Janno Gibbs]] in ''Ober da Bakod'' was revived via ''[[Beh Bote Nga]]'' (1999-2003) and ''Nuts Entertainment'' (2003-2007).  They also appeared together in ''Eat Bulaga!'' until Janno resigned from the show to start acting in GMA soap operas.  His last solo TV show was ''Cool Center'' where he formed a hilarious tandem with [[Eugene Domingo]] from 2008-2009.

He was known by the ''[[Kunya (Arabic)|kunyas]]'' '''Abu Aqeel'''{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and '''Abu Yazid'''.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Saad. ''Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir''.

==Early life==

He was born c.581, the second son of [[Abu Talib ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib|Abu Talib]] and [[Fatimah bint Asad]]; hence he was a brother of [[Ali]]. He was said to be an expert in genealogy.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Saad/Haq p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Fatima bint Al-Walid from the Abdshams clan of the [[Quraysh]].&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Umar al-Waqidi. ''Kitab al-Maghazi''. Translated by Faizer, R. (2011). ''The Life of Muhammad'', p. 450. London &amp; New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; He had seven sons: Muhammad, [[Muslim ibn Aqeel|Muslim]], Ja'far, Musa, Abdul Rahman, Abdullah and Abu Saeed; and a daughter, Ramla.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==At Badr==

After Muhammad [[Hijra (Islam)|departed]] from [[Mecca]], Aqeel sold the houses of his Muslim relatives among the inhabitants of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Waqidi/Faizer p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

He fought on the side of the polytheists at the [[Battle of Badr]], where he was taken prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Ishaq. ''Sirat Rasul Allah''. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). ''The Life of Muhammad'', p. 338. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad is reported to have told his companions on the Day of Badr: "Indeed I am aware that men from [[Banu Hashim]], and others also, have been brought out under compulsion with no wish to fight us. If any of you encounters one from [[Banu Hashim]] then do not kill him" &lt;ref&gt;ibn Hisham, "Sirat ibn Hisham", vol.2, p. 271. Beirut: Dar al-Kitab al-Arabi (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Umar]] said that he should be handed over to Ali to have his head cut off; but Muhammad approved of [[Abu Bakr]]'s opinion that he should be released on ransom.&lt;ref&gt;Muslim 19:4360.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Aqeel had no money, he had to be redeemed by his uncle [[Al-‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib|Abbas]] for 500 ''dinars'' or 40 ounces of gold.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume pp. 312-313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. ''Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk''. Translated by Landau-Tasseron, E. (1998). ''Volume 39: Biographies of the Prophet's Companions and Their Successors'', p. 60. Albany: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; When Muhammad told him that [[Amr ibn Hishām|Abu Jahl]] had been killed, Aqeel conceded that nobody would now challenge Muhammad's authority: "Either people will be affected by your words, or you will dominate them by force."&lt;ref&gt;Tabari/Landau-Tasseron p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to Islam==

Aqeel emigrated to [[Medina]] in mid-629, a year after [[Battle of Khaybar|Khaybar]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Tabari/Landau Tasseron p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Muhammad granted him a pension of 140 ''wasqs'' from Khaybar.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 522.&lt;/ref&gt; Aqeel and his children, due to their close relationship with Muhammad, were forbidden to receive anything from the [[zakat|alms tax]].&lt;ref&gt;Muslim 31:5920.&lt;/ref&gt;

He fought in the [[Battle of Mu'tah]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; It is said that soon after this, he fell ill and "was not mentioned at" the [[Occupation of Mecca|conquest of Mecca]], the ambush at [[Battle of Hunayn|Hunayn]] or the siege of [[siege of Ta'if|Ta'if]].&lt;ref&gt;Tabari/Landau Tasseron pp. 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; However, an alternative tradition indicates that he did in fact fight at Hunayn. When his wife asked him what plunder he had brought back from this battle, he replied: "This needle. You can sew your garments with it," and he gave her his bloodstained sword. Later Muhammad ordered anyone who had taken anything from the plunder to return it. Aqeel told Fatima, "By Allah, I think your needle is gone!" and threw his sword into the plunder.&lt;ref&gt;Waqidi/Faizer p. 450.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Muhammad==

Later Aqeel married a woman from the [[Banu Jusham|Jusham]] clan. When he was wished the traditional Arab wedding congratulation, "May you live in harmony and have many sons," he responded, "Say rather what Allah's Messenger said: 'May Allah bless you and bestow blessings upon you.'"&lt;ref&gt;Nasa'i 4:26:3373.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Maja 3:9:1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aqeel donated a carpet to the mosque in Medina. On Fridays it was spread out up the west wall. When the shadow of the wall covered the whole carpet, Umar knew it was time to come out for the [[Jumu'ah|midday prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;Malik ibn Anas. ''Al-Muwatta'' 1:13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aqeel was the fourth husband of Fatima, a sister of [[Hind bint Utbah]]. She was a wealthy woman who paid Aqeel to manage her property. She was said to be "recalcitrant" towards him; she often asked him about her father and uncle,&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Saad. ''Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir'' vol. 8. Translated by Bewley, A. (1995). ''The Women of Madina'', p. 168. London: Ta-Ha Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; who had been killed by the Muslim army.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; Aqeel once told her that they were in Hell, and their quarrel was so severe that [[Uthman]] assigned [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]] and [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas]] to mediate between them.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Saad/Bewley p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aqeel was the man who found [[Umm ul-Banin]] to marry Ali.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In old age he became blind. He died in the caliphate of Muawiyah I,&lt;ref&gt;Tabari/Landau Tasseron p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 96.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Legacy==

Descendants of Aqeel are numerous and spread out across [[Yemen]], parts of [[Oman]] and [[Somalia]].

The '''Ariel Castro kidnappings''' took place between 2002 and 2004 when three young women — Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry, and Georgina "Gina" DeJesus — were kidnapped by Ariel Castro and held captive in his home in the [[Tremont, Cleveland|Tremont]] neighborhood of [[Cleveland]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]].

DeJesus and her friend, Castro's daughter Arlene, had called Figueroa for permission to have a sleepover at DeJesus's house, but Figueroa replied they could not and the two girls parted ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/05/suspects_daughter_said_in_2004.html |title=Suspect's daughter said in 2004 she was the last to see Gina DeJesus |last1=Dissell |first1=Rachel |date=May 7, 2013 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=May 13, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Gk6Vrz5i?url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/05/suspects_daughter_said_in_2004.html |archivedate=May 19, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arlene was the last person to see DeJesus before her disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cleveland-kidnapping-latest-police-twice-visited-house-in-ohio--but-missed-three-women-held-captive-for-a-decade-8605381.html |title=Cleveland kidnapping: Son reveals his father padlocked doors to basement because 'we weren't allowed to go there' |last1=Kumar |first1=Nikhil |last2=Usborne |first2=David |date=May 8, 2013 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=May 13, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508011422/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cleveland-kidnapping-latest-police-twice-visited-house-in-ohio--but-missed-three-women-held-captive-for-a-decade-8605381.html |archivedate=May 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeJesus was taken under the impression that she was being dropped off, and trusted Castro because she was friends with his teenage daughter. Because no one witnessed DeJesus's abduction, an [[AMBER Alert]] was not issued, which angered DeJesus's father. He said in 2006, "The Amber Alert should work for any missing child … Whether it's an abduction or a runaway, a child needs to be found. We need to change this law".&lt;ref name="3 missing women found"/&gt;

A year after DeJesus' disappearance, the FBI released a [[composite sketch]] and description of a male suspect, described as "Latino, 25 to 35 years of age, {{convert|5|ft|10|in}}, {{convert|165|to|185|lb}}, with green eyes, a [[goatee]] and possibly a pencil-thin beard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Swaine |first=Jon |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10045464/Ohio-abductions-FBI-photofit-with-likeness-to-suspect-Ariel-Castro-held-for-seven-years-as-police-say-he-acted-alone.html |title=Ohio abductions: FBI photofit with likeness to suspect Ariel Castro held for seven years as police say he acted alone |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=May 9, 2013 |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608063305/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10045464/Ohio-abductions-FBI-photofit-with-likeness-to-suspect-Ariel-Castro-held-for-seven-years-as-police-say-he-acted-alone.html |archivedate=June 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to court records, Castro was {{convert|5|ft|7|in}}, {{convert|179|lb}}; he had brown eyes and a goatee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wkyc.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=33093 |title=Printout: FBI releases sketch of Gina DeJesus' alleged kidnapper |date=April 15, 2005 |publisher=WKYC |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10882714 |title=FBI had sketch of suspect but missed the connection |date=May 10, 2013 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Captivity==
After Knight's kidnapping, Castro took her upstairs, tied her hands and feet together, and pulled her up using her hands, feet, and neck. He left her there for three days without food. Prosecutors at Castro's sentencing wrote that diaries kept by the women "speak of forced sexual conduct, of being locked in a dark room, of anticipating the next session of abuse, of the dreams of someday escaping and being reunited with family, of being chained to a wall, of being held like a [[prisoner of war]], of missing the lives they once enjoyed, of [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]], of his threats to kill, of being treated like an animal, of continuous abuse, and of desiring freedom".

A [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] [[grand jury]] returned a [[Indictment|true bill]] of indictment against Castro on June 7. It contained 329 counts, including two counts of aggravated murder (under different sections of the Ohio criminal code) for his alleged role in the termination of one of the women's pregnancies. The indictments covered only the period from August 2002 to February 2007. The county prosecutor, Timothy J. McGinty, stated that the investigation was ongoing, and that any further findings would be presented to the grand jury. McGinty said that pursuing a [[death penalty]] specification would be considered following completion of indictment proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/06/ariel_castro_indicted_on_charg.html |title=Ariel Castro indicted on aggravated murder, rape, kidnapping charges |last=McCarty |first=James F. |date=June 7, 2013 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907111035/http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/06/ariel_castro_indicted_on_charg.html |archivedate=September 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ohio grand jury indicts man accused of kidnapping Cleveland women |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/08/us-usa-missing-ohio-idUSBRE95619F20130608?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews&amp;dlvrit=992637 |last1=Palmer |first=Kim |date=June 8, 2013 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=June 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608025533/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/08/us-usa-missing-ohio-idUSBRE95619F20130608?feedType=RSS |archivedate=June 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After entering a not guilty plea for Castro on June 12, one of his attorneys, Craig Weintraub, said that although some of the charges against Castro were indisputable, "it is our hope that we can continue to work toward a resolution to avoid having an unnecessary trial about aggravated murder and the death penalty". He noted, "We are very sensitive to the emotional strain and impact that a trial would have on the women, their families and this community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ariel-castro-plea-20130612,0,6763994.story |title=Ariel Castro's lawyer: Some kidnap charges 'cannot be disputed' |last=Pearce |first=Matt |date=June 12, 2013 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=June 19, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615022557/http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ariel-castro-plea-20130612,0,6763994.story |archivedate=June 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro was found competent to stand trial on July 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Accused Cleveland kidnapper ruled capable of standing trial |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/03/justice/ohio-castro-hearing/index.html |date=July 3, 2013 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907063712/http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/03/justice/ohio-castro-hearing/index.html |archivedate=September 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, a Cuyahoga County grand jury returned a true bill of indictment for the remainder of the period after February 2007.

Castro pleaded guilty on July 26 to 937 of the 977 charges against him, including charges of kidnapping, rape, and aggravated murder, as part of a [[plea bargain]] which called for consecutive sentences of [[life imprisonment|life in prison]] plus 1,000 years, all without [[parole]].&lt;ref name=usat072613/&gt; Under the plea deal, Castro forfeited his right to [[appeal]], and could not profit in any way due to his crimes.

At the sentencing hearing on August 1, Castro was sentenced to consecutive life terms in prison, plus 1,000 years, all without any possibility of parole. He was also fined $100,000. The court forfeited all of his property and assets to the Cuyahoga County government.&lt;ref name=pd130801&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/08/judge_sends_ariel_castro_to_pr.html |title=Judge sends Ariel Castro to prison for abduction, rape of Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight (slideshow) |date=August 1, 2013 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804045059/http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/08/judge_sends_ariel_castro_to_pr.html |archivedate=August 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his sentencing, Castro addressed the court for twenty minutes, in which he said he was "a good person" and "not a monster", but that he was addicted to sex and pornography, and had "practiced the art of [[masturbation]]" from a young age. He claimed that he had never beaten or tortured the women, and insisted that "most" of the sex he had with them "was consensual". He shifted between an apologetic tone and blaming the FBI for failing to catch him, as well as his victims themselves, insisting to the court that when he had sex with them he discovered they were not virgins. He would alternatively shift back into apologetic comments, saying: "I hope they can find in their hearts to forgive me because we had a lot of harmony going on in that home".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/308810/45/STATEMENT--Read-Ariel-Castros-final-remarks-in-court |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130806234708/http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/308810/45/STATEMENT--Read-Ariel-Castros-final-remarks-in-court |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 6, 2013 |title=Ariel Castro spoke for 20 minutes in court, read what he said here |date=August 1, 2013 |publisher=WKYC |accessdate=August 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentencing judge also heard from Knight and family members of Berry and DeJesus. Knight told Castro: "You took eleven years of my life away. I spent eleven years in hell, now your hell is just beginning. I will overcome all that has happened, but you will face hell for eternity. I will live on, you will die a little every day as you think of the eleven years of atrocities that you inflicted on us... I can forgive you, but I will never forget."&lt;ref name=pd130801/&gt;

On the evening of September 3, 2013, one month into his life sentence, Castro was found hanging with a bed sheet in his detention cell at the [[Correctional Reception Center]] in [[Orient, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="AP suicide"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ohio-man-who-held-3-women-captive-found-dead |title=Cleveland man's suicide brings little sympathy |last1=Sheeran |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Welsh-Huggins |first2=Andrew |date=September 4, 2013 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20131004072333/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ohio-man-who-held-3-women-captive-found-dead |archivedate=October 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prison staff performed [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] on Castro before he was taken to the [[Wexner Medical Center at Ohio State University|Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], where he was pronounced dead shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="AP suicide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Woods|first=Jim|title=Ariel Castro dies in apparent suicide|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/public/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-commits-suicide-in-prison.html|newspaper=The Columbus Dispatch|date=September 4, 2013|accessdate=September 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906090516/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/public/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-commits-suicide-in-prison.html|archivedate=September 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/justice/ariel-castro-cleveland-kidnapper-death/?hpt=hp_t1 |last1=Mungin |first1=Lateef |last2=Alsup |first2=Dave |publisher=CNN |date=September 4, 2013 |title=Ariel Castro, Cleveland kidnapper, found hanged in prison cell |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JNhFIjnY?url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/justice/ariel-castro-cleveland-kidnapper-death/?hpt=hp_t1 |archivedate=September 4, 2013 |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]] [[coroner]] Dr. Jan Gorniak announced that a preliminary [[autopsy]] had found the cause of Castro's death to be suicide by hanging.&lt;ref name="usatoday-Eversley"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eversley|first=Melanie|title=The Ohio kidnapper was not on suicide watch, but was checked on every 30 minutes by guards.|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-hung-prison/2761177/|accessdate=September 4, 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=September 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904195004/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-hung-prison/2761177/|archivedate=September 4, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, 2013, the [[Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction]] released a report that suggested Castro may have died accidentally from auto-[[erotic asphyxiation]] rather than suicide. Gorniak rejected the possibility, standing by her ruling of suicide. The report also said two prison guards had falsified logs documenting their observation of Castro hours before he was found dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Castro suicide report: Officers falsified reports|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/10/10/Ariel-Castro-suicide-report.html|publisher=The Columbus Dispatch|accessdate=October 10, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010150554/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/10/10/Ariel-Castro-suicide-report.html|archivedate=October 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro was not on [[suicide watch]] at the time of his death, but had been subject to routine checks every thirty minutes due to his notoriety.&lt;ref name="AP suicide"/&gt;

A consultant's report was released on December 3, and officially concluded that "all available evidence pointed to suicide, including a shrine-like arrangement of family pictures and a Bible in Castro's cell, an increasing tone of frustration in his prison journal and the reality of spending the rest of his life in prison while subject to constant harassment." The [[Ohio State Highway Patrol]] also reviewed the case and reached the same conclusion.&lt;ref name="suiciderpt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/03/consultants-ariel-castro-death-suicide/3850515/ |title=Consultants: Kidnapper Ariel Castro's death a suicide |last=Welsh-Huggins |first1=Andrew |date=December 3, 2013 |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=USA Today |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206061146/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/03/consultants-ariel-castro-death-suicide/3850515/ |archivedate=December 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taykinposter.JPG|right|thumb|Poster for ''The Great Tay-Kin'' by Law and [[George Grossmith|Grossmith]]]]
'''William Arthur Law''' (22 March 1844 – 2 April 1913), better known as '''Arthur Law''', was an [[English people|English]] playwright, actor and scenic designer.

==Life and career==
Law was born in [[Northrepps]], [[Norfolk]], England,&lt;ref name=VoE&gt;{{cite book | title = Visitation of England and Wales | volume =  7 |editor-last=Howard |editor-first=Joseph Jackson |editor-first2=Frederick Arthur |editor-last2=Crisp | year = 1899 | page = 64 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=btYKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA64 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to Rev. Patrick Comerford Law and his wife, Frances ''nee'' Arbuthnot.  He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.  From 1864 to 1872, he served in the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]].&lt;ref name=MaW&gt;{{cite book | title = Men and women of the time: a dictionary of contemporaries | last = Plarr | first = Victor | edition = 15th | publisher = G. Routledge | year = 1899 | page = 625 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CPcMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA625 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Law began to act, making his professional stage debut in 1872 at the Theatre Royal, [[Edinburgh]].  He then toured the British provinces and played at London's [[Surrey Theatre]] for two years, after which joined the [[German Reed Entertainments]] in London in 1874.&lt;ref name=MaW/&gt;  While performing with the [[Thomas German Reed|German Reeds]], he wrote nineteen short comic theatre works performed by the company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1026 Law, Arthur William], ''Who's Who'', 1907, vol. 59, p. 1026&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1877, Law married actress [[Fanny Holland]], with whom he appeared with the German Reeds at the [[Gallery of Illustration]] and [[St. George's Hall, London|St. George's Hall]].  The couple had a son named Hamilton Patrick John Holland Law (born 1879).&lt;ref name=VoE/&gt;

Some of Law's plays for the German Reeds include ''A Night Surprise'' in 1877 (under the pseudonym, "West Cromer"), ''A Happy Bungalow'' (1877), with music by [[Charles King Hall]]; ''Cherry Tree Farm'' (1881)&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 June 1881, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Nobody’s Fault'' (1882), both with music by [[Hamilton Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchivePressText2003/20030426.html Review of ''Nobody’s Fault''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310193857/http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchivePressText2003/20030426.html |date=10 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1881, he wrote ''[[Uncle Samuel]]'', a curtain raiser for the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] played at the [[Opera Comique]], with music by [[George Grossmith]].  It played, together with ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', in 1881, and Law appeared in the role of John Bird.  Law later appeared on stage at the [[Savoy Theatre]] as Mr. Wranglebury in the companion piece ''[[Mock Turtles (opera)|Mock Turtles]]'' in 1882, and as Major Murgatroyd in ''Patience'' in 1882, filling in for [[Frank Thornton]].&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/L/LawArthur.htm Arthur Law], Who Was Who in the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company, 27 August 2001, accessed 15 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

During a two-year period, from 1879 to 1881, Law and Holland performed on tour as "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Arthur Law's Entertainment," but the venture proved unsuccessful.  He retired from acting following a final engagement at [[Savoy Theatre]], in 1881, to turn his attention completely to writing.&lt;ref name=MaW/&gt;

===Later years===
His first "serious" drama, ''Hope'', was produced at London's Standard Theatre in 1882.  That year he also wrote a musical farce, ''Mr. Guffin's Elopement'', in collaboration with George Grossmith, for [[Toole's Theatre]], starring [[J. L. Toole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grossmith|first=George|year=1888|title=A Society Clown: Reminiscences|location=Bristol/London| publisher=Arrowsmith}} Chapter 8 [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/grossmith/gg08.html Available online here]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1885, Grossmith and Law wrote ''The Great Tay-Kin'', produced at Toole's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savoyoperas.org.uk/people/gg.html Review that mentions ''The Great Tay-Kin'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Law wrote dozens of other plays.  His best known include an adaptation of ''[[The Mystery of a Hansom Cab]]'', produced at the [[Princess's Theatre]] in 1888; ''The Judge'', produced at [[Terry's Theatre]] in 1890; ''The Magic Opal'' (an [[operetta]] with music by [[Isaac Albéniz]]) played at the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]] and the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]] in 1893; ''The New Boy'' at Terry's and the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] in 1894; ''The Sea Flower'' at the [[Comedy Theatre]] in 1898, ''A Country Mouse'' at the Prince of Wales's in 1902; ''The Bride and Bridegroom'' at the New Theatre in 1904; and ''Artful Miss Dearing'' at Terry's in 1909.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;

A few of Law’s plays were also produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], including ''The New Boy'' in 1894 at the [[Manhattan Theatre|Standard Theatre]] and ''A Country Mouse'' in 1902 at the Savoy Theatre. He also created the scenic design for ''The Bachelor'', by [[Clyde Fitch]], in 1909 at the [[Maxine Elliott Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/person.php?id=4309 "Arthur Law"], Internet Broadway Database, accessed 17 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Law died in [[Parkstone]], a suburb of [[Poole]], [[Dorset]], England at the age of 69.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;

'''Bessie Bamber''' was a British artist from [[Birkenhead]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Knowles]] on [[BBC Television]] [[Antiques Roadshow]]{{Failed verification|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was active between 1900 and 1910. It is not known if Bamber was her married name or maiden name.

Bessie Bamber worked in oils and specialised in painting cats, kittens and occasionally puppies. She usually painted on porcelain or opaline glass, and sometimes on a polished mahogany panel. She preferred to work using stuffed animals rather than live ones. There is no record of her exhibiting her paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baronfineart.com/Gallery/bessie_bamber.htm Biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703182007/http://www.baronfineart.com/Gallery/bessie_bamber.htm |date=July 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A picture of three kittens with a pile of books was sold for £2,468 by [[Bonhams]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/wspd_cgi.sh/pubweb/publicSite.r?sContinent=EUR&amp;screen=lotdetails&amp;iSaleItemNo=1481283&amp;iSaleNo=11131&amp;sServer=http://images1.bonhams.com/&amp;sPath=2004-06/30/4154098-1-1.jpg Three kittens with a pile of books]{{full citation needed|date=December 2013}}  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403011139/http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/wspd_cgi.sh/pubweb/publicSite.r?sContinent=EUR&amp;screen=lotdetails&amp;iSaleItemNo=1481283&amp;iSaleNo=11131&amp;sServer=http%3A%2F%2Fimages1.bonhams.com%2F&amp;sPath=2004-06%2F30%2F4154098-1-1.jpg |date=April 3, 2005  }} (Bonhams sale report 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ellis CeDell Davis''' (June 9, 1926 – September 27, 2017) was an American [[blues]] guitarist and singer. He was most notable for his distinctive style of guitar playing.  Davis played guitar using a butter knife in his fretting hand in a manner similar to [[slide guitar]], resulting in what ''The New York Times'' critic [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] called "a welter of metal-stress harmonic [[transient (acoustics)|transients]] and a singular tonal [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.arktimes.com/RockCandy/archives/2017/09/28/cedell-davis-remembered |title=CeDell Davis remembered |first=Stephanie |last=Smittle |newspaper=[[Arkansas Times]] |date=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Davis was born in [[Helena, Arkansas]], United States, where his family worked on a local plantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.oxfordamerican.org/magazine/item/1087-still-around-here |title=Still Around Here |date=February 2, 2017 |magazine=[[Oxford American]] |issue=95 |first=David |last=Ramsey}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed music from a young age, playing harmonica and guitar with his childhood friends.

When he was 10, he suffered from severe [[polio]] which left him little control over his left hand and restricted use of his right.&lt;ref name="amg"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=cedell-davis-mn0000740771 |tab=biography |pure_url=yes}} |title=CeDell Davis Biography |first=John |last=Bush |publisher=[[All Media Network]] |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been playing guitar prior to his polio and decided to continue despite his handicap, which led to his development of the butter knife method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/22/us/the-blues-is-dying-in-the-place-it-was-born.html |title=The Blues Is Dying in the Place It Was Born |first=Rick |last=Bragg |author-link=Rick Bragg |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 22, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once he sufficiently mastered his variation on [[slide guitar]]  playing, Davis began playing in various nightclubs across the [[Mississippi Delta]] area.  He played with [[Robert Nighthawk]] for a ten-year period from 1953 to 1963.  While playing in a club in 1957, a police raid caused the crowd to stampede over Davis. Both of his legs were broken in this incident and he was forced to use a wheelchair from that time onwards.  The hardships resulting from his physical handicaps were a major influence on his lyrics and style of blues playing.

Davis moved to [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]] in the early sixties and continued his artistic work.  In recent times, Davis' music has been released by the [[Fat Possum Records]] label to much critical acclaim.  His 1994 album, produced by [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]], ''Feel Like Doin' Something Wrong'', received a 9.0 from [[Pitchfork Media]] who called it "timeless."

''The Best Of CeDell Davis'' (1995) was also released, with help from [[Col. Bruce Hampton and The Aquarium Rescue Unit]]. ''The Horror of It All'' followed in 1998. His album  ''When Lightnin' Struck the Pine'', released in 2002, included work by musicians [[Peter Buck]],  [[Barrett Martin]], [[Scott McCaughey]], and [[Alex Veley]].&lt;ref name="amg"/&gt;

Davis died on September 27, 2017, from complications of a heart attack in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], at the age of 91.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/01/obituaries/cedell-davis-bluesman-dies.html |title=CeDell Davis, Bluesman Who Played Guitar With a Knife, Dies at 91 |first=Jon |last=Pareles |author-link=Jon Pareles |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/sep/29/cedell-davis-20170929-1/?f=news-arkansas |title=Arkansas bluesman CeDell Davis dies at 91 |first=Sean |last=Clancy |newspaper=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]] |date=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Claudius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɔː|d|i|ə|s}}; {{lang-la|Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus}};&lt;ref&gt;Classical Latin spelling and [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation]] of the name of Claudius:
#{{sqc|TIBERIVS CLAVDIVS CAESAR AVGVSTVS GERMANICVS}}&lt;br&gt;{{IPA-la|tɪ'bɛ.ri.ʊs 'klau̯.di.ʊs 'kae̯.sar au̯'gʊs.tus gɛr'maː.nɪ.kʊs|IPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claudius' regal name has an equivalent English meaning of "Tiberius Claudius Caesar, the Majestic Ruler, Conqueror of the Germans".&lt;/ref&gt; 1 August 10 BC – 13 October 54 AD) was [[Roman emperor]] from 41 to 54. A member of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], he was the son of [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] and [[Antonia Minor]]. He was born at [[Lugdunum]] in [[Gaul]], the first (and until [[Trajan]], only) Roman Emperor to be born outside [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italy]]. Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his [[Roman consul|consulship]], shared with his nephew [[Caligula]] in 37.

Claudius' infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges of [[Tiberius]]'s and Caligula's reigns; potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat. His survival led to his being declared Emperor by the [[Praetorian Guard]] after Caligula's assassination, at which point he was the last man of his family. Despite his lack of experience, Claudius proved to be an able and efficient administrator. He was also an ambitious builder, constructing many new roads, aqueducts, and canals across the Empire. During his reign the Empire began the [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest of Britain]] (if the earlier [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invasions of Britain by Caesar]] and Caligula's aborted attempts are not counted). Having a personal interest in law, he presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day. He was seen as vulnerable throughout his reign, particularly by elements of the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position; this resulted in the deaths of many [[Roman Senate|senators]]. These events damaged his reputation among the  ancient writers, though more recent historians have revised this opinion. Many authors contend that he was murdered by his own wife.  After his death in 54 AD (at the age of 63), his grand-nephew, step-son, and adopted son [[Nero]] succeeded him as Emperor. His 13-year reign (slightly longer than Nero's) would not be surpassed by any successors until that of [[Domitian]], who reigned for 15 years. 

He was a descendant of the [[Octavii Rufi]] (through [[Gaius Octavius (praetor 61 BC)|Gaius Octavius]]), [[Julii Caesares]] (through [[Julia Minor (sister of Caesar)|Julia Minor]] and [[Julia Antonia]]), and the [[Claudii Nerones]] (through [[Nero Claudius Drusus]]). He was a step-grandson (through his father Drusus) and great-nephew (through his mother [[Antonia Minor]]) of [[Augustus]]. He was a nephew of Tiberius through his father, Tiberius' brother. Through his brother [[Germanicus]], Claudius was an uncle of Caligula and a great-uncle of Nero.

==Family and early life==
{{Julio-Claudian dynasty}}
Claudius was born on 1 August 10 BC at [[Lugdunum]] (modern [[Lyon, France|Lyon]], France). He had two older siblings, [[Germanicus]] and [[Livilla]]. His mother, Antonia, may have had two other children who died young.

His maternal grandparents were [[Mark Antony]] and [[Octavia Minor]], [[Augustus]]' sister, and he was therefore the great-great grandnephew of [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]]. His paternal grandparents were [[Livia]], Augustus' third wife, and [[Tiberius Claudius Nero (praetor 42 BC)|Tiberius Claudius Nero]]. During his reign, Claudius revived the rumor that his father Drusus was actually the illegitimate son of Augustus, to give the appearance that Augustus was Claudius' paternal grandfather.

In 9 BC, his father Drusus unexpectedly died on campaign in Germania, possibly from illness. Claudius was then left to be raised by his mother, who never remarried. When Claudius' disability became evident, the relationship with his family turned sour. Antonia referred to him as a monster, and used him as a standard for stupidity. She seems to have passed her son off to his grandmother [[Livia]] for a number of years.&lt;ref&gt;Dio ''Hist.'' LX 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Livia was a little kinder, but nevertheless often sent him short, angry letters of reproof. He was put under the care of a "former mule-driver"&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 2. Suet ''Claud.'' 4 indicates the reasons for choosing this tutor, as outlined in Leon (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; to keep him disciplined, under the logic that his condition was due to laziness and a lack of will-power. However, by the time he reached his teenage years his symptoms apparently waned and his family took some notice of his scholarly interests.&lt;ref name="Suet4"&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 7 AD, [[Livy]] was hired to tutor him in history, with the assistance of Sulpicius Flavus. He spent a lot of his time with the latter and the philosopher [[Athenodoros Cananites|Athenodorus]]. Augustus, according to a letter, was surprised at the clarity of Claudius' oratory.&lt;ref name="Suet4"/&gt; Expectations about his future began to increase.

===Public life===
His work as a budding historian damaged his prospects for advancement in public life. According to Vincent Scramuzza and others, Claudius began work on a history of the [[Roman civil wars|Civil Wars]] that was either too truthful or too critical of [[Octavian]]&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940) p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt;—then reigning as [[Augustus Caesar]]. In either case, it was far too early for such an account, and may have only served to remind Augustus that Claudius was Antony's descendant. His mother and grandmother quickly put a stop to it, and this may have convinced them that Claudius was not fit for public office. He could not be trusted to toe the existing [[Party line (politics)|party line]].&lt;ref name="Stuart"&gt;Stuart (1936).&lt;/ref&gt;

When he returned to the narrative later in life, Claudius skipped over the wars of the [[Second Triumvirate|second triumvirate]] altogether. But the damage was done, and his family pushed him into the background. When the [[Triumphal arch|Arch]] of [[Pavia]] was erected to honor the Imperial clan in 8 BC, Claudius' name (now Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus after his elevation to [[paterfamilias]] of Claudii Nerones on the adoption of his brother) was inscribed on the edge—past the deceased princes, [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]] and [[Lucius Caesar|Lucius]], and Germanicus' children. There is some speculation that the inscription was added by Claudius himself decades later, and that he originally did not appear at all.&lt;ref name="Stuart"/&gt;

When Augustus died in 14 AD, Claudius—then 23—appealed to his uncle [[Tiberius]] to allow him to begin the ''[[cursus honorum]]''. Tiberius, the new Emperor, responded by granting Claudius consular ornaments. Claudius requested office once more and was snubbed. Since the new Emperor was no more generous than the old, Claudius gave up hope of public office and retired to a scholarly, private life.

Despite the disdain of the Imperial family, it seems that from very early on the general public respected Claudius. At Augustus' death, the ''[[Equestrian (Roman)|equites]]'', or knights, chose Claudius to head their delegation. When his house burned down, the Senate demanded it be rebuilt at public expense. They also requested that Claudius be allowed to debate in the Senate. Tiberius turned down both motions, but the sentiment remained.

During the period immediately after the death of Tiberius' son, [[Julius Caesar Drusus|Drusus]], Claudius was pushed by some quarters as a potential heir. This again suggests the political nature of his exclusion from public life. However, as this was also the period during which the power and terror of the commander of the [[Praetorian Guard]], [[Sejanus]], was at its peak, Claudius chose to downplay this possibility.

After the death of Tiberius, the new emperor [[Caligula]] (the son of Claudius' brother [[Germanicus]]) recognized Claudius to be of some use. He appointed Claudius his co-consul in 37 in order to emphasize the memory of Caligula's deceased father Germanicus. Despite this, Caligula relentlessly tormented his uncle: playing practical jokes, charging him enormous sums of money, humiliating him before the Senate, and the like. According to [[Cassius Dio]] Claudius became very sickly and thin by the end of Caligula's reign, most likely due to [[Psychological stress|stress]].&lt;ref&gt;Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LX 2. Suhr (1955) suggests that this must refer to before Claudius came to power.&lt;/ref&gt; A possible surviving portrait of Claudius from this period may support this.

===Assassination of Caligula (41 AD)===
[[File:Herod of Chalcis coin showing Herod of Chalcis with brother Agrippa of Judaea crowning Roman Emperor Claudius I.jpg|thumb|A coin of [[Herod of Chalcis]], showing him with his brother [[Herod Agrippa I|Agrippa of Judaea]] crowning Claudius. [[British Museum]].]]

On 24 January 41, Caligula was assassinated in a broad-based [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] involving the Praetorian commander [[Cassius Chaerea]] and several [[Roman Senate|senators]]. There is no evidence that Claudius had a direct hand in the [[assassination]], although it has been argued that he knew about the plot—particularly since he left the scene of the crime shortly before his nephew was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;Major (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the deaths of [[Milonia Caesonia|Caligula's wife]] and [[Julia Drusilla (daughter of Caligula)|daughter]], it became apparent that Cassius intended to go beyond the terms of the conspiracy and wipe out the Imperial family.&lt;ref name="Josephus"&gt;Josephus ''Antiquitates Iudiacae'' XIX.

}}
In the chaos following the murder, Claudius witnessed the [[Germania|German]] guard cut down several uninvolved noblemen, including many of his friends. He fled to the palace to hide. According to tradition, a Praetorian named [[Gratus]] found him hiding behind a curtain and suddenly declared him ''[[princeps]]''.&lt;ref name="Josephus"/&gt; A section of the guard may have planned in advance to seek out Claudius, perhaps with his approval. They reassured him that they were not one of the battalions looking for revenge. He was spirited away to the [[Castra Praetoria|Praetorian camp]] and put under their protection.

The Senate quickly met and began debating a change of government, but this eventually devolved into an argument over which of them would be the new ''princeps''. When they heard of the Praetorians' claim, they demanded that Claudius be delivered to them for approval, but he refused, sensing the danger that would come with complying. Some historians, particularly [[Josephus]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Ant. Iud.'' XIX.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that Claudius was directed in his actions by the [[Iudaea Province|Judaean]] King [[Herod Agrippa]]. However, an earlier version of events by the same ancient author downplays Agrippa's role&lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Bellum Iudiacum'' II, 204–233.&lt;/ref&gt; so it remains uncertain. Eventually the Senate was forced to give in and, in return, Claudius pardoned nearly all the assassins.

==As Emperor==

The depiction on the reverse meant to commemorate the “reception of the emperor” (''imperator receptus'') at the Praetorian Camp and the protection the [[Praetorian Guard]] afforded Claudius in the days following the assassination of [[Caligula]]. Issued over a number of years in both gold and silver, these type of coins were struck to serve as part of the annual military payments Claudius had promised the Guard in return for their role in raising him to the throne]]
[[Image:Claudiuspax.jpg|thumb|250px|Claudius issued this ''[[denarius]]'' type to emphasize his [[clemency]] after Caligula's assassination. The depiction of the goddess [[Pax-Nemesis]], representing subdued vengeance, would be used on the coins of many later emperors.]]
Claudius took several steps to legitimize his rule against potential usurpers, most of them emphasizing his place within the Julio-Claudian family. He adopted the name "Caesar" as a [[cognomen]], as the name still carried great weight with the populace. In order to do so, he dropped the cognomen "Nero" which he had adopted as ''paterfamilias'' of the Claudii Nerones when his brother Germanicus was adopted out.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} As Pharaoh of Egypt, Claudius adopted the royal titulary ''Tiberios Klaudios, Autokrator Heqaheqau Meryasetptah, Kanakht Djediakhshuemakhet'' ("Tiberius Claudius, Emperor and ruler of rulers, beloved of Isis and Ptah, the strong bull of the stable moon on the horizon").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pharaoh.se/roman-emperor/Claudius |title=Claudius |access-date=March 12, 2018 |website=The Royal Titulary of Ancient Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Claudius had never been formally adopted either by Augustus or his successors, he was nevertheless the grandson of Augustus' sister Octavia, and so he felt that he had the right of family. He also adopted the name "Augustus" as the two previous emperors had done at their accessions. He kept the honorific "Germanicus" to display the connection with his heroic brother. He deified his paternal grandmother Livia to highlight her position as wife of the divine Augustus. Claudius frequently used the term "filius Drusi" (son of Drusus) in his titles, in order to remind the people of his legendary father and lay claim to his reputation.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Since Claudius was the first Emperor proclaimed on the initiative of the Praetorian Guard instead of the Senate, his repute suffered at the hands of commentators (such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]). Moreover, he was the first Emperor who resorted to bribery as a means to secure army loyalty and rewarded the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard that had elevated him with 15,000 sesterces.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Claud.'' 10&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius and Augustus had both left gifts to the army and guard in their [[will (law)|wills]], and upon Caligula's death the same would have been expected, even if no will existed. Claudius remained grateful to the guard, however, issuing coins with tributes to the Praetorians in the early part of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coin, Museum No. R1874,0715.4|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1216117&amp;partId=1|website=British Museum Online Collection|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] noted, according to the 1938 [[Loeb Classical Library]] translation by Harris Rackham, "...&amp;nbsp;many people do not allow any gems in a signet-ring, and seal with the gold itself; this was a fashion invented when Claudius Cæsar was emperor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL394.21.xml|title=Pliny The Elder, Natural History|author=Harris Rackham|publisher=Loeb Classical Library|year=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claudius restored the status of the peaceful Imperial Roman provinces of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and [[Achaea]] as [[senatorial provinces]].&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Roman People; 1984, Fritz Heichelheim, Cedric Veo, Allen Ward, Prentice Hall Inc., Englewoods, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion of the Empire===
Under Claudius, the Empire underwent its first major expansion since the reign of Augustus. The provinces of [[Thrace]], [[Noricum]], [[Pamphylia]], [[Lycia]], and [[Judea]] were [[annexation|annexed]] (or put under direct rule) under various circumstances during his term. The annexation of [[Mauretania]], begun under Caligula, was completed after the defeat of rebel forces, and the official division of the former client kingdom into two Imperial provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny 5.1–5.2, Cassius Dio, 60.8, 60.9&lt;/ref&gt; The most far-reaching conquest was [[Roman conquest of Britain|that of Britannia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza, Chap. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman emperor head.jpg|thumb|250px|Bronze head of Claudius found in the [[River Alde]] at [[Rendham]], near [[Saxmundham]], Suffolk ([[British Museum]]). Potentially taken from the [[Temple of Claudius, Colchester|Temple of Claudius]] in [[Colonia Victricensis]] during the [[Sack of Camulodunum|Boudican revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/b/bronze_head_of_claudius.aspx|title= Head of the Emperor Claudius|publisher=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 43 AD, Claudius sent [[Aulus Plautius]] with four [[Roman legion|legions]] to Britain (''Britannia'') after an appeal from an ousted tribal ally. Britain was an attractive target for Rome because of its material wealth&amp;nbsp;– particularly mines and slaves. It was also a haven for [[Gaul|Gallic]] rebels and the like, and so could not be left alone much longer. Claudius himself traveled to the island after the completion of initial offensives, bringing with him reinforcements and elephants. The latter must have made an impression on the [[British people|Britons]] when they were displayed in the large tribal centre of [[Camulodunum]], modern day [[Colchester]]. The Roman ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' of ''Colonia Claudia Victricensis'' was established as the provincial capital of the newly established [[Roman Britain|province of Britannia]] at Camulodunum,&lt;ref name="Crummy 97"&gt;Crummy, Philip (1997) City of Victory; the story of Colchester - Britain's first Roman town. Published by Colchester Archaeological Trust ({{ISBN|1 897719 04 3}})&lt;/ref&gt; where a large [[Temple of Claudius, Colchester|Temple was dedicated in his honour]].&lt;ref name="Crummy 97"/&gt;

He left after 16 days, but remained in the provinces for some time. The Senate granted him a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] for his efforts. Only members of the Imperial family were allowed such honours, but Claudius subsequently lifted this restriction for some of his conquering generals. He was granted the honorific "Britannicus" but only accepted it on behalf of his son, never using the title himself. When the Briton general [[Caractacus]] was captured in 50 AD, Claudius granted him clemency. Caractacus lived out his days on land provided by the Roman state, an unusual end for an enemy commander.

Claudius conducted a census in 48 that found 5,984,072 Roman citizens&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza, Chap. 7, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; (adult males with [[Roman citizenship]]; women, children, slaves, and free adult males without Roman citizenship were not counted), an increase of around a million since the census conducted at Augustus' death. He had helped increase this number through the foundation of Roman colonies that were granted blanket [[Roman citizenship|citizenship]]. These colonies were often made out of existing communities, especially those with elites who could rally the populace to the Roman cause. Several colonies were placed in new provinces or on the border of the Empire to secure Roman holdings as quickly as possible.

===Judicial and legislative affairs===
Claudius personally judged many of the legal cases tried during his reign. Ancient historians have many complaints about this, stating that his judgments were variable and sometimes did not follow the law.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 15. Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LXI 33.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also easily swayed. Nevertheless, Claudius paid detailed attention to the operation of the judicial system.&lt;ref name="Scramuzza ch6"/&gt;

He extended the summer court session, as well as the winter term, by shortening the traditional breaks. Claudius also made a law requiring plaintiffs to remain in the city while their cases were pending, as defendants had previously been required to do. These measures had the effect of clearing out the docket. The minimum age for jurors was also raised to 25 in order to ensure a more experienced jury pool.&lt;ref name="Scramuzza ch6"&gt;Scramuzza (1940), Chap. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Claudius also settled disputes in the provinces. He freed the island of [[Rhodes]] from Roman rule for their good faith and exempted Ilium ([[Troy#Classical Ilium (Ilion)|Troy]]) from taxes. Early in his reign, the [[Greeks]] and [[Jews of Alexandria]] sent him two embassies at once after riots broke out between the two communities. This resulted in the famous "Letter to the Alexandrians", which reaffirmed Jewish rights in the city but also forbade them to move in more families en masse. According to [[Josephus]], he then reaffirmed the rights and freedoms of all the [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Jews in the Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Ant. Iud.'' XIX.5.3 (287).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Claudius's investigators discovered that many old Roman citizens based in the city of Tridentum (the modern [[Trento]]) were not in fact citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940), Chap. 7, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor issued a declaration, contained in the ''[[Tabula clesiana]]'', that they would be considered to hold citizenship from then on, since to strip them of their status would cause major problems. However, in individual cases, Claudius punished false assumption of citizenship harshly, making it a capital offense. Similarly, any freedmen found to be laying false claim to membership of the [[Roman equestrian order]] were sold back into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940), Chap. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous edicts were issued throughout Claudius' reign. These were on a number of topics, everything from medical advice to moral judgments. A famous medical example is one promoting [[Taxus baccata|yew]] juice as a cure for [[snakebite]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Claud.'' 16&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius wrote that he is even said to have thought of an edict allowing public flatulence for good health.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Claud.'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#32 32]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more famous edicts concerned the status of sick slaves. Masters had been abandoning ailing slaves at the [[Temple of Asclepius, Rome|temple of Aesculapius]] on [[Tiber Island]] to die instead of providing them with medical assistance and care, and then reclaiming them if they lived. Claudius ruled that slaves who were thus abandoned and recovered after such treatment would be free. Furthermore, masters who chose to kill slaves rather than take care of them were liable to be charged with murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#25 Suetonius, ''Claud.'' 51]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public works===
Claudius embarked on many public works throughout his reign, both in the capital and in the provinces. He built two [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]], the [[Aqua Claudia]], begun by [[Caligula]], and the [[Anio Novus]]. These entered the city in 52 AD and met at the [[Porta Maggiore]]. He also restored a third, the [[Aqua Virgo]].

[[File:Esquilino - Porta Maggiore - st1.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Porta Maggiore]] aqueduct in Rome]]
He paid special attention to transportation. Throughout [[Italy]] and the provinces he built roads and canals. Among these was a large canal leading from the [[Rhine]] to the sea, as well as a road from Italy to Germany&amp;nbsp;– both begun by his father, Drusus. Closer to Rome, he built a navigable canal on the [[Tiber]], leading to [[Portus]], his new port just north of [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]]. This port was constructed in a semicircle with two [[Mole (architecture)|moles]] and a lighthouse at its mouth. The construction also had the effect of reducing flooding in Rome.

The port at Ostia was part of Claudius' solution to the constant grain shortages that occurred in winter, after the Roman shipping season. The other part of his solution was to insure the ships of grain merchants who were willing to risk travelling to Egypt in the off-season. He also granted their sailors special privileges, including citizenship and exemption from the [[Lex Papia Poppaea|Lex Papia-Poppaea]], a law that regulated marriage. In addition, he repealed the taxes that [[Caligula]] had instituted on food, and further reduced taxes on communities suffering [[drought]] or [[famine]].

The last part of Claudius' plan was to increase the amount of arable land in Italy. This was to be achieved by draining the [[Fucine lake]], which would have the added benefit of making the nearby river navigable year-round.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus ''Ann.'' XII 57&lt;/ref&gt; A tunnel was dug through the lake bed, but the plan was a failure. The tunnel was crooked and not large enough to carry the water, which caused it to back up when opened. The resultant flood washed out a large gladiatorial exhibition held to commemorate the opening, causing Claudius to run for his life along with the other spectators. The draining of the lake continued to present a problem well into the Middle Ages. It was finally achieved by the Prince [[Torlonia]] in the 19th century, producing over {{convert|160000|acre|km2}} of new arable land. &lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940), Chap. 9, pp. 173–4&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded the Claudian tunnel to three times its original size.

}}Because of the circumstances of his accession, Claudius took great pains to please the Senate. During regular sessions, the Emperor sat among the Senate body, speaking in turn. When introducing a law, he sat on a bench between the consuls in his position as holder of the power of [[Tribune]] (the Emperor could not officially serve as a Tribune of the Plebes as he was a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]], but it was a power taken by previous rulers). He refused to accept all his predecessors' titles (including [[Imperator]]) at the beginning of his reign, preferring to earn them in due course. He allowed the Senate to issue its own bronze coinage for the first time since Augustus. He also put the Imperial provinces of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] back under Senate control.

Claudius set about remodeling the Senate into a more efficient, representative body. He chided the senators about their reluctance to debate bills introduced by himself, as noted in the fragments of a surviving speech:

{{quote|If you accept these proposals, Conscript Fathers, say so at once and simply, in accordance with your convictions. If you do not accept them, find alternatives, but do so here and now; or if you wish to take time for consideration, take it, provided you do not forget that you must be ready to pronounce your opinion whenever you may be summoned to meet. It ill befits the dignity of the Senate that the consul designate should repeat the phrases of the consuls word for word as his opinion, and that every one else should merely say 'I approve', and that then, after leaving, the assembly should announce 'We debated'.&lt;ref&gt;English translation of Berlin papyrus by W.D. Hogarth, in Momigliano (1934).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 47 he assumed the office of ''[[Roman censor|censor]]'' with [[Lucius Vitellius]], which had been allowed to lapse for some time. He struck the names of many senators and equites who no longer met qualifications, but showed respect by allowing them to resign in advance. At the same time, he sought to admit eligible men from the provinces. The [[Lyon Tablet]] preserves his speech on the admittance of Gallic senators, in which he addresses the Senate with reverence but also with criticism for their disdain of these men. He even jokes about how the Senate had admitted members from beyond [[Gallia Narbonensis]] ([[Lyons, France]]), i.e. himself.  He also increased the number of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patricians]] by adding new families to the dwindling number of noble lines. Here he followed the precedent of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] and [[Julius Caesar]].

Nevertheless, many in the Senate remained hostile to Claudius, and many plots were made on his life. This hostility carried over into the historical accounts. As a result, Claudius reduced the Senate's power for the sake of efficiency. The administration of Ostia was turned over to an Imperial [[Promagistrate|Procurator]] after construction of the port. Administration of many of the empire's financial concerns was turned over to Imperial appointees and freedmen. This led to further resentment and suggestions that these same freedmen were ruling the Emperor.

==== Plots and coup attempts ====
Several [[coup]] attempts were made during Claudius' reign, resulting in the deaths of many senators. [[Appius Silanus]] was executed early in Claudius' reign under questionable circumstances.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Shortly after, a large rebellion was undertaken by the Senator [[Lucius Annius Vinicianus|Vinicianus]] and [[Lucius Arruntius Camillus Scribonianus|Scribonianus]], the governor of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], and gained quite a few senatorial supporters. It ultimately failed because of the reluctance of Scribonianus' troops, which led to the [[suicide]] of the main conspirators.

Many other senators tried different conspiracies and were condemned. Claudius' son-in-law [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Claudia Antonia's first husband)|Pompeius Magnus]] was executed for his part in a conspiracy with his father Crassus Frugi. Another plot involved the consulars Lusiius Saturninus, Cornelius Lupus, and Pompeius Pedo.

In 46, [[Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus#Family|Asinius Gallus]], the grandson of [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Asinius Pollio]], and [[Titus Statilius Taurus Corvinus]] were exiled for a plot hatched with several of Claudius' own freedmen. [[Valerius Asiaticus]] was executed without public trial for unknown reasons. The ancient sources say the charge was [[adultery]], and that Claudius was tricked into issuing the punishment. However, Claudius singles out Asiaticus for special damnation in his speech on the Gauls, which dates over a year later, suggesting that the charge must have been much more serious.

Asiaticus had been a claimant to the throne in the chaos following Caligula's death and a co-consul with the Titus Statilius Taurus Corvinus mentioned above. Most of these conspiracies took place before Claudius' term as [[Roman censor|Censor]], and may have induced him to review the Senatorial rolls. The conspiracy of [[Gaius Silius]] in the year after his Censorship, 48, is detailed in the section discussing Claudius' third wife, [[Messalina]]. Suetonius states that a total of 35 senators and 300 knights were executed for offenses during Claudius' reign.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Needless to say, the responses to these conspiracies could not have helped Senate-emperor relations.

===Secretariat and centralization of powers===
Claudius was hardly the first emperor to use [[Freedman|freedmen]] to help with the day-to-day running of the Empire. He was, however, forced to increase their role as the powers of the ''princeps'' became more centralized and the burden larger. This was partly due to the ongoing hostility of the Senate, as mentioned above, but also due to his respect for the senators. Claudius did not want free-born magistrates to have to serve under him, as if they were not peers.

The secretariat was divided into bureaus, with each being placed under the leadership of one freedman. [[Tiberius Claudius Narcissus|Narcissus]] was the secretary of correspondence. [[Pallas (freedman)|Pallas]] became the secretary of the treasury. [[Gaius Julius Callistus|Callistus]] became secretary of justice. There was a fourth bureau for miscellaneous issues, which was put under [[Polybius (freedman)|Polybius]] until his execution for treason. The freedmen could also officially speak for the Emperor, as when Narcissus addressed the troops in Claudius' stead before the conquest of Britain.&lt;ref name="Tac"&gt;Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 65. Seneca ''Ad Polybium.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Since these were important positions, the senators were aghast at their being placed in the hands of former slaves. If freedmen had total control of money, letters, and law, it seemed it would not be hard for them to manipulate the Emperor. This is exactly the accusation put forth by the ancient sources. However, these same sources admit that the freedmen were loyal to Claudius.&lt;ref name="Tac"/&gt;

He was similarly appreciative of them and gave them due credit for policies where he had used their advice. However, if they showed treasonous inclinations, the Emperor did punish them with just force, as in the case of Polybius and Pallas' brother, [[Antonius Felix|Felix]]. There is no evidence that the character of Claudius' policies and edicts changed with the rise and fall of the various freedmen, suggesting that he was firmly in control throughout.

Regardless of the extent of their political power, the freedmen did manage to amass wealth through their positions. [[Pliny the Elder]] notes that several of them were richer than [[Crassus]], the richest man of the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''Natural History'' 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious reforms===
[[File:Claudius (M.A.N. Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Claudius, [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]]]]
Claudius, as the author of a treatise on Augustus' religious reforms, felt himself in a good position to institute some of his own. He had strong opinions about the proper form for state religion. He refused the request of Alexandrian Greeks to dedicate a temple to his divinity, saying that only gods may choose new gods. He restored lost days to festivals and got rid of many extraneous celebrations added by Caligula. He re-instituted old observances and archaic language.

Claudius was concerned with the spread of eastern mysteries within the city and searched for more Roman replacements. He emphasized the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] which had been practiced by so many during the Republic. He expelled foreign astrologers, and at the same time rehabilitated the old Roman soothsayers (known as [[haruspices]]) as a replacement. He was especially hard on [[Druidism]], because of its incompatibility with the Roman state religion and its [[Proselytism|proselytizing]] activities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Claudius forbade proselytizing in any religion, even in those regions where he allowed natives to worship freely.

{{main|Claudius' expulsion of Jews from Rome}}

It is also reported that at one time he expelled the Jews from Rome, probably because the Jews within the city caused continuous disturbances at the instigation of [[Chrestus]].&lt;ref&gt;There is some debate about what actually happened. It is reported by Suetonius and in Acts (18:2), Cassius Dio minimizes the event and Josephus—who was reporting on Jewish events—does not mention it at all. Some scholars hold that it didn't happen, while others have only a few missionaries expelled for the short term.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public games and entertainments===
According to Suetonius, Claudius was extraordinarily fond of games. He is said to have risen with the crowd after gladiatorial matches and given unrestrained praise to the fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. Claud. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius also presided over many new and original events. Soon after coming into power, Claudius instituted games to be held in honor of his father on the latter's birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. Claud. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Annual games were also held in honour of his accession, and took place at the Praetorian camp where Claudius had first been proclaimed Emperor.&lt;ref name="Suet"&gt;Suet. Claud. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Claudius organised a performance of the [[Secular Games]], marking the 800th anniversary of the founding of Rome. Augustus had performed the same games less than a century prior. Augustus' excuse was that the interval for the games was 110 years, not 100, but his date actually did not qualify under either reasoning.&lt;ref name="Suet"/&gt; Claudius also presented naval battles to mark the attempted draining of the [[Fucine Lake]], as well as many other public games and shows.

At Ostia, in front of a crowd of spectators, Claudius fought a [[killer whale]] which was trapped in the harbour. The event was witnessed by [[Pliny the Elder]]:

{{quote|A killer whale was actually seen in the harbour of Ostia, locked in combat with the emperor Claudius. She had come when he was completing the construction of the harbour, drawn there by the wreck of a ship bringing leather hides from Gaul, and feeding there over a number of days, had made a furrow in the shallows: the waves had raised up such a mound of sand that she couldn't turn around at all, and while she was pursuing her banquet as the waves moved it shorewards, her back stuck up out of the water like the overturned keel of a boat. The Emperor ordered that a large array of nets be stretched across the mouths of the harbour, and setting out in person with the Praetorian cohorts gave a show to the Roman people, soldiers showering lances from attacking ships, one of which I saw swamped by the beast's waterspout and sunk.—"''Historia Naturalis''" IX.14–15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ostia-antica.org/~atexts/plinsen.htm Translation of] Pliny's ''Historia Naturalis''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Claudius also restored and adorned many public venues in Rome. At the [[Circus Maximus]], the turning posts and starting stalls were replaced in marble and embellished, and an embankment was probably added to prevent flooding of the track.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, John, Roman circuses: arenas for chariot racing, University of California Press, 1986, pp. 100-101&lt;/ref&gt;  Claudius also reinforced or extended the seating rules that reserved front seating at the Circus for senators.&lt;ref name="Suet"/&gt; Claudius rebuilt [[Pompey's Theatre]] after it had been destroyed by fire, organising special fights at the re-dedication which he observed from a special platform in the orchestra box.&lt;ref name="Suet"/&gt;

==Marriages and personal life==
Suetonius and the other ancient authors accused Claudius of being dominated by women and wives, and of being a [[Womanizing|womanizer]].

Claudius married four times, after two failed betrothals. The first betrothal was to his distant cousin [[Aemilia Lepida (fiancee of Claudius)|Aemilia Lepida]], but was broken for political reasons. The second was to [[Livia Medullina]], which ended with Medullina's sudden death on their wedding day.

===Plautia Urgulanilla===
[[Plautia Urgulanilla]] was the granddaughter of Livia's confidant [[Urgulania]]. During their marriage she gave birth to a son, Claudius Drusus. Drusus died of asphyxiation in his early teens, shortly after becoming engaged to Junilla, the daughter of [[Sejanus]].

Claudius later divorced Urgulanilla for adultery and on suspicion of murdering her sister-in-law Apronia. When Urgulanilla gave birth after the divorce, Claudius [[repudiate]]d the baby girl, Claudia, as the father was allegedly one of his own freedmen. This action made him later the target of criticism by his enemies.

===Aelia Paetina===
Soon after (possibly in 28), Claudius married [[Aelia Paetina]], a relative of Sejanus, if not Sejanus's adoptive sister. During their marriage, Claudius and Paetina had a daughter, [[Claudia Antonia]]. He later divorced her after the marriage became a political liability, although Leon (1948) suggests it may have been due to emotional and mental abuse by Paetina.

===Valeria Messalina===
[[Image:Messalinaandbritannicus.jpg|thumb|250px|Messalina holding her son Britannicus, [[Louvre]]]]
Some years after divorcing Aelia Paetina, in 38 or early 39, Claudius married [[Valeria Messalina]], who was his first cousin once removed and closely allied with Caligula's circle. Shortly thereafter, she gave birth to a daughter, [[Claudia Octavia]]. A son, first named Tiberius Claudius Germanicus, and later known as [[Britannicus]], was born just after Claudius' accession.

This marriage ended in tragedy. The ancient historians allege that Messalina was a [[Hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]] who was regularly unfaithful to Claudius—[[Tacitus]] states she went so far as to compete with a [[prostitute]] to see who could have the most sexual partners in a night&lt;ref&gt;Tac. ''Ann.'' XI 10. Also Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LXI 31, and Pliny ''Nat. Hist.'' X 172.&lt;/ref&gt;—and manipulated his policies in order to amass wealth. In 48, Messalina married her lover [[Gaius Silius (consul designatus 49 AD)|Gaius Silius]] in a public ceremony while Claudius was at [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]].

Sources disagree as to whether or not she divorced the Emperor first, and whether the intention was to usurp the throne. Under Roman law, the spouse needed to be informed that he or she had been divorced before a new marriage could take place; the sources state that Claudius was in total ignorance until after the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Claudius| author=Barbara Levick| publisher=Yale University Press| year=1990| p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scramuzza, in his biography, suggests that Silius may have convinced Messalina that Claudius was doomed, and the union was her only hope of retaining rank and protecting her children.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940) p.&amp;nbsp;90. Momigliano (1934) pp.&amp;nbsp;6–7. Levick (1990) p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Tacitus]] suggests that Claudius's ongoing term as Censor may have prevented him from noticing the affair before it reached such a critical point.&lt;ref&gt;Tac. ''Ann.'' XI. 25, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the case, the result was the execution of Silius, Messalina, and most of her circle.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar, Michael (2001). ''A Treasure of Royal Scandals'', p.212. Penguin Books, New York. {{ISBN|0-7394-2025-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agrippina the Younger===
Claudius did marry once more. The ancient sources tell that his freedmen put forward three candidates, [[Caligula]]'s third wife [[Lollia Paulina]], Claudius's divorced second wife [[Aelia Paetina]] and Claudius's niece [[Agrippina the Younger]]. According to Suetonius, Agrippina won out through her feminine wiles.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 26.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nerón y Agripina.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Sculpture of Agrippina crowning her young son Nero (c. 54–59&amp;nbsp;AD)]]

The truth is probably more political. The attempted [[coup d'état]] by Silius and Messalina had probably made Claudius realize the weakness of his position as a member of the Claudian but not the Julian family. This weakness was compounded by the fact that he did not yet have an obvious adult heir, Britannicus being just a boy.&lt;ref name="Scramuzza91-92"&gt;Scramuzza (1940) pp.&amp;nbsp;91–92. See also Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 6, 7; Suet. ''Claud.'' 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agrippina was one of the few remaining descendants of Augustus, and her son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (the future Emperor [[Nero]]) was one of the last males of the Imperial family. Coup attempts could rally around the pair and Agrippina was already showing such ambition. It has been suggested that the Senate may have pushed for the marriage, to end the feud between the Julian and Claudian branches.&lt;ref name="Scramuzza91-92"/&gt; This feud dated back to Agrippina's [[Agrippina the Elder|mother's]] actions against Tiberius after the death of her husband [[Germanicus]] (Claudius's brother), actions which Tiberius had gladly punished. In any case, Claudius accepted Agrippina and later adopted the newly mature Nero as his son.

Nero was married to Claudius' daughter Octavia, made joint heir with the underage [[Britannicus]], and promoted; Augustus had similarly named his grandson [[Postumus Agrippa]] and his stepson [[Tiberius]] as joint heirs,&lt;ref&gt;Levick (1990) p.&amp;nbsp;70. See also Scramuzza (1940) p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt; and Tiberius had named [[Caligula]] joint heir with his grandson [[Tiberius Gemellus]]. Adoption of adults or near adults was an old tradition in Rome, when a suitable natural adult heir was unavailable as was the case during Britannicus' minority. Claudius may have previously looked to adopt one of his sons-in-law to protect his own reign.&lt;ref&gt;Oost (1958).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix]], who was married to Claudius's daughter [[Claudia Antonia]], was only descended from Octavia and Antony on one side&amp;nbsp;– not close enough to the Imperial family to prevent doubts (although that did not stop others from making him the object of a coup attempt against Nero a few years later). Besides which, he was the half-brother of [[Valeria Messalina]] and at this time those wounds were still fresh. [[Nero]] was more popular with the general public as the grandson of Germanicus and the direct descendant of Augustus.

==Claudius' affliction and personality==
[[File:Statue Claudius Vatikanische Museen.jpg|thumb|220px|Claudius depicted as the [[Jupiter (mythology)|Roman god Jupiter]]]]
The historian [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]] describes the physical manifestations of Claudius' affliction in relatively good detail.&lt;ref name = "boyjnt"&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 30.&lt;/ref&gt; His knees were weak and gave way under him and his head shook. He stammered and his speech was confused. He slobbered and his nose ran when he was excited. The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] states in his ''[[Apocolocyntosis]]'' that Claudius' voice belonged to no land animal, and that his hands were weak as well.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca ''Apocolo.'' 5, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he showed no physical deformity, as Suetonius notes that when calm and seated he was a tall, well-built figure of ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]''.&lt;ref name = "boyjnt"/&gt; When angered or stressed, his symptoms became worse. Historians agree that this condition improved upon his accession to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius himself claimed that he had exaggerated his ailments to save his life.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern assessments of his health have changed several times in the past century. Prior to [[World War II]], [[infantile paralysis]] (or polio) was widely accepted as the cause. This is the diagnosis used in [[Robert Graves]]' [[Claudius (novel)|Claudius novels]], first published in the 1930s. Polio does not explain many of the described symptoms, however, and a more recent theory implicates [[cerebral palsy]] as the cause, as outlined by Ernestine Leon.&lt;ref&gt;Leon (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tourette syndrome]] has also been considered a possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Burden, George. [http://www.mentalhealth.com/mag1/p5m-tor1.html The Imperial Gene] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010611131717/http://www.mentalhealth.com/mag1/p5m-tor1.html |date=11 June 2001 }}, ''The Medical Post'', 16 July 1996.

As a person, ancient historians described Claudius as generous and lowbrow, a man who sometimes lunched with the [[plebeians]].&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 5, 21, 40; Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LX 2, 5, 12, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; They also paint him as bloodthirsty and cruel, overly fond of [[gladiator]]ial combat and executions, and very quick to anger; Claudius himself acknowledged the latter trait, and apologized publicly for his temper.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 34, 38. Tacitus ''Ann.'' XII 20.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ancient historians he was also overly trusting, and easily manipulated by his wives and freedmen.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 29. Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LX 2, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; But at the same time they portray him as paranoid and apathetic, dull and easily confused.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 35, 36, 37, 39, 40. Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LX 2, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Claudius' extant works present a different view, painting a picture of an intelligent, scholarly, well-read, and conscientious administrator with an eye to detail and justice. Thus, Claudius becomes an enigma. Since the discovery of his "[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/claualex.html Letter to the Alexandrians]" in the last century, much work has been done to rehabilitate Claudius and determine where the truth lies.

==Scholarly works and their impact==
Claudius wrote copiously throughout his life. [[Arnaldo Momigliano]] states that during the reign of Tiberius&amp;nbsp;– which covers the peak of Claudius' literary career&amp;nbsp;– it became impolitic to speak of republican Rome. The trend among the young historians was to either write about the new empire or obscure antiquarian subjects. Claudius was the rare scholar who covered both.&lt;ref&gt;Momigliano (1934) pp.&amp;nbsp;4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the history of Augustus' reign that caused him so much grief, his major works included ''Tyrrhenica'', a twenty-book [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] history, and ''Carchedonica'', an eight-volume history of [[Carthage]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature'', 1937  p.107&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] dictionary. He also wrote a [[De arte aleae|book on dice-playing]].  Despite the general avoidance of the Republican era, he penned a defense of [[Cicero]] against the charges of [[Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus|Asinius Gallus]]. Modern historians have used this to determine the nature of his politics and of the aborted chapters of his civil war history.

[[File:Claudian letters.svg|thumb|The [[Claudian letters]].]]
He proposed a reform of the [[Latin alphabet]] by the addition of [[Claudian letters|three new letters]], two of which served the function of the modern letters ''W'' and ''Y''. He officially instituted the change during his censorship but they did not survive his reign. Claudius also tried to revive the old custom of putting dots between successive words (Classical Latin was written with no spacing). Finally, he wrote an eight-volume autobiography that Suetonius describes as lacking in taste.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Claudius (like most of the members of his dynasty) harshly criticized his predecessors and relatives in surviving speeches,&lt;ref&gt;See Claudius' letter to the people of Trent (linked below), in which he refers to the "obstinate retirement" of Tiberius. See also Josephus ''Ant Iud.'' XIX, where an edict of Claudius refers to Caligula's "madness and lack of understanding."&lt;/ref&gt; it is not hard to imagine the nature of Suetonius' charge.

None of the works survive but live on as sources for the surviving histories of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Suetonius quotes Claudius' autobiography once and must have used it as a source numerous times. Tacitus uses Claudius' arguments for the orthographical innovations mentioned above and may have used him for some of the more antiquarian passages in his annals. Claudius is the source for numerous passages of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Momigliano (1934) Chap.&amp;nbsp;1, note&amp;nbsp;20 (p.&amp;nbsp;83). Pliny credits him by name in Book VII 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of historical study on Claudius is obvious. In his speech on Gallic senators, he uses a version of the founding of Rome identical to that of Livy, his tutor in adolescence. The speech is meticulous in details, a common mark of all his extant works, and he goes into long digressions on related matters. This indicates a deep knowledge of a variety of historical subjects that he could not help but share. Many of the public works instituted in his reign were based on plans first suggested by [[Julius Caesar]]. Levick believes this emulation of Caesar may have spread to all aspects of his policies.&lt;ref&gt;Levick (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

His censorship seems to have been based on those of his ancestors, particularly [[Appius Claudius Caecus]], and he used the office to put into place many policies based on those of Republican times. This is when many of his religious reforms took effect, and his building efforts greatly increased during his tenure. In fact, his assumption of the office of Censor may have been motivated by a desire to see his academic labors bear fruit. For example, he believed (as most Romans did) that his ancestor [[Appius Claudius Caecus]] had used the censorship to introduce [[R|the letter "R"]]&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1993) refers to the historian [[Varro]]'s account of the introduction&lt;/ref&gt; and so used his own term to introduce his new letters.

==Death==
[[File:Togato con tesa dell'imperatore claudio, inv. 2221.JPG|thumb|upright|A statue of Claudius in the [[Vatican Museums|Vatican museum]].]]
The consensus of ancient historians was that Claudius was murdered by poison—possibly contained in mushrooms or on a feather—and died in the early hours of 13 October 54 AD.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all implicate his final wife, [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]], as the instigator. Agrippina and Claudius had become more combative in the months leading up to his death. This carried on to the point where Claudius openly lamented his bad wives, and began to comment on Britannicus' approaching manhood with an eye towards restoring his status within the imperial family.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 43&lt;/ref&gt; Agrippina had motive in ensuring the succession of Nero before Britannicus could gain power.

Some implicate either his taster [[Halotus]], his doctor [[Gaius Stertinius Xenophon|Xenophon]], or the infamous poisoner [[Locusta]] as the administrator of the fatal substance.&lt;ref&gt;Accounts of his death: Suet. ''Claud.'' 43, 44. Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 64, 66–67. Josephus ''Ant. Iud.'' XX 148, 151. Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LX 34. Pliny ''Natural History'' II xxiii 92, XI lxxiii 189, XXII xlvi 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Some say he died after prolonged suffering following a single dose at dinner, and some have him recovering only to be poisoned again.&lt;ref name=Suet44&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 44&lt;/ref&gt; Among contemporary sources, [[Seneca the Younger]] ascribed the emperor's death to natural causes, while Josephus only spoke of rumors on his poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus Antiquities of the Jews 19:67; 20:148&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, some authors have cast doubt on whether Claudius was murdered or merely succumbed to illness or old age.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940) pp. 92–93 says that tradition makes every emperor the victim of foul play, so we can't know if Claudius was truly murdered. Indeed, the Emperor appears to have been seriously ill since at least 53 AD. Levick (1990) pp.&amp;nbsp;76–77. raises the possibility that Claudius was killed by the stress of fighting with Agrippina over the succession, but concludes that the timing makes murder the most likely cause.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars claim the near universality of the accusations in ancient texts lends credence to the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Levick (1990); also as opposed to the murder of Augustus, which is only found in Tacitus and Dio where he quotes Tacitus. Suetonius, an inveterate gossip, doesn't mention it at all.&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius' ashes were interred in the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]] on 24 October 54 AD, after a funeral similar to that of his great-uncle Augustus 40 years earlier.

==After death==

===Divine honours===
Already, while alive, he received the widespread private worship of a living [[Princeps]]&lt;ref&gt;Gradel I. Emperor worship and Roman religion. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-927548-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was worshipped in [[Britannia]] in his own [[Temple of Claudius, Colchester|temple in Camulodunum]].

Claudius was deified by Nero and the Senate almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Nero'' 9&lt;/ref&gt; Those who regard this homage as cynical should note that, cynical or not, such a move would hardly have benefited those involved, had Claudius been "hated", as some commentators, both modern and historic, characterize him. Many of Claudius' less solid supporters quickly became Nero's men. Claudius' will had been changed shortly before his death to either recommend Nero and Britannicus jointly or perhaps just Britannicus, who would have been considered an adult man according to Roman law only a few months later.

===Views of the new regime===
Agrippina had sent away [[Tiberius Claudius Narcissus|Narcissus]] shortly before Claudius' death, and now murdered the freedman. The last act of this secretary of letters was to burn all of Claudius' correspondence—most likely so it could not be used against him and others in an already hostile new regime. Thus Claudius' private words about his own policies and motives were lost to history. Just as Claudius had criticized his predecessors in official edicts (see below), Nero often criticized the deceased Emperor and many of Claudius' laws and edicts were disregarded under the reasoning that he was too stupid and senile to have meant them.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Nero'' 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s [[Apocolocyntosis]] mocks the deification of Claudius and reinforces the view of Claudius as an unpleasant fool; this remained the official view for the duration of Nero's reign. Eventually Nero stopped referring to his deified adoptive father at all, and realigned with his birth family. Claudius' temple was left unfinished after only some of the foundation had been laid down. Eventually the site was overtaken by Nero's [[Domus Aurea|Golden House]].&lt;ref name = "iiovah"&gt;Levick (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flavian and later perspectives===
The [[Flavians]], who had risen to prominence under Claudius, took a different tack. They were in a position where they needed to shore up their legitimacy, but also justify the fall of the Julio-Claudians. They reached back to Claudius in contrast with Nero, to show that they were good associated with good. Commemorative coins were issued of Claudius and his son [[Britannicus]], who had been a friend of the Emperor [[Titus]] (Titus was born in 39, Britannicus was born in 41). When Nero's [[Domus Aurea|Golden House]] was burned, the [[Temple of Claudius]] was finally completed on the Caelian Hill.&lt;ref name = "iiovah"/&gt;

However, as the Flavians became established, they needed to emphasize their own credentials more, and their references to Claudius ceased. Instead, he was lumped with the other emperors of the fallen dynasty. His state cult in Rome probably continued until the abolition of all such cults of dead Emperors by [[Maximinus Thrax]] in 237–238.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel I. Emperor worship and Roman religion. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-927548-9}} p.&amp;nbsp;356–341&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Feriale Duranum]]'', probably identical to the festival calendars of every regular army unit, assigns him a sacrifice of a [[Cattle#Terminology|steer]] on his birthday, the [[Kalends]] of August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=6mce147Z_EEC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=Feriale+Duranum#v=onepage&amp;q=Feriale%20Duranum&amp;f=false | title = Rome and Its Empire, AD 193-284 | isbn = 978-0-7486-2304-4 | author1 = Hekster | first1 = Olivier | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; And such commemoration (and consequent feasting) probably continued until the Christianization and disintegration of the army in the late 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel I. Emperor worship and Roman religion. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-927548-9}} p.367&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views of ancient historians===
The main ancient historians [[Tacitus]], [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], and [[Cassius Dio]] all wrote after the last of the Flavians had gone. All three were senators or ''equites''. They took the side of the Senate in most conflicts with the Princeps, invariably viewing him as being in the wrong. This resulted in biases, both conscious and unconscious. Suetonius lost access to the official archives shortly after beginning his work. He was forced to rely on second-hand accounts when it came to Claudius (with the exception of Augustus' letters, which had been gathered earlier). Suetonius painted Claudius as a ridiculous figure, belittling many of his acts and attributing the objectively good works to his retinue.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza, p.&amp;nbsp;29&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacitus wrote a narrative for his fellow senators and fitted each of the emperors into a simple mold of his choosing.&lt;ref&gt;Vessey (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote of Claudius as a passive pawn and an idiot in affairs relating to the palace and often in public life. During his censorship of 47-8 Tacitus allows the reader a glimpse of a Claudius who is more statesmanlike (XI.23-25), but it is a mere glimpse. Tacitus is usually held to have 'hidden' his use of Claudius' writings and to have omitted Claudius' character from his works.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (1990). ''Ann.'' XI 14 is often thought to be a good example: the digression on the history of writing is actually Claudius' own argument for his new letters, and fits in with his personality and extant writings. Tacitus makes no explicit attribution - and so there exists the possibility that the digression is Tacitus' own work or derivative of another source&lt;/ref&gt; Even his version of Claudius' Lyons tablet speech is edited to be devoid of the Emperor's personality. Dio was less biased, but seems to have used Suetonius and Tacitus as sources. Thus the conception of Claudius as the weak fool, controlled by those he supposedly ruled, was preserved for the ages.

As time passed, Claudius was mostly forgotten outside of the historians' accounts. His books were lost first, as their antiquarian subjects became unfashionable. In the 2nd century, [[Pertinax]], who shared his birthday, became emperor, overshadowing commemoration of Claudius.&lt;ref&gt;Levick. ''Claudius'' p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

==In modern literature, film and radio==
*The best known fictional representation of the Emperor Claudius was contained in the books ''[[I, Claudius]]'' and ''[[Claudius the God]]'' (published in 1934 and 1935, respectively) by [[Robert Graves]], both written in the [[Grammatical person|first-person]] to give the reader the impression that they are Claudius' [[autobiography]]. Graves employed a fictive artifice to suggest that they were recently discovered, genuine translations of Claudius' writings. Claudius' extant letters, speeches, and sayings were incorporated into the text (mostly in the second book, ''Claudius the God''), to add authenticity.
**In 1937, director [[Josef von Sternberg]] attempted a film version of ''[[I, Claudius (film)|I, Claudius]]'', with [[Charles Laughton]] as Claudius. However, the lead actress, [[Merle Oberon]], suffered a near-fatal car accident and the movie was never finished. The surviving reels were featured in the BBC documentary ''The Epic That Never Was'' (1965). The motion picture rights for a new film eventually passed to producer [[Scott Rudin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie-synopsis/i-claudius.1/|title=I, Claudius (2009)&amp;nbsp;– Synopsis|accessdate=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Graves's two books were the basis for a British television adaptation ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]'', produced by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]. The series starred [[Derek Jacobi]] as Claudius and was broadcast in 1976 on [[BBC Two|BBC2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=I, Claudius|date=1977-11-06|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074006/|accessdate=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a substantial critical success, and won several [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards. The series was later broadcast in the United States on ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'' in 1977. The 1996 7-VHS release and the later DVD release of the television series, include ''The Epic That Never Was'' documentary.
**A radio adaptation of the Graves novels by [[Robin Brooks]] and directed by [[Jonquil Panting]], was broadcast in six one-hour episodes on [[BBC Radio 4]] beginning 4 December 2010. The cast featured [[Tom Goodman-Hill]] as Claudius, [[Derek Jacobi]] as Augustus, [[Harriet Walter]] as Livia, [[Tim McInnerny]] as Tiberius and [[Samuel Barnett (actor)|Samuel Barnett]] as Caligula.
**In 2011, it was announced rights for a miniseries adaptation passed to HBO and BBC2.  Anne Thomopoulos and Jane Tranter, producers of the popular HBO–BBC2 ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'' miniseries, were attached to the ''I, Claudius'' project.  However, as of 2018, it has yet to be produced, and no release date is pending.
*The 1954 film ''[[Demetrius and the Gladiators]]'' also portrayed him sympathetically, played by [[Barry Jones (actor)|Barry Jones]].
*In the 1960 film ''[[Messalina (1960 film)|Messalina]]'', Claudius is portrayed by [[Mino Doro]].
*On television, [[Freddie Jones]] portrayed Claudius in the 1968 British [[television]] series ''[[The Caesars (TV series)|The Caesars]]''.
*The 1975 TV Special ''Further Up Pompeii!'' (based on the [[Frankie Howerd]] sit-com ''[[Up Pompeii!]]'') featured [[Cyril Appleton]] as Claudius.
*In the 1979 motion picture ''[[Caligula (film)|Caligula]]'', where the role was performed by [[Giancarlo Badessi]], Claudius is depicted as an idiot, in contrast to [[Robert Graves]]' portrait of Claudius as a cunning and deeply intelligent man, who is perceived by others to be an idiot.
*The 1985 made-for-television [[miniseries]] ''A.D.'' features actor [[Richard Kiley]] as Claudius.  Kiley portrays him as thoughtful, but willing to cater to public opinion as well as being under the influence of Agrippina.
*In the 2004 TV film ''[[Nero (2004 film)|Imperium: Nero]]'', Claudius is portrayed by [[Massimo Dapporto]].
*There is also a reference to Claudius' suppression of a coup in the movie ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', though the incident is entirely fictional.

In literature, Claudius and his contemporaries appear in the historical novel ''The Roman'' by [[Mika Waltari]]. Canadian-born science fiction writer [[A. E. van Vogt]] reimagined Robert Graves' Claudius story, in his two novels, ''[[Empire of the Atom]]'' and ''[[The Wizard of Linn]]''.

'''Corbin Harney''' (March 24, 1920 – July 10, 2007) was an elder and [[Medicine man|spiritual leader]] of the Newe ([[Western Shoshone]]) people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shundahai.org/Corbin_Harney.htm Corbin Harney page at Shundahai Network website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310131526/http://www.shundahai.org/Corbin_Harney.htm |date=2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harney reportedly inspired the creation in 1994 of the [[Anti-nuclear movement in the United States#Shundahai Network|Shundahai Network]], which works for [[environmental justice]] and [[nuclear disarmament]]. The Shundahai Network plays a key role in organizing [[non-violent]] [[civil disobedience]] aimed at bringing about the closure of the [[Nevada Test Site]], which is located on Western Shoshone land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shundahai.org/Shundahai_Network_Information.htm Shundahai Network - Who We Are] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020408101529/http://www.shundahai.org/Shundahai_Network_Information.htm |date=2002-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Harney devoted his life to working to save the land on which his people have survived for thousands of years. The Newe people and [[Newe Sogobia]] have been referred to as "the most bombed people on Earth" and "the most bombed place on Earth" {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} as the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] has exploded more than 1,000 [[nuclear weapon]]s at the [[Nevada Test Site]], which is located on Western Shoshone land. The government has dumped highly [[radioactivity|radioactive]] [[nuclear waste]] there.

"The food that my people survived on is not here no more on account of this [[nuclear weapon]] that we have developed," Harney explains. "The [[pine nuts]] aren't here no more, the [[chokecherries]] aren't here, the [[antelope]] aren't here, the [[deer]] aren't here, the [[groundhog]] aren't here, the [[sagehen]] aren't here."

Sometimes called "The hardest working man in shamanism", Harney, for many years, spent most of his time travelling around the world spreading a message about the dangers of [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and the problems facing our [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]]. "The Mother Earth provides us with [[food]], provides us with [[air]], provides us with [[water]]. We, the people, are going to have to put our thoughts together, to save our planet here. We've only got one water, one air, one Mother Earth." Among other excursions, he visited mutated children in Kazakhstan hospitals who lived close to the Russian nuclear test     
site. He received the 2003 '''International Nuclear Free Future Solutions''' award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclear-free.com INFFS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Harney's formal education ended when he ran away from Indian boarding school at the age of nine because of his feelings of how his schoolmates were mistreated by their teachers. However, he was able to talk to students, government officials, and members of the public about [[toxins]] of all kinds: [[chemicals]] from [[mining]] and [[industry]], and, worst of all, [[nuclear fallout]] and [[radiation poisoning]] from [[nuclear testing]], [[nuclear waste]] storage, and nuclear waste transportation that takes place over regular [[Rail transport|railroads]] and [[highways]].

He spoke out about the [[contamination]] of our water and shared with people a vision that he experienced several years ago. "I was praying to the water and the spirit of the water told me, 'Pretty soon, I'm going to look like clean water, but no one is going to use me'. I didn't really understand what I was told until I went to [[Kazakhstan]] in Russia. Kazakhstan is where Russia tested nuclear bombs for many years. Over there I saw water that looks like clean water, but people can't drink it because it is contaminated with radiation ... [t]he [[nature]] put all the living things here for us to take care of, not to destroy them, but to work with them so that we may live with them for many more years."

Harney stated a firm belief in communication with the [[natural elements]] and all living things and numerous other people have witnessed the results of his work, including rain in [[drought]] areas, dry [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] which started flowing once more, plants flourishing where they were sparse before and the return of animals that had not been seen in their native [[habitats]] for many years {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}.

"We have to come back to the [[Indigenous peoples|Native]] way of life. The Native way is to [[Prayer|pray]] for everything. Our Mother Earth is very important. Everything survives on our Mother, the only Mother we've got. We can't just misuse her and think she's going to continue. Let's not destroy the Mother Earth. Let's take care of her and she will take care of us."

Shortly before his death, Harney completed arrangements for the publication of his second book, "The Nature Way", in which he shares the traditional knowledge that his people, the Newe, have followed since time immemorial. In 1994 he founded the [[Shundahai Network]] ("shundahai" translates to "peace and harmony with all creation") &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100420050559/http://www.shundahai.org/ Shundahai.org]&lt;/ref&gt; where he remained as board chair until his death. He was also the founder and director of '''Poo Ha Bah''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110930053214/http://poohabah.blueheronworks.com/ Poo-Ha-Bah]&lt;/ref&gt; a traditional healing center in [[Tecopa, California]].

"I have established Poo-Ha-Bah for all the people. Poo-Ha-Bah in my language is a very important word--it's talking about Doctor Water. It's really important to have healing water here, not only as a human--a lot of animal life have used healing water, a lot of different ways. My people have always traveled for many miles to get into different kinds of healing waters. This is something that we all need, and this is one reason I have looked for healing water and I finally found one in Tecopa, California. I am pretty sure that we all will enjoy the healing water if we ask the healing water to help us with our illness of all different kinds. This is something that our people have talked about for many, many years."

Harney was a proponent of universal inclusion and individual spiritual empowerment, "We need your help. Who ever you are, whatever color you are, wherever you come from on this Mother Earth of ours. We've only got this one Earth and we all have to take care of it. So I am asking all of you people throughout the world to unite yourselves together. Give us a helping hand so we can take care of all the living things."

Harney's experiences with victims of the nuclear industry throughout the world, and particularly the "[[Downwinders]]" of the Western United States, along with the powerful message he carried of peace and respect for our planet, lent unique credibility to his words. Typical of his international work was acting as keynote speaker at the Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb Conference, in 2001, in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki, Japan]], where he was able to speak with other still-recovering survivors of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}.

Trained from childhood in the traditional Newe ways of [[medicine]] and [[spirituality]] (the two are not viewed separately), Harney noted the [[extinction]] of [[medicinal plants]] due to the [[toxins]] of mining, and the disappearance of many birds and other animals that once roamed the Newe homelands. Beginning in 1957, he worked with medicine women of [[Battle Mountain, Nevada]], running the [[Sun Dance|Sundance Ceremony]] and sweat lodges as well as helping sick people. As a [[Medicine man|medicine person]], he also worked steadily to preserve and protect the sacred sites and [[burial grounds]] of his people. He was raised to view all life as [[sacred]]. "Everything is alive and has a spirit to it. The rocks, the mountains, streams, animals, plants, birds, oceans, and so forth," he says.

Harney warned of a quickly approaching time when the Earth is so contaminated by the results of human activity that all the water on the planet will be toxic to all forms of life.  His vision, however, was not fatalistic. He remained convinced that humans have the power to turn things around, saying "The water has a life, and we have to pray for it. All the water that comes from the Mother Earth, that's her blood.".

Harney affirmed that healing and well-being are everyone's business, and that no one is powerless. "Yes, you can. All of us are gifted.  We just need to open up the gifts by praying in our own way, singing our own songs and talking to everything out there with love and respect. Don't feel foolish. This is how everything has been sustained for millions of years. This will open up a totally new world for you. Amazing things will happen if you are patient.  This is how we will heal ourselves and our Mother Earth."

He died of [[cancer]] which had [[Metastasis|metastasized]] into his bones.

'''Daniel [[Cajanus (family)|Cajanus]]''' (1704 – 27 February 1749) was a [[Finnish people|Finnish]] [[gigantism|giant]]. He made his living by exhibiting himself for money; he appeared in many European countries and attracted the interest of scientists and laypeople, including royalty. After his death, portions of his skeleton found their way into museums, where some parts still remain.

==Biography==
[[File:Daniel Cajanus im Blauw Jan.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Daniel Cajanus at the Blauw Jan inn. Contemporary engraving.]]
Cajanus was born in [[Paltamo]], [[Oulu Province|Oulu]], [[Finland]], the son of a clergyman. Finland was at that time part of [[Sweden]], and Cajanus was often referred to as the "Swedish Giant". Estimates of his adult height vary and range as high as {{convert|8|ft|1.4|in|m}}. Jan Bondeson, a medical professional and author who has researched and written on Cajanus, suggests that his true height was around {{convert|7|ft|8|in|m}},&lt;ref name="bondeson" /&gt; supported by contemporaneous accounts in the ''London Annual Register''.&lt;ref name="LAR"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Account of the Irish Giant|journal=London Annual Register|date=January 1, 1760|pages=79–80|url=http://0-access.newspaperarchive.com.alec.icpl.org/uk/middlesex/london/london-annual-register/1760/01-01/page-343|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various unconfirmed versions of his early life exist, but tax records indicate he may have left the country in 1723 or soon afterward, and Finnish and Swedish tradition recounts that he joined the bodyguard of [[Frederick William I of Prussia]], which was composed of unusually tall soldiers and was nicknamed the [[Potsdam Giants]].&lt;ref name="bondeson" /&gt;

Cajanus lived for some years at the court of [[August II of Poland]], where he served as a cavalry soldier. Following the king's death in 1733 he appears to have moved on, and according to [[Theophilus Cibber]] spent time in Germany before arriving in London, where he is recorded as having appeared at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] in February 1734, playing the part of Gargantua in the [[pantomime]] ''Cupid and Psyche'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fielding|first=Henry|others=Miller, H. K., Amory, H., Goldgar, B.|title=Miscellanies|editor=Henry Knight Miller, Hugh Amory|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|year=1993|volume=2|pages=442|isbn=978-0-8195-5254-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=44Srm5z-WQsC&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=daniel%20cajanus&amp;pg=PA42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in several other productions.&lt;ref name="bondeson" /&gt; He exhibited himself for money in various places in London, billed as the "Swedish Giant". His portrait was painted twice during his stay in England by the artist [[Enoch Seeman]]; one of these portraits is now in the [[National Museum of Finland]] and depicts him in his Polish soldier's uniform, with an inscription stating his height as {{convert|7|ft|10|in|m}}. In 1735 he traveled to Paris, where he exhibited himself to paying audiences and was received privately at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] by [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], the queen and the [[Dauphin of France|dauphin]]. Later he took up residence in [[Amsterdam]], where he lived from 1735 to 1741 as the guest of the landlord of the Blauw Jan, an inn where natural curiosities could be seen and traded. After an unsuccessful spell as a [[moneylender]] Cajanus returned to exhibiting himself, visiting England again in 1741 and 1742 and appearing before a meeting of the [[Royal Society]], where his height was marked against a pillar and reported to be {{convert|7|ft|4+1/4|in|cm}} in his shoes. The society's president [[Martin Folkes]] observed that Cajanus appeared weak at this meeting, and could not stand for long.&lt;ref name="bondeson" /&gt;

The publisher [[Thomas Boreman]] met Cajanus during his visit to London in 1742 and produced a book purporting to be his biography.&lt;ref name=bondeson&gt;{{cite book|last=Bondeson|first=Jan|title=The Pig-faced Lady of Manchester Square and Other Medical Marvels|publisher=Tempus|year=2004|pages=288|isbn=0-7524-2968-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The History of Cajanus, the Swedish Giant, from his Birth to the Present Time'' was published on 23 September of that year, and advertisements for it encouraged the reader to visit the exhibition opposite the [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] where Cajanus himself could be seen.&lt;ref name="Bentley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bentley|first=R|title=Giants and Dwarfs|publisher=Harvard University|year=1868|pages=472|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3oIfAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA143&amp;vq=cajanus&amp;dq=daniel+cajanus+gargantua&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Netherlands==
[[File:Wybrand hendriks proveniershuis 1800.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Proveniershuis in Haarlem]]
Cajanus was quite popular in the Netherlands. In 1745 Cajanus settled in [[Haarlem]], Netherlands, where he bought the right to live in the [[Proveniershuis]], a [[sheltered housing]] unit that provided him with accommodation, meals and medical care. In the following years he wrote and published poetry and became a well-known figure in the town; a line marked on a pillar in the city's [[St. Bavochurch|Grote Kerk]] still records his measured height during his residence there.
[[File:daniel cajanus in Haarlem.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Pillar in the St. Bavochurch]]

&lt;ref name="allabout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.99publishers.nl/doc/All%20About%20Haarlem.pdf |title=All about Haarlem 6: City Walks |pages=7 |accessdate=2009-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724143329/http://www.99publishers.nl/doc/All%20About%20Haarlem.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This same pillar has a print now illustrating his exhibitions together with [[Simon paap|Simon Paap]], a dwarf who died in December 1828. A life-size painting of him also hung in the church for centuries, but today hangs in the Haarlem city hall.

Cajanus died on 27 February 1749, leaving a large sum in his will to pay for a lavish funeral and a burial vault inside the Grote Kerk, with the intention of safeguarding his remains from disturbance. His coffin is said to have been {{convert|9|ft|7|in|m}} long.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=C. J. S.|title=Mystery and Lore of Monsters|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=2003|pages=284|chapter=20|isbn=978-0-7661-7641-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGPEPRPPKrYC&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;ots=3ydPvFhGD5&amp;dq=daniel%20cajanus&amp;pg=PA160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his precautions, the vault was later sold, and Cajanus's bones were acquired by museums. Some are still held at the Museum of Anatomy in the [[University of Leiden]].&lt;ref name="bondeson" /&gt; Today the Dutch language still remembers him with the slang term "Cajanus voeten", for unusually large feet. In period writings, the term "Cajaan" was used to mean a giant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rUxbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA82 Finlandsche reus Cajaan] in [[Jacob Campo Weyerman]]'s "Lives of Dutch painters", 1769, on [[Google books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical==
Daniel Cajanus apparently suffered from gigantism caused by a defect of the [[pituitary]], possibly combined with [[hypogonadism]]. This is indicated by the fact that Cajanus' bodily proportions, and especially his strikingly long arms, were consistent with those of [[eunuch]]s, and by his apparently limited interest in the opposite sex.

A tendency towards gigantism was displayed more broadly in his family. His sister Agneta, who went to Haarlem after his death to deal with his estate, was depicted as an especially large woman. A distant relative, Israel Cajanus, had extremely large hands and feet and thus probably also suffered from [[acromegaly]].

The available information about Daniel Cajanus' actual size is somewhat variable, however it is clear that his height reduced somewhat over the course of his life. Investigations into his preserved bones reveal a phenomenon typical of gigantism which explains this reduction: the overproduction of growth hormone leads to a thickening of the [[cartilage]], which wears away in the course of time, leading to symptoms similar to [[osteoarthritis]]. The [[condyle (anatomy)|condyles]] of his bones show clear signs of erosion, which also explain his difficulties in walking in his later years.

== Early life ==

Ferrari was born in [[San Francisco]] on [[Christmas Day]] of 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2003-12-20/news/0312190462_1_ferrari-borderline-personality-disorder-life|title=The Laughter Turned to Tears|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|author=Villigran, Nora|date=December 20, 2003|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Cupertino High School]] at the age if sixteen and was offered a scholarship to [[Stanford University]], which he turned down to pursue a career in comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/22/news/cl-24755|title=Comedian: Take My Life, Please|publisher=Los Angeles Times|author=Glionna, John|date=September 22, 2000|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Ferrari performed his first stand-up gig at [[The Comedy Store]].&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-26/news/vl-1354_1_big-break|title=Big on Laughs|last=Locey|first=Bill|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 26, 1992|accessdate=June 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, in 1975,  he co-founded a musical comedy group called the High Wire Radio Choir. They released an album entitled ''Teenage Mutant Love'' in 1979 before disbanding in the early eighties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/High-Wire-Radio-Choir-Teenage-Mutant-Love/release/3663012|title=High Wire Radio Choir}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SF Gate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/THE-COMEBACK-COMIC-Comedian-makes-returns-to-3303328.php|title=The comeback comic|last=Fagan|first=Kevin|date=August 12, 2000|publisher=[[San Francisco Gate]]|accessdate=June 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rhéal Ernest Richard''' (May 1, 1922 &amp;ndash; September 25, 2006) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] businessman and politician in the [[New Brunswick|Province of New Brunswick]].

Known by his middle name, Ernest Richard was born and raised in [[Shippagan, New Brunswick]]. He was involved in the east-coast fishing industry for many years. He was  Director General of Shippagan Cold Storage Ltd. and after that company became a subsidiary of [[Connors Brothers Limited]] of [[Blacks Harbour, New Brunswick]], he served on the Connors [[Board of Directors]] until retiring in 1985.

From 1948 to 1957, Ernest Richard served  as a Shippagan town councillor and as Mayor from March 1957 to October 1960.  In 1948, Richard also entered provincial politics and was elected by acclamation to the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]]
as the [[New Brunswick Liberal Association|Liberal Party]] member for [[Gloucester County, New Brunswick|Gloucester County]]. He was reelected in [[New Brunswick general election, 1952|1952]], [[New Brunswick general election, 1956|1956]], [[New Brunswick general election, 1960|1960]], [[New Brunswick general election, 1963|1963]], and again in [[New Brunswick general election, 1967|1967]].

In 1960 he was made [[Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]], serving until 1963 when [[Premier of New Brunswick|Premier]] [[Louis Robichaud]] appointed him to his [[Executive Council of New Brunswick|Cabinet]] as the Province's first ever [[Department of Fisheries (New Brunswick)|Minister of Fisheries]].  Richard remained Minister of Fisheries until his retirement from politics in 1970.

Ernest Richard was involved in a number of community projects and received the Medal of Merit in 1975 for his many years of service to the [[Canadian Red Cross]]. In May 1990, the [[University of Moncton]] bestowed an honorary [[Doctorate]] in fisheries management.

[[File:Francis Burnand.png|thumb|right|250px|From ''The History of [[Punch (magazine)|"Punch"]]'']]
'''Sir Francis Cowley Burnand''' (29 November 1836 &amp;ndash; 21 April 1917), usually known as '''F. C. Burnand''', was an English comic writer and prolific playwright, best known today as the librettist of [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s opera ''[[Cox and Box]]''.

The son of a prosperous family, he was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and was expected to follow a conventional career in the law or in the church, but he concluded that his vocation was the theatre. From his schooldays he had written comic plays, and from 1860 until the end of the 19th century, he produced a series of more than 200 [[Victorian burlesque]]s, [[farces]], [[pantomime]]s and other stage works. His early successes included the burlesques ''Ixion, or the Man at the Wheel'' (1863) and ''The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up'' (1866).  Also in 1866, he adapted the popular farce ''[[Box and Cox (farce)|Box and Cox]]'' as a comic opera, ''Cox and Box'', with music by Sullivan. The piece became a popular favourite and was later frequently used by the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] as a curtain raiser; it remains regularly performed today.

By the 1870s, Burnand was generating a prodigious output of plays as well as comic pieces and illustrations for the humour magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''. Among his 55-stage works during the decade was another frequently revived hit, ''Betsy'' (1879). For ''Punch'', among other things, he wrote the popular column "Happy Thoughts", in which the narrator recorded the difficulties and distractions of everyday life. Also admired were his burlesques of other writers' works. Burnand was a contributor to ''Punch'' for 45 years and its editor from 1880 until 1906 and is credited with adding much to the popularity and prosperity of the magazine. His editorship of the original publication of ''[[The Diary of a Nobody]]'' by the brothers [[George Grossmith|George]] and [[Weedon Grossmith]] was a high point of his tenure in 1888–89. Many of his articles were collected and published in book form. His stage successes in the 1890s included his English-language versions of two [[Edmond Audran]] operettas, titled ''La Cigale'' and ''Miss Decima'' (both in 1891). His last works included collaborations on pantomimes of ''[[Cinderella]]'' (1905) and ''Aladdin'' (1909).

Known generally for his genial wit and good humor, Burnand was nevertheless intensely envious of his contemporary [[W. S. Gilbert]] but was unable to emulate his rival's success as a comic opera librettist. In other forms of theatre Burnand was outstandingly successful, with his works receiving London runs of up to 550 performances and extensive tours in the British provinces and the US.  He published several humorous books and memoirs and was knighted in 1902 for his work on ''Punch''.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Burnand was born in central London, the only child of Francis Burnand and his first wife Emma, ''née'' Cowley, who died when her son was eight days old.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Stedman, Jane W. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32183 "Burnand, Sir Francis Cowley (1836–1917)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 8 June 2014, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/32183}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnand senior, a stockbroker, was descended from an old [[Savoy]]ard family, prominent in the silk trade; his wife was a descendant of the poet and dramatist [[Hannah Cowley]].&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

Burnand was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], where, aged fifteen, he wrote a [[farce]], ''Guy Fawkes Day'', played at [[William Cookesley|Cookesley]]'s house, and subsequently at the Theatre Royal, [[Worthing]].&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U194179 "Burnand, Sir Francis Cowley"], ''Who Was Who'', online edition, Oxford University Press, 2014, accessed 7 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; While at Eton, he submitted some illustrations to the comic weekly magazine, ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', one or two of which were published. In 1854 he went to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where as an undergraduate he sought the approval of the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|Vice-Chancellor]], [[Edwin Guest]], of the establishment of a [[Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club]], with a performance of ''[[Box and Cox (farce)|Box and Cox]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Burnand, pp. 7–17&lt;/ref&gt; Guest and his colleagues refused their consent, but Burnand went ahead without it. The members of the club performed a triple bill under stage names to avoid retribution from the university. The club prospered (and continues to the present day); Burnand acted and wrote plays under the name Tom Pierce.&lt;ref&gt;Burnand, pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnand graduated in 1858. His family had expected that he would study for the [[Barrister|bar]], but the Burnands held the right to appoint the [[vicar|incumbent]] of a [[Church of England]] parish that became vacant, and it was agreed that he should train for the priesthood.&lt;ref name=aam&gt;Milne, A. A. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/olddnb/32183 "Burnand, Sir Francis Cowley (1836–1917)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' Archive, Oxford University Press, 1927, accessed 8 June 2014 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enrolled at [[Ripon College Cuddesdon|Cuddesdon]] theological college, where his studies of divinity led him to leave the Anglican church and become a [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name=aam/&gt; This caused a breach between Burnand and his father, but the estrangement did not last long. To the disappointment of [[Henry Edward Manning|Cardinal Manning]], leader of the English Catholics, Burnand announced that his vocation was not for the church but for the theatre.&lt;ref name=aam/&gt; Father and son were reconciled, and Burnand returned to his original plan of reading for the bar at [[Lincoln's Inn]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Death of Sir Francis Burnand", ''[[The Times]]'', 23 April 1917, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===1860s: start of writing career===
[[File:F C Burnand Charicatures Shakespeare.png|right|thumb|upright|Burnand as Mr Punch, ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'''s mascot]]
In February 1860 Burnand had his first piece performed in the [[West End theatre|West End]], ''Dido the Celebrated Widow'', a [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesque]] of ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'', played at the [[St James's Theatre]].&lt;ref name=nicoll288&gt;Nicoll, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; The following month he married an actress, Cecilia Victoria Ranoe (1841–1870), daughter of James Ranoe, a clerk; the couple had five sons and two daughters. He was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] in 1862, and practised for a short time, but his main interest was in writing. In the early 1860s, he edited the short-lived journal ''The Glow-Worm'' and then joined the staff of ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'', edited by [[Henry James Byron|H. J. Byron]]. He parted company with Byron when the magazine rejected his proposed 1863 [[burlesque (literary)|literary burlesque]] of a [[George W. M. Reynolds|Reynolds]] serial, entitled ''Mokeanna, or the White Witness''. He showed his manuscript to [[Mark Lemon]], editor of ''Punch'', who accepted it for publication; Burnand remained a ''Punch'' writer for the rest of his career.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;{{refn|[[W. S. Gilbert]], later Burnand's rival as a comic playwright, made the opposite journey, severing his connection with ''Punch'' in favour of ''Fun'' when Lemon turned down one of Gilbert's ''[[Bab Ballads]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Two Great English Humorists – Gilbert and Burnand", ''The Times'', 18 November 1936, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

''Dido'' was followed by ''The Îles of St Tropez'' (1860), ''Fair Rosamond'' (1862) and ''The Deal Boatman'' (1863), among many others.&lt;ref name=Parker84&gt;Parker, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; His most memorable early success was another musical burlesque, ''[[Ixion]], or the Man at the Wheel'' (1863), starring [[Lydia Thompson]] in the title role, which found audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. By this time Burnand was a skilled negotiator with theatre managements, and he was among the first authors to insist on profit-sharing instead of fixed royalties. For ''Ixion'' this brought him a total of around £3,000.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early works included an [[opéra bouffe]], ''Windsor Castle'' (1865), with music by Frank Musgrave, and more pun-filled burlesques, including ''[[Helen of Troy|Helen]], or, Taken from the Greek'', and ''[[Guy Fawkes]], or The Ugly Mug and the Couple of Spoons'', both in 1866.&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; Later in 1866 Burnand had a huge success with the burlesque ''The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up'', parodying the three-act melodrama by [[Douglas Jerrold]], ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'';&lt;ref name=Susan&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ts5ZAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA51 "''The Morning Post''"], ''Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up'', review in ''The Morning Post'', digitized by The British Library (2013), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; the show ran for 400 nights at the [[Royalty Theatre]], was played for years provincially and in the US, and was twice revived in London.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker84/&gt;

[[File:Black eyed See-Usan - Weir Collection.jpg|upright|thumb|Theatre poster for Burnard's ''Black Eyed See-Usan'']]
In 1866, Burnand adapted the popular farce ''Box and Cox'' as a [[comic opera]], ''[[Cox and Box]]'', with music by the young composer [[Arthur Sullivan]]. The piece was written for a private performance but was repeated and given its first public performance at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew. "Cox and Box" &amp;ndash; A Postscript", ''The Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Journal'', 1968, volume IX, 7, pp.132–133; and "Adelphi Theatre", ''The Times'', 13 May 1867, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer for ''Fun'' was [[W. S. Gilbert]], who wrote
{{quote|Mr Sullivan's music is, in many places, of too high a class for the grotesquely absurd plot to which it is wedded. It is very funny, here and there, and grand or graceful when it is not funny; but the grand and the graceful have, we think, too large a share of the honours to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;|}}
''Cox and Box'' became a popular favourite and was frequently revived.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Royal Gallery of Illustration]]", ''The Times'', 30 March 1869, p. 10 "The Theatres", ''The Times'', 15 July 1880, p. 6; "Savoy Theatre", ''The Times'', 11 March 1895, p. 12; and "The Theatres", ''The Times'', 25 August 1921, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only work not by Gilbert in the regular repertory of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] during the 20th century and is the only work of Burnand's still frequently staged.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 15, 140–186 and xxv–xxvi; and [http://www.gloc.org/#/cox-and-box/4584711461 "Cox and Box on tour"], [[Grosvenor Light Opera Company]], accessed 8 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Fredric Woodbridge Wilson. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/46774. "Burnand, Sir Francis Cowley"], Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 8 July 2014 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its success encouraged its authors to write the two-act opera, ''[[The Contrabandista]]'' (1867), revised and expanded as ''[[The Chieftain]]'' (1894), but it did not achieve much popularity in either version.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 62; and Rollins and Witts, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

More burlesques followed in 1868, including ''Fowl Play, or, A Story of Chicken Hazard'' and ''The Rise and Fall of Richard III, or, A New Front to an Old Dicky''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1869, Burnand wrote ''The Turn of the Tide'', which was a success at the [[Queen's Theatre]], and six other stage works during the course of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Nicoll, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

===1870s: prolific author===
[[File:Goodoldgaietyhis00holluoft 61.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Burnand, c. 1870s]]
Burnand's wife Cecilia died in 1870 at age 28, leaving him with seven small children. In 1874 Burnand married her widowed sister, Rosina (d. 1924), who was also an actress.&lt;ref name=Susan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp89208/rosina-nee-ranoe-lady-burnand "Rosina (née Ranoe), Lady Burnand"], National Portrait Gallery, accessed 9 July 2014. She had appeared in, among other things, Burnand's ''Black-Eyed Susan'' and Gilbert's ''[[An Old Score]]'', and had performed together with her sister and Burnand in Burnand's one-act burlesque of ''[[The Odyssey]]'', [http://www.mocavo.com/Sir-Charles-Wyndham-a-Biography-2/116574/59#62 ''Patient Penelope; or, The Return of Ulysses''].&lt;/ref&gt; It was at that time illegal in England for a man to marry his dead wife's sister,{{refn|This became legal in 1907 under the [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907]].|group=n}} although such marriages made outside British jurisdiction were recognised as valid; accordingly the wedding ceremony was performed in continental Europe. There were two sons and four daughters of this marriage.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Throughout the 1870s, Burnand maintained a prodigious output. For the stage he wrote 55 pieces, ranging from burlesques to [[pantomime]]s, farces and [[extravaganza]]s.&lt;ref name=nicoll289&gt;Nicoll, pp. 289–291&lt;/ref&gt; He was the sole author of most of them, but worked on a few with [[Thomas German Reed]], [[James Lynam Molloy|J. L. Molloy]], [[Henry Pottinger Stephens]] and even with H. J. Byron.&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; His stage pieces of the 1870s included ''Poll and Partner Joe'' (1871),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''Penelope Anne'' (1871; a sequel to ''Cox and Box''),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''The Miller and His Man'' (1873; "a Christmas drawing room extravaganza" with songs by Sullivan),&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, Paul. [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/sullivan/miller/index.html ''The Miller and His Man''], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 2 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ''Artful Cards'' (1877),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''Proof'' (1878),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''Dora and Diplunacy'' (1878, a burlesque of [[Clement Scott]]'s ''Diplomacy'', an adaptation of [[Victorien Sardou|Sardou]]'s ''Dora''),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''[[The Forty Thieves]]'' (1878; a charity collaboration among four playwrights, including Byron and Gilbert),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''Our Club'' (1878)&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; and another frequently revived hit, ''Betsy'' (1879).&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker84/&gt; He provided a burlesque of ''Robbing Roy'' to the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''The Times'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Burnand's prolific writing came at some cost in quality. A biographer wrote that he "was a facile and slapdash writer. False rhymes and awkward rhythms occur frequently in his verse, and his favourite devices included puns, topical references and slang."&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

Burnand also translated or adapted for the London stage several French operettas by [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]], [[Edmond Audran]], [[Charles Lecocq]] and [[Robert Planquette]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; At the same time as his busy theatrical career, he was a member of the staff of ''Punch'' under Lemon and his successors, [[Shirley Brooks]] and [[Tom Taylor]], writing a regular stream of genial articles.&lt;ref name=aam/&gt; His best-known work for the magazine was the column "Happy Thoughts", in which the narrator recorded the difficulties and distractions of everyday life. [[A. A. Milne]] considered it "one of the most popular series which has ever appeared in ''Punch''"; alongside it, he rated as Burnand's best comic contributions his burlesques of other writers, such as "The New History of Sandford and Merton" (1872) and "Strapmore" by "Weeder" (1878).&lt;ref name=aam/&gt;{{refn|These parodied ''[[The History of Sandford and Merton]]'' by [[Thomas Day]], a moralising work for children; and ''Strathmore'', a novel by [[Ouida]], in his burlesque of which Burnand parodied two genres: novels of high society and Italian peasant stories.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors whom he satirised included [[Victor Hugo]], presented in ''Punch'' as "Fictor Nogo".&lt;ref&gt;Spielmann, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

===1880s: editor of ''Punch''===
[[File:J L Toole as Paw Claudian.jpg|thumb|upright|[[J. L. Toole]] in Burnand's ''Paw Claudian'', 1884]]
The third editor of ''Punch'', Tom Taylor, died in July 1880; the proprietors of the magazine appointed Burnand to succeed him. In Milne's view the magazine's reputation increased considerably under Burnand:
{{quote|It grew less intolerant of opinions with which it disagreed; it became more catholic in its appeal; it began to discard its air of a Family Joke and aspired to be the National Institution which it has since been proclaimed. Yet he always kept for it a note of irresponsibility.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;|}}
A later biographer, Jane Stedman, writes, "His predecessor, Tom Taylor, had allowed the paper to become heavy, but Burnand's rackety leadership brightened it."  Burnand, who declared himself "hostile to no man's religion", banned ''Punch'''s previous anti-Catholicism, although he was unable to prevent some antisemitic jokes.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

One of Burnand's biggest successes, both in ''Punch'' and on stage, was satire of the [[aesthetic movement]]. His play ''[[The Colonel (play)|The Colonel]]'' (1881), based on ''The Serious Family'', a play by Morris Barnett, ran for 550 performances and toured extensively. It made so much money for the actor-manager Edgar Bruce that he was able to build the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]]. Burnand rushed ''The Colonel'' into production to make sure that it opened several months before [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s similarly themed comic opera, ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Burnand, 2nd Edition, vol. 2, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; but ''Patience'' ran even longer than ''The Colonel''.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oscar Wilde]], no fan of Burnand's farces, wrote, in anticipation of seeing ''Patience'': "With Gilbert and Sullivan I am sure we will have something better than the dull farce of ''The Colonel''".&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, p. 109, letter to [[George Grossmith]], April 1881&lt;/ref&gt; For the Gaiety Theatre, Burnand wrote a burlesque of ''[[The Tempest]]'' entitled ''Ariel'' in October 1883, with music by [[Meyer Lutz]], starring [[Nellie Farren]] and [[Arthur Williams (actor)|Arthur Williams]]. ''[[The Times]]'' complained of the "flatness and insipidity" of Burnand's text and of his vulgarising the original.&lt;ref&gt;"Gaiety Theatre", ''The Times'', 9 October 1883, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' was less censorious, finding the piece moderately amusing, and correctly predicting that it would run successfully until it had to make way for the annual Gaiety pantomime at Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;"At the Play", ''The Observer'', 14 October 1883, p. 7; and "Theatres", ''The Times', 8 December 1883, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, Burnand wrote ''Paw Claudian'', a burlesque of the 1883 costume (Byzantine) drama ''Claudian'' by Henry Herman and W. G. Wills, presented at [[Toole's Theatre]] starring [[J. L. Toole]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; The same year, he wrote a burlesque of ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'', called ''Black Eyed See-Usan'', for the [[Alhambra Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5OE4AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA220 "Dramatic Gossip"], ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]: A Journal'', 16 August 1884, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Burnand wrote several musical works around 1889 and 1890 with the composer [[Edward Solomon]], including ''Pickwick'', which was revived in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Simon. [http://www.c20th.com/GSarchiveother.htm Programme and description of 1894 production], Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, a selling exhibition of memorabilia, Archive: Other items, accessed 9 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pickwick'' was recorded by Retrospect Opera in 2016, together with [[George Grossmith]]'s ''[[Cups and Saucers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, David.

===Later years===
[[File:Chieftain poster 1894.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Poster for the original production of ''[[The Chieftain]]'', 1894]]
In 1890, Burnand wrote ''Captain Therèse,'' followed later that year by a very successful English version of Audran's operetta, ''La cigale et la fourmi'' (the grasshopper and the ant) retitled ''La Cigale'', with additional music by [[Ivan Caryll]].&lt;ref&gt;"Lyric Theatre", ''The Times'', 10 October 1890, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, he produced an English adaptation of Audran's ''Miss Helyett'', retitled as ''Miss Decima''. Burnand's ''The Saucy Sally'' premiered in 1892, and ''Mrs Ponderbury's Past'' played in 1895. Burnand's 1897 comic opera, ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'', with music by [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], failed despite the contributions of the lyricist [[Adrian Ross]] and a [[Savoy Theatre]] cast including [[Ilka Pálmay]], [[George Grossmith]] and [[Walter Passmore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_savoy/his_majesty/his_majesty_home.html "''His Majesty''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901175437/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_savoy/his_majesty/his_majesty_home.html |date=1 September 2006 }}, Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 9 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The blame was generally held to be Burnand's. ''[[The Times]]'' commented, "Mr Burnand's experience as a librettist of comic opera, and Sir Alexander Mackenzie's inexperience in this class of composition might lead the public to expect a brilliant book weighed down by music of too serious and ambitious a type. The exact opposite is the case." Burnand's libretto was judged dull and confused, but Mackenzie's music was "marked by distinction as well as humour."&lt;ref&gt;"Savoy Theatre", ''The Times'', 22 February 1897, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Stedman comments that Burnand's conviction that he, not Gilbert, should have been Sullivan's main collaborator defied the facts: ''The Chieftain'', his rewrite of ''The Contrabandista'' with Sullivan, ran for only 97 performances in 1894, and ''His Majesty'' managed only 61 performances.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Burnand used his position as editor of ''Punch'' to print antagonistic reviews of the plays of Gilbert and refused to give the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas reviews in the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss, Harry. ''The Two Pins Club'' (1925), excerpted in ''The Gilbert Society Journal'', pp. 315–316, vol. 1, no. 10, Spring 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnand's last stage works were a collaboration with J. Hickory Wood, at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 1905, on a pantomime of ''[[Cinderella]]'', and he was partly responsible for a pantomime of ''Aladdin'' for the same theatre in 1909.&lt;ref name=Parker84/&gt; His later contributions to ''Punch'' became increasingly wordy and anecdotal, relying on far-fetched puns, but he was a good judge of talent, and under him the paper prospered.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; Stedman rates as a high point of his editorship the publication of ''[[The Diary of a Nobody]]'' by the brothers George and [[Weedon Grossmith]], which was soon turned into book form and has never been out of print.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He was reluctant to retire, but was persuaded to do so in 1906, and was succeeded by [[Owen Seaman]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1908, Burnand became the editor of ''The Catholic Who's Who'', published by [[Burns &amp; Oates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecatholicuniverse.com/pdf/burnand.pdf ""Burns &amp; Oates"], ''The Universe'', January 8, 1909, accessed July 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnand lived for much of his life in [[Ramsgate]], Kent, on the south coast of England and was a member of the [[Garrick Club]] in London.&lt;ref name=Parker84/&gt; He had a very large circle of friends and colleagues who included [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], Mark Lemon and most writers, dramatists and actors of the day.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; George Grossmith wrote:
{{quote|I think Frank Burnand is the most amusing man to meet. He is brimful of good humour. He will fire off joke after joke, and chaff you out of your life if he gets a chance. His chaff is always good-tempered. No one minds being chaffed by Burnand. I will not sing a song when he is in the room if I can possibly help it. He will sit in front of me at the piano, and either stare with a pained and puzzled look during my comic song, or he will laugh in the wrong places, or, what is worse still, take out his pocket-handkerchief and weep."&lt;ref&gt;Grossmith, Ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

After a winter of bronchitis, Burnand died in 1917 at his home in Ramsgate, at the age of 80. He was buried in the cemetery at St Augustine's Abbey church in Ramsgate.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

'''Flora Caroline Twort''' (24 June 1893 &amp;ndash; 1985) was an English painter who specialised in [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]]s and [[pastel]]s of the scenes and people of [[Petersfield, Hampshire|Petersfield]], [[Hampshire]].

==Biography==
Twort was born on 24 June 1893 in [[Yeovil]], [[Somerset]]. Her parents were [[Albert Samuel Twort]] and Jane Rapley.&lt;ref name=Birth&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldconnect.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=turte_twort&amp;id=P972 |title=Ancestry chart of John Turte &amp; Katerina Holmsby |publisher=Rootsweb |accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twort began painting at the age of four, and was educated at the [[South Hampstead High School]],&lt;ref&gt;Who was Flora Twort?, HantsWeb biography&lt;/ref&gt; [[London School of Art]], the [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]] and the [[Slade School of Art]]. At the end of [[World War I]] she moved to Petersfield, where she ran a secondhand bookshop at Numbers 1 and 2 The Square, in partnership with two other young women. The shop also sold handmade jewellery, pottery and textiles and gained a reputation as one of the finest book shops in the South of England. In 1934 she joined the [[Society of Women Artists]].&lt;ref name=cook&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=Jean H |date=1998 |title=Famous Women of Hampshire |publisher=Happy Walking International |pages=34-35 |isbn=1874754675}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Her studio was above this shop until 1948, when the three partners decided to give up the shop and Twort moved to a studio in the nearby Church Path. Her work was exhibited in the [[Royal Academy]] and other London galleries, and she continued to paint until she was 81.

Her pictures, usually watercolours, typically contain local scenes of Petersfield which are filled with people and animals, with such subjects as The Square on Market Day, or the fair on Petersfield Heath. She also produced drawings in pencil, crayon, charcoal and pastel, including some fine portraits.

Twort was a friend of [[Nevil Shute]], who in 1925 proposed marriage to her, unsuccessfully, though they remained lifelong friends &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nevilshute.org/TimeLine/timeline1921-1930.php Timeline 1921-1930], Neville Shute Norway Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; and she became godmother to his daughter Shirley Anne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nevilshute.org/TimeLine/timeline1931-1940.php Timeline 1931-1940], Neville Shute Norway Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; For a short period in 1939, Shute and his family lived at The Old Mill at [[Langstone, Hampshire|Langstone]], which she owned.

On her death she bequeathed her studio cottage and pictures to [[Hampshire County Council]]. A selection of her pictures is now displayed in her old studios, which have become the 
[[Flora Twort Gallery]]; the selection is changed twice per year. Hampshire County Council has also put 600 of her pictures online.

[[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] '''Garnet Joseph Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|KP|GCB|OM|GCMG|VD|PC}} (4 June 1833{{snd}}25 March 1913), was an [[Anglo-Irish]] officer in the [[British Army]]. He became one of the most influential and admired British generals after a series of successes in Canada, West Africa, and Egypt, followed by a central role in modernizing the British Army in promoting efficiency.  He served in Burma, the [[Crimean War]], the [[Indian Mutiny]], China, Canada and widely throughout Africa—including his [[Anglo-Ashanti wars|Ashanti]] campaign (1873–1874) and the [[Nile Expedition]] against [[Mahdist War|Mahdist]] Sudan in 1884–85. Wolseley served as [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces]] from 1895 to 1900. His reputation for efficiency led to the late 19th century English phrase "everything's all Sir Garnet", meaning, "All is in order."&lt;ref name="FarmerHenley1903"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=John Stephen|last2=Henley|first2=W.E.|title=Slang and Its Analogues Past and Present: A Dictionary ... with Synonyms in English, French ...

==Early life and education ==
Lord Wolseley was born into a prominent [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] family in [[Dublin]], the eldest son of [[Major (British Army)|Major]] Garnet Joseph Wolseley of the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]] ([[25th Foot]]) and Frances Anne Wolseley (''née'' Smith). The Wolseleys were an ancient landed family in [[Wolseley, Staffordshire|Wolseley]], [[Staffordshire]], whose roots can be traced back a thousand years.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news |title=Death of Lord Wolseley |work=[[The Times]] |publisher=The Times Digital Archive |page=7 |date=26 March 1913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolseley was born at Golden Bridge House, the seat of his mother's family. His paternal grandfather was Rev. William Wolseley, Rector of [[Tullycorbet]], and the third son of  [[Sir Richard Wolseley, 1st Baronet]], who sat in the [[Irish House of Commons]] for [[Carlow Borough (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Carlow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage|date=1885|publisher=Burke's Peerage Limited|page=1425|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6u8_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1425|accessdate=28 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family seat was Mount Wolseley in [[County Carlow]].&lt;ref name="complete"&gt;{{cite book|title=Complete Baronetage: Great Britain and Ireland, 1707-1800, and Jacobite, 1688-1788|date=1906|publisher=W. Pollard &amp; Company, Limited|pages=356–357|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMpKAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA356|accessdate=28 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had four younger sisters and two younger brothers,  [[Frederick Wolseley]] (1837–1899) and Sir [[George Wolseley]] (1839–1921).&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

Wolseley's father died in 1840 at age 62, leaving his widow and seven children to struggle on his Army pension. Unlike other boys in his class, Wolseley was not sent to England to attend [[Harrow School|Harrow]] or [[Eton College|Eton]], but was instead educated at a local school in Dublin. The family circumstance forced Wolseley to leave school at just 14, when he found work in a [[Surveying|surveyor]]'s office, which helped him bring in a salary and continue studying maths and geography.&lt;ref name="mason"&gt;{{cite web|title=Field Marshal Garnet Joseph Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley, KP, GCB, OM, GCMG, VD, PC.|url=http://www.irishmasonichistory.com/field-marshal-garnet-joseph-wolseley-1st-viscount-wolseley-kp-gcb-om-gcmg-vd-pc.html|website=Irish Masonic History and the Jewels of Irish Freemasonry|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36995?docPos=1|title=Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolseley first considered a career in the church, but his financial situation meant that he would have needed a wealthy patron to support such an endeavor. Instead he sought a [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]] in the Army. Unable to afford [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] or [[Sale of commissions|buying a commission]], Wolseley wrote to the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] for assistance. Wellington, then the [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces]], promised to assist him when he turned 16.&lt;ref name="mason"/&gt; However, Wellington apparently overlooked him and did not respond to another letter sent when he was 17. Wolseley unsuccessfully appealed to his secretary, [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]]. The British Army was then recovering from significant casualties in the latest [[Xhosa Wars|war in South Africa]], and Wolseley wrote Raglan, "I shall be prepared to start at the shortest notice, should your Lordship be pleased to appoint me to a regiment now at the seat of war."&lt;ref name="mason"/&gt; His mother then wrote the Duke again to appeal his case, and on 12 March 1852, the 18-year-old Wolseley was gazetted as an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[Suffolk Regiment|12th Foot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=21300|page=768|date=12 March 1852}}&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of his father's service.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Second Burmese War==

Just a month after he joined the [[Suffolk Regiment|12th Foot]], Wolseley transferred to the [[80th Regiment of Foot (Staffordshire Volunteers)|80th Foot]] on 13 April 1852,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=21309|page=1058|date=13 April 1852|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he served in the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]].&lt;ref name=heath&gt;{{harvnb|Heathcote|p=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was severely wounded when he was shot in the left thigh with a [[jingal]] bullet on 19 March 1853 in the attack on Donabyu,&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name=heath/&gt; and was [[mentioned in despatches]]. Promoted to [[lieutenant]] on 16 May 1853 and invalided home, Wolseley transferred to the [[84th (York and Lancaster) Regiment of Foot|84th Regiment of Foot]] on 27 January 1854,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=21515|page=232|date=27 January 1854|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then to the [[90th Regiment of Foot (Perthshire Volunteers)|90th Light Infantry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=21526|page=642|date=24 February 1854|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; at that time stationed in [[Dublin]], on 24 February 1854.&lt;ref name=heath/&gt; He was promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 29 December 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=21645|page=4259|date=29 December 1854|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimea==
Wolseley accompanied the regiment to [[Crimean War|the Crimea]], and landed at [[Balaklava]] in December 1854. He was selected to be an assistant [[Military engineer|engineer]], and attached to the [[Royal Engineers]] during the [[Crimean War#Siege of Sevastopol|Siege of Sevastopol]]. Wolseley served throughout the siege, where he was wounded at "the Quarries" on 7 June 1855, and again in the trenches on 30 August 1855, losing an eye.&lt;ref name=heath/&gt;

After the fall of [[Sevastopol]], Wolseley was employed on the [[quartermaster-general]]'s staff, assisting in the embarkation of the troops and supplies, and was one of the last British soldiers to leave the Crimea in July 1856.&lt;ref name=heath/&gt;  For his services he was twice mentioned in despatches, received the war medal with clasp, the 5th class of the French ''[[Légion d'honneur]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=21909|page=2699|date=4 August 1856|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 5th class of the Turkish [[Order of the Medjidie]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Wolseley, Garnet Joseph Wolseley, Viscount|volume=28|pages=777–778}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22107|page=1264|date=2 March 1858|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months after joining the [[90th Foot]] at [[Aldershot]], he went with it in March 1857 to join the troops being despatched for the [[Second Opium War]].&lt;ref name=heath/&gt; Wolseley was embarked in the transport ''Transit'', which wrecked in the [[Bangka Strait|Strait of Banka]]. The troops were all saved, but with only their personal arms and minimal ammunition. They were taken to [[Singapore]], and from there dispatched to [[Calcutta]] on account of the [[Indian Mutiny]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tim&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timmonet.co.uk/html/body_wolseley.htm|title=A Victorian Army Hero|publisher=Timmonet|accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian Mutiny of 1857==
[[File:Felice Beato (British, born Italy - (Lieutenant-Colonel Wolsely, V.C.) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Lieutenant-Colonel Wolseley in India, by [[Felice Beato]], 1858–1859]]
Wolseley distinguished himself at the [[relief of Lucknow]] under Sir [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Colin Campbell]] in November 1857, and in the defence of the [[Alambagh]] position under [[Sir James Outram, 1st Baronet|Outram]],&lt;ref name=heath/&gt; taking part in the actions of 22 December 1857, of 12 January 1858 and 16 January 1858, and also in the repulse of the grand attack of 21 February 1858.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; That March, he served at the final [[siege of Lucknow|siege]] and capture of Lucknow. He was then appointed deputy-assistant quartermaster-general on the staff of Sir [[Hope Grant]]'s [[Oudh]] division,&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; and was engaged in all of the operations of the campaign, including the actions of [[Bari, India|Bari]], [[Purnia division#Sarsi|Sarsi]], [[Kanpur|Nawabganj]], the capture of [[Faizabad]], the passage of the [[Gumti]] and the action of [[Sultanpur, Uttar Pradesh|Sultanpur]]. In the autumn and winter of 1858–59 he took part in the [[Lalganj, Uttar Pradesh|Baiswara]], trans-[[Gogra]] and trans-[[West Rapti River|Rapti]] campaigns ending with the complete suppression of the [[rebellion]].&lt;ref name=tim/&gt;  For his services he was frequently mentioned in dispatches, and having received the [[Indian Mutiny Medal|Mutiny medal]] and clasp, he was promoted to brevet [[major]] on 24 March 1858&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22117|page=1571|date=24 March 1858|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to brevet [[lieutenant-colonel]] on 26 April 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22255|page=1727|date=26 April 1859|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolseley continued to serve on Sir Hope Grant's staff in Oudh, and when Grant was nominated to the [[Chain of command|command]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] troops in the [[Second Opium War|Anglo-French expedition to China]] of 1860,&lt;ref name=heath/&gt; accompanied him as the deputy-assistant quartermaster-general. He was present at the action at [[Sin Ho District|Sin-ho]], the capture of [[Tanggu District|Tang-ku]], the storming of the [[Taku Forts]],&lt;ref name=heath/&gt; the Occupation of [[Tianjin|Tientsin]], the Battle of [[Xilin County|Pa-to-cheau]] and the entry into [[Peking]] (during which the destruction of the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[Chinese Emperor|Imperial]] [[Old Summer Palace]] was begun).&lt;ref name=heath/&gt;  He assisted in the re-embarkation of the troops before the winter set in. He was Mentioned, yet again, in Dispatches, and for his services received the medal and two clasps. On his return home he published the ''Narrative of the War with China'' in 1860.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Narrative_of_the_War_with_China_in_1860.html?id=N1DRr0hocw8C&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Narrative of the War with China|publisher=BiblioBazaar|year=2008|accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given the substantive rank of [[major]] on 15 February 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22480|page=654|date=15 February 1861|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
[[File:Viscount Garnet Joseph Wolseley.jpeg|thumb|right|Field Marshal Viscount Wolseley|250px]]
In November 1861, Wolseley was one of the special service officers sent to [[Canada]] in connection with the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' incident]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

In 1862, shortly after the [[Battle of Antietam]], Wolseley took leave from his military duties and went to investigate the [[American Civil War]]. He befriended [[Confederate States of America|Southern]] sympathizers in [[Maryland]], who found him passage into [[Virginia]] with a [[blockade runner]] across the [[Potomac River]].  There he met with the Generals [[Robert E. Lee]], [[James Longstreet]] and [[Stonewall Jackson]].&lt;ref name=heath/&gt; He also provided an analysis on Lieutenant General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]].  The ''[[New Orleans Picayune]]'' (10 April 1892) published Wolseley's ten-page portrayal of Forrest, which condensed much of what was written about him by biographers of the time.  This work appeared in the ''Journal of the Southern Historical Society'' in the same year, and is commonly cited today.  Wolseley addressed Forrest's role at the [[Battle of Fort Pillow]] near [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]] in April, 1864 in which [[African-American|black]] [[United States Colored Troops|USCT]] troops and [[White people|white]] officers were alleged by some to have been slaughtered after [[Fort Pillow, Tennessee|Fort Pillow]] had been conquered.  Wolseley wrote, "I do not think that the fact that one-half of the small garrison of a place taken by assault was either killed or wounded evinced any very unusual bloodthirstiness on the part of the assailants."&lt;ref&gt;''United Service Magazine'', London, 1892, April and May issues&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolseley returned to Canada where he became a brevet [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] on 5 June 1865&lt;ref name=heath/&gt; and Assistant Quartermaster-General in Canada with effect from the same date.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22992|page=3579|date=18 July 1865|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was actively employed the following year in the defence of Canada from [[Fenian raids]] launched from the [[United States]].  He was appointed Deputy Quartermaster-General in Canada on 1 October 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=23278|page=4045|date=19 July 1867|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869 his ''Soldiers' Pocket Book for Field Service'' was published,&lt;ref name=heath1&gt;{{harvnb|Heathcote|p=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since run through many editions. In 1870, he successfully commanded the [[Wolseley Expedition|Red River Expedition]] to establish Canadian [[sovereignty]] over the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Manitoba]].&lt;ref name=heath1/&gt;  Manitoba had entered [[Canadian Confederation]] when the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] transferred its control of western Canada to the government of the Dominion of Canada.  British and Canadian authorities ignored the pre-existing Government of Assiniboia and botched negotiations with its replacement, the [[Métis people (Canada)|''Métis'']]'s rebel Provisional Government headed by [[Louis Riel]].&lt;ref name=heath1/&gt; The campaign to put down the rebellion was made difficult by the poor communications at the time. [[Fort Garry]] (now [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]]), the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of [[Manitoba]] was a small centre separated from Ontario by the rocks and forests of the Canadian Shield region.  The easiest route to Fort Garry that did not pass through the United States was through a network of rivers and lakes extending for six-hundred miles from [[Lake Superior]], infrequently traversed by non-[[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]]s, and where no supplies were obtainable.&lt;ref name=heath1/&gt; The admirable arrangements made and the careful organization of the transport reflected great credit to the commander (Wolseley), who upon his return home was made a [[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George]] on 22 December 1870,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=23690|page=5873|date=23 December 1870|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] on 13 March 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=23715|page=1378|date=14 March 1871|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed assistant [[adjutant-general]] at the [[War Office]] in 1871 he furthered the [[Cardwell reforms|Cardwell schemes of army reform]].&lt;ref name=heath1/&gt;

==Ashanti==
[[File:Garnet Joseph Wolseley, 1874.png|thumb|250px|Wolseley in 1874, from the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'']]

In 1873, Wolseley commanded the expedition to [[Ashanti Empire|the Ashanti]], and, having made all his arrangements at the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] before the arrival of the troops in January 1874, was able to complete the campaign in two months,&lt;ref name=heath1/&gt; and re-embark them for home before the unhealthy season began.  This campaign made him a household name in Britain.  At the [[Battle of Amoaful]] on 31 January of that year Wolseley's expedition faced the numerically superior Chief Amankwatia's army in a four-hour battle.  They advanced through thick bush in loose squares, and after five days' fighting, ending with the [[Battle of Ordashu]], entered the capital [[Kumasi]], which he burned.  He received the thanks of both houses of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and a grant of £25,000, was promoted to brevet [[major-general]] for distinguished service in the field on 1 April 1874,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24082|page=1924|date=31 March 1874|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; received the medal and clasp and was made [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George]] on 31 March 1874,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24083|page=1971|date=3 April 1874|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]]. The [[freedom of the city]] of [[City of London|London]] was conferred upon him with a sword of honour, and he was made honorary DCL of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and LL.D of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] universities. On his return home he was appointed [[inspector-general]] of [[Auxiliaries|auxiliary forces]] with effect from 1 April 1874;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24085|page=2061|date=10 April 1874|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in consequence of the indigenous unrest in [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], he was sent to that colony as governor and general-commanding on 24 February 1875.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24184|page=810|date=26 February 1875|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolseley accepted a seat on the [[Council of India]] in November 1876 and was promoted to the substantive rank of [[major-general]] on 1 October 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24508|page=5460|date=2 October 1877|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been promoted to brevet [[lieutenant-general]] on 25 March 1878,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24574|page=2638|date=19 April 1878|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; he went as high-commissioner to the newly acquired possession of [[Cyprus]] on 12 July 1878,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24605|page=4154|date=16 July 1878|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the following year to South Africa to supersede [[Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] in command of the forces in the [[Zulu War]],&lt;ref name=heath1/&gt; and as governor of [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] and the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] and the [[High Commissioner]] of [[Southern Africa]].  Wolseley with his 'Ashanti Ring' of adherents was sent to [[Durban]].  But on arrival in July, he found that the war in [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] was practically over,&lt;ref name=heath1/&gt; and, after effecting a temporary settlement, he went on to the Transvaal. He was promoted to brevet [[general]] while serving in South Africa on 4 June 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24730|page=3731|date=3 June 1879|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having reorganized the administration there and reduced the powerful [[tribal chief|King]], [[Sekhukhune]], to submission, he returned to London in May 1880.  For his services in South Africa he was awarded the [[South Africa Medal (1877)|South Africa Medal]] with clasp, and was advanced to [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] on 19 June 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24857|page=3587|date=22 June 1880|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally as if to signify a meteoric rise in Imperial esteem he was appointed [[Quartermaster-General to the Forces]] on 1 July 1880.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24838|page=2727|date=27 April 1880|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 1882, Wolseley was appointed [[Adjutant-General to the Forces]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25084|page=1131|date=14 March 1882|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in August of that year, given command of the British forces in [[Egypt]] under [[Khedive Tewfik]] to suppress the [[Urabi Revolt]].&lt;ref name=heath2&gt;{{harvnb|Heathcote|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having seized the [[Suez Canal]], he then disembarked his troops at [[Ismailia]] and, after a very short campaign, completely defeated [[Ahmed 'Urabi|Urabi Pasha]] at the [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir]], thereby suppressing yet another rebellion.&lt;ref name=heath2/&gt; For his services, he was promoted to the substantive rank of [[general (British Army)|general]] on 18 November&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25169|page=5173|date=17 November 1882|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised to the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom|peerage]] as '''Baron Wolseley''', of [[Cairo]] and of [[Wolseley, Staffordshire|Wolseley]] in the County of Stafford.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; He also received the thanks of Parliament and [[Egypt Medal|the Egypt Medal]] with clasp;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25170|page=5195|date=21 November 1882|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Order of Osmanieh]], First Class, as bestowed by the [[Khedive]];&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25168|page=5106|date=17 November 1882|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the more dubious accolade of a composition in his honour by [[poetaster]] [[William Topaz McGonagall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcgonagall-online.org.uk/gems/the-battle-of-tel-el-kebir|title=The Battle of Tel-el-Kebir|publisher=Mcgonagall|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 1884, Wolseley was again called away from his duties as adjutant-general, to command the [[Nile Expedition]] for the relief of [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]] and the besieged garrison at [[Khartoum]].  Wolseley's unusual strategy was to take an expedition by boat up the Nile and then to cross the desert to Khartoum, while the naval boats went on to Khartoum.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25394|page=4040|date=9 September 1884|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition arrived too late; Khartoum had been taken, and Gordon was dead.&lt;ref name=heath2/&gt; In the spring of 1885, complications with [[Imperial Russia]] over the [[Panjdeh Incident]] occurred, and the withdrawal of that particular expedition followed.  For his services there, he received two clasps to his Egyptian medal, the thanks of Parliament,&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; and on 28 September 1885 was created '''Viscount Wolseley''', of Wolseley in the County of Stafford,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25514|page=4515|date=25 September 1885|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cokayne|first1=George Edward|title=Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct, Or Dormant|date=1898|publisher=G.

Wolseley continued at the War Office as [[Adjutant-General to the Forces]] until 1890, when he became [[Commander-in-Chief, Ireland]].&lt;ref name=heath2/&gt; He was promoted to be a [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] on 26 May 1894,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26516|page=3117|date=26 May 1894|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Her Majesty's Government|government]] to succeed the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] as [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces]] on 1 November 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26676|page=5923|date=1 November 1895|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the position to which his great experience in the field and his previous signal success at the War Office itself had fully entitled him, but it was increasingly irrelevant.  Field Marshal Viscount Wolseley's powers in that office were, however, limited by a new [[Order in Council]], and after holding the appointment for over five years, he handed over the command-in-chief to his fellow field marshal, [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Earl Roberts]], on 3 January 1901.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27263|page=83|date=4 January 1901|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also suffered from a serious illness in 1897, from which he never fully recovered.&lt;ref name=heath2/&gt;

The unexpectedly large force required for the initial phase of the [[Second Boer War]], was mainly furnished by means of the system of reserves Wolseley had originated—but the new conditions at the War Office were not to his liking.  The fiasco now called [[Black Week]] culminated in his dismissal over Christmastide 1900.&lt;!-- the festival period was known as "Christmastide", as in Whitsuntide. --&gt;  Upon being released from responsibilities he brought the whole subject before the [[House of Lords]] in a speech.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1901/mar/04/war-office-administration-duties-of#S4V0090P0_19010304_HOL_56|title=War Office Administration – Duties of Commander-in-Chief|publisher=Hansard|date=4 March 1901|accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Wolseley was [[Gold Stick and Silver Stick|Gold Stick in Waiting]] to Queen Victoria and took part in the funeral procession following the death of Queen Victoria in February 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27316 |supp=1|page=3552|date=22 May 1901|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as Gold Stick in Waiting to [[Edward VII|King Edward]] during his [[Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra|coronation]] in August 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Coronation |day_of_week=Thursday |date=31 July 1902 |page_number=8 |issue=36834| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honorific and royal appointments===
[[File:Arms of Viscount Wolseley.svg|thumb|Arms of Viscount Wolseley: ''Argent, a talbot passant gules, a mullet, for difference'']]
In early 1901, Lord Wolseley was appointed by [[Edward VII|King Edward]] to lead a special diplomatic mission to announce the King's accession to the governments of [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The King – the special Embassies |day_of_week=Saturday |date=23 March 1901 |page_number=12 |issue=36410}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his visit to [[Constantinople]], the Sultan presented him with the [[Order of Osmanieh]] set in brilliants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The King´s accession |day_of_week=Friday |date=12 April 1901 |page_number=3 |issue=36427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was among the original recipients of the [[Order of Merit]] in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list published on 26 June 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Coronation Honours |day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36804| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and received the order from King Edward VII at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 8 August 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular |day_of_week=Saturday |date=9 August 1902 |page_number=6 |issue=36842| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27470|page=5679|date=2 September 1902| |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his service with the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]], he was awarded the [[Volunteer Decoration|Volunteer Officers' Decoration]] on 11 August 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27586|page=5078|date=11 August 1903|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also honorary colonel of the 23rd [[Middlesex Regiment]] from 12 May 1883,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25229|page=2500|date=11 May 1883|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; honorary colonel of the Queen's Rifle Volunteer Brigade, the [[Royal Scots]] (Lothian Regiment) from 24 April 1889,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25926|page=2294|date=23 April 1889|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; colonel of the [[Royal Horse Guards]] from 29 March 1895&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26624|page=2774|date=14 May 1895|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and colonel-in-chief of the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684–1922)|Royal Irish Regiment]] from 20 July 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26988|page=4354|date=19 July 1898|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In retirement, he was a member of the council of the [[Union-Castle Steamship Line|Union-Castle Steamship Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=New Castle liner Walmer Castle |day_of_week=Saturday |date=15 March 1902 |page_number=11 |issue=36716| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Channel Tunnel==
[[File:LionCannotFaceTheCrowingOfCock.png|thumb|left|250px|General Wolseley riding on the fleeing lion. Published in the American Humor Magazine "Puck" (approx. 1885).]]
Wolseley was deeply opposed to [[Edward Watkin|Sir Edward Watkin]]'s attempt to build a [[Channel Tunnel]]. He gave evidence to a parliamentary commission that the construction might be "calamitous for England", he added that "No matter what fortifications and defences were built, there would always be the peril of some continental army seizing the tunnel exit by surprise." Various contrivances to satisfy his objections were put forward including looping the line on a viaduct from the [[White Cliffs of Dover|Cliffs of Dover]] and back into them, so that the connection could be bombarded at will by the [[Royal Navy]]. For a combination of reasons over 100 years were to pass before a permanent link was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1929/jan/24/proposed-channel-tunnel |title=Proposed Channel Tunnel|publisher= Hansard|date= 24 January 1929|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
[[File:Ex-libris - Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Ex ibris'' with his coat of arms]]
Wolseley was married in 1867 to Louisa (1843–1920), the daughter of Mr. A. Erskine.&lt;ref name=heath/&gt; His only child, [[Frances Garnet Wolseley, 2nd Viscountess Wolseley|Frances]] (1872–1936) was an author and founded the College for Lady Gardeners at [[Glynde]]. She was [[Beneficiary|heiress]] to the viscountcy under special remainder, but it became extinct after her death.&lt;ref name=heath3/&gt;

In his later years, Lord and Lady Wolseley lived in a [[grace-and-favour]] apartment at [[Hampton Court Palace]]. He and his wife were wintering at Villa Tourrette, [[Menton]] on the [[French Riviera]], where he fell ill with influenza and died on 26 March 1913.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

He was buried on 31 March 1913 in the crypt of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], to music played by the band of the 2nd Battalion [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684–1922)|Royal Irish Regiment]], of which he was the first [[Colonel-in-Chief]].&lt;ref name=heath3&gt;{harvnb|Heathcote|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Campaigns and History of the Royal Irish Regiment'' by Brigadier-General Stannus Geoghegan CB, Blackwood, Edinburgh and London, 1911, updated 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wolseley Barracks]], at [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Ontario]], is a Canadian [[military base]] (now officially known as [[CFB London|ASU London]]), established in 1886.  It is on the site of ''Wolseley Hall'', the first building constructed by a [[Canadian Government]] specifically to house an element of the newly created [[Permanent Active Militia|Permanent Force]]. ''Wolseley Barracks'' has been continuously occupied by the [[Canadian Army]] since its creation, and has always housed some element of ''[[The Royal Canadian Regiment]]''.  At present, Wolseley Hall is occupied by the [[Royal Canadian Regiment Museum]] and ''the Regiment's'' 4th Battalion, among other [[leasehold estate|tenant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|14341|Wolseley Barracks|29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The white pith helmet still worn as part of the full-dress uniform of the RCR (pictured in the caricature above from ''Punch'') is known as a Wolseley helmet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naval-military-press.com/wolseley-helmet-in_pictures-from-omdurman-to-el-alamein.html|title=Wolseley Helmet in pictures From Omdurman to El Alamein|publisher=Naval &amp; Military Press|accessdate=25 February 2012}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolseley is also a Senior Boys house at the [[Duke of York's Royal Military School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doyrms.com/structure.html |title=Structure |publisher=Duke of York's Royal Military School |accessdate=25 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819061447/http://www.doyrms.com/structure.html |archivedate=19 August 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Field Marshal Lord Wolseley is commemorated by a tablet at St Michael and All Angels Church in [[Colwich, Staffordshire|Colwich]], [[Staffordshire]], a short distance from [[Shugborough Hall]] and Wolseley Park at Colwich, near [[Rugeley]]. The church was the burial place of the [[Wolseley baronets]] of Wolseley Park, the ancestral home of the Wolseley family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-443128-parish-church-of-st-michael-and-all-ange|title=Parish Church of St Michael and All Angels, Colwich|publisher=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. S.

The town of [[Wolseley, Western Cape]], South Africa, is named after Sir Garnet Joseph Wolseley. It was established on the farm Goedgevonden in 1875 and attained municipal status in 1955; prior to this it was known as Ceres Road.&lt;ref&gt;"Dictionary of Southern African Place Names" P.E.Raper)

The Sir Garnet pub in the centre of [[Norwich]], overlooking the historic market place and city hall, is named after Field Marshal Lord Wolseley.

Wolseley's uniforms, Field Marshal's baton and souvenirs from his various campaigns are held in the collections of the [[Glenbow Museum]] in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  Wolseley maintained a deep interest in notable individuals in Early Modern European history, and collected items related to many of them (for example, a box from [[Sir Francis Drake]], a watch related to [[Oliver Cromwell]], a funerary badge for [[Admiral Horatio Nelson]] and General [[James Wolfe]]'s snuff box).  These are also held in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glenbow.org/collections/museum/military/famous.cfm |title=Collections &amp; Research &gt; Museum Collections &gt; Military &amp; Mounted Police &gt; Famous People &amp; Battles |publisher=Glenbow |date= |accessdate=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of his success, an expression arose: "'''all Sir Garnet'''" meaning; that everything is in good order.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Partridge, ''A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'', (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/18/army-cut-not-all-sir-garnet-editorial |title=Army cuts: Not 'All Sir Garnet' |author=Guardian editorial board |date=18 July 2011 |work=The Guardian |quote=The Victorian byword for a smart operation of any kind was 'All Sir Garnet'...|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George William Patchett''' was a British motorcycle racer and engineer.

==Career==
In his early career he was a motor cycle racer for motorcycle manufacturers such as [[Brough Superior]], [[McEvoy Motorcycles|McEvoy]] and the Belgian arms company [[FN Herstal|FN]]. At [[Pendine]], Wales he won the Welsh TT in 1925 and the Welsh TT sidecar in 1927 on Brough machines.

In 1930 he was recruited by the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] arms manufacturer [[Frantisek Janecek]], founder of the JAWA motorcycle company. Janecek wanted to build a cheaper motor cycle than their current model. Patchett's contacts with the Villiers company enabled a new JAWA model to be designed around the Villiers 175cc two-stroke engine which proved very popular.&lt;ref name="1959 JAWA 355 - Part One"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.realclassic.co.uk/jawa07041700.html|title = 1959 JAWA 355 - Part One|accessdate = 1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sterling SMG.JPG|thumb|right|9mm Sterling machine-gun Mark IV]]
On the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Patchett returned to England and started work under the auto-engineer [[George Lanchester]] at the [[Sterling Armaments Company]] in Dagenham, Essex, helping to gear up manufacture of the Lanchester sub-machine gun. On his way out of [[Prague]] he managed to throw prototype samples of Janeček's new anti-tank device over the wall of the British Embassy.&lt;ref name="1959 JAWA 355 - Part One"/&gt;

By 1942, he was leading a design team to design a new sub-machine gun to the army's specification which was referred to as the "Patchett Machine Carbine". After successfully taking part in extensive army trials in the late 1940s it was adopted by the British Army to replace the Sten gun and known by them as the 9mm Sterling sub-machine gun [[L2A1]]. A modified version, the [[L2A3]], was the very popular Sterling Mk IV which saw service until the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://world.guns.ru/smg/smg28-e.htm|title = Sterling - Patchett L2A1 (Mk.1) - L2A3 (Mk.4), L34A1 (Mk.5) submachine gun (Great Britain)|accessdate = 1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the British High Court awarded Patchett £116,975 (£{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|116975|1966|r=-1}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) for the British government's use of the machine gun he patented. The same amount was awarded to Sterling, which had sued for half a million pounds. [[George Lloyd-Jacob|Mr. Justice Lloyd-Jacob]] referred to Patchett as "a distinguished inventor and valued designer" in making the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gun inventor gets £116,000 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002135/19660622/152/0009 |accessdate=6 July 2018 |work=Birmingham Daily Post |date=22 June 1966 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hubert George de Burgh-Canning, 2nd Marquess of Clanricarde''' (30 November 1832 &amp;ndash; 12 April 1916) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Protestant Ascendancy|ascendancy nobleman]] and politician.
==Biography==
He was the son of [[Ulick de Burgh, 1st Marquess of Clanricarde]] and his wife Harriet, daughter of British Prime Minister [[George Canning]]. He was unmourned in [[Ireland]], where he had a reputation as one of the worst and most repressive [[absentee landlords]] in the country. His estate in [[Portumna]], [[County Galway]], comprising {{convert|52,000|acre|ha}}, yielded 25,000 sterling yearly in rents paid by 1,900 tenants, and was a main target during the 1887 [[Plan of Campaign]] fought for fair rents by the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. 

Clanricarde's opposition was so obdurate that a minister commented: ''"... what right has Clanricarde to be treated better than a lunatic or an orphan?"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.movinghere.org.uk/galleries/histories/irish/origins/clanricarde_2.htm Notes on Clanricarde during the Campaign]&lt;/ref&gt; The estate papers contain letters from the Earl which provide ample evidence of his heartless attitude. His land agent John Blake was murdered in 1882. In 1888 the Earl wrote to Chief Secretary Balfour ''"the western Irish cannot be kept up to their contracts without the threat of eviction."'' {{cn|date=April 2014}}

Upon the suggestion of [[Arthur Balfour]], the Irish members of parliament submitted a bill to parliament for expropriation of his estates. The Prime Minister, [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman|Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] expressed his approval of the bill and denounced Clanricarde in parliament in language described as 'scathing'. Never had Clanicarde visited his estates, despite the many thousands of families that had been evicted from them during that time, resulting in mass destitution. "So universal is the execration in which this particular nobleman is held by people of every political party that when the question of this bill was put to the vote by the speaker, liberals, liberal unionists and conservatives all voted with the Irish party, only three of the nearly 700 members of the house of Commons opposing the vote, which would otherwise have been unanimous."&lt;ref&gt;Cunliffe-Owen, Margarete ''Letter of Marquis de Fontenoy'', "Chicago Tribune, 18 December 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1891 onwards the [[Congested Districts Board for Ireland|Congested Districts Board]] attempted to compulsorily purchase the estate but were not successful until 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movinghere.org.uk/galleries/histories/irish/origins/clanricarde_1.htm|title=The Clanricarde Estate|publisher=Moving Here|accessdate=4 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his death all his peerages became extinct, save the second creation of the [[Earl of Clanricarde|earldom of Clanricarde]], which passed by special remainder to the [[George Browne, 6th Marquess of Sligo|6th Marquess of Sligo]].

He died in 1916, aged 83, in [[London]], and was buried in [[Highgate Cemetery]], Highgate, London.

[[File:Qulliq 1999-04-01.jpg|thumb|An Inuit woman tending a [[kudlik]].]]
The [[Inuit]] are the most widespread and perhaps the best known [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal people]] on earth.&lt;ref name="Morrison"&gt;Morrison, David. 2004. Inuit Culture. In ''The Oxford Companion to Canadian Histor''y. Gerald Hallowell, ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As a very large indigenous group inhabiting the [[Arctic]] regions of [[Alaska]], [[Canada]], [[Greenland]], and [[Russia]], the Inuit exhibit many variations in cultural practices and customs.

In Inuit communities, the women play a crucial role in the survival of the group. The responsibilities faced by '''Inuit women''' were considered equally as important as those faced by the men. Because of this, the women were given due respect, but are not given an equal share of influence or power.&lt;ref name="Billson" /&gt;

Recent modernization and urbanization has transformed traditional [[Inuit culture]] and influenced the role of women within the culture. These changes include both positive and negative impacts on the overall well-being of Inuit women.&lt;ref name="McElroy" /&gt;

==Role in society==
===Family structure and marriage===
[[File:Madonna of the North.jpg|thumb|"Madonna of the North" (Inuit woman with child on back, {{circa|1912}})]]
In Inuit culture, [[marriage]] was not a choice, but a necessity. Inuit men and women needed each other to survive. Married couples had to work together to overcome nearly impossible living conditions. Because every individual had to rely on a partner to survive, marriages were often arranged at birth to ensure the survival of the family. [[Love marriage]]s, or choice marriages, existed, but these were all but [[arranged marriage|arranged]] because there were usually few eligible partners. A young woman was eligible for marriage after [[puberty]], but a man had to prove he was efficient enough in hunting to support a family before he could marry.&lt;ref name="McElroy" /&gt;

Inuit marriages rarely included large ceremonies; couples were often considered married after the birth of their first child. There were [[Monogamy|monogamous]] and [[Polygamy|polygamous]] marriages, but [[polygyny]] was rare because few men could afford to support multiple wives.&lt;ref name="Morrison" /&gt; Families exchanged gifts before marriages, but no official [[bride price]] or [[dowry]] was paid. Although men were considered the head of the family, both genders could demand a divorce.&lt;ref name="Lowry"&gt;Lowry, Shannon. 1994. Natives of the Far North: Alaska’s Vanishing Culture Through the Eye of Edward Sheriff Curtis. Pennsylvania: Stackpole Books.&lt;/ref&gt; However, divorce was frowned upon because it was bad for the family and the community as a whole.&lt;ref name="Billson"&gt;Billson, Janet Mancini and Kyra Mancini. 2007. ''Inuit Women: Their Powerful Spirit in a Century of Change''. Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spouses were sometimes traded or exchanged, and women had some say in this process. This was a common alternative to divorce because neither family would be without a component vital to its survival — a mother and a wife. In Inuit culture, the family was typically represented by a ''[[kudlik]]'' (lamp) or a hearth, which was the property and responsibility of the wife. This lamp had significant symbolic meaning in the family, the community, and the culture.&lt;ref name="LeMoine"&gt;LeMoine, Genevieve. 2003. Woman of the House: Gender, Architecture, and Ideology in Dorset Prehistory. Arctic Anthropology 40(1): 121–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food production and preparation===
[[Hunting]] and [[fishing]] were the primary sources of food for the Inuit people, and men were traditionally responsible for these duties. Women's duties included gathering other sources of food, such as eggs and berries, and preparing the food the hunters brought back. [[Pinniped|Seals]], [[walrus]], [[whale]]s and [[Reindeer|caribou]] were the most common targets of Inuit hunters. Animals killed by the hunters needed to be butchered and frozen quickly, before they went bad or froze before being butchered. Women were traditionally responsible for the butchering, skinning, and cooking of animals taken by the hunters.&lt;ref name="Friesen"&gt;Friesen, Max T. 1999. Resource Structure, Scalar Stress, and the Development of Inuit Social Organization. ''World Archaeology'' 31(1): 21–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Inuit culture, it was believed that the women's respect for the animals killed during hunting trips, and subsequent care when butchering them, would ensure successful hunts.&lt;ref name="LeMoine" /&gt; Food, as well as other resources, were often shared throughout the community as needed. Women were in charge of the distribution of food to families in the community.&lt;ref name="LeMoine" /&gt;

The Inuit moved with the seasons to maximize their chances of a successful hunt; their entire families often moved with them.&lt;ref name="Morrison" /&gt; Because of this, tools and other items used by the Inuit for hunting and food preparation had to be light and easily transported. Among some Inuit groups this led to the development of complex tools such as light and powerful metal [[harpoon]]s and wood stoves, which were being used by the late 1800s.&lt;ref name="Labrador"&gt;Labrador, Nachvak and Kongu Labrador. 2006. A New Design: When Europeans Met Inuit in Labrador, Home and Hearth Were Reshaped. The Beaver: Exploring Canada’s History 86(3): 26–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children, reproduction, and motherhood===
[[Childbirth]] and [[childcare]] were two of the most important responsibilities for an Inuit woman. Inuit parents showed a very high level of warmth and affection to their children. Inuit children usually began to contribute to the family and community by the age of 12 through activities like picking berries and hunting small game. During this period, they learned skills from their parents through close observation. Learning through observation was the chosen method because it was not practical for children to practice their skills by sewing valuable skins or accompanying men on important hunting trips.&lt;ref name="McElroy" /&gt;

Women raised boys and girls. Men taught boys certain skills, such as hunting, and women taught girls certain skills, such as sewing. Children were named after family members, often ones who recently died. There were no boys and girls names in Inuit culture, so it was common for a girl to have the name of her grandfather, for example.&lt;ref name="Lowry" /&gt;

Children were taught at a young age to listen to their parents and respect their elders, and were treated with more autonomy than non-Inuit children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://kugluktukhighschool.ca/the-inuit-way-a-guide-to.pdf|title=The Inuit Way: A Guide to Inuit Culture|last=|first=|publisher=Pauktuutit|year=2006|isbn=|edition=Revised|location=Ottawa, Ontario|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over disciplining a child was seen as counter productive so children were rarely punished for transgressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://tradition-orale.ca/english/pdf/Childrearing-Practices-E.pdf|title=Interviewing Inuit Elders: Childrearing Practices|last=Ekho|first=Naqi|last2=Ottokie|first2=Uqsuralik|publisher=Nunavut Arctic College|year=2000|isbn=1896204376|editor-last=Briggs|editor-first=Jean|location=Iqaluit, Nunavut|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning was regarded as a partnership between child and adult, with children being more guided through life than directly taught or lectured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nccah-ccnsa.ca/docs/fact%20sheets/child%20and%20youth/Inuit%20caring%20EN%20web.pdf|title=Inunnguiniq: Caring for children the Inuit way|last=|first=|publisher=National Collaborating Centre for Aboriginal Health|year=2009–2010|isbn=|location=|pages=2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adoption was very common in Inuit culture, and it was often very informal. Unwanted babies, or babies a family could not support, could be offered to another family. If the other family accepted, the adoption was complete.&lt;ref name="Kent"&gt;Kent, Heather. 2000. MDs Get Crash Course in Inuit Culture as Young Patients Arrive in Ottawa. Canadian Medical Association Journal 162(10): 1481.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Infanticide]] was common when conditions were desperate and the group was threatened by starvation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8M8aihnBACwC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=inuit+infanticide&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Gr1djRu8yL&amp;sig=quPfEmRFgaVP4T86FdT0_5WO1N0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result Inuit Women: Their Powerful Spirit in a Century of Change] By Janet Mancini Billson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_n22_v146/ai_15952600/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 | work=Science News | first=Bruce | last=Bower | title=Female infanticide: northern exposure – Intuit may have killed one out of every five female babies between 1880 and 1940 – Brief Article | year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mother abandoned an infant in hopes that someone less desperate might find and adopt the child before the cold or animals killed it.

This was seen as best for the culture and prevented the suffering of other family members.

===Other responsibilities ===
Along with childbirth and childcare, women were responsible for sewing skins to make clothes; preserving, processing, and cooking food (as mentioned above); caring for the sick and elderly; and helping to build and take care of the family's shelter.&lt;ref name="Billson" /&gt; Warm, light, and serviceable clothing was perhaps the greatest achievement of the Inuit. For protection against the bitter Arctic winter, it has not been surpassed by even the best modern clothing.&lt;ref name="Morrison" /&gt;

The clothing created by women was vital because life in Arctic conditions was not possible without extremely well-made clothing to protect from the bitter cold. The clothing was created by the careful sewing of animal skins and furs using ivory needles, which were highly valuable in Inuit society. The process of preparing skins to be sewn together for creating clothes was done by women and was an arduous task. Skins had to be scraped, stretched, and softened before they were ready to be sewn.&lt;ref name="Billson" /&gt;

In addition to this, the households Inuit women were expected to help construct and care for could range from [[igloo]]s, to semi-subterranean [[sod house]]s, to [[tent]]s in the summer months.&lt;ref name="LeMoine" /&gt; This required an understanding of complex architectural concepts, as well as the principles of insulation. A good amount of strength was required to construct Inuit shelters. Because of this, Inuit women often worked together and enlisted the help of men to build their homes. For both practical and social purposes, these houses would be built close together or were made large enough for more than one family to live in.&lt;ref name="Friesen" /&gt;

==Status in Inuit culture==
===Sexual division of labour===
Jobs in Inuit culture were not considered men's work or [[women's work]], but the Inuit did believe in men's skills and women's skills. For example, hunting was generally done by the men. Sewing clothes, cooking and preparing food, gathering food outside of hunting, and caring for the home were generally done by women. This does not mean that women never hunted, nor that men never helped with other jobs. This was just how the work was traditionally divided.&lt;ref name="LeMoine" /&gt;

Women hunted and boated for enjoyment or when food was scarce and the community needed extra hunters. Men and women worked together to create a functioning culture. The men would not be able to go hunting without the warm clothes the women sewed for them, and the women would not have enough food without the meat the men brought back from their hunting trips.&lt;ref name="Billson" /&gt;

Because of this, the work done by women received equal respect to the work done by men. While men and women generally did different work, one type of work was not considered better or more important than other types. It is easy to think that because men only had one job that they did less work. The truth is that hunting was extremely physically demanding and time consuming, and often required traveling for days or weeks at a time. As a result, the [[Sexual Division of Labor (Evolutionary Perspective)|sexual division of labour]] in Inuit culture was relatively equal in the amount of work done.&lt;ref name="Billson" /&gt;

===Lack of power and influence===
While women were respected by men, and often treated as equals, they did not have equal power in the community. Important decisions, such as when to [[Human migration|migrate]] and where to, could be made exclusively by men.&lt;ref name="Billson" /&gt; Inuit people had as [[Inuit#Traditional law|little government]] as any group on earth, but some groups did have tribal councils or groups of elders who made decisions for the community. These councils were almost exclusively male.&lt;ref name="Morrison" /&gt;

Because of this, the Inuit women had little to no say in some of their communities' most important decisions. Men usually had the final say in issues such as arranging marriages and adoption or infanticide, which have a huge impact on women's lives. Although women had a relatively high position socially,&lt;ref name="Morrison" /&gt; and had significant control of their own home, as well as ceremonially important jobs such as lighting and tending to lamps and distributing food,&lt;ref name="Labrador" /&gt; their power was usually limited to those areas.

In addition to this, if men were unhappy with how a woman was handling her responsibilities, they could take over or transfer her work to another woman in the community whom they considered more capable. With women having less power, they are often put in difficult positions when they are not involved in the decision-making process. For example, a pregnant woman, or a woman with a newborn child, may not be able to migrate hundreds of miles through Arctic conditions in search of better hunting grounds. Factors such as these are rarely taken into account when men are the sole decision-makers for a community.&lt;ref name="Billson" /&gt;

==Effects of modernization and change on Inuit women==
[[File:Inuit Woman 1907 Crisco edit 2.jpg|thumb|An Inuit ([[Inupiat people|Inupiat]]) woman in traditional clothing, Nome, Alaska, 1907]]
After contact with other cultures, the Inuit were introduced to new technologies and modernization, which changed their lives drastically. The Inuit are now a modern people and, like almost all indigenous peoples, no longer live the way their ancestors did. This is especially true of Inuit women.&lt;ref name="Morrison" /&gt;

===New role in the culture===
After modernization, the Inuit began to move into Arctic towns and participate in [[Wage labour|wage labor]], government employment, community councils, and the acquisition of modern clothing, housing, and vehicles. Male Inuit initially took the lead in assimilation by learning the language of the arriving culture and taking on modern, wage earning jobs; however, a lack of education began to hinder the men's ability to find and keep jobs.&lt;ref name="McElroy"&gt;McElroy, Ann. 1975. Canadian Arctic Modernization and Change in Female Inuit Role Identification. American Ethnologist 2(4): 662–686.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this, women began to lead the way in [[cultural assimilation]]. Women started by finding work as domestic servants, store clerks, hospital aides, classroom assistants, interpreters, and in weaving and knitting shops.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt; Inuit women tend to go to school more than Inuit men, and this is especially true of college. Some universities in regions where the Inuit are prominent, such as the [[Nunavut Arctic College]], have programs designed specifically for the Inuit people. Women, much more often than men, take advantage of these programs.&lt;ref name="Paskey"&gt;Paskey, Janice. 1999. Hunting for Seals and for Inuit Culture at Nunavut Arctic College. Chronicle of Higher Education 46(13): B4&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Inuit women seek more education and, subsequently, better jobs, they have increasingly taken on the role as primary wage earner for the family. This has caused men to assume responsibilities in the house that were traditionally done by the women, such as raising children and keeping the home in order.&lt;ref name="Billson" /&gt;

===Changes in status and power===
The "role reversal" that has begun to occur in Inuit society has given women a major increase in power and influence. Women have begun to seek more power for themselves, both in decision-making in the family and the culture as a whole. As the primary wage earners, working women are now considered the heads of their families and have the upper hand in making decisions for them. This has complicated the relationship between Inuit men and women. Men have begun to resent women for "stealing their rightful place as the head of the family"&lt;ref name="Billson" /&gt; and may turn to [[Alcoholism|drinking]] and/or [[Substance abuse|drug abuse]] to deal with these issues. However, this is not the only reason for men and women to start drinking/gambling/drugs, as you must remember that there has been extensive trauma endured from the 1960s scoop, and Residential schools. It can't all be blamed on woman taking power in a family system. There's lots of support for women to get employed from their family.

Reactions such as these perpetuate the cycle (and misinformation like this perpetuates the cycle), as men are less likely to be employed after exhibiting these behaviors. Another change that has begun is that Inuit women have increasingly started to run for political office. Although the positions they seek are often at the community and local levels, this increase in [[activism]] reflects the new confidence Inuit women have found in the modern world.&lt;ref name="Billson" /&gt;

The second premier of [[Nunavut]] was a woman, [[Eva Aariak]], who was one of two female MLAs in the [[Legislative Assembly of Nunavut]]. The current mayor of [[Iqaluit]], the capital of Nunavut, is a woman, [[Elisapee Sheutiapik]], as is the Member of Parliament for Nunavut, [[Leona Aglukkaq]], who is also the Canadian [[Minister of Health (Canada)|Minister of Health]].

===Health issues===
Scientists have found that the Inuit people seem to experience more illness and health issues than other groups, especially the women and children, and especially in the post-modernization period.&lt;ref name="Kent" /&gt; A possible explanation is that the [[Inuit diet]] was traditionally high in fat and protein and low in fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name="Jorgensen"&gt;Jorgenson, Marit Eika with Helen Moustgaard, Peter Bjerregaard, and Knut Borch-Johnsen. 2006. Gender Differences in the Association between Westernization and Metabolic Risk Among Greenland Inuit. European Journal of Epidemiology 21(10): 741–748.&lt;/ref&gt;

More likely explanations include a change in diet after modernization, a decrease in physical activity as traditional jobs such as hunting and constructing homes are practiced less and less, or exposure to alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. Whatever the cause, [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[heart disease]], and [[Hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]] are serious problems for the Inuit people. Even more troubling, studies have shown that these issues are worse for women than other groups.&lt;ref name="Jorgensen"/&gt;

Another major issue facing the Inuit is that, after modernization, [[suicide]], [[Domestic violence|violence]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and substance abuse have become increasingly prevalent. This may be the result of psychological issues stemming from not having a place in society or being torn between modern life and the culture of their ancestors. Sadly, suicide, depression, and substance abuse are increasingly becoming associated with Inuit women.

The pressure for Inuit women to conform to the dress and behavior of modern [[Western culture]] is immense; however, many aspects of modern culture are foreign to the Inuit women and are directly at odds with the traditional practices of their culture. Contemporary Inuit women are trapped between cultures, and the results are devastating to their physical and psychological health.&lt;ref name="Billson" /&gt;

'''Jack Hoffman''' (born September 26, 2005) from [[Atkinson, Nebraska]], has [[Pediatrics|pediatric]] [[Brain tumor|brain cancer]]. In 2012, between his first and second brain surgeries, he was introduced to [[Rex Burkhead]], then a [[American football|football]] player for the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football]] team.  Subsequently, a close connection developed between Hoffman and the team.  On April 6, 2013, at the annual Nebraska spring game, Hoffman at age 7 entered the game during the fourth quarter and ran for a {{convert|69|yd|m}} touchdown that received national and international attention.  He subsequently met with President [[Barack Obama]], received a [[Best Moment ESPY Award]] for 2013, and the [[United States Senate]] approved a motion recognizing his role in raising awareness of pediatric brain cancer. The Team Jack Foundation was formed by his parents, Andy and Bri Hoffman, to raise money for pediatric brain research.

==Background==
Hoffman was born and is growing up in Atkinson, Nebraska.&lt;ref name =Litman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; His parents are Andy and Bri Hoffman and he has two sisters, Ava and Reese.&lt;ref name =Litman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP1/&gt;

On April 22, 2011 Hoffman was having breakfast with his parents when he became unresponsive.  He was rushed to the local hospital in Atkinson, Nebraska, where he had a [[Tonic–clonic seizure|grand mal seizure]] lasting 30 minutes.&lt;ref name =Litman&gt;
{{cite news|last=Litman|first=Laken|title=Little Jack Hoffman an inspiration to Nebraska football|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2013/04/08/jack-hoffman-cancer-patient-nebraska-spring-game/2065451/|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=8 April 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PcXaPnsE?url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2013/04/08/jack-hoffman-cancer-patient-nebraska-spring-game/2065451/|archivedate=May 16, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was then flown to [[Children's Hospital &amp; Medical Center]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], due to the life-threatening seizure.&lt;ref name =Litman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;
{{cite news|last=Ward|first=Andrew|title=Jack Hoffman, pediatric cancer patient, shares bond with NU running back Rex Burkhead|url=http://www.dailynebraskan.com/news/article_1b1db500-214e-11e2-b12b-001a4bcf6878.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=[[Daily Nebraskan]]|date=29 October 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PcjsDFoW?url=http://www.dailynebraskan.com/news/article_1b1db500-214e-11e2-b12b-001a4bcf6878.html|archivedate=16 May 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
He was subsequently diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]].  While at the hospital, Hoffman continued to have up to 10 to 12 seizures per day even though he was taking [[anticonvulsant]] medication.  On May 20, 2011 he had surgery, but the [[neurosurgeon]] could only remove a small portion of the tumor.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;  Subsequent pathology showed that it was a cancerous [[glioma]], [[Pediatrics|pediatric]] [[Brain tumor|brain cancer]].  Hoffman's parents then consulted [[Boston Children's Hospital]] for a second opinion. Neurosurgeon Liliana Goumnerova told the Hoffmans that she could remove the golf-ball sized tumor.&lt;ref name =Litman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt;

On October 10, 2011, Hoffman had a second surgery.  Over 90% of the tumor was removed and the seizures stopped.&lt;ref name =Litman/&gt;&lt;ref name =York&gt;

Surgery was followed by another 60 weeks of chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuruvilla&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuruvilla|first=Carol|title=Young cancer patient who scored touchdown for Nebraska Huskers is beating the disease|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/8-year-old-brain-cancer-patient-scored-touchdown-nebraska-huskers-beating-disease-article-1.1480957|accessdate=17 May 2014|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=9 October 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PcpICQzt?url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/8-year-old-brain-cancer-patient-scored-touchdown-nebraska-huskers-beating-disease-article-1.1480957|archivedate=17 May 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox and Friends"&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Fox and Friends]]|title=After Memorable TD Run, 8-Year-Old Jack Hoffman Is Beating Cancer|url=http://foxnewsinsider.com/2013/10/17/interview-8-year-old-jack-hoffman-beating-brain-cancer-after-nebraska-touchdown-run|accessdate=17 May 2014|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|date=17 October 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PcprDPKG?url=http://foxnewsinsider.com/2013/10/17/interview-8-year-old-jack-hoffman-beating-brain-cancer-after-nebraska-touchdown-run|archivedate=17 May 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2013, Hoffman's father reported that an MRI revealed that the remaining tumor was the same as in an MRI done in June, 2013, indicating that the cancerous tumor was not growing.&lt;ref name=Lampe&gt;

==Touchdown run==
During the time between Hoffman's first and second surgeries, his father called Keith Zimmer who was the associate director of [[Life Skills]] at the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]] [[Nebraska Cornhuskers|Athletic Department]].&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt; He wanted to get a picture of his son with his favorite Nebraska [[American football|football]] player, [[Rex Burkhead]].&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt; Burkhead agreed and met the family in September 2011. He had lunch with the Hoffman family, showed them [[Memorial Stadium, Lincoln|Memorial Stadium]], and decided he wanted to keep in touch with Hoffman.&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt; On Friday, October 7, 2011, Burkead called Hoffman before his second surgery to wish him well.&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt;  The next day Nebraska played [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] in a game nationally televised by [[ESPN College Football|ABC]], and ABC announcers mentioned Hoffman's story.&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt;&lt;ref name =York/&gt;  At halftime of the game, Nebraska trailed Ohio State 20-6.&lt;ref name =Litman/&gt; At that time Burkhead thought about Hoffman and he said to his teammates "Jack's not giving up and we're not giving up." Nebraska ended up winning the game, 34-27, which was the largest comeback in Nebraska football history.&lt;ref name =Litman/&gt;

In September 2012, Hoffman walked with the Nebraska players on to the field for their game against [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; In April 2013, as the spring football game neared, Jeff Jamrog (Assistant Athletic Director for Football) had the idea of getting Hoffman into the spring game.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;  He ran the idea by football coach [[Bo Pelini]] the night before the game and Pelini approved.&lt;ref name="Fox and Friends"/&gt;  Jamrog told the Hoffmans about their plan to get Jack into the game that night and the Hoffmans quickly made a uniform for him to wear the next day.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox and Friends"/&gt;

During the game, the Hoffmans were on the sidelines with the team.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; As the fourth quarter began, the Red team had fourth down and one yard to go on their own 32 yard line.  Pelini called timeout and sent Hoffman into the game wearing number 22 (Rex Burkhead's number).

==Team Jack==
After Rex Burkhead met Hoffman, a bond began to grow between him and the Nebraska football team.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; The players decided to start an initiative to raise money for cancer research they called "Team Jack."&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; Team Jack sold 30,000 T-shirts and collected $275,000 in donations, which they gave to the [[Dana Farber Cancer Institute]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. The Hoffman family subsequently established the Team Jack Foundation,&lt;ref name=Dunker/&gt; which has raised almost $1.5 million for pediatric brain cancer research.&lt;ref name=Healey/&gt;

==Life==
Born 27 December 1938 into a [[Basque people|Basque]] family in Barcelona, Sobrino entered the [[Society of Jesus]] when he was 18. The following year, in 1958, he was sent to [[El Salvador]]. He later studied engineering at [[Saint Louis University]], an American Jesuit university, and then theology at [[Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology]] in [[Frankfurt]] in [[West Germany]] for his Doctor of Theology (Dr.theol.) degree. Returning to [[El Salvador]], he taught at the Jesuit-run [[Universidad Centroamericana "José Simeón Cañas"|University of Central America (UCA)]] in [[San Salvador]], which he helped to found.

On 16 November 1989 he narrowly escaped the [[Murder of UCA scholars|murder of the UCA scholars]] by the Atlacatl Battalion, an elite unit of the Salvadoran Army. By a coincidence, he was away from El Salvador when members of the military broke into the rectory at the UCA and brutally murdered his six fellow Jesuits, [[Ignacio Ellacuría]], [[Segundo Montes]], Juan Ramón Moreno, [[Ignacio Martín-Baró]], Amando López, and Joaquín López y López, and their housekeeper Elba Ramos and her 16-year-old daughter Celina Ramos. The Jesuits were targeted for their outspoken work to bring a resolution to the brutal [[El Salvador Civil War]] that left about 75,000 men, women, and children dead, mostly civilians.

Investigated by the Vatican throughout his career as a professor of theology, he has remained an outspoken proponent of peace, joining protests in 2008 of the continued training of Latin American military officers in torture techniques at the [[School of the Americas]] at [[Fort Benning]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | author = John Dear | url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/road-peace/jon-sobrino-soa-protest | title =With Jon Sobrino at the SOA Protest | work =NCROnline | accessdate =25 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

Sobrino's main works are ''Jesus the Liberator'' (1991) and its sequel ''Christ the Liberator'' (1999), along with ''[[Christology]] at the Crossroads'' (1978), ''The True Church and the Poor'' (1984), ''Spirituality of Liberation'' (1990), ''The Principle of Mercy: Taking the Crucified People from the Cross'' (Orbis, 1994), ''No Salvation Outside the Poor'', and ''Prophetic-Utopian Essays'' (Orbis, 2008).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Vatican notification==

Because of the theological positions he took in his works, Sobrino was the subject of a theological [[notification (Holy See)|notification]]; a critique statement and an admonishment by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] in March 2007.

The congregation declared that Sobrino placed too great an emphasis on the human nature of [[Jesus Christ]], downplaying Jesus' divine nature, and that his "works contain propositions which are either erroneous or dangerous and may cause harm to the faithful."

While certain of his teachings were declared false, the congregation did not condemn or censure him, or prohibit him from teaching or lecturing. However, [[Federico Lombardi]] at the [[Vatican Press Office]] hinted at the possibility that his bishop or superior in the Jesuit order might choose to take action.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20070318010724/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0701439.htm Vatican Criticizes Jesuit Liberation Theologian, Issues No Sanctions] Catholic News Service, 15 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The congregation emphasized in the notification that it was issued as part of its service "to the people of God, and particularly to the simple and poorest members of the Church." They emphasized the people's "right to know the truth&amp;nbsp;... about Christ" and therefore their corresponding duty to intervene. The notification was premised on Benedict XVI's teaching that "the first poverty among people is not to know Christ."

According to the Notification, Sobrino's erroneous propositions concerned: "1) the methodological presuppositions on which the Author bases his theological reflection, 2) the Divinity of Jesus Christ, 3) the Incarnation of the Son of God, 4) the relationship between Jesus Christ and the Kingdom of God, 5) the Self-consciousness of Jesus, and 6) the salvific value of his Death."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

At the root of what the Vatican saw as Sobrino's error is his affirmation that "the '[[Church of the poor]]' is the ecclesial 'setting' of Christology and offers it its fundamental orientation." However, the Vatican believes that it is "only the [[apostolic faith]] which the Church has transmitted through all generations that constitutes the ecclesial setting of Christology and of theology in general."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Contrary to criticisms that the Vatican acted without due consultation and unfairly, the Vatican says that a Notification is made after notifying the author of the statements that are seen to be problematic and after awaiting a reply from the author who is given 3 months whereby to respond.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194442/http://212.77.1.245/news_services/bulletin/news/19857.php?index=19857&amp;lang=po#TRADUZIONE%20IN%20LINGUA%20%20INGLESE Holy See - Vatican City State]&lt;/ref&gt;

Retired professor of theology Peter Hünermann (then Tübingen, Germany)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fsspx.news/en/news-events/news/liberation-theologian-barred-teaching-and-publishing-21575|title=Liberation Theologian Barred from Teaching and Publishings|website=fsspx.news|language=en|access-date=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; declared in April 2007 that the Vatican notification was a "shock" for all theologians, because along with Sobrino "the most distinguished exegetes and systematic theologians&amp;nbsp;– both Catholic and Protestant&amp;nbsp;– stood in the dock".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Hünermann |url=http://www.khg-oldenburg.de/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=32&amp;Itemid=42 |title=Moderne Qualitätssicherung? Der Fall Jon Sobrino ist eine Anfrage an die Arbeit der Glaubenskongregation |journal=Herder-Korrespondenz |volume=61 |date=2007 |issue=4 |pages=184-188 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supported by more than 100 professors of Catholic theology, Hünermann also demanded an "intelligent redevelopment" of the Vatican Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, because, as successor organization of the Holy Office, it still had the structure of an "early modern board of censors".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cathnews.com/cathnews/12982-theologians-back-call-for-cdf-quotrestructuring-quot|title=Theologians Back Call for CDF "Restructuring"|website=cathnews.com|language=en-gb|access-date=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobrino's work was reviewed by a number of theologians, including {{ill|Bernard Sesboüé|fr}}, {{ill|José Ignacio González Faus|es}}, [[Javier Vitoria]], Carlo Palacio of [[Bello Horizonte]], and Martin Maier, editor of the German Jesuit periodical ''[[Stimmen der Zeit]]''. These theologians found no doctrinal errors in Sobrino's works. It is not apparent that their findings have been considered by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.&lt;ref name="Pope 2015 p. 237"&gt;{{cite book | last=Pope | first=Stephen J. | title=Hope and Solidarity: Jon Sobrino's Challenge to Christian Theology | publisher=Orbis Books | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-60833-276-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0CnOBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT237 | page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Allen |first=John L., Jr. |title=Vatican Censures Sobrino, Who Calls Procedures 'Not Honest' | work=National Catholic Reporter | date=14 March 2007 | url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican-censures-sobrino-who-calls-procedures-not-honest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julia Domna''' (AD 160–217) was a Roman empress of [[Roman Syria|Syrian]] origins, the second wife of [[Septimius Severus]] (reigned 193–211). She was born in [[Emesa]] in the Roman province of Syria, into a family of priests of the deity [[Elagabalus (deity)|Elagabalus]]. 

As a powerful political figure and member of the imperial family, Julia received titles such as "mother of the army camps". She was famous for her political influence. 

After Severus' death in 211, his two sons with Julia, [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] and [[Caracalla]], ruled jointly over Rome. Caracalla had Geta assassinated later that year. Julia continued to have a powerful role during the reign of Caracalla. Julia is thought to have committed suicide in 217 upon hearing of the assassination of Caracalla. After her death, her older sister [[Julia Maesa]] successfully contended for political power.

== Family background ==
Julia Domna was born in [[Emesa]] (modern day [[Homs]]) in Syria around 160 AD&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Jasper (2006). [https://books.google.com/books/about/Great_Women_of_Imperial_Rome.html?id=EWy3AwAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description ''Great Women of Imperial Rome: Mothers and Wives of the Caesars'']. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-1-134-13184-6}}: "The date of Julia's birth is not known, but coins of her sister Julia Maesa, minted about 220, show a woman nearing 60 (see figures 11.2, 11.17). Thus Julia Domna was probably born around 160."&lt;/ref&gt; to a family of Arab descent.&lt;ref&gt;

She was the youngest daughter of the high-priest of Ba'al [[Julius Bassianus|Gaius Julius Bassianus]] and sister to [[Julia Maesa]]. Through her sister and Maesa's husband [[Julius Avitus]], Julia Domna had two nieces: [[Julia Soaemias]] and [[Julia Mamaea]], the respective mothers of future Roman emperors [[Elagabalus]] and [[Severus Alexander]].&lt;ref name="Levick2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Levick, Barbara|title=Julia Domna: Syrian Empress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjkfKsCttrkC&amp;pg=PA18|date=10 May 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-32351-7|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julia's ancestors were [[Royal family of Emesa|priest kings]] of the famous temple of [[Elagabalus (deity)|Elagabalus]]. The family had enormous wealth and was promoted to Roman senatorial aristocracy. Before her marriage, Julia inherited the estate of her paternal great-uncle [[Julius Agrippa]], a former leading [[centurion]].&lt;ref name="Levick2007"/&gt;

=== Marriage ===
In the late 180s, Julia married the Libyan Roman general [[Septimius Severus]]. The marriage proved happy, and Severus cherished Julia and her political opinions, since she was very well-read and a student of philosophy. They had two sons, Caracalla ([[Caracalla|Lucius Septimius Bassianus]]) in 188 and Geta ([[Publius Septimius Geta]]) in 189.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, Anthony (1999). ''Septimius Severus: The African Emperor'', Routledge, p. 76-77. {{ISBN|0-203-02859-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil war==
{{Main article|Year of the Five Emperors}}
After the Roman emperor [[Commodus]] was murdered without an heir in 192, many contenders rushed for the throne, including Julia's husband, Septimius Severus. An elder senator, [[Pertinax]], was appointed by the praetorian guard as the new emperor of Rome. But when Pertinax would not meet the guard's demands, he too was murdered.&lt;ref name="Rahman"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://thecorner.wordpress.com/2006/06/05/the-african-emperor-the-life-career-and-rise-to-power-of-septimius-severus/ | title=The African Emperor? The Life, Career, and Rise to Power of Septimius Severus, MA thesis | publisher=[[University of Wales Lampeter]] | author=Rahman, Abdur | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another politician, [[Didius Julianus]], was called to Rome and appointed emperor. Severus, coming from the north into Rome, overthrew Julianus and had him executed. Severus claimed the title of emperor in 193. By offering [[Clodius Albinus]], a powerful governor of [[Britannia]], the rank of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] (successor), Severus could focus on his other rival to the throne, [[Pescennius Niger]], whom he defeated at the [[Battle of Issus (194)|Battle of Issus]] in 194.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, Anthony (1999). ''Septimius Severus: The African Emperor'', Routledge, p. 89-128. {{ISBN|0-203-02859-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When afterwards Severus declared openly his son Caracalla as successor, Clodius Albinus was hailed emperor by his troops. At the [[Battle of Lugdunum]] in 197, Severus defeated and killed Albinus, establishing himself as Emperor. Thus Julia Domna became Empress consort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36750306|title=Roman Britain and the English settlements|last=1889–1943.|first=Collingwood, R. G.

=== Power and influence ===
Unlike most imperial wives, Julia remarkably accompanied her husband on his military campaigns and stayed in camp with the army.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Julia Domna 170 CE Syria |url=http://www.women-philosophers.com/Julia-Domna.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120530033857/http://www.women-philosophers.com/Julia-Domna.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 May 2012 |website=Women-philosophers |accessdate=6 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, honorary titles were granted to Julia similar to those given to [[Faustina the Younger]], including ''mater castorum'', mother of the camp,&lt;ref name="levick"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Julia Domna: Syrian Empress|last=Levick|first=Barbara|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=9781134323517|location=|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''mater Augustus'', mother of Augustus, and ''mater patriae, mother of the fatherland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernario|first=H. W.|year=1958|title=Julia Domna: Mater Senatus et Patriae|url=|journal=Phoenix|volume=12|pages=67–70|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The empress was involved in building projects, most notably the ''[[Temple of Vesta|aedes Vestae]]'' after the fire of Commodus in 192 destroyed areas of the temple and the home, or Atrium, of the Vestal Virgins; based on numismatic evidence, historical authors, and a laconic inscription found ''in situ'', some scholars agree that Julia funded restorations to the site during Septimius Severus's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Portraits of the Vestal Virgins: Priestesses of Ancient Rome|last=Lindner|first=M. M.|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=Ann Arbor, MI|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julia was respected and viewed positively for most of her tenure, as indicators and evidence include the coins minted with her portrait, mentioning her with several honorary titles and also simply as "Julia Augusta". Julia is said to have exceeded all other Roman empresses in titles and honours.&lt;ref name=levick /&gt; The hairstyle that she used would later be worn by Roman empress [[Cornelia Salonina]] and [[Palmyra]]n queen [[Zenobia]].&lt;ref name="Southern2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Southern, Pat|title=Empress Zenobia: Palmyra's Rebel Queen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqMrR29Cc7MC|date=2 August 2018|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-441-17351-5|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transition of power ==
When Severus died in 211 in [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]), Julia became the mediator between their two sons, Caracalla and Geta, who were supposed to rule as joint emperors, according to their father's wishes expressed in his will. The two young men were never fond of each other and quarrelled frequently. Geta was murdered by Caracalla's soldiers in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Rome Fell: death of a superpower|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|publisher=New Haven: Yale University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-300-16426-8|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geta's name was then removed from inscriptions and [[Damnatio memoriae|his image was erased]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Rome|last=Dunstan|first=William E.|publisher=Lanham: Rowman and Littlefield|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7425-6832-7|pages=405–406}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Rome Fell: death of a superpower|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|publisher=New Haven: Yale University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-300-16426-8|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
During his campaign against the [[Parthian empire]] in 217, Caracalla was assassinated by a soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Rome Fell: death of a superpower|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|publisher=New Haven: Yale University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-300-16426-8|location=|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julia chose to commit suicide after hearing about the rebellion,&lt;ref name="CJones" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birley, Anthony (1999).

Caesaris'' (perhaps a separate chamber in the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]]). Later, however, both her bones and those of Geta were transferred by Julia Maesa to the [[Mausoleum of Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cassius Dio — Epitome of Book 79 |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-24.4 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526042142/http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-26 |website=University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Julia Domna is remembered for encouraging [[Philostratus]] to write ''[[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]''.&lt;ref name="Dzielska"&gt;{{cite book| title = Apollonius of Tyana in Legend and History| edition = | last1 = Dzielska| first1 = Maria |author1-link=Maria Dzielska| last2 = Stucchi | first2 = Sandro| year = 1986| publisher = | isbn = 88-7062-599-0| pages = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julia is thought to have died before Philostratus could finish his work of eight volumes.&lt;ref name="CJones"&gt;{{cite book| title = Philostratus, The Life of Apollonius of Tyana| edition = | last = Jones| first = Christopher P. | year = 2005| publisher = Harvard University Press| id = | pages = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kathryn Kuhlman''' (May 9, 1907 – February 20, 1976) was an American [[Pentecostal]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] known for hosting healing services.

==Personal life==
Kathryn Johanna Kuhlman was born in [[Concordia, Missouri]], to [[Ethnic German|German]]-American parents. After a spiritual experience at age 13, several years later, she began itinerant preaching, with her elder sister and brother-in law, in [[Idaho]]. Later, she was ordained by the [[Evangelical Church Alliance]].&lt;ref name=obitNY&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/02/22/archives/kathryn-kuhlman-evangelist-and-faith-healer-dies-in-tulsa.html | title=Kathryn Kuhlman, Evangelist And Faith Healer, Dies in Tulsa | publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=February 22, 1976 | first= Gary| last=  Settle| accessdate =2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuhlman met Burroughs Waltrip, a Texas evangelist who was eight years her senior. Shortly after his visit to Denver, Waltrip divorced his wife, left his family and moved to [[Mason City, Iowa]], where he began a revival center called Radio Chapel. Kuhlman and her friend and pianist Helen Gulliford came into town to help him raise funds for his ministry. It was shortly after their arrival that the romance between Burroughs and Kuhlman became publicly known.

Burroughs and Kuhlman decided to wed. While discussing the matter with some friends, Kuhlman had said that she could not "find the will of God in the matter." These and other friends encouraged her not to go through with the marriage, but Kuhlman justified it to herself and others by believing that Waltrip's wife had left him, not the other way around. On October 18, 1938, she secretly married "Mister," as she liked to call Waltrip, in Mason City. The wedding did not give her new peace about their union, however. The couple had no children. Regarding her marriage, in a 1952 interview with the Denver Post, Kuhlman said, "He charged—correctly—that I refused to live with him. And I haven't seen him in eight years."&lt;ref&gt;Buckingham, J. (1976) Daughter of destiny: Kathryn Kuhlman...Her story. Plainfield, New Jersey: Logos International, p. 82 {{ISBN|0-88270-784-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was divorced by Burroughs Waltrip in 1948.

==Ministry==
Kuhlman traveled extensively around the United States and in many other countries holding "healing crusades" between the 1940s and 1970s. She was one of the most well-known healing ministers in the world.&lt;ref name="obitNY" /&gt; Kuhlman had a weekly [[TV program]] in the 1960s and 1970s called ''I Believe In Miracles'' that was aired nationally. She also had a 30-minute nationwide radio ministry of teaching from the Bible and frequently would feature excerpts from her healing services (both music and message). Her foundation was established in 1954, and its [[Canada|Canadian]] branch in 1970. Late in her life she was supportive of the nascent [[Jesus movement]], and received endorsements by its key leaders, including David Wilkerson and Chuck Smith.  

By 1970 she moved to Los Angeles, conducting healing services for thousands of people each day as an heir to [[Aimee Semple McPherson]].&lt;ref name="Kuhlman1970"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0021/6793856/47241589_clean.html|title=Aimee Macpherson has a Dazzling Successor|last=|first=|date=July 4, 1970|work=|accessdate=2007-11-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=yes|publisher=[[Pasadena Star-News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became well known for her "gift of healing" despite, as she often noted, having no theological training.&lt;ref name="Kuhlman1970"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=March 2018}}  She was friends with Christian television pioneer Pat Robertson and made guest appearances at his Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) and on the network's flagship program "The 700 Club."

In 1975, Kuhlman was sued by Paul Bartholomew, her personal administrator, who claimed that she kept $1 million in jewelry and $1 million in fine art hidden away and sued her for $430,500 for breach of contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/120169428.html?dids=120169428:120169428&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=JUL+18%2C+1975&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Evangelist+Sued+By+a+Former+Aide&amp;pqatl=google | title=Evangelist Sued By a Former Aide | publisher=[[Washington Post]] |date=July 18, 1975 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/662183362.html?dids=662183362:662183362&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Jul+03%2C+1975&amp;author=RUSSELL+CHANDLER&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Ex-Aides+Sue+Kathryn+Kuhlman&amp;pqatl=google |title=Ex-Aides Sue Kathryn Kuhlman | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 3, 1975 | first= Russell| last=  Chandler| accessdate =2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two former associates accused her in the lawsuit of diverting funds and of illegally removing records, which she denied and said the records were not private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wOgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=onkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5546,2534488&amp;dq=kathryn+kuhlman | title=Kathryn Kuhlman Sued By Former Associates | publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=July 12, 1975 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-11-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kuhlman, the lawsuit was settled prior to trial.&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh1975"/&gt;

==Healing==
Many accounts of medically documented healings were published in her books, which were [[ghostwriter|ghost-written]] by author Jamie Buckingham of Florida, including her autobiography, which was dictated at a hotel in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;Buckingham, J. (1976) Daughter of destiny: Kathryn Kuhlman...Her story. Plainfield, New Jersey: Logos International, p 167 {{ISBN|0-88270-784-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckingham also wrote his own Kuhlman  biography that presented an unvarnished account of her life.&lt;ref&gt;Buckingham, J. (1976) Daughter of destiny: Kathryn Kuhlman...Her story. Plainfield, New Jersey: Logos International {{ISBN|0-88270-784-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated two million people reported they were healed in her meetings over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/religion/famed-preacher-kathryn-kuhlman-died-here-years-ago/article_a09b9f6a-7b37-5184-91cb-9e85c36e5deb.html|title=Famed preacher Kathryn Kuhlman died here 40 years ago|last=SHERMAN|first=BILL|date=Feb 20, 2016|work=Tulsa World|access-date=2018-03-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- who made this statistic?

Following a 1967 fellowship in Philadelphia, Dr. [[William A. Nolen]] conducted a case study of 23 people who said they had been cured during one of her services.&lt;ref name="NoHealing"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0030/5967824/21003862_clean.html | title=Psychic Healing?

One woman who was said to have been cured of spinal cancer threw away her brace and ran across the stage at Kuhlman's command; her spine collapsed the next day and she died four months later.&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh1975"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cOQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iG0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5291,834959&amp;dq=kathryn+kuhlman+william+nolen|title=Inside Religion: Kuhlman Tested By MD's Probe|last=Lester|first=Kinsolving|date=November 8, 1975|work=|accessdate=2007-11-12|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4vMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TnkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5343,1149932&amp;dq=kathryn+kuhlman | title=A follow-up study of 23 patients 'cured' in a Kathryn Kuhlman service | publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=November 2, 1974 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-11-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhlman"&gt;{{cite book| last = Randi | first = James | authorlink = James Randi | year = 1989 | title = [[The Faith Healers]] | publisher = Prometheus Books | id =  228| isbn = 0-87975-535-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nolen's analysis of Kulhman came in for criticism from believers. Lawrence Althouse, a physician, said that Nolen had attended only one of  Kuhlman's services and did not follow up with all of those who said they had been healed there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rediscovering the Gift of Healing.  Nashville: Abingdon,|last = Althaus|first = Lawrence|publisher = |year = 1977|isbn = |location = |pages = 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Richard Casdorph produced a book of evidence in support of miraculous healings by Kuhlman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Miracles: A Medical Doctor  Says Yes to Miracles!|last = Casdorph|first = Richard|publisher = |year = 1976|isbn = |location = |pages = 169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hendrik van der Breggen, a Christian philosophy professor, argued in favor of the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Miracle Reports, Moral Philosophy, and Contemporary Science.|last = Hendrik van der|first = Breggen|publisher = |year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = 382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Craig Keener concluded, "No one claims that everyone was healed, but it is also difficult to dispute that significant recoveries occurred, apparently in conjunction with prayer. One may associate these with Kathryn Kuhlman's faith or that of the supplicants, or, as in some of Kuhlman's teaching, to no one's faith at all; but the evidence suggests that some people were  healed, even in extraordinary ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Miracles: The Credibility of the New Testament Accounts|last = Keener|first = Craig|publisher = |year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = 614 (ebook format)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Richard Owellen, a member of the cancer‐research department of the Johns Hopkins Hospital who appeared frequently at Miss Kuhlman's services, testified to various healings that he said he had investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Kuhlman, Evangelist And Faith Healer, Dies in Tulsa,

==Death==

In 1955, in her late 40s, Kuhlman was diagnosed with a heart problem. She kept a very busy schedule, often traveling across the United States and around the world, holding two- to six-hour long meetings which ended late. In July 1975 her doctor diagnosed her with a minor heart flare-up; in November she had a relapse.&lt;ref name="ObitPittsburgh"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0034/6776963/33852475_clean.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104021820/http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0034/6776963/33852475_clean.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=January 4, 2013 | title=Kathryn Kuhlman Is Dead  | publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=February 21, 1976 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Kuhlman had open-heart surgery in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] from which she died on February 20, 1976. &lt;ref name="obitNY" /&gt; Kathryn Kuhlman is interred in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]]. A plaque in her honor is in the main city park in Concordia, Missouri, a town in central Missouri on Interstate Highway 70.

After she died, her [[Will (law)|will]] led to controversy.&lt;ref name="Bequests1976"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0023/6792967/46427475_clean.html | title=Kuhlman Bequests Listed | publisher=[[Independent Press-Telegram]] |date=April 17, 1976
 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She left $267,500, the bulk of her estate, to three family members and twenty employees. Smaller bequests were given to 19 other employees.&lt;ref name="Bequests1976" /&gt;{{Dead link|date=March 2018}} According to the ''[[Independent Press-Telegram]]'', her employees were disappointed that "she did not leave most of her estate to the foundation as she had done under a previous 1974 will."&lt;ref name="Bequests1976" /&gt; The Kathryn Kuhlman Foundation had continued, but due to lack of funding, in 1982 terminated its nationwide radio broadcasting.  Ultimately, the Foundation shut its doors in April 2016. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.charismanews.com/us/55287-kathryn-kuhlman-s-foundation-shutters-doors-40-years-after-her-death&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
For several decades there has been serious debate regarding the authenticity of Kuhlman's ministry. Some{{according to whom|date=September 2015}} would suggest that she was a modern-day [[prophet]] exercising the power of God.
The debate continues today with many believers upholding Kuhlman as an important forerunner (including proponents of the "[[Prosperity Theology]]" and "[[Faith Healing]]" movement, such as [[Benny Hinn]]), and with some Christian [[Cessationism|cessationist]] apologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Counterfeit_Revival.html?id=mqxGNgAACAAJ|title=Counterfeit Revival|last=Hanegraaff|first=Hank|date=1997|publisher=Word Pub.|isbn=9780849938924|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;Others argue the opposite:  that is, that Kuhlman did not teach core tenents of "word of faith" and "hyper-prosperity" doctrine; for example she did not teach "little gods" doctrine, nor that Jesus suffered the pains of hell and thus needed to be born-again in hell.  Significantly, neither did she teach that faith (on the part of the sick person) is always a prerequisite to supernatural healing, as is taught in classic "word of faith" doctrine.

Still, she influenced [[faith healers]] [[Benny Hinn]] and [[Billy Burke (evangelist)|Billy Burke]]. Hinn has adopted some of her techniques and wrote a book about her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/2002-05/i-files.html |title=Benny Hinn: Healer or Hypnotist? |publisher=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=May–June 2002 |first=Joe |last=Nickell |accessdate=2007-11-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012200735/http://www.csicop.org/si/2002-05/i-files.html |archivedate=2007-10-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 [[David Byrne]] and [[Brian Eno]] sampled one of Kuhlman's sermons in their album ''[[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|My Life in the Bush of Ghosts]]''.  The track was entitled "The Spirit Womb," a mis-hearing of Kuhlman's actual utterance "the spirit world."  When Kuhlman's estate refused to license the use of her voice, the track was re-recorded as "[[The Jezebel Spirit]]" with an unidentified exorcist's vocal replacing Kuhlman's.&lt;ref name="Duke UP - 14 March 2011 - McLeod and DiCola - Creative License: The Law and Culture of Digital Sampling"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nOWdriHLHgQC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=%22The+Jezebel+Spirit%22+Byrne#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Jezebel%20Spirit%22%20Byrne&amp;f=false|title=Creative License: The Law and Culture of Digital Sampling|last=[[Kembrew McLeod]] and Peter DiCola|first=|date=14 March 2011|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=|isbn=9780822348757|location=|pages=167|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions about her were raised in the Crusaders Series of Christian Comics dealing with True Doctrine in the Church, which are published by [[Jack Chick]].

She appeared on ''The Tonight Show'' with Johnny Carson in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title="The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" Episode #13.196 (TV Episode 1974)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6473540/fullcredits|accessdate=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, she was mentioned on more than one occasion on the ''[[Mary Tyler Moore ]]'' Show, as well as ''The Carol Burnett Show''.

[[Ruth Buzzi]] did a character based on Kuhlman on ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh In]]''.

'''Mark James Robert Essex''' (August 12, 1949&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Leonard Nathaniel: [https://books.google.com/books?id=V7IluPG0GJ8C&amp;pg=PA96 Black rage in New Orleans - Police brutality and African American activism from World War II to Hurricane Katrina], [[Louisiana State University Press]] (Baton Rouge), 2010; {{ISBN|9780807135907}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; January 7, 1973) was an [[United States|American]] who killed nine people, including five policemen, and wounded 13 others in [[New Orleans]] on January 1, 1973, and January 7, 1973.

==Background==
Mark James Robert Essex was born in [[Emporia, Kansas]]. After graduating from Emporia Senior High School in 1967, Essex attended [[Emporia State University]], where he dropped out after only one semester. He joined the [[United States Navy]] as a dental technician in 1969, stationed in [[San Diego, California]], where he claimed he was subjected to two years of ceaseless racial abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Cawthorne, Nigel &amp; Geoff Tibballs. ''Killers : contract killers, spree killers, sex killers, the ruthless exponents of murder, the most evil crime of all.'' [[London]]: [[Macmillan Publishers|Boxtree]], 1994, pp. 238-40; retrieved May 9, 2017; {{ISBN|0-7522-0850-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He went [[absent without leave]] (AWOL) from October 19 until November 16, 1970. He was given a general discharge for unsuitability on February 10, 1971, for "character and behavior disorders". After his discharge, he became involved with black radicals in [[San Francisco, California]], and later joined the New York [[Black Panthers]].&lt;ref name=snipe&gt;[http://www.nola.com/175years/index.ssf/2011/12/1973_mark_essex_the_howard_joh.html "The Times-Picayune in 175 years - 1973: Mark Essex, the Howard Johnson's sniper"], ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'', December 16, 2011; retrieved March 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shootings==
===New Year's Eve, 1972===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
At the age of 23 and living in New Orleans, Essex began targeting policemen. On New Year's Eve 1972, Essex parked his car and went down Perdido Street, a block from the [[New Orleans Police Department]]. He hid in a parking lot across from the busy central lockup and used a 5-shot [[Ruger]] Model 44 [[.44 Magnum|.44-caliber]] [[semi-automatic rifle|semi-automatic]] [[carbine]] to kill Cadet Alfred Harrell, 19. Lt. Horace Perez was also wounded in the attack. Harrell was black, although Essex had claimed he was going to kill "just [[honky|honkies]]"&lt;ref&gt;McConnaughey, Janet. [http://azdailysun.com/new-orleans-textbook-example-of-how-not-to-stop-a/article_0e2a6b3e-4079-5654-b7da-775f8df2c6fa.html "New Orleans 1973: Textbook example of how not to stop a serial sniper"], ''[[Arizona Daily Sun]]'', January 4, 2003; retrieved January 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; before beginning his murderous attacks. 

Essex evaded being taken into custody by jumping a chain link fence and running across [[Interstate 10 in Louisiana|I-10]], while setting off firecrackers as a diversion. Essex then ran into [[Gert Town]], an area renowned for high crime and hostility towards police. In Gert Town, Essex broke into the Burkart building, a warehouse and manufacturing plant on the corner of Euphrosine and South Gayoso. Upon entering the building, an alarm alerted police to a break-in at the business. A dog unit with Officers Edwin Hosli Sr. and Harold Blappert responded to the call, not realizing the connection of the break-in to the attack on central lockup.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

When Officer Hosli went to get his [[German shepherd]] out of the back seat of the car, Essex shot him in the back. Essex then started shooting the car, shattering the windshield. Officer Blappert then crawled across the front seat to the radio and called for back-up. Blappert fired four shots at the spot where he saw muzzle flashes from Essex's rifle, then he pulled his partner's body onto the front seat of the car and waited for back-up. When the back-up arrived, they sent two dogs into the building to search for Essex, but Essex had escaped again. Officer Hosli died of his injuries on March 5, 1973.{{cn|date=May 2017}}
[[File:HolidayInnNOLALoyolaAvJan2008.jpg|thumb|right|The New Orleans [[Holiday Inn]] Hotel as it appears today. In 1973, it was the New Orleans [[Howard Johnson's]] hotel, where Essex took part in a gun battle with police.]]

===January 7, 1973===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
At 10:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. on January 7, 1973, Essex shot grocer Joe Perniciaro with his .44 Magnum carbine and next [[carjacking|carjacked]] Marvin Albert as he sat in his 1968 [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] outside his house on South White Street. Essex drove Albert's stolen vehicle to the Downtown [[Howard Johnson's]] Hotel at 330 Loyola Avenue in New Orleans' Central Business District, across the street from City Hall and Orleans Parish Civil District Court. After almost hitting a startled motorist in the hotel's parking garage, Essex began to climb the stairs, only to find the fire doors locked on floor after floor.

Gaining entry from a fire stairwell on the 18th floor, the top floor of the building, Essex startled three Howard Johnson's employees, all of whom were African-American. Essex told them not to worry, as he was only there to kill white people. The employees promptly notified the authorities. In the hallway in front of room 1829, Essex found 27-year-old vacationing Dr. Robert Steagall and his wife Betty, a couple from [[Virginia]] enjoying a belated honeymoon. After a struggle with Dr. Steagall, Essex shot him in the chest and shot Betty in the back of the head. The Steagalls both died of their injuries. In the room, he soaked telephone books with lighter fluid and set them ablaze under the curtains. Essex dropped a [[Pan-African flag]] onto the floor beside the bodies of the couple as he left. On the 11th floor, Essex shot his way into several rooms and set more fires. On the 11th floor, he shot and killed Frank Schneider, the hotel's assistant manager, and shot Walter Collins, the hotel's general manager. Collins died in the hospital three weeks later as a result of his gunshot wounds.

The police and fire department quickly arrived. Two officers tried to use a fire truck's ladder to enter the building, but were shot at by Essex. A few minutes later, Essex shot and killed NOPD Officers Phillip Coleman and Paul Persigo from his perch on the 18th floor. ''Times-Picayune'' photographer G.E. Arnold took an iconic photo as Coleman died of a head wound in Duncan Plaza. Arnold also captured a shot of a wounded Eighth District NOPD officer, Ken Solis, shot in the shoulder and leaning against a tree as another officer, Dave McCann, was trying to stop the bleeding, all while other police and bystanders take cover. While trying to rescue trapped officers, Deputy Superintendent Louis Sirgo was fatally shot in the spine by Essex. Lt. Lewis Townsend, a Tulane medical student, walked into the open field to carry Sirgo out of the line of fire, then returned to class.

Seeing the story on TV, Lt. General Chuck Pitman of the [[United States Marine Corps]] offered the use of a [[CH-46]] military [[helicopter]] to assist the police officers. The helicopter was loaded with armed men and dispatched to the hotel. By this time, Essex had retreated up to the roof of the building where he and the helicopter exchanged many rounds over many hours. As nightfall came, Essex found cover in a concrete cubicle on the southeast side of the roof. As he stepped out once again in the open to fire again on the helicopter, and after hitting the helicopter's transmission, Essex was barraged with fatal gunfire from police sharpshooters on the roofs of adjacent buildings as well as the automatic weapons aboard the helicopter. An autopsy later revealed more than 200 gunshot wounds.

==Aftermath==
After the smoke had cleared, a tally revealed that Essex had shot 19 people, including 10 policemen. Essex is buried in Plot 47-4-1 (with a headstone) in Maplewood Memorial Lawn Cemetery, Emporia, Kansas.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Pereira-Kamath began his government service in the year 1970. Prior to this, he managed his father's Coffee Estates in Sakleshpur and was an Advocate in the Bangalore Courts from 1967 to 1970.

Known for his no-nonsense approach to curbing anti-social elements and rioters and for bringing order to chaotic conditions on city roads in Delhi, Pereira-Kamath belonged to the Union Territories (now AGMUT) Cadre of the Indian Police Service (I.P.S.) He has worked with the Delhi, Sikkim and Mizoram police in various capacities, specialising in criminology, administration, police community relations, traffic management/road safety, and the management of public offices, productivity and personnel. He has attended seminars and conferences in various parts of the world, visiting the countries of Japan, Singapore, the U.K., Canada, and the U.S.A.

==Controversies==

Maxwell Pereira was accused by the respected academic [[Madhu Kishwar]] of having described the street vendors as 'vermins' even though the [[Supreme Court of India]] had declared their profession lawful. Allegedly Ms.Kishwar had approached him while he was still a serving policeman to curb the extortion the vendors faced at the hands of [[Delhi Police]]. This accusation was witnessed by millions on the [[Headlines Today]] programme anchored by [[Rahul Kanwal]] . He denied using the epithet but went on to say that he did consider street vending illegal despite the Supreme Court ruling. Moreover, he refused to acknowledge any error on part of [[Delhi Police]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} It is an interesting observation that while street vending might be a lawful profession, operating without a sales permit and a health permit, is definitely unlawful. The Delhi High Court in its [http://m.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/evict-street-vendors-from-lajpat-nagar-central-market-orders-delhi-hc-citing-security/story-eD0RY3nwm8LzwRzIWNSOmK_amp.html judgement of July 2017] has ruled against street venders despite the plea of the association representing the squatters that street vending is the only source of livelihood for 800-900 families.

==Anti Sikh Riots 1984 in Delhi==
Maxwell Pereira is the only officer unequivocally commended by repeated Commissions of Enquiry for his role in controlling the riots and carnage against members of the Sikh community during Nov-1984 Riots following the assassination of the then Prime Minister of India Mrs Indira Gandhi. Shri Pereira was especially commended in the Kusum Lata Mittal Report&lt;ref&gt;* KUSUM LATA MITTAL REPORT - Witness84: www.witness84.com/doc/kusum_lata_mittal.doc&lt;/ref&gt; (on fixing specific responsibility on erring police officials) for the firm action taken by him against the advancing Mob determined to attack the Sheesh Ganj Gurdwara Sahib in Chandni Chowk and the Sikhs who had taken shelter within its precincts, by ordering the police under him to open fire, and on the spot rewarding the Head Constable Satish Chander for complying with the orders - thereby making a tremendous impact on the mob which instantly dispersed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraphindia.com/1091024/jsp/opinion/story_11635419.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

== The NamUs program ==
The National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) is a national clearinghouse and resource center for missing, unidentified, and unclaimed person cases throughout the United States.  Funded and administered by the National Institute of Justice through a cooperative agreement with the University of North Texas Health Science Center's Center for Human Identification, all NamUs resources are provided to law enforcement, medical examiners, coroners, allied forensic professionals, and family members of missing persons.

No-cost NamUs resources include technology, forensic and analytical services, investigative support, and local, regional, and online training programs. By bringing people, information, forensic science, and technology together, NamUs helps resolve missing and unidentified person cases across the country. Services include:

* Database technology which provides a secure, easy-to-use, centralized online database for information sharing, case management, advanced searching, and automatic matching tools to expedite case associations and resolutions.
* Regional Program Specialists (RPSs) who hold Department of Justice security clearances, vet all professional users and case data, assist with the collection of biometric information, provide NamUs training, assist with the coordination and implementation of missing person day events, and provide investigative support to missing, unidentified, and unclaimed person cases.
* Fingerprint services to scan, classify, upload, analyze, and compare fingerprint information submitted to NamUs, including collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for searching unidentified decedent prints through the FBI's Next Generation Identification national database.
* Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA analyses through the University of North Texas Center for Human Identification's Missing Persons Unit.
* Forensic Odontology services to obtain, code, and upload dental information to NamUs.  
* Forensic anthropology services through the University of North Texas' Center for Human Identification's Missing Persons Unit.
* Analytical services to assist with locating indication of life for persons reported missing to NamUs, locating family contact information for DNA collections and next of kin death notifications, and locating/vetting tips and leads related to missing and unidentified person cases.

==The number of missing persons and unidentified remains in the United States==
Over 600,000 individuals go missing in the United States every year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.namus.gov/|title=NamUs|website=www.namus.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many missing children and adults are quickly found, alive and well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, tens of thousands of individuals remain missing for more than one year – what many agencies consider “cold cases”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A 2004 Bureau of Justice Statistics study found that each year, 4,400 unidentified bodies are recovered in the United States, with approximately 1,000 of those bodies remaining unidentified after one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hickman|first=Matthew J.|date=June 2007|title=Medical Examiners and Coroners' Offices, 2004|url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/meco04.pdf|journal=Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report|volume=NCJ 216756|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 15, 2018, there were over 14,000 missing person cases and over 12,000 unidentified person cases published in NamUs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The number of missing and unidentified remains in the United States has been deemed our nation's silent "mass disaster over time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nij.gov/journals/256/pages/missing-persons.aspx|title=Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains: The Nation’s Silent Mass Disaster|website=National Institute of Justice|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of NamUs==
In 2003, the National Institute of Justice began funding major efforts to maximize the use of DNA technology in our criminal justice system, including in the investigation of missing and unidentified person cases. By 2005, the institute expanded its efforts with the “Identifying the Missing Summit”, where criminal justice practitioners, forensic scientists, policymakers, and victim advocates defined major challenges in investigating and solving missing and unidentified decedent cases. As a result of that summit, the Deputy Attorney General created the National Missing Persons Task Force, which identified the need to improve access to information that would help solve missing and unidentified person cases. The National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) was created to meet that need.

In 2007, the NamUs Unidentified Persons database was launched, providing medical examiners and coroners with a tool to store and share case information with criminal justice professionals and family members of missing persons across the country. The following year, the NamUs Missing Persons (MP) database was launched, and in 2009, the databases were connected for automatic case comparisons, expanding the power of NamUs to make associations between missing and unidentified persons.

In 2011, daily management of the NamUs program was transitioned to the University of North Texas Health Science Center, with continued administration and oversight by the National Institute of Justice. Management through the Center for Human Identification at the university enhanced NamUs' ability to facilitate DNA services and enhanced the quality and quantity of DNA information entered into NamUs.

In 2012, an Analytical Division was added to NamUs, offering criminal justice professionals additional resources to locate information on missing persons, locate family members for DNA sample collections and next of kin death notifications, and disposition tips and leads. Also in 2012, the NamUs AFIS/Fingerprint Unit was created, bringing additional in-house forensic services to NamUs, including a collaboration with the FBI's Latent Print Unit to search all unidentified decedent prints through the Next Generation Identification system.

In late 2015, plans to perform a complete rebuild of the NamUs application began. Stakeholders from the law enforcement, medical examiner, coroner, non-profit, and public sector were interviewed as part of a Discovery Phase to plan the features and functionality of the upgraded system. Development work began in the first quarter of 2016 and culminated in the release of the NamUs 2.0 application in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.namus.gov/About|title=About NamUs|website=www.namus.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''General Paul Malong Awan Anei''' (born early 1962 in Warawar), is a [[South Sudan]]ese politician and military figure. He has formerly served as governor of [[Northern Bahr el Ghazal]] from 27 March 2008 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?mot617 | title=Paul Malong Awan Anei| publisher=Sudan Tribune |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeradio.org/update-kiir-appoints-paul-malong-awan-spla-chief/|title=Update: Kiir appoints Paul Malong Awan SPLA chief|publisher=EyeRadio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Paul Malong was born in the early year of 1962 in Warawar, a village situated about forty-five kilometers north of Aweil town in the former Northern Bahr el Gazal State. He was born to Aluat (mother) and Awan Anei (father). His father was a chief who governed his kinsmen in the Wun-Anei section of Abiem, situated in current [[Aweil East]] State. At eight years old, his father was killed by a member of his community. The family is survived by four children. Malong’s older siblings are deceased. In the order of their birth (excluding the deceased), the children of Anei’s first wife, who is also Malong’s mother, are Agot, Amou, him and Atak.

As a young man, Malong attended schools in his village. After his father was killed in the late 1965s, Malong moved to [[Muglad]], where he completed primary school in 1969 in Sudan. He completed his intermediate education at St. James in Khartoum, where he participated in the clandestine formation of the [[Anyanya II]] movement in the Bahr el Gazal area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talkofjuba.com/opinion/general-paul-malong-awan/|title=Who is General Paul Malong Awan?|date=14 October 2016|publisher=Talk of Juba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malong has more than 100 wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The perils of polygamy: The link between polygamy and war|url=https://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21732695-plural-marriage-bred-inequality-begets-violence-link-between-polygamy-and-war|accessdate=22 December 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
When he left to join the SPLM/A, arriving in July 1984 in [[Ethiopia]], Malong, was transferred to the Steel (Hadit) Battalion of Koryom Division. He went to Officers’ Cadet and graduated with the rank of captain in July the same year. After his graduation he was transferred to Northern Upper Nile around the Maban area. He returned to Itang, which was then the second largest refugee camp in Ethiopia. After a few months of lull, he was recalled and commissioned to the rank of major in October 1985. He was then posted to Southern Blue Nile in the Eagle Battalion, where he spent three years at the battle front.

In April 2014 he was appointed Chief of General Staff of the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] by the president of [[South Sudan]], [[Salva Kiir Mayardit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article50788|title=South Sudan’s new army commander says constitutional defence top priority|date=26 April 2014|accessdate=24 July 2014|publisher=Sudan Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became army chief, replacing James Hoth Mai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27137000|title=South Sudan President Salva Kiir sacks army chief|date=24 April 2014|accessdate=24 July 2014|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, he was flown to Nairobi, Kenya for treatment in [[The Nairobi Hospital|Nairobi Hospital]] after he collapsed in Juba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Malong still "critically ill" at Nairobi Hospital: Eyewitness|url=https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/paul-malong-still-critically-ill-nairobi-hospital-eyewitness|publisher=Radio Tamazuj|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, President Kiir issued a presidential decree replacing him with General [[James Ajonga Mawut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/south-sudan-kiir-replaces-army-chief-paul-malong-170509211057369.html|title=South Sudan's Kiir replaces army chief Paul Malong|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/05/10/south-sudan-president-salva-kiir-replaces-army-chief-paul-malong-with_c1558490|title=South Sudan president Salva Kiir replaces army chief Paul Malong with James Ajongo|publisher=The Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Juba with his officials, but they did not reach their destination as they were accused of making rebellion. The officials in [[Yirol]] lured Gen. Paul Malong and his companions to get back to Juba because the government was in fear that they would sparked a rebellion. But Gen. Paul Malong expelled the accuse, saying to Eye Radio on phone from Yirol, "I want  to live as a normal person, as you know that this month of May is all concerning cultivation; my tractors are already in the fields that is why you have seen me heading to Aweil". Malong also said, "Whatever has been said, there is no reality, because if I wanted to have a problem, that problem should be in Juba," he told Radio Miraya FM, a United Nations radio station.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southsudan-military-idUSKBN1861ZO/ South Sudan's sacked army chief quits Juba, dismisses fears amid civil war], Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged war crimes==
During the [[Ethnic violence in South Sudan#Anti-Nuer pogroms (2013)|Anti-Nuer pogroms]] in 2013, much of the killings were carried out by a group known as "Dot Ke Beny" (Rescue the President) or "Mathiang Anoor" (Brown caterpillar), a militia of Dinkas formed for the protection of president Kiir and Paul Malong Awan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africanarguments.org/2016/07/11/whos-behind-south-sudans-return-to-fighting/|title=Who's behind South Sudan's return to fighting?|date=11 July 2016|accessdate=26 January 2017|work=African arguments}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US pushed for an arms embargo and sanctions on Machar and army chief Paul Malong Awan through the Security Council, but it failed to receive enough votes to pass in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/us-seeks-sanctions-on-south-sudan-rebel-leader-army-chief/2016/11/18/95a75fd4-ae11-11e6-8f19-21a1c65d2043_story.html|title=US seeks sanctions on South Sudan rebel leader, army chief|date=19 November 2016|publisher=washington post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4782">'''Refugee Nation''' is a 2015 proposal to create a new nation to voluntarily [[Population transfer|resettle]] the world's [[refugee]] population to solve [[refugee crisis|crisis]]. According to [[United Nations]] estimates, there are about 60 million refugees and internally displaced people in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sengupta|first1=Somini|title=60 Million People Fleeing Chaotic Lands, U.N. Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/world/60-million-people-fleeing-chaotic-lands-un-says.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Proposal==
Refugee Nation was launched in June 2015 by  and received extensive media coverage in July 2015, beginning with an article in ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Adam|title=A Silicon Valley mogul wants to solve the global refugee crisis by creating a new country|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/07/23/a-silicon-valley-mogul-wants-to-solve-the-global-refugee-crisis-by-creating-a-new-country/|website=WashingtonPost.com|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his proposal, Buzi offers a number of alternatives for creating a nation of refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ridley|first1=Louise|title=Millionaire Jason Buzi Wants To Create A New Country To House All The World's Refugees|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/07/27/refugee-nation-country-for-refugees-jason-buzi_n_7877662.html|website=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/|publisher=The Huffington Post UK|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

1. Buying uninhabited islands from a country such as the Philippines or Indonesia

2. A country with a lot of habitable but unused land giving away or selling this land for the purpose of establishing a refugee nation. One example given is Finland

3. A small island nation which is sparsely populated agreeing to become a refugee nation. Current citizens would receive significant financial benefits.

4. [[Artificial island|New islands]] to be created in international waters as a homeland for refugees.

==Funding==
Funding for Refugee Nation is proposed to be by governments, [[NGO]]s, the [[United Nations]] or private billionaires. [[Jason Buzi]], a successful [[Bay Area]] real estate investor, had previously earned positive press as the benefactor behind 2014's [[Hidden Cash]] multi-city project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ensor|first1=Josie|title=Secret millionaire behind HiddenCash treasure hunt announces London giveaways next|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10904771/Secret-millionaire-behind-HiddenCash-treasure-hunt-announces-London-giveaways-next.html|website=telegraph.co.uk|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Refugee Nation, Buzi has drafted the initial proposal, established an online presence ([http://www.refugeenation.org www.refugeenation.org]), and gained exposure for his plan through a [[Public relations|PR]] agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chung|first1=Frank|title=Real estate mogul's 'radical solution' to the global refugee crisis|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/real-estate-moguls-radical-solution-to-the-global-refugee-crisis/story-e6frflo9-1227458770700|website=news.com.au|publisher=News Corp Australia|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Refugee Nation launched a [[crowdfunding]] campaign with the aim of raising billions of dollars to buy land or islands as a permanent home for the world's refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lam|first1=Bourree|title=The Man Who Wants to Crowdfund a New Nation for Refugees|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/jason-buzi-refugee-nation/410728/|website=The Atlantic|publisher=Hayley Romer|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other related proposals==
Less than two months  after the proposal received wide media coverage, [[Naguib Sawiris]], an Egyptian billionaire, offered to buy a [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] island to house [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|refugees fleeing the Syrian conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mosbergen|first1=Dominique|title=Egyptian Billionaire Offers To Buy Island To Shelter Refugees In Europe|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/egyptian-billionaire-island-refugees_55e93066e4b093be51bb1d3a|website=The Huffington Post|publisher=The Huffington Post and Berggruen Institute|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Levy''' or '''Robert Lévy''' (9 January 1928, in [[Edesheim]] &amp;ndash; 1944) was a French Jewish [[physician]] who served with the German army in [[World War I]], for two years. During [[World War II]], he served as the prisoner-doctor at [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref name="Priemel/Stiller"&gt;Kim Christian Priemel, Alexa Stiller (2012), ''Reassessing the Nuremberg Military Tribunals: Transitional Justice, Trial Narratives, and Historiography.'' Berghahn Books, p. 93. "The prisoner doctor, Robert Levy,&lt;sup&gt;[91]&lt;/sup&gt; gave evidence about experimental operations in Auschwitz. He was a French citizen but had served with the German army in World War I for two years..." ''(see)'' "... most of the patients were very unhappy and psychologically broken by the serialization."

Robert Levy, was arrested on May 12, 1943, in Limoges and deported from Drancy on September 2, 1943, then deported to Auschwitz in 1944 and belonged to the [[concentration camp]] personnel conducting medical treatments at the [[Auschwitz II Birkenau]] [[death factory]]. He worked in the surgical block where the records were also kept. In his notes presented at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] (''SS im Einsatz'', 167/2),&lt;ref name="Schoenberner"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vW7cG2xi4wC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;dq=SS-+Dr+Robert+Levy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RDQ-0XvAhr&amp;sig=OdGd_9LvPcFV6VI7jaItq14q3_Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HS6kUbXcAoWvigKBkIHQCQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=SS-%20Dr%20Robert%20Levy&amp;f=false | title=Sources | publisher=Fordham Univ Press | work=The Yellow Star: The Persecutions of the Jews in Europe, 1933-1945 | year=2004 | accessdate=2013-05-27 | author=Gerhard Schoenberner | pages=284 | isbn=0823223906 | format=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lévy mentioned "losing" 96% of his patients on several different occasions. Every now and then, new selections among prisoners made to strip naked, were arranged on the block by head-doctor [[Friedrich Entress]] (see [[Mauthausen-Gusen camp trials]]). The injured – who were unable to return to work considerably quickly – were sent right away for the so-called "special handling" (''Sonderbehandlung'') at Block 20, which meant one thing: the phenol injection. Lévy seriously believed that he was actually performing medicine, that's why his notes were meticulous.&lt;ref name="Lifton"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bv8IAqVh8EAC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=Robert+Levy+SS-&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-DrPujqXos&amp;sig=Aa2UKxOQ8ScehSy9GXsCIOnG4SQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZyqkUYeSIue9iwLY6YHgBA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Robert%20Levy%20SS-&amp;f=false | title=Selections in the Camp | publisher=Basic Books | work=The Nazi doctors: medical killing and the psychology of genocide | year=2000 | accessdate=2013-05-27 | author=Robert Lay Lifton | pages=189&amp;ndash;182 | isbn=0465049052 | format=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lévy was one of the estimated 6,000 to 8,000 staff members thought to have been involved in the operation of the camp.&lt;ref name="Wittmann"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674063877 | title=Beyond Justice: the Auschwitz Trial | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2005 | accessdate=2013-05-28 | author=Rebecca Wittmann}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to deposition filed after World War II by his second cousin at [[Yad Vashem]] (providing that it was the same person), Lévy was born in Ensisheim, France in 1928 to Georgette and Sylvain Levy and he perished in 1944 while at Auschwitz.&lt;ref name="YV"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://db.yadvashem.org/names/nameDetails.html?itemId=935012&amp;language=en | title=Robert Levy | publisher=Yad Vashem The Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority | work=Central Database | year=2013 | accessdate=2013-05-28 | author=YV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The destruction of the European Jews - Page 607 Raul Hilberg - 1973   Affidavit by Dr. Robert Levy (survivor), November 19, 1946, NO-884. wanted to fortify the mass destructive aim with an ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born and raised in London, Rupert is the son of [[Jeremy Maas]] and Antonia Armstrong Willis. Rupert's parents had married in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-jeremy-maas-1286047.html|title=Obituary: Jeremy Maas|publisher=|accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert has an older sister Athena (born 1957) and a younger brother Jonathan (born 1962).&lt;ref&gt;https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/foVGRaCVcy9RhBUqz948SBsnpUE/appointments&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/_gZjP4NCqCe2psLWvpQvpNsJK_E/appointments&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thepeerage.com/p13899.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Rupert's father started the Maas Gallery in [[Mayfair]], [[London]], dealing in [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] paintings, writing a book in 1969, ''Victorian Painters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The pre-Raphaelites: behind the scenes at a modern blockbuster |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/aug/19/pre-raphaelites-avant-garde-tate-britain |work=The Observer |date=19 August 2012 |accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert Maas was educated at [[Sherborne School]] in [[Dorset]] from 1974 to 1978 and took a BA in Art History at the [[University of Essex]] from 1980 to 1983.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maasgallery.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=2 |title=About us |publisher=Maasgallery.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1983, he sailed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and later that year joined the Maas Gallery which deals in Victorian, Pre-Raphaelite, Romantic and Modern British paintings, watercolours, drawings, reproductive engravings and sculpture. The gallery has also featured the work of a number of contemporary living artists, including Keiron Leach and [[Julia Sorrell]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Maas served on the executive committee of the [[Society of London Art Dealers]] in 1998–99. He co-owns and runs The Watercolours and Drawings Fair. He has regularly written articles for the art, press and lectures on art. He is widely recognised as the leading expert on the works of the Royal Academician [[Augustus Leopold Egg]] (1816–1863).{{cn|date=November 2013}}   He also promotes [[Ballantine's]] whisky in the Far East.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

Maas is frequently called upon to provide independent valuations for museums, both domestic and international, and has previously valued individual pictures and entire collections (for example the [[John Wharlton Bunney]] 1828-1882 archive){{cn|date=November 2013}} for [[Acceptance in Lieu]]. In 2006 Maas was duped into paying £20,000 for a faked art work claimed to be by fairyland painter [[John Anster Fitzgerald]] (1823–1906).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/untrained-painter-conned-art-world-with-fakes-416636.html|title=Untrained painter conned art world with fakes|publisher=|accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Maas became full-time director of the Maas Gallery. In 1997, shortly after his father's death, he joined [[BBC]]'s ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' as a picture specialist. He has appeared regularly on the series and on other television programmes such as ''Castle in the Country''. In late 2008 he caused a minor local controversy when he implied, in an episode of ''Antiques Roadshow'', that women from [[Shropshire]] had fat ankles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WI fights back over 'fat ankle' jibe |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/wi-fights-back-over-fat-ankle-jibe-1041650.html |work=The Independent |date=30 November 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2008/12/03/its-official-county-ankles-are-super/ "It's official - county ankles are super!"], ''Shropshire Star'', 3 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

Known for his ability to reel off spontaneous art-related witticisms, one of his best known and oft-quoted quips pertains to vetting an artwork's authenticity by bearing in mind that "Everything but the naked picture is capable of lying."{{cn|date=May 2014}}

In December 2015 Maas appeared on the team representing [[University of Essex]] on [[BBC Four]]'s ''[[Christmas University Challenge]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b06tl3l6/university-challenge-christmas-2015-4-christs-cambridge-v-essex|title=University Challenge - Christmas 2015: 4. Christ's, Cambridge v Essex|publisher=|accessdate=1 December 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life ==
Maas is married to Tamar Seaborn since 1991. The couple have three daughters.&lt;ref name="ukwhoswho.com"/&gt; Maas lives in [[Camberwell]] in south [[London]] and is 6 feet 6 inches (1.98m) in height.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

'''Samuel Gridley Howe''' (November 10, 1801 – January 9, 1876) was a nineteenth century United States physician, [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], and an advocate of education for the [[blindness|blind]]. He organized and was the first director of the [[Perkins School for the Blind|Perkins Institution]].

An abolitionist, in 1863, he was one of three men appointed by the Secretary of War to the [[American Freedmen's Inquiry Commission]], to investigate conditions of [[freedmen]] in the South since the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and recommend how they could be aided in their transition to freedom. In addition to traveling to the South, Howe traveled to [[Canada West]] (now [[Ontario, Canada]]), where thousands of former slaves had escaped to freedom and established new lives; he interviewed freedmen as well as government officials in Canada.

==Early life and education==
Howe was born on Pearl Street in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] on November 10, 1801.&lt;ref name="Richards, Laura E. page 13"&gt;Richards, Laura E. (Howe). ''Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe'', p. 13. Boston: Dana Estes &amp; Company, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; His father Joseph Neals Howe was a ship-owner and [[Rope|cordage]] manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Laura E. (Howe). "Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe", page 14. Boston: Dana Estes &amp; Company, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Patty (Gridley) Howe was considered to be one of the most beautiful women of her day.&lt;ref name="Richards, Laura E. page 13"/&gt;

Howe was educated at [[Boston Latin School]], where he was cruelly treated, and even beaten, according to his daughter.&lt;ref name="Richards, Laura E. page 14"&gt;Richards, Laura E. (Howe). ''Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe'', page 14. Boston: Dana Estes &amp; Company, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; Laura (Howe) Richards later wrote: "So far as I can remember, my father had no pleasant memories of his school days."&lt;ref name="Richards, Laura E. page 14"/&gt;

Boston in the early nineteenth century was a hotbed of political foment. Howe's father was a Democrat who considered [[Harvard University]] a den of [[Federalist Party|Federalists]], and refused to allow his sons to enter the university.&lt;ref name="Richards, Laura E. page 14"/&gt; Accordingly, in 1818, Howe's father had him enrolled at [[Brown University]].&lt;ref name="Richards, Laura E. page 15"&gt;Richards (1909), ''Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe'', page 15&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his time there was spent engaged in practical jokes and other hi-jinx and, years later, Howe told his children that he regretted that he hadn't more seriously applied himself to his studies.&lt;ref name="Richards, Laura E. page 15"/&gt; One of his classmates, [[Alexis Caswell]], became a doctor and future president of Brown University; he described Howe by the following: "He showed mental capabilities which would naturally fit him for fine scholarship. His mind was quick, versatile, and inventive. I do not think he was deficient in logical power, but the severer studies did not seem to be congenial to him."&lt;ref&gt;Richards (1909), ''Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from Brown in 1821, Howe attended [[Harvard Medical School]], taking his [[Doctor of Medicine|degree]] in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;Richards (1909), ''Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe'', pp. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samuel_Gridley_Howe_-_John_Elliot.jpg|thumb|left|Samuel Gridley Howe painted in the dress of a Greek soldier by [[John Elliott (artist)|John Elliott]]. Elliott married Howe's daughter [[Maud Howe Elliott|Maud Howe]].]]

==Greek Revolution==

Howe did not remain in Massachusetts for long after graduating. In 1824, shortly after Howe was certified to practice medicine, he became fired by enthusiasm for the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Revolution]] and the example of his idol [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]]. Howe fled the memory of an unhappy love affair and sailed for [[Greece]], where he joined the Greek army as a [[surgery|surgeon]].&lt;ref name="Richards, Laura E. page 14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards (1909), ''Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe'', pages 21-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece his services were not confined to the duties of a surgeon, but were of a more military nature. Howe's bravery, enthusiasm, and ability as a commander, as well as his humanity, won him the title "the Lafayette of the Greek Revolution."&lt;ref name="NIE"&gt;''[[New International Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Howe returned to the United States in 1827, to raise funds and supplies to help alleviate the [[famine]] and suffering in Greece.&lt;ref name="Richards, Laura E. pages 279"&gt;Richards (1909), ''Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe'', p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; Howe's fervid appeals enabled him to collect about $60,000 which he spent on provisions, clothing, and the establishment of a relief depot for refugees near [[Aegina]].&lt;ref name="Richards, Laura E. pages 279"/&gt; He later formed another colony for exiles on the Isthmus of [[Corinth]]. Afterwards, Howe wrote an account of the revolt, ''Historical Sketch of the Greek Revolution'', which was published in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;Richards (1909), ''Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe'', p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Greece, Howe continued his medical studies in Paris. His enthusiasm for a [[Republicanism|republican]] form of government led him to take part in the [[July Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz,&lt;/span&gt; Harold. ''Samuel Gridley Howe, Social Reformer, 1801-1876'', Page 38. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ. Press, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work for the blind==

In 1831 he returned to the United States. Through his friend [[John Dix Fisher|Dr. John Dix Fisher]], a Boston physician who had started a movement there as early as 1826 to establish a school for the blind, he had learned of a similar school founded in Paris by [[Valentin Haüy]]. A committee organized by Fisher proposed to Howe that he direct the establishment of a New England Asylum for the Blind at Boston. He took up the project with characteristic ardor, and set out at once for Europe to investigate the problem.&lt;ref name="learningtogive.org"&gt;Hall, Emily M. ''Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe'', Graduate Student, Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. http://learningtogive.org/papers/paper105.html Accessed 25 Jan 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Perkins School.jpg|thumb|Perkins School, prior to 1915]]
In America he met and was chosen to bring money to the Polish revolutionaries,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SMHuGrfdNugC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=American+Polish+Committee+Paris+Samuel+Howe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMI3tS5hdXjyAIVCZmICh0qwA-d#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20Polish%20Committee%20Paris%20Samuel%20Howe&amp;f=false The manliest man pg 55-57]&lt;/ref&gt; thus he left with two missions, to establish schools for the blind and as chairman of the American-Polish Committee at Paris, organized with [[James Fenimore Cooper|J. Fenimore Cooper]], [[Samuel F. B. Morse|S. F. B. Morse]], and several other Americans living in the city, to support the revolutionaries. The Poles were defeated by the Russians and Howe was to give money to the many, particularly officers, who did not want to return home and harassed people of neighboring countries, while they were given political refuge and crossed over the Prussian border into Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Laura E. ''Two Noble Lives,'' Page 23. Boston: Dana Estes &amp; Company, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Howe undertook to distribute the supplies and funds personally, and while in Berlin, he was arrested and imprisoned, but managed to destroy or hide the discriminating letters to the Polish officers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SMHuGrfdNugC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=American+Polish+Committee+Paris+Samuel+Howe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMI3tS5hdXjyAIVCZmICh0qwA-d#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20Polish%20Committee%20Paris%20Samuel%20Howe&amp;f=false The manliest man Samuel Howe pag 55-57]&lt;/ref&gt; After five weeks, he was released due to the intervention of the United States Minister at Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Laura E. ''Two Noble Lives,'' Page 24-29. Boston: Dana Estes &amp; Company, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Boston in July 1832, Howe began receiving a few blind children at his father's house in Pleasant Street. He gradually developed what became the noted [[Perkins School for the Blind|Perkins Institution]].&lt;ref name="learningtogive.org"/&gt; In January 1833 the funds available were all spent, but so much progress had been shown that the legislature approved funding, later increased to $30,000 a year, to the institution on condition that it should educate gratuitously twenty poor blind from the state. Collections of funds were also contributed from Salem and Boston. Colonel [[Thomas Handasyd Perkins]], a prominent Boston trader in slaves, furs, and opium, presented his mansion and grounds in Pearl Street as a location for the school in perpetuity. This building was later found unsuitable and Colonel Perkins consented to its sale. In 1839 the institution was moved to the former Mount Washington House Hotel in South Boston. It was henceforth known as the ''Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum (or, since 1877, School for the Blind.'')

Howe was director, and the life and soul of the school; he opened a printing-office and organized a fund for printing for the blind — the first done in the United States. He was a ceaseless promoter of their work. Through him, the Institution became one of the intellectual centers of American philanthropy, and by degrees obtained more and more financial support. In 1837, Howe brought to the school [[Laura Bridgman]], a young [[deaf-blind]] girl who later became a teacher at the school.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Laura E. ''Two Noble Lives,'' Page 32. Boston: Dana Estes &amp; Company, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; She became famous as the first known deaf-blind person to be successfully educated in the United States.  Howe taught Bridgman himself.  Within a few years of attendance at Perkins Institution, she learned the [[manual alphabet]] and how to write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perkins Annual Reports|url=https://archive.org/stream/annualreportoftr110perk#page/n131/mode/2up/search/bridgman|accessdate=28 May 2014|page=131|year=1839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Howe originated many improvements in teaching methods, as well as in the process of printing books in [[Braille]].&lt;ref name="learningtogive.org"/&gt;  Besides acting as superintendent of the Perkins Institution to the end of his life, he was instrumental in establishing numerous institutions of a similar character throughout the country.

On 23 April 1843, at the age of 41, he married the younger [[Julia Ward Howe|Julia Ward]], the daughter of wealthy New York banker [[Samuel Ward (banker)|Samuel Ward]] and Julia Rush (Cutler) Ward.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, Valarie H. 'Diva Julia: The Public Romance and Private Agony of Julia Ward Howe,'' page 31. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Julia was an ardent supporter of abolitionism and was later active in the cause of Woman's [[Suffrage]]. She composed the "[[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" during the [[American Civil War]].

They had a passionate and stormy marriage.&lt;ref name="Venet, Wendy Hamand page 95"&gt;Venet, Wendy Hamand. ''Neither Ballots Nor Bullets: Women Abolitionists and the Civil War,'' page 95. University of Virginia Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Julia wrote in her diary of Dr. Howe (whom she referred to as "Chev"):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chev is one of the characters based upon opposition. While I always seem to work for an unseen friend, he always sees an armed adversary and nerves himself accordingly. So all our lives turn on what I may call moral or personal fiction...&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, Valarie H. 'Diva Julia: The Public Romance and Private Agony of Julia Ward Howe,'' page 107. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At one point Samuel requested a legal separation, but Julia refused.&lt;ref name="Venet, Wendy Hamand page 95"/&gt; Many of their arguments centered on Julia's desire to have a career apart from motherhood.&lt;ref name="Ziegler, Valarie H page 8"&gt;Ziegler, Valarie H. 'Diva Julia: The Public Romance and Private Agony of Julia Ward Howe,'' page 8. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; While Dr. Howe was in many ways progressive by the standards of the day, he did not support the idea of married women having any work other than that of wife and mother. He believed that Julia's proper place was in the home.&lt;ref name="Ziegler, Valarie H page 8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, Valarie H. 'Diva Julia: The Public Romance and Private Agony of Julia Ward Howe,'' page 27. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple had six children: Julia Romana Howe (1844–1886), who married Michael Anagnos, a Greek scholar who succeeded Dr. Howe as director of the Perkins Institute;&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, Valarie H. 'Diva Julia: The Public Romance and Private Agony of Julia Ward Howe,'' page 141. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Florence Marion Howe (1845–1922), an author, wrote a well-known treatise on manners and married David Prescott Hall, a lawyer; Henry Marion Howe (1848–1922), a metallurgist who lived in New York; [[Laura E. Richards|Laura Elizabeth Howe]] (1850–1943), a [[Pulitzer prize]]-winning author,&lt;ref name="Ziegler, Valarie H page 11"&gt;Ziegler, Valarie H. 'Diva Julia: The Public Romance and Private Agony of Julia Ward Howe,'' page 11. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; married Henry Richards and lived in Maine; [[Maud Howe Elliott|Maud Howe]] (1855–1948), a [[Pulitzer prize]]-winning author,&lt;ref name="Ziegler, Valarie H page 11"/&gt; married  [[John Elliott (artist)|John Elliott]], an English muralist and illustrator; and Samuel Gridley Howe, Jr. (1858–1863), who died at age five.

Laura and Florence were closest to their father and defended his opposition to Julia's activities outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, Valarie H. 'Diva Julia: The Public Romance and Private Agony of Julia Ward Howe,'' page 103. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Florence later took up her mother's mantle as a committed suffragette, making public speeches on the subject and writing the book, ''Julia Ward Howe and the Woman Suffrage Movement'' (1913).&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Florence Howe. ''Julia Ward Howe and the Woman Suffrage Movement.'' Boston: Dana Estes &amp; Company, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Florence Howe. ''Memories Grave and Gay,'' pp. 269-270. New York: Harper &amp; Bros., 1918&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antislavery activities==
Howe entered publicly into the antislavery struggle for the first time in 1846, when as a "[[Conscience Whigs|Conscience Whig]]", he was an unsuccessful candidate for [[United States Congress|Congress]] against [[Robert Charles Winthrop|Robert C. Winthrop]].&lt;ref name="NIE" /&gt; He was one of the founders of an antislavery newspaper, the Boston ''Daily Commonwealth'', which he edited (1851–1853) with the assistance of his wife [[Julia Ward Howe]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Emily M. ''Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe'', Graduate Student, Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. http://learningtogive.org/papers/paper105.html Accessed 24 Jan 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a prominent member of the [[Bleeding Kansas|Kansas Committee]] in Massachusetts. With [[Franklin Benjamin Sanborn]], [[George Luther Stearns]], [[Theodore Parker]], and [[Gerrit Smith]], he was interested in the plans of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]. Although he disapproved of the attack upon [[Harper's Ferry, West Virginia|Harper's Ferry]], Howe had funded [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown's]] work as a member of the [[Secret Six]].&lt;ref name="law.umkc.edu"&gt;Linder, Douglas. ''The Trial of John Brown: The Secret Six'', http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/Ftrials/johnbrown/secretsixdetails.html{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Accessed 24 Jan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After Brown's arrest, Howe temporarily fled to Canada to escape prosecution.&lt;ref name="law.umkc.edu"/&gt;

According to later accounts by Howe's daughter, Florence Hall, the Howes' South Boston home was a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;Silber, Irwin. ''Songs of the Civil War'', Page 10. New York: Courier Dover Publications, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This is uncertain, but it is known that Dr. Howe vehemently opposed the [[Fugitive Slave Law]]. Two incidents clearly demonstrate this. The first occurred in May 1854, when Dr. Howe along with [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]], [[Theodore Parker]] and other abolitionists, stormed [[Faneuil Hall]] in order to try to free a captured escaped slave, [[Anthony Burns]]. Burns was going to be sent back to his slave owner in Virginia in accordance with the Fugitive Slave Law.&lt;ref name="Walther, Eric H. Page 47-48"&gt;Walther, Eric H. ''The Shattering of the Union'', Page 47-48 Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The abolitionists hoped to rescue Burns from that fate. Howe declared outside the hall that "No man's freedom is safe until all men are free."&lt;ref name="Walther, Eric H. Page 47-48"/&gt; Shortly afterward the abolitionists stormed the hall, breaking through the door with a battering ram. A deputy was accidentally shot in the ensuing fracas.&lt;ref name="Walther, Eric H. Page 47-48"/&gt; Federal troops finally put an end to the attempted raid, and Burns was returned to Virginia.&lt;ref name="Walther, Eric H. Page 47-48"/&gt; The men did not abandon Burns, however, and within a year of his capture, they had raised enough money to purchase Burns' freedom from his slave owner.&lt;ref name="Walther, Eric H. Page 47-48"/&gt;

In another violation of the Fugitive Slave Law, in October 1854, with the help of Capt. [[Austin Bearse]] and his brother, Dr. Howe rescued an escaped slave&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, Irving H. ''Wendell Phillips, Brahmin Radical'', Page 184. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; who had entered Boston Harbor from Jacksonville, Florida as a stowaway aboard the brig ''Cameo''.&lt;ref name="Siebert, Wilbur H. Page 81"&gt;[[Wilbur H. Siebert|Siebert, Wilbur H.]] ''The Underground Railroad from Slavery to Freedom'', Page 81. London: MacMillan &amp; Co., 1898&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Vigilance Committee]] helped the man evade slave-catchers and reach freedom.&lt;ref name="Siebert, Wilbur H. Page 81"/&gt;

In 1863 during the [[American Civil War]], Dr. Howe was appointed to the [[American Freedmen's Inquiry Commission]], and traveled both to the [[Deep South]] and to Canada to investigate the condition of emancipated slaves. Freedmen in Canada had often reached it via the Underground Railroad.&lt;ref name="Calarco, Tom Page 121"&gt;Calarco, Tom. ''The Underground Railroad in the Adirondack Region'', Page 121. New York: McFarland, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Life in Canada wasn't free from the bigotry that [[Freedman|Freedmen]] and women suffered in the northern states as well as the South, but Howe found that their lives as free people were much improved. He noted that they were enfranchised and their rights protected by the government.&lt;ref name="Calarco, Tom Page 121"/&gt; Howe noted they were free to earn a living, marry, attend school and church out of the reach of slave-catchers.&lt;ref name="Calarco, Tom Page 121"/&gt; An account of his interviews and experiences were published in 1864, ''The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/refugeesfromslav00howe ''The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West.'']&lt;/ref&gt; He submitted his report to the Secretary of War, and it became part of the Commission's material for Congress. It contributed to passage of the law establishing the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], considered needed to aid the southern freedmen in transition.

==Civil War and Reconstruction==
During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Howe was one of the directors of the [[United States Sanitary Commission|Sanitary Commission]]. The goal of the Sanitary Commission was to raise funds to improve hygiene standards and prevent outbreaks of disease at Union camps, which were breeding grounds for illnesses like [[dysentery]], [[typhoid]] and [[malaria]], as well as to provide supplies and medical services to troops.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, George Worthington. ''Doctors in Blue: The Medical History of the Union Army in the Civil War.'' Louisiana State University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

At the close of the Civil War, Dr. Howe entered into the work of the [[Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands|Freedmen's Bureau]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Laura E. (Howe). ''Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe'', page 479. Boston: Dana Estes &amp; Company, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; His work with the Freemen's Bureau served as an extension of his work as an abolitionist. It was the job of the Freedmen's Bureau to help house, feed, clothe, educate and provide medical care to newly freed slaves in the South after the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, Augusta County, Virginia. http://valley.vcdh.virginia.edu/HIUS403/freedmen/fb-socialservices.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, Augusta County, Virginia. http://valley.vcdh.virginia.edu/HIUS403/freedmen/fs-intro.html&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, Bureau staff would also try to aid the [[freedmen]] to locate and reunite with relatives who had either fled north or who had been sold away during slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Robert. "Welfare and Employment Policies of the Freedmen's Bureau in the District of Columbia," ''Journal of Southern History.'' (1 Feb 2006) http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-15007364_ITM Accessed 25 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropic activities==
Dr. Howe, working with [[Dorothea Dix]], also brought about the establishment of the ''Massachusetts School for Idiot and Feeble-Minded Youth'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=H0280 Accessed 24 Jan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ragged-edge-mag.com"&gt;Pfeiffer, David. ''Samuel Gridley Howe and 'Schools for the Feebleminded''', http://www.ragged-edge-mag.com/0103/0103ft2.html Accessed 24 Jan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the Western Hemisphere's oldest publicly funded institution serving the mentally disabled. He founded the school in 1848 with a $2,500 appropriation from the Massachusetts Legislature.&lt;ref name="brown.edu"&gt;Mitchell, Martha. ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana '', https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=H0280 Accessed 24 Jan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; "Idiot" was at that time considered a polite term for individuals with mental and intellectual disabilities. Dr. Howe was successful in his attempt to educate the mentally disabled, but this led to other problems. Some commentators argued that the disabled did so well in schools such as Howe's that they should permanently reside there.&lt;ref name="ragged-edge-mag.com"/&gt; Dr. Howe was opposed to this, arguing that the mentally disabled had rights and that segregating them from the rest of society would be detrimental.&lt;ref name="ragged-edge-mag.com"/&gt;

In 1866, Howe gave the keynote address at the opening of the New York State Institution for the Blind at Batavia, New York. He shocked the audience by warning about the dangers of segregation based on disability:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We should be cautious about establishing such artificial communities...for any children and youth; but more especially should we avoid them for those who have natural infirmity...Such persons spring up sporadically in the community, and they should be kept diffused among sound and normal persons...Surround insane and excitable persons with sane people and ordinary influences; vicious children with virtuous people and virtuous influences; blind children with those who see; mute children with those who speak; and the like...&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Samuel G. ''In ceremonies on laying the corner-stone of the New York State institution for the blind, at Batavia, Genessee County, New York'', Batavia, N.Y.:  Henry Todd, 1866&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Howe founded the State Board of Charities of Massachusetts in 1863, the first board of the sort in the United States. He served as its chairman from that time until 1874.&lt;ref&gt;''The Columbia Encyclopedia: Sixth Edition'', http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-Howe-Sam.html Accessed 24 Jan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Howe made a last trip to Greece in 1866, to carry relief to the [[Crete|Cretan]] refugees during the Cretan Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Spofford, Harriet Prescott. "In the Greek Revolution," ''New York Times'', (July 17, 1909) https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/07/17/101029589.pdf Accessed 24 Jan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years and death==
Samuel Howe remained active and politically involved until the end of his life.

In 1865, Howe openly advocated a progressive tax system, which he referred to as a "sliding scale of taxation proportionate to income."&lt;ref name="Cumbler, John T. Page 138"&gt;Cumbler, John T. ''From Abolition to Rights for All: The Making of a Reform Community in the Nineteenth Century,'' p. 138, Philadelphia: Univ. of Pennsylvania Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the wealthy would resist this, but explained that the United States could not become a truly just society while the gap between rich and poor remained so cavernous. Emancipating the slaves and charity work alone were not enough, he insisted, to bridge the inequities, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;so long as the labors and drudgery of the world is thrown actively upon one class, while another class is entirely exempt from it. There is a radical injustice in it. And injustice in society is like a rotten timber in the foundation of a house.&lt;ref name="Cumbler, John T. Page 138"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1870 he was a member of the commission sent by [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Grant]] to inquire into the practicability of the annexation of [[Dominican Republic|Santo Domingo]]. President Grant wished to annex the island. He was opposed in this effort by Sen.[[Charles Sumner]], a longtime friend and ally of Howe's.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Charles Sumner. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/573433/Charles-Sumner&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the committee sided with Sumner in opposition to the proposed annexation.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; Grant was so enraged at having his plans thwarted that he arranged to have Sumner removed from his chairmanship as head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

Samuel Gridley Howe died on January 9, 1876. His remains are buried in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

'''Serfiraz Hanım''' ({{lang-ota|سرفراز خانم}}; {{circa}} 1837 – 9 June 1905) was the sixteenth wife of Sultan [[Abdulmejid I]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Early life==
Serfiraz Hanım was born in 1837 in [[Abkhazia]]. Born as Ayşe Liah, she was a member of the [[Abkhaz people|Abkhazian]] princely family, Liah. Her father was Prince Osman Bey Liah and her mother was Zeliha Hanım Tapsın.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=71}} She had two sisters, Princess Hüsnümah Hanım and Princess Agâh Hanım.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=72}}

Ayşe had been brought to Istanbul, where her father entrusted her to the imperial harem, where her name according to the custom of the Ottoman court was changed to Serfiraz.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=71}}

==Marriage==
Serfiraz married Abdulmejid in 1851.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=71}} She was given the title of "Altıncı Ikbal". On 9 June 1852, a year after the marriage, she gave birth to her first child, a son, Şehzade Osman Seyfeddin in the Old Çırağan Palace. He died at the age of three.{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=214, n. 30}} She was then given the title of "Beşinci Ikbal", and in 1853, she was given the title of "Dördüncü Ikbal".{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=212 n. 24}} She was then given the title of Üçüncü Ikbal, and in 1855,{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=595}} the title of "Ikinci Ikbal". In 1857, she gave birth to her second child, a daughter, Bedia Sultan, who died a month old.{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=214, 231}} Two years later, on 25 July 1860, she gave birth to her third child, a son, Şehzade Selim Süleyman.{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=214}}

Serfiraz Hanım was Abdulmejid's favourite wife. He had alocated her to Yıldız Mansion.{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=213}}

==Later years==
After Abdulmejid's death on 25 June 1861, Serfiraz and her a year old son, Şehzade Süleyman, settled in a mansion located in Ortaköy.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=72}}{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=598}}

In the year of 1885 the Sultan's sisters, daughters and wives are said to have incurred a debt of 288,000 purses, approximately 1.15 million pounds sterling, of which, Serfiraz alone was responsible for 125,000 purses, approximately 500,000 pounds sterling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Candan|last=Badem|title=The” Ottoman Crimean War: (1853 - 1856)|publisher=BRILL|year=2010|pages=300|isbn=978-9-004-18205-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 1898, Serfiraz attended the wedding of Naime Sultan, the daughter of Sultan Abdul Hamid II and Kemaleddin Pasha, the son of Ghazi Osman Pasha.{{sfn|Brookes|2010|p=160, 285}}

[[Hamide Ayşe Sultan]], daughter of Abdul hamid  II, notes in her memoirs that during her father's reign, Serfiraz would attend Ramadan celebrations, and would always sit next to [[Perestu Kadın]].{{sfn|Brookes|2010|p=185}}

==Death==
Serfiraz Hanım settled with her son in his Bebek Palace,{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=599}} where she died on 9 June 1905. She was buried in the mausoleum of Şehzade Ahmed Kemaleddin in Yahya Efendi Cemetery, [[Istanbul]].{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=73}}{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=214}}{{sfn|Brookes|2010|p=290}}

'''Silvia del Carmen Süller''' (born 10 February 1958) is an [[Argentine]] media and television personality, [[Bombshell (sex symbol)|bombshell]], occasional singer and ex glamour model. She's the elder sister of television personality [[Guido Süller]] and ex soccer player Marcelo Süller, they both also well known in [[Argentina]].

Her first appearance on Argentine TV was on 30 March 1986, in [[Silvio Soldán]]'s show ''Grandes Valores del Tango''. She fell in love with the TV host and married him a few months later, having a baby, Christian Silvio, in 1991. In 1987, she had her first cosmetic surgery, a [[breast implant]], which would help her in her future [[showgirl]] career.

When she and Soldán split up in 1992, she started her high-profile career, working as a showgirl in many theater shows with Argentine comedians such as Jorge Corona, Beto César, José Luis Gioia, Carlos Sánchez and Tristán, among others, throughout the 1990s and the early 2000s (decade). She had a very successful showgirl career, though she defines herself as a "show-woman".

In 1997 she recorded a music album called ''Sullermanía''.

In 2007, she took part in ''[[Bailando por un sueño (Argentina)|Bailando por un sueño]]'' (literally "Dancing for a dream") a TV show very similar to ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'', being the first eliminated.

Her life has been largely exposed in the media and the tabloids, so that the public could see her involved in a lot of scandals, including her ex-husband, ex mother-in-law, her parents, her brothers, her sister Norma and national celebrities such as [[Moria Casán]] o [[Jorge Rial]].

She has stated several times that she is a personal admirer of American star [[Marilyn Monroe]] (she named her daughter after Monroe) and [[Susana Giménez]]. On April 8, 2011, Süller was compared to British celebrity [[Katie Price]] in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.

'''''Sugata Saurabha''''' ([[Devanagari]]: सुगत सौरभ) is an epic poem in [[Nepal Bhasa]] by [[Chittadhar Hridaya]] (1906 – 1982), one of the greatest literary figures from Nepal in the 20th century. ''Sugata Saurabha'', meaning “The Fragrant Life of the Buddha”, is based on the life story of [[Gautama Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/oso/public/content/religion/9780195341829/toc.html |title=Sugata Saurabha: An Epic Poem from Nepal on the Life of the Buddha by Chittadhar Hridaya |publisher=Oxford Scholarship Online |accessdate=24 February 2013 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Written in jail==

''Sugata Saurabha'' is Hridaya's greatest work which he composed while in prison from 1941 to 1945 in [[Kathmandu]]. He was given a six-year jail sentence for writing a poem in his mother tongue, which the autocratic [[Rana dynasty|Rana]] regime sought to suppress.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Todd T., and Tuladhar, Subarna Man (2009). ''Sugata Saurabha - An Epic Poem from Nepal on the Life of the Buddha by Chittadhar Hridaya.'' New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-534182-9}}. Page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hridaya wrote ''Sugata Saurabha'' in secret in prison, and his sister [[Moti Laxmi Upasika]] would smuggle out the scraps of paper on which he had scribbled the verses when she brought him his food.

==The storyline==

''Sugata Saurabha'' relates the Buddha's life from birth to enlightenment to death in 19 chapters. The life story is based on classical sources, but Hridaya has filled in details from the Nepalese sociocultural context where they are not mentioned.

The epic has been described as providing an aesthetically pleasing and doctrinally sound comprehensive account of the Buddha's life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/oso/public/content/religion/9780195341829/toc.html |title=Sugata Saurabha: An Epic Poem from Nepal on the Life of the Buddha by Chittadhar Hridaya |publisher=Oxford Scholarship Online |accessdate=24 February 2013 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a magnum opus in [[Nepal Bhasa literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Mahendra Man |title=Reading the ‘Kavi Kesari’ |url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2011/01/07/books/reading-the-kavi-kesari/216976/ |accessdate=24 February 2013 |newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|date=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19 chapters in ''Sugata Saurabha'' are entitled: 1. Lumbinī 2. Family Tree 3. Nativity 4. Mother 5. A Pleasant Childhood 6. Education 7. Marriage 8. The Great Renunciation 9. Yashodharā 10. Attaining Enlightenment 11. The Basic Teachings 12. The Blessed One in Kapilavastu 13. Handsome Nanda 14. The Great Lay Disciple 15. Twelve Years of Itinerant Preaching 16. A Dispute over Water 17. The Monastery Built by Vishākhā 18. Devadatta's Sacrilege and 19. Entry into Nirvāna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Sugata Saurabha: An Epic Poem from Nepal on the Life of the Buddha by Chittadhar Hridaya |publisher=Oxford Scholarship Online |date= |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195341829.001.0001/acprof-9780195341829 |doi-broken-date=2018-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First publication==

Hridaya finished the epic in 1946, a year after he was released from prison. ''Sugata Saurabha'' was first published from [[Kolkata]], India in 1949. Artist [[Chandra Man Singh Maskey]], who was in jail with Hridaya for alleged political activities, did the color illustrations in ''Sugata Saurabha''.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Todd T., and Tuladhar, Subarna Man (2009). ''Sugata Saurabha - An Epic Poem from Nepal on the Life of the Buddha by Chittadhar Hridaya.'' New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-534182-9}}. Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==English translations==

Two English versions of ''Sugata Saurabha'' have been published. In 1998, an English translation by Tirtha Raj Tuladhar was published by the Nepal Bhasa Academy, Kathmandu.

In 2010, [[Oxford University Press]] published an English translation by Todd T. Lewis and Subarna Man Tuladhar.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Todd T., and Tuladhar, Subarna Man (2009). ''Sugata Saurabha - An Epic Poem from Nepal on the Life of the Buddha by Chittadhar Hridaya.'' New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-534182-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis and Tuladhar won the 2011 Toshihide Numata Book Prize awarded by the Center for Buddhist Studies at the [[University of California]], Berkeley for their translation of the epic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Sugata Saurabha wins book prize |url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2011/10/25/et-cetera/sugata-saurabha-wins-book-prize/227587.html |accessdate=24 February 2013 |newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|date=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Yūrei'''|[[wikt:幽霊|幽霊]]}} are figures in [[Japanese folklore]], analogous to Western legends of [[ghost]]s. The name consists of two [[kanji]], [[wikt:幽|幽]] (''yū''), meaning "faint" or "dim" and [[wikt:霊|霊]] (''rei''), meaning "soul" or "spirit". Alternative names include 亡霊 (Bōrei), meaning ruined or departed spirit, 死霊 (Shiryō) meaning dead spirit, or the more encompassing 妖怪 ([[Yōkai]]) or お化け ([[Obake]]).

Like their [[Chinese folklore|Chinese]] and Western counterparts, they are thought to be [[soul|spirit]]s kept from a peaceful [[afterlife]].

==Japanese afterlife==
According to traditional Japanese beliefs, all humans have a [[spirit]] or [[soul]] called a [[wiktionary:霊魂|霊魂]] (''[[reikon]]''). When a person dies, the ''reikon'' leaves the body and enters a form of [[purgatory]], where it waits for the proper [[funeral]] and post-funeral [[rites]] to be performed, so that it may join its [[ancestor worship|ancestors]].{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=81-85}} If this is done correctly, the ''reikon'' is believed to be a protector of the living family and to return yearly in August during the [[obon|Obon Festival]] to receive thanks.{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=139-140}}

However, if the person dies in a sudden or violent manner such as [[murder]] or [[suicide]], if the proper rites have not been performed, or if they are influenced by powerful emotions such as a desire for [[revenge]], [[love]], [[jealousy]], [[hatred]] or [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]], the ''reikon'' is thought to transform into a ''yūrei'', which can then bridge the gap back to the [[Earth|physical world]]. The emotion or thought need not be particularly strong or driving, and even innocuous thoughts can cause a death to become disturbed. Once a thought enters the mind of a dying person, their Yūrei will come back to complete the action last thought of before returning to the cycle of reincarnation.{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=81}}

The ''yūrei'' then exists on Earth until it can be laid to rest, either by performing the missing [[ritual]]s, or resolving the emotional conflict that still ties it to the physical [[Plane (metaphysics)|plane]]. If the rituals are not completed or the conflict left unresolved, the ''yūrei'' will persist in its [[haunting]].{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=149}}

Oftentimes the lower the social rank of the person who died violently, or who was treated harshly during life, the more powerful as a ''yūrei'' they would return. This is illustrated in the fate of Oiwa in the story ''[[Yotsuya Kaidan]]'', or the servant Okiku in ''[[Banchō Sarayashiki]]''.

==Appearance==
In the late 17th century, a game called [[Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai]] became popular,{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=53}} and [[kaidan]] increasingly became a subject for [[theater]], [[literature]] and other arts.{{sfn|Balmain|2008|p=16-17}} [[Ukiyo-e]] artist [[Maruyama Ōkyo]] created the first known example of the now-traditional yūrei, in his painting ''[[The Ghost of Oyuki]]''.{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=27-30}} The [[Zenshō-an]] in Tokyo houses the largest single collection of ''yūrei'' paintings which are only shown in August, the traditional month of the spirits.{{sfn|Zensho-an}}

Today, the appearance of yūrei is somewhat uniform, instantly signalling the ghostly nature of the figure, and assuring that it is culturally authentic.

* '''White clothing:''' Yūrei are usually dressed in white, signifying the white burial [[kimono]] used in [[Edo period]]  funeral rituals. In [[Shinto]], white is a color of ritual [[Virtue|purity]], traditionally reserved for priests and the dead.{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=44}} This kimono can either be a ''katabira'' (a plain, white, unlined kimono) or a ''kyokatabira'' (a white katabira inscribed with Buddhist sutras). They sometimes have a ''[[hitaikakushi]]'' (lit., "forehead cover"), which is a small white triangular piece of cloth tied around the head.{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=45-46}}
* '''Black hair:''' The hair of a yūrei is often long, black and disheveled, which some believe to be a trademark carried over from [[kabuki|kabuki theater]], where wigs are used for all actors.{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=48}} This is a misconception: Japanese women traditionally grew their hair long and wore it pinned up, and it was let down for the funeral and burial.
* '''Hands and feet:''' A yūrei's hands dangle lifelessly from the wrists, which are held outstretched with the elbows near the body. They typically lack legs and feet, floating in the air. These features originated in Edo period [[ukiyo-e]] prints, and were quickly copied over to kabuki.{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=49}} In kabuki, this lack of legs and feet is often represented by using a very long kimono or even hoisting the actor into the air by a series of ropes and pulleys.{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=49-50}}
* '''Hitodama:''' Yūrei are frequently depicted as being accompanied by a pair of floating flames or [[will o' the wisp]]s ([[hitodama]] in Japanese) in eerie colors such as blue, green, or purple. These ghostly flames are separate parts of the ghost rather than independent spirits.{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=215}}

==Classifications==

===Yūrei===
While all Japanese ghosts are called yūrei, within that category there are several specific types of phantom, classified mainly by the manner they died or their reason for returning to Earth.

* [[Onryō]]: [[Vengeful ghost]]s who come back from [[purgatory]] for a wrong done to them during their lifetime{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=215}}
* [[Ubume]]: A mother ghost who died in [[childbirth]], or died leaving young children behind.  This yūrei returns to care for her children, often bringing them sweets{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=216}}
* [[Goryō]]: Vengeful ghosts of the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic class]], especially those who were [[martyred]]{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=214}}
* [[Funayūrei]]: The ghosts of those who died at sea. These ghosts are sometimes depicted as scaly fish-like humanoids and some may even have a form similar to that of a [[mermaid]] or [[merman]]{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=214}}
* [[Zashiki-warashi]]: The ghosts of children, often mischievous rather than dangerous{{sfn|Blacker|1963|p=87}}
* {{Nihongo|Earth-bound spirits|地縛霊|jibakurei|lead=yes}}: Something of a rarity among Yūrei, these spirits do not seek to fulfill an exact purpose and are instead bound to a specific location or situation.{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=129}} Famous examples of this include the famous story of [[Okiku]] and the haunting in [[Ju-On: The Grudge]].{{sfn|Davisson|2014|pp=129-130}}

===Buddhist ghosts===
There are two types of ghosts specific to [[Buddhism]], both being examples of unfulfilled earthly hungers being carried on after death. They are different from other classifications of yūrei due to their wholly religious nature.

* [[Preta|Gaki]]
* [[Jikininki]]{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=214}}{{sfn|Hearn|2006|p= 43-47}}

===Ikiryō===
In Japanese folklore, not only the dead are able to manifest their reikon for a haunting.  Living creatures possessed by extraordinary jealousy or rage can release their spirit as an [[ikiryō]] 生き霊, a living ghost that can enact its will while still alive.{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=214}}

The most famous example of an ikiryo is Rokujō no Miyasundokoro, from the novel ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''. A mistress of the titular Genji who falls deeply in love with him, the lady Rokujō is an ambitious woman whose ambition is denied upon the death of her husband. The jealousy she repressed over Genji transformed her slowly into a demon, and then took shape as an Ikiryō upon discovering that Genji's wife was pregnant. This Ikiryō possessed Genji's wife, ultimately leading to her demise. Upon realising that her jealousy had caused this misfortune, she locked herself away and became a nun until her death, after which time her spirit continued to haunt Genji until her daughter performed the correct spiritual rites.{{sfn|Meyer|2014|p = Rokujō no Miyasundokoro}}{{sfn|Murasaki|2010|p=679-693}}

==Hauntings==
Yūrei often fall under the general umbrella term of [[obake]], derived from the verb bakeru, meaning "to change"; thus obake are preternatural beings who have undergone some sort of change, from the natural realm to the supernatural.

However, Yūrei differ from traditional ''bakemono'' due to their temporal specificity. The Yūrei is one of the only creatures in Japanese mythology to have a preferred haunting time (the hour of the bull, around 2:00-2:30am, the [[wikt:witching hour|witching hour]] for [[Japan]], when the veils between the world of the dead and the world of the living are at their thinnest). By comparison, normal ''obake'' could strike at any time, often darkening or changing their surroundings should they feel the need.{{sfn|Foster|2014|p=23}} Similarly, Yūrei are more bound to specific locations of haunting than the average ''bakemono,'' which are free to haunt any place without being bound to it.''{{sfn|Reider|2010|p=162}}''

[[Yanagita Kunio]] generally distinguishes Yūrei from Obake by noting that Yūrei tend to have a specific purpose for their haunting, such as vengeance or completing unfinished business.{{sfn|Yanagita|1970|pp=292-293}} While for many Yūrei this business is concluded, some Yūrei such as the famed Okiku remain earthbound due to the fact that their business is not possible to complete. In Okiku's case, this business is counting plates hoping to find a full set, but the last plate is invariably missing or broken according to the different retellings of the story. This means that her spirit can never find peace, and thus will remain a ''jibakurei''.{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p = 111-112}}

===Famous hauntings===
Some famous locations that are said to be haunted by yūrei are the well of [[Himeji Castle]], haunted by the ghost of [[Bancho Sarayashiki|Okiku]], and [[Aokigahara]], the forest at the bottom of [[Mt. Fuji]], which is a popular location for suicide.  A particularly powerful onryō, [[yotsuya kaidan|Oiwa]], is said to be able to bring vengeance on any actress portraying her part in a theater or film adaptation.

Okiku, Oiwa, and the lovesick Otsuya together make up the {{Nihongo|''San O-Yūrei''|三大幽霊|lead=yes|extra="three great Yūrei"}} of Japanese culture. These are Yūrei whose stories have been passed down and retold throughout the centuries, and whose characteristics along with their circumstances and fates have formed a large part of Japanese art and society.{{sfn|Davisson|2014|p=87}}

==Exorcism==
The easiest way to exorcise a yūrei is to help it fulfill its purpose. When the reason for the strong emotion binding the spirit to Earth is gone, the yūrei is satisfied and can move on.  Traditionally, this is accomplished by family members enacting revenge upon the yūrei's slayer, or when the ghost consummates its passion/love with its intended lover, or when its remains are discovered and given a proper burial with all rites performed.

The emotions of the onryō are particularly strong, and they are the least likely to be pacified by these methods.

On occasion, Buddhist priests and [[yamabushi|mountain ascetics]] were hired to perform services on those whose unusual or unfortunate deaths could result in their transition into a vengeful ghost, a practice similar to [[exorcism]]. Sometimes these ghosts would be [[Tenjin (kami)|deified]] in order to placate their spirits.

Like many monsters of [[Japanese folklore]], malicious yūrei are repelled by {{nihongo|''[[ofuda]]''|御札}}, holy Shinto writings containing the name of a [[kami]].  The ofuda must generally be placed on the yūrei's forehead to banish the spirit, although they can be attached to a house's entry ways to prevent the yūrei from entering.
