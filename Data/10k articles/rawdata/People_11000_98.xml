During the '''Parade of Nations''' at the [[2012 Summer Paralympics opening_ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Paralympic Games]], athletes from each participating country paraded in the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]], preceded by its flag. The flag was borne by a sportsperson from that country chosen either by the [[National Paralympic Committee]] or by the athletes themselves.

==Parade order==
All nations paraded in alphabetical order except the host country, [[Great Britain]], who entered last.

== Countries and flag bearers ==
The following is a list of all parading countries with their respective flag bearer, sorted in the order they appeared in the parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Opening Ceremony flag bearers|url=http://www.paralympic.org/news/list-opening-ceremony-flag-bearers|work=paralympic.org|publisher=[[International Paralympic Committee]]|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is sortable by country name under which they entered, the flag bearer's name, or the flag bearer's sport.

==Activism==

===2007===
In February 2007, he became an active participant in the [[Iraq Veterans Against the War]] (IVAW). On March 19, 2007, to mark the 4th anniversary of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Kokesh and 12 other IVAW members participated in an occupation-like mock patrol of Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anti-war Iraq vets stage mock patrol D.C. residents get a taste of occupation |author=David Montgomery |newspaper=[[The Journal Gazette]] |page=6.A |date=March 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kokesh first came to national attention after he was interviewed on CNN and his photograph appeared in various newspapers, including the front page of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' at a protest during [[Alberto Gonzales]]'s testimony to [[United States Congress|Congress]] regarding the [[Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy|dismissal of U.S. attorneys]]. Kokesh, wearing his Marine Corps [[Boonie hat]], held up a sign counting the number of times Gonzalez said "I don't remember" or "I don't recall" (Kokesh claimed Gonzalez used such phrases 74 times).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The AG hearing: A post-mortem |author=Paul Kane |work=The Washington Post |date=April 20, 2007 |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/capitol-briefing/2007/04/the_ag_hearing_a_post_mortem.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705143430/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/capitol-briefing/2007/04/the_ag_hearing_a_post_mortem.html |archivedate=July 5, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adam Kokesh (2038489467).jpg|thumb|Kokesh speaking at an anti-war protest in September 2007.]]
In April 2007, Kokesh and a number of other activists were arrested for protesting the Iraq war in the [[Senate Hart Office Building]]. Kokesh had performed a ceremony for lost service members using an American flag.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Security_Industry/2007/06/04/Marine-veteran-protester-faces-discharge/UPI-15871180980041/ Marine veteran, protester faces discharge], [[United Press International]], June 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, Kokesh, along with IVAW members [[Liam Madden]] and Nate Lewis, was arrested for crossing onto [[Fort Benning]] during an anti-war protest. A spokesperson for the IVAW said the three had accidentally stepped onto the base while talking to a guard. The trespass charges were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.accessnorthga.com/detail.php?n=94628 |title=Trespass charges against veteran protesters dropped |work=AccessNorthGa.com |date=June 14, 2007 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=June 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kokesh enrolled in graduate studies in political management at [[George Washington University]].&lt;ref name="Montgomery"&gt;David Montgomery, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/01/AR2007060102421.html "In Clash With Marines, Reservists Gain Ally in VFW"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', June 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, Kokesh, along with six other students, created controversy by putting up mock political posters across the university campus to mock what they called the Islamophobic racist "Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week" being observed at the campus. The event was organized by a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] student organization, and invited speaker [[David Horowitz]] on the George Washington University campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gwhatchet.com/2007/10/08/anti-muslim-posters-cause-stir-administrative-response/|title=Anti-Muslim posters cause stir, administrative response|newspaper=[[The GW Hatchet]]|date=October 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roper |first=Eric |url=http://www.gwhatchet.com/2007/10/08/seven-gw-students-admit-to-hanging-controversial-posters/ |title=Seven GW students admit to hanging controversial posters |publisher=Gwhatchet.com |date=2013-05-13 |accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===

On July 12, 2008, Kokesh spoke at the Revolution March, which took place on the west lawn of the Capitol in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Hancock, [https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/Article/035768-2008-07-15-adam-kokeshs-speech-revolution-march-07-12-2008.htm Kokesh's speech (Revolution March) 07-12-2008] [Freedoms Phoenix] July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 2008, Kokesh spoke at [[Ron Paul's Rally for the Republic]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;David Weigel, [http://washingtonindependent.com/71424/anti-war-activist-mounts-gop-campaign-for-congress  Anti-War Activist Mounts GOP Campaign for Congress] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522232322/http://washingtonindependent.com/71424/anti-war-activist-mounts-gop-campaign-for-congress |date=May 22, 2013 }}, [[American Independent News Network|The Washington Independent]], December 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 4, 2008, Kokesh interrupted Senator [[John McCain]]'s acceptance speech of the GOP nomination for president at the [[2008 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in [[St. Paul]], Minnesota. Holding a sign reading "McCain Votes Against Vets" on one side and "You can't win an occupation" on the other,&lt;ref&gt;Indianapolis Star, [http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080904/NEWS0502/80904055 McCain's speech interrupted by protestors] September 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Kokesh yelled, "Ask him why he votes against vets!" Kokesh was detained by local police and released soon after.&lt;ref&gt;The American Prospect, [http://prospect.org/article/interview-mccain-heckler-adam-kokesh McCain Heckler Detained, Handcuffed, and Released Outside Excel Center] September 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010===

On October 15, 2009 Kokesh filed with the [[Federal Election Commission|FEC]] to run for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[New Mexico's 3rd congressional district]] as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/226/29992942226/29992942226.pdf|title=FEC FORM 2|date=October 15, 2009|first=Adam Charles|last=Kokesh|work=[[Federal Election Commission]]|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually lost the nomination to businessman Tom Mullins, who went on to lose the November general election to incumbent Democrat [[Ben Ray Luján]].

===2011===
On May 28 Kokesh and other activists participated in a [[flash mob]]-silent dance at the [[Thomas Jefferson Memorial]] in Washington, D.C. in protest of a recent ruling against dancing in the monument. Kokesh, along with four others including [[Medea Benjamin]] of [[Code Pink]], was arrested by the [[U.S. Park Police]] for demonstrating without a permit. Kokesh was told he was under arrest after dancing a jig. He refused officers orders and was subsequently body-slammed onto the marble floor and put in a choke hold, then cuffed. The aggressive nature of the arrests raised concerns about the actions of some of the officers and prompted an internal investigation by the Park Police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Segraves|first=Mark|title=

About 10 minutes after the dancing began, police began clearing the monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dancers-shimmy-at-the-jefferson-memorial/2011/06/04/AGb284IH_story.html| author=Lori Aratani| title=Dancers shimmy at the Jefferson Memorial|work=The Washington Post| date=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; No arrests were made. When asked by a journalist if he had a permit to protest, Kokesh reportedly produced a copy of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and said, "Actually I got a permit. It's the same one I swore an oath to when I enlisted in the Marine Corps. And it says something about '[[freedom of assembly]].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===2012===
On February 20, 2012, after a "Veterans for Ron Paul" rally organized by Kokesh, 500 marchers, including veterans, active-duty service, and their families, marched towards the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/veterans-ron-paul-2012-march-white-house-twitter-photo-slideshow-413992|author=Connor A.

===2013===
In May, Kokesh announced an "Open Carry March on Washington" where thousands of marchers bearing arms would cross from Virginia into Washington, D.C. on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] to protest strict gun laws.

On May 18, Kokesh, along with other protesters, was arrested in Philadelphia by U.S. National Park Service Rangers&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service Archives&lt;/ref&gt; at the fifth iteration of a marijuana legalization rally known as Smoke Down Prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/24-7/2013/05/19/adam-kokesh-arrested-at-anti-prohibition |title=Adam Kokesh Arrested at Anti-Prohibition Protest in Philly – Reason 24/7 |publisher=Reason.com |date=2013-05-19 |accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kokesh and Philadelphia marijuana advocate N.A.

The day before his May 24 release, Kokesh penned a press release calling for a "Final American Revolution" to take place on July 4 in place of the previously planned armed march on Washington D.C. This was to be "A new American revolution" where "the American Revolutionary Army will march on each state capital to demand that the governors of these 50 states immediately initiate the process of an orderly dissolution of the federal government through secession and reclamation of federally held property."&lt;ref name=media/&gt;

On July 4, Kokesh posted a YouTube video of himself allegedly loading a shotgun in [[Freedom Plaza]] in the District of Columbia in open defiance of DC law. In the 23-second video shot early that morning and titled "Open Carry March on DC a Success," as the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] looms in the distance, Kokesh loads the shotgun while addressing the camera. Police indicated they believed he may have used a [[green screen]] and on his return to the plaza on July 8 he insisted data from government [[Surveillance state|surveillance]] cameras in Freedom Plaza would show he was there. "I was here, and I loaded a shotgun on Independence Day, but I didn't kill anybody. I didn't drone any children. I didn't steal any children's future. I didn't sell this country into debt. I didn't do any of the crimes that the man two blocks over at the White House is responsible for," he told the reporter. "I was ready to stand by my word, and I was ready to commit the [[civil disobedience]] that I had committed to," he said. "Now that we have a year, now that we're doing something that's much more open-sourced, we're going to be marching again next Independence Day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Open-Carry-March-Activist-Says-Shotgun-Video-Was-Real-214656041.html |title='Open Carry March' Activist Says Shotgun Video Was Real

On the evening of July 9, a [[United States Park Police#USPP SWAT Team|U.S. Park Police SWAT team]] raided Kokesh's house in [[Herndon, Virginia]], executing a search warrant for the shotgun and raw footage from the July 4 video. With helicopters providing air support, the [[police officers]] knocked then kicked in the door and lobbed a [[flash grenade]] in the foyer, filling the house with smoke. Police clad in [[body armor]] stormed in and handcuffed Kokesh and his housemates, who alleged [[Police brutality|mistreatment]] during the raid and the ensuing five-hour search, which allegedly turned up the shotgun and [[Psilocybin mushroom]]s. Kokesh was charged with possession of [[Controlled Substances Act|Schedule I or II]] drugs and possession of a gun with Schedule I or II drugs, both felonies. Kokesh refused to leave his cell to be arraigned and fingerprinted, but was arraigned by a judge in his cell the next day. A statement posted on Kokesh's website read, "We will continue to spread the message of liberty, [[self-ownership]] and the [[non-aggression principle]] regardless of the government’s relentless attacks on our operation."&lt;ref name="shrooms"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/activist-adam-kokesh-reportedly-arrested-in-herndon/2013/07/10/73dbc8c2-e943-11e2-8f22-de4bd2a2bd39_story.html|title=Adam Kokesh charged with possessing hallucinogenic mushrooms|publisher=Washington Post|date=July 10, 2013|accessdate=October 30, 2013|first1=Justin|last1=Jouvenal|first2=Trishula|last2=Patel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Riggs|first=Mike|title=SWAT Team Raids Home of Libertarian Activist Adam Kokesh, Arrests Him on Drug and Gun Charges|url=http://reason.com/blog/2013/07/10/swat-team-raids-home-of-libertarian-acti|accessdate=30 October 2013|newspaper=Reason|date=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacDonald|first=Gregg|title=Libertarian activist arrested in Herndon|url=http://www.fairfaxtimes.com/article/20130710/NEWS/130719699/1076/NEWS/Libertarian-activist-arrested-in-Herndon&amp;template=fairfaxTimes|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130831190041/http://www.fairfaxtimes.com/article/20130710/NEWS/130719699/1076/NEWS/Libertarian-activist-arrested-in-Herndon&amp;template=fairfaxTimes|dead-url=yes|archive-date=31 August 2013|accessdate=30 August 2013|newspaper=Fairfax Times|date=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a jailhouse interview on July 18 Kokesh denied any connection to the drugs found in the raid, implying they were [[Planting evidence|planted]].

In a jailhouse interview with Fox 5 DC, Kokesh announced his plans to run for President of the United States in 2020 on a platform of an orderly dissolution of the U.S. Federal Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gabbee|title=Fox News Interviews Adam Kokesh from Jail|date=2013-07-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD5FMZb-AL0|accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, Kokesh posted bail in Virginia and was immediately rearrested by U.S. Park Police for breaking a D.C. law forbidding bearing arms which carries a penalty of up to five years in jail, in connection with his Freedom Plaza video. Magistrate Judge Lori Parker ordered Kokesh to remain in the [[D.C. jail]] over the weekend because, she said, he had violated the rules of his release in another case. Specifically, she noted that in June 2013, Kokesh was charged with possession of marijuana after he was arrested on the south side of the White House allegedly smoking a marijuana cigarette. On July 29 D.C. Superior Court Judge Frederick Sullivan, calling Kokesh "a very dangerous man," ordered him to remain in D.C. jail until trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtop.com/109/3401798/Kokesh-transferred-to-DC-faces-charge-related-to-gun-loading-video |title=Activist Adam Kokesh charged with openly carrying shotgun in D.C. |publisher=WTOP.com |date=2013-07-26 |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Keith L.

On November 6, Kokesh was released from jail after waiving his right to a trial and pleading guilty to the July 4 weapons charges and a marijuana possession charge from the June 8 White House protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=Keith L.|title=Virginia gun rights advocate Adam Kokesh pleads guilty to gun charges, released from jail|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/virginia-gun-rights-advocate-adam-kokesh-pleads-guilty-to-gun-charges-released-from-jail/2013/11/06/337f7ff8-4708-11e3-b6f8-3782ff6cb769_story.html|newspaper=Washington Post|date=2013-11-06|accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WJLA"&gt;{{cite news|title=Adam Kokesh pleads guilty to weapon, drug charges|url=http://www.wjla.com/articles/2013/11/adam-kokesh-pleads-guilty-to-weapon-drug-charges-96492.html|work=WJLA.com|publisher=Allbritton Communications Company|date=2013-11-06|accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2014, Kokesh was sentenced to two years of probation. At his sentencing he apologized for his actions but defended his right to protest. He told the judge he was not a violent person, but just wanted to make a statement. "The only time I was violent was when I was a Marine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=Keith L.|title=Judge sentences Virginia gun-rights advocate, Adam Kokesh, to probation

On June 12, Kokesh, after entering an [[Alford plea]] in Circuit Court to two felonies related to his possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms while possessing a gun, was convicted of drug and gun charges. Although he did not contest the charges, he called the raid that led to his arrest "political persecution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/va-court-convicts-gun-rights-activist-adam-kokesh/2014/06/12/30eb6d3c-f262-11e3-9ebc-2ee6f81ed217_story.html|title=Va. court convicts gun rights activist Adam Kokesh|first=Justin|last=Jouvenal|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=June 12, 2014|accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kokesh received a suspended sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/adam-kokesh-gets-no-jail-time-on-drug-gun-convictions/2014/09/05/e9aa0d0a-353e-11e4-8f02-03c644b2d7d0_story.html|title=Adam Kokesh gets no jail time on drug, gun convictions|first=Justin|last=Jouvenal|date=September 5, 2014|work=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016===
Kokesh embarked on the "For the Love of FREEDOM!" tour in August 2016. The tour, featuring over 60 stops and including all of the 48 contiguous states, served as an exploratory tour for his 2020 Presidential run. Free copies of his book, ''FREEDOM!'', were given away to all in attendance at each event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thefreedomline.com/calendar/|title=Calendar - The FREEDOM!

===2017===
In April 2017, Kokesh had organized a demonstration in front of the [[White House]] as a protest against the Syrian bombing campaign, but before it could start Kokesh was arrested on an outstanding warrant for failing to appear in court on charges related to him disrupting a [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] security line in [[Maryland]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Gun-Rights-Activist-Arrested-as-Fugitive-of-Justice-419214824.html|title=Gun Rights Activist Adam Kokesh Arrested as Fugitive of Justice|first=Jackie|last=Bensen|date=April 11, 2017|work=[[WRC-TV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''FREEDOM!'' ==
While in jail after his 2013 arrest stemming from his Freedom Plaza civil disobedience, Kokesh began work on his book, ''FREEDOM!''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://acronymjournal.com/2014/07/03/adam-kokeshs-independence-day-call-to-arms-revisited/ |title=Adam Kokesh’s Independence Day Call To Arms Revisited |last=Trainor |first=Dennis |last2=Jr. |date=2014-07-04 |website=The Acronym Journal |access-date=2016-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127215002/https://acronymjournal.com/2014/07/03/adam-kokeshs-independence-day-call-to-arms-revisited/ |archivedate=November 27, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positions ==

=== Government ===
Kokesh views government as the greatest cause of violence in the world today and believes that governmental coercion is just as undesirable as coercion performed by a private citizen. He believes that government should be abolished in order to reduce violence and build a society based on respect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He has announced plans to run for President of the United States in 2020 on the platform of an orderly dissolution of the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adamkokesh.com/|title=FREEDOM! 2020 adamkokesh.com|website=adamkokesh.com|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individualism ===
Kokesh is an advocate for self-ownership, the idea that each person owns himself. He believes that any act of violence or threat of violence between individuals represents a violation of someone's freedom.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=FREEDOM!|last=Kokesh|first=Adam|publisher=The FREEDOM! Fund|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=1–2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxation ===
Kokesh believes that [[Taxation as theft|taxation is theft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=FREEDOM!|last=Kokesh|first=Adam|publisher=The FREEDOM! Fund|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=40|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign policy ===
Kokesh supports a [[Non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybell.com/exclusive-interviews/anthony-wile-adam-kokesh-progression-to-a-freer-society-is-inevitable/|title=Adam Kokesh: Progression to a Freer Society Is Inevitable - The Daily Bell|website=www.thedailybell.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abortion ===
Kokesh is against [[Abortion in the United States|abortion]] but believes that government should have nothing to do with it. He also believes, while he doesn't care for titles, that life begins at conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steemit.com/abortion/@adamkokesh/on-abortion|title=Who here is pro abortion? — Steemit|website=steemit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Adam vs. The Man''==
''Adam vs. The Man'' was a [[talk show]] which was available in a variety of formats, such as [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]], web-access, [[podcast]] and [[Facebook]]-linked [[YouTube]] channel. Initially airing in 2011 as an evening two-hour broadcast on [[KIVA (AM)|KIVA AM 1550]] [[talk radio]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], ''Adam vs. The Man'' then shifted to a half-hour video news format on RT before fully moving to the internet as an hour-long video podcast.  On April 7, 2014, AVTM 4.0 was launched from Los Angeles, CA, and could be viewed live daily from noon to 2 PM, Pacific Time.

===RT America===
''Adam vs. The Man'' was [[license]]d by [[RT (TV network)|Russia Today]]'s [[RT America|US affiliate]] in April 2011. The move was criticized by [[Accuracy in Media]]'s columnist [[Cliff Kincaid]] who referenced his own column entry from 2008 discussing RT's coverage of the [[Russo-Georgian War|Russia–Georgian War]] in which he condemned RT for "preferring to use foreigners, especially Americans, to make Russian propaganda points"&lt;ref&gt;Cliff Kincaid, [http://www.aim.org/aim_column/4184_0_3_0_C "Hostile Takeover of Fox News"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227014515/http://www.aim.org/aim_column/4184_0_3_0_C |date=December 27, 2005 }}, November 21, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cliff Kincaid, [http://www.aim.org/aim-column/russian-tv-sounds-like-soviet-tv/ Russian TV Sounds Like Soviet TV], [[Accuracy in Media]], August 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; before stating that "the American Marine Veteran, Adam Kokesh, seems to fit the bill, having emerged as an anti-war activist who ran as a Republican for Congress and supported Rep. [[Ron Paul]] (R-TX) for president".&lt;ref&gt;Cliff Kincaid, [http://www.aim.org/aim-column/kgb-tv-to-air-show-hosted-by-anti-war-marine-vet/ KGB TV to Air Show Hosted by Anti-war Marine Vet], [[Accuracy in Media]], April 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' writer [[David Weigel]] quoted Kokesh describing RT's model, saying: "Truth is the best propaganda. I love it! I really love the concept of that. It's funny: People say we're hiding shit as a network. No, no—we put the fact that this is propaganda right out front. We're putting out the truth that no one else wants to say. I mean, if you want to put it in the worst possible abstract, it's the Russian government, which is a competing [[protection racket]] against the other governments of the world, going against the United States and calling them on their bullshit."&lt;ref&gt;David Weigel, [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/pravda_will_set_you_free.single.html Pravda Will Set You Free; Russia's answer to Fox News and MSNBC.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', June 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

After only a few months on RT, ''Adam vs. The Man'' was canceled in August by that network to avoid potential legal problems stemming from an FEC complaint filed against RT by the group [[America’s Survival, Inc.]] over the matter of Kokesh endorsing Ron Paul for President (thereby allegedly running afoul of the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Film appearances==
Kokesh appears in the role of "A Soldier" in the 2016 film ''The Prey'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blockbusterone.online/the-prey/ |title=Rent The Prey (2018) Online |publisher=Blockbuster Online |accessdate=February 1, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as himself in the documentaries ''The Road to Fallujah'' (2008), ''For Liberty: How the Ron Paul Revolution Watered the Withered Tree of Liberty'' (2009), ''Owned &amp; Operated'' (2012), ''Derrick J's Victimless Crime Spree'' (2012), ''ShadowRing'' (2015), and ''Gray State: The Rise'' (2015).

On January 19, 2013, Kokesh appeared as a future version of himself at an anti-war-debt rally scene in the 2014 sci-fi thriller, ''[[Alongside Night#Movie|Alongside Night]]''. Kokesh wrote the speech he delivered, a tribute to the character of Dr. Martin Vreeland (played by [[Kevin Sorbo]]), in the background during an action sequence. Most of the speech plays during the movie's end credits and the unedited full speech is on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jneilschulman.agorist.com/2013/10/three-new-alongside-night-videos/|title=Three New Alongside Night Videos «  J.

'''Arkad Chubanov''' (1840–1894) was a Buddhist priest of [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]] origin who was born in the Ike Burul aimak in the Salsk District of the [[Don Cossack Host]] sometime in 1840.

Lama Chubanov was born in 1840 in the Namrovskaia sotnia of the Ike Burul aimak. He was the second son of Chuban Manzhikov. His uncle, Roman Manzhikov, was the Baksha of the khurul in his native aimak. Following his uncle's path, Arkad Chubanov became a mandji (novice) at the age of 9, serving until the age of 13 in 1853. He then furthered his studies of Buddhism under the guidance of [[Djimba Gandjinov|Lama Djimba Gandjinov]] and then in the Bolshederbotovskii ulus under [[Sandji Yavanov|Lama Sandji Yavanov]], the Ochir Lama.

After he completed his studies in 1872, Arkad Chubanov returned home to become a monk in his native khurul. He remained in that position until 1873, when he was elected to replace [[Koti Badjuginov]] as "Lama of the Don Kalmyks" - the spiritual leader of the Kalmyk community in the Salsk District of the [[Don Cossack Host]].

Upon becoming the Lama of the Don Kalmyks, Arkad Chubanov promoted education among Buzava (or Don Kalmyk) youth. In his native Namrovskaia sotnia, for example, Arkad Chubanov established a parish school - the first official school for Buzava youth in the Salsk District and perhaps the first school for Kalmyk boys in general. Arkad Chubanov also compiled and published the Kalmyk lunar calendar.

Arkad Chubanov died in 1894 after serving 21 years as Lama of the Don Kalmyks. He was succeeded by [[Djimba Mikulinov|Lama Djimba Mikulinov]], the Baksha of the khurul in the Ike Burul aimak.

'''Arron Fraser Andrew Banks''' (born March 1966) is a British businessman and political donor.

Banks was one of the largest donors to the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) and bankrolled [[Nigel Farage]]’s campaign to leave the EU. A British parliamentary committee report concluded; "Arron Banks is believed to have donated £8.4m to the Leave campaign, the largest political donation in British politics, but it is unclear from where he obtained that amount of money"; "He failed to satisfy us that his own donations had, in fact, come from sources within the UK."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chair comments on the decision to refer Arron Banks to the National Crime Agency|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/arron-banks-nca-quote-17-19/|website=www.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has been reported to have had multiple meetings with [[Embassy of Russia, London|Russian embassy]] officials&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/08/arron-banks-met-russian-ambassador-11-times-lucrative-deals |title=Revealed: Leave.EU campaign met Russian officials as many as 11 times |work=The Guardian |date=8 July 2018 |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as offered business opportunities in Russia in the run-up to the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit referendum]].&lt;ref name="guardmultiple" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/16/leave-eu-russia-arron-banks-andy-wigmore|title=Leave.

He claimed he was suspended from UKIP in March 2017, but UKIP said his membership had "lapsed earlier in the year".&lt;ref name=laura&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/14/ukip-suspends-donor-aaron-banks-party/ |title=Ukip 'suspends' donor Aaron Banks from the party |author=Laura Hughes |work=Daily Telegraph |date=14 March 2017 |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Banks was raised by his mother in [[Basingstoke]], [[Hampshire]]; his father worked as a [[sugar plantation]] manager in various African countries. From the age of 13 he attended a boarding school in [[Berkshire]] called Crookham Court, before being expelled for "an accumulation of offences", including the sale of [[lead]] stolen from the roofs of school buildings, and "high-spirited bad behaviour". He then attended [[St Bartholomew's School]] in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]] but was expelled again. Returning to Basingstoke, where he sold paintings, vacuum cleaners, and then houses, when aged 21 he married his first wife, Caroline, with whom he has two daughters.&lt;ref name="New Statesman 2016-10-13"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/10/arron-banks-man-who-bought-brexit |title=Arron Banks: The man who bought Brexit |first=Martin |last=Fletcher |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=13 October 2016 |accessdate=16 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks' first marriage lasted ten years and in 2001 he married Russian [[Ekaterina Paderina]], the mother of three more children.&lt;ref name="New Statesman 2016-10-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite news |last=Pickard |first=Jim |last2=Stacey |first2=Kiran |title=Tycoon Arron Banks unrepentant for backing Ukip|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/59c74846-a2e0-11e4-ac1c-00144feab7de.html |newspaper=The Financial Times |date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paderina is reported to have received help to remain in the UK from [[Mike Hancock (British politician)|Mike Hancock]] while he was an MP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Swinford |first=Steven |last2=Rayner |first2=Gordon |title=Russian 'spy' case: Liberal Democrat MP 'helped second Russian girl' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8186328/Russian-spy-case-Liberal-Democrat-MP-helped-second-Russian-girl.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Banks reportedly lived in the village of [[Tockington]] near [[Bristol]] in a house with a "huge" [[Union Jack]] flying over the front lawn, and owned another house overlooking a [[game reserve]] near [[Pretoria]] in South Africa.&lt;ref name="New Statesman 2016-10-13"/&gt;

==Business career==
Banks was offered a junior job at the insurance market of [[Lloyd's of London]]. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', by the age of 27, he was running a division of [[Norwich Union]]. The article also claims that he spent a year working for [[Berkshire Hathaway]], the investment company of [[Warren Buffett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Booth |first=Robert |date=27 March 2016 |title=Arron Banks: the millionaire hoping to bankroll UK into Brexit |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/27/arron-banks-the-millionaire-hoping-to-bankroll-uk-into-brexit |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in another investigation, both Norwich Union and Warren Buffett reject Banks' claim that he worked for them.&lt;ref name="openDemocracy-20171015"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/brexitinc/adam-ramsay/how-did-arron-banks-afford-brexit|title=How did Arron Banks afford Brexit?|date=16 October 2017|website=openDemocracy|language=en|access-date=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, from an office above a bakery in [[Thornbury, Gloucestershire|Thornbury]], Gloucestershire, Banks started a motorcycle insurance broker, Motorcycle Direct, and within a few years the company was big enough to sell for "a few million". He used the money to found Commercial Vehicle Direct about which he says "within a very short period we were the largest van insurance company in the country".&lt;ref name="globalreinsurance-20110817"&gt;{{cite news |last=East |first=Saxon |date=17 August 2011 |title=Arron Banks, Brightside |url=https://www.globalreinsurance.com/arron-banks-brightside/1392318.article |newspaper=globalreinsurance.com |access-date=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Statesman 2016-10-13"/&gt; Over seven years, along with Australian business partner John Gannon, Banks expanded this business to become Group Direct Limited, and in 2008 the company [[Initial public offering|floated]] by means of a [[reverse takeover]] as [[Brightside Group]]. He was its CEO from June 2011 to June 2012, at which time the company was listed on the [[Alternative Investment Market]] (AIM).&lt;ref name="growthbusiness-20070515"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.growthbusiness.co.uk/the-entrepreneur/be-an-entrepreneur/255598/arron-banks-and-john-gannon-talk-about-serial-deal-making.thtml |title=Arron Banks and John Gannon talk about serial deal making |author=Andrew Chilvers |newspaper=growthbusiness.co.uk |date=15 May 2007 |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Arron Fraser Andrew Banks |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=24346118&amp;ticker=MFX:LN&amp;previousCapId=881464&amp;previousTitle=MANX%20FINANCIAL%20GROUP%20PLC|website=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalreinsurance-20110817"/&gt; After Banks was dismissed from the company in 2012, he sold £6m worth of the shares in 2013, and received significantly more when the investment firm [[AnaCap Financial Partners]] bought Brightside the following year.&lt;ref name="openDemocracy-20171015"/&gt;

Banks was the chief executive (CEO) of Southern Rock Insurance Company in 2014,&lt;!-- Can't seem to find sources more recent --&gt; which underwrites insurance policies for the website GoSkippy.com, founded by Banks.&lt;ref name="hague"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Watt|first1=Nicholas |last2=Morris |first2=Steven |last3=Syal|first3=Rajeev|title=Former Tory donor raises Ukip donation to £1m over Hague comments |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/01/tory-donor-arron-banks-increases-ukip-donation-william-hague |accessdate=1 June 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Go Skippy founder Banks to bankroll UKIP |url= http://www.insuranceage.co.uk/insurance-age/news/2373187/go-skippy-founder-banks-to-bankroll-ukip |work=InsuranceAge |accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Banks' departure, Brightside took legal action against him, alleging he used confidential information in setting up GoSkippy.com six months later. There were also legal actions between Southern Rock and Brightside.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent-"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ukip-s-1m-donor-arron-banks-is-accused-of-conspiracy-by-his-old-company-9773912.html |title=Ukip's £1m donor Arron Banks is accused of conspiracy by his old company |author=Paul Gallagher |newspaper=The Independent |date=3 October 2014 |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was previously CEO of AIM-listed [[Conister|Manx Financial Group]] from April 2008 to February 2009.&lt;ref name="growthbusiness-20070515"/&gt; According to [[Companies House]] records, Banks has set up 37 different companies using slight variations of his name. The names used by Banks are Aron Fraser Andrew Banks, Arron Andrew Fraser Banks, Arron Fraser Andrew Banks and Arron Banks. The profiles for the first three names all use the same date of birth but register different lists of companies. When asked by ''The Guardian'' about this, he declined to answer questions on the topic.&lt;ref name=Syal&gt;{{cite news |last=Syal |first=Rajeev |title=Ukip donor Arron Banks shows tax cheque sent to HMRC for £1.86m |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/04/ukip-donor-arron-banks-shows-tax-cheque-sent-hmrc|work=The Guardian |date=4 October 2014 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks also owns [[Eldon Insurance]], whose CEO Elizabeth Bilney was also in charge at Leave.EU, and where [[Andy Wigmore]] is also a director. The company's profits leapt to £16.7m for the first half of 2017 after recording a £284,000 profit in 2015 and a loss of £22,500 in 2016 despite a 40% increase in revenue. Banks said that Eldon's business had been transformed by the same [[AI]] technology used in the Brexit campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Revenue jumps at UKIP donor Arron Banks insurance business Eldon |url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/revenue-ukip-donor-arron-banks-insurance-business-eldon-2017-10 |work=Business Insider |date=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Offshore investment|offshore]] [[holding company]] that controls Eldon Insurance is ICS Risk Solutions, which funds many of Banks' activities and has paid over £77m between 2015 and 2018 to prop up Southern Rock after Gibraltarian regulators found the business to be trading while technically insolvent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=MPs call for police to investigate Arron Banks' links to Russia |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/10/arron-banks-mps-call-for-police-investigate-russia-links |work=The Guardian |date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of an agreement with the regulators Banks resigned his directorships at Eldon in 2013 and Southern Rock in 2014, also accepting a "period of ban or self-exclusion from other insurance directorships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Cynthia O'Murchu |author2=Henry Mance |title=How the businesses of Brexit campaigner ‘King’ Arron Banks overlap |url=https://www.ft.com/content/8cddfeea-5c02-11e7-b553-e2df1b0c3220 |work=The Economist|date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also bought Old Down Manor from musician [[Mike Oldfield]], converting it into a wedding venue.&lt;ref name="New Statesman 2016-10-13"/&gt;

In 2016, the leaked [[Panama Papers]] indicated Banks along with Elizabeth Bilney were shareholders of [[British Virgin Islands]] company PRI Holdings Limited, which was the sole shareholder of African Strategic Resources Limited.&lt;ref name="guardian-20160404"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/04/tory-donors-links-to-offshore-firms-revealed-in-leaked-panama-papers |title=Tory donors' links to offshore firms revealed in leaked Panama Papers |author=Holly Watt |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 April 2016 |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a spokesperson for Banks has denied any links to the lawyer named and denies that Banks was involved with the Papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bristol millionaire and Ukip donor Arron Banks denies being in controversial Panama Papers |url= http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/8203-Bristol-millionaire-Ukip-donor-Arron-Banks/story-29057299-detail/story.html |accessdate=1 June 2016|newspaper=[[Bristol Post]]|date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks has stated that he has a controlling interest in a diamond mine in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], South Africa, and a licence to mine in [[Lesotho]].&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-20141002"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/02/ukip-donor-belize-mining-southern-africa |title=Ukip donor has links to Belize and mining in southern Africa |author=Rajeev Syal, Rebecca Davi |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2 October 2014 |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, Banks denied that money paid to a government minister in Lesotho was a bribe; it had been paid to guarantee diamond mining rights in Lesotho. In 2013, Banks paid £65,000 into the private bank account of Thesebe Maseribane, then the Basotho minister for women's equality. Banks subsequently covered the £350,000 costs of a political campaign for Maseribane, in 2014, following a military coup in Lesotho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rawlinson, Kevin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/25/arron-banks-denies-payment-to-african-minister-was-a-bribe |title=Arron Banks denies payment to Lesotho minister was a bribe |work=The Guardian |date=25 July 2018 |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, one estimate of his wealth was £100 million.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; In November 2017, an estimate of £250 million was mentioned.&lt;ref name="veconomist" &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Arron Banks, bankroller of Brexit, faces investigation over his donations |url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21730890-claims-russian-influence-are-complete-bollocks-he-insists-arron-banks-bankroller-Brexit |work=[[The Economist]] |date=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following intensified media scrutiny after his initial donation to UKIP, it emerged that Banks was involved in mining in southern Africa and had connections to [[Belize]]. Banks also has connections to companies based in [[Gibraltar]] and the [[Isle of Man]], and close connections with family members of the Belizean Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="Syal2014" /&gt; However, following remarks made by ''[[The Thick of It]]'' creator [[Armando Iannucci]] on [[BBC One]]'s [[Question Time (TV series)|''Question Time'']] programme, Banks denied owning a company in Belize or seeking to avoid UK tax "via any device". Describing the comments as "clearly defamatory", he threatened legal action towards Iannucci if he did not get an apology within a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mason|first1=Chris|title=Armando Iannucci tax claim sparks UKIP donor legal threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-31463868|accessdate=1 June 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2015|03|01|reason=If we cannot state whether he followed up on the threat, we should remove this statement.

Asked if his companies paid full corporation tax, Banks said: "I paid over £2.5m of income tax last year ... My insurance business, like a lot of them, is based in Gibraltar but I've got UK businesses as well that deal with customers and pay tax like everyone else."&lt;ref name="Syal2014" /&gt; One of the UK businesses of which Banks is director, Rock Services Ltd, had a turnover of £19.7m in 2013 and paid corporation tax of £12,000. The company deducted £19.6m in "administrative expenses", and the main activity appears to be "recharge of goods and services" with Southern Rock Insurance Company.&lt;ref name="Syal2014" /&gt; Southern Rock Insurance states on its website that it underwrites policies for the customers of GoSkippy.com, which is run by Banks.

Rock Services and Southern Rock Insurance's ultimate holding company is Rock Holdings Ltd, a company based on the Isle of Man.&lt;ref name="Syal2014" /&gt; Banks has also been a "substantial" shareholder in STM Fidecs, of which Leave.EU is a subsidiary; the company claims to be specialising in "international wealth protection", maximising tax efficiencies for entrepreneurs and expatriates and of "structuring international groups, particularly separating and relocating intellectual property and treasury functions to low- or no-tax jurisdictions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boffey|first1=Daniel|title=Tax-avoidance Gibraltar firm behind anti-EU campaign group|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/07/referendum-farage-leave-eu|accessdate=1 June 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career and donations==
Banks was previously a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] donor but in October 2014 stated that he {{Citation needed span|date=November 2018|text=had donated}} £100,000 to UKIP. In response to denials from Prime Minister David Cameron that he had been a large Conservative donor in past years, Banks increased the donation to £1 million to the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP), directly referencing David Cameron's previous interview as his reasoning. Banks said that he had changed party allegiance because he agrees with UKIP's policies and its view that the [[European Union]] "is holding the UK back" because it's a "[[closed shop]] for bankrupt countries".&lt;ref name=BBCUKIP&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Tory donor Arron Banks gives £1m to UKIP|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29438653|accessdate=1 June 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BPUKIP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bristol businessman ups UKIP donation to £1 million after Tory calls him a "nobody"|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bristol-businessman-ups-UKIP-donation-1-million/story-23027035-detail/story.html|accessdate=1 June 2016|newspaper=Bristol Post|date=1 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124041111/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bristol-businessman-ups-UKIP-donation-1-million/story-23027035-detail/story.html#|archive-date=24 January 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks has been described as the "leading figure" behind the anti-EU [[Grassroots Out]] and [[Leave.EU]],&lt;ref name="Wright2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=Oliver|title=Leave.EU group accused of avoiding strict rules on campaign spending|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-referendum-leaveeu-group-accused-of-avoiding-strict-rules-on-campaign-spending-a6984941.html|accessdate=1 June 2016|newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the official [[Vote Leave]] campaign.&lt;ref name="PEye1411"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sceptic Cranks |newspaper=[[Private Eye]] |issue=1411 |date=5 February 2016|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PEye1415&gt;{{cite news |title=Rock &amp; high rollers |url= http://www.private-eye.co.uk/issue-1415/hp-sauce |accessdate=1 June 2016 |newspaper=Private Eye |issue=1415|date=1 April 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160417012144/http://www.private-eye.co.uk/issue-1415/hp-sauce |deadurl=yes |archivedate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He signalled his intention to stand for UKIP in the constituency of [[Thornbury and Yate (UK Parliament constituency)|Thornbury and Yate]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Go Skippy founder Arron Banks to stand as UKIP MP |url= http://www.insurancetimes.co.uk/go-skippy-founder-arron-banks-to-stand-as-ukip-mp/1410163.article |publisher=Insurance Times|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the candidate chosen by the party was Russ Martin, who came third. He indicated he would stand in [[Clacton (UK Parliament constituency)|Clacton]] at the 2017 general election against [[Douglas Carswell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39114851|title=UKIP: Arron Banks may stand against Douglas Carswell|date=28 February 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=28 February 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later decided otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Ukip donor Arron Banks pulls out of election race in Clacton after Douglas Carswell steps down | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/ukip-donor-arron-banks-pulls-10288269 |date=25 April 2017|access-date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Banks claimed in March 2017 that he had been suspended from UKIP; he believed the reason was that he had criticised the leadership. UKIP said, however, that his membership had lapsed before this time.&lt;ref name=laura/&gt;

In May 2018, Banks attended a fundraising event for the [[Democratic Unionist Party]], alongside [[Nigel Farage]], and stated that he would support a bid by Farage to seek office as a DUP candidate after the end of his tenure as [[Member of the European Parliament]] in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Times]]|date=13 May 2018|title=Nigel Farage’s Ukip backer Arron Banks bolsters his DUP bid|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/nigel-farages-ukip-backer-arron-banks-bolsters-his-dup-bid-gvz8wqvnt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, it was reported that Banks had applied to join the Conservative Party and had suggested that Leave.EU supporters do the same, with the aim of voting in the party's next leadership election. According to the report, [[Andy Wigmore]], Leave.EU's communications director, who had also applied to join the party, announced that they had received an email welcoming them, but the Conservative Party stated that their applications had not been approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45290206|website=BBC News |title=Leave.EU's Arron Banks denied Conservative membership |date=23 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Conservative Party spokesman said that welcoming emails were automatic but applications were subsequently reviewed, and theirs had been rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/23/tories-say-they-rejected-arron-banks-bid-to-join-party |work=The Guardian |title=Tories say Arron Banks' bid to join party has been rejected |date=23 August 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservative Party donations===
A spokesman for [[Nigel Farage]] said that Banks had funded the [[Chipping Sodbury]] office for the [[South Gloucestershire]] Conservatives "to the tune of £250,000". However, a Conservative spokesperson said the support was "nothing like the order of magnitude" of sums claimed, and estimated that the donations were "probably around the £22,000 mark".&lt;ref name="hague"/&gt;

A UKIP source told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that Banks had also loaned £75,417 to [[Thornbury and Yate]] Conservative Party through Panacea Finance (his former company) in September 2007, registered on the [[Electoral Commission]] and to be paid back by 2022. However, [[Companies House]] records show that Banks resigned from the company in September 2005; therefore it was considered questionable as to whether Banks was controlling the company at the time, or whether he was "using the firm as a 'proxy donor'", according to ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref name=Syal /&gt;

==Relationship with Eurosceptic organisations==
In October 2014, Banks donated £1 million to the [[UK Independence Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ex-Tory donor Arron Banks gives £1m to UKIP |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29438653 |publisher=BBC News |date=1 October 2014 |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since raised the equivalent of $11 million for the party. He has also funded [[Leave.EU]] by the equivalent of $5 million, and has been seen as the financial backer of the [[Brexit]] campaign.&lt;ref name="Erlanger-Freytas-tamura"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Erlanger|first1=Steven|last2=Freytas-tamura|first2=Kimiko De|title=Godfather of ‘Brexit’ Takes Aim at the British Establishment|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/world/europe/arron-banks-brexit-britain.html|work=The New York Times|date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative MP [[William Hague]] called Banks "somebody we haven't heard of" following his defection to UKIP: In response, Banks increased his donation from £100,000 to £1 million, saying: "I woke up this morning intending to give £100,000 to UKIP - then I heard Mr Hague's comment about me being a Mr Nobody. So in light of that I have decided to give £1 million."&lt;ref name="BPUKIP" /&gt; This donation was one of the largest sums of money ever received by UKIP.&lt;ref name="Syal2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Syal|first1=Rajeev|title=Ukip donor has links to Belize and mining in southern Africa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/02/ukip-donor-belize-mining-southern-africa|accessdate=1 June 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks threatened [[Douglas Carswell]] with [[Preselection|deselection]] in September 2015 when it emerged that Carswell supported [[Vote Leave]], as opposed to the [[Leave.EU]] campaign funded by Banks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCann|first1=Kate|title=Ukip donor threatens Douglas Carswell with deselection|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/11891613/Ukip-donor-threatens-Douglas-Carswell-with-deselection.html|accessdate=1 June 2016|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing Carswell as "borderline autistic with mental illness wrapped in", according to ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bennett|first1=Owen|title='Douglas Carswell Is Borderline Autistic With Mental Illness Wrapped In,' says Ukip Donor Arron Banks |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/25/douglas-carswell-arron-banks-ukip_n_8196782.html |accessdate=1 June 2016|work=The Huffington Post|date=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, ''[[Private Eye]]'' reported that [[Leave.EU]] "is registered at Companies House as Better for the Country Ltd. and controlled by major UKIP donor Arron Banks, after [[Economy of Gibraltar#Finance|Gibraltar company]] STM Fidecs Nominees Ltd. transferred its interest to him in August."&lt;ref name=PEye1415 /&gt; Banks, along with property investor Richard Tice and media guru [[Andrew Wigmore]], donated £4.3m to the group.&lt;ref name=PEye1415 /&gt;

Banks credits the success of Leave.EU to their hiring of Goddard Gunster and their subsequent adoption of "an American-style media approach".  Banks said, "What [Goddard Gunster] said early on was 'facts don’t work' and that's it. The remain campaign featured fact, fact, fact, fact, fact. It just doesn’t work. You have got to connect with people emotionally. It’s the [[Donald Trump|Trump]] success."&lt;ref name=GuardianFacts&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/29/leave-donor-plans-new-party-to-replace-ukip-without-farage |title=Leave donor plans new party to replace Ukip – possibly without Farage in charge |author1=Robert Booth |author2=Alan Travis |author3=Amelia Gentleman |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 June 2016 |accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2017, Labour MP [[Ben Bradshaw]] called for an inquiry into Banks' funding of the Leave campaign over concerns of foreign interference in it.&lt;ref name=mpcalls&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/19/mp-calls-for-inquiry-into-arron-banks-and-dark-money-in-eu-referendum|title=MP calls for inquiry into Arron Banks and 'dark money' in EU referendum|last=Harding|first=Luke|date=19 October 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=19 October 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possibility of "rightwing Momentum"===
In September 2016, following Banks' statement that UKIP would be "dead in the water" if [[Diane James]] did not become leader,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/ukip-diane-james-arron-banks_uk_57d9755ee4b00f7417356350|title=Ukip Is ‘Dead In The Water’ If Diane James Doesn’t Become Leader, Says Party Donor Arron Banks|work=Huffington Post|author=Owen Bennett|date=15 September 2016|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he said that he would leave UKIP if [[Steven Woolfe]] was prevented from running for leader and two other senior members remained in the party: "If [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] and [[Douglas Carswell]] [UKIP's only MP] remain in the party, and the NEC decide that Steven Woolfe cannot run for leader, I will be leaving Ukip".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/arron-banks-ukip-neil-hamilton-douglas-carswell-donor-a7349576.html|title=Arron Banks threatens to leave Ukip after being 'utterly disgusted' by party member's remarks following altercation|work=The Independent|author=May Bulman|date=6 October 2016|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Banks was sceptical of UKIP under the leadership of [[Paul Nuttall]].&lt;ref name="Booth-Cobain-Guard1.a"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Booth|first1=Robert|last2=Cobain|first2=Ian|title=Ukip donor Arron Banks hints he may stop supporting party|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/05/ukip-donor-arron-banks-hints-he-may-stop-supporting-party|work=The Guardian|date=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks said that Leave.EU would continue campaigning as a "rightwing [[Momentum (organisation)|Momentum]]", ensuring that politicians do not renege on their commitment to leave the EU.&lt;ref name=GuardianFacts /&gt; Banks has also considered starting and funding a pro-Brexit, nonpartisan citizens' movement called Patriotic Alliance, based on the [[Five Star Movement]],&lt;ref name="Erlanger-Freytas-tamura" /&gt; which would target "the 200 worst, most corrupt MPs" for deselection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coates|first1=Sam|title=Tycoon wants to smash Commons political careerists|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tycoon-wants-to-smash-commons-political-careerists-96k5dmbgx|work=The Times|date=14 November 2016|language=en|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brexit==

Banks said that Britain's EU membership "is like having a first class ticket on the [[Titanic]]". He also said that "Economically, remaining in the EU is unsustainable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dearden |first1=Lizzie |title=Millionaire Tory donor defects to Ukip |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/millionaire-tory-donor-arron-banks-defects-to-ukip-with-100000-donation-9766314.html |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=1 June 2016|date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riley-Smith|first1=Ben|title=Tory donor defects to Ukip |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/11132737/Tory-donor-defects-to-Ukip.html |accessdate=1 June 2016 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks said in May 2016 that his strategy during the Brexit campaign was to "bore the electorate into submission", in the hope that a low turnout would favour Brexit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Helm|first1=Toby|last2=Ratcliffe|first2=Rebecca|title=Youth vote targeted for registration before EU referendum|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/14/eu-referendum-youth-vote-registration-countdown|accessdate=28 June 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=Oliver|title=The head of the campaign to leave the EU wants to privatise the NHS|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/anti-eu-leave-campaign-chief-arron-banks-nhs-privatised-a7022306.html|accessdate=28 June 2016|newspaper=The Independent|date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Vote Leave#Relationship with other groups}}
Banks threatened to sue the official [[Vote Leave]] campaign's candidacy as the official spokesperson for the "Leave" vote in the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 EU referendum]], which may have possibly delayed the vote by two months. However, Banks has since rejected this and stated that he would not pursue a judicial review any further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mason|first1=Rowena|title=Nigel Farage calls for end to Brexit campaign infighting|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/14/nigel-farage-calls-for-end-to-brexit-campaign-infighting|accessdate=8 June 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks has also claimed that Vote Leave were deliberately lying when they claimed that the UK sends £350 million to the European Union, claiming this does not take into consideration the [[UK rebate|rebate which the UK receives]] from the EU, and that the £350 million is not actually sent to the EU headquarters in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCann|first1=Kate|title=EU debate: Michael Gove condemns 'job-destroying' elites and 'racist' immigration rules as he appeals to Britons to back 'Project Hope' |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/03/eu-debate-michael-gove-faces-biggest-test-of-campaign-as-he-take1/|accessdate=8 June 2016 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the murder of [[Jo Cox]], Arron Banks commissioned a poll on whether her murder had affected public opinion on voting. Asked whether the wording of the poll was "tasteless", Banks said "I don't think so",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigel Farage: PM trying to link Jo Cox killing to Brexit campaign|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36574254|accessdate=28 June 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding that: "We were hoping to see what the effect of the event was.

In August 2017, Banks wrote to all voters in [[Philip Hammond]]'s constituency, seeking support for a move to deselect Hammond. In response to a constituent's email, Hammond said "others will disagree with my views and someone with opposing views to mine can always stand for election against me... I challenge Mr Banks to do so".{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Post-referendum events===
Following Britain's vote to leave the EU, Banks emailed a note to journalists attacking his critics. Banks described the United Kingdom's parliamentary [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] as "the legal division of the In campaign" and disagreed with their decision to enlist Vote Leave as the official campaign. Banks' response to the information commissioner, who in 2016 fined the campaign £50,000 for sending more than half a million unsolicited text messages, was a succinct "Whatever".&lt;ref name="Ross2016a"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Alice|title=Leave.EU co-chair Arron Banks takes swipe at critics after Brexit victory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/27/leave-eu-arron-banks-swipe-at-critics-brexit-victory|accessdate=28 June 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cork2016a"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cork|first1=Tristan|title=Leave.EU and Arron Banks issue unbelievable press release 'apologising' to their critics|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/bite-me-arron-banks-astonishing-put-down-to-leave-eu-critics/story-29449144-detail/story.html|accessdate=28 June 2016|newspaper=Bristol Post|date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks views the Brexit vote as "a kind of halfhearted revolution" due to the fact that [[Theresa May]], who supported Britain remaining in the EU, would end up betraying those who voted to leave.&lt;ref name="Erlanger-Freytas-tamura" /&gt;

In November 2017, the Electoral Commission announced that it is investigating whether election rules were broken during the EU referendum, in donations worth a total of £8.4 million to Leave.EU campaigners made by Banks and by Better for the Country Ltd, a company of which Banks is a registered director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41829107|work=[[BBC News]]|date=1 November 2017|title=Arron Banks faces EU referendum finance investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8d532c46-beff-11e7-b8a3-38a6e068f464|work=[[Financial Times]]|title=Arron Banks under investigation over Brexit campaign spending|date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 2018, regarding the Leave result in the Brexit referendum, Banks said on ''[[The Andrew Marr Show]]'': "The corruption I've seen in British politics, the sewer that exists and the disgraceful behaviour of the government over what they're doing with Brexit and how they're selling it out - means if I had my time again I think we would probably have been better to vote Remain and not unleash these demons."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.sky.com/story/live-number-10-dismisses-secret-brexit-deal-talk-11544522 'No Russian money', says Brexit campaign funder] ''Sky News''. 4 November 2018.

From September 2015, Banks, along with [[Andy Wigmore]], had multiple meetings with Russian officials posted at the Russian embassy in London.&lt;ref name="nytoffered" /&gt; In November 2015, [[Alexander Vladimirovich Yakovenko|Alexander Yakovenko]], the Russian ambassador, introduced Banks to a Russian businessman, which was followed by other business proposals on the part of Russians.&lt;ref name="guardmultiple"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/09/arron-banks-russia-brexit-meeting |title=Arron Banks 'met Russian officials multiple times before Brexit vote' |first=Carole |last=Cadwalladr |date=9 June 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=10 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/10/arron-banks-mps-call-for-police-investigate-russia-links |title=MPs call for police to investigate Arron Banks' links to Russia |work=The Guardian |date=10 June 2018 |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Banks was offered a chance to invest in Russian-owned gold or diamond mines; the deal involved funding from a Russian state-owned bank, and was announced 12 days after the Brexit referendum.&lt;ref name="nytoffered"&gt;{{cite news|author1=David D.

For two years, Banks said his only contacts with the Russian government consisted of one "boozy lunch" with the ambassador. After ''[[The Observer]]'' reported that he had had multiple meetings at which he had been offered lucrative business deals, Banks told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news he had had "two or three" meetings. In July 2018 when pressed by ''[[The New York Times]]'', he said there had been a fourth meeting. ''The Observer'' has seen evidence that suggests his Leave.EU campaign team met with Russian embassy officials as many as 11 times in the run-up to the EU referendum and in the two months beyond.&lt;ref name="theguardian1"/&gt;

It has been reported that on 12 November 2016, Arron Banks had a meeting with president-elect [[Donald Trump]] in Trump Tower and that upon return to London, Banks had lunch with the Russian ambassador where they discussed the Trump visit.&lt;ref name="nytoffered" /&gt;

==Websites==
===LibLabCon.com===
Banks gave significant funds to LibLabCon.com, a [[satirical]] website dedicated to attacking the three major parties. The website included jokes about the treatment of religious people by the Conservatives, claimed [[Chuka Umunna]] is "Labour's chief spokesman for [[tokenism]]" and described [[Amnesty International]] as an organisation which supports "loudmouth idiots chained to a radiator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pitel|first1=Laura|title=Farage ally backs blog that mocks main parties |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4306254.ece |accessdate=1 June 2016 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=24 December 2014 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; UKIP sources said that Banks did not write the material on the website. Despite receiving the support of Banks and [[Tim Aker]], UKIP told the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' the website was not linked to them.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Westmonster===

On 19 January 2017 (one day before [[Donald Trump's inauguration]] as the [[45th President of the United States]]) Banks launched Westmonster alongside Michael Heaver, former press adviser to [[Nigel Farage]].&lt;ref name="Rajan-18Jan17a"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rajan|first1=Amol|title=Arron Banks launches anti-establishment website|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38650596|work=BBC News|date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson-19Jan17a"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jackson|first1=Jasper|title=Arron Banks launches Breitbart-style site Westmonster|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/19/arron-banks-launches-breitbart-style-site-westmonster|work=The Guardian|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is modelled on the right-wing US websites [[Breitbart News]] and the [[Drudge Report]] and claims to be "pro-Brexit, pro-Farage, pro-Trump, anti-establishment, anti-open borders, anti-corporatism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Westmonster: Arron Banks launches 'anti-establishment' website|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/80681/westmonster-arron-banks-launches-anti-establishment-website|work=The Week UK|date=19 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rettman|first1=Andrew|title=Brexit men launch anti-EU website|url=https://euobserver.com/uk-referendum/136603|work=EU Observer|date=19 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks believes that Leave.EU's 800,000 [[Twitter]] followers will drive traffic towards the website.&lt;ref name="Jackson-19Jan17a" /&gt; In the morning of 19 January, Westmonster's Twitter account had gained more than 2,500 followers.&lt;ref name="Bulman-19Jan2017a"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bulman|first1=May|title=Multimillionaire who funded Brexit campaign has launched a website to take on 'the establishment'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/arron-banks-ukip-donor-leave-eu-founder-launches-westmonster-ant-establsihment-populist-nigel-farage-a7534656.html|work=The Independent|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Owners====
Westmonster is co-owned by Arron Banks and Michael Heaver, former press adviser to [[Nigel Farage]].&lt;ref name="Rajan-18Jan17a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson-19Jan17a"/&gt;

The official registered owners of the site are Heaver, who owns 50% of the website and is a daily editor,&lt;ref name="Rajan-18Jan17a" /&gt; and Better for the Country Ltd. Better for the Country Ltd is the company that ran [[Leave.EU]] (one of two main pro-Brexit campaigns, affiliated to Farage) and is directed by Leave.EU's chief executive, Elizabeth Bilney. Better for the Country Ltd is also registered to the same address as Westmonster. 

====Early contributors and style====
Westmonster's welcome message stated that the political establishment had "taken one hell of a beating" in 2016, adding that "2017 might just be even bigger".&lt;ref name="Bulman-19Jan2017a" /&gt; The timing of this launch was seen as sign that the anti-establishment media which helped Trump to gain power was arriving in the UK, according to [[BBC News]]' media editor [[Amol Rajan]].&lt;ref name="Rajan-18Jan17a" /&gt;

Although primarily a [[news aggregator]] website akin to the ''[[Drudge Report]]'', Westmonster does plan to publish original content&lt;ref name="Rajan-18Jan17a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson-19Jan17a" /&gt; and enlist the support of celebrities and backbench MPs.&lt;ref name="Bulman-19Jan2017a" /&gt; Early contributions to the website include a piece written by [[Nigel Farage]] stating that the "political establishment" of the United Kingdom had not woken up to European [[populist]] movements, as well as articles showing majority British support for a [[burka ban]] and attacking "remoaners" for "trying to subvert the will of the people".&lt;ref name="Bulman-19Jan2017a" /&gt;

'''Arturo José Cruz Porras''' (December 18, 1923 – July 9, 2013), sometimes called '''Arturo Cruz, Sr.''' to distinguish him from his [[Arturo Cruz, Jr.|son]], was a [[Nicaragua]]n banker and technocrat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers |first=Tim |url=http://www.nicaraguadispatch.com/news/2013/07/arturo-cruz-porras-dies-at-89/8142 |title=Arturo Cruz Porras dies at 89 |publisher=Nicaraguadispatch.com |date=2013-07-04 |accessdate=2013-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became prominent in politics during the [[Sandinista]] (FSLN) era. After repeatedly resigning from positions in protest, opinion divided between those who lauded him as a statesman and man of principle, and those who derided him as an ineffectual hand-wringer.

==Somoza opponent==
Cruz grew up in [[Jinotepe]], [[Nicaragua]]. His father despised [[Anastasio Somoza García]], despite the family's traditional Liberal loyalties. Cruz graduated from the military academy in 1944, but refused his commission rather than serve Somoza's dictatorship. He went on to attend [[Georgetown University]] in the [[United States]]. Cruz participated in a 1947 coup plot against Somoza, for which he was imprisoned for four months. After joining the April Rebellion of 1954, together with his brother-in-law, Adolfo Báez Bone, and [[Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal]], he was jailed again for about a year,&lt;ref&gt;Cruz, Jr.: 34 says fourteen months, but Kinzer:224 and another source says eleven months.&lt;/ref&gt; while Báez was executed. However, his wife persuaded him not to join Edmundo and [[Fernando "El Negro" Chamorro]] in their November 1960 rising, which included an attack on the Jinotepe barracks. He would avoid rebel politics for nearly two decades.

In 1969, Cruz became an official at the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. There, he was approached by the FSLN in 1977. He became a member of ''[[Los Doce]]'', the Group of Twelve establishment figures who voiced support for the [[Sandinista]] struggle against dictator [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]]. Their backing of the Sandinistas' [[popular front]] convinced many Nicaraguans that the FSLN's appeal had broadened beyond its [[communist]] roots, and moved the country towards the full-scale [[insurrection]] that toppled the régime in July 1979.

==Sandinista opponent==
Cruz was appointed head of the Central Bank in post-Somoza Nicaragua. When the non-[[communist]] moderates resigned from the [[Junta of National Reconstruction]] in April 1980, after finding that the real power lay with the FSLN National Directorate, he joined the Junta as a replacement moderate on May 18. He too became frustrated with his impotence, but agreed to leave gracefully by becoming ambassador to the United States. The arrangement was announced on March 4, 1981.

Cruz continued to clash with Sandinista policies, and resigned as ambassador in November 1981, returning to the IADB. However, he was a major ghostwriter for the speech delivered by Sandinista hero [[Edén Pastora]] at his press conference of April 15, 1982, in which Pastora declared his break with the FSLN National Directorate. Pastora's speech helped convince his son, [[Arturo Cruz, Jr.]], who was not then aware of his father's role, to also move from supporting the Sandinistas to joining Pastora's camp.

When the Sandinistas announced in January 1984 that they would hold elections in November, the right-wing opposition umbrella group, the [[Coordinadora Democrática Nicaragüense]], settled on Cruz as the only candidate acceptable to all factions. However, in the end he [[election boycott|boycotted the election]], saying it would not be free and fair. Years later he admitted that his decision not to run was a mistake and that he was on the payroll of the [[CIA]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|title=New York Times|date=8 Jan 1988}} quoted in {{citation|title=The fall and rise of the market in Sandinista Nicaragua|author=Phil Ryan|year=1995|publisher=Canada, McGill-Queens University Press|page=153}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, Cruz drifted deeper into the politics of the rebel [[Contras]]. He was a primary drafter of the San José Declaration of March 1, 1985, signed by many rebel leaders. The declaration evolved into the formation of the rebel umbrella group [[United Nicaraguan Opposition]] (UNO) on June 12, with [[Alfonso Robelo]] and the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]]'s [[Adolfo Calero]]. However, with Calero's FDN comprising the great majority of UNO's forces, he found himself in another figurehead position. He continually threatened to resign unless he and Robelo were given real power. Despite Calero's eventual resignation in February 1987, he quit anyway on March 9.

In 1999, he issued a statement asking the United States and Honduran governments to release all information about the death of his nephew, David Arturo Báez Cruz, a naturalized American citizen and former [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] who returned to Nicaragua to serve in Sandinista military intelligence, and died while acting as a [[military advisor]] with Honduran [[guerrilla]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3556">'''Benjamin ben Immanuel Musaphia''' (c. 1606 – 1675), also called '''Benjamin Musaphia''' or '''Mussafia''' and '''Dionysius''', was a Jewish doctor, scholar and [[Kabbalah|kabbalist]].

Musaphia was probably born in [[Spain]].  He married Sara Abigail da Silva, daughter of Semuel da Silva, in 1628. Their sons and grandsons joined the court of the [[Duke of Holstein-Gottorp|Gottorp]]s, and a daughter was married to [[Gabriel Milan]], who would later be appointed governor of the Danish West-Indies (now [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]). Around this time, Musaphia graduated from the [[University of Padua|Padua]] medical school, which was regarded as the best of its kind at the time.

== Publications ==
After Sara's death on August 7, 1634, Musaphia dedicated ''[[Zekher Rav]]'', an adaptation of the [[creation myth]] in which all [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word roots are used exactly once, to her. It was first published in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]], in 1635, and a second edition with a [[Latin]] translation was published in [[Hamburg]] in 1638.

Another work was published in 1640, namely ''[[Sacro-Medicæ Sententiæ ex Bibliis]]'', a medical treatise containing about 800 sentences on medicine. It contained a section on [[alchemy]] that created some stirring at the time. Musaphia also dedicated a work on ebb and flow to [[Christian IV of Denmark]] in 1642.

== Career ==
In 1646, while living in [[Glückstadt]], [[Holstein]], Musaphia was appointed royal physician to the Danish court by Christian IV.

Around 1648, probably in connection with the death of Christian IV, Musaphia went to Amsterdam and joined the college of rabbis. In 1655, he published an extended version of [[Nathan ben Jehiel]]s [[Talmud]]ic dictionary ''Aruk'' (ca. 1100), titled ''Musaf he-'Aruk'', detailing many Jewish customs. The preface states that he had been collecting this information since a young boy. Musaphia was also working on a revised version of the Talmud, which was nevertheless never published, and the manuscripts have since been lost.

== Personal life and family ==
In the mid-1660s, Musaphia was caught up in the [[Sabbateans]] movement, which proclaimed that [[Sabbatai Zevi]] was the new Messiah.

His brother Albert Dionis was one of the wealthiest Jews in Hamburg in 1614.&lt;ref&gt;Terslin, Milan, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Musaphia died in 1675, in Amsterdam.

'''Biuku Gasa''' (27 July 1923 – 23 November 2005) and '''Eroni Kumana''' (c. 1918&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyti.ms/1oZSxyN]
"Eroni Kumana, Who Saved Kennedy and His Shipwrecked Crew, Dies at 96"&lt;/ref&gt; – 2 August 2014) were [[Solomon Islands|Solomon Islanders]] of [[Melanesian]] descent, who found [[John F. Kennedy]] and his surviving  [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|''PT-109'']] crew following the boat's collision with the [[Japanese destroyer Amagiri (1930)|Japanese destroyer ''Amagiri'']] near [[Kennedy Island|Plum Pudding Island]] on 1 August 1943. They were from the [[Western Province (Solomon Islands)|Western Province]] of the Solomon Islands.

==''PT-109'' search and rescue==
During [[World War II]], Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana were tasked with patrolling the waters of the [[Solomon Sea]] near [[Gizo, Solomon Islands|Gizo]] with Australian [[Coastwatchers|coastwatcher]] [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Arthur Reginald Evans]], who manned a secret observation post at the top of [[Kolombangara]] island's [[Mount Veve]] volcano. Evans had spotted an explosion on 1 August, and later decoded news that the explosion he had witnessed was probably from the lost ''PT-109''. On 2 August Gasa and Kumana were dispatched by Evans to search in their [[Dugout (boat)|dugout canoe]] for possible ''PT-109'' survivors. Abandoning their sinking ship, Kennedy and his men swam first to the very tiny Plum Pudding island.  

They later abandoned Plum Pudding Island and swam to tiny Olasana Island in search of food and water.  On Olsana, Kennedy found coconuts and fresh water which were of some small help to his men.  On Olsana Island, Kennedy was discovered by the two islander men. The canoe couldn't accommodate all of the PT-109 crewmen safely, and the islanders and English-speaking crew had difficulty communicating with each other. In absence of writing utensils, Biuku Gasa suggested that Kennedy should inscribe a message on the husk of a coconut he had plucked from a nearby palm tree. This carved message, after rowing their dugout canoe at great risk through {{convert|35|nmi|km|abbr=on}} of hostile waters patrolled by the Japanese,  was then delivered to the nearest Allied base at [[Rendova]]. They enabled the ensuing return to Olasana and the successful American rescue operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.americanwarriorsfivepresidents.com |title=American Warriors: Five Presidents in the Pacific Theater of World War II |publisher=Burd Street Press |year=2003 |isbn=1-57249-260-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Kennedy later invited Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana to attend his [[Inauguration of John F. Kennedy|presidential inauguration]] in 1961, but the pair was duped en route in [[Honiara]], the Solomon Islands capital, by British colonial officials who sent other representatives instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,503050815-1091374,00.html |title=A Friend in Deed |publisher=TIME Magazine |first=Tom |last=Dusevic |date=8 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another version of the story is that they were turned back by British officials at the airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/11/1120_021120_kennedy_pt_109_2.html |title=JFK's Island Rescuers Honored at Emotional Reunion |publisher=National Geographic |first=Ted |last=Chamberlain |date=20 November 2002 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  story from Biuku's descendants is that the British officials did not want to send Biuku and Eroni because they were simple village men and not well dressed (by the British authorities' standards). This was a sad outcome for two men who were as much war heroes as those they helped rescue{{According to whom|date=July 2018}}. They were volunteers who willingly helped U.S. forces with disregard to their own safety or wellbeing, and who knew full well what the retributions would have been if they had been discovered by the Japanese. The legend of these two men survives to this day among their descendants in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands. [[File:GuadCoastwatcher.gif|250px|thumb|right|Captain Martin Clemens, Australian Coastwatcher on Guadalcanal, rendered services to Allied forces during the battle for the island (August 1942-February 1943). These natives were all members of the Solomon Islands police force.  Lt. [[Arthur Reginald Evans]] and his scouts would have appeared in similar uniform]]

===Recognition===

Another scout, Alesasa Bisili, wrote of his experience during the 1942 Japanese landing at Munda in ''Scouting in Western Solomons''. He expressed sadness and anger over the unjust lack of recognition or award given to Solomon Islanders for their services during the war.

However, in recognition of his help, Biuku Gasa lived in a house paid for by the Kennedy family ($5k), National Geographic ($5k) and the balance ($15k) by Brian and Sue Mitchell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3107103.stm |title=JFK's epic Solomon's swim |publisher=BBC News |date=30 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC reference that the Kennedy family paid for the entire house is incorrect. The house was designed by Brian Mitchell in co-operation with a Brisbane-based Australian architect.  Melody Miller, Senator [[Edward Kennedy]]'s Press Secretary, was responsible for pulling all the parties together after being approached by Brian and Sue Mitchell. The Kennedys also constructed a house for Eroni Kumana. It fell down in the 2007 tsunami, but Kumana survived the storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swimforgizo.oceanswims.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811104022/http://www.swimforgizo.oceanswims.com/ |archivedate=11 August 2007 |title=shake shake swim for gizo |publisher=oceanswims}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gasa and Kumana were interviewed by ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'' in 2002, and can be seen on the DVD of the television special. They were presented a bust by [[Max Kennedy]], a son of [[Robert Kennedy]]. The ''National Geographic'' had gone there as part of an expedition by [[Robert Ballard]], the discoverer of the wreck of the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'', who did find the remains of the PT-109. The special was called ''[[The Search for Kennedy's PT 109]]''.&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/07/0709_020710_kennedyPT109.html "JFK's PT-109 Found, U.S. Navy Confirms"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a swim was organized to raise money for Biuku Gasa's community.

== Lives ==
Biuku Gasa was born 27 July 1923, in Madou, Solomon Islands, and lived in Vavudu Village, Kauvi Island, in the Western Solomons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pt109swim.com/The%20Results.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515045740/http://www.pt109swim.com/The%20Results.htm |archivedate=15 May 2008 |title=The 2003 Results |publisher=PT109 Commemorative Swim Marathon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to a Seventh-day Adventist missionary school,&lt;ref name=swau.edu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museum.swau.edu/history/legends/southpacific.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050508032757/http://museum.swau.edu/history/legends/southpacific.htm |archivedate=8 May 2005 |title=Keene's Legend in the South Pacific |publisher=The Herbert M. and Ivanette Woodall Hopps Museum and Welcome Center |first=Mary Ann |last=Hadley |date=17 April 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not speak English well. After the war Gasa and his wife Nelma had six children. They lived off coconuts and crops. They also caught fish in [[Vonavona lagoon]]. Gasa was the local patriarch, as most of the residents are descendants of the "old man" – as he was known – and he rarely left the island.

Gasa was still alive in August 2005 when the Pacific edition of ''Time'' magazine wrote that he was sick in the hospital. His children built a dugout canoe just like the ones the old man had made in his youth, to send to the United States "so they would not forget".  Biuku Gasa died on 23 November 2005, the day after the 42nd anniversary of Kennedy's assassination.

Eroni Kumana said he was 78 in 2003, and would have been 18 in 1943. Also schooled by Adventist missionaries,&lt;ref name=swau.edu/&gt; he lived in Konqu Village, Ranongga Island. He was seen in ''National Geographic'' photographs with a hat and a T-shirt that read "I rescued JFK". Kumana created a shrine with an obelisk to JFK, and appointed him honorary chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/National-Geographic-Search-Kennedys-Special/dp/B0001WTX5U | title=The Search for Kennedy's PT-109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kumana died on 2 August 2014, 71 years to the day after the search mission began. He was 96.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyti.ms/1oZSxyN]

'''Edward William Cox''' (1809–1879) was an English lawyer and legal writer, who was also a successful publisher. He has been described as "the greatest entrepreneur of 'class' journalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal=Victorian periodicals review | volume=17–18 | author=Research Society for Victorian Periodicals | publisher=University of Toronto | year=1984 | page=153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Cox was born in [[Taunton]], the son of William Cox, a manufacturer and Harriet, daughter of William Upcott of [[Exeter]]. He became a solicitor in Taunton, and in 1836 established a local newspaper there, the ''[[Somerset County Gazette]]''. He was [[called to the bar]] in 1843, joined the Western Circuit, and sold the title.

==Legal career==
Cox moved to London to pursue his career as a barrister. His periodicals, reports and textbooks led to him being raised to the dignity of [[serjeant at law]] in 1868 – rather than his modest practice as a lawyer.

He held various significant legal appointments – [[Recorder (legal office)|Recorder]] of [[Helston]] and [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] 1857–1868 which he resigned when gaining the more important appointment as Recorder of [[Portsmouth]]. In 1870 he became Deputy Assistant Judge of the Middlesex Sessions, a position he continued to discharge until his death.

==Publisher==
Around the time he was called to the bar, Cox founded the weekly ''[[Law Times]]'' which he conducted for nearly 25 years. He also founded or transformed the English journals ''[[The Field (magazine)|The Field]]'', bought cheaply from [[Benjamin Nottingham Webster]],{{sfn|Boase|1887}}and the ''[[Exchange &amp; Mart]]''; also ''The Queen'', founded by [[Samuel Beeton]] and bought by Cox in 1862, merged in 1863 with ''Ladies' Paper'', and edited by Elizabeth Lowe under Horace Cox (his nephew),&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=56286|title=Lowe, Elizabeth|first=Anne|last=Sebba|authorlink=Anne Sebba}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''County Courts' Chronicle''. An enduring publication was ''[[Crockford's Clerical Directory]]'', started in 1858, although whether it was really his creation or that of his junior partner, [[John Crockford]], remains an area of debate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crockford.org.uk/standard.asp?id=126 an extended version of an article in the Dictionary of National Biography&lt;/ref&gt; Cox also set up his own newspapers. Some of them, like ''The Critic'', had only limited success, but others such as ''Bazaar'' were profitable.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Andrews, Henry Richard Fox Bourne, Joseph Hatton, ''Chapters in the History of British Journalism'' (1999) pp.208–211&lt;/ref&gt; Long before his death, he relinquished direct control over the publishing businesses but he continued to write.

==In politics==

A lifelong Conservative, he unsuccessfully contested [[Tewkesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Tewkesbury]] in 1854 and [[Taunton (UK Parliament constituency)|Taunton]] in 1866. He did get elected in his native town 1868 but was unseated on petition by [[Henry James, 1st Baron James of Hereford|Henry James]]; James successfully brought a bribery petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=34149|title=James, Henry|first=Patrick|last=Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox was a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] and JP for Middlesex, and a JP for Westminster.

==Other interests==
Cox spent freely on his joint interests on [[orchids]] and [[psychology]]. He had lectured on [[phrenology]] in 1834, and retained an interest in it.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Cooter, ''The Cultural Meaning of Popular Science: phrenology and the organization of consent in nineteenth-century Britain'' (1984), p. 278; [https://books.google.com/books?id=YxKmmMel0W0C&amp;pg=PA278 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; The London Dialectical Society, founded in 1867, set up in 1869 a committee to investigate [[spiritualism]], of which Cox was a member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/london-dialectical-society answers.com, Gale Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology, ''London Dialectical Society''].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871 he assisted [[William Crookes]] in his experiments into what Cox called "[[Energy (esotericism)|psychic force]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The spiritualists: the story of Florence Cook and William Crookes | first=Trevor H. | last=Hall | publisher=Helix Press | year=1963 | pages=79–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox was interested in the psychological side of [[mediumship]].&lt;ref&gt;William Hodson Brock, ''William Crookes (1832–1919) and the Commercialization of Science'' (2008), p. 126; [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dd75mKOE4BMC&amp;pg=PA126 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; Some have viewed him as a spiritualist rather than one interested in "secular" psychology;&lt;ref&gt;Times, Wednesday, 26 November 1879; pg. 8; Issue 29735; col B Obituary. Times, Wednesday, 28 February 1973; pg. 5; Issue 58719; col F Crockford's now well taped by computer by Philip Howard. "Was Serjeant Cox a Spiritualist? Psypioneer Vol 2 No. 11 Nov 2006 pp.242–8.&lt;/ref&gt; but he is said to have rejected the "[[spirit hypothesis]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Spence, ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology'', Part 1 (2003), p. 195; [https://books.google.com/books?id=U1qqguX24fAC&amp;pg=PA195 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, he founded the Psychological Society for Great Britain, with [[George Harris (writer)|George Harris]];&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=12389|title=Harris, George|first=Catherine|last=Pease-Watkin}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was quickly dissolved after his death. In 1876 he passed to the medium [[Daniel Dunglas Home]] details of trickery used by others in [[séance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Oppenheim, ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850–1914'' (1988), p. 18; [https://books.google.com/books?id=VcBs8enYCCcC&amp;pg=PA18 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox bought the [[fee simple]] ([[freehold (English law)|unfettered freehold]]) of the [[Serjeants' Inn]] in [[Chancery Lane]] at auction in 1877 for £57,100.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details.mvc/Collection/?iAID=11969 National Archives, ''Serjeants' Inn, Chancery Lane: Records'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Times, Monday, 29 October 1906; pg. 3; Issue 38163; col B&lt;/ref&gt; The Inn's hall was reconstructed at his new house at [[Mill Hill]] (then [[Middlesex]], now London, NW7) with the original stained glass windows from the hall and chapel at the inn.&lt;ref&gt;''Six Lectures on the Inns of Court and of Chancery'' (Delivered in Middle Temple Hall during Easter and Trinity Terms, 1912), Macmillan and Co., 1912; Hugh H. L. Bellot, ''The Inner and Middle Temple: Legal, Literary And Historic Associations'',  p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

His diversification proved profitable. When one of his heirs offered their reversionary interest in Cox's probate estate for sale the advertisement listed the sources of income. These included various leasehold properties in the City of London, [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] Mills in Buckinghamshire, his newspaper and magazine titles as well as his landed property. Taken together, these had produced £54,000 a year for some years, although the bulk of the income came from Cox's magazines and newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Times, Friday, 13 August 1897; pg. 14; col F&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landed estate ==
Cox is an example of the wealthy early Victorian middle class men who established large landed estates.&lt;ref&gt;D. Brown, ''Matthew Boulton, Enclosure and Landed Society'' in M. Dick ed., Matthew Boulton A Revolutionary Player 2008 p.61&lt;/ref&gt; He began in 1866 by the purchase of Moat Mount. He rebuilt the house as a Renaissance-style stuccoed villa to include a large main block with a carriage porch, and by 1873 owned {{convert|209|acre|km2}} in [[Middlesex]]. He and his son continued to add to the estate in [[Hendon]] and [[Edgware]] until it covered perhaps {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} of valuable land near London. The estate included [[Moat Mount Park]] (120 acres), plus Coventry Farm (of 127 acres), Stoneyfields, Broadfields, Bays Hill, and Barnet Gate. Cox kept a pack of hounds, and he and his son hunted over what are now [[Golders Green]], Hendon, [[Mill Hill]] and [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Wentworth Day]], ''The Dog in Sport''.&lt;/ref&gt; While some land was sold in 1906, {{convert|1090|acre|km2}} remained to form public open spaces and part of the Broadfields housing estate in Edgware when the Cox estate was finally broken up in June 1923.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 5''(1976), pp. 21–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox was also lord of the manors of Taunton Deane and Trull in Somerset.&lt;ref&gt;''Bristol and Somerset Directory'' 1875&lt;/ref&gt; He also owned small estates at Ugborough and Widecombe in Devon. He died worth a reputed £400,000; although his estate was declared as under £200,000, he owned at least as much again in landed property.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', Wednesday, 24 December 1879; pg. 11; Issue 29759; col D; WILLS AND BEQUESTS&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Cox married twice. His first wife, Sophia, was the daughter of William Harris of the [[Royal Artillery]], and they married in 1836. In 1845 he married Rosalinda Fonblanque, the only daughter of [[John Samuel Martin Fonblanque]], a [[Commissioner of Bankruptcy (England and Wales)|Commissioner in Bankruptcy]]. The son from his first marriage was [[Irwin E. B. Cox]], and he had a daughter now known as the novelist Mrs H. Bennett Edwards (1844–1936); there was another son, from the second marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', Thursday, 27 November 1879; pg. 6; Issue 29736; col E Obituary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]], ''The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction'' (1990), p. 207; [https://books.google.com/books?id=QzJ3yNVVqtUC&amp;pg=PA207 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; Irwin Cox carried on his father's business interests, his acquisition of land and his preservation of game on the Mill Hill estate until his death in 1922 when the estate was broken up.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', Wednesday, 30 August 1922; pg. 5; Issue 43123; col C&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Federico Caffè''' (born 6 January 1914; disappeared 15 April 1987; [[declared death in absentia|declared dead]] 30 October 1998) was a notable [[Italy|Italian]] [[economist]] from the "Keynesian School".

== Early life ==
Caffè graduated in Business Sciences from the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]] in 1936. He started his career working at the [[Banca d'Italia|Bank of Italy]], later becoming a teacher at the [[University of Messina]]. From 1959 he taught Economic and Financial Policy at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]], forming several generations of economists in what is the largest university in Italy.

==Career==
Caffè mentored several generations of Italian economists, many of whom rose to senior positions in academia, political life and public administration.

In different capacities he mentored the former Governor of the [[Banca d'Italia|Bank of Italy]], and the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] President, Professor [[Mario Draghi]], the current Governor of the [[Banca d'Italia|Bank of Italy]], [[Ignazio Visco]], the welfare economist [[Bruno Amoroso]], the [[labour economics|labour economist]] [[Ezio Tarantelli]], killed by the [[Red Brigades]] in 1985 in the courtyard of the Faculty of Economics in [[Rome]] where they taught, the former President of the Italian Statistical Office [[Guido M. Rey]], the former President of the Italian Statistical Office and Minister for Welfare [[Enrico Giovannini]], the Economic policy's international expert [[Nicola Acocella]], the neo-ricardian economist [[Fernando Vianello]] and economist of innovation [[Daniele Archibugi]].

==Views==
Caffè was particularly interested in [[economic policy]] and welfare, especially in their social dimensions. One of his books, ''Lezioni di politica economica'' (Lectures on Economic Policy), is widely regarded as the complete summary of his ideas. He was a strong critic of [[free trade]], avowedly [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] in inspiration, and also very interested in the [[Scandinavian welfare model]].&lt;ref&gt;See Nicola Acocella and Mario Tiberi, [http://www.worldeconomicsassociation.org/newsletterarticles/federico-caffe-the-man-the-teaching-and-the-intellectual-path/Federico Caffè: the man, the teaching, and the intellectual path], ''World Economic Forum Association Newsletter'', 4(1), February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
On 15 April 1987 Caffè suddenly disappeared, shortly after having quit university teaching. He was "officially declared dead" on 30 October 1998. The mystery involved in his death has not been revealed. He may have committed suicide, but he may also have decided to disappear to an unknown location.&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Archibugi, [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2012/04/08/ragazzi-che-cercarono-il-professor-caffe.html I ragazzi che cercarono il professor Caffè], La Repubblica, 8 aprile 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memorials ==
Several institutions have been named after him, including the Faculty of Economics of the [[Roma Tre University|University of Rome III]], the [[Roskilde University]] Centre for Southern European Studies and the Library of the Department of Economics of the Faculty of Economics and Business of the Sapienza University of Rome. The Aula Magna of Pescara University is called Federico Caffè also. The [[Sapienza University of Rome]] also organizes annual conference that have been held by some of the most significant economists of our age. Many of the lectures have been published in a series of the [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/it/academic/subjects/economics/macroeconomics-and-monetary-economics/series/federico-caffe-lectures Cambridge University Press Federico Caffè Lectures, edited by Nicola Acocella and Mario Tiberi]&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel, a vagrant and former serviceman, was charged with the murder of Father Hubert Dahme, a popular Catholic priest, at the intersection of High and Main Street in downtown Bridgeport in the evening of Feb. 4, 1924. Twelve thousand people attended the funeral.

Eight days later, Israel, who had been arrested in [[Norwalk, Connecticut]] on a gun-possession charge,&lt;ref name='Times'/&gt; was accused of the murder.

At arraignment on May 27, 1924, Cummings dropped the case, entered a plea of [[nolle prosequi]],&lt;ref name='Encyclopedia'/&gt; and proceeded to discredit the evidence compiled by the Bridgeport police in a 90-minute presentation to the court.&lt;ref name='Unlikely'/&gt;

Cummings rebutted the circumstantial case against Israel, who was serving a 90-day jail term for possession of the .32 caliber revolver,&lt;ref name='Times'/&gt; and said that the confession was coerced from a person of diminished mental capacity. Three physicians had found that Israel was exhausted and overwhelmed, and Israel said he would have confessed to anything just to get some sleep. Cummings called expert witnesses who undermined the ballistics evidence.&lt;ref name='Rotarian'/&gt;

Cummings told the court that "it is just as important for a state's attorney to use the great powers of his office to protect the innocent as it is to convict the guilty."&lt;ref name='Encyclopedia'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Times'/&gt;

Cummings' decision to drop the case surprised and outraged Bridgeport police, and Cummings received criticism from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], where he was a national committeeman. However, despite being snubbed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, he was chosen by Roosevelt as his first Attorney General.&lt;ref name='Unlikely'/&gt;

The case was never solved.&lt;ref name='Rotarian'/&gt; In 1954, a Bridgeport resident admitted to witnessing the killing, said that he was threatened with death if he spoke about it, and said that Israel was not the killer.&lt;ref name='Unlikely'/&gt;

Israel later married and had "a house, a Ford, a wife, and a child."&lt;ref name='Rotarian'/&gt; In ''Boomerang!'', which was largely filmed in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], the character based on Israel was played by [[Arthur Kennedy (actor)|Arthur Kennedy]].

'''Henri Caesar''', also known as '''Black Caesar''', ([[floruit|fl.]] 1791-1830) was a legendary 19th-century [[Haiti]]an revolutionary and pirate. Efforts to find historical evidence of his existence have been unsuccessful. According to works of fiction, he was a participant in the [[Haitian Revolution]] under [[Dutty Boukman]] and [[Toussaint Louverture]] as well as active in piracy for nearly a 30-year period during the early 19th century.

Henri Caesar has been confused with a real pirate who was also known as [[Black Caesar (pirate)|Black Caesar]] and operated from the [[Florida Keys]] in the early 1700s until being captured and hanged in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] in 1718.

==Biography==
Henri Caesar was supposedly born to a slave family kept by a French plantation owner known as Arnaut. He worked as a houseboy on the estate and, as a young man, worked in the lumberyard. He was mistreated by the supervisor and later killed the man during the [[Haitian Revolution|slave insurrection]], torturing him with a [[saw]]. Joining the rebel forces led by [[Dutty Boukman]] and [[Toussaint Louverture]], he remained with the revolution until its independence from [[France]] in 1804, when he left to try his luck at sea. Based in [[Port-de-Paix]], he captured a Spanish ship in 1805 and soon began attacking small villages and lone vessels near [[Cuba]] and [[the Bahamas]] from his base in southern [[Spanish Florida]]. Adopting the name Black Caesar, he was very successful during his piratical career before his disappearance in 1830.

His fate is uncertain. He may have fled the area after President [[Andrew Jackson]] ordered an expedition against pirates active on the Florida coast after its purchase by the [[United States]] in 1821. One version of his story says that he was captured, taken to [[Key West]], and burned to death while tied to a tree. The widow of a preacher whose eyes had been burned out under torture from Black Caesar was allowed light the fire.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Kevin M. ''Twenty Florida Pirates''. Sarasota, Florida: Pineapple Press, 1994. (pg. 41) {{ISBN|1-56164-050-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar is supposed to have buried between $2 and $6 million at one of more locations in [[southwest Florida]] including [[Pine Island (Lee County, Florida)|Pine Island]], White Horse Key, [[Marco Island]], Elliot Key and [[Sanibel Island]], although none has ever been recovered. He is sometimes associated with [[Jose Gaspar]], another mythical pirate who supposedly operated in the same area at about the same time.

'''Isaac Abrahamszoon Massa''' (baptized October 7, 1586, in [[Haarlem]], died 1643)&lt;ref&gt;Year of death, 1643, as in Keuning, p. 65. Russian sources (e.g. Massa, 1997 p. 467) state it as 1635&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] grain trader, traveller and diplomat, the envoy to [[Muscovy]]. He wrote memoirs related to the [[Time of Troubles]] and created some of the earliest maps of [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Siberia]]. Due to Massa's experience in and knowledge of Muscovy, he was considered a Dutch "[[Kremlinologist]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/3.CS/3.L/3.L.30.html Death of the first false Dmitrii]&lt;/ref&gt; The Isaac Massa Foundation was established in his honor in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]. It  aims to stimulate scientific and cultural contacts between the Russian Federation and the Netherlands.

==Biography==

Isaac Massa was born into a wealthy silk merchant's family; his father Abraham Massa had relocated the family from [[Liège]] to [[Haarlem]] before Isaac was born. His ancestors could have been French [[Huguenot]]s who fled their homeland in the beginning of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].&lt;ref name=p466&gt;Massa, 1997 p. 466&lt;/ref&gt; The family surname was also known as ''Massart,'' ''Massaert,'' suggesting French origins, which is where most Huguenots started. Under religious persecution, they generally relocated to Protestant countries, such as England and those of northern Europe.

In 1601 Massa left Haarlem for [[Moscow]] to assist the family trade.&lt;ref&gt;Russian sources (Massa, 1997 p. 467) state that he was sent by his father, but Keuning suggests that Abraham Massa may have died as early as 1598.&lt;/ref&gt; Isaac was witness to the second half of [[Boris Godunov]]'s reign, during which a civil war broke out, now known as the [[Time of Troubles]]. He survived the capture of Moscow by [[False Dmitriy&amp;nbsp;I]] and left Russia in 1609, before the fall of Tsar [[Vasili IV of Russia|Vasily Shuysky]]. 

Massa compiled an account of the 1601–1609 events ({{lang-nl|Een cort Verhael van Begin en Oorspronk deser tegenwoordighe Oorloogen en troeblen in Moscovia totten jare 1610}}), which he presented to [[Stadtholder]] [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Maurice]]. It was reproduced in print in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=p466/&gt; In 1612–1613 Massa published two articles on Russian events and the geography of the ''[[Samoyedic peoples|Land of Samoyeds]],''&lt;ref&gt;Fragments reprinted in Schilder, p. 500&lt;/ref&gt; accompanied by a map of Russia, which were published in an [[almanac]] edited by [[Hessel Gerritsz]]. His notes on his various travels have been published in conjunction with maps made by the explorer [[Henry Hudson]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=teNMaUXW1tgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA269&amp;lpg=RA1-PA269&amp;dq=Isaac+Massa+Henry+Hudson&amp;source=web&amp;ots=94OoD9KeMC&amp;sig=WBycFDT_FbsZQHbI5j7aHA15Wpw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Asher, G.M. (2001) ''Henry Hudson the Navigator,'' p. 269]&lt;/ref&gt;

These articles were translated and reproduced anonymously in European languages, because the author's name was removed in early Dutch reissues. The most complete translations were published in Russian in 1937 (reissued in 1997) and in English in 1982. Massa's writing was based on an underlying religious concept of punishment for sins being indispensable. He believed that Godunov, False Dimitri, and the nation itself paid for their mortal sins. (Massa believed that Godunov killed [[Feodor I of Russia|Feodor&amp;nbsp;I]] and the real [[Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia (born 1582)|Tsarevich Dimitri]]). Russian sources consider him the least biased of contemporary Western witnesses, and very well informed. (His contemporary, [[Jacob De la Gardie]], characterized Massa as "extremely artful in learning other people's secrets").&lt;ref name=p468&gt;Massa, 1997 p. 468&lt;/ref&gt;

Massa is credited with five published maps of Russia and its provinces, the last ones compiled around 1633, and two maps of Moscow city, including the schematic account of the 1606 battle between Vasily Shuysky and [[Ivan Bolotnikov]]'s armies.&lt;ref name=p467&gt;Massa, 1997 p. 467&lt;/ref&gt; Retrieving original maps of the city could have been dangerous for Massa himself and fatal for his Russian sources.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Massa's rendition of the [[Siberia]]n coast represented an advance in geography; for decades it was the only map of this region. It was subsequently copied by [[Gerardus Mercator]] and [[Jodocus Hondius]], [[Jan Janssonius]] and [[Willem Blaeu]].&lt;ref&gt;Schilder, p. 501&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Massa - Caerte van't Noorderste Russen, Samojeden, ende Tingoesen Landt.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Map of the north of Russia, the land of the [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyedic]] and [[Evenks|Tunguz]]; with the [[Taz Estuary]], [[Vaygach Island]], [[Yamal Peninsula|Yamal]] and [[Gydan Peninsula]] ]]

In 1614 Massa returned to Moscow, this time accompanied by his brothers, as an envoy of [[States-General of the Netherlands]] to obtain an exclusive trade agreement similar to the recent Dutch-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] treaty, and to investigate the trade routes into [[Persia]]. Not only had the Dutch been keen to purchase grains but also Persian silks. These had, equally so, been exported via [[Archangelsk]]. At the time Russian people showed great interest in artillery compounds such as lead and gunpowder.

An average of thirty ships sailed each year to Archangelsk, a harbour near the [[White Sea]]&amp;nbsp;– unfortunately during 1619 a fire broke out and destroyed the city completely, thereby ruining Massa's inventory. Additionally, upon his return Massa's ship encountered a heavy storm near [[Sápmi (area)|Lapland]].&lt;ref&gt;Wijnroks, E. (2000) Handel tussen Rusland en de Nederlanden, 1560–1640: een netwerkanalyse van de Antwerpse en Amsterdamse kooplieden, handelend op Rusland, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1622 he married Beatrix van der Laen, the daughter of a [[Remonstrant]] [[burgomaster]]. When Hals had a child baptized, Massa was a witness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onh.nl/nl-NL/verhaal/9208/woonhuis-van-isaac-massa|title=Woonhuis van Isaac Massa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1623/24 Massa was called upon by the Dutch Parliament ([[Staten-Generaal]]) to become an agent for [[Moscovia]]. However, his appointment proved to be a controversial one and drew serious opposition. He then made successful efforts to gain the interest of [[Gustaf&amp;nbsp;II Adolf of Sweden]] to pursue trading grains with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, P.W. (1974) De Trippen in de 17e eeuw, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; While nourishing the relationships between Russia and Sweden, he was knighted by the Swedish King in 1625 for his arduous efforts. One year later, in 1626, he attempted to gain exclusive rights on the trading of grains out of Russia.

Massa promoted the idea of setting up a trading [[cartel]] similar to the English [[Muscovy Company]], but internal problems in the Netherlands delayed consolidation of traders into 1628.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, pp. 161, 165&lt;/ref&gt; During his next voyage, in 1629, he travelled to Moscow to pave the way for his friend Elias Trip who by then had initiated a consortium. Massa indiscreetly advised [[Michael&amp;nbsp;I of Russia]] and Michael's father, [[Patriarch Philaret of Moscow|Filaret]] (the Patriarch of Moscow) of the internal affairs of the Dutch Republic. By doing so he attempted to tarnish the reputation of his competitors and personal opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Raptschinsky, B. (1937) Uit de geschiedenis van den Amsterdamschen handel op Rusland in de XVIIe eeuw. Georg Everhard Kleinck. In: Jaarboek {{ill|Amstelodamum|nl}}, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frans Hals - Wedding portrait of Isaac Abrahamsz Massa and Beatrix van der Laan.jpg|thumb|[[Marriage Portrait of Isaac Massa and Beatrix van der Laen|Portrait of Isaac Massa and his wife, Beatrix van der Laen]]&amp;nbsp;– by [[Frans Hals]], [[Rijksmuseum]]]]

Because of the ongoing war between Sweden and Poland no grain could be exported through the city of [[Gdańsk|Dantzig]].&lt;ref&gt;Dillen, J.G. van (1970) Van Rijkdom en Regenten, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his opponents, Klenck, himself a wealthy merchant trading in [[caviar]], was given Russia's permission to export ten or twelve cargo loads of rye meal. Meanwhile Trip feigned to act on behalf of the Swedish Monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, P.W. (1974) De Trippen in de 17e eeuw, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1630 the price of grain remained extremely high due to increasing competition. [[Albert Burgh]] tried to ensure a monopoly for the City of Amsterdam. At the same time, countries such as Sweden and England endeavoured to do the same. Russian merchants tried to curtail trading by limiting import and export exclusively via Archangelsk. For the next two decades Massa combined diplomatic service with his own business.

==Paintings by Frans Hals==
[[File:Isaac Massa.pdf|thumb|Meiden, G.W. (1993) Isaac Massa and the beginning of the Dutch-Russian relations, p. 1-16]]

Massa has been the subject of several portraits by Dutch painter [[Frans Hals]], including a [[Marriage Portrait of Isaac Massa and Beatrix van der Laen|a marriage portrait with his wife, Beatrix Van Der Laen, dated 1622]] and a [[Portrait of Isaak Abrahamsz. Massa|solo portrait of him leaning over the back of a chair dated 1626]], and .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/aria/aria_assets/SK-A-133?id=SK-A-133&amp;page=0&amp;lang=en&amp;context_space=&amp;context_id=|title=Portrait of a Couple, Probably Isaac Abrahamsz Massa and Beatrix van der Laen, Frans Hals, c. 1622 - Rijksmuseum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding portrait is considered unique in composition for the period.,&lt;ref&gt;Westermann, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The novel composition, "picnic style", may have been Massa's own design.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; Massa owned a country house near [[Lisse]], next to his brother-in-law, [[Adriaen Maertensz Block]]. He was the protector of [[Torrentius]], a notorious painter from Haarlem.

'''Jacques''' (also wrongly known as ''Jacques Augustin'' and ''Jacques Aoûtin'') '''Antoine Mourgue''' (2 June 1734, [[Marsillargues]] – 15 January 1818, [[Paris]]) was a French politician and minister. He served as [[Interior Minister (France)|Interior Minister]] for five days from 12 to 18 June 1792 during  the [[French Revolution]]. He was buried in the 39th division of the [[cimetière du Père-Lachaise]].

'''James Prescott Joule''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS|FRSE}} ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|uː|l}};&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]: "Although some people of this name call themselves {{IPA|(dʒaʊl)}}, and others {{IPA|(dʒəʊl)}} [the OED format for {{IPAc-en|dʒ|oʊ|l}}], it is almost certain that J. P. Joule (and at least some of his relatives) used {{IPA|(dʒuːl)}}."&lt;/ref&gt; 24 December 1818{{snd}} 11 October 1889) was an English [[physicist]], [[mathematician]] and [[brewing (beer)|brewer]], born in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], [[Lancashire]]. Joule studied the nature of [[heat]], and discovered its relationship to [[mechanical work]] (see [[energy]]). This led to the [[law of conservation of energy]], which in turn led to the development of the [[first law of thermodynamics]]. The [[SI derived unit]] of energy, the [[joule]], is named after him.

Joule worked with [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] to develop an absolute thermodynamic [[temperature]] scale, which came to be called the [[Kelvin]] scale. Joule also made observations of [[magnetostriction]], and he found the relationship between the [[electric current|current]] through a [[resistor]] and the heat [[dissipation|dissipated]], which is also called [[Joule's first law]]. His experiments about energy transformations were first published in 1843.

==Early years==

James Joule was born in 1818, the son of Benjamin Joule (1784–1858), a wealthy [[brewer]], and his wife, Alice Prescott, on New Bailey Street in [[City of Salford|Salford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joule was tutored as a young man by the famous scientist [[John Dalton]] and was strongly influenced by chemist [[William Henry (chemist)|William Henry]] and [[Manchester]] engineers [[Peter Ewart]] and [[Eaton Hodgkinson]]. He was fascinated by [[electricity]], and he and his brother experimented by giving electric shocks to each other and to the family's servants.

As an adult, Joule managed the brewery. Science was merely a serious hobby. Sometime around 1840, he started to investigate the feasibility of replacing the brewery's [[steam engine]]s with the newly invented [[electric motor]]. His first [[scientific paper]]s on the subject were contributed to [[William Sturgeon]]'s ''Annals of Electricity''. Joule was a member of the [[London Electrical Society]], established by Sturgeon and others.

Motivated in part by a businessman's desire to quantify the [[economics]] of the choice, and in part by his scientific inquisitiveness, he set out to determine which prime mover was more efficient. He discovered [[Joule's first law]] in 1841, that ''the [[heat]] which is evolved by the proper action of any [[Voltaic pile|voltaic current]] is proportional to the square of the intensity of that current, multiplied by the resistance to [[conduction (heat)|conduction]] which it experiences''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joule|first=J.P.|title=On the Heat evolved by Metallic Conductors of Electricity, and in the Cells of a Battery during Electrolysis|journal=Philosophical Magazine| year=1841|volume=19|page=260|doi=10.1080/14786444108650416| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJEOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA260|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to realize that burning a [[pound (mass)|pound]] of coal in a steam engine was more economical than a costly pound of [[zinc]] consumed in an electric [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. Joule captured the output of the alternative methods in terms of a common standard, the ability to raise a mass weighing one pound to a height of one [[foot (unit of length)|foot]], the ''foot-pound''.

However, Joule's interest diverted from the narrow financial question to that of how much work could be extracted from a given source, leading him to speculate about the [[convertibility]] of [[energy]]. In 1843 he published results of experiments showing that the [[heat]]ing effect he had quantified in 1841 was due to generation of heat in the [[conductor (material)|conductor]] and not its transfer from another part of the equipment. This was a direct challenge to the [[caloric theory]] which held that heat could neither be created or destroyed. Caloric theory had dominated thinking in the science of heat since introduced by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] in 1783. Lavoisier's prestige and the practical success of [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]]'s caloric theory of the [[heat engine]] since 1824 ensured that the young Joule, working outside either [[academy|academia]] or the [[engineering]] profession, had a difficult road ahead. Supporters of the caloric theory readily pointed to the symmetry of the [[Peltier–Seebeck effect]] to claim that heat and current were convertible in an, at least approximately, [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]].

==The mechanical equivalent of heat==

Further experiments and measurements with his electric motor led Joule to estimate the ''[[mechanical equivalent of heat]]'' as 4.1868 [[joules]] per [[calorie]] of work to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one Kelvin.&lt;ref&gt;Joule's unit of 1&amp;nbsp;ft&amp;nbsp;lbf/Btu corresponds to {{val|5.3803|e=-3|u=J/cal}}. Thus Joule's estimate was 4.15&amp;nbsp;J/cal, compared to the value accepted by the beginning of the 20th century of 4.1860 J/cal (M.W. Zemansky (1968) ''Heat and Thermodynamics'', 5th ed., p.&amp;nbsp;86).&lt;/ref&gt; He announced his results at a meeting of the chemical section of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in August 1843 and was met by silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joule|first=J.P.|title=On the Calorific Effects of Magneto-Electricity, and on the Mechanical Value of Heat| journal=Philosophical Magazine|year=1843| volume=23|series=3|pages=263, 347 &amp; 435| url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/20095#page/279/mode/1up |accessdate=4 March 2014| doi=10.1080/14786444308644766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joule was undaunted and started to seek a purely mechanical demonstration of the conversion of work into heat. By forcing water through a perforated cylinder, he could measure the slight [[viscosity|viscous]] heating of the fluid. He obtained a mechanical equivalent of 770&amp;nbsp;[[Foot-pound force|ft·lbf]]/[[British thermal unit|Btu]] (4.14&amp;nbsp;joule/calorie (J/cal)). The fact that the values obtained both by electrical and purely mechanical means were in agreement to at least one [[order of magnitude]] was, to Joule, compelling evidence of the reality of the convertibility of work into heat.

{{quote|Wherever mechanical force is expended, an exact equivalent of heat is always obtained.|J.P. Joule, August, 1843}}

Joule now tried a third route. He measured the heat generated against the work done in compressing a gas. He obtained a mechanical equivalent of 798&amp;nbsp;ft·lbf/Btu (4.29&amp;nbsp;J/cal). In many ways, this experiment offered the easiest target for Joule's critics but Joule disposed of the anticipated objections by clever experimentation. Joule read his paper to the [[Royal Society]] on 20 June 1844,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|last=Joule|first=J.P.|title=On the Changes of Temperature Produced by the Rarefaction and Condensation of Air|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society|Proceedings of the Royal Society of London]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MfYrAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA517|volume=5|year=1844|doi=10.1098/rspl.1843.0031}} and ''Scientific Papers'' p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; however, his paper was rejected for publishing by the Royal Society and he had to be content with publishing in the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'' in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Joule, J.P. | title = On the Changes of Temperature Produced by the Rarefaction and Condensation of Air | journal = Philosophical Magazine |series = 3 | volume = 26| issue = 174 |year = 1845| pages=369–383 |url = https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/20067#page/382/mode/2up | doi=10.1080/14786444508645153}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the paper he was forthright in his rejection of the [[Caloric theory|caloric]] reasoning of Carnot and [[Émile Clapeyron]], a rejection partly [[theology|theologically]] driven:

{{quote|I conceive that this theory&amp;nbsp;... is opposed to the recognised principles of philosophy because it leads to the conclusion that ''[[vis viva]]'' may be destroyed by an improper disposition of the apparatus: Thus Mr Clapeyron draws the inference that 'the temperature of the fire being 1000&amp;nbsp;°C to 2000&amp;nbsp;°C higher than that of the boiler there is an enormous loss of ''vis viva'' in the passage of the heat from the furnace to the boiler.' Believing that the power to destroy belongs to the Creator alone I affirm&amp;nbsp;... that any theory which, when carried out, demands the annihilation of force, is necessarily erroneous.}}

Joule here adopts the language of ''vis viva'' (energy), possibly because Hodgkinson had read a review of Ewart's ''On the measure of moving force'' to the Literary and Philosophical Society in April 1844.

Joule wrote in his 1844 paper:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;the mechanical power exerted in turning a magneto-electric machine is ''converted into the heat'' evolved by the passage of the currents of induction through its coils; and, on the other hand, that the motive power of the electromagnetic engine is obtained at the expense of the heat due to the chemical reactions of the battery by which it is worked.}}

In June 1845, Joule read his paper ''On the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat'' to the British Association meeting in [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Joule, J.P. (1845) [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/46638#page/429/mode/1up "On the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat"], ''Brit. Assoc. Rep., trans. Chemical Sect'', p.31, read before the British Association at Cambridge, June 1845&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, he reported his best-known experiment, involving the use of a falling weight, in which gravity does the mechanical work, to spin a [[paddle wheel]] in an insulated barrel of water which increased the temperature. He now estimated a mechanical equivalent of 819&amp;nbsp;ft·lbf/Btu (4.41 J/cal). He wrote a letter to the Philosophical Magazine, published in September 1845 describing his experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joule|first=J.P.|title=On the Existence of an Equivalent Relation between Heat and the ordinary Forms of Mechanical Power|journal=Philosophical Magazine |date=1845|volume=27|series=3|issue=179 | pages=205–207|doi=10.1080/14786444508645256 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/19987#page/219/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Joule's heat apparatus.JPG|thumb|right|Joule's Heat Apparatus, 1845]]

In 1850, Joule published a refined measurement of 772.692&amp;nbsp;ft·lbf/Btu (4.159&amp;nbsp;J/cal), closer to twentieth century estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joule|first=J.P.|title=On the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat|journal=[[Philosophical Transactions]] of the Royal Society of London|date=1850|volume=140|pages=61–82|doi=10.1098/rstl.1850.0004|url=https://archive.org/stream/philtrans00608634/00608634#page/n0/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and priority==

[[Image:Joule's Apparatus (Harper's Scan).png|thumb|Joule's apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat]]
{{For|the controversy over priority with Mayer|Mechanical equivalent of heat#Priority}}
Much of the initial resistance to Joule's work stemmed from its dependence upon extremely [[accuracy and precision|precise]] [[measurement]]s. He claimed to be able to measure temperatures to within {{frac|200}} of a degree Fahrenheit (3&amp;nbsp;mK). Such precision was certainly uncommon in contemporary experimental physics but his doubters may have neglected his experience in the art of brewing and his access to its practical technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Sibum (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; He was also ably supported by [[Measuring instrument|scientific instrument]]-maker [[John Benjamin Dancer]]. Joule's experiments complemented the theoretical work of [[Rudolf Clausius]], who is considered by some to be the coinventor of the energy concept.

Joule was proposing a kinetic theory of heat (he believed it to be a form of rotational, rather than translational, [[kinetic energy]]), and this required a conceptual leap: if heat was a form of molecular motion, why didn't the motion of the molecules gradually die out? Joule's ideas required one to believe that the collisions of molecules were perfectly elastic. We should also remember that the very existence of [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s was not widely accepted for another 50 years.

Although it may be hard today to understand the allure of the [[caloric theory]], at the time it seemed to have some clear advantages. [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Carnot]]'s successful theory of heat engines had also been based on the caloric assumption, and only later was it proved by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] that Carnot's mathematics were equally valid without assuming a caloric fluid.

However, in Germany, [[Hermann Helmholtz]] became aware both of Joule's work and the similar 1842 work of [[Julius Robert von Mayer]]. Though both men had been neglected since their respective publications, Helmholtz's definitive 1847 declaration of the [[conservation of energy]] credited them both.

Also in 1847, another of Joule's presentations at the British Association in [[Oxford]] was attended by [[George Gabriel Stokes]], [[Michael Faraday]], and the precocious and maverick [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], later to become Lord Kelvin, who had just been appointed professor of [[natural philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]]. Stokes was "inclined to be a Joulite" and Faraday was "much struck with it" though he harboured doubts. Thomson was intrigued but sceptical.

Unanticipated, Thomson and Joule met later that year in [[Chamonix]]. Joule married Amelia Grimes on 18 August and the couple went on honeymoon. Marital enthusiasm notwithstanding, Joule and Thomson arranged to attempt an experiment a few days later to measure the temperature difference between the top and bottom of the [[Cascade de Sallanches]] waterfall, though this subsequently proved impractical.

Though Thomson felt that Joule's results demanded theoretical explanation, he retreated into a spirited defence of the Carnot-Clapeyron school. In his 1848 account of [[absolute temperature]], Thomson wrote that "the conversion of heat (or caloric) into mechanical effect is probably impossible, certainly undiscovered"&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal | author = Thomson, William | title = On an Absolute Thermometric Scale founded on Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat, and calculated from Regnault's Observations | journal = Philosophical Journal | year = 1848 }}- See also the account in {{cite book | author = Thomson, William | title = Mathematical and Physical Papers | year = 1882 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, England | pages = 100–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; – but a footnote signalled his first doubts about the caloric theory, referring to Joule's "very remarkable discoveries". Surprisingly, Thomson did not send Joule a copy of his paper but when Joule eventually read it he wrote to Thomson on 6 October, claiming that his studies had demonstrated conversion of heat into work but that he was planning further experiments. Thomson replied on the 27th, revealing that he was planning his own experiments and hoping for a reconciliation of their two views. Though Thomson conducted no new experiments, over the next two years he became increasingly dissatisfied with Carnot's theory and convinced of Joule's. In his 1851 paper, Thomson was willing to go no further than a compromise and declared "the whole theory of the motive power of heat is founded on&amp;nbsp;... two&amp;nbsp;... propositions, due respectively to Joule, and to Carnot and Clausius".

As soon as Joule read the paper he wrote to Thomson with his comments and questions. Thus began a fruitful, though largely epistolary, collaboration between the two men, Joule conducting experiments, Thomson analysing the results and suggesting further experiments. The collaboration lasted from 1852 to 1856, its discoveries including the [[Joule–Thomson effect]], and the published results did much to bring about general acceptance of Joule's work and the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]].

==Kinetic theory==

[[Image:Joule James Jeens engraving.jpg|right|thumb|James Prescott Joule]]
Kinetics is the science of motion. Joule was a pupil of Dalton and it is no surprise that he had learned a firm belief in the [[atomic theory]], even though there were many scientists of his time who were still skeptical. He had also been one of the few people receptive to the neglected work of [[John Herapath]] on the [[kinetic theory of gases]]. He was further profoundly influenced by [[Peter Ewart]]'s 1813 paper ''On the measure of moving force''.

Joule perceived the relationship between his discoveries and the kinetic theory of heat. His laboratory notebooks reveal that he believed heat to be a form of rotational, rather than translational motion.

Joule could not resist finding antecedents of his views in [[Francis Bacon]], Sir [[Isaac Newton]], [[John Locke]], [[Benjamin Thompson|Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford)]] and Sir [[Humphry Davy]]. Though such views are justified, Joule went on to estimate a value for the mechanical equivalent of heat of 1034 foot-pound&lt;!--what's this value?--&gt; from Rumford's publications. Some modern writers have criticised this approach on the grounds that Rumford's experiments in no way represented systematic quantitative measurements. In one of his personal notes, Joule contends that Mayer's measurement was no more [[accuracy and precision|accurate]] than Rumford's, perhaps in the hope that Mayer had not anticipated his own work.

Joule has been attributed with explaining the [[green flash]] phenomenon in a letter to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1869; actually, he merely noted (with a sketch) the last glimpse as bluish green, without attempting to explain the cause of the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/scientificpapers01joul#page/606/ Proc. Manchester Lit. Phil. Soc. 9, 1 (1869)] ''On an appearance of the setting sun'' reprinted as ''On Sunset seen at Southport''&lt;/ref&gt;

Joule died at home in [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]]&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Deaths: DEC 1889 8a 121 ALTRINCHAM – James Prescott Joule&lt;/ref&gt; and is buried in [[Brooklands, Sale|Brooklands]] cemetery there. His gravestone is inscribed with the number "772.55", his climacteric 1878 measurement of the mechanical equivalent of heat, in which he found that this amount of [[foot-pounds]] of work must be expended at [[sea level]] to raise the [[temperature]] of one [[pound (mass)|pound]] of water from 60 to 61&amp;nbsp;°F. There is also a quotation from the [[Gospel of John]]: "I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work" (9:4). The Wetherspoon's [[pub]] in [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]], the town of his death, is named "The J. P. Joule" after him. Joule's family brewery survives to this day but is now located in [[Market Drayton]] (see [http://www.joulesbrewery.co.uk Joule’s Brewery] for more information on origins).

Joule's many honours and commendations include:

*Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] (1850)
**[[Royal Medal]] (1852), 'For his paper on the mechanical equivalent of heat, printed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1850'
**[[Copley Medal]] (1870), 'For his experimental researches on the dynamical theory of heat'
*President of [[Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society]] (1860)
*President of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] (1872, 1887)
*Honorary Membership of the [[Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland]][http://www.iesis.org/honorary-fellows.html] (1857)
*Honorary degrees:
**[[Doctor of Laws|LL.D.]], [[Trinity College, Dublin]] (1857)
**[[Doctor of Civil Law|DCL]], [[University of Oxford]] (1860)
**LL.D., [[University of Edinburgh]] (1871)
*Joule received a [[civil list]] pension of [[GBP|£]]200 ''per annum'' in 1878 for services to science
*[[Albert Medal (RSA)|Albert Medal]] of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] (1880), 'for having established, after most laborious research, the true relation between heat, electricity and mechanical work, thus affording to the engineer a sure guide in the application of science to industrial pursuits'

There is a memorial to Joule in the north choir aisle of [[Westminster Abbey]], though he is not buried there, contrary to what some biographies state. A statue of Joule by [[Alfred Gilbert]] stands in [[Manchester Town Hall]], opposite that of Dalton.

'''Jason Healey''' is a director at the [[Atlantic Council]] in charge of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative.  He has published several academic articles, essays, and books on the topic of [[cyber security]] and has advised on security measures for corporate, government, and military institutions. He has been identified as the first historian of cyber conflict.

==History==
Healy was born and raised in [[Rhode Island]], and at 17, joined the United States Air Force.&lt;ref name=Vitaliev&gt;{{cite web|last=Vitaliev|first=Vitali|title=Interview with Jason Healey|url=http://eandt.theiet.org/magazine/2013/12/interview-jason-healy.cfm|work=E&amp;T Magazine|publisher=The Institution of Engineering and Technology|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially training to be a fighter pilot, Healey transitioned to [[signals intelligence]] and in 1998, began working at [[The Pentagon]] to implement a computer network defense system.&lt;ref name=Vitaliev /&gt;  During his Air Force career, Jason was awarded two [[Meritorious Service Medal (United States)|Meritorious Service Medals]] based on his contributions in cyber security during his service at [[the Pentagon]].&lt;ref name="privacy-pc1"&gt;{{cite web|author=David Balaban |url=http://privacy-pc.com/interviews/why-is-cyber-conflicts-amnesia-dangerous-interview-with-jason-healey-from-the-atlantic-council.html |title=Why is Cyber Conflicts Amnesia Dangerous? Interview with Jason Healey from the Atlantic Council |publisher=Privacy PC |date=2013-06-03 |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Healey later received a master's degree in Information Security from [[James Madison University]].&lt;ref name=Vitaliev /&gt;&lt;ref name="privacy-pc1"/&gt;

==Work in cyber policy==
Healey has worked in numerous settings with regard to cyber policy, its implementation, and addressing responses to security threats.  In [[Hong Kong]], he served as the vice president for [[Goldman Sachs]] where he developed a crisis-response system built to address incidents across the Asian continent.   He has also worked at [[The White House]] as the Director for Cyber Infrastructure Protection. He is currently a board member on the Cyber Conflict Studies Association and the Military Cyber Professionals Association.&lt;ref name="privacy-pc1"/&gt;  The extent of his work has led one magazine to refer to Healey as the first historian of cyber conflict.&lt;ref name=Vitaliev /&gt;

Frequently, Healey has publicly commented&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mullen |first=Shannon |url=http://www.marketplace.org/topics/tech/tech-companies-look-stay-ahead-hackers |title=Tech companies look to stay ahead of hackers |publisher=Marketplace.org |date=2013-07-09 |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karen Epper Hoffman |url=http://www.scmagazine.com/advanced-malware-the-growing-cyber-menace/article/329701/ |title=Advanced malware: The growing cyber menace |work=SC Magazine |date=2014-02-03 |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and written articles&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last=Healey|first=Jason|title=The Spectrum of National Responsibility for Cyberattacks|journal=[[Brown Journal of World Affairs]]|year=2011|volume=18|issue=1|pages=57–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JAA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Healey|first=Jason|title=Four ways to address cyberconflict – and how analytics can help|journal=Journal of Advanced Analytics|date=Q4, 2011|pages=32–34|url=http://www.sas.com/news/intelligence_quarterly/q411.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; on high-profile malware threats and cyber policy.  For instance, Healey has discussed the potential advantages and disadvantages of the [[United States]] launching cyber-based attacks.&lt;ref name=Gjelten&gt;{{cite web|last=Gjelten|first=Tom|title=Pentagon Goes On The Offensive Against Cyberattacks|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/02/11/171677247/pentagon-goes-on-the-offensive-against-cyber-attacks|work=[[Morning Edition]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In regards to such an offensive on [[Syria]], he stated that "you no longer have to drop physical bombs and kill people, that it can be targeted, non-lethal microforce", but further surmised that due to past leaks of the United States' involvement in [[Stuxnet]], relevant government agencies may have decided against it.&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;{{cite news|last=Todd|first=Brian|title=Syria: U.S. Cyber-Strike|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/bestoftv/2014/02/28/exp-tsr-todd-syria-us-cyber-strike.cnn&amp;iref=allsearch&amp;video_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fquery%3DCyber%2BStrike%2Bon%2BSyria%26x%3D0%26y%3D0%26primaryType%3Dmixed%26sortBy%3Drelevance%26intl%3Dfalse|work=The Situation Room|publisher=CNN|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Healey has also commented on the [[Heartbleed bug]], noting the failure of the NSA to live up to its stated priority of defense by not exposing the bug when it was found, and he said that the organization would be "shredded by the computer security community" for this failure.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA said to have exploited Heartbleed bug, exposing consumers|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/nsa-knew-heartbleed-web-flaw-article-1.1754163|accessdate=14 April 2014|newspaper=[[NY Daily News]]|date=12 April 2014|author=Bloomberg News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, Healey also took a critical stance on the current state of [[mass surveillance in the United States]].  He predicted that U.S. interests abroad would suffer "deep and long term damage" given that the administration could not implement any alternatives to spying conducted by the [[National Security Agency]].&lt;ref name=Strohm&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawmakers Spurn Obama Bid to Preserve NSA Data Gathering|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-06/lawmakers-spurn-obama-bid-to-preserve-nsa-data-gathering.html|accessdate=14 April 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg News|date=5 November 2013|author=Strohm, Chris|author2=Gaouette, Nicole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Healey published ''A Fierce Domain, Cyber Conflict 1986 to 2012'', which explores the idea that confrontations that have taken place within cyberspace has established a new kind of conflict.  This development is explored historically, starting in 1986 with a hacking initiative planned by the [[KGB]] to steal military plans from the U.S. in what is referred to as the ''Cuckoo's Egg Case''.&lt;ref name= Vitaliev /&gt;&lt;ref name=PMML&gt;{{cite web|title=Jason Healey: A Fierce Domain|url=http://www.pritzkermilitary.org/whats_on/pritzker-military-presents/jason-healey-fierce-domain/|work=Pritzker Military Presents|publisher=[[Pritzker Military Museum &amp; Library]]|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book received a positive reception&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital doomsters|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21580123-how-scared-should-we-be-digital-doomsters|work=[[The Economist]]|publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited|accessdate=16 April 2014|date=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been referred to as a definitive historical record of cyber conflict.&lt;ref name=CTO&gt;{{cite web|last=Gourely|first=Bob|title=A Fierce Domain: Conflict in Cyberspace, 1986 to 2012|url=http://www.ctovision.com/2013/06/a-fierce-domain-conflict-in-cyberspace-1986-to-2012/|work=CTOvision.com|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, [[Forbes Magazine]] identified Healey as one of twenty cyber policy experts to follow on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardstiennon/2014/04/07/20-cyber-policy-experts-to-follow-on-twitter/ |title=20 Cyber Policy Experts To Follow On Twitter |publisher=Forbes |date=2014-03-26 |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joan Chase Hinton''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]] name: 寒春, [[Pinyin]]: ''Hán Chūn''; 20 October 1921 – 8 June 2010) &lt;ref name="nytimes_dead"/&gt; was a [[nuclear physicist]] and one of the few women scientists who worked for the [[Manhattan Project]] in [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]. She lived in the [[People's Republic of China]] after 1949, where she and her husband [[Erwin Engst|Erwin (Sid) Engst]] participated in China's efforts at developing a socialist economy, working extensively in agriculture. She lived on a dairy farm north of [[Beijing]] before her death on June 8, 2010.

== Early life ==
On 20 October 1921, Hinton was born as Joan Chase Hinton in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].&lt;ref name="nytimes_dead"&gt;Grimes, William. June 11, 2010. {{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/science/12hinton.html | title= ''Joan Hinton, Physicist Who Chose China Over Atom Bomb, Is Dead at 88'' nytimes.com |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate= Dec 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Sebastian Hinton, was a lawyer (who also was the inventor of the [[jungle gym]]&lt;ref&gt;Hinton's original patents for the "climbing structure" are {{US patent|1471465}} filed July 22, 1920; {{US patent|1488244}} filed October 1, 1920; {{US patent|1488245}} filed October 1, 1920; and {{US patent|1488246}} filed October 24, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;); her mother, [[Carmelita Hinton]], was an educator and the founder of [[The Putney School]], an independent progressive school in [[Vermont]].

=== Family background ===
Her sister, Jean Hinton Rosner (1917–2002), was a civil rights and peace activist. Joan Hinton's great-grandfather was the mathematician [[George Boole]]; [[Ethel Lilian Voynich]], a great-aunt, was the author of ''[[The Gadfly]]'', a novel later read by millions of Soviet and Chinese readers.

== Education ==
Hinton graduated from the Putney School, where her skiing skills qualified her for a berth on the 1940 [[U.S. Ski Team]] at the [[Winter Olympic Games]], had they been held that year. She studied [[physics]] at [[Bennington College]] and graduated with a bachelor's degree in natural science from [[Bennington College]].&lt;ref name="nytimes_dead"/&gt; In 1944, Hinton earned a doctorate in Physics from [[University of Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="nytimes_dead"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth H. Howes: Their Day in the Sun: Women of the Manhattan Project&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ys0N4rFgt6UC&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;ots=Kp-c5GcP8t&amp;dq=%22joan%20hinton%22%20%20bennington&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q=%22joan%20hinton%22%20%20bennington&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
=== Nuclear scientist ===
She observed the [[Trinity test]] at [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]] and wrote about it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was like being at the bottom of an ocean of light. We were bathed in it from all directions. The light withdrew into the bomb as if the bomb sucked it up. Then it turned purple and blue and went up and up and up. We were still talking in whispers when the cloud reached the level where it was struck by the rising sunlight so it cleared out the natural clouds. We saw a cloud that was dark and red at the bottom and daylight at the top. Then suddenly the sound reached us. It was very sharp and rumbled and all the mountains were rumbling with it. We suddenly started talking out loud and felt exposed to the whole world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Joan Hinton was shocked when the US government, three weeks later, dropped [[nuclear bomb]]s on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. She left the Manhattan Project and lobbied the government in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to internationalize [[nuclear power]].

=== Moving to China ===
Her brother [[William H. Hinton]] (1919–2004) had travelled to China for the first time in 1937 and returned after the war. His book ''[[Fanshen|Fanshen: Documentary of Revolution in a Chinese Village]]'', published in 1966 after many years of obstacles, described his observations of  [[land reform]] in the communist-occupied area of Northwest China.

In March 1948, Joan Hinton travelled to Shanghai, worked for [[Soong Ching-ling]], the widow of President [[Sun Yat-sen]], and tried to establish contacts with the Chinese communists. She witnessed the communists gaining control of Beijing in 1949 and moved to [[Yan'an]], where she married Erwin Engst, who had been working in China since 1946. After 5 months living in caves in 1949 they moved to Inner Mongolia to work on a state farm, living meagerly in a stockaded village named Chunchuan without electricity or radios. At one point the village was attacked by bandits. No one knew in the USA of their whereabouts except family and  a circle of scientists. In October 1952 Joan went public in Beijing attending the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference where she denounced Hiroshima. This launched a paranoid response in the USA that she was willing to assist China developing a nuclear bomb. Questions were asked about her of her brother William during the McCarthy hearings. In May 1955 the couple and their three young children moved to a farm near [[Xi'an]] during the period of the Great Leap Forward. In April 1966 the family moved to Beijing to work as translators and editors at the beginning of the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerry kennedy, The Booles and the Hintons, Atrium Press, July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1956, Hinton finally obtained permanent residency to live in China and she chose to retain her US citizenship.&lt;ref name="shanghaiist_residentofchina"&gt;Dec 18, 2015. {{cite web|url=http://shanghaiist.com/2015/12/18/laowai_chinese.php| title= ''Laowai Chinese: The elite few foreigners who have managed to obtain permanent residency in China'' shanghaiist.com |accessdate= Dec 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29 (or in June, according to another source), 1966, Joan Hinton, Erwin Engst and two other Americans living in China—Bertha Sneck (''Shǐ Kè'' 史克, who had previously been married to Joan's brother William) and Ann Tomkins (''Tāngpǔjīnsēn'' 汤普金森)—signed a poster put up at the Foreign Experts Bureau in Beijing with the following text:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Which monsters and freaks are pulling the strings so foreigners get this kind of treatment? Foreigners working in China, no matter what class background they have, no matter what their attitude is toward the revolution, they all get the "five nots and two haves": the five nots—first: no physical labour, second: no thought reform, third: no chances of contacts with workers and peasants, fourth: no participation in class struggle, fifth: no participation in production struggle; the two haves—first: they have an exceptionally high living standard, second: they have all kinds of specialization. What kind of concept is that? This is [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]]ism, this is revisionist thinking, this is class exploitation! [...] We demand: [...] Seventh: the same living standard and the same level of Chinese staff; eighth: no specialization any more. Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A copy of the poster was shown to [[Mao Zedong]], who issued a directive that "revolutionary foreign experts and their children should be treated the same as the Chinese."

In 1972, Joan Hinton and Erwin Engst started working in agriculture again at the Beijing Red Star Commune.

In June 1987, William Hinton went to the town of [[Dazhai, Xiyang County|Dazhai]] in [[Shanxi]] province to observe the changes brought about by the reform policies, and in August 1987, Joan Hinton stayed at Dazhai as well.

In a 1996 interview with [[CNN]], after nearly 50 years in China, she stated "[we] never intended to stay in China so long, but were too caught up to leave."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;Andrea Koppel: [http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9610/01/china.us.reds/ Leftist Americans in China grieve shift to capitalism] (''CNN'', October 1st, 1996)—with photo of Sid Engst and Hinton&lt;/ref&gt; Hinton described the changes she and her husband had witnessed in China since the beginning of the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s.  They stated they "have watched their socialist dream fall apart" as much of China embraced capitalism. A 2004 [[MSNBC]] interviews noted her critical assessment of economic change as "betrayals of the socialist cause."&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;[[Catherine Rampell]]: [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5653644/ The atom spy that got away] American defector to Maoist China not happy with 56 years of progress (''NBC'', August 13th, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; She noted what she describes as a rise of exploitation in Chinese society.

Hinton lived alone following the death of her husband in 2003. Her three children moved to the United States, with Hinton noting that "They probably would have stayed if China were still socialist." Hinton retained her American citizenship, which she considered "convenient for travel." &lt;ref name="NBC" /&gt; Her son, Yang Heping (Fred Engst) moved back to Beijing in 2007 as a professor at the University of International Business and Economics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://site.uibe.edu.cn/newsenglish/html/ViewNewsInfo.aspx?sysName=TradeSchoolTeacher&amp;NewsId=265 "Yang, Heping's page in the faculty pages"] . Retrieved: 14 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2005 essay "The Second Superpower",&lt;ref&gt;Joan Hinton: [http://peace.blogsport.eu/issues/the-second-superpower The Second Superpower] (Beijing International Peace Vigil)&lt;/ref&gt; Hinton stated, "There are two opposing superpowers in the world today: the U.S. on one side, and world public opinion on the other. The first thrives on war. The second demands peace and social justice."

She remained active in the small community of expats in Beijing, protesting against the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war in Iraq]].

== Personal ==
In 1949, Hinton married [[Erwin Engst]] (1919–2003), a dairy-cattle expert, in [[Yan'an]], [[Shaanxi| Shaanxi Province]], China.&lt;ref name="nytimes_dead"/&gt; Hinton had two sons, Bill and Fred Engst and a daughter, Karen Engst.&lt;ref name="nytimes_dead"/&gt;
In 1923 Hinton's father checked himself into a clinic for treatment, but while there he committed suicide.&lt;ref name="Founding Mothers"&gt;{{cite book |title=Founding Mothers and Others: Women Educational Leaders During the Progressive Era |last=Lloyd |first=Susan McIntosh |chapter=Carmelita Chase Hinton and the Putney School |pages=111–123 |editor1-first==Alan R. |editor1-last=Sadovnik |editor2-first=Susan F. |editor2-last=Semel |publisher=Palgrave |year=2002 |isbn=0-312-29502-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, 2010, Hinton died in [[Beijing]], China. She was 88.&lt;ref name="nytimes_dead"/&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}
{{Use Indian English|date=March 2018}}
'''John Mayer''' (28 October 1929 – 9 March 2004) was an [[India]]n composer known primarily for his fusions of [[jazz]] with Indian music in the British-based group Indo-Jazz Fusions with the Jamaican-born saxophonist [[Joe Harriott]]..

Mayer was born in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[Bengal]], [[British Raj|British India]], to an [[Anglo-Indian]] father and Tamil mother, after studying with [[Phillipe Sandre]] in Calcutta and [[Melhi Mehta]] in Bombay, he won a scholarship to London's [[Royal Academy of Music]] in 1952, where he studied comparative music and religion in eastern and western cultures.

He worked as a violinist with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] (1953–58) and then with the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] (1958–65), but was also composing fusions of Hindustani classical and Western classical forms from 1952 onwards. His Violin Sonata was performed by [[Yehudi Menuhin]] in 1955.

In the 1960s he worked extensively with the [[Jamaica]]n-born jazz musician [[Joe Harriott]], with whom he formed the group Indo-Jazz Fusions, a ten-piece featuring a jazz quintet and five Indian musicians. The new incarnation of the band, called John Mayer's Indo Jazz Fusions, was revived in the 1990s by his students [[Richard Dray]], [[Will Joss]], and [[Simon Gray]], then led by Mayer himself, and continued to play live gigs—featuring his son [[Jonathan Mayer (musician)|Jonathan Mayer]] on sitar—until John's death.

The Joe Harriott-John Mayer Double Quintet composed the distinctive theme tune, "Acka Raga", for the early episodes of the BBC quiz show ''[[Ask the Family]]'', which was broadcast between 1967 and 1984. The theme featured Mayer on sitar.

From 1989 onwards, Mayer, who lived in north London, taught composition at [[Birmingham Conservatoire]] where he introduced the BMus Indian music course in 1997.
In March 2004, Mayer was hit by a car in North London and fatally injured. He was 74.

[[Joseph Smith]] (1805–1844), the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], secretly taught and practiced [[plural marriage|polygamy]] during his ministry, and married multiple women during his lifetime. Smith and some of the leading [[Quorum (Latter Day Saints)|quorums]] of [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|his church]] publicly denied he taught or practiced it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patriot.lib.byu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2FNCMP1820-1846&amp;CISOPTR=8375&amp;REC=10&amp;CISOBOX=Polygamy bound edition]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}—[http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n03.htm "Notice"], ''[[Times and Seasons]]'', '''5'''(3) (1 February 1844): 423: "As we have lately been credibly informed, that an Elder of the Church of Jesus Christ, of Latter-day Saints, by the name of Hiram Brown, has been preaching Polygamy, and other false and corrupt doctrines, in the county of Lapeer, state of Michigan."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Roberts |first= B.

In 1852, leaders of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) acknowledged that Smith had practiced plural marriage and produced a written [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] of Smith's that authorizes its practice. Smith's son [[Joseph Smith III]], his lawful widow [[Emma Smith]], and most members of the [[Community of Christ|Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (RLDS Church) attempted for years to refute the evidence of plural marriages. They pointed to the historical record that Joseph Smith publicly opposed the practice of polygamy;&lt;ref name="MS-1944-01"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitmer|1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Times and Seasons]]'' '''5''':[http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n06.htm 474].&lt;/ref&gt; the suggestion of the RLDS Church was that the practice of Mormon polygamy began in Utah under the leadership of [[Brigham Young]].

The first publication of a list of women alleged to be Smith's plural wives was in 1887, by [[Andrew Jenson]], an assistant church historian of the LDS Church. It included 27 women besides [[Emma Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Jenson, A. ''Historical Record'' '''6''' [May 1887]: 233–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are 49 women on this list.  However, historians disagree as to the number and identity of the plural wives which Smith had. Various scholars and historians, including [[Fawn M. Brodie]], [[George D. Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2010|p=621}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Todd Compton]], have attempted to identify the women who married Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discrepancy is created by the lack of documents to support some of the alleged marriages. As Compton has stated, for many of these marriages, "absolutely nothing is known of [the] marriage after the ceremony."&lt;ref&gt;[http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=review&amp;id=290 Maxwell Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622114353/http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=review&amp;id=290 |date=2008-06-22 }}, Brigham Young University.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from his marriage to Emma, Smith's marriages were not solemnized under any civil authority and were therefore solely religious unions.

Compton also notes that nineteenth-century Mormons in [[Utah Territory]], including [[Benjamin F. Johnson]], Heber C. Kimball and [[Andrew Jenson]], and former Mormons Chauncey Webb and [[Ann Eliza Young|Ann Eliza Webb Young]], regarded the Smith–Alger relationship as a marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Compton|1997|pp=25–32.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Lawrence Foster asserts a claim that later Mormons may have falsely assumed there was a marriage where there was only a sexual relationship: he views the marriage of Alger to Smith as a "debatable supposition" rather than "established fact".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Foster, [http://www.signaturebooks.com/reviews/insacred.htm Review of ''In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith''"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060323034213/http://www.signaturebooks.com/reviews/insacred.htm |date=2006-03-23 }}, ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' '''33''' (spring 2001): 184–86.&lt;/ref&gt; As Richard Bushman has noted, Smith "never denied a relationship with Alger, but insisted it was not adulterous. He wanted it on record that he had never confessed to such a sin."&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, pg. 325&lt;/ref&gt; The best statement Smith could obtain from Cowdery was an affirmation that Smith had never acknowledged himself to have been guilty of adultery. "That", wrote Bushman, "was all Joseph wanted: an admission that he had not termed the Alger affair adulterous." After Smith's death, when Alger's brother asked her about her relationship with Smith, she replied, "That is all a matter of my own. And I have nothing to communicate."&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, pg 327&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This marriage was [[polyandrous]], as Lucinda lived with her husband George Washington Harris until about 1853.

He said I was the first woman God commanded him to take as a plural wife. … In 1834 he was commanded to take me for a Wife …. [In 1842 I] went forward and was sealed to him. Brigham Young performed the sealing … for time, and all Eternity. I did just as Joseph told me to do".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Meanwhile, in 1835 she married another man, Adam Lightner a non-Mormon.  They had two children and she was pregnant with her third at the time she was sealed to Joseph Smith in 1842. “I went forward and was sealed to him. Brigham Young performed the sealing, and Heber C. Kimball the blessing."  After the sealing she continued to live with her first husband Adam.  That summer they moved fifteen miles away at Pontoosuc.  Following the death of Joseph Smith Mary went briefly back to Nauvoo. In the fall of 1844 Brigham Young and Heber Kimball offered themselves to Smith's widows as proxy husbands and Mary accepted Young's proposal. She was sealed to him for time in a proxy marriage on May 22, 1845: "I was also sealed to B Young as proxy for Joseph," she wrote, though she continued to live with Adam.

When Brigham Young and the church left Nauvoo to emigrate to Utah, Mary and Adam stayed behind.  They eventually moved to Utah 17 years later settling in the town of Minersville 217 miles from Salt Lake City, the seat of the church and Brigham Young.  In her later years she would often supplicate the church for monetary assistance appealing to them on the basis of her connection with Joseph and Brigham.&lt;ref&gt;Compton 1997, pg.205-222&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Elizabeth and her sister Caroline were instrumental in salvaging printed pages of the [[Book of Commandments]] when the printing press was destroyed by a mob on July 20, 1833.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Carter | first = Kate | title = Our Pioneer Heritage | publisher = Daughters of Utah Pioneers | year=  1962 | location = Salt Lake City, UT | pages = 308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
Bhatt was born to [[Nanabhai Bhatt]] and Shirin Mohammad Ali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news-interviews/My-wife-and-my-audience-both-took-time-to-understand-me-Emraan-Hashmi/articleshow/20603710.cms|title=My wife and my audience, both took time to understand me: Emraan Hashmi - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhatt's father was a [[Hindu]] [[Brahmin]] and his mother was a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] [[Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Purnima|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0691010/|work=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I have great reverence for women: Mahesh Bhatt|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-14/news-interviews/36311776_1_mother-mary-mahesh-bhatt-shivaji-park|work=01/18/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mahesh Bhatt's article about Ramzan, Ramadan|url=http://ramadanexclusive.blogspot.in/2012/07/mahesh-bhatts-article-about-ramzan.html|accessdate=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his siblings is the Indian film producer [[Mukesh Bhatt]]. Mahesh Bhatt did his schooling from [[Don Bosco High School, Matunga]]. While still in school, Bhatt started summer jobs to earn money, while also making product advertisements. He was introduced to film director [[Raj Khosla]] through acquaintances. Bhatt thus started as assistant director to Khosla. Bhatt married his first wife Kiran (born Lorraine Bright) whom he had met while still a student. His romance with her was the inspiration for his film ''[[Aashiqui]]''.&lt;ref name=toi_saaransh/&gt;  Bhatt and Kiran had two children ([[Pooja Bhatt]] and [[Rahul Bhatt]]) but his marriage stumbled following the difficulties of his early career. Bhatt later fell in love with actress [[Soni Razdan]] and married her.&lt;ref name=toi_saaransh/&gt; Bhatt and Soni had two daughters Shaheen Bhatt and [[Alia Bhatt]].

==Mainstream==
At the age 26, Bhatt made his debut as a director with the film ''[[Manzilein Aur Bhi Hain]]'' in 1974. His 1979 ''[[Lahu Ke Do Rang (1979 film)|Lahu Ke Do Rang]]'', starring [[Shabana Azmi]] and [[Vinod Khanna]] in lead roles, won two [[Filmfare Awards]] in 1980:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151285/awards |title=Lahu Ke Do Rang Awards |publisher=''[[IMDB]]'' |accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen (actress)|Helen]] received her first Filmfare as [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award|Best Supporting Actress]] and Madhukar Shinde won it for [[Filmfare Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]]. The film did "above average" at the box office.&lt;ref name=Boxoffice1979&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=185&amp;catName=MTk3OQ== |title=Box Office 1979 |publisher=Boxofficeindia.com |accessdate=21 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020102901/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=185&amp;catName=MTk3OQ== |archivedate=20 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was noticed and received great critical acclaim with art film ''[[Arth (film)|Arth]]'' (1982), when he turned to his personal life for inspiration but doubt persists as to whether it is an original film. Later, he made many more films taking insights from his personal life wherein he highlighted personal narratives ranging from out-of-wedlock birth, to extramarital affair, and created critically acclaimed works such as ''[[Janam (1985 film)|Janam]]'' (1985) and ''[[Saaransh]]'' (1984),  an exploration of an old couple's anxieties in a universe governed by arbitrary violence,  (1986).

Bhatt had one of his biggest releases with musical romance film ''[[Aashiqui]]'' (1990), in collaboration with [[Super Cassettes Industries T-Series|T-Series]]. The film launched [[Rahul Roy]], [[Anu Agarwal]] and [[Deepak Tijori]] in the lead roles and became a major commercial success due to the hugely popular soundtrack by [[Nadeem-Shravan]], which catapulted the music director duo into stardom. He launched his daughter [[Pooja Bhatt]] as a lead actress opposite [[Aamir Khan]] in ''[[Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahin]]'' (1991). The film was a commercial success and hugely acclaimed for its soundtrack. Bhatt's directorial ''[[Saathi (1991 film)|Saathi]]'' (1991) was the only major success for [[Aditya Pancholi]] as a lead actor, thus giving a boost to his career. It was the biggest hit of the actor's career.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Bhatt's biggest release during that time was  ''[[Sir (film)|Sir]]'' (1993). The film launched [[Atul Agnihotri]] opposite Pooja Bhatt and [[Naseeruddin Shah]] was featured in the title role of an aspiring and dedicated teacher. The film was a commercial success and gained critical acclaim for Bhatt's direction and the acting of Shah, Pooja, Agnihotri and [[Paresh Rawal]].

'''''Mary Kay and Johnny''''' is an American [[situation comedy]] starring real-life married couple [[Mary Kay Stearns|Mary Kay]] and [[Johnny Stearns]]. It was the first sitcom broadcast on a [[Television network|network television]] in the [[United States]]. ''Mary Kay and Johnny'' initially aired [[Live television|live]] on the [[DuMont Television Network]] before moving to [[CBS]] and then [[NBC]].

==Format==
Plots centered around a bank employee and his "zany, but not dumb" wife and the problems that they encountered.&lt;ref name="laz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karol|first1=Michael|title=Lucy A to Z: The Lucille Ball Encyclopedia|date=2004|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9780595752133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoABABSnX7oC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;dq=%22Mary+Kay+and+Johnny%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxrPHZzrfWAhWoq1QKHTc2A34Q6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mary%20Kay%20and%20Johnny%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the activity occurred in the couple's apartment in Greenwich Village.&lt;ref name=laz/&gt;

A review in the March 6, 1948, issue of the trade publication ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' began, "This program comes close to being a model tele[vision] show. In detailing the adventures, mainly domestic, of a young married couple, Johnny and Mary Kay Stearns have come up with charming and fresh material, which always takes into consideration that there are cameras taking everything in."&lt;ref name=bb&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chase|first1=Sam|title=Mary Kay and Johnny|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Billboard-IDX/IDX/40s/1948/Billboard%201948-03-06-OCR-Page-0038.pdf|accessdate=22 September 2017|work=Billboard|date=March 6, 1948|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the review, however, the author wrote, "At times the show got just a bit too cute" with the female star squealing too much and the story falling into familiar family sitcom patterns.&lt;ref name=bb/&gt;

==Cast==
In addition to the Stearnses, the cast included their son, Christopher Stearns, as himself. Mary Kay's mother was played by Nydia Westman, and Johnny's friend Howie was played by Howard Thomas. Jim Stevenson was the announcer.&lt;ref name="etvs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Terrace|first1=Vincent|title=Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010|date=2011|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-6477-7|page=661|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Broadcast history==
The first 15-minute episode debuted on the [[DuMont Television Network]] on Tuesday, November 18, 1947.&lt;ref name="ill"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landay|first1=Lori|title=I Love Lucy|date=2010|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=Michigan, Detroit|isbn=081433573X|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwX7qqzVeF0C&amp;pg=PT79&amp;dq=%22Mary+Kay+and+Johnny%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxrPHZzrfWAhWoq1QKHTc2A34Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mary%20Kay%20and%20Johnny%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stearnses created and wrote all the scripts. The program was broadcast live, most of the action taking place on a set representing the [[New York City]] apartment of the title characters, a young married couple. 

''Mary Kay and Johnny'' was the first program to show a couple sharing a bed, and the first series to show a woman's pregnancy on television:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/marykay.htm snopes.com/radiotv Snopes.com: "Early to Bed"]&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Kay became pregnant in 1948 and after unsuccessfully trying to hide her pregnancy, the producers wrote it into the show. On December 31, 1948, the Stearns' weeks-old son Christopher appeared on the show and became a character.

After a year on DuMont, the show moved to [[CBS]] for half a year, much of the time being broadcast every weeknight, then ran for another year each Saturday night on [[NBC]], where it debuted on October 10, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawes|first1=William|title=Live Television Drama, 1946–1951|date=2001|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476608495|page=245|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l8z-CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=%22Mary+Kay+and+Johnny%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxrPHZzrfWAhWoq1QKHTc2A34Q6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mary%20Kay%20and%20Johnny%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It broadcast the final episode on March 11, 1950.

==Viewership==
At a time when there were no TV ratings (the [[A.C. Nielsen Co.|A.C. Nielsen Company]] would not begin measuring TV ratings until 1950), [[Anacin]] decided to take a chance and sponsor the show.  This decision worried the advertising executives at Anacin, who thought that they might be wasting money by sponsoring a show with a sparse audience.  A simple, non-scientific scheme to gauge the size of the audience was hatched.  During one commercial spot, Anacin offered a free pocket mirror to the first 200 viewers who wrote in requesting one.  As a precaution, they purchased a total of 400 mirrors in case the audience was twice as large as they expected.  Although the free mirror was offered only during that one spot, Anacin received nearly 9000 requests for mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Mitz, Rick. ''The Great TV Sitcom Book (Expanded Edition)''. New York, NY: Perigee Books - Putnam Publishing Co., 1983, p9.  Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episode status==
Before 1948, ''Mary Kay and Johnny'' was broadcast live and not recorded. In early 1948, still broadcast live, the show was also recorded on [[kinescope]]s so that it could be shown, with some delay, on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. The entire series from then until 1950 was recorded in this way. Many episodes survived in full as late as 1975,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} when DuMont's corporate successor, [[Metromedia]], [[List of surviving DuMont Television Network broadcasts|disposed of what was left of the DuMont archive]] in the East River.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Ed McMahon, David C. Fisher, in their book ''When Television Was Young: The Inside Story with Memories by Legends of the Small Screen'', wrote, "Unfortunately, these kinescopes survived only until the 1970s when ABC dumped all the old DuMont programs into the New York Bay and CBS trashed its own old kinescopes."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wtwy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMahon|first1=Ed|last2=Fisher|first2=David C.|title=When Television Was Young: The Inside Story with Memories by Legends of the Small Screen|date=2007|publisher=Thomas Nelson Inc|isbn=9781418578411|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2uN_AkdwAioC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=%22Mary+Kay+and+Johnny%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxrPHZzrfWAhWoq1QKHTc2A34Q6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mary%20Kay%20and%20Johnny%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fate of the NBC episodes is unknown. Fragments of the show's last few episodes survive, most on [[16 mm film|16-mm film]]; these are not commercially available, though [[TV Land]] used a clip in an episode of ''[[Inside TV Land]]'' called "Taboo TV".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/tv-tame-special-examines-old-taboos-article-1.504748#ixzz2Te0S0Lec|title=When TV Was Tame: Special examines old taboos|last=Bianculli|first=David|date=November 14, 2002|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paley Center for Media]] has one 1949 episode in its collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=mary+kay&amp;f=all&amp;c=tv&amp;advanced=1&amp;p=1&amp;item=T:13423 Entry for June 13th, 1949 episode at The Paley Center for Media website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FML names-2.png|thumb|300px|First/given, middle, and last/family/surname diagram with [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]] as example. This shows a structure typical for English-speaking cultures (and some others). Other cultures use other structures for full names.]]
In several cultures, a '''middle name''' is a portion of a [[personal name]] that is written between the person's [[given name]] and their [[surname]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/middle%20name |title=Middle name - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person may be given a middle name regardless of whether it's necessary to distinguish them from other people with the same given name and surname. In cultures where a given name is expected to precede the surname, additional names are likely to be placed after the given name and before the surname,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/381383/middle-name |title=middle name (language) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus called middle names. In English-speaking American culture, that term is often applied (arguably mistakenly) to names occupying that position even if the bearer would insist that that name is being mistakenly called a "middle name", and is actually (to mention several types of common cases): 
* part of a two-word given name (e.g. ''[[Mary Anne]]'', about [[Mary Anne Clarke]], and "[[Joe Bob Briggs]]"), 
* a [[maiden name]] (e.g. [[Hillary Clinton|Rodham]]), 
* a [[patronymic]] (e.g. [[Nikita Khrushchev|Sergeyevich]]), 
* a [[baptismal name]] (e.g. "Christopher" invoking [[Saint Christopher]]), or
* a maternal [[surname]] (such as in Portuguese and Brazilian names).
 
In the [[United States]], such names are specifically referred to as middle names; in most other countries, as far as they are given names and not, for example, [[patronymic]]s, they would simply be regarded as second, third etc. given names. In the U.S., the "middle name" is often [[abbreviated]] to the '''middle initial''' (e.g. Mary Lee Bianchi becomes Mary L. Bianchi, which is usually standard for [[signature]]s{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}) or omitted entirely in everyday use (e.g. just Mary Bianchi). An individual may have more than one middle name, or none. In the United Kingdom, for comparison, she would usually be referred to as either Mary Bianchi, M. L. Bianchi or Mary Lee Bianchi, or she may choose Lee Bianchi, and informally there may be familiar shortenings.

It is debatable how long multiple given names have existed in English-speaking countries, but it is certain that among royalty and aristocracy the practice existed by the late 17th century (and possibly earlier), as exemplified in the name of the Stuart pretender [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (1688–1766).

Despite their relatively long existence in North America, the phrase "middle name" was not recorded until 1835, in the periodical ''[[Harvardiana]]''.

The use of multiple middle names has been somewhat impeded recently{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} by the increased use of [[software|computer]] [[database]]s that occasionally allow for only a single middle name or more commonly a middle initial in storing personal records, effectively preventing people with multiple middle names from being listed in such [[databases]] under their full name. This is worsened by longer compound names, like [[María del Pilar Pereyra]] or [[María de las Nieves García]].

The abbreviation "N.M.N." (no middle name) or "N.M.I." (no middle initial), with or without periods, is sometimes used in formal documents in the United States, where a middle initial or name is expected but the person does not have one. The middle name can also be a maiden name.

Since 1905, "middle name" has also developed a figurative usage meaning a notable or outstanding attribute of a person, as in the phrase "discretion is my middle name."

==English==
In countries that primarily speak English—such as [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United States]], and the [[United Kingdom]]—the forename of a relative is sometimes used as one's middle name to honor familial heritage.&lt;ref name=genfiles&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.genfiles.com/articles/middle-names/ | title=The Use of Middle Names| date=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases in the United States, however, a person's middle name has little or no lineage-related context, and is used instead to honor close family friends or notable public figures.&lt;ref name=genfiles/&gt;

In the United States, those who choose to be known primarily by their middle name may abbreviate their first name as an [[initial]], e.g. [[J. Edgar Hoover]] (John Edgar Hoover). Others simply omit the first name, like [[Woodrow Wilson]] (Thomas Woodrow Wilson). A rare case of an individual being given only an initial as a middle name, with the initial not explicitly standing for anything, was [[Harry S. Truman]]. (He once told reporters—apparently at odds with his own practice—that the S should thus not be followed by period.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/speriod.htm | title=Truman: The "S" Period}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than two given names are fairly common. In England they are traditionally more common among the "upper classes" and "middle classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nameberry.com/blog/british-baby-names-two-middle-names | title=British Baby Names: Two middle names| date=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[W.E.B. Du Bois]], [[George H. W. Bush]].

Middle names can also be used as first names. Major examples are [[Paul McCartney]], [[Mitt Romney]], [[Dakota Fanning]], [[Elle Fanning]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Jonathan Demme]], [[Riley Keough]], [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Hayley Orrantia]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Meghan Markle]], [[Rihanna]], [[Scott Chandler (American football)|Scott Chandler]], [[Nomar Garciaparra]], [[Bill Mumy]], [[Roger Waters]] and [[Jim Acosta]].

=== Chinese ===
{{Further|Chinese name|Generation name|Courtesy name|Art name}}
Traditionally, Chinese names consisted of three characters—the surname, followed by a two-character given name (''ming''), which is not separated into a first and middle name in usage.  Two-character given names follow a naming tradition in which the first character of the given name (and thus the second character in the three-character full name) indicates the person's generation in his/her family.  For example, the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] has the given name ''Yinzhen'' (胤禛) while his brothers' names all begin with the character "Yin" (胤).  His sons' and nephews' given names all begin with the character ''Hong'' (弘). Traditionally, the list of generational names may be decided many generations in advance by the ancestors.  In such naming systems, the de facto given name is the last character of a person's full name. Even if that was the case most of the time, sometimes the person's given name is the middle character and not the last. A three-character name is both patriarchal and hierarchical, as it would inform of a person's belonging and rank within a family. During the [[One-child_policy|One-child Policy]], there was no need for a generation name as there was only one child in each generation. Many names in Mainland China were shortened to two-characters during this time, and there are many adults with shorter names remnant from this era. This would not be found in Taiwan or Hong Kong.

A fading Chinese tradition is to use a [[courtesy name]], called ''zì'' (字) in place of a male's given name in adulthood.  Traditionally ''zì'' is given by one's father upon reaching the age of maturity at 20 years old.  This name is intended for use in formal situations and formal writing and confers a status of adulthood and respect.  Like the ''ming'', the ''zì'' is composed of two characters which usually reflect the meaning of the ''ming''.  Prior to the 20th century, sinicized Koreans, Vietnamese, and Japanese were also referred to by their ''zì''.  An alternative courtesy name is the ''hào'' ({{zh|s=号|t=號|p=hào|labels=no}}; Japanese gō; Korean: ho; Vietnamese: hiệu), which usually referred to as the pseudonym. A ''hào'' was usually self-chosen and it was possible to have more than one. It had no connection with the bearer's ''míng'' or ''zì''; rather it was often a personal choice and may have reflected a personal belief or philosophy. Chinese adults may more frequently use the ''hào'' to refer to themselves. The ''zì'' or ''hào'' can be used independently of the given name and of each other, but the given name is almost always used with the family name in official situations.

Some [[Chinese American]]s move their Chinese given name ([[Romanization of Chinese|transliterated]] into the [[Latin alphabet]]) to the middle name position and use an English first name, e.g. [[James Soong|James Chu-yu Soong]], [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Chih-Yuan Yang]], and [[Michelle Kwan|Michelle Wingshan Kwan]]. The Chinese given name usually has two characters which are usually combined into a single middle name for better organizational purposes, especially with [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] names, such as [[Bruce Lee]]'s middle name, Junfan. There are also some new immigrants whose Chinese given names are their first names followed by English middle names.

The practice of taking English and Chinese given names is also common in [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Taiwan]]. However, rather than placing the Chinese given name between the English given name and the family name, it is commonly placed after the family name in these places. Under such a system, Bruce Junfan Lee would have been Bruce Lee Junfan. This practice is consistent with both the Western convention of putting the given name before the family name and the Chinese convention of putting the given name after the family name.

==Scandinavia==
In [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], the term middle name refers to names that are originally surnames, but not part of the last name of the name bearer. The term middle name does not refer to additional given names, which are instead referred to as given names. A middle name could be e.g. one's mother's maiden name or the last name of another recent ancestor (for instance a grandparent). One can have several middle names, but it is unusual to have more than one or two. In law, middle names have a separate status. In practice, their status is similar to that of additional given names, and middle names are often omitted in everyday use, just like a person with 3 or 4 given names would only use one of them in most situations. The historical purpose of middle names is to honour some related family or person, a godparent, or even a completely unrelated person, such as a locally or nationally prominent figure. Until the 19th century, it was not unusual to have the last name of a godparent as one's middle name, even when the godparent was not a blood relative. This practice, and the use of middle names in general, however, was mostly limited to the bourgeois class and the nobility, and was seldom seen among common people. In the 20th century, the use of middle names, especially one's mother's maiden name, was more widely adopted, although it is by no means mandatory. There are few set rules for how names are constructed today; people are required to have one given name and one family name, but can have as many additional given names and middle names as they like.

In the example [[Carl Viggo Manthey Lange]], the names Carl and Viggo are given names, while Manthey is a middle name and Lange is the family name. Manthey is his mother's maiden name. Unless his full name is used, he is correctly referred to as Mr. Lange, not as Mr. Manthey Lange. Carl Viggo Manthey Lange has a name typical of the Norwegian bourgeois class, with both his family name and his middle name being of foreign origin and being recognised surnames. Most Norwegians and Danes of the working class and peasant class used [[patronymic]]s until the 19th century, when permanent family names became mandatory, first in Denmark in the early 19th century and then in Norway around 1900. A middle name is usually a recognised surname and not a patronymic. One reason middle names have become popular in the 20th century, particularly in Denmark, is that most Danish surnames originated as patronymics and are shared by a large number of people. The use of middle names in modern times serves to differentiate them from other people. For example, Danish politician [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]] has some of the most common given and last names in Denmark (Lars and Rasmussen); his mother's maiden name is the slightly more unusual name Løkke, derived from a small agricultural property, so he uses it as a middle name, which differentiates him from other people named Lars Rasmussen.

In [[Sweden]], the position is much the same as in Denmark. Middle names were inaugurated in the previous Name Act of 1963, then called "tilläggsnamn" (additional name), and are called "mellannamn" (middle name) as of the present Name Act of 1983. However, it had previously been more common to join e.g. the last names of both of a child's parents, or for a married woman to join her maiden name and the husband's last name, as a double name with a hyphen; and large portions of the Swedish population have not adapted to the official system to this day, i.e. for almost 50 years. People often use a hyphen between their middle name and last name themselves, and/or are spelled that way by other people and by mass media.

Furthermore, when the term middle name was introduced in Swedish ("mellannamn") the word was assumed by many to mean the additional given names (apart from the "name of address" (''tilltalsnamn'')), so since 1983 the word is being used more and more in this, officially, erratic meaning.

Occasionally, Scandinavians choose to use their middle name as their surname in everyday life. So [[Gottfrid Svartholm|Per Gottfrid Svartholm Warg]] has Per and Gottfrid as his given names, where Gottfrid, not Per, is his name of address, Svartholm as his middle name and Warg as his last name, but in practice he uses Svartholm as a surname. This usage, however, is unofficial. Historically, a middle name could become part of a double-barreled surname (family name) and hence cease to be a middle name, especially if used for several generations. There are many family names of this kind, which contributes to the confusion about middle names that shall not be hyphenated. Some of these double-barreled surnames are combined with a hyphen, while others are not, so a double surname without a hyphen can sometimes be indistinguishable from a middle name followed by a family name.

In Scandinavia, there is no limit on how many given names one can have. Given names have never been referred to as middle names, apart from many in Sweden believing so, as mentioned above. The use of more than two or three given names is generally associated with the upper class. The first given name is not necessarily the name of address. For the sake of completeness, Swedish forms often ask people to fill in all their given names and to indicate which one is their "name of address" (''tilltalsnamn'').

==Southeast Asia==

===Vietnam===

{{Further|Vietnamese name}}

Traditional middle names in Vietnamese are "Văn" for male names and "Thị" for female names. However, modern Vietnamese do not consider these to be attractive names, especially "Thị". Therefore, nowadays popular middle names also are popular first names. Middle names play an important role in Vietnamese full names; they could help creating beautiful names when combine with first names, distinguishing people who have the same first name (there are many common last names in Vietnam), and also distinguishing the gender of the names ([[unisex name]]s are used widely in Vietnam). Hence, Vietnamese rarely abbreviate their middle names.

===Philippines===
{{further information|Filipino name}}

For Filipinos, the middle name is usually the maternal surname, which is the maiden surname of a person's mother. The use of the maternal surname as middle name is from American influence, where Filipinos adopted English naming customs, when they once used [[Spanish naming customs]], that used two surnames (paternal and maternal) joined with the particle ''y'' (or ''e'', before "i"), which remains in use but became restricted to  very formal purposes, police records and legal proceedings. In the Spanish naming system, the middle name corresponds to the maternal surname. The middle name (or the maternal surname) is usually being abbreviated to a middle initial. Thus, a person with the full name ''Juan Santos Macaraig'', with ''Santos'' the middle name in the present order, may become ''Juan S. Macaraig'' with the middle name abbreviated, and ''Juan Macaraig y Santos'' in the Spanish system, such as those used in names on police records, especially those seen on name placards held by a convicted person on official [[mug shot]]s. The Philippine system, using "given name-middle name-surname" order (or "Christian name-mother's surname-father's surname") coincidentally follows the [[Portuguese name|Portuguese]] naming system that uses two surnames, the first being maternal and the second being paternal.

But, the maternal surname may not be the middle name at some cases. It may be a second given name, like what the term really means, as in ''[[Jose P.  Laurel]]'', where "P." (a middle initial)  corresponds to ''Paciano''.

In illegitimate children, the middle name is the maiden surname of the mother, and the middle name (maternal surname) of the mother as surname, but the surname become of the father's upon legal and administrative acknowledgement by his/her father. Children of a single father takes no middle name, even when the mother's identity is known. 

To illustrate that, the daughter of an unmarried couple named ''Ana Cristina dela Cruz Manansala'' and ''Jose Maria Panganiban Lozada'', named '"Maria Cristina'", will be named ''Maria Cristina Manansala dela Cruz'' (or ''Ma. Cristina M. dela Cruz''), with Ana Cristina's middle name,  ''dela Cruz'', as surname. But once Jose Maria wants to acknowledge her as his child legally and administratively, Maria Cristina will take the surname ''Lozada'', but keep the maternal surmame ''Manansala'' as middle name, thus, ''Maria Cristina Manansala Lozada'' (or ''Ma. Cristina M. Lozada''). As the daughter of only Jose Maria, Maria Cristina will be rather called ''Maria Cristina Lozada'' or ''Ma. Cristina Lozada'', even when the mother is known.

In married women, the middle name usually corresponds to the maiden surname, but on professional society, women usually add the husband's surname after their maiden name, keeping the maternal surname. A married woman may decline taking the husband's surname and keep her maiden name as no Philippine law compels women to take her husband's surname. Thus, a woman named ''Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco'' (or ''Ma. Concepcion P. Limchauco''), once marrying ''Juan Pablo Sanchez Marasigan'' (or ''Juan Pablo S. Marasigan'') may take the name ''Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco-Marasigan'' (or ''Ma. Concepcion P.  Limchauco-Marasigan''), maintaining the maternal surname ''Perez'', ''Maria Concepcion Limchauco Marasigan'' (or ''Ma. Concepcion L. Marasigan''), taking the maiden surname ''Limchauco'' as middle name and ''Marasigan'' as married surname, or keep her maiden names, remaining ''Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco'' upon marriage.

== Latin America ==
In Argentina, most people have a middle name. According to a study, approximately 9 out of 10 Argentines born in 2010 had a middle name given to them. It used to be even more common in the past, as it is an old tradition. It's very common to use the name of a grandparent as middle name. It is termed "segundo nombre" (lit. second name). However, its widespread use is slowly shrinking due to the influence of neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/segundo-nombre-pasa-moda-usa-poner-solo_0_ryME5BGvb.html | title=El segundo nombre pasa de moda: Se usa poner sólo uno}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Actually, most of south-american, especially Hispanic citizens are acquainted with the use of compound given names, such as Maria + (second given name) or Juan + (given name), among others. This is often considered a useful way of distinguishing from similar or identical names considering that Spanish-derived surnames are strikingly common in some cultural regions (e.g. Luis Fernandez can be better distinguished if arranged as Luis Antonio Fernandez, José Luis Fernandez, Luis Eduardo Fernandez, etc.).

He was the leader of an offshoot of the [[Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia]] (ASALA) in the 1980s and the most celebrated commander during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] in the early 1990s.{{sfn|de Waal|2013|p=341}}

An [[Armenian-American]], Melkonian left the United States and arrived in Iran in 1978 during the beginning of the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Revolution]], taking part in demonstrations against the [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi|Shah]]. Following the collapse of the Shah's monarchy, he traveled to Lebanon during the height of the civil war and served in an Armenian militia group in the [[Beirut]] suburb of [[Bourj Hammoud]]. In ASALA, he took part in the assassinations of several Turkish diplomats in Europe during the early to mid-1980s. He planned the [[1981 Turkish consulate attack in Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dugan|first1=Laura|last2=Huang|first2=Julie Y.|last3=LaFree|first3=Gary|last4=McCauley|first4=Clark|title=Sudden desistance from terrorism: The Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia and the Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide|journal=Dynamics of Asymmetric Conflict|date=2008|volume=1|issue=3|page=237|url=https://ccjs.umd.edu/sites/ccjs.umd.edu/files/pubs/Dugan%20et%20al%20Assymetric%20Conflict.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later arrested and sent to prison in France. In 1989, he was released and in the following year, acquired a visa to travel to Armenia.

Melkonian had no prior service record in any country's army before being placed in command of an estimated 4,000 men in the Nagorno-Karabakh War.{{sfn|Melkonian|2005|p=x}} He had largely built his military experience beginning from the late 1970s and 1980s, when he fought in Lebanon with ASALA. Melkonian fought against various factions in the [[Lebanese Civil War]] and against the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] in the [[1982 Lebanon War|1982 war]].

Melkonian carried several aliases over his career and was known as '''Avo''' to the troops under his command in Nagorno-Karabakh. The last years of his life were spent fighting with the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army]].&lt;ref name="Croissant, Michael P. 1998"&gt;Croissant, Michael P. (1998).

==Early life==

===Youth===
Melkonian was born on November 25, 1957 at Visalia Municipal Hospital in [[Visalia, California|Visalia]], [[California]] to Charles (1918−2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steinberg|first1=Jim|title=Armenian Hero's Father Dies At 88|url=http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/showthread.php?63043-Fresno-Armenian-Hero-s-Father-Dies-At-88|work=[[The Fresno Bee]]|date=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zabel Melkonian (1920−2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Commander Monte Melkonian's mother dies at 92|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/136669/|agency=[[PanARMENIAN.Net]]|date=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the third of four children born to a self-employed cabinetmaker and an elementary-school teacher.{{sfn|Melkonian|2005|p=4}} By all accounts, Melkonian was described as an all-American child who joined the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] and was a pitcher in [[Little League]] baseball.&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt; Melkonian's parents rarely talked about their Armenian heritage with their children, often referring to the place of their ancestors as the "Old Country." His interest in his background only sparked at the age of eleven, when his family went on a year-long trip to [[Europe]] in 1969.

While taking Spanish language courses in Spain, his teacher had posed him the question of where he was from. Dissatisfied with Melkonian's answer of "California", the teacher rephrased the question by asking "where did your ''ancestors'' come from?" His brother Markar Melkonian remarked that "her image of us was not at all like our image of ourselves. She did not view us as the Americans we had always assumed we were." From this moment on, for days and months to come, Markar continues, "Monte pondered [their teacher Señorita] Blanca's question ''Where are you from?''"{{sfn|Melkonian|2005|p=10-12}}

In the spring of that year, the family also traveled across [[Turkey]] to visit the town of [[Merzifon]], where Melkonian's maternal grandparents were from. Merzifon's population at the time was 23,475 but was almost completely devoid of its once 17,000-strong Armenian population that was wiped out during the [[Armenian Genocide]] in 1915. They did find one Armenian family of the three that was living in the town, however, Melkonian soon learned that the only reason this was so, was because the head of the family in 1915 had exchanged the safety of his family in return for identifying all the Armenians in the town to Turkish authorities during the genocide.{{sfn|Melkonian|2005|pp=12-18}} Monte would later confide to his wife that "he was never the same after that visit....He saw the place that had been lost."&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt;

===Education===
Upon his return to California Monte returned to his education. In high school, he was exceeding all standards and having a hard time finding new academic challenges. Instead of graduating high school early, as was suggested by his principal, Monte found an alternative thanks to his father: a study abroad program in East Asia. At the age of 15 Monte traveled to Japan for a new chapter in his young life, namely to study martial arts and [[Japanese language]].{{sfn|Zurcher|2009|page=176}} While there he began making money teaching English which helped finance his travels through several Southeast Asian countries. This introduced him to several new cultures, new philosophies, new languages, and in several cases, like his travels through [[Vietnam]] (just before the North would defeat the South{{sfn|Zurcher|2009|page=176}}), new skills that would become immensely valuable in his later life as a soldier.{{sfn|Melkonian|2005|p=344}} Returning to the United States, he graduated from high school and entered the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with Regents Scholarship, majoring in [[ancient Asian history]] and [[Archeology]]. In 1978 he helped to organize an exhibition of Armenian cultural artifacts at one of the university's libraries. The section of the exhibit dealing with the 1915-23 genocide was removed by university authorities, at the request of the [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[consul (representative)|consul]] general in [[San Francisco]]. The display that was removed was eventually reinstalled following a campus protest movement. Monte eventually completed his undergrad work in under three years. Upon graduating, he was accepted into the archeology graduate program at the [[University of Oxford]]. However, Monte chose to forgo this opportunity, and instead chose to begin his lifelong struggle for the Armenian Cause.{{sfn|Melkonian|2005|p=344}}

==Departure from home==

===Teaching in Iran===
After graduating from U.C. Berkeley in the spring of 1978, Monte traveled to [[Iran]], where he taught English and participated in the movement to [[Iranian Revolution|overthrow the Shah]]. He helped organize a teachers' strike at his school in [[Tehran]], and was in the vicinity of [[Black Friday (1978)|Jaleh Square]] when the Shah's troops opened fire on protesters, killing and injuring many. Later, he found his way to [[Iranian Kurdistan]], where [[1979 Kurdish rebellion in Iran|Kurdish partisans]] made a deep impression on him. Years later, in southern Lebanon, he occasionally wore the uniform of the Kurdish [[peshmerga]] which he was given in Iranian Kurdistan.

===Civil war in Lebanon===
In the fall of 1978, Monte made his way to [[Beirut]], the capital of [[Lebanon]], in time to participate in the defense of the Armenian quarter against the right-wing [[Kataeb Party|Phalange]] forces. Monte was affiliated with the Hunchakian socialist party and was a permanent member of the militia's bases in Bourj Hamoud, Western Beirut, Antelias, Eastern Beirut and other regions for almost two years, during which time he participated in several street battles against rightist forces. He also began working behind the lines in Phalangist controlled territory, on behalf of the "Leftist and Arab" Lebanese National Movement. By this time, he was speaking Armenian&amp;nbsp;– a language he had not learned until adulthood (Armenian was the fourth or fifth language Monte learned to speak fluently, after Spanish, French and Japanese. In addition, he spoke passable Arabic, Italian and Turkish, as well as some [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===ASALA===
In the spring of 1980, Monte was inducted into the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia, [[ASALA]], and secretly relocated to West Beirut. For the next three years he was an ASALA militant and contributor to the group's journal, ''[[Hayastan (periodical)|Hayastan]]''. During this time several Palestinian militant organizations provided their Armenian comrade with extensive military training. Monte carried out armed operations in [[Rome]], [[Athens]] and elsewhere, and he helped to plan and train commandos for the "[[Van Operation]]" of September 24, 1981, in which four ASALA militants took over the Turkish [[embassy]] in [[Paris]] and held it for several days. In November 1981, French police arrested and imprisoned a young, suspected criminal carrying a Cypriot passport bearing the name "Dimitri Georgiu." Following the detonation of several bombs in Paris aimed at gaining his release, "Georgiu" was returned to Lebanon where he revealed his identity as Monte Melkonian.

In mid-July 1983, ASALA violently split into two factions, one opposed to the group's despotic leader, whose [[nom de guerre]] was [[Hagop Hagopian (guerilla)|Hagop Hagopian]], and another supporting him. Although the lines of fissure had been deepening over the course of several years, the shooting of Hagopian's two closest aides at a military camp in Lebanon finally led to the open breach. This impetuous action was perpetrated by one individual who was not closely affiliated with Monte. As a result of this action, however, Hagopian took revenge by personally torturing and executing two of Monte's dearest comrades, Garlen Ananian and Arum Vartanian.

===Arrest and imprisonment===
In the aftermath of this split, Monte spent over two years underground, in Lebanon and later in [[France]]. After testifying secretly for the defense in the trial of Armenian militant and accused bank robber Levon Minassian, he was arrested in Paris in November 1985, and sentenced to six years in prison for possession of falsified papers and carrying an illegal handgun.

Monte spent over three years in Fresnes and Poissy prisons. He was released in early 1989 and sent from France to [[South Yemen]], where he was reunited with his girlfriend Seda. Together they spent year and a half living underground in various countries of eastern Europe in relative poverty, as one regime after another disintegrated.

==Armenia==
On October 6, 1990 Monte arrived in what was then still Soviet Armenia. During the first 8 months in Armenia, Melkonian worked in the Armenian Academy of Sciences, where he prepared an archaeological research monograph on [[Urartu|Urartian]] cave tombs, which was posthumously published in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;"Հայաստանի հնագիտական հուշարձաններ, հ. 16 [Archaeological Monuments of Armenia, vol. 16], Yerevan, Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the Academy of Sciences of Armenia, 1995"&lt;/ref&gt;

Finding himself on Armenian soil after many years, he wrote in a letter that he found a lot of confusion among his compatriots. Armenia faced enormous economic, political and environmental problems at every turn, problems that had festered for decades. New political forces bent on dismantling the Soviet Union were taking Armenia in a direction that Monte believed was bound to exacerbate the crisis and produce more problems. He believed that "a national blunder was taking place right before his eyes."&lt;ref name="markar avo 2011"/&gt;

Under these circumstances, it quickly became clear to Monte that, for better or for worse, the Soviet Union had no future and the coming years would be perilous ones for the Armenian people. He then focused his energy on [[Karabakh|Karabagh]]. "If we lose [Karabagh]," the bulletin of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army|Karabakh Defense Forces]] quoted him as saying, "we turn the final page of our people's history." He believed that, if Azeri forces succeeded in deporting Armenians from Karabakh, they would advance on [[Syunik Province|Zangezur]] and other regions of Armenia. Thus, he saw the fate of Karabagh as crucial for the long-term security of the entire Armenian nation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Nagorno-Karabakh===
[[File:Monte Melkonian Yerablur.jpg|thumb|Monte Melkonyan's tomb at [[Yerablur]] military cemetery]]
On September 12 (or 14) 1991 Monte travelled to [[Shahumian]] region (north of Karabagh), where he fought for three months in the fall of 1991.  There he participated in the capture of Erkej, Manashid and Buzlukh villages.

On February 4, 1992 Melkonian arrived in [[Martuni Province|Martuni]] as the regional commander.  Upon his arrival the changes were immediately felt: civilians started feeling more secure and at peace as Azeri armies were pushed back and were finding it increasingly difficult to shell Martuni's residential areas with [[BM-21|GRAD]] missiles.

In April 1993, Melkonian was one of the chief military strategists who planned and led the operation to fight Azeri fighters and capture the region of [[Kalbajar]] of [[Azerbaijan]] which lies between the Republic of Armenia and former [[NKAO]]. Armenian forces captured the region in four days of heavy fighting, sustaining far fewer fatalities than the enemy.&lt;ref name="Croissant, Michael P. 1998"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Monte Melkonian bust Victory Park, Yerevan2.jpg|thumb|Melkonian's bust at the [[Victory Park (Yerevan)|Victory Park]], Yerevan.]]

Monte was killed in the abandoned village of Merzili in the early afternoon of June 12, 1993{{sfn|de Waal|2003|p=208}} during the [[Battle of Aghdam]]. According to Markar Melkonian, Monte's older brother and author of his biography, Monte died in the waning hours of the evening by enemy fire during an unexpected skirmish that broke out with several Azerbaijani soldiers who had likely gotten lost.{{sfn|Melkonian|2005|p=264}}

Monte was buried with full military honors on June 19, 1993 at [[Yerablur]] military cemetery in the outskirts of Yerevan, where his coffin was brought from the [[Surp Zoravor Astvatsatsin Church|Surb Zoravar Church]] in the city center.&lt;ref name="AIM 1993"/&gt; Some 50,000 to 100,000 people (some reports put the figure as high as 250,000),{{sfn|Krikorian|2007|p=242}} including Armenian President [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]],&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt; acting Defense Minister [[Vazgen Manukyan]], Deputy Foreign Minister [[Gerard Libaridian]], government officials, and parliamentarians attended his funeral.&lt;ref name="AIM 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Commander Mourned|journal=Armenian International Magazine|date=June 1993|volume=4|issue=5|issn=1050-3471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public image===
Monte had become a legend in Armenia and Karabakh by the time of his death.&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt; Due to his international socialist and Armenian nationalist views, one author described him as a mix between the early 20th century Armenian military commander [[Andranik]] and Marxist revolutionary [[Che Guevara]].&lt;ref name="Afeyan"/&gt; [[Thomas de Waal]] described him as a "professional warrior and an extreme Armenian nationalist"{{sfn|de Waal|2013|p=220}} who is "the most celebrated Armenian commander" of the Nagorno-Karabakh War.{{sfn|de Waal|2013|p=341}} [[Raymond Bonner]] wrote in 1993 that Monte had charisma and discipline, which is why he "rapidly became the most highly regarded commander in the Karabakh War."&lt;ref name="Bonner"/&gt; Historian [[Razmik Panossian]] wrote that Monte was "a charismatic and very capable commander."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panossian|first1=Razmik|authorlink1=Razmik Panossian|title=Between ambivalence and intrusion: Politics and identity in Armenia-diaspora relations|journal=Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies|date=1998|volume=7|issue=2|pages=149–196|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/dsp/summary/v007/7.2.panossian.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armenia's Defense Minister [[Vazgen Sargsyan]] called Monte the most honest person in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Asatryan|first1=Gevorg|title=Մեր Մոնթեն [Our Monte]|url=http://www.hayzinvor.am/373.html|work=Hay Zinvor|publisher=Defense Ministry of the Republic of Armenia|date=December 2010|language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views and beliefs==
===Political views===
Melkonian was an [[Armenian nationalist]] and a [[revolutionary socialist]].&lt;ref name="nationalinterest"&gt;{{cite news|last1=de Waal|first1=Thomas|authorlink1=Thomas de Waal|title=More War in the Caucasus|url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/more-war-caucasus-4846|work=[[The National Interest]]|date=9 February 2011|quote=...Californian-born Armenian nationalist commander Monte Melkonian...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Afeyan"/&gt; Throughout his life he sympathized with [[Marxism–Leninism]], which was also the ideology of ASALA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hasratian|first1=Senor|title=The fighter for the idea|date=2007|publisher=Sona|location=Stepanakert|isbn=9789994158232|page=7|quote=...throughout his lifetime Monte Melkonian sincerely sympathized with the theory of Marxism-Leninism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gore|first1=Patrick Wilson|title='Tis Some Poor Fellow's Skull: Post-Soviet Warfare in the Southern Caucasus|date=2008|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0595486793|page=19|quote=ASALA was Marxist-Leninist and one of its leaders, the Armenian-American Monte Melkonian...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vorbach wrote in 1994 that his writings "expose him as an Armenian nationalist and a committed socialist of the Marxist-Leninist variety."{{sfn|Vorbach|1994|p=178}} According to his brother he "had not always been a [[communist]], but he had never been an ''ex''-communist." Melkonian hoped that the Soviet Union would "reform itself, democratize, and promote personal freedoms" and did not abandon hope in Soviet Armenia until the end of the Soviet era appeared inevitable.&lt;ref name="markar avo 2011"/&gt; [[Philip Marsden]] wrote that his career "reveals the profound shift in radical ideology—from revolutionary Marxism to nationalism." Marsden adds that in the 1980s his ideology came into conflict with a growing nationalism: "With ever greater difficulty, he squeezed the Armenian question into the context of left-wing orthodoxy, believing for instance that Armenia's independence from the Soviet Union would be a terrible error."&lt;ref name="Marsden"/&gt; In the 1980s he advocated for the Soviet takeover of [[Western Armenia|Turkey's formerly Armenian populated areas]] and its unification with Soviet Armenia.&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt; In the 1980s, while in a French prison, he called for the creation of a guerilla force in eastern Turkey which would unite Kurdish rebels, left-wing Turks, and Armenian revolutionaries.&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt; Vorbach summarized his views on Turkey:{{sfn|Vorbach|1994|pp=178-179}}

{{quote|He was a revolutionary personality motivated by the vision of an overthrow of the 'chauvinist' leadership in Turkey and the establishment of a revolutionary socialist government (be it Turkish, Kurdish, Armenian or Soviet Armenian) under which Armenians could live freely in their historic homeland, which includes areas in present day Turkey.}}

By the early 1990s he saw Karabakh as a "sacred cause".{{sfn|de Waal|2013|p=220}} He is quoted as saying, "If we lose Karabakh, we turn the final page of our people's history."{{sfn|Krikorian|2007|p=241}}

Monte was also an [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]].&lt;ref name="Afeyan"/&gt; In an article titled "Imperialism in the New World Order" he declared his support for socialist movements in [[Palestinian fedayeen|Palestine]], [[Internal resistance to apartheid|South Africa]], Central America and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="markar avo 2011"/&gt; He also espoused [[environmentalism]] from an [[anti-capitalist]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simonyan|first1=Anahit|title=Հայաստանն օտար ներդրողների համար դարձել է համեղ պատառ|url=http://www.asparez.am/news-hy/hayastann_otar_nerkroxneri_hamr-hy/|work=Asparez|date=15 November 2013|language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one author his economic views were influenced by the Beirut-based Armenian Marxist economist [[Alexander Yenikomshian]].&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt;

Maile Melkonian, Monte's sister wrote in response to [[David Rieff]]'s 1997 article in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' that Melkonian was never associated with and was not a supporter of the views of the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (Dashnaks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melkonian|first1=Maile|title=The Facts of the Case|journal=[[Foreign Affairs]]|date=November–December 1997|volume=76|issue=6|page=184|jstor=20048351|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
According to Vorbach Melkonian had become an atheist at the time of his revolutionary activities.{{sfn|Vorbach|1994|p=181}}

===Alcohol consumption===
[[Raymond Bonner]] wrote that Monte was said to have led an exemplary life by not smoking and drinking.&lt;ref name="Bonner"/&gt; Monte is widely known to have forbidden his soldiers consumption of alcohol.{{sfn|de Waal|2013|p=220}} He also established a policy of collecting a tax in kind on Martuni wine, in the form of diesel and ammunition for his fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melkonian|first1=Monte|editor1-last=Melkonian|editor1-first=Markar|title=The Right to Struggle: Selected Writings by Monte Melkonian on the Armenian National Question|date=1993|publisher=Sardarabad Collective|page=xvi|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Monte Melkonian married his long-time girlfriend Seda Kebranian at the [[Geghard]] monastery in Armenia in August 1991. They had met in the late 1970s in Lebanon. In a 1993 interview Monte said that they had had no time to start a family. He stated, "We'll settle down when the Armenian people's struggle is over."&lt;ref name="Loiko McWilliam"/&gt;

As of 2013 Seda, an activist and a lecturer, resided in [[Anchorage, Alaska]] with her husband Joel Condon who is a professor of architecture at the [[University of Alaska Anchorage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liberty by Joel Condon|url=http://www.bobbysandstrust.com/archives/2476|publisher=Bobby Sands Trust|date=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remembering Monte Melkonian|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YHQfni3h78|publisher=[[CivilNet]]|date=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Nicolaos Matussis was born in the village of [[Samarina]] in 1899, into an Aromanian (Vlach) family. After graduating from the Gymnasium in [[Trikala]], he studied law at the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]]. He then went on to work as a lawyer in [[Larissa]]. He was a devoted Aromanian nationalist and became an early member of the [[Communist Party of Greece]], even becoming a member of its central committee before being expelled from it in 1926. He then returned to Larissa where he was active in [[Ioannis Sofianopoulos]]'s [[Agrarian Party (Greece)|Agrarian Party]].&lt;ref name="Kouk"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |first=Demosthenes |last=Koukounas |title=Η Ιστορία της Κατοχής |trans-title=History of the Occupation |volume=II |language=Greek |publisher=Livani |location=Athens |year=2013 |isbn=978-960-14-2687-7|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
With the beginning of the [[Axis occupation of Greece]], Matussis reestablished his links with [[Alcibiades Diamandi]] whom he had first met in 1920. Together they founded the Aromanian separatist state of the [[Principality of the Pindus]], spanning from [[Thessaly]] to Epirus and Macedonia, and encompassing all Vlach populated areas within Greece. Matussis, Demosthenes Tsoutras and Konstantinos Tahas confounded the Italian-sponsored [[Vlach "Roman Legion"]] which became the state's official military force.&lt;ref name="Kouk"/&gt; In 1942, after Diamandi suddenly left Greece to go to Romania, Matussi became leader of the so-called Roman Legion.&lt;ref name="papagiannis"&gt;Τα παιδιά της λύκαινας.

Having abandoned his ambitions of a Vlach state, he founded a pro-German collaborationist organization Organization of Pioneers of New Europe (OPNE). In late 1943 or early 1944, he followed Diamandi's footsteps, fleeing to [[Romania]].&lt;ref name="Kouk"/&gt;

Following [[King Michael's Coup]], the [[Romanian Communist Party]] seized power in the country, sentencing Matussis to 20 years in prison on a [[Danube]] island. In 1964, following his requests and also the request of the Greek government, he was released to the hands of Greek authorities, who put him to prison and took him to court, accused of treason (like several  members of the "Roman Legion" in the courts just after the war in 1945–1947). In this court (which took place in Athens, far from Larissa where he was active) and with the support of defense witnesses he was declared innocent of war crimes. In 1976 his civil rights were completely restored by a Greek court.&lt;ref name="Tsoutsas"&gt;[http://www.almyros.vlahoi.net/propaganda.htm Η ρουμάνικη προπαγάνδα] (The Romanian Propaganda), www.almyros.vlahoi.net, Digital version of the book: ΒΛΑΧΟΙ, ΙΣΤΟΡΙΑ - ΠΟΛΙΤΙΣΜΟΣ - ΕΘΙΜΑ ΠΡΟΣΩΠΙΚΟΤΗΤΕΣ, ΣΥΛΛΟΓΟΣ ΒΛΑΧΩΝ ΕΠΑΡΧΙΑΣ ΑΛΜΥΡΟΥ, επιμέλεια: Δημήτριος Γ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6749">The composer [[Joseph Haydn]] is sometimes given the nickname '''"Papa" Haydn'''. The practice began in Haydn's lifetime and has continued to the present day. 

Höslinger (2009) identifies three senses of the term, discussed below in the order of their chronological origin.

=="Papa" as a term of affection==

"Papa Haydn" started out as a term of affection bestowed on Haydn by the musicians who worked for him. After 1766 Haydn was the [[Kapellmeister]] at the [[Esterházy]] court, presiding over a fairly large group of musicians. His authority was evidently rather benevolent, as he often interceded with [[Nikolaus Esterházy|Prince Esterházy]] on behalf of musicians who had gotten in trouble.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion and examples, see {{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|pp=46–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tale of the [[Symphony No. 45 (Haydn)|"Farewell" Symphony]] attests to Haydn's willingness to act on behalf of his subordinates. The practice of calling Haydn "Papa" became increasingly plausible as Haydn's 30-plus years of service in the Eszterházy court went by; with each year, he would have become increasingly older than the average musician serving under him.

As time went by, the group of musicians who called Haydn "Papa" expanded beyond the Esterházy court{{sfn|Höslinger|2009}} and included Haydn's friend [[Haydn and Mozart|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].&lt;ref&gt;In his old age, Haydn remarked to [[Georg August Griesinger]] that Mozart had called him "Papa". The remark was recorded in a letter Griesinger sent to the publishers [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]], for whom he served as representative. Source: Deutsch (1965, 489)&lt;/ref&gt;

Höslinger summarizes this aspect of "Papa Haydn" thus:  "'Papa' arose as a term of affection, commonly used by the Esterházy players ... for a father figure, somebody who willingly gave advice and who was generally respected as a musician." He notes that in Haydn's time the term was used for other musicians as well; e.g. "[[Franz Schubert]] called [[Antonio Salieri|Salieri]] his 'Grosspapa' (German: 'grandad')".{{sfn|Höslinger|2009|p=206}}

=="Papa" as founder==
Another sense of the term "Papa Haydn" came from his role in the history of [[classical music]], notably in the development of the [[symphony]] and [[string quartet]]. While Haydn did not invent either genre, his work is considered important enough that the labels "Father of the Symphony" and "Father of the String Quartet" are often attached to him.&lt;ref&gt;A. Peter Brown writes, "It is almost a cliché to say that Haydn was the father of the symphony. But it could also be said that he was the father of the string quartet, the piano trio, and the keyboard sonata as we conceive these genres today. But to say that he was the "father" of these genres should not be confused with his being the inventor; instead, he was the prime propagator. Indeed, Haydn's accomplishment was the establishment of these genres in the modern sense." (Brown 2002, 301)&lt;/ref&gt; Even in his own lifetime, this perspective was prevalent. In 1797, the [[Tonkünstler-Societät]] of Vienna passed the resolution to make him a life member, "by virtue of his extraordinary merit as the father and reformer of the noble art of music."&lt;ref&gt;From the online edition of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''&lt;/ref&gt; When in 1798 [[Franz Niemetschek]] published a biography of Mozart, he dedicated the book to Haydn, calling him "father of the noble art of music and favorite of the Muses."

Höslinger asserts that this usage of "Papa Haydn" increased during the 19th century, "as the sense of reverence for older composers increased."{{sfn|Höslinger|2009|p=206}}

=="Papa" as pejorative==

This usage, which arose in the 19th century, is characterized thus by Höslinger: it is "a more patronizing, even dismissive one. In comparison with Romantic artists and [[Romantic music]], Haydn and his output were seen as genial, but naive and superficial."

With the rise of acclaim for Haydn's music during the 20th century, the patronizing sense of "Papa Haydn" caused scholars and critics to become leery of the term, seeing it as a distortion of the composer's work. For example, Haydn scholar [[Jens Peter Larsen]] wrote (1980):

{{quote|For years the nickname 'Papa Haydn' has characterized the composer. Used by his own musicians and others as a tribute of affection and respect, the expression increasingly took on misleading connotations, and came to signify a benevolent but bewigged and old-fashioned classic. The recent revival of interest in Haydn's music has made plain that the traditional picture had become a caricature, and that it gave a false impression of richness and diversity of his development as a composer.{{sfn|Larsen|1980}}}}

Because music education materials still tend to reflect 19th-century sources, the patronizing sense of "Papa Haydn" is well known to musicians, reflected in conventionalized, bewigged portraits of the composer (see right), or in the lyrics of the rhyme below, commonly taught to children (it is sung to the first bars of the second movement of the ''[[Surprise Symphony]]''):
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;
Papa Haydn's dead and gone
  but his memory lingers on.
When his mood was one of bliss
  he wrote jolly tunes like this.&lt;/poem&gt;

Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Brown received each of his degrees from the [[University of Chicago]], including his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in 1976 and [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1982. His [[Ph.D.]], granted in 1980 while under the guidance of [[Nicholas R. Cozzarelli]], involved the study of DNA [[topoisomerase]]s.&lt;ref name=bmcb2013&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = P.

==Academic career==
After getting his medical degree in 1982, Brown completed a 3-year pediatric residency at [[Lurie Children's Hospital|Children’s Memorial Hospital]] in Chicago but decided he could have a greater impact through basic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DNA Learning Center|url= https://www.dnalc.org/view/16013-Patrick-Henry-Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Brown took a 3-year postdoctoral fellowship at [[University of California]], San Francisco with [[J. Michael Bishop]] and [[Harold Varmus]] (who shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in Medicine for their discoveries about how genes can ignite cancerous tumors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Official Web Site of the Nobel Prize|url=  https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1989/}}&lt;/ref&gt; At UCSF, Brown and colleagues defined the mechanism by which [[retrovirus]]es, such as the [[HIV|AIDS virus]], integrate their [[genes]] into the [[genome]] of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s they infect, which helped lead to development of new drugs to fight the disease.&lt;ref name="Medicine of the Midway"&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicine of the Midway|url=http://www.uchospitals.edu/pdf/uch_008490.pdf/|date=Spring 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Brown became an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biochemistry at Stanford University School of Medicine, where he continued to investigate retroviral replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DNA Learning Center|url=https://www.dnalc.org/view/16013-Patrick-Henry-Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, Brown began developing a new technology to enable systematic investigation of the behavior and properties of whole genomes—called [[DNA microarrays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanford Medicine Magazine|url=http://sm.stanford.edu/archive/stanmed/2005fall/microarray.html|date=Fall 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I had a mental image of a DNA microarray, even including the red and green fluorescent spots, a few years before I'd figured out the details of making them," Brown told The Scientist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The DNA Microarray|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/16657/title/The-DNA-Microarray/|date=August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown and his colleagues created a robotic dispenser that could deposit minute quantities of tens of thousands of individual genes onto a single [[Microscope slide|glass slide]], a “DNA microarray” or "gene chip." By flooding the slide with [[Fluorescence|fluorescently]] labeled genetic material derived from a living sample, a researcher could see which genes were being expressed in cells.&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Steal This Research Paper! (You Already Paid for It.)|url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/michael-eisen-plos-open-access-aaron-swartz/|journal=Mother Jones|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after their first description of DNA microarrays, the Brown laboratory published a “how-to” manual on the [[World Wide Web|Web]] that helped these robotic devices become standard equipment in life science labs throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Medicine of the Midway"/&gt;

Brown and his colleagues developed experimental methods for using DNA microarrays to investigate basic principles of genome organization, gene expression, cell regulation and specialization, physiology, development and disease, and the [[microbiome]], along with statistical and computational tools for visualizing and interpreting the resulting large volumes of data.  Microarray technologies are widely used for comparing gene expression patterns and other genome features among individuals and their tissues and cells, providing information on disease subcategories, disease prognosis, and treatment outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=DNA microarrays: a powerful genomic tool for biomedical and clinical research|journal=Molecular Medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)|volume=13|issue=9–10|pages=527–541|pmc=1933257|date=2007-06-11|last1=Trevino|first1=V.|last2=Falciani|first2=F.|last3=Barrera-Saldaña|first3=H. A.|pmid=17660860|doi=10.2119/2006-00107.Trevino}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the late 1990s, Brown began publicly voicing concern over what he called "a fundamentally flawed process of [[Academic publishing|scientific publishing]],"&lt;ref name="Medicine of the Midway"/&gt; in which academics typically published results of publicly funded research in private, commercial publishing houses that charged subscription fees for access to journals. “We viewed this entire process as being patently unfair. Not only were scientists in poor countries being denied access to the latest and best information out there, but the public who supports this research was being denied access as well. We felt there simply had to be a better way to do it," Brown told a University of Chicago medical journal.&lt;ref name="Medicine of the Midway"/&gt;

Brown began a collaboration with other scientists, including Harold Varmus (then director of the [[National Institutes of Health]]), [[David J. Lipman]] (then director of the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]), and [[Michael Eisen]] of [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], to overhaul the scientific and medical publishing systems to make papers available on the rapidly developing Internet platforms such as [[Usenet]] and the World Wide Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=New Communication Paradigm for Science in the 21st Century|url=http://www.jyi.org/issue/new-communication-paradigm-for-science-in-the-21st-century/|journal=Journal of Young Investigators|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Why should publishers be able to control what I can do with information that was published by my scientific colleagues whose motivation was exactly to have their discoveries contribute to future discoveries? ... We had already existing tools that we could use to so to speak [[hyperlink]] things so that you could reorganize information in systematic ways, but they weren't really being exploited by the conventional scientific literature," Brown said in an interview with BioMedCentral Biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=An interview with Patrick O Brown on the origins and future of open access|pmc=3626920|journal=BioMedCentral Biology|volume=11|pages=33|date=2013-04-15|last1=Brown|first1=P. O.|pmid=23587113|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-11-33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nature (journal)|magazine Nature]] reported that the scientists' [[open-access]] movement could "spell the end for many print titles";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The writing is on the web for science journals in print|journal=Nature|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v397/n6716/full/397195a0.html|date=1999-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown called subscription-based scientific journals "anachronisms."&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"/&gt;

In 2001, Brown, Eisen and Varmus co-founded the [[PLOS|Public Library of Science]] (PLOS) to make published scientific research open access and freely available to researchers in the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brower|first=Vicki|date=2001-11-15|title=Public library of science shifts gears|journal=EMBO Reports|volume=2|issue=11|pages=972–973|doi=10.1093/embo-reports/kve239|issn=1469-221X|pmc=1084138|pmid=11713184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funded by a grant from the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]], the [[non-profit organization]] advocated for designing alternative systems to fund for scientific publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisen|first=Michael B.|last2=Brown|first2=Patrick O.|last3=Varmus|first3=Harold E.|date=2002-09-12|title=Public-access group supports PubMed Central|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v419/n6903/full/419111c.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=419|issue=6903|pages=111|doi=10.1038/419111c|issn=0028-0836|pmid=12226637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Brown was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], identifying him as one of the top 2000 scientists in the nation. He is a member of the [[National Academy of Medicine]] and a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;ref name="HHMI Bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=HHMI Bio|url=http://www.hhmi.org/research/investigators/brown_bio.html|publisher=HHMI|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impossible Foods==
In 2009, Brown took an 18-month [[sabbatical]] where he considered how to spend the rest of his career.&lt;ref name="psmag.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Biography of a Plant-Based Burger: One man's mission to make meat obsolete|url=https://psmag.com/the-biography-of-a-plant-based-burger-31acbecb0dcc#.1dzfvzx4b|date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown decided that the world's largest [[Environmental issue|environmental problem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Triple Whopper Environmental Impact of Global Meat Production|journal=Time|url=http://science.time.com/2013/12/16/the-triple-whopper-environmental-impact-of-global-meat-production/|date=2013-12-16}},&lt;/ref&gt; and the problem where he could have the most impact, was the use of [[Livestock|animals]] to produce food. He organized a conference to raise awareness of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/banr/AnimalProductionMaterials/ScopingWorkshopBackground.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; But the National Research Council workshop, called "The Role of Animal Agriculture in a Sustainable 21st Century Global Food System,” had minimal impact; soon after, he decided the best way to reduce animal agriculture was to offer a competing product in the free market.&lt;ref name="psmag.com"/&gt;

By the end of his sabbatical, Brown had articulated the first steps of his business plan and began to recruit a small team of scientists to determine precisely why [[meat]] smells, handles, cooks and tastes like meat.&lt;ref name="psmag.com"/&gt; Brown said he had a "hunch" that the key to meat's unique taste was its high abundance of [[heme]], an iron-containing molecule in blood that carries oxygen and is found in all living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Silicon Valley's Bloody Plant Burger Smells, Tastes And Sizzles Like Meat|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/06/21/482322571/silicon-valley-s-bloody-plant-burger-smells-tastes-and-sizzles-like-meat|journal=NPR|date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown theorized that, if he could generate large amounts of heme from plant sources, he could recreate the taste of animal meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=We tried the plant-based 'impossible burger' that's backed by Bill Gates|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/29/impossible-burger-our-test-tube-meat-tastes-great.html|journal=CNBC|date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown and a small group of early employees tested the hunch by digging up [[clover]] roots, which for the plant kingdom contain high amounts of heme. "I dissected them off with a razor blade then blended them up just to see what I could extract. I was just poking around, feasibility-testing some ideas. I got to a point where, though I didn’t have much data, I’d enough to go and talk to some [[venture-capital]] companies — of which there are a ridiculous number in [[Silicon Valley]] — and hit them for some money,” Brown told The Sunday Times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Can the meat-free Impossible Burger save the world|url=https://www.driving.co.uk/news/lifestyle/impossible-burger/|journal=Sunday Times|date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown raised a Series A round of $9 million from [[Khosla Ventures]] and founded [[Impossible Foods]] in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=xx|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/impossible-foods#/entity|journal=CrunchBase}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown and his team spent five years researching and developing the Impossible [[hamburger|Burger]], which launched in restaurants in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=David Chang Adds Plant Based 'Impossible Burger' to Nishi Menu|url=https://ny.eater.com/2016/7/26/12277310/david-chang-impossible-burger-nishi|journal=Eater|date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impossible Foods is also working on [[plant]]-based [[pork]], [[chicken]], [[fish]] and [[dairy]] products made without any animals.&lt;ref name="Impossible Foods profile"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Secret of These New Veggie Burgers: Plant Blood|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/article_email/the-secret-of-these-new-veggie-burgers-plant-blood-1412725267-lMyQjAxMTE0MjAzNzUwNjc3Wj|publisher=WSJ|accessdate=21 Apr 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2000, Brown received the National Academy of Sciences Award in Molecular Biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasonline.org/programs/awards/molecular-biology.html?referrer=http://nationalacademyofsciences.org/member-directory/members/3006491.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/ | title=NAS Award in Molecular Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Le Flem''' (18 March 1881 – 31 July 1984) was a [[France|French]] [[composer]] and [[music critic]].

==Biography ==
Born in [[Radon, Orne]], and living most of his life in [[Lézardrieux]], Le Flem studied at the Schola Cantorum under [[Vincent d'Indy]] and [[Albert Roussel]], later teaching at the same establishment, where his pupils included [[Erik Satie]] and [[André Jolivet]]. His music is strongly influenced by his native [[Brittany]], the landscape of which is reflected in most of his work.

Before [[World War I]], Le Flem produced several major works, including his First Symphony, a Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra, and an opera. The war temporarily put an end to his compositional activities, and in its aftermath he devoted himself to music criticism and choral [[conducting]]. He wrote numerous articles for the periodical ''Comoedia''.

In 1937, he began composing once again. Three additional symphonies and a second opera followed before he was finally forced to give up composition in 1976, at the age of 95, due to blindness. He died on 31 July 1984 at the age of 103.

Some of his dramatic works include the operas ''Le Rossignol de St-Malo'' (The Nightingale of St Malo) and ''La Magicienne de la mer'' (The Magician of the Sea), as well as a version of the [[chante-fable]] ''[[Aucassin et Nicolette]]''. ''For the Dead'' and the seven ''Pièces enfantines'', both originally written in 1911, were orchestrated some years later. Two of the composer's children died young, and ''For the Dead'' is dedicated to their memory. In addition to his symphonies, Le Flem wrote evocative orchestral music such as ''En mer'' (At Sea) and ''La Voix du large'' (The Voice of the Open Sea). Le Flem also composed the music for [[Jean Tedesco]]'s short film ''The Great Gardener of France'' in 1942.

Le Flem was a member of the [[Association des Compositeurs Breton]]; another member, the Irish-American [[Swan Hennessy]] (1866–1929) dedicated his ''Petit trio celtique'', Op. 52 (1921) to Le Flem.

==Personal life ==
Paul Le Flem, with his wife, Jeanne (Even), was the grandfather of actress [[Marika Green]] and great-grandfather of actress [[Eva Green]] by his daughter, Jeanne, who married [[Swedes|Swedish]] journalist Lennart Green.&lt;ref&gt;Le Flem's family genealogy [http://lebarbu1.skyrock.com/704583925-Genealogie-la-branche-des-Le-Flem-1.html] Article published in Ouest-France, 24 January 2007: "Fifteen days after her husband, Lennart Green, Jeanne Green-Le Flem [...] died Friday aged 95 [...]. The ceremony took place in the privacy of the family [...] her daughter, actress Marika Green, her granddaughters Joy and Eva Green [...] and her daughter in law Marlène Jobert. Madame Green-Le Flem, daughter of [French] composer Paul Le Flem, was buried in the family vault in the cemetery of Vieux-Marché [near the city of Lannion, Brittanny, France].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lebarbu1.skyrock.com/714543303-La-famille-de-Paul-Le-Flem.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://michel.lemeu.pagesperso-orange.fr/le_flem/plf_art.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paulaseer Lawrie Muthukrishna''' (24 February 1921{{spaced ndash}} 24 February 1989); was an Indian [[preacher]] who had followers worldwide. He is known for his [[faith healing|faith-healing]] movement and initiated the "[[One God, One Nation]] movement" in India.

==Early life, education and early career==
R. Paulaseer Lawrie was born to father, Deva Rasiah, and mother, Nesammal, at the Lakshmi Tea Estate in [[Munnar]], [[Kerala]].
  
Soon after his birth, the family moved to Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]). Paulaseer stayed back to study at [[St. John's College (Palayamkottai)|St. John's College]], located in [[Palayamkottai]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. After finishing the intermediate class of university studies, he went to Ceylon and studied commercial subjects for one year. He then went to [[Wesley College, Colombo]], located in [[Colombo]] to gain the [[London Matric certificate]].

After this, he went back to [[Madras]], Tamil Nadu, and joined the [[Christian College (Tambaran)|Christian College]], located in [[Tambaram]], Tamil Nadu, for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree. As [[World War II]] began, a vigorous recruiting for officers was afoot. Paulaseer wanted to join the [[Indian Army]] and took some training. On knowing this, his father came over and forced Paulaseer to return with him to Ceylon. Paulaseer came back to India to continue his studies. He got a seat in [[St. Xavier's College (Palayamkottai)|St. Xavier's College]], located in [[Palayamkottai]], Tamil Nadu.

In August 1942, when the national leaders launched the [[Quit India Movement]], he organized a big student strike in his college. The police attempted to apprehend him, but he managed to escape to Ceylon where, soon after arrival, he got a job in one of the tea estates as a [[stenographer]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergunder, Michael (2003). "From Pentecostal Healing Evangelist to Kalki Avatar", in ''Christians and Missionaries in India: Cross-Cultural Communication since 1500'', edited by Robert Eric Frykenberg and Alaine M. Low.  [[Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing]].  p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time Paulaseer began to read political and religious works and to have visions. In 1946, he went to India on a short holiday. While going with his mother to a friend's house, he saw everything according to the dreams he had had about his wife-to-be. The church, the road, the house and its inmates and every detail flashed back in great vividness. Thus assured that the girl in that house was the one chosen by the Lord, he consented to marry, and they were engaged. His mother was there, but his father was in Ceylon. So the marriage had to be postponed for six months; it occurred 26 May 1947.

When his first child was seriously ill, Paulaseer prayed in an [[Anglicanism|Anglican church]] and promised to devote his life to God if the child recovered. After his son's recovery, he resigned his job in Ceylon and returned to India. He took a job on the [[Yercaud]] Estate, located in Tamil Nadu, and later at the Christian Medical College Hospital, (CMCH)located in [[Vellore]], Tamil Nadu.

==Evangelical career==
[[File:Bran&amp;Lawrie.jpg|thumb|Paulaseer (right) with American [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[William M. Branham]] (unknown date).]]
In response to more visions, Paulaseer resigned his job in 1953 in order to preach. He participated in a [[Mumbai|Bombay]] [[healing crusade]] of American evangelist [[William M. Branham]] in 1954, an acquaintance that was to be important later. A series of "miracles" sparked interest in Paulaseer's message. After preaching in various towns in South India, he crossed over to Ceylon on two missionary journeys. The first tour lasted from 25 October 1955 to 20 December 1955. The second longer tour was from 8 April 1956 until 17 June 1956.

After several years of evangelizing in India, Paulaseer was invited to an international conference in [[Scotland]].  From Scotland he went to the United States, where he attempted to acquire backing from an established [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] ministry. This was largely unsuccessful until he met with Branham, who encouraged him in his ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Bergunder, Michael (2003).  "From Pentecostal Healing Evangelist to Kalki Avatar: The Remarkable Life of Paulaseer Lawrie...," in ''Christians and Missionaries in India: Cross-Cultural Communication since 1500'', edited by Robert Eric Frykenberg and Alaine M. Low. [[Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing]].  pp. 357-375.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960s, his group gave refuge to the expelled CPM/TPM leader Alwin R. De Alvis. Together they conducted meetings in Vepery, Chennai. Later on when Alwin R. De Alvis started exercising authority over the entire group, Paulaseer left the group and started a new gathering of his followers in a larger hall called Jubilee Hall.

In 1967, Paulaseer took a long journey in the West, preaching to many of Branham's followers. In 1969 he took another tour, and this time some [[Branhamism|Branhamites]] experienced extraordinary things from his preaching. On 21 July 1969{{spaced ndash}} the day of the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing{{spaced ndash}} Paulaseer claimed to have become the second coming of Christ. His followers pointed to Branham's sermons to show that he recognized Paulaseer as such.  Paulaseer adopted from Branham a prediction that the Rapture would occur in 1977, and that only 700 would be saved. Many American followers abandoned Paulaseer after his predictions for that year failed to come true.&lt;ref&gt;''The Healer-Prophet, William Marrion Branham{{spaced ndash}} A Study of the Prophetic in American Pentecostalism''.  [[Mercer University Press]], 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;161–2. {{ISBN|978-0-86554-278-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Paulaseer changed his message somewhat, teaching ''Aadhi Bali'' or "Supreme Sacrifice"{{spaced ndash}} an idea from the [[Purusasukta]]. He began to draw much more on [[Hindu]] and even [[Muslim]] ideas, and attracted more native Indian followers.&lt;ref&gt;Bergunder, Michael (2003).  "From Pentecostal Healing Evangelist to Kalki Avatar: The Remarkable Life of Paulaseer Lawrie...," in ''Christians and Missionaries in India: Cross-Cultural Communication since 1500'', edited by Robert Eric Frykenberg and Alaine M. Low. [[Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing]]. pp. 357-375.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raul Sagarbarria Roco''' (October 26, 1941 – August 5, 2005) was a political figure in the [[Philippines]]. He was the standard-bearer of ''Aksyon Demokratiko'', which he founded in 1997 as a vehicle for his presidential bids in 1998 and [[Philippine general election, 2004|2004]]. He was a former [[Senate of the Philippines|senator]] and the Secretary of the Department of Education under the presidency of [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. He had a strong following among young voters in the Philippines, due to his efforts to promote honesty and [[good governance]].

Roco was married to [[Sonia Roco|Sonia Cubillo Malasarte]], who is from [[Bohol]]. They have six children (Robbie Pierre, Raul Jr., Sophia, Sareena, Rex and Synara) and seven grandchildren (Nica, Reece, Samantha, Shania, Santina, Beannie and RB).

==Early life &amp; education==

Raúl Roco was born in [[Naga City, Camarines Sur|Naga City]] in the [[Philippine province]] of [[Camarines Sur]], the son of farmer Sulpicio Azuela Roco and public school teacher Rosario Orlanda Sagarbarria.

Roco finished elementary school at age 10 from Naga Parochial School, and high school at age 14 from [[Ateneo de Naga]]. He graduated ''[[Latin honors|magna cum laude]]'' from [[San Beda College]] in [[Manila, Philippines|Manila]] with a degree in [[English studies|English]] at the age of 18. Then, he was also the Editor-in-Chief of [[The Bedan]] working with the likes of Rene Saguisag and Jaime Licauco. Later, Roco received a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree (also at San Beda College) and was the college's Abbott Awardee for Over-All Excellence.  In the [[United States]], he obtained his [[Master of Laws]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], while also enrolled at the [[Wharton School]].

He was the president of the National Union of Students of the Philippines in 1961 and was named one of the Ten Outstanding Students of the Philippines in 1964. His wife Sonia was the Most Outstanding Student that same year.

As a result of his various other achievements, he had been awarded seven [[honorary doctorate]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

==Political/professional career==

After he passed the bar in 1965, Roco lobbied for the holding of a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] that aimed to amend the 1935 Philippine Constitution. He campaigned for a seat to represent his district in [[Camarines Sur]]. He won and thus became convention's youngest [[Bicolano people|Bicolano]] delegate.

From 1983 to 1985, he served as president of the [[Integrated Bar of the Philippines]].  While there, he was on the legal staff of the late Philippine Senator [[Benigno Aquino Jr.|Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino]], and he drafted the Study Now, Pay Later law.

Alongside his work in law, he has also served as a film producer.  In 1974, he was the executive producer of the late film director Lino Brocka's movie ''Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang''; this film won six [[FAMAS award]]s that year, including best film.

Among all legislators of the Eighth Congress of the Philippines (which lasted from 1987–1992), he was adjudged by the Ford Foundation and the University of the Philippines Institute of Strategic and Development Studies as first in over-all performance.

===Senate===
Roco was elected to the Senate in 1992 and 1995 serving until 2001, making many contributions that led many to recognize him as an "outstanding senator".  He wrote the law which reformed the nation's banking system; this earned him the title "Father of the Bangko Sentral". Some other laws that he wrote resulted in the liberalization of the banking industry and the strengthening of the thrift banks. In addition, he wrote the Intellectual Property Code and the Securities Regulation Code.

Roco has also made several contributions to education in the Philippines.  He helped fund the teachers’ cooperatives as well as the increment mandated by the Magna Carta for Public School Teachers for retiring public school teachers.  On the students’ side, he helped bring computers into Philippine universities, colleges, and public schools. In addition, he devised a plan for meal scholarships for poor students at the Philippine Normal University.

Roco wrote several bills targeted at protecting and prioritizing women in the Philippines.  He wrote the Women in Nation Building Law, the Nursing Act, the Anti-Sexual Harassment Law, the Anti-Rape Law, and the Child and Family Courts Act.  He also let women play major roles in the Department of Education’s literacy program.  Out of thanks to his services for women, many women's groups named him an "Honorary Woman".

He also drafted a bill that abolished double taxation on Filipinos working abroad.

He was given the [[Bantay Katarungan]] award by [[Kilosbayan]] for playing an integral role in the Senate impeachment trial of then-president [[Joseph Estrada]] who was impeached by the House of Representatives on 2000 for graft and corruption. bribery, betrayal of public trust and culpable violation of the Philippine Constitution. Unfortunately, the impeachment trial was not concluded and on 2001, Estrada was ousted from power by another People Power uprising.

===As Secretary of Education===
Roco took over as education secretary of the Philippines in 2001, at a time when the Philippines had not only one of the ten most corrupt governments in the world (according to [[Transparency International]]), but its Department of Education was also the fourth-most corrupt of its agencies (as named by the Asia Foundation - Social Weather Stations Survey of Enterprises on Public Sector Corruption).  To combat this corruption, Roco imposed a department-wide transparency policy which also held employees accountable for the purchase of textbooks, which had been a major source of the department's corruption.  This allowed the department to purchase textbooks for a much lower price, and after just eight months under Roco's leadership, the Department of Education gained a 73% public approval rating and became the most trusted government agency in the Philippines.

During his tenure in that position, Roco allowed free public education (through high school) as required by the Philippine Constitution.  He also enacted a reform of basic education curriculum in order that children would focus their studies on reading, writing, arithmetic, science, and Makabayan. In addition, he made sure that teachers were paid promptly and ended the 3% "service fee" that the department had long been deducting from teachers' pay.

==Candidacy for President==

===1998===

Roco ran for president in the [[Philippine presidential election, 1998|1998 Philippine election]]. He lost to Vice-President [[Joseph Estrada]] but had a remarkable showing in a field of eleven candidates despite being an independent candidate. His strong showing was attributed to the widespread support he received from young Filipinos who eventually formed his party, Aksyon Demokratiko, and its youth arm, Aksyon Kabataan. Party leaders then included Jaime Galvez Tan, Lorna Patajo-Kapunan and Darwin Mariano.

===2004===

Roco rode his success in the Department of Education into a run for the Philippine presidency. His candidacy was based on his ability to fight corruption and to display fair play, decency, and honor.  His Aksyon Demokratiko party formed a coalition with Promdi and Reporma, the parties of 1998 presidential candidates [[Lito Osmeña]] and [[Renato de Villa]], to form the ''Alyansa ng Pag-asa'' (Alliance of Hope).

Roco was a front-runner in pre-election surveys and was considered a strong contender. However, during the campaign, he battled with [recurrence of his cancer],  after remission from his bout with [[prostate cancer]] in 1996. His illness forced him to leave the campaign trail for medical attention in the [[United States]]. Doctors told him that his condition was not life-threatening and that he could continue his run for the presidency. He returned to the campaign trail, but concerns about his illness greatly diminished his support.

He [[Philippine presidential election, 2004|lost the election]] to the [[incumbent]], [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], and finished fourth in a field of 5 candidates.

He was the President of Aksyon Demokratiko until his death.

==Death==

On 5 August 2005, Raul Roco died of [[prostate cancer]], at St Luke's Medical Center in [[Quezon City]]. He was buried on August 11 in [[Naga City, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], [[Camarines Sur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20080713-148135/Whats-Sonia-Roco-up-to  showbizandstyle.inquirer.net, What’s Sonia Roco up to?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714060834/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20080713-148135/Whats-Sonia-Roco-up-to |date=2008-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His widow, Sonia, was beaten for [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] under the [[Genuine Opposition]] (formerly United Opposition) umbrella in the [[Philippine general election, 2007|May 14, 2007 midterm elections]] and still representing the party he started, Aksyon Demokratiko, in the hopes of continuing the advocacies that her late husband had started.

'''Richard Nugent, Lord Delvin''' (1742 – 6 August 1761) was an Irish duellist and Member of Parliament.

Nugent was the eldest son and heir of [[Thomas Nugent, 6th Earl of Westmeath]] and adopted the courtesy title of Lord Delvin in 1754 when his father acceded to the earldom.

In 1759, he was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Fore (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Fore]], although he was underage. He was also commissioned a [[cornet (rank)|cornet]] in the [[1st Regiment of Dragoons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Sketches of Old Dublin | first=A. | last=Peter | publisher=Sealy, Bryers &amp; Walker | location=Dublin | year=1907 | pages=78–79 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gjswAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA78 | accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1761, the drunken Lord Delvin accosted a female acquaintance of Capt.

'''Savji Dhanji Dholakia''' ({{lang-gu|સવજી ધનજી ધોળકીયા}}), born 12 April 1962, is the founder and chairman of [[Hari Krishna Exports|Hari Krishna Exports Pvt. Ltd.]], a [[Diamond]] manufacturing and exporting company with manufacturing units at [[Surat]] in [[Gujarat]], [[India]] and its marketing and sales office in [[Mumbai]], [[Maharashtra]] India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-29686366|title=India diamond merchant boss distributes cars as gifts|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/oct/21/-sp-surat-diamond-merchant-india-generous-boss-diwali-hari-krishna|title=Meet the Indian boss who gave cars, apartments and diamonds to employees|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known as Mr. Savji Kaka in the diamond circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Diwali bonanza: Surat boss gifts cars, flats and jewellery as bonus to his employees|url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/Diwali-bonanza-Surat-boss-gifts-cars-flats-and-jewellery-as-bonus-to-his-employees/articleshow/44884418.cms|website = The Times of India|accessdate = 2015-05-21|last = Melvyn Thomas|date = 2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; His company currently exports finished diamonds to more than 50 countries directly from Mumbai. The company also has affiliates in the [[US]], [[Belgium]], [[UAE]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[China]].

==Early life==

Savji Dholakia was raised in a farming family in Dudhala, [[Amreli|Amreli, Gujarat, India]]. Dholakia dropped out of school at 13 and started working at his uncle's diamond business in [[Surat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Newsmaker: Savji Dholakia the diamond exporter everybody wants to join|authors=Vinay Umarji and Kalpesh Damor  |work=Business Standard |date=23 October 2014|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/newsmaker-savji-dholakia-114102300612_1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2015}}
Savji Dholakia joined his paternal uncle who was already engaged in the diamond trade in Surat. His brothers, Himmat and Tulsi, joined him in Surat and they started their own diamond business in 1984. The youngest brother, Ghanshyam, joined 7 years later in 1992.

After 10 years of rigorous diamond polishing work Savji Dholakia formed Hari Krishna Exports in 1992. The sales then were meager. Years later, as of March 2014, the company witnessed a turnover of [[USD]] 650 million (4000 CRORE [[Indian rupee|INR]]) with a 104% growth over the previous year. The total strength of the workers and employees is more than 6,000.

Dholakia is also involved in diamond jewellery manufacturing and exporting H.K. Designs and Unity Jewels. Through H.K. Jewels Pvt. Ltd. the domestic market is being catered to. Kisna Diamond Jewellery is a Pan India brand distributed through more than 480 distributors to more than 6500 retail outlets.

==Achievements==

Savji Dholakia's diamond company is among the top 5 in the industry.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The company has achieved many prestigious awards over the years for their outstanding performance. For instance Hari Krishna Exports Pvt. Ltd. has been recipient of the Gem &amp; Jewellery Export Promotion Council awards for the past 12 consecutive years from 2003–2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hari Krishna Exports Pvt.

==Employee relations==
Dholakia is best known for giving his employees cars, jewellery and homes worth [[USD]] 8 million (50 crore [[Indian rupee|INR]]) as a reward for meeting targets. He gave away 491 cars ([[Fiat Punto]]), 525 pieces of diamond jewellery and 200 apartments to mark the [[Hindu]] festival of [[Diwali]] in October 2014 as bonuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The desi Oprah who gifted 200 homes, 491 cars for Diwali|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/the-desi-oprah-who-gifted-200-homes-491-cars-for-diwali/20141020.htm|website=www.rediff.com|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diwali gift: Flats, cars, jewellery to `loyal staffers’|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/diwali-gift-flats-cars-jewellery-to-loyal-staffers/article6519875.ece|website=www.thehindubusinessline.com|publisher=The Hindu Business Line.|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been rewarding employees of his firm with diamond jewellery, new cars and flats for meeting their annual targets for the last three years. He did it again in October 2015, presenting valuable gifts to selected 1,268 employees.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/surat-businessman-gifts-1260-cars-400-flats-to-employees/432263/|title=Surat businessman gifts 1,260 cars, 400 flats to employees!|date=2016-10-27|newspaper=The Financial Express|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2016 he had gifted 400 flats and 1,260 cars to his employees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Continuing the trend, he gifted three Mercedes-Benz GLS SUVs worth Rs 3 crore to senior three staffers who completed 25 years at the company in September 2018 . On the auspicious occasion of Diwali 2018, he is presenting 600 cars to his employees. 
There is also a news that he asked his son to go out to find a job with meagre 7000 rs. in his pocket. His son did that. He went through the hardship a common man in India goes through in his early years of career. Savjibhai did this to make his son understand the real value of money. As the son of a rich business tycoon, his son had all the amenities. However after going through this turmoil he realized how much money means to him as well as to others.

'''Smax''' is a fictional character from the [[comic book]] series ''[[Top 10 (comics)|Top 10]]'' written by [[Alan Moore]], illustrated by [[Gene Ha]], and published by the [[America's Best Comics]] imprint of [[DC Comics]]. A ''Top-10'' spin-off [[mini-series]] also called ''Smax'' focused on the character and provided him with more of a backstory. In advertisements and interviews leading up to the release of the first issue, the series was referred to as ''Smax the Adventurer''.

==Character history==

'''Jeff Smax''' (born '''Jaafs Macksun''') is a gigantic, blue-skinned, white-haired, super-powered, demi-[[ogre]] policeman who lives and works at Precinct 10, in a city populated by "science-heroes". Smax originally hailed from a land based on fantasy myth and fairy tale legends, but had left after a horrifying failure during his career as a dragon slayer.

Smax is both extremely strong, and invulnerable to most forms of harm, including radiation. Smax is often fairly gruff and guarded amongst his peers, mostly due to the frequent loss of loved ones he has experienced in life (most notably his dear friend and late partner, Stochastic Fats). Though at first very hesitant to become friendly with his new partner, Robyn Slinger AKA "Toybox", he eventually begins to bond with her, even feeling a great need to protect her when she is attacked by Commissioner Ultima and buried under precinct station rubble. The pair are not romantically involved, however, as Smax has an intimate relationship with his twin sister, Rexa. This is not an unusual situation in Smax's home dimension, which has far different laws of physics and science. Rexa, eventually comes to live with Smax and the details of their unique relationship is only known to Robyn, who keeps it secret.

Smax is fairly resourceful in the line of duty, but he has a quick temper and is not intellectually inclined, often not thinking things through. Smax has experience using weaponry, including his Singing Sword, but he most often prefers using his fist, or his Strong Light energy (which emanates from his [[solar plexus]]). 

[[Image:Maiden'smark.jpg|Smax receives the Maiden's Mark.|150 px|left|thumb]]

==Mini-series plot==
The story deals with Smax and Toybox returning, via magical teleportation, to Jeff's magically enchanted homeworld. Smax, now a city dweller, seems embarrassed by his unsophisticated, sword-and-sorcery roots. They attend Smax's uncle's funeral where Jeff introduces Robyn as his wife, though no such relationship exists. At this point Jeff's sister Rexa Macksun is introduced, dressed in the typical garb of a female fantasy barbarian such as [[Red Sonja]] and just as tall and physically impressive as her brother with the same blue skin and white hair. 

It is revealed Jeff has been away from home for some time, having originally left his world fleeing personal and literal demons. Once a great dragon slayer, a job needed to pay the bills for his adopted dwarven family, Smax fails to stop an extremely powerful, shape-shifting dragon named Morning Bright from destroying a little girl. She was burned to ashes in front of him, forever leaving a white burnmark of a hand on his chest. [[Image:Smax 180x270.jpg|right|Trade paperback|150px]]

Further story developments reveal a [[sexual tension]] between Smax and his sister.  The two were born of an unwilling union between a monster and a human warrior woman with magical strength. Despite this, the pressure of twins kills her during childbirth. Her durability is passed on to her children. Their monstrous father would abuse them both and molest the sister, who would also find love and solace in her brother's arms. Smax would eventually kill his father so they could escape together. Though in their medieval homeworld their relationship wasn't particularly frowned upon, Smax developed conflicted feelings about the propriety of their love.

For various reasons, Smax, Rexa, Robyn, and other heroes venture out to destroy Morning Bright. Smax's heroic efforts cause the mark on his chest to be removed.

==Publishing history==
The ''Smax'' miniseries was written by [[Alan Moore]], and pencilled by [[Zander Cannon]], who also inked the first issue. Andrew Currie inked the rest of the miniseries. The title of each issue's story is a line from the [[Syd Barrett]] song "Octopus". 
The series was collected into a hardcover edition ({{ISBN|1-4012-0325-6}}) in 2004 and in paperback ({{ISBN|1-4012-0290-X}}) on November 2, 2005.

'''Subagio Sastrowardoyo''' (1 February 1924 – 18 July 1995) was an Indonesian poet, short-story writer, essayist and literary critic. Born in [[Madiun]], [[East Java]], the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Indonesia), he studied  at [[Gadjah Mada University]], [[Cornell University]] and in 1963 graduated with an MA from [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name="BB1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pusatbahasa.kemdiknas.go.id/lamanv42/?q=node/1155 |title=Subagio Sastrowardoyo |date=31 July 2009 |publisher=Badan Bahasa |accessdate=14 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523011530/http://pusatbahasa.kemdiknas.go.id/lamanv42/?q=node%2F1155 |archivedate=23 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His debut as a writer came early with the publication of ''Simphoni'' (Symphony), a collection of poems, in 1957.&lt;ref name="sub"&gt;{{cite book | title = Walking westward in the morning : seven contemporary Indonesian poets | publisher = Lontar Foundation in collaboration with SOAS | location = Jakarta | year = 1990 | isbn = 979-8083-03-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection has been described as "cynical, untamed poetry, shocking sometimes".&lt;ref name="sub2"&gt;{{cite book | title = Modern Indonesian Literature | last=Teeuw | first=A. |authorlink=A. Teeuw| page=235|publisher = Martinus Nijhoff | location = The Hague | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Simphoni'' was followed by several attempts at short story writing, including the publication ''Kedjananan di Sumbing'' (Manhood on Mount Sumbing), before Subagio settled on [[poetry]] as his main creative outlet.&lt;ref name="sub"/&gt; Following an extended stay in the United States he published a collection of poems entitled ''Saldju'' (Snow) in 1966.&lt;ref name="sub"/&gt; The poems in this collection deal with questions of life and death, and of the need for "something to hold on to in an existence threatened on all sides",&lt;ref name="sub2"/&gt; and have been described as altogether more restrained than those in his earlier work.&lt;ref name="sub2"/&gt; Additional works published since 1966 include ''Daerab Perbatasan'' (Border Region) (1970), ''Keroncong Motinggo'' (Montinggo's Song) (1975), ''Buku Harian'' (Diary), ''Hari dan Hara'' (1979)''Simphoni Dua'' (1990), and several books of literary criticism.&lt;ref name="sub3"&gt;{{cite book | last = Aveling | first = Harry | title = Secrets Need Words | publisher = Ohio University Center for International Studies | location = Athens | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-89680-216-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subagio's collected poems have been published as ''Dan Kematian Makin Akrab'' (1995).&lt;ref name="sub3"/&gt;

From 1958 to 1961 Subagio taught in the Faculty of Letters at [[Gadjah Mada University]].&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt;
He was able to read French, Dutch and English with sufficient fluency to be able to translate poems in these languages into Indonesian, and this allowed him to find employment abroad.&lt;ref name="Teeuw2"&gt;{{cite book | last = Teeuw | first = A. | title = Modern Indonesian Literature. Vol.II | publisher = Martinus Nijhoff | location = The Hague | year = 1979 | isbn = 90-247-2308-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent several years teaching in [[Australia]], firstly as a senior lecturer at Salisbury College of Advanced Education and from 1974 to 1981 he lectured at [[Flinders University]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]].&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt; He also acted as guest instructor at [[Ohio University]], teaching [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. In 1981 he became a member of the Working Group on Socio-Cultural Defense and the Director of Young PN Hall Book Publishing, and from 1982 to 1984 he was a member of the Jakarta Arts Council.&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt; For many years, he was a director of [[Balai Pustaka]], a publishing firm in Indonesia.  In 1987, Subagio Sastrowardoyo, together with [[Goenawan Mohamad]], [[Sapardi Djoko Damono]], [[Umar Kayam]], and [[John H. McGlynn]], established the [[Lontar Foundation]], a non-profit organization with the primary aim of promoting Indonesian [[literature]] and [[culture]] through the [[translation]] of Indonesian literary works.&lt;ref name="JPlontar"&gt;Dewi S. Syahrir. "Lontar Foundation promotes Indonesian literature". ''[[The Jakarta Post]]''. 29 August 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subagio Sastrowardoyo died in [[Jakarta]] on 18 July 1995.&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt;

==Awards and legacy==
*In 1986, Mr. Sastrowardoyo, as a representative of Balai Pustaka, presented the Pegasus Prize for Literature to Ismail Marahimin, author of ''And the War is Over,'' in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/rtsindo2005/20233196/ Rahadyan Sastrowardoyo account on Flickr]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mr. Sastrowardoyo was awarded the [[S.E.A. Write Award]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="SEA"&gt;"{{cite web |url=http://www.seawrite.com/English%20Site/Past%20Events-E/1991-E.html |title=1991 S.E.A Write Awards |date=23 September 1991 |publisher=South East Asian Writers Awards |accessdate=7 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426031822/http://www.seawrite.com/English%20Site/Past%20Events-E/1991-E.html |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A year after his death, Mr. Sastrowardoyo was quoted in an essay by [[Barbara Crossette]] for the Week in Review section of ''The New York Times'':&lt;ref name="NYT1996"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/23/weekinreview/introspection-and-repression-why-indonesia-isn-t-talking.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Subagio%20Sastrowardoyo&amp;st=cse |title=Introspection and Repression;Why Indonesia Isn't Talking
 |last=Crossette |first=Barbara |date=23 June 1996 |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; A few years ago, [John] McGlynn's foundation collected Indonesians' impressions of the United States, many of them unsettling, in a book called ''On Foreign Shores.'' One of the poets, [[Ajip Rosidi]], reacted to New York in a poem titled "Manhattan Sonnet."

"Is it within these strong and rigid walls /
one's sense of safety nestles? /
All I find here is vigilance, the source of apprehension."

His compatriot Subagio Sastrowardoyo wrote about a city "where life is cheap." New York's greed, he said, "has made this place too confined for prayer or a human voice."&lt;ref name="NYT1996"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*The Australian composer [[Betty Beath]] based a composition, "''Manusia Pertama di Angkasa Luar...The First Man in Outer Space''" on a poem by Subagio Sastrowardoyo.&lt;ref name="Beath"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.australianmusiccentre.com.au/product/manusia-pertama-a-luar-first-man-in-outer-space |title=Manusia pertama di angkasa luar=First Man in Outer Space |last1=Sastrowardoyo |first1=Subagio |last2=Beath |first2=Betty |year=1983 |work=Musical score |publisher=Australian Music Centre |accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taj Burrow''' (born 2 June 1978) is an Australian retired professional [[surfing|surfer]]. Taj retired from the [[ASP World Tour]] in June 2016.

==Early life==
Burrow was born in [[Yallingup]], [[Western Australia]], Australia to American parents and began surfing at age 7.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|last=Warshaw|first=Matt|title=The Encyclopedia of Surfing|year=2003|publisher=Harcourt|pages=94|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=-DWQSYRx4MUC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=burrow+surfing+hall+of+fame&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UbeP5yTBDU&amp;sig=rDX3109jfStt_A2dntGrYvlakso&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LkM9TufWOILqgQfM9ID7Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=burrow%20surfing%20hall%20of%20fame&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 10, he discovered he is [[colourblind]].&lt;ref name=Stab&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stabmag.com/news/taj-burrow-living-high-in-the-dirty-biz-of-pro-surfing/|title=Taj Burrow – Living High In The Dirty Biz Of Pro Surfing|author=Elliot Struck|publisher=Stab Magazine|date=5 April 2013|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1998 he qualified for the ASP World Tour at the age of 18 years, becoming the youngest surfer to ever win a national title.&lt;ref name=billabong&gt;{{cite web|title=Team - Taj Burrow|url=http://us.billabong.com/womens/team/member/taj-burrow?id=2|work=Billabong US|publisher=Billabong International Ltd|accessdate=24 September 2013|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burrow had already earned a place on the world tour a year earlier, but he turned it down stating that, as a 17-year-old, he was "too young to do the tour full-on".&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=surfwithtaj&gt;[http://www.surfpix.co.nz/surf-with-taj.php]&lt;/ref&gt; After his first year on tour in 1998, Burrow claimed the ASP World Tour Rookie of the Year award after finishing 12th place in the rankings.&lt;ref name=fuel&gt;[http://www.fuel.tv/shows/castmember/taj-burrow/usopenofsurfing Fuel TV Profile]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929115719/http://www.fuel.tv/shows/castmember/taj-burrow/usopenofsurfing |date=29 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Asp" /&gt;

In 2007 Burrow won the [[Rip Curl Pro]] at [[Bells Beach, Victoria]], Australia.&lt;ref name=theaus&gt;{{cite news|title=Burrow last man standing to ring bell|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/burrow-last-man-standing-to-ring-bell/story-e6frg7mf-1111113332760|accessdate=24 September 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=13 April 2007|author=Margie McDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt; He backed this up with a victory at the 2007 Billabong Pro in [[Jeffrey's Bay]], South Africa, where he claimed the title over the then 8-time world champion, [[Kelly Slater]]. This win helped to secure his 2nd-place ranking on the [[Association of Surfing Professionals|ASP]] Men's Tour, his second runner-up season placing.

In 2009, Burrow defeated Slater in the final of the [[Billabong Pipeline Masters]] at the [[Banzai Pipeline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pushing our Burrow|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/pushing-our-burrow/story-e6frf9if-1225811137745|accessdate=24 September 2013|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=16 December 2009|author=AAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he finished fourth place on the World Tour.&lt;ref name="Asp" /&gt;

Burrow won the 2013 Hurley Pro event in September 2013 for the first time, beating fellow Australian [[Julian Wilson (surfer)|Julian Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taj Burrow Wins The 2013 Hurley Pro|url=http://www.surfingmagazine.com/news/taj-burrow-wins-the-2013-hurley-pro/|work=Surfing Magazine|publisher=GrindMedia, LLC|accessdate=24 September 2013|date=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan was born in [[Cranston, Rhode Island]], and graduated from [[Brown University]] as salutatorian and Class Orator of the class of 1943.  His senior address was on America's duty to "aid in repairing not only the damage suffered by our Allies, but also that sustained by our enemies."&lt;ref&gt;Obbligato: Notes on a Foreign Service Career, William H. Sullivan. W.W. Norton &amp; Co. Inc. New York, 1984, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  After graduation, he entered the Navy and served as a gunnery officer on a destroyer, the ''[[USS Hambleton]]''. The ''Hambleton'' escorted North Atlantic convoys, and served off North Africa and Italy before participating in the D-Day invasion of Normandy and the invasion of Okinawa. He had the senior watch on the Hambleton when it entered Yokohama harbor for the Japanese surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Obbligato, pp. 73 -76.&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining a joint graduate degree from [[Harvard University]] and the [[Fletcher School]] at [[Tufts University]] under the GI Bill, Sullivan joined the Foreign Service and was posted to [[Bangkok]], Thailand.  During that tour, he was in brief communication with the [[Viet Cong]], who were in exile in northern Thailand. His subsequent assignments were to [[Calcutta]], [[India]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], [[Naples]] and [[Rome]], [[Italy]], and [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;His habit of speaking his mind with force and candor grated on more than one superior, and for years he languished in the lower grades.  Then, in the Kennedy administration, he was assigned to the office of [[W. Averell Harriman]], the Assistant Secretary for the Far East.  Harriman, no admirer of blandness, immediately recognized his abilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stewart Alsop]] (1968), ''The Center:  People and Power in Political Washington'', 1968 reprint, New York:  Popular Library, Ch. 5, "The Sad State of State", p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sullivan served as Harriman's deputy at Geneva negotiations about the future of [[Laos]] in 1961 and during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;Obliggato, pp.162-172.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Vietnam War]] heated up, he served briefly as deputy chief of mission to the [[United States Embassy, Saigon|U.S. Embassy in Saigon]].&lt;ref&gt;Obbligato, pp. 197- 208&lt;/ref&gt;

His nephew is [[United States Deputy Secretary of State]] [[John J. Sullivan (diplomat)|John Sullivan]].

==Ambassador to Laos==

In 1964, Sullivan began his tenure as Ambassador to Laos. During his service in Laos, Sullivan broached negotiations with the [[North Vietnam]]ese, capitalizing on his prior contacts with the Viet Cong in Thailand nearly 20 years previously,  for the initiation of the Paris Peace Talks that ended the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;Obbligato, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pursuant to an order by President Kennedy, all U.S. military operations in Laos were under the direct supervision of the Ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;Thecrimson.com/article/1971/2/23/air-war-in-laos&lt;/ref&gt; As Ambassador to Laos during [[Project 404]], and he also personally directed the bombing of the Ho Chi Minh trail. This civilian control and the restriction on  military operations rankled the military.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; 
  
After he left Laos, Sullivan returned to Washington to coordinate the U.S. participation in the Paris Peace Talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/vietnam-fe59dc-interview-with-william-h-william-healy-sullivan-1981 |title=Interview with William H. (William Healy) Sullivan, 1981 - WGBH Open Vault |publisher=Openvault.wgbh.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, he was appointed Ambassador to the Philippines. [[South Vietnam]] fell while he in the [[Philippines]], and Sullivan orchestrated the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people through that nation. He was able to convince President [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] to permit the fleeing South Vietnamese navy to land, despite a demand from the new Communist Vietnamese government for its return, by arguing that the ships were in fact U.S. property after the fall of the South Vietnamese government, as a result of the terms of their sale to that state.&lt;ref&gt;''Obbligato'', p. 254. See also, The Lucky Few, Jan Herman, U.S. Naval Institute {{ISBN|9780870210396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ambassador to Iran==

Sullivan next served as U.S. Ambassador to [[Iran]], arriving just before President Jimmy Carter's visit to the [[Shah of Iran]] in December 1977. In the 1970s, America had extremely close military and economic links with Iran. However, in early 1978, growing unrest due to inflation and other economic hardships fueled by the growing tide of fundamentalist Islam led to demonstrations against the Shah. During the next year, however, as the domestic situation in Iran was rapidly unraveling, Washington had few instructions for the Embassy in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Mission to Iran,  Norton 1981, pp. 154—193. See also, https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/11/30-years-after-the-hostage-crisis.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As the demonstrations increased in scale, Sullivan came into conflict with National Security Advisor [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] over a resolution that would be acceptable to American interests. Sullivan felt that compromise with the demonstrators and the [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] was necessary, while Brzezinski favored strong, unconditional support for the Shah and Iranian Prime Minister [[Shapour Bakhtiar]]. Although Brzezinski got his way, the demonstrators prevailed; in late 1978, Sullivan cabled Washington that it might be necessary to consider policy options if the military proved unable to assure the shah's continuance in power and the shah should depart from Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Mission to Iran. Pp. 203-204.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1979, the White House instructed Sullivan to inform the shah that the U.S. government felt he should leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;Mission to Iran, pp. 227–230.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 1, 1979, the exiled Khomeini returned to Tehran. Days later, with Tehran in revolution and all organs of state essentially nonexistent, Under Secretary of State [[David D. Newsom]] called from the [[White House Situation Room]] with a question for Sullivan:  "The National Security Advisor (Brzezinski) has asked for your view of the possibility of a coup d'état by the Iranian military to take over from the Bakhtiar government, which is clearly faltering."

Sullivan allegedly replied, "Tell Brzezinski to fuck off."

"That's not a very helpful comment," Newsom noted.

"You want it translated into Polish?"  Sullivan hung up.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ken Follett]] (1983), ''On Wings of Eagles'', 1986 reprint, New YorK:  New American Library, Ch. 9, Sec. 2, p. 269, {{ISBN|0-451-14505-4}} .&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 1979, the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|US Embassy in Teheran]] was overrun by several different armed groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://century.theguardian.com/1970-1979/Story/0,,106889,00.html |title=US Embassy stormed by Tehran mob &amp;#124; 1970-1979 &amp;#124; Guardian Century |publisher=Century.theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Embassy staff was briefly taken hostage, but later released to the caretaker Iranian government.&lt;ref&gt;Mission to Iran, pp. 257 – 268. See also, pbs.org/egbh/frontline supra.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote in his autobiography: "I had recommended that we accept the fact that a revolution was in progress and seek to use our not inconsiderable influence to steer its success toward its more moderate protagonists." This view, however, was not shared by Washington, and Sullivan was recalled in March 1979. Shortly after, on April 1, 1979, Iran officially became an [[Islamic Republic]].

After Sullivan left Iran, the Embassy drew down to a skeleton staff, under the direction of Chargé d'Affaires [[Bruce Laingen]], who later became one of 52 Americans [[Iran hostage crisis|held hostage]] by [[Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line|militant Iranian students]]. 

He headed the American Assembly at [[Columbia University]], which had been briefly headed by General [[Dwight Eisenhower]] before he was elected President, from 1979 to 1986. In 1981, Sullivan published Mission to Iran, a memoir of his time as ambassador. His autobiography, ''Obbligato: Notes on a Foreign Service Career'', was published in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Obbligato: Notes on a Foreign Service Career, William H. Sullivan, W.W. Norton &amp; Co., Inc., New York, 1984. {{ISBN|0-393-01809-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==

He later served on the boards of the [[Lincoln Center]], the [[International Center, Dallas|International Center]], and the U.S.- Vietnam Trade Council.

In 1988 he received an overture to begin steps towards U.S.-Vietnam normalization from his former North Vietnamese negotiations counterpart [[Nguyen Co Thach]], who had become [[Vietnam]]'s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.  Sullivan first traveled back to Vietnam in May 1989 to meet with Minister Thach, founded the U.S.-Vietnam Trade Council, and from then continued to work on steps towards the historic normalization.

Following retirement, he lived a quiet life in [[Cuernavaca]], [[Mexico]], and later, [[Washington, D.C.]]

William H. Sullivan died on October 11, 2013, one day before his 91st birthday.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|author=William Branigin |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/william-h-sullivan-dies-at-90-veteran-diplomat-oversaw-secret-war-in-laos/2013/10/22/f13e628c-3b2f-11e3-b6a9-da62c264f40e_story.html |title=William H.

'''Étienne-Denis, duc de Pasquier''' (21 April 1767 – 5 July 1862), ''Chancelier de France'', (a title revived for him by [[Louis-Philippe I, King of the French|Louis-Philippe]] in 1837),  was a French statesman. In 1842, he was elected a member of the [[Académie française]], and in the same year was created a duke by Louis-Philippe.

==Biography==
Born in Paris in a family of the [[Nobles of the Robe|''noblesse de robe'']], with ancestors such as [[Étienne Pasquier]], he was destined for the legal profession and was educated at the ''[[Collège de Juilly]]'' near Paris. He then became a counsellor of the [[Parlement|''parlement de Paris'']], and witnessed many of the incidents that marked the growing hostility between that body and [[Louis XVI of France]] in the years preceding the [[French Revolution]] of 1789.

His views were those of a moderate reformer, determined to preserve the [[House of Bourbon]] in a renovated France; his memoirs depict in a favorable light the actions of his ''parlement'' (an institution soon to be abolished towards the end of the year 1789, under growing revolutionary pressures).

For some time, and especially during the [[Reign of Terror]] (1793–1794), Pasquier remained in obscurity; but this did not save him from arrest nor his father from execution in the year 1794.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862|year=1863|publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Company|location=New York|page=699|url=https://archive.org/stream/1862appletonsan02newyuoft#page/n705/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was incarcerated for two months in the [[Prison Saint-Lazare|Saint-Lazare Prison]] shortly before the start of [[Thermidorian Reaction]], and released after the fall and execution of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] at the end of July 1794.

==Empire==
He did not re-enter the public service until the period of the [[First French Empire]], when the arch-chancellor [[Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès]] used his influence with [[Napoleon I]] to procure for him the office of ''[[maître des requêtes]]'' to the [[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]. In 1809, he became [[baron]] of the Empire, and in February 1810 counsellor of State. In October 1810, the Emperor made him [[Prefecture of Police|prefect of police]] of Paris.

The main challenge of his career was the strange [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] of the [[Republicanism|republican]] general [[Claude François de Malet]] (October 1812); Malet, spreading false news that Napoleon had died in the [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|Russian campaign]], managed to surprise and capture some of the ministers and other authorities in Paris, among them Pasquier. However, the attempt's manifest failure enabled Pasquier to speedily regain his liberty.

==Restoration and July Monarchy==
When Napoleon abdicated in April 1814, Pasquier continued to exercise his functions for a few days in order to preserve order, and then resigned from the prefecture of police, whereupon [[Louis XVIII of France]] allotted to him the ''[[Corps of Bridges and Roads (France)|Corps des Ponts et Chaussées]]''. He distanced himself from the Imperial restoration at the time of the [[Hundred Days]] (1815), and, after the final [[Bourbon Restoration]], became [[List of Justice Ministers of France|Keeper of the Seal]] (July 1815). Finding it impossible to work with the [[Ultra-royalist]]s of the [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber of Deputies]] (the ''[[Chambre introuvable]]''), he resigned office in September. Under the more moderate ministers of succeeding years, he again held various appointments, but refused to join the [[reactionary]] cabinets of the close of the reign of [[Charles X of France]].

After the [[July Revolution]] (1830), he became president of the [[Peerage of France|Chamber of Peers]] a post which he held through the whole of the reign of [[Louis-Philippe I, King of the French|Louis-Philippe]] (1830–1848). After the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|abdication of Louis-Philippe]] in February 1848, ''Chancelier Pasquier'' retired from active life and set to work to compile the notes and reminiscences of his long and active career. He died in Paris at the age of ninety-five on 5 July 1862.
