--&gt;
This article presents lists of the literary events and publications in '''1599'''.

==Events==
*[[January 13]] – [[Edmund Spenser]] dies in London, followed by burial in the [[Poets' Corner]] at [[Westminster Abbey]].
*Spring/Summer – [[Globe Theatre]] built in [[Southwark]], [[London]], utilising material from [[The Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Cassell's Chronology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Hywel|title=Cassell's Chronology of World History|location=London|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|year=2005|isbn=0-304-35730-8|pages=233–238}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[June 4]] – The [[Bishops' Ban of 1599]]: [[Thomas Middleton|Middleton]]'s ''[[Microcynicon: Six Snarling Satires]]'' and [[John Marston (poet)|Marston]]'s ''Scourge of Villainy'' are publicly burned as the English ecclesiastical authorities crack down on the craze for satire in the past year. [[Richard Bancroft]], [[Bishop of London]] and [[John Whitgift]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] tighten their enforcement of existing censorship. Earlier, minor works like pamphlets and plays were being published only with the approval of the Wardens of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers Company]], and without ecclesiastical review; this arrangement is terminated.
*[[June 7]] – [[John Day (dramatist)|John Day]] kills fellow playwright [[Henry Porter (playwright)|Henry Porter]], allegedly in self-defence.
*[[September 21]] – First recorded performance of Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' at the [[Globe Theatre]] in [[London]], reported by Swiss traveller [[Thomas Platter the Younger]].
*Late – [[War of the Theatres]]: [[Satire]], being prohibited in print, breaks out in the London theatres. In [[Histriomastix (play)|''Histriomastix'']], Marston satirizes [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]]’s pride through the character Chrisoganus; Jonson responds by satirizing Marstons's wordy style in ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]'', acted by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]].&lt;ref&gt;A reverse sequence of events is argued in: {{cite journal|last=Bednarz|first=James|title=Marston's Subversion of Shakespeare and Jonson: Histriomastix and the War of the Theaters|journal=Medieval &amp; Renaissance Drama in England|volume=6|location=New York|publisher=AMS Press|year=1993|pages=103–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The English comic actor [[William Kempe|Will Kempe]] leaves the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] earlier in the year, to be replaced by [[Robert Armin]] by its end (probably).
*[[James VI and I|King James VI of Scotland]] arranges for a company of English players to erect a playhouse and perform in his country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=S.|last=Carpenter|chapter=Scottish drama until 1650|editor=Brown, I. |title=The Edinburgh Companion to Scottish Drama|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2011|isbn=0748641076|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fashion in the period 1660–1700''' in [[Western Europe]]an [[clothing]] is characterized by rapid change. The style of this era is known as Baroque. Following the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[England's]] [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], military influences in men's clothing were replaced by a brief period of decorative exuberance which then sobered into the [[coat (clothing)|coat]], [[waistcoat]] and [[breeches]] costume that would reign for the next century and a half. In the normal cycle of fashion, the broad, high-waisted silhouette of the [[1600–1650 in fashion|previous period]] was replaced by a long, lean line with a low waist for both men and women. This period also marked the rise of the [[Wig (hair)|periwig]] as an essential item of men's fashion.


== Women's fashion ==
[[File:Portrait of Suzanna Doublet-Huygens by Caspar Netscher.jpg|thumb|right|Susanna Huygens wore a long, tight white satin bodice with paned sleeves lined in pink and a matching petticoat. Her hair is worn in a mass of tight curls, and she wears pearl eardrops and a pearl necklace. 1667–69.]]
[[File:Barbara Palmer (née Villiers), Duchess of Cleveland by John Michael Wright.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland|Barbara Viliers]], mistress of King Charles II, painted by [[John Michael Wright]] c. 1670 in the romantic style.]]

=== Overview ===
The wide, high-waisted look of the [[1600–1650 in fashion|previous period]] was gradually superseded by a long vertical line, with horizontal emphasis at the shoulder. Full, loose [[sleeve]]s ended just below the elbow at mid century and became longer and tighter in keeping with the new trend. The body was tightly [[corset]]ed, with a low, broad neckline and dropped shoulder. In later decades, the [[overskirt]] was drawn back and pinned up to display the [[petticoat]], which was heavily decorated.

Spanish court fashion remained out of step with the fashions that arose in France and England, and prosperous [[Holland]] also retained its own modest fashions, especially in headdress and hairstyles, as it had retained the [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]] in the previous period.

=== Romantic negligence ===
A daring new fashion arose for having one's portrait painted in ''undress'', wearing a loosely fastened [[gown]] called a ''nightgown'' over a voluminous [[chemise]], with tousled curls. The style is epitomized by the portraits of [[Peter Lely]], which derive from the romanticized style originated by [[Anthony van Dyck]] in the 1630s. The clothing in these portraits is not representative of what was worn on the street or at court.&lt;ref&gt;Gordenker, ''Van Dyck and the Representation of Dress in Seventeenth-Century Portraiture''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Marly, "Undress in the Œuvre of Lely"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mantua ===
The ''[[mantua (clothing)|mantua]]'' or ''manteau'' was a new fashion that arose in the 1680s. Instead of a bodice and skirt cut separately, the mantua hung from the shoulders to the floor (in the manner of dresses of earlier periods) started off as the female version of the men's [[Banyan (clothing)|Banyan]], worn for 'undress' wear. Gradually it developed into a draped and pleated dress and eventually evolved into a dress worn looped and draped up over a contrasting petticoat and a stomacher. The mantua-and-stomacher resulted in a high, square neckline in contrast to the broad, off-the-shoulder neckline previously in fashion. The new look was both more modest and covered-up than previous fashions and decidedly fussy, with bows, frills, ribbons, and other trim, but the short string of pearls and pearl earrings or ''eardrops'' worn since the 1630s remained popular.

The mantua, made from a single length of fabric pleated to fit with a long train, was ideal for showing the designs of the new elaborately patterned silks that replaced the solid-colored satins popular in mid-century.&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro, Aileen, on the origins of the mantua in the late 17th century, in ''Dress in Eighteenth Century Europe 1715–1789''; Ashelford, Jane, ''The Art of Dress''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hunting and riding dress ===

In a June 1666 diary entry, [[Samuel Pepys]] describes the Maids of Honour in their [[riding habit]]s of mannish coats, doublets, hats, and periwigs, "so that, only for a long petticoat dragging under their men's coats, nobody could take them for women in any point whatever". For riding [[Sidesaddle|side-saddle]], the costume had a long, trailing petticoat or skirt. This would be looped up or replaced by an ankle-length skirt for shooting or walking.

=== Hairstyles and headgear ===
Early in the period, hair was worn in a bun at the back of the head with a cluster of curls framing the face. The curls grew more elaborate through the 1650s, then longer, until curls were hanging gracefully on the shoulder. In the 1680s hair was parted in the center with height over the temples, and by the 1690s hair was unparted, with rows of curls stacked
high over the forehead.

This hairstyle was often topped with a ''[[fontange]]'', a frilly cap of lace wired to stand in vertical tiers with streamers to either side, named for [[Angélique de Fontanges|a mistress of the French King]]. This was popular from the 1690s to the first few years of the 18th century.

== Men's fashion ==

=== Overview ===

With the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the fashions of the 1650s and early 1660s imitated the new peaceful and more relaxed feeling in Europe. The military [[boot]]s gave way to shoes, and a mania for baggy breeches, short coats, and hundreds of yards of ribbon set the style. The breeches (see [[Petticoat breeches]]) became so baggy that [[Samuel Pepys]] wrote in his diary: "And among other things, met with Mr. Townsend, who told of his mistake the other day to put both his legs through one of his Knees of his breeches, and so went all day." (April 1661) The wide breeches that made such an error possible were soon being gathered at the knee: Pepys noted, 19 April 1663 "this day put on my close-kneed coloured suit, which, with new stockings of the colour, with belt, and new gilt-handled sword, is very handsome." This era was also one of great variation and transition.

In 1666, [[Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland]], following the earlier example of [[Louis XIV of France]], decreed that at court, men were to wear a long coat, a [[waistcoat|vest or waistcoat]] (originally called a ''petticoat'', a term which later became applied solely to women's dress), a [[necktie|cravat]], a [[wig (hair)|periwig or wig]], and [[breeches]] gathered at the knee, as well as a [[hat]] for outdoor wear. By 1680, this more sober uniform-like outfit of coat, waistcoat, and breeches became the norm for formal dress.

=== Coat and waistcoat ===
The unfitted looser fit of the [[1600–1650 in fashion|1640s]] continued into the 1650s. In the 1650s, [[sleeve]]s ranged from above to below the elbow. The sleeves could be slashed, unslashed, or dividing into two parts and buttoned together. The length of the coat reached the waist but by the late 1650s and early 1660s, the coat became very short, only reaching the bottom of the rib cage, much like a bolero jacket. During the 1660s, the sleeves varied a lot from elbow length to no sleeves at all. The coat could be worn opened or buttoned in the front. One common factor were many yards of ribbon loops arranged on the shoulders and the lower parts of the sleeves.

A longer and rather baggy coat (still with sleeves rarely going below the elbow) made an appearance in the early 1660s and as the decade progressed became the most popular coat. By the late 1660s, an upturned cuff became popular although the sleeves had still remained above the elbows. By the 1670s, a vest or waistcoat was worn under the coat. It was usually made of contrasting, often luxurious, fabric, and might have a plain back since that was not seen under the coat. It was a long garment which by the 1680s reached just above the knees. With the end of the 1670s the sleeves became longer and the coat more fitted. The 1680s saw larger upturned cuffs and the waist of the coat became much wider. The coat could have lapels or none. This coat is known as the ''[[justacorps]]''. The pockets on both sides of the coats were arranged horizontally or vertically (especially the mid to late 1680s) until the 1690s when the pockets were usually always arranged horizontally. The waistcoat could be sleeveless or have long sleeves. Typically, a long-sleeved waistcoat was worn in winter for added warmth. By the mid-1680s, ribbons were reduced to one side of the shoulder until by the 1690s, they were gone.

=== Shirt, collar and cravat ===
The ruffled long-sleeved white [[shirt]] remained the only constant throughout the period, although less of it was seen with the advent of the waistcoat.

During the early to mid-1650s, a rather small falling [[collar (clothing)|collar]] was in fashion. This increased in size and encompassed much of the shoulders by 1660. [[Cravat]]s and [[Jabot (neckwear)|jabots]] around the neck started to be worn during the early 1660s (initially with the falling collar). By the mid-1660s, the collar had disappeared with just the cravat remaining, sometimes tied with a small bow of ribbon. Red was the most common color for the bow, although pink, blue, and other colors were also used. By the 1670s, the bow of ribbons had increased in size and in the 1680s, the bow of ribbons became very large and intricate with many loops of ribbon. By the mid-1690s, the very large bow of ribbons was discarded. Also, a new style of cravat made its appearance in the 1690s, the ''Steinkerk'' (named after the [[Steenkerque|Battle of Steenkerque]] in 1692). Before, the cravat was always worn flowing down the chest; the Steinkerk cravat looped through a buttonhole of the coat.

=== Breeches and stockings ===
The previous decade saw [[Spanish breeches]] as the most popular. These were stiff breeches which fell above or just below the knee and were rather moderately fitted. By the mid-1650s, in Western Europe, much looser, uncollected breeches, called [[petticoat breeches]] became the most popular. As the 1650s progressed, they became larger and looser, very much giving the impression of a lady's [[petticoat]]. They were usually decorated with many yards of ribbon around the waist and around the ungathered knee on the outside of the leg. Alongside the petticoat breeches, a collected but still loose fitted breeches called [[rhinegraves]], were also worn. By the early 1660s, their popularity surpassed petticoat breeches. They were usually worn with an overskirt over them. The overskirt was heavily decorated with ribbon on the waist and the bottom of the skirt. Its length was usually just above the knee, but could also extend past the knee so that the rhinegraves underneath could not be seen and only the bottom of the stocking-tops was visible.

With the rising popularity of the longer coat and waistcoat, the large collected rhinegraves and overskirt were abandoned in favor of more close fitting breeches. By the late 1670s, close fitted breeches were worn with the stockings worn over them and on or above the knee, often being gartered with a garter below the knee. With the long waistcoat and stockings worn over the knee, very little of the breeches could be seen. A possible reason that the stockings were worn over the knee, was to give the impression of longer legs since the waist coat fell very low, just above the knee. The breeches tended to be of the same material as the coat. The stockings varied in color.

=== Footwear and accessories ===
Shoes again became the most popular footwear during the 1650s, although boots remained in use for riding and outdoor pursuits. ''[[Boothose]]'', originally of linen with lace cuffs and worn over the fine silk stockings to protect them from wear, remained in fashion even when boots lost their popularity. Boothose lasted well in the mid-1660s, attached right under where the rhinegraves were gathered below the knee, or fashionably slouched and unfastened. Shoes from the 1650s through the 1670s tended to be square toed and slightly long in appearance. Usually the shoes were tied with ribbon and decorated with bows. By the 1680s, the shoe became a bit more fitted; the heel increased in height (with red heels being very popular, especially for attendance at Court), and only a small ribbon if any remained.

The [[baldric]] (a sword hanger worn across one shoulder) was worn until the mid-1680s, when it was replaced by the sword belt (a sword hanger worn across the hips).

=== Hairstyles ===
[[File:Ex-voto a sainte-genevieve -Detail-Largilliere.jpg|right|thumb|The elaborate wig of the 1690s]]
Throughout the period, men wore their hair long with curls well past the shoulders. The bangs (fringe) were usually combed forward and allowed to flow over the forehead a bit. Although men had worn wigs for years to cover up thinning hair or baldness, the popularity of the wig or periwig as standard wardrobe is usually credited to King Louis XIV of France. Louis started to go bald at a relatively young age and had to cover up his baldness with wigs. His early wigs very much imitated what were the hairstyles of the day, but they gave a thicker and fuller appearance than natural hair. Due to the success of the wigs, other men started to wear wigs as well. By 1680, a part in the middle of the wig became the norm. The hair on either side of the part continued to grow in the 1680s until by the 1690s two very high pronounced points developed on the forehead. As well, during the 1680s, the wig was divided into three parts: the front including the center part and the long curls which fell well past the shoulders, the back of the head which was combed rather close to the head, and a mass of curls which flowed down the shoulders and back. The curls of the wig throughout the 1660s until 1700 were rather loose. Tighter curls would not make their appearance until after 1700. Every natural color of wig was possible. Louis XIV tended to favor a brown wig. His son, [[Louis, the Grand Dauphin|Monseigneur]] was well known for wearing blond wigs. Facial hair declined in popularity during this period although thin moustaches remained popular up until the 1680s.

=== Hats and headgear ===
[[Hat]]s vary greatly during this period. Hats with very tall crowns, derived from the earlier [[capotain]] but with flat crowns, were popular until the end of the 1650s. The brims varied as well. Hats were decorated with feathers. By the 1660s, a very small hat with a very low crown, little brim, and large amount of feathers was popular among the French courtiers. Later in the 1660s, very large brims and moderate crowns became popular. Sometimes one side of the brim would be turned up. These continued fashionable well into the 1680s. From the 1680s until 1700, various styles and combinations of upturned brims were in fashion, from one brim upturned to three brims upturned (the ''tricorne''). Even the angle at which the brims were situated on the head varied. Sometimes with a tricorne, the point would meet over the forehead or it would be set at a 45 degree angle from the forehead.

ArtPremium is an independent, ad-free, sales-driven magazine focused on exhibitions and the international contemporary art market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/6269989|title=Art premium : la revista de arte de Puerto Rico in Stanford University Libraries catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latindex.org/latindex/ficha?folio=13563|title=Latindex|last=Regional On Line Information System for Latin American Scientific Reviews|first=el Caribe|date=1997-02-17|website=Bases de datos de revistas nacionales|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://frontart.org/2017/03/11/the-front-row-triennial/|title=The Front Row Triennial|date=2017-03-11|work=FRONT International: Cleveland Triennial for Contemporary Art|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was created by Corinne Timsit and Eric Bonici in 2003 in Puerto Rico and is now based in [[Paris]] since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://conucopr.org/Search.do;jsessionid=14DB0DB714CFD7348986602033FFEE86?query=Bonici,+Eric&amp;scope=author_browse&amp;b_ind=0|title=Indices Conuco de Puerto Rico|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ArtPremium begins as a magazine in Spanish dedicated to the Puerto Rican art scene, its first issues are subtitled: ''La revista de arte de Puerto Rico''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/6269989|title=Art premium : la revista de arte de Puerto Rico in Stanford University Libraries catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ArtPremium remain the art magazine of Puerto Rico until 2008, when Corinne Timsit and Eric Bonici decide to internationalize the magazine.

In 2006, the magazine ArtPremium organizes and produces in [[Puerto Rico]], the first retrospective of [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/artnetnews/artnetnews10-24-06.asp|title=Artnet News - artnet Magazine|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/40871/basquiat-an-anthology-for-puerto-rico/|title=Basquiat: An anthology for Puerto Rico - Announcements - e-flux|website=www.e-flux.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exhibition takes place at the Muséo de arte de Puerto Rico in order to pay a national tribute to Jean-Michel Basquiat (born in [[New York (state)|New York]]), who was of Puerto Rican origins by his mother. Lourdes I Ramos-Rivas (named in 2016 president of the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach), as chief curator of the museum, is also the curator of this retrospective which brings together more than 135 original works by JMB, and contributes to the book: ''Jean-Michel Basquiat, an anthology for Puerto Rico'', also produced by ArtPremium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-molaa-lourdes-ramos-20170320-story.html|title=Lourdes Ramos named president of the Museum of Latin American Art — first Latina to hold the post|website=www.latimes.com|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tmlarts.com/jean-michel-basquiat/|title=Jean-Michel Basquiat|website=www.tmlarts.com|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abaa.org/book/1086387996|title=ABAA {{!}} Jean-Michel Basquiat: Una Antologia para Puerto Rico by BASQUIAT {{!}} Search for rare books|website=www.abaa.org|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/jean-michel-basquiat-una-antologia-para-puerto-rico/oclc/156945938|title=Jean-Michel Basquiat: una antología para Puerto Rico.|last=Basquiat|first=Jean Michel|last2=Navarra|first2=Enrico|last3=Ramos Collado|first3=Lilliana|last4=Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico (San Juan|first4=P.R.)|date=2006|publisher=Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico : ArtPremium|isbn=0615134637|location=San Juan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the entire spring issue is dedicated to [[Kiro Urdin]] to celebrate the long term achievements in his international career. During an interview, and to the question of what he thought to be so exposed, Urdin will say: "It doesn't happen frequently to the artists, but it is good when an important magazine is dedicated to one artist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/4798605|title=Kiro Urdin ArtPremium Collection|website=Vimeo|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Website artpremium.com ==
Between 2011 and 2015, ArtPremium abandons its paper version to focus on its digital development,  the magazine becomes completely free and readable online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.el-status.com/knowledge.html|title=El Status - Independent Platform for Contemporary Puerto Rican Art|website=www.el-status.com|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results having been inconclusive, the paper version of the magazine returns in 2016 with a new English-language version. The ArtPremium website is now an extension of the paper review, it includes uploads of unpublished articles and a layout adapted to digital reading.

==ArtPremium TV==
Since 2008, ArtPremium has been broadcasting its ArtPremium TV channel on the [[vimeo]] social network. Web-based content can be used to relay artist interviews such as [[Kiro Urdin]], [[Carlos Betancourt]] or [[Aziz + Cucher]], exhibition montage views, or reports on contemporary art fairs such as FIAC.

'''''Being John Malkovich''''' is a 1999 American [[fantasy film|fantasy]] [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Spike Jonze]] and written by [[Charlie Kaufman]], both making their feature film debut. The film stars [[John Cusack]], [[Cameron Diaz]], and [[Catherine Keener]], with [[John Malkovich]] and [[Charlie Sheen]] as themselves. The film follows a puppeteer who finds a portal that leads into Malkovich's mind.

Released by [[USA Films]], the film was nominated in three categories at the [[72nd Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Jonze, [[Best Original Screenplay]] for Kaufman and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Keener.

== Plot ==
Craig Schwartz is an unemployed puppeteer in a forlorn marriage with his pet-obsessed wife Lotte. Gaining a file clerk job through Dr. Lester at LesterCorp, in the strange Floor {{frac|7|1|2}} low-ceiling offices of the Mertin-Flemmer Building in New York City, he develops an attraction to his coworker Maxine Lund, who does not return his affections. Craig discovers and enters a small door hidden behind a filing cabinet, and crawls down a tunnel. Suddenly he is quickly drawn into the opposite end of the tunnel,  and finds himself in the mind of actor [[John Malkovich]].

Craig is able to observe and sense whatever Malkovich does for fifteen minutes before he is ejected and dropped into a ditch near the [[New Jersey Turnpike]]. He reveals the portal to Maxine, who sees the profit in it, and they let others use it for $200 a turn.

Craig tells Lotte, who becomes obsessed with the experience, which had allowed her to live out her [[transgender]] desires. Lotte becomes attracted to Maxine when she is experiencing Malkovich, and she and Malkovich begin a sexual relationship with Lotte inside Malkovich's head while Maxine and Malkovich have sex. Craig, forsaken by both women, binds and gags Lotte and locks her in a cage with the chimpanzee, then enters Malkovich's mind and has sex with Maxine.

Soon Craig, with his expert puppeteer skills, discovers that he is able to control Malkovich's actions while in his head. This causes the actor to feel paranoid that he is being controlled by someone else. After Malkovich consults with his friend [[Charlie Sheen]], Malkovich trails Maxine to the Mertin-Flemmer building, where he himself tries the portal into his own head. He finds himself in a world where everyone has his face and they only say "Malkovich", and views his own lifetime history. He is then ejected and meets Craig by the turnpike. Malkovich demands that the portal be closed, but Craig refuses.

Lotte escapes with the help of her pet chimpanzee, who learned how to untie knots in Africa during a zoological capture, which is shown viewed from the chimpanzee's point of view. Lotte phones Maxine, revealing that it was Craig having sex with her while inside Malkovich. Maxine is annoyed but accepts it, because she enjoyed the experience.

Seeking help, Lotte finds Lester, who reveals himself to be Captain Mertin, the original founder of LesterCorp. Lester is aware of the portal, and has a room dedicated to Malkovich's life. Lester explains that the person who is connected to the portal becomes "ripe" for lasting occupation by others on the eve of their 44th birthday. However, when the host turns 44, the portal immediately moves to its next host, an unborn child.

If it is possible for a person to take advantage of the "ripe" host and enter the portal then, one can greatly increase one's lifespan, and then  one can eventually move on to another host. However, if one misses the brief window of "ripeness", and enters the portal even a minute too late, one will find oneself trapped within the unborn child who will be the next host. Lester, who has been using the portal in order to prolong his life, reveals his plan to use Malkovich when "ripe" as the host for him and several of his elderly friends. Offered the chance to join Lester's group, Lotte warns him that Craig currently has control of Malkovich.

Craig finds he is able to remain in Malkovich indefinitely. He spends the next eight months in Malkovich's body, and using his puppeteer's control, he is able to turn Malkovich into a world-class puppeteer. Malkovich marries Maxine. He learns that she is pregnant as their relationship grows distant.

As Malkovich's 44th birthday approaches, Lester and his friends cut a deal with Maxine, and fake her kidnapping. They call up Craig, threatening to kill her if Craig does not leave Malkovich. Craig ends the call, causing Lester to think that he is calling their bluff. Lotte loses hope and attempts to kill Maxine, but they end up at the turnpike after falling through the portal and through Malkovich's shame-ridden subconscious. Maxine reveals to Lotte that Maxine conceived when Lotte was inside Malkovich's body, and she kept the child because it is "theirs". The revelation cements their love for each other.

Craig calls Lester back, thinking Maxine is still in danger. Realizing his opportunity, Lester continues his bluff, convincing Craig to leave Malkovich's body. Lester and his friends enter the portal, taking control of Malkovich. Craig, discovering that Lotte and Maxine are together again, decides to enter the portal to become Malkovich and regain Maxine, however he has unknowingly missed the deadline for getting into Malkovich. Years later, an aging Malkovich, containing the collective mind of Lester and his friends, reveals to Sheen a plan to prolong their lives via Maxine's daughter Emily, within whom Craig is now permanently trapped. Through Emily's eyes Craig is forced to watch Maxine and Lotte living happily together as he futilely pleads that Emily look away.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
Kaufman's idea of ''Being John Malkovich'' originated simply as "a story about a man who falls in love with someone who is not his wife." Gradually he added further elements to the story which he found entertaining, such as floor 7½ of the Mertin Flemmer building; among his first ideas, Malkovich was "nowhere to be seen".&lt;ref name="Salon" /&gt; He wrote the script [[Spec script|on spec]] in 1994 and though it was widely read by [[production company]] and [[film studio]] executives, all turned it down.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; Hoping to find a producer, Kaufman sent the script to Francis Ford Coppola, who passed it on to his then-son-in-law Spike Jonze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Being John Malkovich'' a quirky wonder |work=[[Arizona Daily Star]] |url=http://azstarnet.com/entertainment/movies/article_ee681184-48ef-558a-956f-8f431ab4dc0c.html |first=Phil |last=Villarreal |date=January 7, 2007 |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonze first read the script in 1996 and had agreed to direct the film by 1997.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt; Jonze brought the script to [[Propaganda Films]], which agreed to produce the film in partnership with production company Single Cell Pictures.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt; Single Cell producers [[Michael Stipe]] and [[Sandy Stern]] pitched the film to numerous studios, including [[New Line Cinema]], who dropped the project after chairman [[Robert Shaye]] asked: "Why the fuck can't it be ''Being [[Tom Cruise]]''?".&lt;ref name="Advocate" /&gt; Jonze revealed in a September 2013 interview that Malkovich asked him the same question during their first meeting and also relayed Malkovich's attitude after filming commenced:

{{quote|Either the movie's a bomb and it's got not only my name above the title but my name in the title, so I'm fucked that way; or it does well and I'm just forever associated with this character.&lt;ref name="Chris"&gt;{{cite news |title=Spike Jonze on letting ''Her'' rip and ''Being John Malkovich'' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/sep/09/spike-jonze-her-scarlett-johansson |accessdate=September 13, 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=September 9, 2013 |first=Chris |last=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jonze explained in the same interview that he didn't realize how brave Malkovich's performance in the film was.&lt;ref name="Chris" /&gt;

With a budget of $10 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Write Stuff: Sea change for scribe's future |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117801689.html |first=Jonathan |last=Bing |date=June 19, 2001 |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[principal photography]] of ''Being John Malkovich'' began on July 20, 1998, and continued through August.&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Filming"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bean, Place in ''Malkovich'' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117479351.html |first=Benedict |last=Carver |date=August 10, 1998 |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming took place primarily in [[Los Angeles]];&lt;ref name="Filming" /&gt; specific locations included the [[University of Southern California]] campus and the Observation Bar on board the [[RMS Queen Mary|RMS ''Queen Mary'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Campuses a favorite locale for filming |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/sep/12/local/me-125locations12 |first=Steve |last=Padilla |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Queen Mary: Location Filming |work=[[RMS Queen Mary|QueenMary.com]] |url=http://www.queenmary.com/Filming-Locations.aspx |accessdate=November 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126200422/http://queenmary.com/Filming-Locations.aspx |archivedate=November 26, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The puppets in the film were created by Kamela Portuges and Images in Motion.

===Casting===
Diaz's [[make-up artist]] Gucci Westman described styling Diaz in the role as "a challenge, to make her look homely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=5 Minutes with Gucci Westman |work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue Australia]] |url=http://www.vogue.com.au/beauty/five+minutes+with/5+minutes+with+gucci+westman,2819 |first=Sigourney |last=Cantelo |date=March 11, 2010 |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script included minimal physical descriptions of characters, and thus when Diaz took up the role she did not know that "people weren't going to recognize me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cameron Diaz and Catherine Keener |work=CrankyCritic.com |url=http://www.crankycritic.com/qa/diaz_keener.html |first=Paul |last=Fischer |accessdate=November 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107062624/http://www.crankycritic.com/qa/diaz_keener.html |archivedate=January 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cusack read the film's script after he had asked his [[Talent agent|agent]] to present him with the "craziest, most unproduceable script you can find." Impressed with the script, he asked his agent to follow its progress and book him an audition, with which he won the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Cusack |work=[[The A.V.

Keener cited ''Being John Malkovich'' as an instance of her taking up a role based on the director's previous work.

Spike Jonze makes a [[cameo appearance]] as Derek Mantini's assistant; Mantini is billed in the story as the greatest puppeteer in the history of the world and arouses Schwartz's envy. [[Brad Pitt]] also has a half-second-long [[Cameo appearance|cameo]], as a miffed star in the documentary on Malkovich's career, who seems to be on the verge of saying something before the shot ends. [[Sean Penn]] appears as a fictionalized version of himself and a fan of Malkovich's puppeteer work. Film director [[David Fincher]] makes an uncredited appearance as Christopher Bing in the American Arts &amp; Culture [[pseudo-documentary]] on John Malkovich. [[Winona Ryder]], [[Andy Dick]], and the members of [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] can be seen in the audience of a Malkovich puppet show.&lt;ref name="IMDb"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120601/fullcredits#cast |title=''Being John Malkovich'' (1999) – Full Cast &amp; Crew |work=[[IMDb]] |publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie has ideas enough for half a dozen films, but Jonze and his cast handle them so surely that we never feel hard-pressed; we're enchanted by one development after the next" and he also felt that "Either ''Being John Malkovich'' gets nominated for best picture, or the members of the Academy need portals into their brains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/being-john-malkovich-1999|title=''Being John Malkovich'' Review|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|date=October 29, 1999|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Roger Ebert|RogerEbert.com]]|accessdate=August 27, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another top critic [[Peter Rainer]], writing for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', commented that "dazzlingly singular movies aren't often this much fun" in his review,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rainer |first=Peter |title=Get Outta My Face |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/reviews/1362 |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |date=November 8, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Owen Gleiberman]], writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', called it "the most excitingly original movie of the year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |title=''Being John Malkovich'' Review |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,271590,00.html |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=December 17, 2010 |date=November 12, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to ''Get Out''==
{{main|Get Out}}
Following the financial and critical success of the 2017 film ''Get Out'', varying fan theories arose delving into the social horror themes of the film. In December of that year, the film's writer/director/producer [[Jordan Peele]] had an interview with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in which he discussed the major fan theories surrounding the film, confirming which of the most popular were true and false. Peele stated that he and ''Being John Malkovich'' director [[Spike Jonze]] had discussed the theory that ''Get Out'' was a secret [[stand-alone sequel]] to ''Being John Malkovich'', and, although admitting that ''Get Out'' was never conceived as a sequel to ''Being John Malkovich'' or thought of as such until after the film was released, Peele stated that since hearing the theory both himself and Jonze viewed the connection as both films being set in the same continuity, saying that "as far as I'm concerned, it's true".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBvcngHRTFg | title = Jordan Peele Breaks Down "Get Out" Fan Theories from Reddit | publisher = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | date = December 1, 2017 | accessdate = December 4, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory states that [[Catherine Keener]]'s "Maxine" in ''Being John Malkovich'' is the same character as "Missy" in ''Get Out''; ''Being John Malkovich'' concludes with Maxine and Lotte raising a child fathered by John Malkovich, but unbeknownst to them, the spirit of Craig is trapped inside the child's mind. With the portal to Malkovich's mind officially closed, they sought out other avenues for mind-transplant experimentation, eventually coming across Roman Armitage ([[Richard Herd]]), a neurosurgeon. Lotte entered the body of Dean Armitage ([[Bradley Whitford]]), Roman's son, and Emily, combined with the spirit of Craig, living in his own "Sunken Place", grows up to become the malevolent sociopath that is Rose Armitage ([[Allison Williams (actress)|Allison Williams]]), all completely complicit in the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1733729/jordan-peele-confirms-hilarious-get-out-theory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://screenrant.com/get-out-jordan-peele-fan-theory-being-john-malkovich/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://io9.gizmodo.com/watch-jordan-peele-respond-to-some-great-get-out-fan-th-1820946824&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding his video about the theory in the January 2018 issue of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', Peele expressed interest in casting John Malkovich in a ''Get Out'' sequel, stating that it would be "cool" to "do the full trilogy".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' January 2018 Edition

The term ''bodega'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] can mean "pantry", "tavern", or "wine cellar". The derivative term '''''bodegón''''' is an augmentative that refers to a large ''bodega'', usually in a derogatory fashion. In [[Spanish art]], a ''bodegón'' is a [[still life]] painting depicting pantry items, such as victuals, game, and drink, often arranged on a simple stone slab, and also a painting with one or more figures, but with significant still life elements, typically set in a kitchen or tavern. It also refers to low-life or everyday objects, which can be painted with flowers, fruits, or other objects to display the painter's mastery.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, Paul. ''Art: A New History'', [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]], 2003, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Pompejanischer Maler um 70 001.jpg|thumb|left|Classic [[trompe-l'œil]] wall painting in [[Pompeii]] ([[Naples National Archaeological Museum]])]]
Starting in the [[Baroque]] period, such paintings became popular in [[Spain]] in the second quarter of the 17th century.  The tradition of still life painting appears to have started and was far more popular in the contemporary [[Low Countries]], today [[Belgium]] and [[Netherlands]] (then Flemish and Dutch artists), than it ever was in southern Europe. [[Dutch_Golden_Age_painting#Still_lifes|Northern still lifes]] had many subgenres; the ''breakfast piece'' was augmented by the ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'', the ''flower bouquet'', and the ''[[vanitas]]''. In Spain there were much fewer patrons for this sort of thing, but a type of ''breakfast piece'' did become popular, featuring a few objects of food and tableware laid on a table. Though now considered a Spanish invention, the classic [[trompe-l'œil]] presentation of fruit on a stone slab was common in ancient [[Rome]].

Still life painting in [[Baroque]] Spain was often austere; it differed from the [[Flemish Baroque painting#Still life and animal painting|Flemish Baroque]] still lifes, which often contain both rich banquets surrounded by ornate and luxurious items with fabric or glass. In bodegones, the game is often plain dead animals still waiting to be skinned. The fruits and vegetables are uncooked. The backgrounds are bleak or plain wood geometric blocks, often creating a surrealist air.  Both Netherlandish and Spanish still lifes often had a moral [[vanitas]] element.  Their austerity, akin to the bleakness of some of the Spanish plateaus, never copies  the sensual pleasures, plenitude, and luxury of many Northern European still life paintings.

The [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] paintings ''[[The Waterseller of Seville (Velázquez)|The Waterseller of Seville]]'', ''[[:Image:Diego Velázquez 017.jpg|Old woman frying eggs]]'', and ''[[The Lunch (Velázquez)|The lunch]]'' are often described as  ''bodegones''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/624772/Diego-Velazquez/61327/Sevilla-Seville#ref=ref369061 Encyclopædia Britannica article on Velasquez does so.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As does this dictionary of art terms: {{cite book|author=Lucie-Smith, Edward|title=The Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Art Terms|year=1984|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|page=32}} [[template:LCCN|LCCN]] 83-51331&lt;/ref&gt; due to the artist's depiction of jars and foodstuff. Some people reject this use of the term, calling them instead a mixture of [[genre painting]] in [[Bamboccianti]] style and [[still life]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The '''Broel Towers''' ({{lang-nl|Broeltorens}}) are a classified monument and a [[landmark]] in the Belgian city of [[Kortrijk]]. The towers are known as one of the most important symbols of the city.

== History ==
Although they look identical, the towers were not built at the same time. The Southern tower, also known as the ''Speyetoren'', was built in 1385 to control the traffic on the [[river Lys]]. This tower was part of the fortified fence of the first [[medieval]] castle of the [[Counts of Flanders]]. The Speyentoren was also part of the 12th century rampart, destroyed by Louis XIV in the 17th century. &lt;br&gt;
The Northern tower, known as the ''Ingelborchtoren'' was built in 1415 and was used as an [[Armory (military)|armory]].

Nowadays, the towers are, together with the Artillerytower (''in Dutch: Artillerietoren''), the last remaining parts of the [[medieval]] [[city wall]] around the city. Most of the fortifications in Kortrijk were ordered to be destroyed by [[Vauban]] in 1683, a period in which the French and the Spanish armies repeatedly fought over control of the region. The remaining parts were destroyed in the 18th century and during the world wars.

A statue of [[John of Nepomuk]] can be found in the middle of the bridge spanning between the two towers. This statue of the patron saint of the drowned has, ironically, fallen into the river Lys on several occasions due to warfare in the city. The bridge between the two towers was destroyed in both world wars.

'''Bud Plant''' was a [[wholesale]] [[comics]] [[Distribution (business)|distributor]] active in the 1970s and 1980s during the growth of the [[direct market]]. He also published a selection of comics and zines during the same period. Starting in 1970 as a [[mail-order]] distributor specializing in [[underground comix]], Plant absorbed some of his smaller rivals in the 1980s, and then sold his business to [[Diamond Comics Distributors]] in 1988.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
[[File:Bud Plant (1119227036).jpg|thumb|Bud Plant at the 1982 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].]]
[[File:Bud Plant booth (1117409592).jpg|thumb|Bud Plant's booth at the 1982 San Diego Comic-Con.]]
Plant (born 1952)&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.lib.msu.edu/rri/prri/plank.htm "Plank" to "Plantu"], Michigan State University Libraries, Special Collections Division, Reading Room Index to the Comic Art Collection.&lt;/ref&gt; was a comics and  illustrated books enthusiast&lt;ref&gt;Plant is listed as a member of the Merry Marvel Marching Society in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #40, published July 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[San Jose, California]], who throughout his high school years bought and sold back issue comic books through ads in fanzines such as ''[[Rocket's Blast Comicollector|Rocket's Blast''/''ComicCollector]]''.  In 1968 he co-founded '''Seven Sons Comic Shop''' with five friends, John Barrett, Jim Buser, Mike Nolan, Frank Scadina, and Tom Tallmon, in San Jose. Selling Seven Sons within a year, Plant and three partners then opened another San Jose-based comics shop called '''Comic World'''.&lt;ref name=Toucan&gt;[http://www.comic-con.org/toucan/bud-plant-comics-retailing-pioneer "THE TOUCAN INTERVIEW: Bud Plant: Comics Retailing Pioneer,"] ''Toucan'': The Official Comic-Con &amp; Wondercon Blog (June 28, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 Plant founded '''Bud Plant, Inc.''' as a mail order company specializing in [[underground comix]]. (His Holly Drive address appears as the publishing address of the first issue of ''Promethean Enterprises'' in 1969.) In 1971, Plant and five friends spent the summer dealing comics at conventions in Houston, [[Comic Art Convention|New York]], Dallas, [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego]], Miami, Boston, and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;Jacobson, Aileen. "Serious Comics Fans", ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (Aug 16, 1971), p. B2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant had met direct market pioneer [[Phil Seuling]] on the convention circuit;&lt;ref name=WashPost /&gt; in late 1973 Seuling called Plant to inform him that he had just cut a deal to ship [[Archie Comics|Archie]], [[DC Comics|DC]], [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], and [[Warren Publishing|Warren]] comic books from a new distribution center in [[Sparta, Illinois]]. Seuling offered the West Coast region to Plant, but Plant turned him down, preferring then to concentrate on the proliferating underground comix market.&lt;ref name="Beerbohm" /&gt;

=== Publishing ===
Plant entered the publishing field in 1969 as one of the three publishers, along with Al Davoren and Jim Vadeboncoeur, Jr., of ''[[Promethean Enterprises]]'' — a [[fanzine]] that attempted to straddle the comic/comix boundary. (''Promethean Enterprises'' lasted from 1969–1974.) In 1972, Plant took over the publishing responsibilities of the fanzine ''[[Jan Strnad|Anomaly]]'' from [[Jan Strnad]] who had published three issues since 1969. Plant published issue #4 of ''Anomaly'', evolving it into an underground comic.

As part of his retailing enterprise Comics &amp; Comix ([[#Comics &amp; Comix|see below]]), in 1974 Plant co-published one issue of the underground/[[sword and sorcery]] hybrid ''Barbarian Killer Funnies''; moving from there to the similarly themed ''[[The First Kingdom]]'', written and illustrated by [[Jack Katz (artist)|Jack Katz]]. (Under various publishing names, Plant published 24 issues of ''The First Kingdom'', from 1974 to 1986.) Comics &amp; Comix also published three issues of Jim Pinkoski's ''Spaced'' in 1974–1976; two issues of ''[[Dan O'Neill|Dan O'Neill's Comics and Stories]]'' in 1975; and two issues of [[Alfredo Alcala]]'s ''Magic Carpet'' in 1977–1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/publisher/2900/ Comics &amp; Comix entry], Grand Comics Database. Accessed Oct. 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1978, Plant was approached by [[Wendy Pini|Wendy]] &amp; [[Richard Pini]] about publishing ''[[Elfquest]]'', but he turned the couple down, as he was getting out the comics publishing business.&lt;ref name=Toucan /&gt; (The Pinis went on to much success as self-publishers.)

From 1980 to 1985, Comics &amp; Comix also published the industry trade journal ''[[Telegraph Wire]]''.

=== Comics &amp; Comix ===
{{main article|Comics and Comix}}
In August 1972, while still an undergraduate at [[San Jose State University]],&lt;ref name=Memories2&gt;Beerbohm, Robert. [http://www.comicconmemories.com/2010/01/06/comics-dealer-extraordinaire-robert-beerbohm-in-his-own-words/ "Comics Dealer Extraordinaire Robert Beerbohm: In His Own Words"], Comic-Convention Memories (Jan. 6, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Plant co-founded what became the comics retailer [[Comics &amp; Comix]] in [[Berkeley, California]], with  [[John Barrett (comics)|John Barrett]]&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, Michelle. "Newswatch: Pioneering Comics Retailer John Barrett Dies at 50", ''The Comics Journal'' #233 (May 2001), p. 18: Barrett died March 14, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and Plant's housemate [[Robert Beerbohm]].&lt;ref name="Beerbohm"&gt;Beerbohm, Bob. [http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/please_consider_buying_some_comics_from_robert_beerbohm/ "Please Consider Buying Some Comics From Industry Icon Robert Beerbohm"], The Comics Reporter (March 14, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 Comics &amp; Comix helped host the first Bay Area [[comics convention]], '''Berkeleycon 73''', in the Pauley Ballroom in the ASUC Building on the [[University of California, Berkeley]] campus. At that show, Comics &amp; Comix acquired over 4,000 [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] comic books owned by Tom Reilly.&lt;ref name="Beerbohm" /&gt; The phenomenal sales of the Reilly collection enabled Comics &amp; Comix to open more retail locations, first in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] (May 1973), on Columbus Avenue (down from the [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] area on the way to [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]]), and later in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], making it the first comic book chain store in America.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Expansion ===
In the early 1980s Plant supplied product to [[Destiny Distributors]], a sub-distributor based in Seattle and Vancouver, started by [[Phil Pankow]] (which was acquired by Diamond in 1990).&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Independent Meets Its Destiny", ''The Comics Journal'' #139 (December 1990), pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, Plant bought out regional rival [[Charles Abar Distribution]], based in [[Belmont, California]].&lt;ref name="DuinPlant"&gt;Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (eds.) "Bud Plant" in ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-344-8}}, p. 356–357.&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 1985 brought two important developments in the distribution industry, the bankruptcy of Seuling's [[Sea Gate Distributors]] (Seuling himself had died in 1984),&lt;ref&gt;"Phil Seuling, father of the direct-sales Market, dies at age of 50", ''The Comics Journal'' #93 (September 1984), pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; and the failure of Plant's West Coast rival [[Pacific Comics]] (which by that point was also a large independent comics publisher).&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Pacific Comics liquidated", ''The Comics Journal'' #95 (February 1985), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Plant and Midwestern distributor [[Capital City Distributors]] opened "an expanded facility in Seagate's old space in Sparta, Illinois, alongside [Pacific's old] printing plant".&lt;ref name="Sanford"&gt;Sanford, Jay Allen. [http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2004/aug/19/two-men-and-their-comic-books/ "Two Men and their Comic Books]", ''[[San Diego Reader]]'' blog (Aug. 19, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Plant acquired [[Alternate Realities Distributing, Inc.]], based in [[Denver, Colorado]], a wholesale distribution operation run by [[Chuck Rozanski|Nanette Rozanski]].&lt;ref&gt;Rozanski, Chuck. [http://www.milehighcomics.com/tales/cbg111.html "Returning to the Topic of My 1979 Visit to the Marvel Offices"], Tales From the Database, MileHighComics.com (March 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1988, Plant dominated distribution of comics in the West Coast, finally fulfilling Seuling's 1974 vision.

=== Sale to Diamond ===
In the summer of 1988, [[Steve Geppi]] of [[Diamond Comics Distribution]] bought Plant's distribution warehouses,&lt;ref&gt;"Bud Plant Sells Out to Diamond", ''The Comics Journal'' #124 (Aug. 1988), pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing Diamond to go "national",&lt;ref name="Success"&gt;Warshaw, Michael. "From Mailman to Tycoon", ''Success'' (June, 1994), pp. 28–32.&lt;/ref&gt; "thereby assuming control of "40 percent of the [[direct market|direct-sales market]]".&lt;ref name="DuinPlant"/&gt;

Later in 1988, Plant also sold Comics &amp; Comix.&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: "Comics &amp; Comix Sold", ''The Comics Journal'' #125 (October 1988), pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Back to basics ===
Since divesting himself of his distribution and brick-and-mortar retail businesses, Plant has maintained a mail-order (and now Internet) presence in art books, trade paperbacks, and rare books.&lt;ref name="DuinPlant" /&gt; Plant is known for the colorful titles of his sales catalogs:

* ''Bud Plant's Incredible Catalog'' (1987–1994)
* ''Bud Plant Illustrated Books'' (1987–2005) — out-of-print/rare book catalog
* ''Bud Plant's Comic Art Update'' (1993–2002)
* ''Bud Plant Comic Art Wholesale Catalog'' (Winter 1996)
* ''Bud Plant's Incorrigible Catalog'' — pinup art, erotic comic books, etc. (Winter 2001–2002)
* ''Bud Plant's Incredible Update'' (2003–present) — continuation of ''Comic Art Update''

=== Realignment ===
On July 5, 2011, Plant announced plans to sell his mail-order business and retire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://budplant.blogspot.com/2011/07/for-immediate-release-bud-plant-to.html |title=Bud Plant to Retire-- Offers Catalog &amp; Internet Business of 41 Years for Sale |author=Bud Plant |authorlink= |date=July 5, 2011 |website=blog of BudsArtBooks.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812223925/http://budplant.blogspot.com/2011/07/for-immediate-release-bud-plant-to.html |archive-date=August 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=October 28, 2011 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in April 2012 (after failing to find a buyer) he announced plans to downsize (eliminating print catalogs) but continue operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://budplant.blogspot.com/2012/04/were-back-big-news.html#comment-form We're Back! Big News].&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''capsule review''' is a form of criticism, usually associated with journalism, that offers a relatively short critique of a specified artistic work ([[movie]], [[music album]], [[restaurant]], [[painting]], etc.).  Capsule reviews generally appear in publications like newspapers and magazines, and can range anywhere from just a few sentences up to around 300 words.

''[[Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide]]'' is a famous publication that includes hundreds of capsule movie reviews by prolific film writer Leonard Maltin, including the world's shortest capsule review according to the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'', a 2 out of 4 star review of the 1948 musical ''[[Isn't It Romantic? (1948 film)|Isn't It Romantic?]]'' that consisted of only the word "no".

In [[Slavic Mythology]], '''Chernava''' ({{lang-rus|Чернава}}) is Morskoy Tsar's (Sea Tsar) daughter, spirit and personification of the river of the same name. She is a [[Mermaid|mermaid]]. Her head and upper body are human, while the lower body is a fish's tail. Chernava is famous by the epic of Sadko, where she appears.{{sfn|Fedorovich|1873|p=400}}{{sfn|Dixon-Kennedy|1998|p=52}}{{sfn|Bailey|2015|p=}}.

==In ''Sadko''==
In the Sadko ''[[Bylina|bylina]]'', Chernava appears as the one of the 900 mermaids. She is described as small, scrawny and young girl. When Morskoy Tsar offered Sadko a new bride,  Sadko took Chernava and lay down beside her. On their wedding night he did not touch her. When Sadko was asleep, Chernava had transformed into a river, helping him to get into the human world. Sadko woke up on the shore of the river Chernava and rejoined his first wife.

==In popular culture==
[[List of geological features on Venus|Chernava Colles]] are named after her.

[[Image:EddertonclassIII.jpg|thumb|A 19th century illustration of the stone by Charles Carter Petley (1857).]]
'''Edderton Cross Slab''' is a Class III [[Pictish stone]] standing in the old [[graveyard]] of the village of [[Edderton]], [[Easter Ross]].  The stone is of red [[sandstone]].  On the western side there is an undecorated but elegant [[celtic cross]], the circles within its rings emphasised by being left in relief.  On the eastern side there is another cross on the upper half, standing on a semi-circular base or arch, within which is a horseman in relief, with two further riders incised below.  The slab was formerly sunk considerably deeper in the earth, concealing the lower two horsemen, but has recently been raised to its presumed original height (notice the lack of lichen on the lower half in the accompanying photograph).

This monument should not be confused with the Edderton Symbol Stone, or [[Clach Biorach]] ("pointed stone"), a red sandstone pillar of [[Bronze Age]] origin with Pictish symbols incised on it, which stands in a field near the village of Edderton a little to the west.

Further fragments of early medieval cross-slabs, in poor condition, from Edderton churchyard, are preserved in [[Tain]] Museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11186">The '''Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art''' is located on the fourth floor of the [[Brooklyn Museum]], [[New York City]], United States. 

==History==
The Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art opened on March 23, 2007 at the Brooklyn Museum as the first public space of its kind in the country; it is a nexus for feminist art, theory, and activism. The {{convert|8300|sqft|m2|adj=on}} center, located on the museum's fourth floor, aims to create a compelling and interactive environment to raise awareness and educate future generations about [[feminism]]’s impact on culture.

Since 2007 the Center has been the permanent home of [[Judy Chicago]]'s landmark feminist work ''[[The Dinner Party]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/arts/19iht-raafemina-28463.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | first=Dana | last=Micucci | title=Feminist art gets place of pride in Brooklyn | date=2007-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kort|first=Michele|title=Home at Last|url=http://www.msmagazine.com/winter2007/homeatlast.asp|accessdate=23 May 2012|newspaper=[[Ms. Magazine]]|date=Winter 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center's Forum is a venue for public programs and a platform of advocacy for women’s issues, and its Feminist Art and Herstory galleries present critically acclaimed [http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/exhibitions/index.php exhibitions]. The Council for Feminist Art, a membership group, supports the ongoing educational programming and the continuing success of the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art. The Center's namesake and founder, [[Elizabeth Sackler|Elizabeth A. Sackler]], is a [[philanthropist]] and [[art collector]].

==Layout==
''The Dinner Party''{{’}}s gallery is the centerpiece of a dramatic design for the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art that was conceived and developed by award-winning architect [http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/about/susan_rodriguez.php Susan T. Rodriguez], FAIA, a partner in [[Ennead Architects]]. ''The Dinner Party'', which includes 39 placesettings as well as the names of 999 women on a ''[[List of women in the Heritage Floor|Heritage Floor]]'', is enclosed in large, canting glass walls that provide a first glimpse of Chicago’s work. It is surrounded by a series of distinct, yet interconnected series of galleries that include two changing exhibition galleries and a study center that can be transformed from an academic forum into a multimedia gallery, as required, by a large pivoting wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gallery Design|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/about/gallery_design.php|website=Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: About the Center|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist Art Base==
An original initiative from the Center for Feminist Art is its “Feminist Art Base.”&lt;ref name="fab" /&gt; This database is a self-generated selection of past and present artists, whose work reflect feminist ideas, investments, and concerns, such as [[Karen Heagle]], [[Julia Kunin]] and Clarity Haynes.  The database is actively added to with artists from the around the world, who continue to build their profiles. Each profile includes short biographies, CVs, and exemplary works as well as a “Feminist Art Statement.” This personal and living database wishes to be a comprehensive resource for achieving the Center’s mission: “''to present feminism in an approachable and relevant manner, to educate new generations about the meaning of feminist art, and to raise awareness of feminism's cultural contributions.''”&lt;ref name="fab"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_art_base/index.php | title=Feminist Art Base| publisher=Brooklyn Museum| accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Awards==
In March 2012 The Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art celebrated its fifth anniversary by honoring fifteen contemporary women with the Sackler Center First Awards. The awards, conceived by Elizabeth Sackler, are given each year to women who have broken a gender barrier to make a remarkable achievement and contribution in her respective field.

[[image:Environment-Triptych-2008-terracotta-portraits-sculptor-Jon-Edgar.jpg|thumb|right|''Environment Triptych'']]
The '''''Environment Triptych''''', by sculptor [[Jon Edgar]], is a group of three portrait heads of environmental thinkers of the day. First assembled in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;http://jonedgar.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/2008-environment-triptych-mabey-midgley-lovelock.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; it is composed of the terracotta heads of [[James Lovelock]], proposer of the [[Gaia hypothesis]], moral philosopher [[Mary Midgley]], and writer [[Richard Mabey]]. Edgar worked with three in either [[Cornwall]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] or [[Norfolk]] during visits in 2006 and 2007.

The heads have a relevance as individual portraits, but the interplay of the three heads plinthed together seemed to add something; perhaps emphasising the sitters’ diverse efforts in influencing human behaviour and our interaction with the planet and its other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;http://jonedgar.wordpress.com/2011/05/17/the-environment-series-heads/&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Triptych'' has led to the ''[[Environment Series]]'' of heads of environmentally aware sitters,&lt;ref&gt;article on the Human Clay exhibition, Surrey Advertiser. 2 Dec 2011 p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surrey.ac.uk/arts/visualarts/exhibitions%20and%20events/the_human_clay_jon_edgar.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surrey.ac.uk/arts/visualarts/exhibitions%20and%20events/The%20Human%20Clay%20Exhibition.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Chris Rapley]], [[Gordon Murray]], [[Tim Smit]], and [[Guy Watson]].

[[Image:CIExy1931 srgb gamut.png|240px|right|thumb|'''Typical CRT gamut'''&lt;br&gt;The grayed-out horseshoe shape is the entire range of possible [[chromaticity|chromaticities]], displayed in the [[CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram]] format (see below). The colored triangle is the gamut available to the [[sRGB]] color space typically used in computer monitors; it does not cover the entire space. The corners of the triangle are the [[primary color]]s for this gamut; in the case of a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]], they depend on the colors of the phosphors of the monitor. At each point, the brightest possible RGB color of that chromaticity is shown, resulting in the bright [[Mach band]] stripes corresponding to the edges of the RGB color cube.]]
In color reproduction, including [[computer graphics]] and [[photography]], the '''gamut''', or '''color gamut''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|æ|m|ə|t}}, is a certain ''complete subset'' of [[color]]s. The most common usage refers to the subset of colors which can be accurately represented in a given circumstance, such as within a given [[color space]] or by a certain [[output device]].

Another sense, less frequently used but still correct, refers to the complete set of colors found within an image at a given time. In this context, digitizing a photograph, converting a digitized image to a different color space, or outputting it to a given medium using a certain output device generally alters its gamut, in the sense that some of the colors in the original are lost in the process.

The term ''gamut'' was adopted from the field of music, where it means the set of pitches of which musical melodies are composed; [[Shakespeare]]'s use of the term in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' is sometimes attributed to the author/musician [[Thomas Morley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Long |first1=John H. |title=Shakespeare and Thomas Morley |journal=Modern Language Notes |date=1950 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=17–22 |doi=10.2307/2909321 |jstor=2909321}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s, the term was applied to a range of colors or hue, for example by [[Thomas De Quincey]], who wrote "[[Porphyry (geology)|Porphyry]], I have heard, runs through as large a gamut of hues as marble."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = De Quincey's works | author = Thomas De Quincey | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5TACAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=gamut-of-hues+date:0-1856#PPA35,M1 | publisher = James R. Osgood | year = 1854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[color theory]], the gamut of a device or process is that portion of the [[color space]] that can be represented, or reproduced.  Generally, the color gamut is specified in the [[hue]]–[[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]] plane, as a system can usually produce colors over a wide [[intensity (disambiguation)|intensity]] range within its color gamut; for a [[subtractive color]] system (such as used in [[printing]]), the range of intensity available in the system is for the most part meaningless without considering system-specific properties (such as the [[Optics|illumination]] of the ink).

When certain colors cannot be expressed within a particular color model, those colors are said to be ''out of gamut''. For example, while pure [[red]] can be expressed in the [[RGB]] color space, it cannot be expressed in the [[CMYK]] color space; pure red is out of gamut in the [[CMYK]] color space.

A device that can reproduce the entire visible color space is an unrealized goal within the [[engineering]] of [[Display device|color displays]] and printing processes. Modern techniques allow increasingly good approximations, but the complexity of these systems often makes them impractical.

While processing a digital image, the most convenient color model used is the RGB model. Printing the image requires transforming the image from the original RGB color space to the printer's CMYK color space. During this process, the colors from the RGB which are out of gamut must be somehow converted to approximate values within the CMYK space gamut. Simply trimming only the colors which are out of gamut to the closest colors in the destination space would [[burned (image)|burn]] the image. There are several algorithms approximating this transformation, but none of them can be truly perfect, since those colors are simply out of the target device's capabilities. This is why identifying the colors in an image which are out of gamut in the target color space as soon as possible during processing is critical for the quality of the final product.

==Representation of gamuts==

Gamuts are commonly represented as areas in the [[CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram]] as shown at right, with the curved edge representing the [[monochromatic]] (single-wavelength) or [[spectral color]]s.

The accessible gamut depends on the brightness; a full gamut must therefore be represented in 3D space, as below:

The pictures at left show the gamuts of RGB color space (top), such as on computer monitors, and of reflective colors in nature (bottom). The cone drawn in grey corresponds roughly to the CIE diagram at right, with the added dimension of brightness.

The axes in these diagrams are the responses of the short-wavelength (''S''), middle-wavelength (''M''), and long-wavelength (''L'') cones in the [[human eye]]. The other letters indicate black (''Blk''), red (''R''), green (''G''), blue (''B''), cyan (''C''), magenta (''M''), yellow (''Y''), and white colors (''W''). (Note: These pictures are not exactly to scale.)

The top left diagram shows that the shape of the RGB gamut is a triangle between red, green, and blue at lower luminosities; a triangle between cyan, magenta, and yellow at higher luminosities, and a single white point at maximum luminosity. The exact positions of the apexes depends on the emission spectra of the [[phosphor]]s in the computer monitor, and on the ratio between the maximum luminosities of the three phosphors (i.e., the color balance).

The gamut of the CMYK color space is, ideally, approximately the same as that for RGB, with slightly different apexes, depending on both the exact properties of the dyes and the light source. In practice, due to the way raster-printed colors interact with each other and the paper and due to their non-ideal absorption spectra, the gamut is smaller and has rounded corners.

The gamut of reflective colors in nature has a similar, though more rounded, shape. An object that reflects only a narrow band of wavelengths will have a color close to the edge of the CIE diagram, but it will have a very low luminosity at the same time. At higher luminosities, the accessible area in the CIE diagram becomes smaller and smaller, up to a single point of white, where all wavelengths are reflected exactly 100 per cent; the exact coordinates of white are determined by the color of the light source.

==Limitations of color representation==
===Surfaces===
[[Image:Rechteckspektrum sRGB.svg|right|thumb|300px|Spectrum of a color-optimal reflective material.]]
[[Image:Optimal-color-solid,FL4,XYZ.gif|right|frame|MacAdam limits for illuminant [[Standard illuminant#Illuminant series F|CIE FL4]] in CIE xyY.]]

In the beginning of the 20th century, industrial demands for a controllable way to describe colors and the new possibility to measure light spectra initiated intense research on mathematical descriptions of colors.

The idea of optimal colors was introduced by the Baltic German chemist [[Wilhelm Ostwald]]. [[Erwin Schrödinger]] showed in his 1919 article ''{{lang|de|Theorie der Pigmente von größter Leuchtkraft}}'' (Theory of Pigments with Highest Luminosity)&lt;ref name=sch&gt;{{cite journal | last = Schrödinger | first = Erwin | title = Theorie der Pigmente größter Leuchtkraft | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 367  | issue = 15 | pages = 603–622 | year = 1919 | doi = 10.1002/andp.19203671504|bibcode = 1920AnP...367..603S }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the most-saturated colors that can be created with a given total reflectivity are generated by surfaces having either zero or full reflectance at any given wavelength, and the reflectivity spectrum must have at most two transitions between zero and full. Thus two types of "optimal color" spectra are possible: Either the transition goes from zero at both ends of the spectrum to one in the middle, as shown in the image at right, or it goes from one at the ends to zero in the middle. The first type produces colors that are similar to the spectral colors and follow roughly the horseshoe-shaped portion of the [[Chromaticity diagram#The CIE xy chromaticity diagram|CIE xy chromaticity diagram]], but are generally less saturated. The second type produces colors that are similar to (but generally less saturated than) the colors on the straight line in the [[Chromaticity diagram#The CIE xy chromaticity diagram|CIE xy chromaticity diagram]], leading to magenta-like colors. Schrödinger's work was further developed by [[David MacAdam]] and [[Siegfried Rösch]].&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CzAbJrLin_AC&amp;pg=PA469&amp;dq=Introduction+to+Color+Imaging+Science+%22optimal+color%22 |title=Introduction to Color Imaging Science|first=Hsien-Che|last=Lee|page=468|chapter=18.7: Theoretical color gamut|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0-521-84388-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacAdam was the first person to calculate precise coordinates of selected points on the boundary of the optimal color solid in the CIE 1931 color space for lightness levels from Y = 10 to 95 in steps of 10 units. This enabled him to draw the optimal color solid at an acceptable degree of precision. Because of his achievement, the boundary of the optimal color solid is called the ''MacAdam limit''. On modern computers, it is possible to calculate an optimal color solid with great precision in seconds or minutes. The MacAdam limit, on which the most saturated (or "optimal") colors reside, shows that colors that are near monochromatic colors can only be achieved at very low luminance levels, except for yellows, because a mixture of the wavelengths from the long straight-line portion of the spectral locus between green and red will combine to make a color very close to a monochromatic yellow.

===Light sources===
Light sources used as primaries in an additive color reproduction system need to be bright, so they are generally not close to monochromatic.  That is, the color gamut of most variable-color light sources can be understood as a result of difficulties producing pure [[monochromatic]] (single [[wavelength]]) light.  The best technological source of monochromatic light is the [[laser]], which can be rather expensive and impractical for many systems. However, as [[optoelectronic]] technology matures, single-longitudinal-mode diode lasers are becoming less expensive, and many applications can already profit from this; such as Raman spectroscopy, holography, biomedical research, fluorescence, reprographics, interferometry, semiconductor inspection, remote detection, optical data storage, image recording, spectral analysis, printing, point-to-point free-space communications, and fiber optic communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalaser.com/laser/single-frequency-laser.html |title=Single Frequency Laser - Single Longitudinal Mode Laser |deadurl=no |accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jdsu.com/en-us/Lasers/Products/A-Z-Product-List/Pages/diode-laser-810-or-830-or-852nm-50-200mw-single-mode-54xx-series.aspx |title=JDSU - Diode Laser, 810 or 830 or 852 nm, 50-200 mW, Single-Mode (54xx Series) |deadurl=no |accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laserglow.com/S53 |title=Laserglow Technologies - Handheld Lasers, Alignment Lasers and Lab / OEM Lasers |deadurl=no |accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiberoptics4sale.com/wordpress/laser-diode-characteristics/ |title=Laser Diode Characteristics |deadurl=no |accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems that use additive color processes usually have a color gamut which is roughly a [[convex polygon]] in the hue-saturation plane. The vertices of the polygon are the most saturated colors the system can produce. In subtractive color systems, the color gamut is more often an irregular region.

Following is a list of representative color systems more-or-less ordered from large to small color gamut:

* [[Laser video projector]] uses 3 lasers to produce the broadest gamut available in practical display equipment today, derived from the fact that lasers produce truly monochromatic primaries. The systems work either by scanning the entire picture a dot at a time and modulating the laser directly at high frequency, much like the electron beams in a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]], or by optically spreading and then modulating the laser and scanning a line at a time, the line itself being modulated in much the same way as in a [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] projector.  Lasers can also be used as a light source for a DLP projector.&lt;!-- ref to Mitsubishi DLPs --&gt;  More than 3 lasers can be combined to increase the gamut range, a technique sometimes used in [[holography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=ao-47-4-A123 | title = Color holography to produce highly realistic three-dimensional images}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Digital Light Processing]] or DLP technology is a trademarked technology from Texas Instruments. The DLP chip contains a rectangular array of up to 2 million hinge-mounted microscopic mirrors. Each of the micromirrors measures less than one-fifth the width of a human hair. A DLP chip's micromirror tilts either toward the light source in a DLP projection system (ON) or away from it (OFF). This creates a light or dark pixel on the projection surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dlp.com/technology/how-dlp-works/default.aspx | title = DLP Technology | accessdate = 2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current DLP projectors use a quickly rotating wheel with transparent colored "pie slices" to present each color frame successively. One rotation shows the complete image.
* [[Photographic film]] can reproduce a larger color gamut than typical television, computer, or [[home video]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamutvision.com/docs/camera_scanner.html | title = Film gamut, apples, and oranges | accessdate = 2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] and similar video displays have a roughly triangular color gamut which covers a significant portion of the visible color space.  In CRTs, the limitations are due to the phosphors in the screen which produce red, green, and blue light.
* [[Liquid crystal display]] (LCD) screens filter the light emitted by a [[backlight]]. The gamut of an LCD screen is therefore limited to the emitted spectrum of the backlight. Typical LCD screens use cold-cathode fluorescent bulbs ([[CCFL]]s) for backlights. LCD Screens with certain [[light-emitting diode|LED]] or wide-gamut CCFL backlights yield a more comprehensive gamut than CRTs. However, some LCD technologies vary the color presented by viewing angle. [[In Plane Switching]] or [[Patterned vertical alignment]] screens have a wider span of colors than [[Twisted nematic field effect|Twisted Nematic]].
* [[Television]] normally uses a CRT, LCD or [[Plasma display|plasma]] display, but does not take full advantage of its color display properties, due to the limitations of [[broadcasting]].  [[High-definition television|HDTV]] is less restrictive{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}, but still somewhat less than, for example, computer displays using the same display technology.
* [[Paint]] mixing, both artistic and for commercial applications, achieves a reasonably large color gamut by starting with a larger palette than the red, green, and blue of CRTs or cyan, magenta, and yellow of printing.  Paint may reproduce some highly saturated colors that cannot be reproduced well by CRTs (particularly violet), but overall the color gamut is smaller.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}
* [[Printing]] typically uses the [[CMYK]] color space (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black). Very few printing processes do not include black; however, those processes (with the exception of [[dye-sublimation printer]]s) are poor at representing low saturation, low intensity colors. Efforts have been made to expand the gamut of the printing process by adding inks of non-primary colors; these are typically orange and green (see [[Hexachrome]]) or light cyan and light magenta (see [[CcMmYK color model]]). [[Spot color]] inks of a very specific color are also sometimes used.
* A [[monochrome]] display's color gamut is a one-dimensional curve in color space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQffvaCaZlgC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=A+monochrome+display+color+gamut+is+a+one-dimensional+curve+in+color+space.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvoKnhxIzVAhUX9mMKHQ92D1cQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20monochrome%20display%20color%20gamut%20is%20a%20one-dimensional%20curve%20in%20color%20space.&amp;f=false|title=Image Processing for Computer Graphics and Vision|last=Velho|first=Luiz|last2=Frery|first2=Alejandro C.|last3=Gomes|first3=Jonas|date=2009-04-29|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781848001930|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wide color gamut==
The [[Ultra HD Forum]] defines wide color gamut (WCG) as a color gamut that is wider than [[Rec. 709]].&lt;ref name=PhaseAGudelinesJuly2016UltraHDForum&gt;{{cite news |title=Ultra HD Forum: Phase A Guidelines |publisher=Ultra HD Forum |url=http://ultrahdforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ultra-HD-Forum-Deployment-Guidelines-V1.1-Summer-2016.pdf |format=PDF |date=2016-07-15 |accessdate=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; WCG would include [[DCI-P3]] and [[Rec. 2020]].&lt;ref name=PhaseAGudelinesJuly2016UltraHDForum/&gt;

'''Handoga''' is located 14 km to the west of [[Dikhil]], [[Djibouti]]. During the first excavations in 1970, archaeologists discovered foundations of stone houses and the walls of a stone edifice with a recess that faces [[Mecca]]. 

==History==
They have also updated shards of ceramics, chipped stone tools and a glass bead. The engravings oldest discovered to date are from the fourth or third millennium BC In the pre-Islamic period, the most famous is the site of Handoga there where the ruins of a village squares subcircular dry stone delivered different objects. An old settlement, Handoga is the site of numerous ancient ruins and buildings, many of obscure origins. Including ceramic shards matching vases used brazier, or containers that can hold water, several choppers and [[microlith]]s, blades, drills, trenchers basalt, rhyolite or obsidian. A team of archaeologists discover an [[elephant]] date of 1.6 million years near the area. Also a pearl orange coralline, three glass paste, etc.. No trace of metal object.

'''Henry Pearlman''' (1895–1974) was a Brooklyn-born, self-made businessman who discovered in midlife a passion for [[impressionist]] and [[post-impressionist]] art. Over three postwar decades, he assembled a "deeply personal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Willis F.|title=Cézanne and His Contemporaries: The Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman Collection|date=1967|location=Detroit|page=np}}&lt;/ref&gt;  collection centered on thirty-three works by [[Paul Cézanne]] and more than forty by [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Chaïm Soutine]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] and a dozen other European modernists. His eye for quality was "rarely matched in a private collection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anonymous|title=The Pearlman Collection|journal=Arts|date=February 1959|volume=33|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and business career==
Pearlman started his career in the cork insulation business, forming his own company, Eastern Cold Storage Insulation Corporation, at the age of twenty-four and becoming a major player in marine refrigeration. He married Rose Fried in 1925; they raised two daughters in [[Croton-on-Hudson]], eventually living both there and in Manhattan and traveling frequently in pursuit of art.

==Art Collector==

[[File:1921, Soutine, View of Céret.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chaïm Soutine]], ''View of Céret'', ca. 1921-22]]

While Pearlman initially decorated his Croton home with Old Master and American Realist paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeLue|first=Rachael Z.|title=Cézanne and the Modern: Masterpieces of European Art from the Pearlman Collection|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Art Museum and Yale University Press|location=Princeton and New Haven|isbn=978-0300174403|page=60|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300174403|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  including those found at local flea markets, his passion for art, and the stories behind each work, found full expression with the purchase at auction in 1945 of an expressionist painting by [[Chaïm Soutine]] – ''View of Céret'' (formerly ''Village Square, Céret''). As one observer put it, "his first foray into Parisian modernism revealed an acute eye, an instinct for the historical moment and a deeply felt connection to an artist who opened up a new world for him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wullschlager|first=Jackie|title=Cézanne and modern masterpieces from the Pearlman Collection|journal=Financial Times|date=14 March 2014|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/cd34c646-a877-11e3-b50f-00144feab7de.html#slide0|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pearlman quickly made connections in the New York art world; he spent time in museums and archives; and he soon traded his decorative collection for carefully selected examples of modern works by impressionist, post-impressionist and expressionist European artists. Pearlman found himself captivated by the details of the lives of and associations among these artists, and his acquisitions often followed such discoveries; he "liked connections and contexts, but as they arose within the framework of his vividly personal taste."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wullschlager|first=Jackie|title=Cézanne and modern masterpieces from the Pearlman Collection|journal=Financial Times|date=14 March 2014|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/cd34c646-a877-11e3-b50f-00144feab7de.html#slide0|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearlman was invigorated by the pursuit of quality as well as the challenges of finding, authenticating and negotiating the ownership of increasingly rare masterpieces.

In the years after World War II, Pearlman began traveling to Europe. During an early trip to London he met Austrian expressionist [[Oskar Kokoschka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Lue|first=Rachael Z.|title=Cézanne and the Modern: Masterpieces of European Art from the Pearlman Collection|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Art Museum and Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300174403|page=61|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300174403|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would result in a lifelong friendship for Pearlman with one of the few living artists whose work he collected. On this same trip he also visited the places where Soutine had painted, trying to identify the landscapes he already knew well from their expressionist representation – an activity he would repeat with other artists and works as he built his collection. In his hunt for new works, he looked first to Soutine’s close associates, including [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]]. Ultimately the collection would include seven paintings by Soutine, and four works by Modigliani, including a rare limestone head and two oil portraits (''[[Léon Indenbaum]]'' and ''[[Jean Cocteau]]'').

Although successful in business, Pearlman was never able to match the resources of his contemporaries. Instead, "he was both lucky and clever: lucky in that, when he first started, the art he was interested in…could be secured for thousands rather than millions of dollars…and clever in that he continuously honed his eye and then applied his skills… to obtain the objects of his passion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=B. B.|title=A rare feast|journal=The Economist|date=3 April 2014|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2014/04/masterpieces-19th-and-20th-century-european-art|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1950 Pearlman learned from a dealer that [[Van Gogh]]’s ''Tarascon Diligence'' was available from the heirs of the artist Milo Beretta. He quickly offered a combination of paintings and cash to make what is perhaps his most fabled acquisition – the last time a "lost" Van Gogh will reappear for the next sixty-five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Genauer|first=Emily|title=Art and Artists: A Van Gogh, New to America, Acquired by Private Collector,|journal=The New York Herald Tribune|date=3 September 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a reviewer described, this Van Gogh was "a typical Pearlman picture: assertive, pushing a characteristic manner to an extreme that is slightly unusual in the artist’s oeuvre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wullschlager|first=Jackie|title=Cézanne and modern masterpieces from the Pearlman Collection|journal=Financial Times|date=14 March 2014|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/cd34c646-a877-11e3-b50f-00144feab7de.html#slide0|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in 1950, with the advice of noted [[Cézanne]] specialist [[John Rewald]], Pearlman made his first purchase of a Cézanne watercolor, ''Cistern in the Park of Château Noir''. Over the following two decades, he would acquire more than thirty works by Cézanne and assemble the most distinguished collection of watercolors by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong, Carol and|first=Laura Giles, eds.|title=Cézanne in Focus: Watercolors from the Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection|date=2002|publisher=Princeton University Art Museum|location=Princeton|url=https://www.amazon.com/Cezanne-Focus-Watercolors-Pearlman-Collection/dp/B000JWDTRA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1397143393&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=%22cezanne+in+focus%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This new fascination with Cézanne did not distract Pearlman from his expanding interest in the works of other artists who lived and worked in France, many of whom knew, were influenced by and competed with one another. In addition to Modigliani, he added works by Toulouse-Lautrec, Manet, Degas, Renoir and Gauguin as well as several significant oil paintings by Cézanne, including the only known vertical-format&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rewald|first=John|title=The Paintings of Paul Cézanne: A Catalogue Raisonné|date=1996|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|pages=535–537}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the artist’s favorite subject, [[Mont Sainte-Victoire]].  Pearlman continued to build his collection - buying, selling and trading works – for the three remaining decades of his life. His last two purchases were Cézanne watercolors: a late masterpiece (''Still Life with Carafe, Bottle, and Fruit'') and ''Rocks at Bibémus'', which he had come to know when it appeared alongside works from his collection in a number of exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Lue|first=Rachael Z.|title=Cézanne and the Modern: Masterpieces of European Art from the Pearlman Collection|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Art Museum and Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300174403|page=68|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300174403|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions and Legacy==

[[File:1895, Cézanne, Cistern in the Park of Château Noir.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''Cistern in the Park of Château Noir'', 1895-1900]]

Beginning in the 1950s, Henry and Rose Pearlman began lending individual works to major museums, initially for retrospectives of Soutine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Monroe|title=Soutine|date=1950|publisher=Museum of Modern Art, New York in collaboration with the Cleveland Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Modigliani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soby|first=James Thrall|title=Modigliani: Paintings, Drawings, Sculpture.|date=1951|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As their collection took shape, loans and exhibitions of the collection became important to them and eventually occupied as much of Henry’s time and attention as acquisitions did. Although he never tired of the hunt, works that met his eye for quality and expressiveness were soon available only to those with the funds, not just a passion.

Pearlman’s generosity extended beyond the loans of works from his collection. He lent financial and other support to artists, including Kokoschka and [[Jacques Lipchitz]], whose studio was destroyed by fire in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacques Lipchitz studio fund invoice, 1952? (Digital ID: 14010), Jacques Lipchitz papers and Bruce Bassett papers concerning Jacques Lipchitz, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/jacques-lipchitz-studio-fund-invoice-14010|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Later he allowed his collection to be exhibited as a fundraiser for an organization helping immigrant populations settle in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M. Knoedler &amp; Co.|title=A Loan Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors and Sculpture from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman for the Benefit of Greenwich House|date=1959|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[http://www.pearlmancollection.org The Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation] was established in 1955 as a not-for-profit organization and is the current owner of the collection. The first exhibition of the collection took place in 1958: twenty-seven selected works, lent anonymously, to the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baltimore Museum of Art|title=Anonymous Collection Exhibition|date=July–September 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous exhibitions of the collection (in whole and in part) have taken place over the past six decades, including the following: forty-six works were shown at [[Knoedler &amp; Company]] in New York in 1959;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M. Knoedler &amp; Co.|title=A Loan Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors and Sculpture from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman for the Benefit of Greenwich House|date=1959|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Fogg Museum]] in 1959;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fogg Museum|title=Drawings, Watercolors and Oils by Paul Cézanne Lent by an Anonymous Collector|date=Exhibition, 1 July–1 September  1959|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the collection was featured in different exhibitions at the [[Brooklyn Museum of Art]] in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooklyn Museum of Art|title=An Exhibition of 19th &amp; 20th Century Painting and Sculpture from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman|date=Exhibition, 29 June–5 September  1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooklyn Museum of Art|title=The Henry Pearlman Collection|date=Exhibition, 22 May–15 October 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=1974|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1986;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooklyn Museum of Art|title=Art of Cézanne from the Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=Exhibition, 2 May–14 July 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Detroit Institute of Art]] in 1967;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cézanne and His Contemporaries: The Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman Collection|date=1967|publisher=Detroit Institute of Arts|location=Detroit}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] in 1970;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Impressionism, Post-impressionism, Expressionism: The Mr. &amp; Mrs. Henry Pearlman Collection of Works by Cézanne, Van Gogh, Degas, Toulouse Lautrec, Manet, Modigliani, Soutine, and Others|date=1970|publisher=Wadsworth Atheneum|location=Hartford, Conn.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Gallery of Art]] in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.|title=Cézanne Watercolors from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman|date=Exhibition, 14 April–30 September  1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco|title=Paul Cézanne: Works from the Pearlman Collection|date=Exhibition, 26 June–29 August 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1960 article in ''Connoisseur'' magazine describes Pearlman’s "unflagging fascination of the hunt … [He] trusts a stubborn faith in his own taste and has no interest in assembling an anthology of the standard names of modern art, but only those artists who have a special appeal to his individual taste."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chanin|first=A. L.|title=The Henry Pearlman Collection|journal=Connoisseur|date=June 1960|volume=145|issue=586|pages=230–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1961 Pearlman began making summer loans to museums, starting with the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]’s "Paintings from Private Collections: Summer Loan Exhibition" series, in part so that the works would be safe and seen while he and Rose were in Croton. (When not on loan, the collection was divided between their Park Avenue apartment and Henry’s office in midtown Manhattan.)

Henry Pearlman spent much of the last year of his life organizing an exhibition of the collection at the Brooklyn Museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=1974|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; which toured after his death to Princeton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Art Museum, Princeton University|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=Exhibition, 8 December 1974–14 March 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utica (NY),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Munson-Williams-Proctor Institute|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=Exhibition, 13 April–31August 1974|location=Utica, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williamstown (MA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Francine and Sterling Clark Institute|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=Exhibition, 26 September  1975–22 February 1976|location=Williamstown, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carnegie Institute|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=Exhibition, 6 April–30 May 1976|location=Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection returned to the [[Princeton University Art Museum]] in 1976, when Rose Pearlman, as head of the foundation, initiated a series of longer-term loans that continue to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shirey|first=David L.|title=Princeton Gets Pearlman Art for 2 Years|journal=New York Times|date=27 June 1976|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A world-class university-based museum, Princeton offers the collection security, conservation, curatorial expertise and management of loan requests from museums around the world.

In 2014, the Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation and the [http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/story/cézanne-and-modern-masterpieces-european-art-pearlman-foundation Princeton University Art Museum] initiated a tour of the collection, including its first exhibitions outside the United States. With the aim of expanding the audience for these works and artists, the tour (''Cézanne and the Modern: Masterpieces from the Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection'') opened at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in Oxford, England, in March 2014. Reviewers noted: "A collection of truly stunning art works" (''Oxford Times'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Theresa|title=A collection of truly stunning art works|journal=The Oxford Times|date=20 March 2014|url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/leisure/art/11090159.A_collection_of_truly_stunning_art_works/|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''Cézanne and the Modern''… makes you think about modern art – where it began, and what it is" (''The Guardian'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Jonathan|title=Cézanne and the Modern review – 'puts Ashmolean in the big league|journal=The Guardian|date=10 March 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/10/cezanne-modern-exhibition-review-ashmolean-museum-oxford|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The finest, best preserved collection of Cézanne watercolours in the world" (''Financial Times'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wullschlager|first=Jackie|title=Cézanne and modern masterpieces from the Pearlman Collection|journal=Financial Times|date=14 March 2014|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/cd34c646-a877-11e3-b50f-00144feab7de.html#slide0|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, 2014, it traveled to the [[Musée Granet]] in Aix-en-Provence, France, where many of the Cézanne works were originally created. The collection then returned to North America with three exhibitions: The [[High Museum]] in Atlanta, the [[Vancouver Art Gallery]] and at [[Princeton University Art Museum|Princeton]] for the fall semester of 2015.

In September, 2018, the Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation launched a redesigned [http://www.pearlmancollection.org website] for the collection. Featuring high-quality, shareable images of the entire collection, it also offers details about where the works were created. Some of these include photographs of the same view today and many include Google Map locations. The site also has excerpts from Henry Pearlman’s "Reminiscences of a Collector," with anecdotes about collecting, forgeries, negotiations, dealers and competing collectors. The paper archives of Pearlman’s correspondence and files, held at the Smithsonian Institution’s [http://www.aaa.si.edu Archives of American Art], are also linked as well as other external resources, such as the letters of Van Gogh, X-rays of hidden works and connections among the artists represented in the collection.

'''Hurley''' is an American [[multinational corporation]] that is engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, worldwide marketing and selling of [[surfing|surf]] apparel and accessories. The company's headquarters is in [[Costa Mesa, California]]. Since 2002, Hurley has been owned by [[Nike, Inc.]]

==History==
Hurley was founded in 1979 by 23-year-old Bob Hurley  (along with partner Bob Rowland and Business Manager Joe Knoernschild) as Hurley Surfboards//International Pro Designs (I.P.D.). Hurley worked for five years as a [[surf board]] shaper for various companies; including Lightning Bolt; Wind-an-Sea and Wave Tools. While becoming known as one of the premiere shapers in Southern California, Hurley licensed the U.S. rights to the up-and-coming Australian surf brand [[Billabong (clothing)|Billabong]], and formed Billabong USA in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Carroll |first=Corky |title=Hurley saw the big wave coming before any of us |url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/hurley-348253-bob-surf.html |accessdate=April 7, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Orange County Register]] |date=April 7, 2012|authorlink=Corky Carroll |pages=Local 1, 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founding partners in Billabong USA besides Hurley were Bob Rowland (General Partners), and as limited partners Chip Rowland, Mike Ochsner, Joe Knoernschild, Tom Fletcher and Bill Hurley.

In 1998, the U.S. licensing rights for Billabong were up for renewal after the company had grown to over $70M in sales in America. The USA management team decided to not renew the USA license for Billabong USA and in 1999 Hurley International was born. Founding working partners of Billabong USA Hurley, Knoernschild, Ochsner and Bill Hurley transitioned over to Hurley International. Billabong USA's designer Lian Murray also became a partner with the newly created Hurley International.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
 
On May 12, 2004
, the company was sold to [[Nike, Inc.]] for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nike Buys Hurley | publisher = EXPN.com | date = February 25, 2002 | url = http://expn.go.com/skt/s/nikehur.html | accessdate = 2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand maintains relative autonomy from its Nike parent{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} and has its corporate headquarters in [[Costa Mesa, California]], USA.
By the mid-1980s, Billabong USA was doing really well. Bob and his team were committed to thinking and doing things differently. The team took full responsibility for design, sourcing, marketing and financing.

On June 4, 2012, Nike announced that Bob Hurley would assume the interim CEO role at Hurley International, LLC. replacing Michael Egeck who has decided to leave the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = NIKE, Inc. Announces Leadership Change at Hurley | publisher = marketwatch.com | date = June 4, 2012 | url = http://www.marketwatch.com/story/nike-inc-announces-leadership-change-at-hurley-2012-06-04 | accessdate = 2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A major part of the company's success has been the endorsement of [[pop-punk]] bands such as [[Blink-182]] and [[All Time Low]]. Furthering their involvement in the music industry, Hurley sponsors the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Avenged Sevenfold]] and [[reggae]] band [[The Green (band)|The Green]].

'''''I'll Remember April''''' is a 1999 American [[family film|family]] [[drama film|drama]] film starring [[Pat Morita]], [[Pam Dawber]], [[Haley Joel Osment]], [[Mark Harmon]] and [[Yuki Tokuhiro]].  It was directed by [[Bob Clark]].

==Plot==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Four children capture a [[Japan]]ese soldier who washes ashore during the [[World War II|Second World War]].

Although the horrors of World War II are far removed from the Pacific Coast community where adolescent Duke Cooper (Trevor Morgan) and his three best chums play soldier, experiment with swearing, and earnestly patrol the beach for Japanese submarines, the realities of the war are about to come crashing down around them. Not when a Japanese soldier, stranded and wounded when his sub quickly dived, washes ashore; his capture by the foursome merely allows for more playtime and thoughts of becoming heroes. It's coming because Duke's older brother is on some island awaiting combat and the black sedans with military tags have already begun rolling through town to deliver their grim announcements. And Duke's Japanese American pal Willie Tanaka (Yuki Tokuhiro), all three feet and 55 pounds of him, has suddenly become a threat to national security, so he, his mother, and grandfather are soon to be shipped away to an internment camp.

'''IFAN''' ('''I.F.A.N.''', '''Institut fondamental d'Afrique noire''' or '''African Institute of Basic research''') is a cultural and scientific institute in the nations of the former [[French West Africa]].  Founded in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] in 1938 as the '''Institut français d’[[Sub-Saharan Africa|Afrique noire]]''' (the name was changed only in 1966), it was headquartered in what is now the building of the [[IFAN Museum of African Arts]].  Its charge was to study the language, history, and culture of the peoples ruled by [[French colonial empires|French colonialism]] in Africa.

==Early history==
IFAN first formed from a combination of three forces: the French colonial "[[Civilizing mission]]", the desire for more efficient [[Indirect rule]] through the understanding of African cultures, and research into the resources of the French dominion in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;See: David Robinson. Paths of accommodation: Muslim societies and French colonial authorities in Senegal and Mauritania, 1880-1920, Athens, Ohio University Press (2000) {{ISBN|0-8214-1353-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Governors General [[Ernest Roume]] (1902–1908) and [[William Ponty]] (1908–1914) oversaw a reorganization of the French higher educational system in the colonies, and placing [[Georges Hardy]] in charge, moved the colonial administration into a model which used elements from both a "Direct", [[Assimilation (French colonial)|Assimilationist]] policy and an [[Indirect rule|Indirect]], rule by African proxy policy.  The first required educational resources be created provided for the small minority of "''assimilated''" Africans, while the later required French colonial administrators be educated in the workings of African societies.  To these ends, Hardy oversaw the creation of the  [[École normale supérieure William Ponty]] (under the administration of [[Joseph Clozel]]), the publication ''Bulletin de l'Enseigement en AOF'', and the ''Comite d'etudes historiques et scientifiques de l'AOF'' (1918).  This last, immensely successful as a scientific journal, inaugurated  what one historian has called an era of "..knowledge and control." &lt;ref&gt;Robinson, ibid, (p.69 in French language edition, 2004, {{ISBN|2-84586-485-X}} )&lt;/ref&gt;

These imperial (or at best [[paternalist]]) scientific tools were turned on their head in a number of ways.  First, the African higher education system (and the École William Ponty in particular) became the incubator for the political leaders of the independence movement.  The study of African cultures, though invaluable to modern historians, did little to legitimize French rule through their [[Chefs du Canton]], but it did provide Francophone West Africans (such as [[Léopold Senghor]]) with the materials to bolster their sense of cultural importance, as demonstrated in the [[Negritude]] movement.  Finally, Europeans and Africans who opposed colonial rule came together in the years after the founding of IFAN in Dakar. IFAN was first conceived as an integration of various French colonial research systems in the early 1930s, and the vision was one of putting science to the service of the colonial project.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Galliard quotes a publication from the early 30s:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is for us a sort of intellectual duty and a requirement of colonial honour to study the countries that we must administer and the people that we must educate and protect. This is, in part, one of the strongest justifications for colonisation, and it cannot be defined in material and economic terms . . . . The establishment of African science is indeed an exigency of our colonial policy (IFAN, 1961: 37).&lt;/blockquote&gt; Jacques Gaillard. [http://ahero.uwc.ac.za/index.php?module=cshe&amp;action=downloadfile&amp;fileid=81806115512041001233965 "The Senegalese Scientific Community: Africanization, Dependence and Crisis"] in ''Scientific communities in the developing world''. Jacques Gaillard, V.V. Krishna and Roland Waast(eds). New Delhi, Thousand Oaks, Calif., and London: Sage Publications, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Jules Brévié]], governor of [[French West Africa]] from 1930 to 1936, wrote that "colonization needs scholars, impartial and disinterested researchers with broad vision, outside of the urgency and fire of action. He wanted a methodical research program into colonial history and African culture, and lobbied for an official scientific institute to undertake geographical, ethnographic and historical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=70 |last=Wilder|first=Gary|title=The French Imperial Nation-State: Negritude and Colonial Humanism Between the Two World Wars |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLqOeLn2MfcC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=2015-10-27 |date=2005-12-01|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-89768-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Popular Front government, in 1936, converted the ''Comite d'etudes historiques et scientifiques de l'AOF'' into the Dakar-based IFAN, and placed naturalist [[Théodore Monod]] at its head.
From the opening of the institute in 1938, Monod sought to promote Africans into positions of authority in IFAN, such as ethnologist [[Amadou Hampâté Bâ]].  With the end of the [[Second World War]], an influx of African intellectuals and French radicals (such as [[Jean Suret-Canale]]) found homes in IFAN and its branches, some taking part in political agitation through organisations like the [[Popular Front (Senegal)|Senegalese Popular Front]], the [[African Democratic Rally|RDA]], and the [[Communist Study Groups]] of the 1940s.

As independence loomed in the 1950s, IFAN became an increasingly African institution.  It formed a parallel [[National Archives]] to the Archives of the Governor General in Dakar,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archivesdusenegal.gouv.sn/biblio.html Les Archives Nationales du Sénégal: La Bibliothèque, Présentation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901172440/http://www.archivesdusenegal.gouv.sn/biblio.html |date=2012-09-01 }}. "l'arrêté 4803 du 24 novembre 1947 qui faisait de l'IFAN le dépositaire du dépôt légal".&lt;/ref&gt; with Monod and the IFAN answering directly to the [[Minister of Overseas France]] - a rare degree of autonomy under the [[French West Africa|AOF]] system. By independence IFAN had offices in [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], [[Abidjan]], [[Bamako]], [[Cotonou]], [[Niamey]], [[Ouagadougou]], associated centers in [[Douala]] and [[Lomé]], and permanent scientific research stations in [[Atar]], [[Diafarabé]], and [[Mont-Nimba]]. The 1940s and 50s saw more such projects undertaken, such as the 1943 ''Office of Colonial Scientific Research'' (Now the ORSTOM Soil Research Centre in Dakar-Hann) and the [[University of Dakar]] in 1957.  Each of these institutions, begun as colonial instruments, evolved with the coming of independence into African tools to meet African needs.&lt;ref&gt;See J. Galliard, Passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independence==
By independence in 1960 IFAN had branches across French West Africa, in all the cities which were to become the capitals of independent states.  The Dakar IFAN was transferred to [[Cheikh Anta Diop University]] in 1960, and Monod was kept on as director until 1965. In 1986 it was officially renamed "''IFAN Cheikh Anta Diop''", and maintains budgets, administration and staff independent of the university. It is today one of the most prestigious centers for the study of African culture in the world. As the main cultural research center of the colonies of French West Africa, it contains important collections from across Francophone Africa.  Most branches of IFAN, notably in [[Conakry]] ([[Guinea]]), [[Abidjan]] ([[Cote d'Ivoire]]), and [[Bamako]] ([[Mali]]), became the basis for national archives and research centers. Some still retain the "IFAN" title. The IFAN of [[French Soudan|Soudan Francais]] became the [[National Museum of Mali]], while IFAN of [[French Guinea]] became the ''Institut National de Recherche et Documentation'': the National Library, Archives and Museum of [[Guinea]].

==Publishing==
IFAN publishes a number of academic journals. ''Mémoire de l'IFAN'' and ''{{illm|Bulletin de l'Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire|fr}}'' (abbreviated ''BIFAN'')  mostly deal with [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], history and [[archeology]].&lt;ref&gt;See the bibliographical essay on pp.304-305 of &lt;br /&gt;Peter Duignan, Lewis H. Gann, Victor Witter. ''Colonialism in Africa'', 1870-1960. Cambridge University Press (1975) {{ISBN|0-521-07859-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Centre de Linguistique Appliquée de Dakar, in conjunction with IFAN, has published extensive work on the [[Languages of Africa]], notably the multi-volume ''Lexique Wolof-Français''.  Other sections of IFAN have published collections on everything from the fish to the dance of the West African region.

'''Joanie Louise Cunningham''' is a fictional character, played in an episode of the anthology series ''[[Love, American Style]]'' by [[Susan Neher]] and on the sitcoms ''[[Happy Days]]'' and ''[[Joanie Loves Chachi]]'' by [[Erin Moran]]. She is the daughter of [[Howard Cunningham (Happy Days character)|Howard]] and [[Marion Cunningham (Happy Days character)|Marion Cunningham]], and the younger sister of [[Chuck Cunningham]] and [[Richie Cunningham]]. In early seasons, Joanie is always nosy toward Richie's makeout sessions with his girlfriends. Also, in early seasons, Joanie is a member of a [[Girl Scouts of the USA|girl scout]]-type organization called the "Junior Chipmunks". She develops a brief crush on [[Warren "Potsie" Weber|Potsie]] after he sings to her (see "They Call It Potsie Love" from [[Happy Days (season 3)|Season 3]]). As she grows older, Joanie becomes best friends with the [[promiscuity|promiscuous]] Jenny Piccalo, who is only referred to but [[Unseen character|not revealed onscreen]] until [[Happy Days (season 8)|Season 8]]. Joanie always complains and pouts whenever she is sent to her room by her parents for mischief, talking back, or whenever a conversation ensued that her parents didn't want her to hear.

[[Fonzie]] becomes fond of Joanie, affectionately referring to her as "Shortcake", and, like her brother Richie, Fonzie looks after her well-being. One such notable case occurs in [[Happy Days (season 11)|Season 11]], when Joanie takes a teaching job at the high school where Fonzie and [[Roger Phillips|Roger]] are faculty members. An obnoxious student tries to [[sexual harassment|hit on her]] and Fonzie comes to her rescue. There is another related event that occurs in [[Happy Days (season 4)|Season 4]], when an arrogant classmate of Joanie's beats Joanie out of [[cheerleading]] tryouts; and even though Fonzie is overtly tired from pushing his broken-down motorcycle home, he helps Joanie retaliate by beating her cheerleading rival in a [[dance marathon]]. Also in Season 4; Fonzie, Richie, Potsie, Ralph, and Carmine Ragusa (from ''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley]]'') defend Joanie's honor against a troublesome gang called the Red Devils (see "Joanie's Weird Boyfriend" from [[Happy Days (season 4)|that season]]).

When [[Chachi Arcola|Chachi]] comes to town, he develops a huge crush on Joanie, which for a while went [[unrequited love|unrequited]]. However, Joanie eventually accepts a date with Chachi, making him so overwhelmed with excitement that he inadvertently sets fire to Arnold's (see "Hot Stuff" from [[Happy Days (season 7)|Season 7]]). A serious relationship develops between the two and episode plots were eventually written revolving around the couple. Joanie and Chachi become aspiring musicians, forming their own band, which leads to their short-lived [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[Joanie Loves Chachi]]''. After ''Joanie Loves Chachi'' was cancelled, she and Chachi returned to ''Happy Days'' and become married in the series finale "Passages" from [[Happy Days (season 11)|Season 11]].

The '''Kirriemuir Sculptured Stones''' are a series of Class II and III [[Pictish stones]] found in [[Kirriemuir]], [[Angus, Scotland]]. Their existence points to Kirriemuir being an important ecclesiastical centre in the late first millennium AD.

==Location==
The stones were found in the grounds of Kirriemuir Kirk {{gbmapping|NO38955448}}. The stones are now on display at the [[Meffan Institute]] in [[Forfar]], [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]].

'''Lagostina''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] manufacturer of [[cookware]], [[cutlery]] and other [[kitchenware]]. They are also an important manufacturer of [[pressure cooker]]s. Lagostina was founded in 1901 in [[Omegna]], [[Province of Verbania]], Italy, as a family business initially focusing on [[stainless steel]] flatware.

== History ==
=== 1901–1930 : A region that drives men to surpass themselves ===
''Lagostina'' was born in the [[Piedmont]], in [[Omegna]], on the shores of [[Lake Orta]], a region famous for handcrafted household goods production, the company was founded by Carlo Lagostina and his son Emilio. 

The metalcrafters gradually settled in this country where the economy was based mainly on [[wood]], and contributed to the beginnings of industrial progress. The distribution of [[electric power]], the development of railway network and the presence of a skilled workforce heavily impulsed the industrial boom. 
 
''Lagostina'' was created in 1901 and quickly became an expert in the manufacture of tinned iron flatware. In the early 30's, the flatware production reached up to 30 000 pieces per day and included among its main customers the Navy, Army and Aeronautics.

=== 1932–1956 : The beginnings of stainless steel ===
Massimo Lagostina, grandnephew of the founder, launched the first [[stainless steel]] [[kitchen tool]]s . This material, totally new for this purpose but already known for its aesthetic qualities and its robustness, enables ''Lagostina'' to express the Italian style art of living. 

In 1929, at the Fair of [[Milan]], Massimo saw the first [[stainless steel]] sheets. In the United States and Sweden, industrial production of this [[alloy]] began after a long period of studies and experiences . At that time the first products manufactured for the chemical and food industries were experimented. Massimo quickly understood that this material could also be used successfully in the field of [[kitchen tool]]s. 
 

In Italy, the first collection of [[stainless steel]] kitchenware was created in 1934 by ''Lagostina'' : « Casa Mia ». The range bore the famous logo of "the little house with smoking chimney" and a met great success, immortalized in 1956 in an exhibition at the [[MoMA|Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA)]]. 

At that time, selling steel pots and pans was not easy and Massimo faced the challenge to impose these new ranges. He made great efforts to make his new and much more expensive products accepted  on the market. The first customers were communities, hospitals, liners but also department stores such as [[La Rinascente]] in [[Milan]]. The first retailers were mainly located in the [[Piedmont]] and [[Lombardy]]. 

Meanwhile, the rise of ''Lagostina'' continues through the manufacturing of technical parts for the [[aircraft industry]] until 1940. Indeed, demand for technical parts strongly increases during the War.

=== 1957–1971: The success of stainless steel ===
The years 1956–1957 showed the end of tinned iron production. It was a turning point for ''Lagostina'': the manufacturing process went from manual era to more mechanized manufacturing.

The company established its own research and development laboratory in order to promote the development of innovative processes. 
The industrial boom inexorably went ahead in 1955 with the launch of the first thermodiffusion base: Thermoplan, which provides excellent [[thermal conductivity|heat conductivity]] across the bottom of the product. 1960 marks the birth of the ''Lagostina'' [[pressure cooker]], with its system of closure and openness so characteristic : with a  lever and a flexible cover, the product is entirely made of [[stainless steel]] whereas in rest of Europe, this type of product is still made of aluminium.

Thus a new plant and new office were built with the help of the architect Carlo Mazzeri, who had already participated as a designer to create the Moon Line handles and the kettle with Thermoplan base. Coming years dedicated to export, to [[Canada]] and particularly to [[France]] where a sales subsidiary was founded in 1967. 
During those years, ''Lagostina'' kept on drawing attention by an innovative and humorous communication such as [[La Linea (TV series)|"The Line" (La Linea)]] created by [[Osvaldo Cavandoli]]. ''Lagostina'' became one of the first Italian companies to understand the importance of [[advertising]].

Other famous designers helped the brand to establish its awareness and strong personality. Thus, [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] designed the "Atmosphere" [[pressure cooker]] and the « Modia ».

=== 1972–2001: The establishment of a prestigious image dedicated to Culinary Art ===
This last part of the 20th century was characterized by a process of [[Diversification (marketing strategy)|diversification]] of ranges. Indeed, over the years, ''Lagostina'' had adapted its production to changing culinary methods and flavors: in the 80’s, a new function for the [[pressure cooker]] appears :the "steam cooking"; and the launch in 1986 of the "Pastaoila", a special pot to cook and drain pasta.

=== 2005: A new approach based on the original culture of the brand ===
''Lagostina'' become a brand of [[Groupe SEB]] in 2004 and its positioning and identity are redefined in order to re-establish its high-end image.

In 2009, ''Lagostina'' works jointly with the famous Swiss photographer Steeve Iuncker in order to pay homage to Italian women who cook,from generation to generation, the best pasta in the world. Lagostina publishes the book « PASTA » : through a gallery of portraits, the reader gets to know Emanuela, Antonella, Lucia ... Modern Italian women who wished to share their culinary secrets under the lens of the photographer.

== Products ==
Lagostina produces premium cookware features such as stoves, pots, pans, cast iron pots and tableware (services, flatware ...).

Although labeled as Italian, their products are now made in China.

== Innovations ==
Among the last innovations of the brand, there is « Melodia Triply » and, most of all, the new [[pressure cooker]]s Domina and Maga with new open-close patented system « Easy Opening ».

In 2009, Lagostina launches La Collezione Rossa, a worldwide innovation in the field of cookware. This collection is the result of a unique technological process (Steel&amp;Color) allowing the fusion of [[steel]] with color . The collection was awarded by the famous prize [[Red Dot Design Award]] 2009.

'''Lean product development''' ('''LPD''') is a [[Lean manufacturing|lean]] approach to counter the challenges of [[New product development|product development]], notably:
* Lack of innovative solutions
* Long [[development cycle]] times
* Many [[redevelopment]] cycles
* High development costs
* Long [[production cycle]] times
* High [[production cost]]s

==History of lean product development==
[[Toyota]] started its journey with lean product development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimoto|first1=Shoji|title=Quest for the Dawn|date=1991|publisher=Dougherty Co|isbn=1878150014|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Toyota Loom Works (see [[History of Toyota]]). Their early approach is notably different from the lean manufacturing that became famous through the book "[[The Machine That Changed the World (book)|The Machine that changed the world]]".

When Toyota started manufacturing cars, there was a difference in manufacturing conditions between Japan and the USA. Toyota had few educated engineers and little prior experience. Car companies in US employed a well-educated work force in the cities and benefited from the research and student skill-sets of established engineering schools. To tackle this shortfall in knowledge and experience, Toyota conducted an incremental approach to development that built on their existing knowledge and became the basis of the lean systems Toyota uses today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ward|first1=Allen|title=Lean Product and Process Development|publisher=LEI|isbn=978-1934109137|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sato|first1=Masaaki|title=The Toyota Leaders: An Executive Guide|date=December 16, 2008|publisher=Vertical|isbn=978-1934287231|pages=40–45|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen Ward studied Toyota’s lean product development system and found parallels with the US [[airplane industry]]. For instance, the Wright brothers’ method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melvin|first1=Bob|title=Knowledge Based Product Development: A Practical Guide|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=1492705969|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; of constructing their airplanes became one of the legacies they passed on to the aviation industry. This approach enabled the USA to create one of World War II's most successful fighter planes from scratch in the short span of six months. After the war, Toyota incorporated many of the airline industry's findings into its own product development methodology.

==Differences between lean product development and lean production==
While some basic principles and guidelines are applicable across lean product development and lean production (such as waste reduction), many applications of lean process for development have focused more on the production approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lean.enst.fr/wiki/pub/Lean/LesPublications/LeanDevBalleBalle.pdf|title=Lean Development|publisher=Business Strategy Review|last2=Ballé|first2=Freddy|pages=17–22|last1=Ballé|first1=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of production is to manufacture products reliably within margins of control. The flow of value is physically evident, and the link between cause and effect is easy to see. For example, feedback on adjusting the speed of production is immediately realized in an increase or decrease in rejected items. Any decisions made must be based on best practice.

On the other hand, the purpose of product development is to design new products that improve the lives of customers. This is a complex space where the flow of value can only be discerned at an abstract level and where cause and effect might be separated by time and space. For example, feedback on the decision to design a certain feature will not be received until the product has been built and is in the hands of the customer. This means that decisions are made on short-cycle experimentation, prototyping, set-based design, and emergent practice. A premium is placed on creating reusable knowledge and reducing risk at handover points.

An essential point about these differences is summarized in the advice Jim Womack gives Harley Davidson: "''Don't try to bring lean manufacturing upstream to product development. The application of Lean in product development and manufacturing are different. Some aspects may look similar, but they are not! Be leery of an expert with experience in lean manufacturing that claims to know product development''" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oosterwal|first1=Dantar|title=The Lean Machine|date=January 13, 2010|publisher=Productivity Press|isbn=978-0814432884|pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common high level concepts associated with lean product development are:
# [[Knowledge creation|Creation of re-usable knowledge]]. Knowledge is created and maintained so that it can be leveraged for successive products or iterations. 
# Set-based [[concurrent engineering]]. Different stages of product development run simultaneously rather than consecutively to decrease development time, improve productivity, and reduce costs.  
# Teams of responsible experts. Lean product development organizations develop cross-functional teams and reward competence building in teams and individuals.
# Cadence and pull. Managers of lean product development organizations develop autonomous teams, where engineers plan their own work and work their own plans.  
# Visual management. [[Information graphics|Visualization]] is a main enabler of lean product development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmdahl|first1=Lars|title=Visual Management in Lean Product Development|isbn=978-91-979196-1-6|pages=1–15|url=http://www.larsholmdahl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Entrepreneurial system designer. The lean product development organization makes one person responsible for the engineering and aesthetic design, and market and business success, of the product.

== Results of lean product development ==
Lean product development has been claimed to produce the following results:
* Increase innovation ten-fold&lt;ref name=ward&gt;Allen Ward - Lean Product and Process Development&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increase introduction of new products 400%-500% &lt;ref name=ward/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oosterwal|first1=Dantar|title=The Lean Machine|date=January 13, 2010|publisher=Productivity Press|isbn=978-0814432884|pages=237–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies such as Toyota can attribute their success to lean product development. In 2000, Toyota launched 14 new products, a larger product line than GM's entire product offering. At that point, Toyota had just 70,000 employees while GM had more than five times as many.&lt;ref name=ward/&gt;

==  Applicability of lean product development ==

Researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ottosson|first1=Stig|title=Handbook in Innovation Management|date=2006|publisher=www.complexityforum.com|url=http://www.complexityforum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; divide product development projects accordingly to their need drivers:
* '''Wished''': there is no such product on the market, only a wish for such a product. These projects can be on the edge of what is possible to do.
* '''Wanted''': there are only a few basic similar products on the market that usually require improvement.
* '''Needed''': there are enough products in existence so knowledge about this is abundant on the market.

For example, the mobile phone was a ''Wanted'' product in the 1990s because it was on the leading edge of technology. Today it is regarded as a ''Needed'' product. It is common in the market. There is enough knowledge in the public domain so that even small companies can make a good mobile phone.

Product development methods can be classified according to whether they are focused on handling stable or non-stable conditions. Lean product development is a dynamic method of product development that handles unstable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmdahl|first1=Lars|title=Visual Management in Lean Product Development|isbn=978-91-979196-1-6|pages=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of need drivers and stability (or lack of stability) on product development are illustrated in the table below.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2018}}

| [[Setting (narrative)|Setting]] || The setting is both the time and geographic location within a narrative or within a work of fiction. A [[literary element]], the setting initiates the main backdrop and mood of a story, often referred to as the story world.||The novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]] is set in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], the action taking place on a single day, 16 June 1904. The action of the novel takes place from one side of [[Dublin Bay]] to the other, opening in [[Sandycove]] to the South of the city and closing on [[Howth Head]] to the North. While the novel parallels the story of [[Odysseus]], the hero of [[Homer]]'s epic poem ''[[Odyssey]]'', whose role is carried by [[Leopold Bloom]], much of the setting is described realistically, with great attention to detail. The locations within Dublin also represent locations in the Odyssey. Bloom’s home is at 7 Eccles Street, and at the same time, Ithaca, the home of Odysseus. The Post office, [[Westland Row]] and Sweny’s pharmacy in Lombard Street represent the Dublin location for  [[Ulysses (novel)#Episode 5.2C Lotus Eaters|Episode 5, Lotus Eaters]]; the [[National Library of Ireland]] parallels [[Ulysses (novel)#Episode 9.2C Scylla and Charybdis|Episode 9, Scylla and Charybdis]] and so on.

In a way, Gollum does what Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring intended to do through the whole plot of the trilogy, which was to throw the ring into the lake of fire in the heart of Mount Doom.

| [[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]] (or analeptic reference) || General term for altering time sequences, taking characters back to the beginning of the tale, for instance || The story of "[[The Three Apples]]" in ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' tale begins with the discovery of a young woman's dead body. After the murderer later reveals himself, he narrates his reasons for the murder as a flashback of events leading up to the discovery of her dead body at the beginning of the story.
|- valign="top"
| [[Flashforward]] || Also called [[Flashforward|prolepsis]], a scene that temporarily jumps the narrative forward in time. Flashforwards often represent events expected, projected, or imagined to occur in the future. They may also reveal significant parts of the story that have not yet occurred, but soon will in greater detail. || Occurs in ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' when Mr. Scrooge visits the ghost of the future. It is also frequent in the later seasons of the television series [[Lost (TV series)|Lost]].
|- valign="top"
| [[Foreshadowing]] || Implicit yet intentional efforts of an author to suggest events which have yet to take place in the process of narration. See also [[repetitive designation]] and [[Chekhov's gun]] || A narration might begin with a male character who has to break up a schoolyard fight among some boys who are vying for the attention of a girl, which was introduced to foreshadow the events leading to a dinner time squabble between the character and his twin brother over a woman, whom both are courting at the same time.
|- valign="top"
| [[Frame story]], or a [[story within a story]] || A main story that hatches a linking series of shorter stories. || Early examples include ''[[Panchatantra]]'', ''[[Kalila and Dimna]]'', ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', and ''[[The Decameron]]''. More modern examples are [[Brian Jacques]]’s 1999 ''[[The Legend of Luke]]'' and [[Ramsay Wood]]’s 2011 ''[[Kalila and Dimna]]'' update, subtitled ''Fables of Conflict and Intrigue''.
|- valign="top"
| [[Framing device]] || A single action, scene, event, setting, or any element of significance at the beginning and end of a work. The use of framing devices allows frame stories to exist. ||  In ''Arabian Nights'', Scheherazade, the newly wed wife to the King, is the framing device. As a character, she is telling the "1,001 stories" to the King, in order to delay her execution night by night. However, as a framing device her purpose for existing is to tell the same 1,001 stories to the reader.
|- valign="top"
| [[MacGuffin]] || A [[plot device]] coined by Alfred Hitchcock referring to some goal, desired object, or other motivator that the [[protagonist]] pursues, often with little or no narrative explanation as to why it is considered so important.||In Hitchcock’s The 39 Steps the MacGuffin is a mysterious set of “military secrets.” No one knows what they are, and in the end they mean almost nothing. For all its power, mystery, and danger, The One Ring in [[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]] is a MacGuffin that saves the world. The stuff that dreams are made of. The [[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|Maltese Falcon]] is a powerful MacGuffin in the film of the same name, a supposedly jewel encrusted black bird which creates the greed which propels every character, even the hero. 
|- valign="top"
| ''[[In medias res]]'' || Beginning the story in the middle of a sequence of events. A specific form of narrative hook. || The ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' of Homer are prime examples. The latter work begins with the return of Odysseus to his home of Ithaka and then in flashbacks tells of his ten years of wandering following the Trojan War.
|- valign="top"
| [[Narrative hook]] || Story opening that "hooks" readers' attention so they will keep reading || Any non-fiction book is often introduced with an interesting factoid.
|- valign="top"
| [[Ochi]] || A sudden interruption of the wordplay flow indicating the end of a [[rakugo]] or a kobanashi. || A Rakugo is a Japanese verbal entertainment usually lasting 30 minutes which ends with a surprise punch line, a narrative stunt known as ochi (fall) or sage(lowering). Twelve kinds of ochi are codified and recognized. The earlier '''kobanashi was a sh'''ort comical vignette ending with an ochi.
|- valign="top"
| [[Plot twist]] || Unexpected change ("twist") in the direction or expected outcome of the plot. See also [[twist ending]]. || An early example is the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' tale "[[The Three Apples]]". A locked chest found by a fisherman contains a dead body, and two different men claim to be the murderer, which turns out to be the investigator's own slave.
|- valign="top"
| [[Poetic justice]] || Virtue ultimately rewarded, or vice punished, by an ironic twist of fate related to the character's own conduct || Wile E. Coyote coming up with a contraption to catch the Road Runner, only to be foiled and caught by his own devices. Each sin's punishment in [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's ''Inferno'']] is a symbolic instance of poetic justice.
|- valign="top"
| [[Predestination paradox]] || Time travel paradox where a time traveler is caught in a loop of events that "predestines" them to travel back in time || In ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the main character repeatedly finds himself under the obligation of having to travel back in time because of something his future character has done.
|- valign="top"
| [[Quibble (plot device)|Quibble]] || Plot device based on an argument that an agreement's intended meaning holds no legal value, and that only the exact, literal words agreed on apply. || For example, William Shakespeare used a quibble in ''The Merchant of Venice'': Portia saves Antonio in a court of law by pointing out that the agreement called for a pound of flesh, but no blood, so Shylock can collect only if he sheds no blood.
|- valign="top"
| [[Red herring (idiom)|Red herring]] || Diverting attention away from an item of significance. || For example, in mystery fiction, an innocent party may be purposefully cast as highly suspicious through emphasis or descriptive techniques to divert attention from the true guilty party.
|- valign="top"
| [[Self-fulfilling prophecy]] || Prediction that, by being made, makes itself come true. || Early examples include the legend of [[Oedipus]], and the story of [[Krishna]] in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''. There is also an example of this in ''[[Harry Potter]]'' when Lord Voldemort heard a prophecy (made by Sybill Trelawney to Dumbledore) that a boy born at the end of July, whose parents had defied Voldemort thrice and survived, would be made marked as his equal. Because of this prophecy, Lord Voldemort sought out Harry Potter (believing him to be the boy spoken of) and tried to kill him. His parents died protecting him, and when Voldemort tried to cast a killing curse on Harry, it rebounded and took away most of his strength, and gave Harry Potter a unique ability and connection with the Dark Lord thus marking him as his equal.
|- valign="top"
| ''[[Story within a story]]'' (Hypodiegesis) || A story told within another story. See also [[frame story]]. || In Stephen King's ''The Wind Through the Keyhole'', of the Dark Tower series, the protagonist tells a story from his past to his companions, and in this story he tells another relatively unrelated story.
|- valign="top"
| [[Ticking clock scenario]] || Threat of impending disaster—often used in thrillers where salvation and escape are essential elements || In the TV show "24", the main character, Jack Bauer often finds himself interrogating a terrorist who is caught in order to disarm a bomb.
|- valign="top"
|- valign="top"
| [[Chekhov's gun]] || A dramatic principle that requires every element in a narrative to be irreplaceable, with anything else removed.|| "Remove everything that has no relevance to the story. If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there." —  Anton Chekhov
|- valign="top"
| [[Unreliable narrator]] || The narrator of the story is not sincere, or introduces a bias in their narration and possibly misleads the reader, hiding or minimizing events, characters, or motivations. || An example is ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]''. The novel includes an unexpected [[plot twist]] at the end of the novel. In the last chapter, Sheppard describes how he was an [[unreliable narrator]].

|- valign="top"
|  Audience surrogate || A character who expresses the questions and confusion of the audience, with whom the audience can identify. Frequently used in detective fiction and science fiction, where the character asks a central character how he or she accomplished certain deeds, for the purpose of inciting that character to explain (for the curious audience) his or her methods, or a character asking a relatively educated person to explain what amounts to the backstory. ||  Dr Watson in the Sherlock Holmes stories. [[Scott Evil]], played by Seth Green, son of Dr. Evil on the [[Austin Powers movies]].
|- valign="top"
| [[Author surrogate]] || Characters which are based on authors, usually to support their personal views. Sometimes an intentionally or unintentionally idealized version of them. A variation is the [[Mary Sue]] or Gary Stu, which primarily serves as an idealized self-insertion. || Socrates in the writings of Plato. Plato never speaks in his own voice in his dialogues. In the [[Second Letter (Plato)|''Second Letter'']], it says, "no writing of Plato exists or ever will exist, but those now said to be his are those of a Socrates become beautiful and new”.
|- valign="top"
| Breaking the [[fourth wall]] || An author or character addresses the audience directly (also known as [[direct address]]). This may acknowledge to the reader or audience that what is being presented is fiction, or may seek to extend the world of the story to provide the illusion that they are included in it. || The characters in ''[[Sesame Street]]'' often break the fourth wall when they address their viewers as part of the ongoing storyline, which is possible because of the high level of suspension of belief afforded by its audience—children. The American political drama show ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'' also uses this technique frequently to let the viewers know what the main character [[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|Frank Underwood]] is thinking and planning.
|- valign="top"
| [[Defamiliarization]] ||  Taking an everyday object and presenting it in a way that is weirdly unfamiliar so that we see the object in a new way. Coined by the early 20th-century Russian literary critic Viktor Shklovsky in "Art as Technique." || In, Swift’s ''Gulliver's Travels'' when Gulliver visits the land of the giants and sees a giant woman’s skin he sees it is anything but smooth and beautiful when viewed up close.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/literature-glossary/defamiliarization.html|title=Literature Glossary - Defamiliarization|website=www.shmoop.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|- valign="top"
| [[First-person narrative|First-person narration]] || A text presented from the point of view of a character, especially the protagonist, as if the character is telling the story themselves. (Breaking the fourth wall is an option, but not a necessity, of this format.) || [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' uses the title character as the narrator, while ''[[Sherlock Holmes]]'' is primarily told from Watson's perspective.
|- valign="top"
| [[Magical realism]] || Describing events in a real-world setting but with magical trappings, often incorporating local customs and invented beliefs. Different from [[urban fantasy]] in that the magic itself is not the focus of the story. || Particularly popular with [[Latin America]]n authors like [[Gabriel García Márquez]] and [[Jorge Luis Borges]]. Elsewhere, Salman Rushdie's work provides good examples.
|- valign="top"
| [[Multiperspectivity]] || A narrative that is told from the [[Narration#Narrative point of view|viewpoint]]s of multiple characters that incorporate various perspectives, emotions, and views from witnesses or actors to varying particular events or circumstances that might not be felt by other characters in the story. ||  The films of [[Robert Altman]]. 2666 by [[Roberto Bolaño|Roberto Bolano]] features European literary critics, a Chilean philosophy professor, an African-American journalist, detectives investigating Santa Teresa murders and an obscure German writer named Benno Von Archimboldi. [[Pale Fire]] by Vladimir Nabokov features literature professor John Shade,  Charles Kinbote, a neighbor and colleague of Shade’s and Charles the Beloved, king of Zembla. Kinbote is the ultimate unreliable commentator.
|- valign="top"
| [[Narration#Second-person|Second-person narration]] || A text written in the style of a direct address, in the second-person. || ''[[Homestuck]]''.
|- valign="top"
| [[Stream of consciousness writing|Stream of consciousness]] || The author uses narrative and stylistic devices to create the sense of an unedited [[interior monologue]], characterized by leaps in syntax and punctuation that trace a character's fragmentary thoughts and sensory feelings. The outcome is a highly lucid perspective with a plot. Not to be confused with [[free writing]]. || An example is ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. At one point Leopold Bloom saunters through Dublin musing on “Pineapple rock, lemon platt, butter scotch. A sugar-sticky girl shovelling scoopful of creams for a Christian brother. Some school treat. Bad for their tummies.”
|- valign="top"
| [[Third-person narrative|Third-person narration]] || A text written as if by an impersonal narrator who is not affected by the events in the story. Can be omniscient or limited, the latter usually being tied to a specific character, a group of characters, or a location. || ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' is written in multiple limited third-person narrators that change with each chapter. ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' uses an omniscient narrator.

|- valign="top"
| [[Alliteration]] || Repeating the same letter or consonant sound at the beginning of adjacent or closely connected words. || In the film ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' the main character performs a couple of soliloquies with a heavy use of alliteration, e.g., "Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished, as the once vital voice of the verisimilitude now venerates what they once vilified. However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose vis-à-vis an introduction, and so it is my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V."
|- valign="top"
| [[Amplification (rhetoric)]] || Amplification refers to a literary practice wherein the writer embellishes the sentence by adding more information to it in order to increase its worth and understanding. || E.g., Original sentence: The thesis paper was difficult. After amplification: The thesis paper was difficult: it required extensive research, data collection, sample surveys, interviews and a lot of fieldwork.
|- valign="top"
| [[Anagram]] || Rearranging the letters of a word or a phrase to form a new phrase or word.|| E.g., An anagram for "debit card" is "bad credit". As you can see, both phrases use the same letters. By mixing the letters a bit of humor is created.
|- valign="top"
| [[Asyndeton]] || When sentences do not use conjunctions (e.g., and, or, nor) to separate clauses, but run clauses into one another, usually marking the separation of clauses with punctuation. || An example is when [[John F.

|- valign="top"
| [[Bathos]] || An abrupt transition in style from the exalted to the commonplace, producing a ludicrous effect.  While often unintended, bathos may be used deliberately to produce a humorous effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=Robert Hartwell|title=Robert Hartwell Fiske's Dictionary of Unendurable English: A Compendium of Mistakes in Grammar, Usage, and Spelling with commentary on lexicographers and linguists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZqfZfIvtlsC&amp;pg=PA71|date=1 November 2011 |publisher=Scribner|isbn=978-1-4516-5134-8|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abrams|first1=Meyer Howard|last2=Harpham|first2=Geoffrey Galt|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9VkYJuVn9YC&amp;pg=PA24 |year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4130-3390-8|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;||: The ballerina rose gracefully en pointe and extended one slender leg behind her, like a dog at a fire hydrant.

|- valign="top"
| [[Caesura]] || A break, especially a sense pause, usually near the middle of a verse, and marked in [[scansion]] by a double vertical line. This technique frequently occurs within a poetic line grammatically connected to the end of the previous line by [[enjambment]].|| E.g., in "Know then thyself. ‖ Presume not God to scan."
|- valign="top"
| [[Distancing effect]] || Deliberately preventing the audience from identifying with characters in order to let them be coolly scrutinized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Allen|title=Roland Barthes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o4Sg_gx3soIC&amp;pg=PA29|date=2 June 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-134-50341-5|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;|| Popularized by 20th century playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]].
|- valign="top"
| Dramatic visualization || Representing an object or character with abundant descriptive detail, or mimetically rendering gestures and dialogue to make a scene more visual or imaginatively present to an audience. || This technique appears at least as far back as the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Heath| title=Reviewed work(s): ''Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights'' by David Pinault|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|volume=26|issue=2|date=May 1994|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=358–360|doi=10.1017/s0020743800060633}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|- valign="top"
| [[Euphuism]] || An artificial, highly elaborate way of writing or speaking. Named from ''Euphues'' (1579) the prose romance by [[John Lyly]]. || "Is it not far better to abhor sins by the remembrance of others' faults, than by repentance of thine own follies?" (Euphues, 1, lecture by the wise Neapolitan)
|- valign="top"
| [[Hyperbole]] ||Exaggeration used to evoke strong feelings or create an impression which is not meant to be taken literally. || Sally could no longer hide her secret. Her pregnant belly was bigger than the planet on which she stood.
|- valign="top"
| [[Imagery]] ||Forming mental images of a scene using descriptive words, especially making use of the human senses. The same as ''sensory detail.'' || When the boots came off his feet with a leathery squeak, a smell of ferment and fish market immediately filled the small tent. The skin of his toes were red and raw and sensitive. The malodorous air was so toxic he thought he could almost taste his toes.
|- valign="top"
| [[Leitwortstil]] || Purposefully repeating words that usually express a motif or [[Theme (literature)|theme]] important to the story. || This dates back at least to the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]''.&lt;ref name=Heath-360&gt;Heath (1994) p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;
|- valign="top"
| [[Metonymy]] || Word or phrase in a figure of speech in which a noun is referenced by something closely associated with it, rather than explicitly by the noun itself. This is not to be confused with [[synecdoche]], in which a part of the whole stands for the thing itself. || Metonomy: The boxer threw in the towel. Synecdoche: She gave her hand in marriage.
|- valign="top"
| [[Overstatement]] || Exaggerating something, often for emphasis (also known as [[hyperbole]]) || Sally's pregnant belly most likely weighed as much as the scooter she used to ride before she got pregnant.
|- valign="top"
| [[Onomatopoeia]] || Words that imitate/spell a sound or noise.
Word that sounds the same as, or similar to what the word means.

Refer to comic books for the best examples.
| "Boom goes the dynamite."
"Bang!"

"Bark."
|- valign="top"
| [[Oxymoron]] || A term made of two words that deliberately or coincidentally imply each other's opposite. || "terrible beauty"
|- valign="top"
| [[Paradox (literature)|Paradox]] || A phrase that describes an idea composed of concepts that conflict. || "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times." (''A Tale of Two Cities'')
|- valign="top"
| [[Parody]] || Ridicule by overstated imitation, usually humorous. || ''[[MAD Magazine]]''
|- valign="top"
| [[Pastiche]] ||Using forms and styles from another author, generally as an affectionate tribute. || Such as the many stories featuring [[Sherlock Holmes]] not written by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], or much of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]].
|- valign="top"
| [[Pathos]] || Emotional appeal, one of the three [[modes of persuasion]] in rhetoric that the author uses to inspire pity or sorrow towards a character—typically does not counterbalance the target character's suffering with a positive outcome, as in Tragedy. || In Romeo and Juliet, the two main characters each commit suicide at the sight of the supposedly dead lover, however the audience knows these actions to be rash and unnecessary. Therefore, Shakespeare makes for the emotional appeal for the unnecessary tragedy behind the young characters' rash interpretations about love and life.
|- valign="top"
| [[Polyptoton]] || Words derived from the same root in a sentence.|| "Not as a call to '''battle''', though '''embattled''' we are." [[John F. Kennedy]], ''Inaugural Address'', January 20, 1961.
|- valign="top"
| [[Polysyndeton]] || Polysyndeton is the use of several conjunctions in close succession, this provides a sense of exaggeration designed to wear down the audience. || An example of this is in the first chapter of [[Great Expectations]] by [[Charles Dickens]]: "A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared and growled; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin"
|- valign="top"
| [[Satire]] || The use of humor, irony or exaggeration to criticize. || An example is ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]]''. One of the earliest examples is Gullivers Travels, written by Jonathan Swift. The television program [[South Park]] is another.
|- valign="top"
| [[Mental imagery|Sensory detail]] || sight, sound, taste, touch, smell. The same as ''imagery'' || The boot was tough and sinewy between his hard-biting teeth. There was no flavor to speak of except for the blandness of all the dirt that the boot had soaked up over the years. The only thing the boot reminded him of was the smell of a wet-dog.
|- valign="top"
| [[Understatement]] || A diminishing or softening of a theme or effect. || The broken ends of the long bone were sticking through the bleeding skin, but it wasn't something that always killed a man.

|- valign="top"
| [[Irony]] || This discrepancy between expectation and reality occurs in three forms: situational irony, where a situation features a discrepancy between what is expected and what is actualized; dramatic irony, where a character is unaware of pivotal information already revealed to the audience (the discrepancy here lies in the two levels of awareness between the character and the audience); and verbal irony, where one states one thing while meaning another. The difference between verbal irony and sarcasm is exquisitely subtle and often contested. The concept of irony is too often misunderstood in popular usage. Unfortunate circumstances and coincidences do not constitute irony (nor do they qualify as being ''tragic''). See the ''Usage controversy'' section under [[irony]], and the term [[tragedy]]. || A person hears a prophecy about himself. His endeavor to stop the prophecy from coming true, makes it come true.
|- valign="top"
| [[Metaphor]] || Evoking imagination by means of using figurative language. || Her tears were a river flowing down her cheeks.
|- valign="top"
| [[Thematic patterning]] || Distributing recurrent thematic concepts and moralistic [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] among various incidents and frames of a story. In a skillfully crafted tale, thematic patterning may emphasize the unifying argument or salient idea disparate events and disparate frames have in common. || Each of the chapters of Ulysses by James Joyce.

|- valign="top"
| [[Hamartia]] || The character flaw of an initially rich and powerful hero that leads to his tragic downfall.  This is also referred to as the tragic flaw. || [[Oedipus]] kills his own father because he doesn't understand his true parentage.
|- valign="top"
| [[Pathetic fallacy#In literature|Pathetic fallacy]] || Reflecting a character's (usually the protagonist) mood in the atmosphere or inanimate objects.

This is a list of women who engaged in war, found throughout [[mythology]] and [[folklore]], studied in fields such as [[literature]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[film studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[women's studies]]. A ''mythological'' figure does not always mean a ''fictional'' one, but rather, someone of whom stories have been told that have entered the cultural heritage of a people. Some women warriors are documented in the written record and as such form part of [[history]] (e.g. the [[Ancient Briton]] queen [[Boudica]], who led the [[Iceni]] into battle against the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]).

===Rashidun Caliphate===
[[Khawlah bint al-Azwar]] was the daughter of one of the chiefs of [[Bani Assad]] tribe, and her family embraced Islam in its first days. The recorded history of that era mentions repeatedly the feats of Khawla in battles that took place in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. In one instance, she fought in disguise as a man to rescue her brother Derar after the Romans captured him. The Romans eventually lost the battle and fled. When her identity was discovered, the commander of the Moslem army was very impressed with her courage, and he allowed her to lead the attack against the fleeing Romans; they were defeated and the prisoners were all released. In another battle in Ajnadin, Khawla's spear broke, and her mare was killed, and she found herself a prisoner. But she was astonished to find that the Romans attacked the women camp and captured several of them. Their leader gave the prisoners to his commanders, and ordered Khawla to be moved into his tent. She was furious, and decided that to die is more honorable than living in disgrace. She stood among the other women, and called them to fight for their freedom and honor or die. They took the tents' poles and pegs and attacked the Roman guards, keeping a formation of a tight circle, as she told them. Khawla led the attack, killed the first guard with her pole, with the other women following her. According to Al Wakidi, they managed to kill 30 Roman soldiers, five of whom were killed by Khawla herself, including the soldier who wanted to rape her. She was a brunette, tall, slim and of great beauty, and she was also a distinguished poet.

But after the Moslem archers disobeyed their orders and began deserting their high ground believing victory was at hand, the tide of the battle changed, and it appeared that defeat was imminent. When this occurred, Nusaybah entered the battle, carrying a sword and shield. She shielded Muhammad from the arrows of the enemy, and received several wounds while fighting. She was highly praised by Muhammad on her courage and heroism. During the battle her son was wounded and she cut off the leg of the aggressor.

*[[Ashtart]] [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] "ʻštrt" (ʻAshtart); and Hebrew עשתרת (Ashtoreth, singular, or Ashtarot, plural); Greek ([[Astarte]]) is the  Phoenician counterpart to the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian]] [[Inanna]] and to the cognate Babylonian goddess Ishtar as well as the Greek Aphrodite. She is a goddess of fertility, sexual love, and war. Ashtoreth is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as a foreign, non-Judahite goddess, the principal goddess of the homeland of the Phoenicians which is in modern-day [[Lebanon]], representing the productive power of nature. [[Herodotus]] wrote that the religious community of Aphrodite originated in Phoenicia (modern day Lebanon) and came to Greeks from there. He also wrote about the world's largest temple of Aphrodite, in one of the Phoenician cities.
*Tanit is a Phoenician lunar goddess, worshiped as the patron goddess at Carthage. Her shrine excavated at Sarepta in southern Phoenicia (Carthage) revealed an inscription that identified her for the first time in her homeland (Phoenicia of the Levant) and related her securely to the Phoenician goddess Astarte/Ashtart. In Egyptian, her name means Land of Neith, Neith being a war goddess. Long after the fall of Carthage, Tanit is still venerated in North Africa under the Latin name of Juno Caelestis, for her identification with the Roman goddess Juno. Hvidberg-Hansen (Danish professor of Semitic philology), notes that Tanit is sometimes depicted with a lion's head, showing her warrior quality. In modern times the name, with the spelling "Tanith", has been used as a female given name, both for real people and, more frequently, in occult fiction. From the 5th century BC  onwards, Tanit is associated with that of Ba`al Hammon. She is given the epithet pene baal ("face of Baal") and the title rabat, the female form of rab (chief).

When Velu Nachiyar finds the place where the British stock their ammunition, she builds the first human bomb. A faithful follower, Kuyili douses herself in oil, lights herself and walks into the storehouse. Rani Velu Nachiyar formed a woman's army named “udaiyaal” in honour of her adopted daughter — Udaiyaal, who died detonating a British arsenal.

===Hinduism===
*[[Durga]] ({{lang-sa|"the inaccessible"&lt;ref&gt;"Durga." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 25 February  2007 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9363243/Durga"&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}} or "the invincible",&lt;ref&gt;"Durga" Sanatan Society &lt;http://www.sanatansociety.org/hindu_gods_and_goddesses/durga.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-bn|দুর্গা}}) is a form of [[Devi]], the supreme [[goddess]] of [[Hinduism]]. According to the narrative from the [[Devi Mahatmya]] of the [[Markandeya Purana]], the form of Durga was created as a warrior goddess to fight a demon. The nine-day holiday dedicated to Durga, ''The [[Durga Puja]],'' is the biggest annual festival in [[Bengal]] and other parts of Eastern India and is celebrated by Hindus all over the world.
*[[Kālī]] ({{lang-sa|काली}}, {{IPA-sa|kɑːliː|IPA}}; {{lang-bn|কালী}}; {{lang-pa|ਕਾਲੀ}};  {{lang-si|කාලි}}; {{lang-te|కాళికాదేవి}}; {{lang-kn|ಕಾಳಿ ಮಾತಾ}}; {{lang-ta|காளி}}), also known as '''{{IAST|Kālikā}}''' ({{lang-sa|कालिका}}, {{lang-bn|কালিকা}}), is the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[goddess]] associated with empowerment, [[shakti]]. The name Kali comes from ''kāla'', which means black, time, death, lord of death, and thus another name for [[Shiva]]. Kali means "the black one".  Although sometimes presented as dark and violent, her earliest incarnation as a figure of annihilation still has some influence. In Kāli's most famous myth, [[Durga]] and her assistants, the [[Matrikas]], wound the demon [[Raktabija]], in various ways and with a variety of weapons in an attempt to destroy him.  They soon find that they have worsened the situation, for, with every drop of blood that is spilled from Raktabija, he reproduces a clone of himself.  The battlefield becomes increasingly filled with his duplicates.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kinsley p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Durga, in need of help, summons Kāli to combat the demons.  It is said, in some versions, that the Goddess Durga actually assumes the form of Goddess Kāli at this time. Kali destroys Raktabija by sucking the blood from his body and putting the many Raktabija duplicates in her gaping mouth. Pleased with her victory, Kali then dances on the field of battle, stepping on the corpses of the slain. Her consort Shiva lies among the dead beneath her feet, a representation of Kali commonly seen in her iconography as ''Daksinakali''.
* Other warrior goddesses include [[Chamunda]] ("the killer of demon Chanda and Munda") and the goddess group [[Matrikas]] ("Mothers").
*[[Vishpala]] (in ''The [[Rigveda]]'') is a warrior queen who, after having lost a leg in battle had an iron prosthesis made. Afterwards, she returned to fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acpoc.org/library/1976_05_015.asp|title=A Brief Review of the History of Amputations and Prostheses Earl E.

'''''Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13''''' (published in [[paperback]] as '''''Apollo 13'''''), is a non-fiction book first published in 1994 by astronaut [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]] and journalist [[Jeffrey Kluger]], about the failed April 1970 [[Apollo 13]] lunar landing mission which Lovell commanded. The book is the basis of the 1995 film adaptation ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', directed by [[Ron Howard]].

==Background==
Apollo 13 was the third mission of the [[Apollo program]] intended to land men on the Moon. An explosion of an onboard [[liquid oxygen]] tank in the Service Module, when the craft was close to reaching the Moon, crippled the electrical power generation and propulsion systems for the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] ''Odyssey''. This necessitated the abort of the lunar landing, and placed the lives of astronauts Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] in serious jeopardy. The mission became famous for the safe return of the men, made possible by the [[flight controller]]s' resourceful adaptation of the electrical, propulsion, and life support systems of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM (Lunar Module)]] ''Aquarius'' as a "lifeboat".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6726">[[File:Eyck fountain Antwerpen.jpg|thumb|''Madonna at the Fountain'' (1439), oil on panel, 19 x 12 cm (7.5 x 4.75 in). [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp|Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten]], Antwerp.]]
{{Italic title}}
The '''''Madonna at the Fountain'''''&lt;ref&gt;The title is descriptive; the painting was not titled by Jan van Eyck himself. Thus it varies from ''Virgin with Child at a Fountain'' (Harbison) to ''Madonna by the Fountain'' (Snyder), etc. This article uses the title employed by the holding institution, the Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten Antwerp.&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1439 [[panel painting|oil on panel]] painting by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|early Netherlandish]] artist [[Jan van Eyck]]. It belongs to van Eyck's late work, and is his last signed and dated painting. It retains its original frame, which bears the inscription; &lt;small&gt;"ALS IXH CAN", "JOHES DE EYCK ME FECIT + [COM]PLEVIT ANNO 1439&lt;/small&gt;

At 19 x 12&amp;nbsp;cm. the painting is only a little larger than a postcard. It is set in a ''[[hortus conclusus]]'', with the fountain representing the [[fountain of life]].&lt;ref name="Snyder"&gt;Snyder 99&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] is depicted dressed in blue, her figure framed by a richly embroidered [[Baldachin|cloth of honor]] supported by two angels. The Christ Child holds prayer beads in his left hand, suggesting, along with the rose bush behind the figures, the [[rosary]].&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt; In the mid to late 15th century the rosary was becoming increasingly popular in northern Europe.&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt;

This depiction is unusual in that the Madonna wears a blue robe; in the ''[[Dresden Triptych]]'', ''[[Lucca Madonna]]'', and the ''[[Madonna of Chancellor Rolin]]'', van Eyck had depicted her dressed in red. The use of red for the clothes of sacred figures was characteristic of 15th century Netherlandish painting, as [[cochineal]] was among the most expensive pigments available for dying textiles. In contrast to this, Italian painters used [[ultramarine]] for the robes of Madonnas.&lt;ref&gt;Bruns 154-155&lt;/ref&gt; Thus van Eyck's choice of blue can be seen as evidence of Italian influence.

==Byzantine influence==
[[File:Gerard David - Virgin and Child with Four Angels - WGA6036.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Gerard David]], ''[[Virgin and Child with Four Angels (David)|Virgin and Child with Four Angels]]'', c. 1510–15. 63.2 cm × 39.1 cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].]]
With the ''[[Madonna in the Church]]'' in [[Berlin]], this is generally thought to have been one of van Eyck's two paintings of the Madonna and Child from the final years before his death in about 1441.  Both show a standing Virgin, in contrast to his earlier treatments of the subject, and the great majority of other painted Virgins. Models for standing Virgins existed in the icons of [[Byzantine art]], and both paintings also represent modified version of the [[Eleusa icon|''eleusa'' type]], sometimes called the ''Virgin of Tenderness'' in English, where the Virgin and Child touch cheeks, and he reaches out a hand.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison(1991), p.&amp;nbsp;158–162&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Madonna in the Church]]'' wears a blue cloak over a red dress.

During the early 14th and 15th century a large number of these works were imported into the North, and were widely copied by the first generation of Netherlandish artists, among others. The iconography of both the late Byzantine, typified by the unknown artist responsible for the ''[[Cambrai Madonna]]'', and 14th century successors such as [[Giotto]] favoured showing the Madonna in a monumental scale, and it is accepted by art historians that van Eyck absorbed these influences, though when and through which works is disputed. It is believed that he had direct exposure to them during his visit to Italy, which occurred either in 1426 or 1428.  Van Eyck's two panels carried forward the habit of reproduction and were themselves frequently copied by commercial workshops throughout the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;396&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1991), p.&amp;nbsp;159–163&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the Byzantine flavour to these images was also connected with contemporary attempts through diplomacy to achieve reconciliation with the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], in which van Eyck's patron Philip the Good took a keen interest.  Van Eyck's ''[[Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati]]'' (c. 1431) had depicted one of the diplomats most involved with these efforts, acting for the Papacy.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1991), p.&amp;nbsp;163–167&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copies==
The image was much copied, with a very high-quality copy assigned to van Eyck's workshop just after the original (Private collection, [[Maastricht]]).&lt;ref&gt;Evans, no. 353&lt;/ref&gt; There is a workshop drawing of the central figures by [[Gerard David]] of about 1500-1510 in the [[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin]], presumably used for [[Virgin and Child with Four Angels (David)|his version of the figures]], now with four angels and a panoramic landscape background of [[Bruges]], now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.  This was planned as a precise copy, but the new elements were added while the work was in progress, as modern scientific analysis of the underdrawing shows.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, nos. 354 and 355&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Saivism}}
The '''Pashupati Seal''' is a [[steatite]] [[Impression seal|seal]] that was discovered at the [[Mohenjo-daro]] archaeological site of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. The seal depicts a seated figure that is possibly [[Three-headed|tricephalic]] (having three heads). It was once thought to be [[ithyphallic]], an interpretation that is now mostly discarded. He has a horned headdress and is surrounded by animals. He may represent a [[horned deity]].

It is purported to be one of the earliest depictions of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Shiva]] ("[[Pashupati]]", meaning "lord of animals", is one of Shiva's [[Epithet|epithets]]) or [[Rudra]], who is associated with asceticism, [[yoga]], and [[linga]]; regarded as a lord of animals; and often depicted as having three heads.  The figure has often been connected with the widespread motif of the [[Master of Animals]] found in ancient [[Near East]]ern and Mediterranean art, and the many other traditions of horned deities.&lt;ref&gt;Werness, Hope B., ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Animal Symbolism in World Art'', p. 270, 2006, A&amp;C Black, {{ISBN|0826419135}}, 9780826419132, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iBSDddO-9PoC&amp;pg=PA270 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and description==
[[File:Mohenjo-daro.jpg|thumb|A view of the Mohenjo-daro excavation site. The DK-G Area where the seal was found lies north-east of the [[Great Bath]] seen in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kenoyer|first=Jonathan Mark|title=Mohenjo-daro: Introduction|url=http://www.mohenjodaro.net/mohenjodarointroduction.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201085754/http://www.mohenjodaro.net/mohenjodarointroduction.html|archivedate=2013-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The seal was uncovered in 1928-29, in Block 1, Southern Portion of the DK-G Area of Mohenjo-daro, at a depth of 3.9 meters below the surface.{{sfn|Mackay|1928-29|pp=74-75}} [[Ernest J. H. Mackay|E.J.H. Mackay]], who directed the excavations at Mohenjo-daro, and dated the seal to the Intermediate I Period (now considered to fall around 2350-2000 BCE) in his 1937-38 report in which the seal is numbered 420, giving it its alternate name.{{sfn|Mackay|1937-38|loc=plate XCIV; no. 420}}

[[File:Yogi. Mold of Seal, Indus valley civilization.jpg|thumb|An impression made from the steatite seal]]
The seal is formed of [[steatite]] and measures 3.56&amp;nbsp;cm by 3.53&amp;nbsp;cm, with a thickness of 0.76&amp;nbsp;cm. It has a human figure at the center seated on a platform and facing forward. The legs of the figure are bent at the knees with the heels touching and the toes pointing downwards. The arms extend outwards and rest lightly on the knees, with the thumbs facing away from the body. Eight small and three large bangles cover the arms. The chest is covered with what appear to be necklaces, and a double band wraps around the waist. The figure wears a tall and elaborate headdress with central fan-shaped structure flanked by two large striated horns. The human figure is surrounded by four wild animals: an elephant and a tiger to its one side, and a water buffalo and a rhinoceros on the other. Under the dais are two deer or ibexes looking backwards, so that their horns almost meet the center. At the top of the seal are seven [[Indus script|pictographs]], with the last apparently displaced downwards for lack of horizontal space.{{sfn|Possehl|2002|p=141}}{{sfn|Marshall|1931|p=52}}

==Identification with proto-Shiva==

===Marshall's analysis===
An early description and analysis of the seal's iconography was provided by archaeologist [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]] who had served as the Director-General of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] and led the excavations of the Indus Valley sites. In addition to the general features of the seal described above, he also saw the central figure as a male deity; as three-faced, with a possible fourth face towards the back; and, as [[ithyphallic]], while conceding that what appeared to be the exposed phallus could instead be a tassel hanging from the waistband. Most significantly he identified the seal as an early prototype of the [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]] (or, his Vedic predecessor, [[Rudra]]), who also was known by the title [[Pashupati]] ('lord or father of all the animals') in historic times.{{sfn|Marshall|1931|pp=52-57}} In a 1928&amp;ndash;29 publication, Marshall summarized his reasons for the identification as follows:
{{quote|My reasons for the identification are four. In the first place the figure has three faces and that Siva was portrayed with three as well as with more usual five faces, there are abundant examples to prove. Secondly, the head is crowned with the horns of a bull and the ''[[trishul (weapon)|trisula]]'' are characteristic emblems of Siva. Thirdly, the figure is in a typical yoga attitude, and Siva was and still is, regarded as a ''mahayogi''&amp;mdash;the prince of ''[[Yogi]]s''. Fourthly, he is surrounded by animals, and Siva is par excellence the "Lord of Animals" (''Pasupati'')&amp;mdash;of the wild animals of the jungle, according to the Vedic meaning of the word ''pashu'', no less than that of domesticated cattle.{{sfn|Mackay|1928-29|pp=74-75}}}}
Later, in 1931, he expanded his reasons to include the fact that Shiva is associated with the phallus in the form of ''[[linga]]'', and that in medieval art he is shown with deer or ibexes, as are seen below the throne on the seal.{{sfn|Marshall|1931|pp=52-57}}{{sfn|McEvilley|pp=45-46}} Marshall's analysis of the Indus Valley religion, and the Pashupati seal in particular, was very influential and widely accepted for at least the next two generations. For instance, Herbert Sullivan, wrote in 1964 that Marshall's analysis "has been accepted almost universally and has greatly influenced scholarly understanding of the historical development of Hinduism".{{sfn|Sullivan|1964}} Writing in 1976, [[Doris Meth Srinivasan|Doris Srinivasan]] introduced an article otherwise critical of Marshall's interpretation by observing that "no matter what position is taken regarding the seal's iconography, it is always prefaced by Marshall's interpretation. On balance the proto-{{IAST|Śiva}} character of the seal has been accepted."{{sfn|Srinivasan|1975-76|p=47}} And [[Alf Hiltebeitel]] noted that, following Marshall's analysis, "nearly all efforts at interpreting the [Indus Valley] religion have centered discussion around [the Pashupati seal] figure".{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2011|p=399}}

===Objections and alternate interpretations===
A lot of discussion has taken place about this seal.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Edwin, p.163"&gt;Bryant, Edwin, p.163&lt;/ref&gt; While Marshall's work has earned some support, many critics and even supporters have raised several objections.&lt;ref&gt;See e. g. James G. Lochtefeld, ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', vol. 2: N–Z. The Rosen Publishing Group, New York 2002, p. 633, who doubts the connection of the seal to Shiva, given the supposedly late age of the god.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Doris Meth Srinivasan|Doris Srinivasan]] has argued that the figure does not have three faces, or yogic posture, and that in [[Vedas|Vedic literature]]  Rudra was not a protector of wild animals.{{sfn|Srinivasan|1975-76}}{{sfn|Srinivasan|1997|p=180-181}} Herbert Sullivan and Alf Hiltebeitel also rejected Marshall's conclusions, with the former claiming that the figure was female, while the latter associated the figure with ''Mahisha'', the Buffalo God and the surrounding animals with [[vahana]]s (vehicles, mounts) of deities for the four cardinal directions.{{sfn|Sullivan|1964}}{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2011|pp=399-432}} However, Mahisha strikingly resembles Mahesha, an epithet of Shiva Pashupati, besides recalling his vehicle, or vahana Nandi, the bull. This seems to provide further evidence for the interpretation of the Pashupati seal as a proto-Shiva archetype.&lt;ref&gt;Chitgopekar, Nilima. ''Book of Durga.''  Penguin Books India, [2009] p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Various interpretations have been connected to the seal, some relating it to the  Vedic deities: [[Rudra]], [[Agni]], Mahisha, [[Varuna]], Yogi, Yogi with Trident as head dress, [[Rishyasringa|Ŗșyaśŗnga]] (sage with horns) who is a contemporary of Dasarataand{{fact|date=June 2017}}; and  some non-aryan deities, including the unlikely Dravidian origin, sitting in yoga posture.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Edwin, p.163"/&gt;

===Current opinion===
Writing in 2002, [[Gregory L. Possehl]] concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognize the figure as a deity, its association with the water buffalo, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-Shiva would "go too far."{{sfn|Possehl|2002|pp=141-144}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4659">'''''Postminimalism''''' is an art term coined (as '''''post-minimalism''''') by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] in 1971&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Chilvers, Ian and Glaves-Smith, John, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art'', second edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 569. {{ISBN|0199239665}}.&lt;/ref&gt; used in various artistic fields for work which is influenced by, or attempts to develop and go beyond, the aesthetic of [[minimalism]]. The expression is used specifically in relation to music and the visual arts, but can refer to any field using minimalism as a critical reference point.  
In music, ''postminimalism'' refers to music following [[minimal music]].

==Visual art==
{{See also|List of postminimalist artists}}
In visual art, postminimalist art uses minimalism either as an aesthetic or conceptual reference point. Postminimalism is more an artistic tendency than a particular movement.  Postminimalist artworks are usually everyday objects, use simple materials, and sometimes take on a "pure", [[Formalism (art)|formalist]] aesthetic. However, since postminimalism includes such a diverse and disparate group of artists, it is impossible to enumerate all the continuities and similarities between them.

The work of [[Eva Hesse]] is also postminimalist: it uses "grids" and "seriality", themes often found in minimalism, but is also usually hand-made, introducing a human element into her art, in contrast to the machine or custom-made works of minimalism. [[Richard Serra]] is a prominent post-minimalist.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Roberta (April 14, 2011). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/arts/design/richard-serras-drawings-at-metropolitan-museum-of-art.html?pagewanted=all Richard Serra's Drawings at Metropolitan Museum of Art]", ''NYTimes.com''. Accessed 8 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|List of postminimalist composers}} 
In its general musical usage, ''postminimalism'' refers to works influenced by [[minimal music]], and it is generally categorized within the meta-genre [[art music]]. Writer [[Kyle Gann]]&lt;ref name="Gann2001"&gt;Kyle Gann. 2001. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110604040811/http://www.newmusicbox.org/article.nmbx?id=1536 Minimal Music, Maximal Impact: Minimalism's Immediate Legacy: Postminimalism]". ''New Music Box: The Web Magazine from the American Music Center'' (November 1) (Accessed 4 February 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; has employed the term more strictly to denote the style that flourished in the 1980s and 1990s and characterized by: 
#a steady [[pulse (music)|pulse]], usually continuing throughout a work or movement; 
#a [[diatonic scale|diatonic]] pitch language, [[tonality|tonal]] in effect but avoiding traditional [[diatonic function|functional tonality]]; 
#general evenness of [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], without strong climaxes or nuanced emotionalism; and 
#unlike [[minimalism]], an avoidance of obvious or linear formal design.

Minimalist procedures such as [[additive rhythm and divisive rhythm|additive]] and subtractive [[process music|process]] are common in postminimalism, though usually in disguised form, and the style has also shown a capacity for absorbing influences from world and popular music ([[Balinese gamelan]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], Jewish [[cantillation]], and so on). 

For a musical style derived from minimalism, see [[Totalism (music)]].

== History ==
[[Edgar Lee Hewett]], a professor of archaeology and the director of the Laboratory of Anthropology in Santa Fe, was working closely with locals from the San Ildefonso pueblo on excavations. He said that he "discovered" their ability to draw and paint in watercolor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Modern West: American Landscapes, 1890-1950|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3DNuRni76kC|publisher = Yale University Press|date = 2006-01-01|isbn = 0300114486|first = Emily Ballew|last = Neff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hewett encouraged the production of art work from Native American artists and helped gain them financial support of white patrons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The artwork is often composed of the subject matter, Native American ways of life. The work uses flat and using bright colors. It was celebrated as an American way of contemporary abstraction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Artists who tried to veer way from that style were discouraged by their patrons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Critics ===
During the early 20th century, numerous white Americans became involved in an effort to promote Native American arts within white social circles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Critiques of the San Ildefonso Self-Taught Group have been made by those who study "traditional" Native American art, versus art of Native Americans supported (and perhaps shaped by) white patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tonita Peña (Quah Ah), Pueblo Painter: Asserting Identity through Continuity and Change on JSTOR|jstor = 1184742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism''' ({{lang-da|Skandinavisk institut for sammenlignende vandalisme}}) is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] cultural [[institute]] based in [[Denmark]].

It was founded in 1961 by the [[Denmark|Danish]] artist [[Asger Jorn]], [[Peter Glob]] and [[Werner Jacobsen]] from the [[National Museum of Denmark]] and [[Holger Arbman]] of the [[University of Lund]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name = Henriksen&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jorn had recently left the [[Situationist International]], although he continued to support them financially. The stated purpose of the institute was to throw new light upon the Scandinavian culture in the age of migrations and Vikings. For several years, Jorn toured around Scandinavia and Europe with photographer Gérard Franceschi, former photographer for French writer and onetime culture minister [[André Malraux]] on his ''Musée imaginaire'' project, photographing ancient, [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]], Scandinavian, and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] figurative and decorative motifs in order to trace the connections between Scandinavian and European motifs. [[Jacqueline de Jong]] was also involved in several of these excursions.

In 1965, the [[Silkeborg]] municipal government provided a building to store over 20,000 photographs taken by Jorn, [[Gerard Franceschi]] and [[Ulrik Ross]].&lt;ref name = Henriksen/&gt; Jorn was working with the publisher Skandinavisk Forlag in Odense to publish a series of books based on his research and documentation called ''10,000 Years of Nordic Folk Art'' (''10 000 års nordisk folkekunst''). Jorn gave up the project that year, however, when the press Skandinavisk Forlag refused to proceed unless the project was run by a committee of scholars, with Jorn having only one vote. He wanted total control of the subject of each volume.&lt;ref&gt;Anneli Fuchs, "Roots and Perspective: Asger Jorn and Tradition in Art," in ''Asger Jorn'' (Ishøj: [[Arken Museum of Modern Art]], 2002), 107&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute remained as a sort of imaginary museum, now housed in the [[Silkeborg Kunstmuseum]], home of Jorn's art collection and archives. Jorn continued to publish articles and books on the subject of Nordic art as a tradition independent of what he called the "Classical-Latin" tradition.

A publication series of theoretical texts (without illustration) in the name of the institute (''Meddelelse fra Skandinavisk institut for sammenlignende vandalisme'') encompasses four books, all by Jorn
* ''Naturens Orden'' (1962)
* ''Værdi og økonomi'' (1962)
* ''Held og Hasard''  (1963)
* ''Alfa og Omega'' (1980 posthumous)

[[File:Airbus A380 cockpit.jpg|thumb|[[Airbus A380]] flight deck showing side-sticks]]
[[File:F16 ohjaamo.jpg|thumb|F-16 cockpit showing side-stick]]
A '''side-stick''' or '''sidestick controller''' is an [[aircraft]] control column (or [[joystick]]) that is located on the side console of the [[Aviator|pilot]], usually on the righthand side, or outboard on a two-seat [[Cockpit (aviation)|flightdeck]]. Typically this is found in aircraft that are equipped with [[fly-by-wire]] control systems.&lt;ref name="Crane"&gt;Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition'', page 463. Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, 1997. {{ISBN|1-56027-287-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The throttle controls are typically located to the left of the pilot (or centrally on a two-seat flightdeck). Only one hand may thus be used for the stick, and both-hands operation is neither possible nor required.

The side-stick is used in many modern military [[fighter aircraft]], such as the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]], [[Mitsubishi F-2]], [[Dassault Rafale]], and [[F-22 Raptor]], and also on civil aircraft, such as the [[Sukhoi Superjet 100]], [[Airbus A320]] and later [[Airbus]] aircraft,&lt;ref name=fbw_sidestick&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the largest passenger jet in service, the [[Airbus A380]].

This arrangement contrasts with the more conventional design where the stick is located in the centre of the cockpit between the pilot's legs, called a "[[centre stick]]".

In the centre stick design, both the pilot's and co-pilot's controls are mechanically connected together so each pilot has a sense of the control inputs of the other. In typical Airbus side-stick implementations, the sticks are independent. The plane's computer either aggregates multiple inputs or a pilot can press a "priority button" to lock out inputs from the other side-stick.&lt;ref name=getline&gt;{{Citation

The '''Stenborg theatre''', also called '''Svenska Komiska Teatern''', '''Komiska Teatern''' and '''Munkbroteatern''', was a historical Swedish 18th century theatre, active between 1784 and 1799 in [[Gamla stan]] in [[Stockholm]]. It was the second theatre of Stockholm during the Gustavian age. In 1784-87, before the inauguration of the theatre of Ristell in [[Bollhuset]], it was the only dramatic theatre of the native language in Stockholm.   

== History ==

===Background===
The Stenborg theatre was a continuation of the famous [[Stenborg Troupe]]; when the first Swedish national theatre at [[Bollhuset]] was closed in 1753–54, half of the troupe performed in various localities in the city under the leadership of [[Petter Stenborg]]. When the national stage was re-established by king [[Gustav III of Sweden]] in 1773, it did not include the old Stenborg troupe. In 1780, the troupe had finally acquired a proper house to perform in; Eriksbergsteatern, (The Eriksberg Theatre), and in 1781, the leadership was taken over by Petter Stenborg son, Carl Stenborg. In 1780–84, the Eriksberg Theatre was the only permanent theatre on the native language in Stockholm.        

The Erikberg Theatre was uncomfortably outside of town, and the Stenborg troupe under Carl Stenborg searched for a new building. They made a partnership with the rich brewer [[Christina Nyman]], who wanted to establish a theatre in Gamla stan and had obtained a permission to do so. The theatre was housed in a large building erected in Gamla Stan in 1782; the first floor housed four taverns and several apartments, while the second floor was reserved for the Stenborg troupe. From 1784, it was formally named ''Svenska komiska Teatern'' (Swedish Comical Theatre) or ''Svenska Teatern'' (Swedish Theatre) and from 1788 ''Komiska Teatern'' (Comedy Theatre). It was also known as ''Munkbroteatern'' (The Munkbro Theatre), after its location. The common name for it was always the Stenborg Theatre. 

===Activity===
The theatre was luxuriously decorated and was in 1784 called the biggest theatre in the country. The theatrically interested king was present at its premier and gave away gifts to its performers. However, it did not have the same status as the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] and [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] and was considered much less formal: it was a place for less formal and solemn performances, a place for satirical comedy and such, and foreigners sometimes compared it to a boulevard-theatre of the kind that was popular in [[Paris]].    I also performed less formal opera and musicals. ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' had its Swedish premiere here in 1785, as well as ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' in 1792.    Also foreign guest-artists and [[circus]]-performances were given here; in the autumn of 1793, the English circus-company of Peter and James Price performed acrobatics and tight-rope-dancing here, were the four-year-old Louise Price danced on a rope. The theater's status as a less serious theatre did not stop actors from the Royal Swedish Opera and the Royal Dramatic Theatre to appear there; even [[Elisabeth Olin]] had performed here, and it was in fact used by actors and singers to work in during their conflicts with the managements with their regular stages.   

The director Carl Stenborg, who was a celebrated [[opera singer]] at the Royal Swedish Opera, resided in one of the apartments, where he and his wife, the singer Betty Olin, hosted gatherings and parties for the cultural elite of the city. The theatre often took their staff from the choir at the Royal Opera, but it also took in its own students. An advertisement in 1786 read as follows: 
:"If some common parents, who own children of a beautiful appearance and a good voice, would like to have them educated, for their own benefit, in a talent which may be beneficial to their future, they may have an education and a reward answering to their ability, when they enlist at the royal secretary Stenborg at the New Swedish theatre house at Munkbron".&lt;ref&gt;Johan Flodmark : Stenborgska skådebanorna (The Stenborg Stages) {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closure===
In 1798, the new monopoly of the royal theaters was proclaimed in the city of Stockholm, and the Stenborg theatre was closed the year after (the monopoly was in effect until 1842). The building itself was torn down in 1899.

Hava is a young girl who, on her ninth birthday, is told by her mother and grandmother that she has become a woman with particular responsibilities. She may no longer play with her best friend, a boy, and must wear a [[chador]] when outside the home. Hava is given the choice when to start taking on those responsibilities—noon that day. A stick pushed into the ground will mark time as the shadow at noon will align with the stick.&lt;ref name="OS"&gt;{{cite web

Ahoo is a married woman who is taking part in a [[cycling]] race. Ahead of the rest, Ahoo is pursued by her husband on horseback. He tries to persuade her to stop cycling and come home, and then threatens her with [[divorce]]. When Ahoo defiantly continues cycling, her husband brings a [[mullah]] who divorces them. Later, tribal superiors and male family members come to stop Ahoo as she tries to escape the social constraints of being a woman.&lt;ref name="OS" /&gt;

Hoora is an elderly widow who has recently inherited a great deal of money. She decides to buy all of the material possessions she has ever wanted, but could not have while she was married. She ties strings to her fingers to remind her what to buy, and hires several young boys to help her. They take her and her new belongings to the beach. As she floats out to a waiting ship, seemingly free from the bonds of womanhood, she is watched by two of the young women from the bicycle race, and Hava, now wearing her chador.&lt;ref name="OS" /&gt;

'''''The Mask You Live In''''' is a 2015 documentary film written, directed, and produced by [[Jennifer Siebel Newsom]]. It premiered at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival]]. The film explores what Newsom perceives to be harmful notions about [[masculinity]] in Western culture.

==Background==
Newsom's inspiration for making the film came from becoming pregnant with her son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lang|first1=Brent|title=Sundance:'The Mask You Live In' Examines America’s Boy Crisis|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/sundance-the-mask-you-live-in-examines-americas-boy-crisis-1201412965/|accessdate=January 30, 2015|date=January 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview she said, "It was really important to me that I could nurture a son who could be true to his authentic self, who wouldn't always feel like he had to prove his masculinity. There's so much loneliness, pain, and suffering when one is pretending to be someone that they're not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mechanic|first1=Michael|title="Be a Man."

==Reception==
The film was received slightly positively by critics and currently holds a 60% on Rotten Tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Mask You Live In|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_mask_you_live_in_2015/|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collider (website)|Collider]]'s Matt Goldberg recommended that the film be required viewing in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldberg|first1=Matt|title=The Mask You Live In Review |url=http://collider.com/the-mask-you-live-in-review/|publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sublime Object of Ideology''''' is a 1989 book by [[Slovenia]]n [[philosopher]] and [[cultural]] [[theorist]] [[Slavoj Žižek]]. The work is widely considered his masterpiece.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1446643/Slavoj-Zizek/301049/The-Sublime-Object-of-Ideology|title=The Sublime Object of Ideology|last=[[Ian Parker (psychologist)]]|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Žižek thematizes the [[Kantian]] notion of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] in order to liken [[ideology]] to the experience of something that is absolutely vast and powerful beyond all perception and objective intelligibility. Žižek provides an analysis of "How did Marx Invent the Symptom?", in which he compares the ways in which the notion of symptom runs through the work of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Sigmund Freud]].  Žižek opposes any simplistic reading of the two thinkers, who are shown to have discovered the "[[wikt:kernel|kernel]]" of meaning concealed within the apparently unconnected "forms" of [[commodity|commodities]] (Marx) and [[dream]]s (Freud).  The kernel of a commodity's content is labour and its latent meaning is the dream. Žižek thinks it more important to ask why latent content takes a particular form.  Žižek therefore argues that according to both Freud and Marx the dream-work and commodity-form itself require analysis.

==Reception==
Žižek believes ''The Sublime Object of Ideology'' to be one of his best books,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=aussiesta|title=Slavoj Zizek Picks His Best Three Books|date=2016-11-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqUW2uScLio&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=25s|accessdate=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; while psychologist [[Ian Parker (psychologist)|Ian Parker]] writes in the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' that it is "widely considered his masterpiece".&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1446643/Slavoj-Zizek/301049/The-Sublime-Object-of-Ideology|title=The Sublime Object of Ideology|last=[[Ian Parker (psychologist)]]|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Elliott writes that the work is "a provocative reconstruction of critical theory from Marx to Althusser, reinterpreted through the frame of Lacanian psychoanalysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Elliott, Anthony |title=Psychoanalytic Theory: An Introduction |year=2002 |publisher=Palgrave |page=117 |isbn=0-333-91912-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''turnaround''' or '''turnaround deal''' is an arrangement in the [[film industry]] whereby the production costs of a project which one [[film studio|studio]] has developed are declared a loss on the company's tax return, thereby preventing the studio from exploiting the property any further. The rights can then be sold to another studio in exchange for the cost of development plus interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Murky Side of Movie Rights |author=Michael Cieply |date=2008-08-23 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/business/media/24steal.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Cieply defined the term in ''The New York Times'' as "arrangements under which producers can move a project from one studio to another under certain conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Studio War Involving ‘Watchmen’ Heats Up |author=Michael Cieply |date=2008-08-29 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/30/movies/30watc.html |accessdate=2008-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*The turnaround of ''[[The Boondock Saints]]'' is documented in ''[[Overnight]]'', a 2003 documentary which mainly focuses on the perspective of how director [[Troy Duffy]] "fell" in Hollywood.
*The 1993 film ''My Life's in Turnaround'', starring [[Martha Plimpton]] and [[Phoebe Cates]], tells the story of two friends who attempt to sell the story of their lives to a variety of studios.
*The 2012 film ''[[Argo (2012 film)|Argo]]'' uses several references to the film that was faked for the [[Canadian Caper|1980 CIA Iranian hostage extraction operation]] also titled ''Argo'' as being "in turnaround".&lt;ref&gt;David Edelstein interviewed by Terri Gross on review of Argo: (2012-10-12) https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=162785168&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Two Girls in the Snow''''' is an 1894 oil on canvas painting by the Dutch artist [[Isaac Israels]]. It was bought from the artist in 1904 for the private Drake-Fraser collection in London, which lent it to the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam in 1917. It was then bought by the museum in 1944.

[[File:St Saviour's House, Union Street - geograph.org.uk - 920369.jpg|thumb|St Saviour's House]]

'''Union Street''' is a major street in the [[London Borough of Southwark]]. It runs between [[Blackfriars Road]] to the west and [[Borough High Street]] to the east.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-se1.co.uk/street/union-street Union Street], London SE1 community website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londontown.com/LondonStreets/union_street_9be.html London guide to Union Street, SE1], LondonTown.com.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Southwark Bridge Road]] crosses in the middle.

== History ==
The eastern part of the street was laid out under a 1774 Act passed for making a new workhouse and for "making a carriage way from the … High Street, through the Greyhound Inn, into Queen Street, and for improving the passage from thence into Gravel Lane, leading towards the Black Friars Bridge Road, in the parish of Christ Church."&lt;ref&gt;Sir Howard Roberts and Walter H. Godfrey (editors), [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=65324 Union Street], ''Survey of London: volume 22: Bankside (the parishes of St. Saviour and Christchurch Southwark)'', Chapter 12, pages 84–86, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1782 the Union Hall was opened as the Surrey Magistrates Court in the borough, the JPs having previously sat at the Town Hall in the High Street. The façade of the Hall was retained on the new structure on the site in 2005.

In 1813, Queen Street and Duke Street were renamed Union Street. In 1908 Charlotte Street, at the western end of Union Street, was also renamed to be part of the street yet it clearly has a dislocated junction with it, exacerbated by it starting under the railway viaduct.

A fire at an oil and paint shop in Union Street in April 1885 resulted in the death of [[Alice Ayres]], whose bravery in saving her three nieces captured the public imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alice Ayres - A Secular Saint|url=http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2013/03/alice_ayres_a_secular_saint.html|publisher=St Margarets Community Website|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red Cross Burial Ground was a burial ground at the northeast corner of Union Street and Red Cross Way.

The street was called Union Street because it marks the boundary between the two local parishes in the area.

==Amenities==
The [[Union Theatre (London)|Union Theatre]] is a leading fringe venue on the north side of the street. On the south side is [[Jerwood Space]], an arts venue, located in the former Orange Street School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerwoodspace.co.uk/ Jerwood Space].&lt;/ref&gt; Other art galleries include the [[RKB Gallery]], dedicated to artworks on paper,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rkburt.com/gallery/ RKB Gallery], R. K. Burt UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-se1.co.uk/places/rkb-gallery RKB Gallery], London SE1 community website.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Union Gallery]], a contemporary art gallery under the railway arches on the north side, that moved to Teesdale Road in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-se1.co.uk/places/union-gallery Union Gallery], London SE1 community website&lt;/ref&gt;

Public houses on the street include the Charles Dickens and the Lord Nelson, named after two famous Englishmen. Dickens lodged in [[Lant Street]] not far away as a child.

==Transport==
[[Southwark tube station|Southwark Underground station]] is at the western end. [[Southwark Street]] runs in parallel to the north. The road forms part of the B300, linking with [[The Cut (London)|The Cut]] to the west. To the east is Newcomen Street.

'''Yolanda García Serrano''' (born 1958) is a Spanish film director and writer, the winner of the 1994 [[Goya Award for Best Original Screenplay]] for the film ''[[All Men Are the Same]]''.&lt;ref name=Goya&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://elpais.com/diario/1997/04/09/madrid/860585079_850215.html |title='En Madrid surgen historias por todas partes' |trans-title='In Madrid, Stories Emerge Everywhere' |first=Dolores |last=Conquero |work=[[El País]] |location=Madrid |language=Spanish |date=9 April 1997 |access-date=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
García studied Public Relations and worked for a few years as a secretary while starting her studies in Dramatic Arts.&lt;ref name=Sofia&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://arbor.revistas.csic.es/index.php/arbor/article/view/794/801 |title=Sofia entre mujeres |trans-title=Sofia Between Women |work=Arbor |volume=185 |number=A1 |language=Spanish |date=2009 |access-date=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She immediately began to participate in a theater group and to write small works, first for the children's audience and then for adults. She studied dramatic writing with {{ill|Fermín Cabal|es}}, [[José Luis Alonso de Santos]], and {{ill|Jesús Campos García|es|lt=Jesús Campos}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpwlYIqjE78C&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;pg=PA196 |title=Miradas a la escena de fin de siglo: Escritos dispersos II |trans-title=Looking at the Scene at the End of the Century: Dispersed Writings II |chapter=La dramaturgia española actual (1975–2000) |trans-chapter=Current Spanish Dramaturgy (1975–2000) |first=Guillermo |last=Heras |publisher=[[University of Valencia]] |isbn=9788437054292 |page=196 |language=Spanish |year=2002 |access-date=27 August 2018 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later studied audiovisual and cinematographic narrative, as well as film direction. She then began writing for film, television, and theater.

In 1986, and within a dramaturgy workshop of the National Center of New Trends, her play ''La llamada es del todo inadecuada'' was selected along with two others to be performed at the [[Círculo de Bellas Artes]] in Madrid. It was a completely new project in Spanish drama with a work framed in the theater of the absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://elpais.com/diario/1986/01/04/cultura/505177205_850215.html |title=El misterio de la dramaturgia |trans-title=The Mystery of Dramaturgy |first=Eduardo |last=Haro Tecglen |work=[[El País]] |language=Spanish |date=4 January 1986 |access-date=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began working in cinematic screenwriting with [[Joaquín Oristrell]], {{ill|Lola Salvador Maldonado|es|lt=Lola Salvador}}, and {{ill|Manolo Matji|es}}, but despite having gone through specialized schools with American and Hispanic writers, García confesses that she learned the trade by writing, reading, going a lot to the movies, "and throwing many scripts to the basket." Later she also went on to teach at the [[Community of Madrid]]'s Cinematography and Audiovisual School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://elpais.com/diario/1998/03/24/sociedad/890694033_850215.html |title=García Serrano: 'Aprendí tirando guiones al cesto' |trans-title=García Serrano: 'I Learned Throwing Scripts to the Basket' |first=Susana |last=Pérez de Pablos |work=[[El País]] |location=Madrid |language=Spanish |date=24 March 1998 |access-date=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, she began her career as a professional screenwriter with works for film, television programs, and series. From the beginning she formed a team working in collaboration with [[Manuel Gómez Pereira]], {{ill|Juan Luis Iborra|es}}, and Joaquín Oristrell. In 1994, and in collaboration with them, she won the [[Goya Award for Best Original Screenplay]] for ''[[All Men Are the Same]]''.&lt;ref name=Goya/&gt; Among the series she has written for are ''[[Farmacia de guardia]]'' (1991–1995), ''{{ill|Abuela de verano|es}}'' (2005), ''Clara Campoamor'', and ''{{ill|Fugitiva|es}}'' (2018).&lt;ref name=Fugitiva&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rtve.es/television/20170720/paz-vega-protagonizara-fugitiva-nueva-serie-rtve-empezara-rodarse-noviembre/1584521.shtml |title=Paz Vega protagonizará 'Fugitiva', la nueva serie de RTVE que empezará a rodarse en noviembre |trans-title=Paz Vega Will Star in 'Fugitiva', the New RTVE Series That Will Begin Shooting in November |publisher=[[RTVE]] |language=Spanish |date=20 July 2017 |access-date=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In movies, she wrote ''[[Why Do They Call It Love When They Mean Sex?]]'' (1993), ''[[Love Can Seriously Damage Your Health]]'' (1997), ''[[Queens (film)|Queens]]'' (2005), and ''[[Mediterranean Food]]'' (2008). 

In 1997, García directed and wrote the screenplay for ''[[Amor de hombre]]'' with Juan Luis Iborra, which she later turned into a novel. The film won the 1st Award for the best film of the L.A.
