'''Abnormal behavior   of birds in captivity''' can be defined in several ways.  [[Abnormality (behavior)|Statistically]], 'abnormal' is when the occurrence, frequency or intensity of a behaviour varies [[statistically significant]]ly, either more or less, from the normal value.  This means that theoretically, almost any behaviour could become 'abnormal' in an individual.  Less formally, 'abnormal' includes any activity judged to be outside the normal behaviour pattern for captive [[birds]] of that particular class or age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/abnormal+behavior|title=abnormal behaviour|accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, running rather than flying may be a normal behaviour and regularly observed in one species, however, in another species it might be normal but becomes 'abnormal' if it reaches a high frequency, or in another species it is rarely observed and any incidence is considered 'abnormal'.  This article does not include 'one-off' behaviours performed by individual birds that might be considered abnormal for that individual, unless these are performed repeatedly by other individuals in the species and are recognised as part of the [[ethogram]] of that species.

Most abnormal behaviours can be categorised collectively (e.g., eliminative, ingestive, stereotypies), however, many abnormal behaviours fall debatebly into several of these categories and categorisation is therefore not attempted in this article.  Abnormal behaviours here are considered to be related to captive housing but may also be due to medical conditions.  The article does not include behaviours in birds that are genetically modified to express abnormal behaviour.


When housed under captive or commercial conditions, birds often show a range of abnormal behaviours. These are often self-injurious or harmful to other individuals, and include:

&lt;br /&gt;When analyzing the behaviour of birds in captivity, what is considered normal or abnormal behaviour is dependent on the form and frequency that the particular behaviour is expressed in the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;Wiepkema, P.R. (1985). Abnormal behavior in farm animals: ethological implications. Netherlands Journal of Zoology, 35, 279-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Birds raised in pet stores tend to be raised with other birds, however, after being sold and taken to the owner's home, birds in captivity are often housed in isolation and in environments lacking abundant resources or complex stimuli. In the United States, it is estimated that forty million birds are kept caged and improperly cared for.&lt;ref&gt;“There is no such thing as a cage bird”. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. &lt;http://www.peta.org/issues/companion-animals/caging-birds.aspx&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these inappropriate housing conditions, abnormal behaviour patterns may appear in [[birdcage|caged birds]] kept as pets. Once established, these abnormal behaviours in birds are often not alterable.&lt;ref&gt;Ten Cate, C. (1995). Behavioral development in birds and the implications of imprinting and song learning for captive propagation. Research and Captive Propagation, 187-197.&lt;/ref&gt;

When social interactions amongst birds are absent or inadequate, abnormal social behaviour may develop. For example, a study regarding [[parrot]]s that had been isolated in cages demonstrated that most birds showing this [[social deprivation]] had significant behavioural disturbances, such as aggressive behaviour, [[feather-plucking|feather picking]], [[self-harm|self-mutilation]], restlessness, screaming, apathetic behavior, and [[stereotypy|stereotypies]].&lt;ref name="Lantermann, W. 1993"&gt;Lantermann, W. (1993). Social deprivation in Amazon parrots. Animal Behaviour, 38, 511-520.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cannibalism often occurs in large [[animal husbandry]] systems, which are usually impoverished environments with a lack of opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, B.O. &amp; Duncan, I.J.H. (1998). The notion of ethological “need,” models of motivation and animal welfare. Animal Behaviour, 36, 1696-1707.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, studies of caged canaries have revealed two common stereotypies.&lt;ref name="Sargent" /&gt; These include spot picking, where birds repeatedly touch a particular spot in the environment with the tip of their beak, and route tracing, a pacing behaviour associated with physical restrictions in movement imposed by the cage. The absence of [[bird vocalization|song learning]] in [[zebra finch]]es has also been implicated as a behavioural abnormality.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, P.J, B., Jones, A. &amp; Ten Cate, C. (1993). Can lack of experience delay the end of the  sensitive phase for song learning? Netherlands Journal of Zoology, 43, 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt; In these birds, the social interaction of a young male with his song tutor is important for normal song development. Without the stimulus, the song, which is necessary for mating behavior, will not be learned. 

Researchers have analyzed ways to alleviate some abnormal behaviours in caged birds. Presenting these birds with novel stimuli e.g. a mirror or plastic birds, and social stimuli, such as a brief view of a bird in another cage, significantly reduced stereotypies.&lt;ref&gt;Keiper, R.R. (1970). Studies of stereotypy function in the canary (Serinus canarius). Animal Behaviour, 18, 353-357.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has been suggested that keeping caged birds in pairs or small groups may reduce the development of abnormal behaviours, however, little quantitative evidence has thus far been collected to support this claim.&lt;ref name="Lantermann, W. 1993"/&gt;

An '''adaptive system''' is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole that together are able to respond to environmental changes or changes in the interacting parts, in a way analogous to either continuous physiological [[homeostasis]] or evolutionary [[adaptation]] in [[biology]]. [[Feedback loops]] represent a key feature of adaptive systems, such as [[ecosystems]] and individual [[organisms]]; or in the human world, [[communities]], [[organizations]], and [[families]].

Artificial adaptive systems include [[robots]] with [[control system]]s that utilize [[negative feedback]] to maintain desired states.

==The law of adaptation==

The law of adaptation can be stated informally as: 
{{quote|Every adaptive system converges to a state in which all kind of stimulation ceases.&lt;ref&gt;José Antonio Martín H., Javier de Lope and Darío Maravall: "Adaptation, Anticipation and Rationality in Natural and Artificial Systems: Computational Paradigms Mimicking Nature" Natural Computing, December, 2009. Vol. 8(4), pp. 757-775. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11047-008-9096-6 doi]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Formally, the law can be defined as follows:

Given a system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, we say that a physical event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a stimulus for the system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the probability &lt;math&gt;P(S \rightarrow S'|E)&lt;/math&gt; that the system suffers a change or be perturbed (in its elements or in its processes) when the event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; occurs is strictly greater than the prior probability that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; suffers a change independently of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;P(S \rightarrow S'|E)&gt;P(S \rightarrow S') &lt;/math&gt;

''Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary system subject to changes in time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary event that is a stimulus for the system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;: we say that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is an adaptive system if and only if when t tends to infinity &lt;math&gt;(t\rightarrow \infty)&lt;/math&gt; the probability that the system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; change its behavior &lt;math&gt;(S\rightarrow S')&lt;/math&gt; in a time step &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; given the event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the probability that the system change its behavior independently of the occurrence of the event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. In mathematical terms:''

#- &lt;math&gt; P_{t_0}(S\rightarrow S'|E) &gt; P_{t_0}(S\rightarrow S') &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;
#- &lt;math&gt; \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} P_t(S\rightarrow S' | E) = P_t(S\rightarrow S')&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for each instant &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; will exist a temporal interval &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt; P_{t+h}(S\rightarrow S' | E) - P_{t+h}(S\rightarrow S') &lt; P_t(S\rightarrow S' | E) - P_t(S\rightarrow S')&lt;/math&gt;

==Benefit of self-adjusting systems==
In an adaptive system, a parameter changes slowly and has no preferred value.  In a self-adjusting system though, the parameter value “depends on the history of the system dynamics”.  One of the most important qualities of ''self-adjusting systems'' is its “[[edge of chaos|adaptation to the edge of chaos]]” or ability to avoid [[chaos theory|chaos]].  Practically speaking, by heading to the [[edge of chaos]] without going further, a leader may act spontaneously yet without disaster.  A March/April 2009 Complexity article further explains the self-adjusting systems used and the realistic implications.&lt;ref&gt;Hübler, A. &amp; Wotherspoon, T.: "Self-Adjusting Systems Avoid Chaos". Complexity. 14(4), 8 – 11. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Physicists have shown that [[adaptation]] to the [[edge of chaos]] occurs in almost all systems with [[feedback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wotherspoon|first1=T.|last2=Hubler|first2=A.|title=Adaptation to the edge of chaos with random-wavelet feedback|journal=J Phys Chem A|doi=10.1021/jp804420g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practopoiesis==
''Practopoiesis,'' a term due to its originator Danko Nikolić, is a reference to a kind of adaptive or self-adjusting system in which [[autopoiesis]] of an ''organism'' or a ''cell'' occurs through [[allopoiesis|allopoietic]] interactions among its ''components''.&lt;ref name=Nikolic2015&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251931500106X|title=Practopoiesis: Or how life fosters a mind. |author=Danko Nikolić|date=2015|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.03.003|volume=373|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|pages=40–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The components are organized into a [[poiesis|poietic]] hierarchy: one component creates another. The theory proposes that living systems exhibit a hierarchy of four such poietic operations in total:

    ''evolution'' (i) &amp;rarr; ''gene expression'' (ii) &amp;rarr; ''non gene-involving homeostatic mechanisms (anapoiesis)'' (iii) &amp;rarr; ''cell function'' (iv)

Practopoiesis challenges current neuroscience doctrine by asserting that mental operations primarily occur at the anapoietic level (iii) &amp;mdash; i.e., that minds emerge from fast homeostatic (adaptive) mechanisms. This contrasts the widespread belief that thinking is synonymous with neural activity ('cell function' at level iv). 

Each lower level contains knowledge that is more general than the higher level; for example, genes contain more general knowledge than anapoietic mechanisms, which in turn contain more general knowledge than cell functions. This hierarchy of knowledge enables the anapoietic level to directly store concepts, which are necessary for the emergence of mind.

==History and background==
{{Main|Warder Clyde Allee}}

Although the concept of Allee effect had no title at the time, it was first described in the 1930s by its namesake, [[Warder Clyde Allee]]. Through experimental studies, Allee was able to demonstrate that goldfish grow more rapidly when there are more individuals within the tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Allee WC, Bowen E |year=1932 |title=Studies in animal aggregations: mass protection against colloidal silver among goldfishes |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology |volume=61 |pages=185–207 |doi=10.1002/jez.1400610202 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led him to conclude that aggregation can improve the survival rate of individuals, and that cooperation may be crucial in the overall evolution of social structure. The term "Allee principle" was introduced in the 1950s, a time when the field of ecology was heavily focused on the role of competition among and within species.&lt;ref name=book1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author =Odum EP |year=1953 |title=Fundamentals of Ecology |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical view of population dynamics stated that due to competition for resources, a population will experience a reduced overall growth rate at higher density and increased growth rate at lower density. In other words, individuals in a population would be better off when there are fewer individuals around due to a limited amount of resources (see [[Logistic function#In ecology: modeling population growth|logistic growth]]). However, the concept of the Allee effect introduced the idea that the reverse holds true when the population density is low. Individuals within a species often require the assistance of another individual for more than simple reproductive reasons in order to persist. The most obvious example of this is observed in animals that hunt for prey or defend against predators as a group.

==Definition==

The generally accepted definition of Allee effect is positive density dependence, or the positive correlation between population density and individual fitness. It is sometimes referred to as "undercrowding" and it is analogous (or even considered synonymous by some) to "[[depensation]]" in the field of [[fishery science]]s.&lt;ref name=book1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Stephens PA, Sutherland WJ, Freckleton RP |year=1999 |title=What is the Allee effect? |journal=Oikos |volume=87 |pages=185–190 |doi=10.2307/3547011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listed below are a few significant subcategories of the Allee effect used in the ecology literature.

===Component vs. demographic Allee effects===
The '''component Allee effect''' is the positive relationship between any measurable component of individual fitness and population density. The '''demographic Allee effect''' is the positive relationship between the overall individual fitness and population density.

The distinction between the two terms lies on the scale of the Allee effect: the presence of a demographic Allee effect suggests the presence of at least one component Allee effect, while the presence of a component Allee effect does not necessarily result in a demographic Allee effect. For example, cooperative hunting and the ability to more easily find mates, both influenced by population density, are component Allee effects, as they influence individual fitness of the population. At low population density, these component Allee effects would add up to produce an overall demographic Allee effect (increased fitness with higher population density). When population density reaches a high number, negative density dependence often offsets the component Allee effects through resource competition, thus erasing the demographic Allee effect.&lt;ref name=kramer&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Kramer AM, Dennis B, Liebhold AM, Drake JM |year=2009 |title=The evidence for Allee effects |journal=Population Ecology |volume=51 |pages=341–354 |doi=10.1007/s10144-009-0152-6 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that Allee effects might occur even at high population density for some species.&lt;ref name=book1 /&gt;

===Strong vs. weak Allee effects===
[[File:A graph showing the difference between strong and weak Allee effects.svg|thumb|right|Allee effects are classified by the nature of density dependence at low densities. If the population shrinks for low densities, there is a strong Allee effect. If the proliferation rate is positive and increasing then there is a weak Allee effect. The null hypothesis is that proliferation rates are positive but decreasing at low densities.]]

The '''strong Allee effect''' is a demographic Allee effect with a critical population size or density. The '''weak Allee effect''' is a demographic Allee effect without a critical population size or density.

The distinction between the two terms is based on whether or not the population in question exhibits a [[extinction threshold|critical population size or density]]. A population exhibiting a weak Allee effect will possess a reduced per capita growth rate (directly related to individual fitness of the population) at lower population density or size. However, even at this low population size or density, the population will always exhibit a positive per capita growth rate. Meanwhile, a population exhibiting a strong Allee effect will have a critical population size or density under which the population growth rate becomes negative. Therefore, when the population density or size hits a number below this threshold, the population will be destined for extinction without any further aid. A strong Allee effect is often easier to demonstrate empirically using time series data, as one can pinpoint the population size or density at which per capita growth rate becomes negative.&lt;ref name=book1 /&gt;

==Mechanisms==

Due to its definition as the positive correlation between population density and average fitness, the mechanisms for which an Allee effect arises are therefore inherently tied to survival and reproduction. In general, these Allee effect mechanisms arise from cooperation or facilitation among individuals in the species. Examples of such cooperative behaviors include better mate finding, environmental conditioning, and group defense against predators. As these mechanisms are more easily observable in the field, they tend to be more commonly associated with the Allee effect concept. Nevertheless, mechanisms of Allee effect that are less conspicuous such as [[inbreeding depression]] and [[sex ratio]] bias should be considered as well.

===Ecological mechanism===
Although numerous ecological mechanisms for Allee effects exist, the list of most commonly cited facilitative behaviors that contribute to Allee effects in the literature include: mate limitation, cooperative defense, cooperative feeding, and environmental conditioning.&lt;ref name=kramer /&gt; While these behaviors are classified in separate categories, note that they can overlap and tend to be context dependent (will operate only under certain conditions – for example, cooperative defense will only be useful when there are predators or competitors present).

;Mate limitation: Mate limitation refers to the difficulty of finding a compatible and receptive mate for sexual reproduction at lower population size or density. This is generally a problem encountered by species that utilize passive reproduction and possess low mobility, such as [[plankton]], plants and sessile invertebrates.&lt;ref name="Berec L 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Berec L, Angulo E, Courchamp F |year=2007 |title=Multiple Allee effects and population management |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=22 |pages=185–191 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2006.12.002 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, wind-pollinated plants would have a lower fitness in sparse populations due to the lower likelihood of pollen successfully landing on a conspecific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Davis HG, Taylor CM, Lambrinos JG, Strong DR |year=2004 |title=Pollen limitation causes an Allee effect in a wind-pollinated invasive grass (''Spartina alterniflora'') |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=101 |pages=13804–13807 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0405230101 |issue=38|bibcode = 2004PNAS..10113804D |pmid=15317944 |pmc=518837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Cooperative defense: Another possible benefit of aggregation is to protect against predation by group anti-predator behavior. Many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, thus reducing the fitness of an individual living in smaller groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Mooring MS, Fitzpatrick TA, Nishihira TT, Reisig DD |year=2004 |title=Vigilance, predation risk, and the Allee effect in desert bighorn sheep |journal=Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=68 |pages=519–532 |doi=10.2193/0022-541X(2004)068[0519:VPRATA]2.0.CO;2 |editor1-last=Hall |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One striking example of such shared vigilance is exhibited by [[meerkat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Clutton-Brock TH, Gaynor D, McIlrath GM, MacColl AD, Kansky R, Chadwick P, Manser M, Skinner JD, Brotherton PN |year=1999 |title=Predation, group size and mortality in a cooperative mongoose, ''Suricata suricatta'' |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |volume=68 |pages=672–683 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2656.1999.00317.x |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, other species move in synchrony to confuse and avoid predators such as schools of [[sardines]] and flocks of [[starlings]]. The confusion effect that this herding behavior would have on predators will be more effective when more individuals are present.&lt;ref name=book1 /&gt;

;Cooperative feeding: Certain species also require group foraging in order to survive. As an example, species that hunt in packs, such as the [[African wild dog]]s, would not be able to locate and capture prey as efficiently in smaller groups.&lt;ref name="Berec L 2006"/&gt;

;Environmental conditioning / habitat alteration: Environmental conditioning generally refers to the mechanism in which individuals work together in order to improve their immediate or future environment for the benefit of the species. This alteration could involve changes in both abiotic (temperature, turbulence, etc.) or biotic (toxins, hormones, etc.) environmental factors. [[Pacific salmon]] present a potential case of such component Allee effects, where the density of spawning individuals can affect the survivability of the following generations. Spawning salmon carry marine nutrients they acquired from the ocean as they migrate to freshwater streams to reproduce, which in turn fertilize the surrounding habitat when they die, thus creating a more suitable habitat for the juveniles that would hatch in the following months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Rinella DJ, Wipfli MS, Stricker CA, Heintz RA, Rinella MJ |year=2012 |title=Pacific salmon (''Oncorhynchus'' spp.) runs and consumer fitness: growth and energy storage in stream-dwelling salmonids increase with salmon spawner density |journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences |volume=69 |pages=73–84 |doi=10.1139/f2011-133}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While compelling, this case of environmental conditioning by salmon has not been rigorously supported by empirical evidence.

=== Human induced ===
Classic economic theory predicts that human exploitation of a population is unlikely to result in species extinction because the escalating costs to find the last few individuals will exceed the fixed price one achieves by selling the individuals on the market. However, when rare species are more desirable than common species, prices for rare species can exceed high harvest costs. This phenomenon can create an "anthropogenic" Allee effect where rare species go extinct but common species are sustainably harvested.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Courchamp|first=Franck|last2=Angulo|first2=Elena|last3=Rivalan|first3=Philippe|last4=Hall|first4=Richard J.|last5=Signoret|first5=Laetitia|last6=Bull|first6=Leigh|last7=Meinard|first7=Yves|date=2006-11-28|title=Rarity Value and Species Extinction: The Anthropogenic Allee Effect|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040415|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=4|issue=12|pages=e415|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040415|issn=1545-7885}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropogenic Allee effect has become a standard approach for conceptualizing the threat of economic markets on endangered species.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=McDonald-Madden|first2=Eve|date=2017-09-21|title=High prices for rare species can drive large populations extinct: the anthropogenic Allee effect revisited|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519317302916|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=429|pages=170–180|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.06.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the original theory was posited using a one dimensional analysis of a two dimensional model.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  It turns out that a two dimensional analysis yields an Allee curve in human exploiter and biological population space and that this curve separating species destined to extinction vs persistence can be complicated. Even very high population sizes can potentially pass through the originally proposed Allee thresholds on predestined paths to extinction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Genetic mechanisms ===
Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to [[genetic diversity|genetic variation]]'s role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this [[population bottleneck|genetic bottleneck]] is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of [[genetic drift]], as well as [[inbreeding depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author =Frankham R |year=1996 |title=Relationship of genetic variation to population size in wildlife- a review |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=10 |pages=1500–1508 |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1996.10061500.x |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of [[Mutation#Harmful mutations|deleterious mutations]] throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed ([[genetic drift]]). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.&lt;ref name=book1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author =Gillespie JH |year=2004 |title=Population genetics: a concise guide |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore, Maryland, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author =Reed DH |year=2010 |title=Albatrosses, eagles and newts, Oh My!: exceptions to the prevailing paradigm concerning genetic diversity and population viability? |journal=Animal Conservation |volume=13 |pages=448–457 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-1795.2010.00353.x |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such case was observed in the endangered [[Florida panther]] (''Puma concolor coryi''). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ~ 25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |year=2010 |title=Genetic restoration of the Florida panther |journal=Science |volume=329 |pages=1641–1645 |bibcode=2010Sci...329.1641J |last1=Johnson|first1=WE|last2=Onorato |first2=DP|last3=Roelke |first3=MW|last4=Land |first4=ED|last5=Cunningham |first5=M|last6=Belden |first6=RC|last7=McBride |first7=R|last8=Jansen |first8=D|last9=Lotz |first9=M|displayauthors=8|doi=10.1126/science.1192891 |pmid=20929847 |issue=5999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led to the reduction in the prevalence of the defects previously associated with inbreeding depression. Although the timescale for this inbreeding depression is larger than of those more immediate Allee effects, it has significant implications on the long-term persistence of a species.

===Demographic stochasticity===
Demographic stochasticity refers to variability in population growth arising from sampling random births and deaths in a population of finite size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198525257.003.0001|title=Demographic and environmental stochasticity|last=Lande|first=Russell|last2=Engen|first2=Steinar|last3=SÆther|first3=Bernt-Erik|pages=1–24|language=en|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198525257.003.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In small populations, demographic stochasticity will decrease the population growth rate, causing an effect similar to the Allee effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lande R | year = 1998 | title = Demographic stochasticity and Allee effect on a scale with isotropic noise | url = | journal = Oikos | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 353–358 | doi=10.2307/3546849}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will increase the risk of population extinction. Whether or not demographic stochasticity can be considered a part of Allee effect is somewhat contentious however. The most current definition of Allee effect considers the correlation between population density and mean individual fitness. Therefore, random variation resulting from birth and death events would not be considered part of Allee effect as the increased risk of extinction is not a consequence of the changing fates of individuals within the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Bessa-Gomes C, Legendre S, Clobert J |year=2004 |title=Allee effects, mating systems and the extinction risk in populations with two sexes |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=7 |pages=802–812 |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00632.x |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Meanwhile, when demographic stochasticity results in fluctuations of sex ratios, it arguably reduces the mean individual fitness as population declines. For example, a fluctuation in small population that causes a scarcity in one sex would in turn limit the access of mates for the opposite sex, decreasing the fitness of the individuals within the population. This type of Allee effect will likely be more prevalent in [[monogamy|monogamous]] species than [[polygyny|polygynous]] species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Engen S, Lande R, Saether BE |year=2003 |title=Demographic stochasticity and Allee effects in populations with two sexes |journal=Ecology |volume=84 |pages=2378–2386 |doi=10.1890/02-0123 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on range-expanding populations==

Demographic and mathematical studies demonstrate that the existence of an Allee effect can reduce the speed of range expansion of a population&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Lewis MA, Kareiva P |year=1993 |title=Allee dynamics and the spread of invading organisms |journal=Theoretical Population Biology |volume=43 |pages=141–158 |doi=10.1006/tpbi.1993.1007 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author =Lewis MA, [[Pauline van den Driessche|van den Driessche P]] |year=1993 |title=Waves of extinction from sterile insect release |journal=Mathematical Biosciences |volume=116 |pages=221–247 |doi=10.1016/0025-5564(93)90067-K |pmid=8369600 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Tobin PC, Whitmire SL, Johnson DN, Bjørnstad ON, Liebhold AM |year=2007 |title=Invasion speed is affected by geographic variation in the strength of Allee effects |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=10 |pages=36–43 |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.00991.x |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Johnson DM, Liebhold AM, Tobin PC, Bjørnstad ON |year=2006 |title=Allee effects and pulsed invasion by the gypsy moth |journal=Nature |volume=444 |pages=361–363 |doi=10.1038/nature05242|bibcode=2006Natur.444..361J }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can even prevent biological invasions.&lt;ref name=Gar12&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Garnier J, Roques L, Hamel F |year=2012 |title=Success rate of a biological invasion in terms of the spatial distribution of the founding population |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology |volume=74 |pages=453–473 |doi=10.1007/s11538-011-9694-9 |pmid=21972031 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent results based on spatio-temporal models show that the Allee effect can also promote genetic diversity in expanding populations.&lt;ref name=Roq12&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Roques L, Garnier J, Hamel F, Klein EK |year=2012 |title=Allee effect promotes diversity in traveling waves of colonization |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA |doi=10.1073/pnas.1201695109 |volume=109 |issue=23 |pages=8828–33 |pmid=22611189 |pmc=3384151|bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.8828R }}&lt;/ref&gt; These results counteract commonly held notions that the Allee effect possesses net adverse consequences. Reducing the growth rate of the individuals ahead of the colonization front simultaneously reduces the speed of colonization and enables a diversity of genes coming from the core of the population to remain on the front. The Allee effect also affects the spatial distribution of diversity. Whereas spatio-temporal models which do not include an Allee effect lead to a vertical pattern of genetic diversity (i.e., a strongly structured spatial distribution of genetic fractions), those including an Allee effect lead to a "horizontal pattern" of genetic diversity (i.e., an absence of genetic differentiation in space).&lt;ref name=Roq12 /&gt;

==Mathematical models==

A simple mathematical example of an Allee effect is given by the cubic growth model
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt} = r N \left( \frac{N}{A} - 1 \right) \left( 1 - \frac{N}{K} \right),&lt;/math&gt;
where the population has a negative growth rate for &lt;math&gt; 0&lt; N &lt; A &lt;/math&gt;, and 
a positive growth rate for &lt;math&gt; A &lt; N &lt; K &lt;/math&gt; (assuming &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; A &lt; K &lt;/math&gt;).
This is a departure from the [[logistic function|logistic growth equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt} = r  N \left( 1- \frac{N}{K} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:N = population size;
:r = [[Population dynamics|intrinsic rate of increase]];
:K = [[carrying capacity]];
:A = critical point; and
:dN/dt = rate of increase of the population.

After dividing both sides of the equation by the population size N, in the logistic growth the left hand side of the equation represents the per capita population growth rate, which is dependent on the population size N, and decreases with increasing N throughout the entire range of population sizes. In contrast, when there is an Allee effect the per-capita growth rate increases with increasing N over some range of population sizes [0, N].&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|pQTNFYPgDdEC|Essentials of Ecology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spatio-temporal models can take Allee effect into account as well. A simple example is given by the reaction-diffusion model
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial N}{\partial t} =D \frac{\partial^2 N}{\partial x^2}+ r N \left( \frac{N}{A} - 1 \right) \left( 1 - \frac{N}{K} \right),&lt;/math&gt;
where
: D=[[diffusion coefficient]]; 
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}&lt;/math&gt; = one-dimensional [[Laplace operator]].

When a population is made up of small sub-populations additional factors to the Allee effect arise.

If the sub-populations are subject to different environmental variations (i.e. separated enough that a disaster could occur at one sub-population site without affecting the other sub-populations) but still allow individuals to travel between sub-populations, then the individual sub-populations are more likely to go extinct than the total population. In the case of a catastrophic event decreasing numbers at a sub-population, individuals from another sub-population site may be able to repopulate the area.

If all sub-populations are subject to the same environmental variations (i.e. if a disaster affected one, it would affect them all) then [[population fragmentation|fragmentation]] of the population is detrimental to the population and increases extinction risk for the total population. In this case, the species receives none of the benefits of a small sub-population (loss of the sub-population is not catastrophic to the species as a whole) and all of the disadvantages ([[inbreeding]] depression, loss of [[genetic diversity]] and increased vulnerability to environmental instability) and the population would survive better unfragmented.&lt;ref name=Gar12 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Minimum viable population size |vauthors=Traill LW, Brook BW, Bradshaw CJ |date=6 March 2010 |work=Ecology Theory |publisher=The Encyclopedia of Earth |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Minimum_viable_population_size |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allee principles of aggregation==

Clumping results due to individuals aggregating in response to: 1) local habitat or landscape differences, 2) daily and seasonal weather changes, 3) reproductive processes, or 4) as the result of social attractions.

The '''belief–desire–intention''' ('''BDI''') model of human practical reasoning was developed by [[Michael Bratman]] as a way of explaining future-directed intention.

BDI is fundamentally reliant on [[folk psychology]] (the 'theory theory'), which is the notion that our mental models of the world are theories. It was used as a basis for developing the [[belief–desire–intention software model]].

==Applications==

BDI was part of the inspiration behind the [[Belief–desire–intention software model|BDI software architecture]], which Bratman was also involved in developing. Here, the notion of intention was seen as a way of limiting time spent on deliberating about what to do, by eliminating choices inconsistent with current intentions.

BDI has also aroused some interest in psychology. BDI formed the basis for a computational model of childlike reasoning [https://web.archive.org/web/20070629002644/http://cognition.iig.uni-freiburg.de/csq/pdf-files/Wahl_Spada.pdf CRIBB]. It has been proposed that autistic children do not recognise other people as folk-psychological agents (i.e., agents with their own beliefs, etc.). BDI has been used to develop a [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/7906/21803/01011803.pdf rehabilitation strategy] to teach autistic children to reason about other people.

[[File:Algae hydrogen production.jpg|thumb|Microbial hydrogen production.]]
'''Biohydrogen''' is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is produced biologically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biohydrogen|editor=M. Rögner|year=2015|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-033673-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interest is high in this technology because H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a clean fuel and can be readily produced from certain kinds of biomass.&lt;ref&gt;Y.-H. Percival Zhang "Hydrogen Production from Carbohydrates: A Mini-Review" in "Sustainable Production of Fuels, Chemicals, and Fibers from Forest Biomass" ACS Symposium Series, 2011, Volume 1067, pages=203-216.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many challenges characterize this technology, including those intrinsic to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such as storage and transportation of a noncondensible gas.  Hydrogen producing organisms are poisoned by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Yields of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are often low.

==Biochemical principles==
The main reactions involve [[fermentation]] of sugars.  Important reactions start with [[glucose]], which is converted to [[acetic acid]]:&lt;ref&gt;Thauer, R. K., "Biochemistry of Methanogenesis: a Tribute to Marjory Stephenson", Microbiology 1998, 144, 2377-2406.  {{DOI|10.1099/00221287-144-9-2377}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →  2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
A related reaction gives [[formate]] instead of [[carbon dioxide]]:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →  2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 HCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
These reactions are exergonic by 216 and 209 kcal/mol, respectively.

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production is catalyzed by two [[hydrogenase]]s.  One is called [FeFe]-hydrogenase; the other is called [NiFe]-hydrogenase.  Many organisms express these enzymes.  Notable examples are members of the genera [[Clostridium]], [[Desulfovibrio]], [[Ralstonia]], and the pathogen ''[[Helicobacter]]''.  ''[[E. coli]]'' is the workhorse for genetic engineering of hydrogenases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Cammack, R.; Frey, M.; Robson, R.|title=Hydrogen as a Fuel: Learning from Nature|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|place=London|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that 99% of all organisms utilize [[dihydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Most of these species are microbes and their ability to use H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a metabolite arises from the expression of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[metalloenzyme]]s known as hydrogenases.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogenases are sub-classified into three different types based on the active site metal content: iron-iron hydrogenase, nickel-iron hydrogenase, and iron hydrogenase.

==History==
In 1933, [[Marjory Stephenson]] and her student Stickland reported that cell suspensions catalysed the reduction of [[methylene blue]] with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Six years later, [[Hans Gaffron]] observed that the green photosynthetic alga ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'', would sometimes  produce hydrogen.  Gaffron and many other scientists failed to elucidate how it induced hydrogen production. In the late 1990s [[Anastasios Melis]] discovered that deprivation of sulfur induces the alga to switch from the production of oxygen (normal photosynthesis) to the production of hydrogen. He found that the [[enzyme]] responsible for this reaction is [[hydrogenase]], but that the hydrogenase lost this function in the presence of oxygen. Melis also discovered that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted their internal oxygen flow, allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react, causing the algae to produce hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/mustread.html?pg=5 Reengineering Algae To Fuel The Hydrogen Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chlamydomonas moewusii'' is also a promising strain for the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/127/3/740 |vauthors=Melis A, Happe T|lastauthoramp=yes |year = 2001 | title = Hydrogen Production.

==Industrial hydrogen==
Competing for biohydrogen, at least for commercial applications, are many mature industrial processes.  Hydrogen is usually derived from [[fossil fuels]] by [[steam reforming]] of [[natural gas]] - sometimes referred to as steam methane reforming (SMR) - is the most common method of producing bulk hydrogen at about 95% of the world production.&lt;ref&gt;P.

==History==

[[Mathew D. McCubbins|Mathew McCubbins]], [[Roger Noll]], and [[Barry Weingast]] first defined the theory of bureaucratic drift in 1987.&lt;ref name="McCubbins"/&gt; They argued that drift is essentially a principal-agent problem that explores "how—or indeed, whether—elected political officials can reasonably effectively assure that their policy intentions will be carried out."&lt;ref name="McCubbins"/&gt; The major tenets of the theory include how bureaucrats can manipulate policy when creating bureaucratic agencies and the argument that delay built into the bureaucracy is a good thing, because delay gives government a chance to perfect a policy over time.&lt;ref name="McCubbins"/&gt;

In 1989, Murray Horn and Kenneth Shepsle proposed that coalitional drift, the phenomenon of present legislation being overwritten by the changing views of [[political coalitions]], is a trade-off to bureaucratic drift.&lt;ref name="Horn"/&gt; The relationship between bureaucratic and coalitional drift is a disputed part of the bureaucratic drift theory.&lt;ref name="Macey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shepsle(1992)" /&gt;

In 1992, [[Jonathan R. Macey|Jonathan Macey]] hypothesized that the creation of an agency's structure and design is instrumental in preventing bureaucratic drift.&lt;ref name="Macey"/&gt; Macey speculates that both current interest groups and Congress benefit from the careful structure and design of a bureaucratic agency. The former is pleased by policies that continue to reflect their preferences while the latter is pleased that both bureaucratic and coalitional drift are protected against.&lt;ref name="Macey"/&gt; Contrary to Horn and Shepsle, Macey argues that coalitional drift and bureaucratic drift aren't necessarily opposing forces, but that the careful construction of an agency's structure and design can mitigate the costs of both types of drift.&lt;ref name="Macey"/&gt; He also disagrees with McCubbins, Noll and Weingast on the power of delay to reduce bureaucratic drift, because extra time gives future interest groups and a future Congress the opportunity to insert their own preferences into the proposed policy.&lt;ref name="Macey"/&gt; This is an example of coalitional and bureaucratic drift working counter to each other.

==Causes==
Scholars have identified three major areas that contribute to bureaucratic drift: how bureaucracies are structured, interest groups that lobby bureaucracies, and presidential appointments of bureaucratic leaders.

===Structural===
Bureaucratic agencies are often structured so that legislators and their staffers have the opportunity to easily monitor bureaucratic activity.&lt;ref name = Shepsle(1992)&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shepsle|first=Kenneth|title=Bureaucratic Drift, Coalitional Drift, and Time Consistency: A Comment on Macey|journal=Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization|date=March 1992|jstor=10.2307/764892}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some scholars believe that structural organization can help lessen bureaucratic drift,&lt;ref name = Macy(1992)&gt;{{cite journal|last=Macey|first=Jonathan|title=Organizational Design and Political Control of Administrative Agencies|journal=Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization|date=March 1992|volume=8|jstor=10.2307/764891}}&lt;/ref&gt; other scholars have found that this approach can backfire.&lt;ref name = "Shepsle(1992)"/&gt; When a bureaucracy is permeable anyone can access it, including legislators who were originally adverse to the legislation being implemented.&lt;ref name = "Shepsle(1992)"/&gt; Further, scholars argue that if a bureaucratic agency is designed to represent a single interest, its implementations are more likely to reflect the views of the people they are representing than they are the views of the legislature.&lt;ref name = "Macy(1992)"/&gt;

===Lobbying===
Making bureaucracies easily accessible means that interest groups can have a greater influence on the outcome of policy implementation.&lt;ref name = "Macy(1992)"/&gt; Some scholars believe that bureaucracies can have positive interactions with interest groups.&lt;ref name = Chubbs&gt;{{cite book|last=Chubb|first=John|title=Interest groups and the bureaucracy: the politics of energy|year=1983|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Sanford, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such an interaction is when interest groups support bureaucracies by providing information and facts about areas the bureaucracy is meant to promote or serve.&lt;ref name = "Chubbs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=John|title=Interest Groups, Advisory Committees, and Congressional Control of the Bureaucracy|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=October 2001|doi=10.2307/2669325|volume=45|pages=799}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars, however, have found that interest groups can cause bureaucratic drift. When a bureaucratic agency is infiltrated or corrupted by an external group whose views do not align with the preferences of the legislature it is said that the bureaucratic agency is captured.&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Stuart|title=Procedural Control of the Bureaucracy, Peer Review and Epistemic Drift|journal=Journal of Public Administrative Research and Theory|pages=535–538|doi=10.1093/jopart/mul026|volume=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schoenbrod&gt;{{cite book|last=Schoenbrod|first=David|title=Power Without Responsibility|year=1993|publisher=Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an interest group negotiates with a bureaucracy, it can bias the bureaucracy to implement policy that drifts from the original intention of the legislation so the policy instead better serves the needs of the interest group.&lt;ref name = Bertelli&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bertelli|first=Anthony|title=Remedial Bargaining and Bureaucratic Drift|journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Politics]]|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential appointments===
Scholars consider presidents active in the affairs of "independent" bureaucracies.&lt;ref name = Cromartie&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Joseph|author2=Jane S. Cromartie|title=Partisan Presidential Change and Regulatory Policy: The Case of the FTC and Deceptive Practices Enforcement|journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly|year=1982|volume=12|issue=4|jstor=10.2307/27547869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presidential nominations are sometimes considered a check on bureaucracies because it ensures reliable agent performance.&lt;ref name=LGS /&gt; However, presidents can use appointments for political gain.&lt;ref name=Nokken&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nokken|first=Timothy|title=Confirmation Dynamics: A Model of Presidential Appointments to Independent Agencies|journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Politics]]|volume=12|issue=1|pages=91–112|doi=10.1177/0951692800012001004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A president may wish to maintain bureaucratic drift if it lies in his or her favor.&lt;ref name="Nokken"/&gt;  An administrative agency can be captured by a president when he or she appoints a bureaucratic head that reaffirms bureaucratic drift that is favorable to the president's policies.&lt;ref name=Balla&gt;{{cite journal|last=Balla|first=Steven|title=Administrative Procedures and Political Control of the Bureaucracy|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=92|issue=3|pages=663–673|doi=10.2307/2585488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Nokken"/&gt;  In cases where bureaucratic drift is present, scholars believe that the president can change policy more rapidly than in a zero-drift scenario.&lt;ref name = "Balla"/&gt;

==Checks==

===Legislative checks===

Through congressional acts, the legislative branch has the power to curb bureaucratic drift.&lt;ref name="textbook"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lowi, Theodore J.|author2=Benjamin Ginsberg|author3=Kenneth A.

McCubbins|Mathew McCubbins]] and Thomas Schwartz have categorized oversight into two types- police patrol and fire alarm patrol.&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbins-Schwartz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="firealarm"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lupia | first1 = Arthur | last2 = McCubbins | first2 = Mathew D. | year = 1994 | title = Learning from Oversight: Fire Alarms and Police Patrols Reconstructed | journal = Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 96–117 | jstor=764815 | doi=10.1093/jleo/10.1.96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police patrol refers to oversight when legislators instigate investigations into bureaucracies and actively search for bureaucratic drift.&lt;ref name="McCubbins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="firealarm"/&gt; Such oversight may involve legislators monitoring agencies, reading reports, conducting field studies, and questioning officials.&lt;ref name="McCubbins"/&gt; Unlike police patrol, Congress also uses fire-alarm patrol by constructing procedures that allow citizens and interest groups to alert legislators of drift.&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="firealarm"/&gt; This method involves less action by congress, and McCubbins and Schwartz argue that it is preferred by legislators as it allows them to devote less time and resources to oversight.&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbins-Schwartz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hopenhayn"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hopenhayn | first1 = Hugo | last2 = Lohmann | first2 = Susanne | year = 1996 | title = Fire-Alarm Signals and the Political Oversight of Regulatory Agencies | journal = Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 196–212 | jstor=765043 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jleo.a023357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ogul | first1 = Morris S. | last2 = Rockman | first2 = Bert A. | year = 1990 | title = Overseeing Oversight: New Departures and Old Problems | journal = Legislative Studies Quarterly | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 5–24 | jstor=439999 | doi=10.2307/439999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars criticize fire-alarm patrol by arguing that citizens' complaints may never reach legislators and those that do may be deceitful, thus sounding "false alarms".&lt;ref name="firealarm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hopenhayn"/&gt;

===Judicial checks===

Because of the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]], the judicial branch is able to check bureaucratic drift through [[judicial review]].&lt;ref name="Macey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesquita"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mesquita | first1 = De | last2 = Bueno | first2 = Ethan | last3 = Stephenson | first3 = Matthew C. | year = 2007 | title = Regulatory Quality Under Imperfect Oversight | url = | journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 101 | issue = 3| page = 605 | doi=10.1017/s0003055407070359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Epstein"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Epstein | first1 = David | last2 = O'Halloran | first2 = Sharyn | year = 1994 | title = Administrative Procedures, Information, and Agency Discretion | journal = American Journal of Political Science | volume = 38 | issue = 3| pages = 697–722 | jstor=2111603 | doi=10.2307/2111603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macey2"&gt;Macey, Jonathon R.

Scholars have argued that the judicial branch checks bureaucratic drift most efficiently when controlling delays of implementing law. Timing is important because the process gives less organized groups time to learn about proposed actions and respond to these proposals.&lt;ref name=Macey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macey2/&gt;
The same scholars point out that ongoing delays caused by judicial review on agency actions may discourage less organized interest, because such groups lack the resources necessary to maintain an effective coalition over long periods of time.&lt;ref name=Macey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macey2/&gt; Other scholars argue that judicial review also allows less organized groups to hire lawyers to assist in monitoring agency actions.&lt;ref name=Macey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Horn/&gt;

===Executive checks===

The president has the power to check bureaucratic drift through [[executive order]]s and by choosing appointees for the highest post of bureaucracies.&lt;ref name="McCubbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Balla" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Macey2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = B. Dan | last2 = Bohte | first2 = John | year = 2004 | title = Political Transaction Costs and the Politics of Administrative Design | url = | journal = The Journal of Politics | volume = 66 | issue = 1| pages = 176–202 | jstor = 3449778 | doi=10.1046/j.1468-2508.2004.00147.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A president can attempt to affect drift by choosing appointees whose preferences closely resemble his or her own.&lt;ref name=McCubbins/&gt;&lt;ref name=Balla/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macey2/&gt;
Also cabinet officials have their own independent evaluation staffs in charge of ensuring that agencies do not drift from government decisions.&lt;ref name=McCubbins/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wood/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lowi"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lowi, Theodore J.|author2=Benjamin Ginsberg|author3=Kenneth A. Shepsle|title=American Government: Power and Purpose|location=New York|publisher=Norton|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monitoring bureaucratic agencies is also possible through the [[Office of Management and Budget]] as well as the White House staff.&lt;ref name=McCubbins/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesquita"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lowi/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seidenfeld"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seidenfeld | first1 = Mark | year = 2001 | title = The Psychology of Accountability and Political Review of Agency Rules | url = | journal = Duke Law Journal | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 1059–1095 | doi=10.2307/1373184}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since Congress controls the amount of money appropriated to bureaucratic agencies, monitoring by the Office of Management and Budget is limited.&lt;ref name=Balla/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesquita"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macey2/&gt; The [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]], a division of the Office of Management and Budget, can delay agency regulations it deems unsatisfactory.&lt;ref name="Mesquita"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seidenfeld"/&gt;
Scholars argue that one problem of the executive branch working to reduce bureaucratic drift is that it wastes time and resources that could be spent serving constituents.&lt;ref name=McCubbins/&gt;&lt;ref name=Balla/&gt;
Also other scholars point out that future coalitions may tamper with carefully negotiated bargains. Therefore executives often focus more on work they can immediately benefit from.&lt;ref name="Horn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shipan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shipan, Charles R.|title=Designing Judicial Review: Interest Groups, Congress, and Communications Policy|location=Ann Arbor|publisher=University of Michigan |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
While some scholars believe that delegation is a necessary part of the American government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = Marci A | year = 1995 | title = Power, Responsibility, and Republican Democracy | url = | journal = Michigan Law Review | volume = 93 | issue = 6| pages = 1539–1558 | doi=10.2307/1289892}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and that bureaucratic drift is a risk that must be weighed when delegating implementation powers, others believe that delegation of power to bureaucracy is both unconstitutional and happens too frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allen | first1 = Marc | last2 = Meier | first2 = Kenneth J. | year = 1990 | title = Presidential Control versus Bureaucratic Power: Explaining the Reagan Revolution in Antitrust | journal = American Journal of Political Science | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 269–87 | jstor=2111519 | doi = 10.2307/2111519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schoenbrod | first1 = David | year = 2003 | title = Politics and the Principle That Elected Legislators Should Make the Laws | url = | journal = Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy | volume = 26 | issue = 1| page = 239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Schoenbrod, David|title=Rule of law: It's time Congress took back its power to make laws|work=Wall Street Journal, |edition=Eastern|date=6 December 1995|page=A21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Does Congress Delegate Too Much Power To Agencies And What Should Be Done About It? US House of Representatives, 2000. {{ISBN|0160659973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  These scholars subscribe to the Non-delegation Doctrine, and believe that the risk posed by bureaucratic drift is disruptive enough to American politics that delegation must be reconsidered or even eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bergin | first1 = Amee | year = 2001 | title = Does Application Of The APA'S 'Committed To Agency Discretion' Exception Violate The Nondelegation Doctrine? | url = | journal = Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review | volume = 28 | issue = 2-3| pages = 363–398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schoenbrod, David|title=Power Without Responsibility: How Congress Abuses the People Through Delegation|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9836">In 2008 [[Club de Madrid|the Club of Madrid]], the [[Bellona Foundation]] and the utility company [[Hafslund ASA]] joined forces to organize the top level climate conference in Norway called [[#CC8]] (Climate Conference 08: Technology and Finance in Climate Cooperation). In 2009 the same organizers are arranging '''CC9''' (Climate Conference 09: Green Technology and Finance – Striking a Fair Climate Deal) which will take place on 4 and 5 June at Hafslund Manor in Sarpsborg, Norway. It will be followed by a climate festival for children in the adjacent park on 6 June.

== Climate Conference 09 ==

The objective of CC9 is to contribute to the conclusion of a fair climate agreement by advancing the potential of [[green technology]] and adequate funding. Investing in the development and diffusion of green technologies and renewable energy is a sustainable way to stimulate the economy and create new jobs - sustainable economic growth that can reinforce efforts to [[Climate change mitigation|combat climate change]] while respecting development needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CC9 | url=http://www.cc9.no/index.asp?artikkelid=1599 | accessdate=2009-06-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615080910/http://www.cc9.no/index.asp?artikkelid=1599# | archive-date=2009-06-15 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prestigious names to the conference ===

[[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway|His Royal Highnesses Crown Prince Haakon of Norway]] will open the Conference. 

Among those who will be speaking at CC9 is [[Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bellona Web | url=http://www.bellona.org/articles/articles_2008/kennedyToAttendConferenceInNorway | accessdate=2009-06-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613074513/http://www.bellona.org/articles/articles_2008/kennedyToAttendConferenceInNorway# | archive-date=2009-06-13 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who has made a name for himself as a clear-headed and dynamic advocate for the environment. Kennedy founded and now chairs the [[Waterkeeper Alliance]], an organization working to improve water quality in the US and elsewhere in the world. In his work as a lawyer, Kennedy handles cases for the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]]  (NRDC), one of the largest environmental organizations in the US. The NRDC is known as a solution-oriented and competent player in the environmental field. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the first member of the [[Kennedy family]] to visit Norway.

In addition to Mr. Kennedy, many other prestigious names will be participating at CC9, including Norwegian Prime Minister [[Jens Stoltenberg]], Norwegian Minister of the Environment and International Development [[Erik Solheim]] and [[Stephen O. Andersen]], director of Strategic Climate Projects in the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).

[[Stephen O. Andersen]] is a senior, renowned environmental expert, working for the EPA, the closest equivalent the USA has to a Ministry of the Environment. Mr. Andersen has been a key player in the work on the Montreal Protocol, an exceptionally successful international environmental treaty that negotiated the elimination of ozone-depleting gases and effectively saved the ozone layer. Andersen is the EPA's director of strategic projects, in the Climate Protection Partnerships Division.

Also from the USA comes [[Ira Magaziner]], head of the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Clinton Climate Initiative | url=http://www.clintonfoundation.org/what-we-do/clinton-climate-initiative/ | accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCI forms part of the William J. Clinton Foundation (founded by former US president Bill Clinton). The foundation's work includes efforts to cut the costs of climate technology (for renewable energy and energy efficiency) in large cities.

Representing the African continent are the former president of Tanzania, [[Benjamin Mkapa]], and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Niger [[Aïchatou Mindaoudou]]. Mindaoudou is a well-known figure in the field of international development, and she will be giving a speech at CC9 entitled "What is at stake for women and the planet - climate change and sustainable development in Africa. Business models for poverty alleviation and green growth".

A number of participants from Asia and Europe will also be present at the climate conference.

== Climate Conference 08 ==

Starting out on World Environment Day, the conference gathered 100 exclusively selected international representatives from politics, academia, the private sector and the environmental movement at the Hafslund Manor in Sarpsborg south of Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CC8 | url=http://www.cc8.no/index.asp?artikkelid=1416&amp;site=conferance | accessdate=2009-06-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620184329/http://www.cc8.no/index.asp?artikkelid=1416&amp;site=conferance# | archive-date=2011-06-20 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the distinguished speakers were: Ricardo Lagos, former president of Chile, UN Special Envoy on climate change and president of the Club of Madrid; Lord Nicholas Stern, author of the notable report on the economic ramifications of climate change; Göran Persson, former Prime Minister of Sweden who, together with Ricardo Lagos, co-chairs the International Socialist Commission for a Sustainable World Society  Also attending from the Club of Madrid was Jennifer Mary Shipley, former Prime Minister of New Zealand, Kjell Magne Bondevik and Gro Harlem Brundtland, both former Prime Ministers of Norway. The Club of Madrid, the Bellona Foundation and Hafslund ASA set out to organize an ambitious, pro-development, creative and solutions-oriented conference which could act in a joint effort to provide input for the international negotiation process on a new climate agreement.

Negotiations for a post-2012 global climate change agreement were formally launched at the climate summit in Bali last December and are expected to be concluded in Copenhagen in 2009. With this process underway, the Club of Madrid, the Bellona Foundation and Hafslund ASA joined forces to spur ideas for a final agreement that will be both ambitious and realistic, as well as providing predictability in efforts to combat climate change.

Thorough discussions in small working groups enabled the drafting of ambitious, creative and solutions-oriented recommendations in a final statement from the conference. In order to inform the post-2012 negotiations, the aim will be to reach out to both negotiators and policy makers and industry and the business community.

At the Bali summit, it was agreed to concentrate the negotiations on mitigation, adaptation, technology and finance. The CC8 conference «Technology and Finance in Climate Cooperation» focuses specifically on what technology and finance provisions a new agreement on climate change should include.

The co-organizers are convinced that successful outcomes in these fields will be essential to enable ambitious overall emission reduction targets (the overall objective of an agreement) and solve the contradiction between, on the one hand, rich countries’ responsibility for climate change and, on the other hand, the necessity to limit emissions also of emerging economies.

=== Climate Concert ===

Saturday 7 June the marathon "Climate Concert 08" was arranged in the park surrounding the Hafslund Manor in Sarpsborg. Well-known Norwegian bands were on stage. The environmental issues from the Climate Conference 08 coloured all parts of the arrangement; the food served, transportation and power supply.

The artists performing on Climate Conference 08, were [[Bertine Zetlitz]], [[Surferosa]], [[deLillos 85|deLillos'85]], [[Henning Kvitnes]], [[Kaizers Orchestra]], [[Madcon]], [[CC Cowboys]] and [[Ida Maria]].

== Background ==

Against the backdrop of an unprecedented global economic crisis, the next months will be decisive for reaching a politically viable and fair post-2012 climate agreement in Copenhagen 2009.

Few players inside negotiation circles expect developing countries to make significant moves before developed countries have clarified their positions on emission reductions, financing and diffusion of green technology.

Copenhagen must deliver on the human dimension of climate change. It is clear that the poorest, those least responsible, will be most vulnerable to climate change. Countries that have accumulated tremendous economic growth through their historic reliance on fossil fuels must assume a leadership role in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Likewise, it will be critical to secure the development and diffusion of appropriate, clean technology and the access to necessary financial resources for developing countries to adopt them.

The global crisis constitutes a tremendous opportunity for governments to address the weaknesses of the existing, international financial system but, more importantly, to lay the foundations for the development of a green and sustainable economy. Investing in clean technologies can be key to this process, creating employment opportunities across the globe while addressing the challenge of climate change. In this sense, the adoption of sectoral approaches within the negotiations could, in fact, facilitate technology development and the adoption of best available technologies across regions, between developed and developing countries.

'''Compressed sensing''' (also known as '''compressive sensing''', '''compressive sampling''', or '''sparse sampling''') is a [[signal processing]] technique for efficiently acquiring and reconstructing a [[Signal (electronics)|signal]], by finding solutions to [[Underdetermined system|underdetermined linear systems]]. This is based on the principle that, through optimization, the sparsity of a signal can be exploited to recover it from far fewer samples than required by the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem]]. There are two conditions under which recovery is possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2009/09/cs.html CS: Compressed Genotyping, DNA Sudoku - Harnessing high throughput sequencing for multiplexed specimen analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; The first one is [[sparsity]] which requires the signal to be sparse in some domain. The second one is [[Coherence (signal processing)|incoherence]] which is applied through the isometric property which is sufficient for sparse signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donoho | first1 = David L | year = 2006 | title =  For most large underdetermined systems of linear equations the minimal 1-norm solution is also the sparsest solution| url = | journal = Communications on pure and applied mathematics | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 797–829 | doi = 10.1002/cpa.20132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brainshark.com/brainshark/brainshark.net/portal/title.aspx?pid=zCdz10BfTRz0z0 M. Davenport, "The Fundamentals of Compressive Sensing", SigView, April 12, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
A common goal of the engineering field of [[signal processing]] is to reconstruct a signal from a series of sampling measurements. In general, this task is impossible because there is no way to reconstruct a signal during the times that the signal is not measured. Nevertheless, with prior knowledge or assumptions about the signal, it turns out to be possible to perfectly reconstruct a signal from a series of measurements (acquiring this series of measurements is called [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]]). Over time, engineers have improved their understanding of which assumptions are practical and how they can be generalized.

An early breakthrough in signal processing was the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]]. It states that if a [[Real number|real]] signal's highest frequency is less than half of the sampling rate (or less than the sampling rate, if the signal is [[Complex number|complex]]), then the signal can be reconstructed perfectly by means of [[Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula|sinc interpolation]]. The main idea is that with prior knowledge about constraints on the signal's frequencies, fewer samples are needed to reconstruct the signal.

Around 2004, [[Emmanuel Candès]], [[Justin Romberg]], [[Terence Tao]], and [[David Donoho]] proved that given knowledge about a signal's [[sparsity]], the signal may be reconstructed with even fewer samples than the sampling theorem requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/cpa.20124|url=http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~candes/papers/StableRecovery.pdf|title=Stable signal recovery from incomplete and inaccurate measurements|year=2006|last1=Candès|first1=Emmanuel J.|last2=Romberg|first2=Justin K.|last3=Tao|first3=Terence|journal=Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics|volume=59|issue=8|pages=1207–1223|arxiv=math/0503066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Donoho&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/TIT.2006.871582|title=Compressed sensing|year=2006|last1=Donoho|first1=D.L.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|volume=52|issue=4|pages=1289–1306}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is the basis of compressed sensing.

==History==
Compressed sensing relies on [[Lp space|L1]] techniques, which several other scientific fields have used historically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0ZCyAOBrUtA/TTwqLEeLvdI/AAAAAAAAEXI/7S0_SnWoC0E/s1600/l1-minimization.JPG List of L1 regularization ideas] from Vivek Goyal, Alyson Fletcher, Sundeep Rangan, [http://www.math.uiuc.edu/%7Elaugesen/imaha10/goyal_talk.pdf The Optimistic Bayesian: Replica Method Analysis of Compressed Sensing]&lt;/ref&gt; In statistics, the [[least squares]] method was complemented by the [[Lp norm|&lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt;-norm]], which was introduced by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]]. Following the introduction of [[linear programming]] and [[George Dantzig|Dantzig]]'s [[simplex algorithm]], the &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt;-norm was used in [[computational statistics]]. In statistical theory, the &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt;-norm was used by [[George W. Brown (academic)|George W. Brown]] and later writers on [[median-unbiased estimator]]s. It was used by Peter J. Huber and others working on [[robust statistics]]. The &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt;-norm was also used in signal processing, for example, in the 1970s, when seismologists constructed images of reflective layers within the earth based on data that did not seem to satisfy the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|Nyquist–Shannon criterion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1511/2009.79.276 |title = The Best Bits |year = 2009 |last1 = Hayes |first1 = Brian |journal = American Scientist |volume = 97 |issue = 4 |pages = 276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used in [[matching pursuit]] in 1993, the [[Lasso regression|LASSO estimator]] by [[Robert Tibshirani]] in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/lasso.html |first = Robert |last = Tibshirani |title = Regression shrinkage and selection via the lasso |journal = [[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B]] |volume = 58 |issue = 1 |pages = 267–288 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[basis pursuit]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;"Atomic decomposition by basis pursuit", by Scott Shaobing Chen, David L. Donoho, Michael, A. Saunders. SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing&lt;/ref&gt;  There were theoretical results describing when these algorithms recovered sparse solutions, but the required type and number of measurements were sub-optimal and subsequently greatly improved by compressed sensing.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

At first glance, compressed sensing might seem to violate [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|the sampling theorem]], because compressed sensing depends on the [[Sparse matrix|sparsity]] of the signal in question and not its highest frequency. This is a misconception, because the sampling theorem guarantees perfect reconstruction given sufficient, not necessary, conditions. A sampling method fundamentally different from classical fixed-rate sampling cannot "violate" the sampling theorem. Sparse signals with high frequency components can be highly under-sampled using compressed sensing compared to classical fixed-rate sampling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~candes/papers/ExactRecovery.pdf |title = Robust Uncertainty Principles: Exact Signal Reconstruction from Highly Incomplete Fourier Information |year = 2006 |last1 = Candès |first1 = Emmanuel J. |last2 = Romberg |first2 = Justin K. |last3 = Tao |first3 = Terence |journal = IEEE Trans.

==Method==

===Underdetermined linear system===
An [[underdetermined system]] of linear equations has more unknowns than equations and generally has an infinite number of solutions. The figure below shows such an equation system &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}=D\mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt; where we want to find a solution for &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Underdetermined equation system.svg|mini|200px|alt=Underdetermined linear equation system|Underdetermined linear equation system]]

In order to choose a solution to such a system, one must impose extra constraints or conditions (such as smoothness) as appropriate. In compressed sensing, one adds the constraint of sparsity, allowing only solutions which have a small number of nonzero coefficients. Not all underdetermined systems of linear equations have a sparse solution. However, if there is a unique sparse solution to the underdetermined system, then the compressed sensing framework allows the recovery of that solution.

===Solution / reconstruction method===
Compressed sensing takes advantage of the redundancy in many interesting signals—they are not pure noise. In particular, many signals are [[sparse matrix|sparse]], that is, they contain many coefficients close to or equal to zero, when represented in some domain.&lt;ref&gt;Candès, E.J., &amp; Wakin, M.B., ''An Introduction To Compressive Sampling'', IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, V.21, March 2008 [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4472240&amp;isnumber=4472102]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same insight used in many forms of [[lossy compression]].

Compressed sensing typically starts with taking a weighted linear combination of samples also called compressive measurements in a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] different from the basis in which the signal is known to be sparse. The results found by  [[Emmanuel Candès]], [[Justin Romberg]],  [[Terence Tao]] and  [[David Donoho]], showed that the number of these compressive measurements can be small and still contain nearly all the useful information. Therefore, the task of converting the image back into the intended domain involves solving an underdetermined [[matrix equation]] since the number of compressive measurements taken is smaller than the number of pixels in the full image. However, adding the constraint that the initial signal is sparse enables one to solve this underdetermined [[system of linear equations]].

The least-squares solution to such problems is to minimize the [[L2 norm|&lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; norm]]—that is, minimize the amount of energy in the system. This is usually simple mathematically (involving only a [[matrix multiplication]] by the [[pseudo-inverse]] of the basis sampled in). However, this leads to poor results for many practical applications, for which the unknown coefficients have nonzero energy.

To enforce the sparsity constraint when solving for the underdetermined system of linear equations, one can minimize the number of nonzero components of the solution. The function counting the number of non-zero components of a vector was called the [[L0 norm|&lt;math&gt;L^0&lt;/math&gt; "norm"]] by David Donoho{{refn|group=note|The quotation marks served two warnings.  First, the number-of-nonzeros &lt;math&gt;L^0&lt;/math&gt;-"norm" is not a proper [[F-space|F-norm]], because it is not continuous in its scalar argument: ''nnzs''(α''x'') is constant as α approaches zero. Unfortunately, authors now neglect the quotation marks and [[abuse of terminology|abused terminology]]—clashing with the established use of the &lt;math&gt;L^0&lt;/math&gt; norm for the space of measurable functions (equipped with an appropriate metric) or for the [[F-space|space]] of sequences with [[F-space|F–norm]] &lt;math&gt;(x_n) \mapsto \sum_n{2^{-n} x_n/(1+x_n)}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Rolewicz. ''Metric Linear Spaces''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}.

[[Emmanuel Candès|Candès]] et al. proved that for many problems it is probable that the [[L1 norm|&lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt; norm]] is equivalent to the [[L0 norm|&lt;math&gt;L^0&lt;/math&gt; norm]], in a technical sense: This equivalence result allows one to solve the &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt; problem, which is easier than the &lt;math&gt;L^0&lt;/math&gt; problem. Finding the candidate with the smallest &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt; norm can be expressed relatively easily as a [[linear program]], for which efficient solution methods already exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acm.caltech.edu/l1magic/ L1-MAGIC is a collection of MATLAB routines]&lt;/ref&gt;  When measurements may contain a finite amount of noise, [[basis pursuit denoising]] is preferred over linear programming, since it preserves sparsity in the face of noise and can be solved faster than an exact linear program.

==== Motivation and Applications ====

===== Role of TV regularization =====
[[Total variation]] can be seen as a [[non-negative]] [[real number|real]]-valued [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] defined on the space of [[real number|real-valued]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]s (for the case of functions of one variable) or on the space of [[integrable function]]s (for the case of functions of several variables). For signals, especially, [[total variation]] refers to the integral of the absolute [[gradient]] of the signal. In signal and image reconstruction, it is applied as [[total variation regularization]] where the underlying principle is that signals with excessive details have high total variation and that removing these details, while retaining important information such as edges, would reduce the total variation of the signal and make the signal subject closer to the original signal in the problem.

For the purpose of signal and image reconstruction, &lt;math&gt;l1&lt;/math&gt; minimization models are used. Other approaches also include the least-squares as has been discussed before in this article. These methods are extremely slow and return a not-so-perfect reconstruction of the signal. The current CS Regularization models attempt to address this problem by incorporating sparsity priors of the original image, one of which is the total variation (TV). Conventional TV approaches are designed to give piece-wise constant solutions. Some of these include (as discussed ahead) - constrained l1-minimization which uses an iterative scheme. This method, though fast, subsequently leads to over-smoothing of edges resulting in blurred image edges.&lt;ref name = "EPTV" /&gt; TV methods with iterative re-weighting have been implemented to reduce the influence of large gradient value magnitudes in the images. This has been used in [[Tomography|computed tomography]] (CT) reconstruction as a method known as edge-preserving total variation. However, as gradient magnitudes are used for estimation of relative penalty weights between the data fidelity and regularization terms, this method is not robust to noise and artifacts and accurate enough for CS image/signal reconstruction and, therefore, fails to preserve smaller structures.

Recent progress on this problem involves using an iteratively directional TV refinement for CS reconstruction.&lt;ref name = "Orientation and directional refinement" /&gt; This method would have 2 stages: the first stage would estimate and refine the initial orientation field - which is defined as a noisy point-wise initial estimate, through edge-detection, of the given image. In the second stage, the CS reconstruction model is presented by utilizing directional TV regularizer. More details about these TV-based approaches - iteratively reweighted l1 minimization, edge-preserving TV and iterative model using directional orientation field and TV- are provided below.

==== Existing approaches ====

[[File:IRLS.png|thumb|iteratively reweighted l1 minimization method for CS]]
In the CS reconstruction models using constrained &lt;math&gt;l_{1}&lt;/math&gt; minimization, larger coefficients are penalized heavily in the &lt;math&gt;l_{1}&lt;/math&gt; norm. It was proposed to have a weighted formulation of &lt;math&gt;l_{1}&lt;/math&gt; minimization designed to more democratically penalize nonzero coefficients. An iterative algorithm is used for constructing the appropriate weights.&lt;ref name="Iteration"&gt;Lange, K.: Optimization, Springer Texts in Statistics. Springer, New York (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Each iteration requires solving one &lt;math&gt;l_{1}&lt;/math&gt; minimization problem by finding the local minimum of a concave penalty function that more closely resembles the &lt;math&gt;l_{0}&lt;/math&gt; norm. An additional parameter, usually to avoid any sharp transitions in the penalty function curve, is introduced into the iterative equation to ensure stability and so that a zero estimate in one iteration does not necessarily lead to a zero estimate in the next iteration. The method essentially involves using the current solution for computing the weights to be used in the next iteration.

====== Advantages and disadvantages ======
Early iterations may find inaccurate sample estimates, however this method will down-sample these at a later stage to give more weight to the smaller non-zero signal estimates. One of the disadvantages is the need for defining a valid starting point as a global minimum might not be obtained every time due to the concavity of the function. Another disadvantage is that this method tends to uniformly penalize the image gradient irrespective of the underlying image structures. This causes over-smoothing of edges, especially those of low contrast regions, subsequently leading to loss of low contrast information. The advantages of this method include: reduction of the sampling rate for sparse signals; reconstruction of the image while being robust to the removal of noise and other artifacts; and use of very few iterations. This can also help in recovering images with sparse gradients.

In the figure shown below, '''P1''' refers to the first-step of the iterative reconstruction process, of the projection matrix '''P''' of the fan-beam geometry, which is constrained by the data fidelity term. This may contain noise and artifacts as no regularization is performed. The minimization of '''P1''' is solved through the conjugate gradient least squares method. '''P2''' refers to the second step of the iterative reconstruction process wherein it utilizes the edge-preserving total variation regularization term to remove noise and artifacts, and thus improve the quality of the reconstructed image/signal. The minimization of '''P2''' is done through a simple gradient descent method. Convergence is determined by testing, after each iteration, for image positivity, by checking if &lt;math&gt;f^{k-1} = 0&lt;/math&gt; for the case when &lt;math&gt;f^{k-1} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; (Note that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; refers to the different x-ray linear attenuation coefficients at different voxels of the patient image).

[[File:Edge preserving TV.png|thumb|Flow diagram figure for edge preserving total variation method for compressed sensing]]
This is an iterative CT reconstruction algorithm with edge-preserving TV regularization to reconstruct CT images from highly undersampled data obtained at low dose CT through low current levels (milliampere).  In order to reduce  the imaging dose, one of the approaches used is to reduce the number of x-ray projections acquired by the scanner detectors. However, this insufficient projection data which is used to reconstruct the CT image can cause streaking artifacts. Furthermore, using these insufficient projections in standard TV algorithms end up making the problem under-determined and thus leading to infinitely many possible solutions. In this method, an additional penalty weighted function is assigned to the original TV norm. This allows for easier detection of sharp discontinuities in intensity in the images and thereby adapt the weight to store the recovered edge information during the process of signal/image reconstruction. The parameter &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; controls the amount of smoothing applied to the pixels at the edges to differentiate them from the non-edge pixels. The value of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is changed adaptively based on the values of the histogram of the gradient magnitude so that a certain percentage of pixels have gradient values larger than &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. The edge-preserving total variation term, thus, becomes sparser and this speeds up the implementation. A two-step iteration process known as forward-backward splitting algorithm is used.&lt;ref name = "Forward-Backward"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Combettes | first1 = P | last2 = Wajs | first2 = V | year = 2005 | title = Signal recovery by proximal forward-backward splitting | url = | journal = Multiscale Model Simul | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 1168–200 | doi=10.1137/050626090}}&lt;/ref&gt; The optimization problem is split into two sub-problems which are then solved with the conjugate gradient least squares method&lt;ref name="CGLS"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hestenes | first1 = M | last2 = Stiefel | first2 = E | year = 1952 | title = Methods of conjugate gradients for solving linear systems | url = | journal = J Res Natl Bur Stand | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 409–36 | doi=10.6028/jres.049.044}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the simple gradient descent method respectively. The method is stopped when the desired convergence has been achieved or if the maximum number of iterations is reached.

===== Advantages and disadvantages =====
Some of the disadvantages of this method are the absence of smaller structures in the reconstructed image and degradation of image resolution. This edge preserving TV algorithm, however, requires fewer iterations than the conventional TV algorithm.&lt;ref name ="EPTV" /&gt; Analyzing the horizontal and vertical intensity profiles of the reconstructed images, it can be seen that there are sharp jumps at edge points and negligible, minor fluctuation at non-edge points. Thus, this method leads to low relative error and higher correlation as compared to the TV method. It also effectively suppresses and removes any form of image noise and image artifacts such as streaking.

=====Iterative model using a directional orientation field and directional total variation&lt;ref name="Orientation and directional refinement"&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6588871&lt;/ref&gt;=====
To prevent over-smoothing of edges and texture details and to obtain a reconstructed CS image which is accurate and robust to noise and artifacts, this method is used. First, an initial estimate of the noisy point-wise orientation field of the image &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{d}&lt;/math&gt;, is obtained. This noisy orientation field is defined so that it can be refined at a later stage to reduce the noise influences in orientation field estimation.A coarse orientation field estimation is then introduced based on structure tensor which is formulated as:&lt;ref name="Structure tensor"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brox | first1 = T. | last2 = Weickert | first2 = J. | last3 = Burgeth | first3 = B. | last4 = Mrázek | first4 = P. | year = 2006 | title = Nonlinear structure tensors | url = | journal = Image Vis. Comput | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 41–55 | doi=10.1016/j.imavis.2005.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt; J_\rho(\nabla I_{\sigma}) = G_\rho * (\nabla I_{\sigma} \otimes \nabla I_{\sigma}) = \begin{pmatrix}J_{11} &amp; J_{12}\\J_{12} &amp; J_{22}\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt; J_\rho &lt;/math&gt; refers to the structure tensor related with the image pixel point (i,j) having standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; refers to the Gaussian kernel &lt;math&gt;(0, \rho ^2)&lt;/math&gt; with standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; refers to the manually defined parameter for the image &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; below which the edge detection is insensitive to noise. &lt;math&gt;\nabla I_{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; refers to the gradient of the image &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\nabla I_{\sigma} \otimes \nabla I_{\sigma})&lt;/math&gt; refers to the tensor product obtained by using this gradient.

The structure tensor obtained is convolved with a Gaussian kernel &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to improve the accuracy of the orientation estimate with &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; being set to high values to account for the unknown noise levels. For every pixel (i,j) in the image, the structure tensor J is a symmetric and positive semi-definite matrix. Convolving all the pixels in the image with &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, gives orthonormal eigen vectors  ω and υ of the &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; matrix. ω points in the direction of the dominant orientation having the largest contrast and υ points in the direction of the structure orientation having the smallest contrast.  The orientation field coarse initial estimation &lt;math&gt;\hat{d}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\hat{d}&lt;/math&gt; = υ.  This estimate is accurate at strong edges. However, at weak edges or on regions with noise, its reliability decreases.

To overcome this drawback, a refined orientation model is defined in which the data term reduces the effect of noise and improves accuracy while the second penalty term with the L2-norm is a fidelity term which ensures accuracy of initial coarse estimation.

This orientation field is introduced into the directional total variation optimization model for CS reconstruction through the equation: &lt;math&gt;min_\Chi\lVert \nabla \Chi \bullet d \rVert _{1} + \frac{\lambda}{2}\ \lVert Y - \Phi\Chi \rVert ^2_{2}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\Chi&lt;/math&gt; is the objective signal which needs to be recovered. Y is the corresponding measurement vector, d is the iterative refined orientation field and &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the CS measurement matrix. This method undergoes a few iterations ultimately leading to convergence.&lt;math&gt;\hat{d}&lt;/math&gt; is the orientation field approximate estimation of the reconstructed image &lt;math&gt;X^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; from the previous iteration (in order to check for convergence and the subsequent optical performance, the previous iteration is used). For the two vector fields represented by  &lt;math&gt;\Chi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Chi \bullet d&lt;/math&gt; refers to the multiplication of respective horizontal and vertical vector elements of &lt;math&gt;\Chi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; followed by their subsequent addition. These equations are reduced to a series of convex minimization problems which are then solved with a combination of variable splitting and augmented Lagrangian (FFT-based fast solver with a closed form solution) methods.&lt;ref name = "Orientation and directional refinement" /&gt; It (Augmented Lagrangian) is considered equivalent to the split Bregman iteration which ensures convergence of this method.  The orientation field, d is defined as being equal to &lt;math&gt;(d_{h}, d_{v})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;d_{h},  d_{v}&lt;/math&gt; define the horizontal and vertical estimates of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Augmented Lagrangian.png|thumb|right|Augmented Lagrangian method for orientation field and iterative directional field refinement models]]

The Augmented Lagrangian method for the orientation field,  &lt;math&gt;min_\Chi\lVert \nabla \Chi \bullet d \rVert _{1} + \frac{\lambda}{2}\ \lVert Y - \Phi\Chi \rVert ^2_{2}&lt;/math&gt;,  involves initializing &lt;math&gt;d_{h}, d_{v}, H, V&lt;/math&gt; and then finding the approximate minimizer of &lt;math&gt;L_{1}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to these variables.  The Lagrangian multipliers are then updated and the iterative process is stopped when convergence is achieved. For the iterative directional total variation refinement model, the augmented lagrangian method involves initializing &lt;math&gt;\Chi, P, Q, \lambda_{P}, \lambda_{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="TV"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldluecke | first1 = B. | last2 = Strekalovskiy | first2 = E. | last3 = Cremers | first3 = D. | last4 = Siims | first4 = P.-T.

Here, &lt;math&gt;H, V, P, Q&lt;/math&gt; are newly introduced variables where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\nabla d_{h}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\nabla d_{v}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\nabla \Chi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;P \bullet d&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{H}, \lambda_{V}, \lambda_{P}, \lambda_{Q}&lt;/math&gt; are the Lagrangian multipliers for &lt;math&gt;H, V, P, Q&lt;/math&gt;. For each iteration, the approximate minimizer of &lt;math&gt;L_{2}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to variables (&lt;math&gt;\Chi, P, Q&lt;/math&gt;) is calculated. And as in the field refinement model, the lagrangian multipliers are updated and the iterative process is stopped when convergence is achieved.

For the orientation field refinement model, the Lagrangian multipliers are updated in the iterative process as follows:

&lt;math&gt;(\lambda_{H})^k = (\lambda_{H})^{k-1} +  \gamma_{H}(H^k - \nabla (d_{h})^k)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(\lambda_{V})^k = (\lambda_{V})^{k-1} +  \gamma_{V}(V^k - \nabla (d_{v})^k)&lt;/math&gt;

For the iterative directional total variation refinement model, the Lagrangian multipliers are updated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;(\lambda_{P})^k = (\lambda_{P})^{k-1} +  \gamma_{P}(P^k - \nabla (\Chi)^k)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(\lambda_{Q})^k = (\lambda_{Q})^{k-1} +  \gamma_{Q}(Q^k - P^{k} \bullet d)&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{H}, \gamma_{V}, \gamma_{P}, \gamma_{Q}&lt;/math&gt; are positive constants.

=====Advantages and disadvantages=====

Based on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) metrics and known ground-truth images for testing performance, it is concluded that iterative directional total variation has a better reconstructed performance than the non-iterative methods in preserving edge and texture areas. The orientation field refinement model plays a major role in this improvement in performance as it increases the number of directionless pixels in the flat area while enhancing the orientation field consistency in the regions with edges.

The field of compressive sensing is related to several topics in signal processing and computational mathematics, such as [[underdetermined system|underdetermined linear-system]]s, [[group testing]], heavy hitters, [[sparse coding]], [[multiplexing]], sparse sampling, and finite rate of innovation.

Conventional CS reconstruction uses sparse signals (usually sampled at a rate less than the Nyquist sampling rate) for reconstruction through constrained &lt;math&gt;l_{1}&lt;/math&gt; minimization. One of the earliest applications of such an approach was in reflection seismology which used sparse reflected signals from band-limited data for tracking changes between sub-surface layers.&lt;ref name="Seismic sparse signals"&gt;Taylor, H.L., Banks, S.C., McCoy, J.F. "Deconvolution with the 1 norm. ''Geophysics'' 44(1), 39–52 (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;  When the LASSO model came into prominence in the 1990s as a statistical method for selection of sparse models,&lt;ref name="LASSO"&gt;Tibshirani, R. "Regression shrinkage and selection via the lasso. ''J. R. Stat. Soc. B'' 58(1), 267–288 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; this method was further used in computational harmonic analysis for sparse signal representation from over-complete dictionaries. Some of the other applications include incoherent sampling of radar pulses. The work by ''Boyd et al.''&lt;ref name = "Original source for IRLS" /&gt; has applied the LASSO model- for selection of sparse models- towards analog to digital converters (the current ones use a sampling rate higher than the Nyquist rate along with the quantized Shannon representation). This would involve a parallel architecture in which the polarity of the analog signal changes at a high rate followed by digitizing the integral at the end of each time-interval to obtain the converted digital signal.

===Photography===
Compressed sensing is used in a mobile phone camera sensor. The approach allows a reduction in image acquisition energy per image by as much as a factor of 15 at the cost of complex decompression algorithms; the computation may require an off-device implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Camera Chip Captures Only What It Needs|author=David Schneider|journal=IEEE Spectrum|date=March 2013|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/optoelectronics/camera-chip-makes-alreadycompressed-images|accessdate=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compressed sensing addresses the issue of high scan time by enabling faster acquisition by measuring fewer Fourier coefficients. This produces a high-quality image with relatively lower scan time. Another application (also discussed ahead) is for CT reconstruction with fewer X-ray projections. Compressed sensing, in this case, removes the high spatial gradient parts - mainly, image noise and artifacts. This holds tremendous potential as one can obtain high-resolution CT images at low radiation doses (through lower current-mA settings).&lt;ref name="MRI"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Figueiredo | first1 = M. | last2 = Bioucas-Dias | first2 = J.M. | last3 = Nowak | first3 = R.D. | year = 2007 | title = Majorization–minimization algorithms for wavelet-based image restoration | url = | journal = IEEE Trans.

===Network tomography===
Compressed sensing has showed outstanding results in the application of [[network tomography]] to [[network management]]. [[Network delay]] estimation and [[network congestion]] detection can both be modeled as underdetermined [[System of linear equations|systems of linear equations]] where the coefficient matrix is the network routing matrix. Moreover, in the [[Internet]], network routing matrices usually satisfy the criterion for using compressed sensing.&lt;ref&gt;[Network tomography via compressed sensing|http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/funlab/Publications/2010/CS-Tomo.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shortwave-infrared cameras===
Commercial shortwave-infrared cameras based upon compressed sensing are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=InView web site|url=http://www.inviewcorp.com/products |website=inviewcorp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cameras have light sensitivity from 0.9&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] to 1.7&amp;nbsp;µm, which are wavelengths invisible to the human eye.

===Aperture synthesis in radio astronomy===
In the field of [[radio astronomy]], compressed sensing has been proposed for deconvolving an interferometric image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/395/3/1733|Compressed sensing imaging techniques for radio interferometry]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the [[CLEAN (algorithm)|Högbom CLEAN algorithm]] that has been in use for the deconvolution of radio images since 1974, is similar to compressed sensing's matching pursuit algorithm.

===Transmission electron microscopy===
Compressed sensing combined with a moving aperture has been used to increase the acquisition rate of images in a [[transmission electron microscopy|transmission electron microscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevens|first1=Andrew|last2=Kovarik|first2=Libor|last3=Abellan|first3=Patricia|last4=Yuan|first4=Xin|last5=Carin|first5=Lawrence|last6=Browning|first6=Nigel D.|title=Applying compressive sensing to TEM video: a substantial frame rate increase on any camera|journal=Advanced Structural and Chemical Imaging|date=13 August 2015|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s40679-015-0009-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scanning transmission electron microscopy|scanning mode]], compressive sensing combined with random scanning of the electron beam has enabled both faster acquisition and less electron dose, which allows for imaging of electron beam sensitive materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kovarik|first1=L.|last2=Stevens|first2=A.|last3=Liyu|first3=A.|last4=Browning|first4=N.

'''Conservation and restoration of metals''' is the activity devoted to the protection and [[Historic preservation|preservation]] of historical (religious, artistic, technical and ethnographic) and [[archaeological]] objects made partly or entirely of [[metal]]. In it are included all activities aimed at preventing or slowing deterioration of items, as well as improving accessibility and readability of them as objects of [[cultural heritage]]. Despite the fact that metals are generally considered as the relatively permanent and stable materials, in contact with the environment they deteriorate gradually, some faster and some much slower. This applies especially to archaeological finds.

It is very important that a conservator of metals has [[knowledge]] of basic [[metalworking]] techniques, history of metalwork, [[history of art]], [[archaeology]], [[corrosion]] of metals, [[scientific]] [[research]] methods, [[theory]] and [[ethics]] of conservation-restoration.

[[File:PerseusSignoriaStatue.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Perseus with the Head of Medusa]]'' in the Loggia dei Lanzi gallery on the edge of the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in Florence; picture taken after the statue's cleaning and restoration.]]
An essential cause of deterioration is corrosion of metal objects or object deterioration by interaction with the environment. As the most influential factors of deterioration of historical objects should be pointed out as the relative humidity and air pollution while in archaeological objects a crucial role has composition, depth, humidity and amount of gasses in the soil. In cases of marine or fresh water finds the most important factors of decay are the amount and composition of soluble salts, water depth, amount of dissolved gases, the direction of water currents and the role of both microscopic and macroscopic living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;

==Deterioration of materials associated with metals==
Associated materials deteriorate depending on the origin whether they are organic or inorganic materials. Organic materials usually fail in a relatively short period of time, primarily due to biodegradation. With inorganic materials are these processes considerably longer and more complex. Amount of gases, humidity, depth and composition of soil are very important. In case of salty and sweet water finds essential are amount of gases dissolved in water, depth of water, direction of currents, and microscopic and macroscopic living organisms.

==Metals conservation planning==

===Basics===
As with the conservation and restoration works on any other material,  here are the basic tenets of conservation-restoration based on the quality of execution and the best possible preservation of cultural, historical and technological identity and integrity of objects. Minimal intervention, reversibility and repeatability of preferred treatment are essential, as well as the possibility of easy identification of restored parts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elsevierdirect.com/brochures/shreir/PDF/Shreirs_PreservationOfMetallicCulturalHeritage.pdf Accessed 16.01.2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently non-toxic nature of used materials and procedures becomes important too, both in relation to objects and conservator-restorer as a performer, but also in relation to the environment.

===Research===
Nowadays scientific research is an integral part of the metals conservation treatment, at least in highly developed countries.

====Identification of metals and alloys====
*Simple methods - visual examination, spot tests, specific gravity
*Scientific methods - [[X-ray fluorescence]], [[X-ray Diffraction|XRD]], [[Particle-induced X-ray emission]], [[LIBS]], [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]], electrochemical techniques, [[metallography]]

====Identification of corrosion processes and products====
*Simple method - visual examination, spot tests
*[[Oddy test|The Oddy test]] - for copper, silver, and lead
*Scientific methods - xrd, SEM, metallography

====Identification of materials associated with metals====
*Simple methods - visual examination, spot tests, specific gravity
*Scientific methods - xrf, [[chromatography]],
Raman spectroscopy

====Identification of technology used to produce objects====
*Simple methods - visual examination
*Scientific methods - metallography, [[x-ray radiography]], [[x-ray computed tomography]]

===Decision making===
In preparing the strategy of the metals conservation project interdisciplinary approach to the same is essential. It implies the participation of as many experts as is possible, as a minimum,  we can take curator (archaeologist, historian, art historian), scientists specialized for corrosion of metallic objects of cultural heritage and the conservator - restorer.

===Documentation===
Systematic and well-managed documentation is today an essential prerequisite for quality executed conservation and restoration treatments, including documentation of the state of objects before, during and after treatment. Identification of materials and procedures used to produce object and the results of any scientific research must be part of documentation too. Last but not least- an integral part of the documentation must be a recommendation for further care of object.

===Ethics and ethical problems in metals conservation===
The ethical concept of conservation of metal objects in principle is the same as those in other fields of conservation-restoration of cultural heritage.

But there are several specific problems that can only be found in the conservation of metals - problem of heat treatment of archaeological objects, and the problem of radical restoration of historic, mostly technical, but also architectonic objects too.

While in the first case problem is primarily in the destruction of valuable scientific data, in case of the technical, the architectural, and somewhat less often, historical objects problem is that a radically restored items just simulate the original appearance of the object, and so in some ways that objects can be considered even as, more or less successful fakes, which only superficially simulate long-lost or never existing state of object.

According to the above-mentioned, whenever it is possible real historical substance must be preserved. Thoroughly documented and technically professionally executed restoration of objects, must be avoided because such objects must be seen only as freshly painted surrogates of authentic historic substance.

Ethical problems connected with conservation of sacred metallic heritage objects can be included too.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J.C.: On restoring sacred objects http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/thompson/sacred/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==

===Preventive conservation===
{{main article|Collections care}}
Metallic heritage objects are sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, air pollution and exposure to light and ultraviolet light. They must be protected in a controlled environment where such variables are maintained within a range of damage-limiting levels.

Preventive conservation, also known as collections care, is an important element of museum policy. It is an essential responsibility of members of the museum profession to create and maintain a protective environment for the collections in their care, whether in store, on display, or in transit. A museum should carefully monitor the condition of collections to determine when an artifact requires conservation work and the services of a qualified conservator.

===Interventive conservation===

====Cleaning====
[[Image:HorsesSaintMark1.jpg|right|thumb|Conservation of gilt bronze [[Horses of Saint Mark]], ([[Venice]]).]]

The most common procedure in conservation and restoration of metals is the cleaning process.  This process can be distinguish between mechanical, chemical, electrochemical, ultrasonic, plasma and laser cleaning. In principle, it is aimed at removing dirt and corrosion products from the surface of a metal object.  In many cases archaeology objects only can be cleaned mechanically.

====Structural consolidation====
Aimed at strengthening of the physical structure of the object, and correcting the shape of the object.
*Mechanical joining - riveting / tab and slot / overlapping / screws
*Soldering - soft / hard
*Welding - oxyacetilene / electric arc / TIG / tack / laser / plasma
*Gluing/Cementing
*Reconstructions -in original material - in polymers - *[[3D printing]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/organisation/faculties/content/faculteit-der-geesteswetenschappen/shared-content/events/workshops/2013/10/masterclass-3d.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213222342/http://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/organisation/faculties/content/faculteit-der-geesteswetenschappen/shared-content/events/workshops/2013/10/masterclass-3d.html# |date=2013-12-13 }} Retrieved 13.12.2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reconstruction of missing parts or surface decoration====
In certain cases, metals conservator must re-create the lost parts of objects or restore original surface decoration. This approach is accurate only if we have an exact documentation or photographs of items in a complete, currently non-existent state that we want to return.

New parts must be clearly and visibly marked and at least they must be minimally different from the original historic material.

If needed, those parts must be easily and completely removable from the object, and with methods which will not harm it.

Only cyanide or hexchromate free processes must be used.

Only worn-out spots can be replated.

Replating of entire object must be avoided.

====Stabilization====
Focused on slowing of deterioration of objects – in the case of archaeology objects the thorough removal or blocking of chloride salts. In case of the historical objects it is focused on the use of corrosion inhibitors, conversion coatings, rust converters or eventually oxygen free storage.
*Chloride removal (chemical processes, electrochemical processes)
*Corrosion inhibitors ([[benzotriazole]], [[tannin]])
*[[Rust converter]]s˙
*[[Conversion coating]]s ([[phosphate conversion coating]]s, phosphate/tannin, etc.)
*Oxygen free storage

'''Renaissance Wax{{main article|Renaissance Wax}}

is a brand of microcrystalline wax polish that is widely encountered in antique restoration and museum curation. Although not appropriate for all materials, it is known to and used by almost every collection. It is also used as a primary finish for cabinetry and furniture. Renaissance wax is also used by reenactors of historic swordsmanship to protect armour and weapons. It is widely recognised that this substance is more protective and longer lasting than oil, especially for swords and helmets that are frequently touched by human hands.

To quote a typical commercial supplier of conservation materials, it is used, to revive and protect valuable furniture, leather, paintings, metals, marble, onyx, ivory etc. Freshens colours and imparts a soft sheen&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picreator.co.uk/articles/3_renaissance_wax.htm{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation of materials associated with metals===

====Precious and semi precious stones====
In principle do not use any solvent, but only distilled water, or a 10% solution of soapwort plant (''Saponaria officinalis''). You must be Especially careful when working on porous gemstones like [[malachite]], [[opal]], [[chalcedony]], [[chrysoprase]], [[agate]], [[carnelian]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[jade]] and [[turquoise]]. Special attention requires gemstones combined with colored metal foils, in this case, the liquid does not come into contact with the foil. Do not use ultrasonic cleaning.

====Enamels====
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of glass objects}}

====Niello====
Nielloed items can be cleaned only mechanically, never try to use chemical cleaning. Black pigment mixed with Paraloid B 72 can be used for reconstruction of missing parts.
Concentrated solution of Paraloid B 72 or B 67 (soluble in white spirit) can be used as reversible glue.

====Amber====
Do not clean with solvents, do not use ultrasound, you can use only distilled water, or a mixture of water and ethanol (add up to 0.5% crosslinker).&lt;ref&gt;Nikitin, MK; Meljnikova, EP Himija v restavracii, Leningrad 1990th str.268&lt;/ref&gt; Variety of waxy resin mixtures can be used as glue, depending on the color of amber. You can use 10% solution of Canada balsam in toluene&lt;ref&gt;Huck, J; Bleck, RD Chemikalien und Rezepte, Weimar 1990th&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological material can be cleaned only mechanically.
Soaking in liquid paraffin can be used to consolidate and improve color of amber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ingolstadt.de/stadtmuseum/scheuerer/ausstell/bernst04.htm archaeological site access 23.03.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to one Korean article for consolidation can be used Paraloid B 67 dissolved in xylene (proved more stable than white spirit, usual solvent for B 67)&lt;ref&gt;Ham, CH, Shin, B. Amber Artifact Consolidation Case Study: Impact of Organic Solvents on Amber Artifacts, Abstracts from the 37th Annual Conference of the Canadian Association for Conservation of Cultural Property, Winnipeg 2011th&lt;/ref&gt; According to one American article as ideal consolidant and adhesive can be used Regalrez 1126&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276594058_Conservation_of_amber_at_the_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_New_York_USA_Regalrez_R_1126_as_a_consolidant_and_adhesive_for_amber_and_copal  Accessed 15.11.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Artifacts must be Protected from strong light and high temperatures, low humidity and oscillations in humidity, in the case of metal/amber objects do not to use corrosion inhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cr.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-17.pdf Access to the site Aus Bruchstücken rekonstruiert Ein Bernsteinkästchen der Gothaer Kunstkammer&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oriental lacquer - urushi====
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of lacquerware}}

Requires a completely different approach than western lacquers. May be found on the Japanese arms and armour. The best approach – leave it to expert for oriental lacquer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/urushi.html Accessed 10/02/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic37-01-009_indx.html Accessed 2.10.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http: / / art-con.ru/node/651. Accessed 04.12.2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Mixture of 6-8% polyvinyl alcohol and chalk can be used as filling material(Rhoplex WS 24 can be used too).&lt;ref&gt;http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic37-01-009_2.html Accessed 18.11.2012 page.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese conservators use traditional techniques, but as Urushi causes allergic reactions, these methods are not recommended. Clean it with an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as white or mineral spirits. Distilled water or saliva (moistened cottonwool swabs) can caused discoloration and should be avoided by the inexperienced: pH is crucial. Keep objects in rooms with controlled humidity and temperature, preferably about 50% RH, and protect them from UV radiation.

Can be cleaned with cotton wool swabs soaked in distilled water, or with a mixture of distilled water and ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;Nikitin, M.K.; Melynikova, E.P. Himiya v restavracii, Leningrad 1990., p.272.&lt;/ref&gt;
Do not use ultrasound. Avoid any contact with acids.

====Pearls====
Historical objects can be cleaned using a mixture of 70% ethanol and 30% weak ammonia water (1%). To remove the surface layer that has lost luster you can use 3–5% EDTA, after that step rinse with distilled water, and then with 80% ethanol, then with 90% ethanol, and finally with pure ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;Nikitin, M.K.; Melynikova, E.P. Himiya v restavracii, Leningrad 1990., p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;
Do not use ultrasound.
Archaeological finds must be treated as soon as possible, preferably after excavation, you can clean them only mechanically, then consolidate with 2% Paraloid B 72, in the case of dry findings (first saturate with solvent in which it is dissolved), in case of damp or wet findings use Rhoplex WS 24 (acrylic dispersion).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/reports/shell_objects.pdf Accessed 17.10.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Somewhat More recent Russian literature recommends use of bleached beeswax dissolved in white spirit or medical benzine as protective coating. Fish glue mixed with water and alcohol (7/3), with addition of 1% katamine AB as biocide can be used as glue. Nonionogenic detergent 2-3% in a mixture of water and alcohol can be used for cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;http://art-con.ru/node/4473 Accessed 29.11.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Avoid prolonged contact with water, sudden changes in temperature and relative humidity, including strong light or contact with acidic or alkaline solutions (soap water too).

====Tortoiseshell====

====Jet====
You can clean it with cottonwool swabs soaked in distilled water or soapwort extract (''Saponaria officinalis'', 100 grams of dried root per 1 liter of boiling water). Archaeological material can be cleaned only mechanically. Wax/resin mixtures or concentrated solution of Paraloid B 72 (or B 67) can be 
used as glue for archaeology objects.&lt;ref&gt;Nikitin, M.K.; Melynikova, E.P. Himiya v restavracii, Leningrad 1990., p.269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage of metallic heritage objects==
The items should be stored in rooms that are protected from polluted air, dust, ultraviolet radiation, and excessive relative humidity - ideal values are temperature of 16-20&amp;nbsp;°C and up to 40% (35-55% according to recent Canadian Conservation Institute recommendations) relative humidity, noting that if metal is combined with organic materials, relative humidity should not be below 45%. Archaeological objects must be stored in rooms (or plastic boxes) with very low relative humidity, or in the case of particularly valuable items in the chambers with nitrogen or argon. Copper or copper alloy objects with active corrosion up to 35% RH. Iron objects with active corrosion 12-15% RH. Shelves in the storerooms must be of stainless steel or chlorine and acetate free plastic or powder coated steel. Wood and wood-based products ([[Particle board]], [[plywood]]) must be avoided. Also do not use [[rubber]], [[felt]] or [[wool]]. When you are handling metal objects, always wear clean cotton gloves. Lighting levels must be kept below 300 lux (up to 150 lux in case of lacquered or painted objects, up to 50 lux in case of objects with light sensitive materials)&lt;ref&gt;Budija Goran:Čišćenje, zaštita i održavanje umjetničkih predmeta i starina od metala, version December 2010., Zagreb,

[[File:Mount Storm Power Plant, Areial.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Storm Lake]] is a {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} cooling pond for a power plant in [[Grant County, West Virginia]].]]
A '''cooling pond''' is a man-made body of [[water]] primarily formed for the purpose storing heated water and/or supplying [[cooling water]] to a nearby [[power plant]] or industrial facility such as a [[petroleum refining|petroleum refinery]], [[pulp and paper mill]], [[chemical plant]], [[steel mill]] or [[smelter]].

==Overview==
Cooling ponds are used where sufficient land is available, as an alternative to [[cooling tower]]s or discharging of heated water to a nearby [[river]] or [[coastal waters|coastal bay]], a process known as “once-through cooling.” The latter process can cause [[thermal pollution]] of the receiving waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Environmental Science |last1=Mongillo |first1=John F. |last2=Zierdt-Warshaw |first2=Linda |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]] |location=Rochester, NY |isbn=978-1-57356-147-1 |page=93 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Water in Environmental Planning |last1=Dunne |first1=Thomas |last2=Leopold |first2=Luna B. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1978 |publisher=[[W.H. Freeman]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7167-0079-1 |page=722 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooling ponds are also sometimes used with [[HVAC|air conditioning systems]] in large buildings as an alternative to cooling towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic Refrigeration and Air Conditioning |last=Ananthanarayanan |first=P.N. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location= |isbn=978-0-07-049500-5 |page=218 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pond receives [[thermal energy]] in the water from the plant’s [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensers]] during the process of energy production and the thermal energy is then dissipated mainly through [[evaporation]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, D.C. (1970). [http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=9100H0DE.txt “An Engineering-Economic Study of Cooling Pond Performance.”] Document no. 16130DFX0570. Water Pollution Control Research Series. p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, Harlan (2010). [http://www.brighthub.com/engineering/mechanical/articles/64576.aspx “Steam Power Plant Condenser Cooling—Part 1: Introduction to Alternatives.”] brighthub.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the water has cooled in the pond, it is reused by the plant. New water is added to the system (“make-up” water) to replace the water lost through evaporation.

A 1970 cooling pond research study done by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] stated cooling ponds as having a lower overall electrical cost than [[Cooling tower|cooling towers]] while providing the same benefits. They also concluded that a cooling pond will work optimally within 5 degrees Fahrenheit of natural water temperature with an area encompassing approximately 4 acres per megawatt of dissipated thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springerreference_32156|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake Anna is a cooling pond in Virginia, which provides cooling water for the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station. This pond has recreational uses such as  fishing, swimming, boating, camping, and picnicking as well as being a cooling pond for the nuclear plant. Chernobyl's cooling pond has abundant wildlife, despite the radiation present in the area.

The '''cosmos''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|k|ɒ|z|m|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|-|m|oʊ|s}}) is the [[universe]]. Using the word ''cosmos'' rather than the word ''universe'' implies viewing the universe as a complex and orderly [[system]] or entity; the opposite of [[Chaos (cosmogony)| chaos]].&lt;ref&gt;

The cosmos, and our understanding of the reasons for its existence and significance, are studied in [[cosmology]] - a very broad discipline covering any scientific, religious, or philosophical contemplation of the cosmos and its nature, or reasons for existing. Religious and philosophical approaches may include in their concepts of the cosmos various spiritual entities or other matters deemed to exist outside our physical universe.

== Etymology ==
The [[philosopher]] [[Pythagoras]] first used the term ''cosmos'' ({{lang-grc|κόσμος}}) for the order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]], ''Pyth.'', β 59; [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] ΙΙ 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anaxagoras]] further introduced the concept of a Cosmic Mind (''[[Nous]]'') ordering all things (Aetius Ι 3.5).&lt;/ref&gt; The term became part of modern language in the 19th century when geographer–polymath [[Alexander von Humboldt]] resurrected the use of the word from the ancient Greek, assigned it to his five-volume treatise, ''[[Kosmos (Humboldt)|Kosmos]]'', which influenced modern and somewhat [[holism|holistic]] perception of the universe as one interacting [[entity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MfgpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe|last=Humboldt|first=Alexander von|last2=Paul|first2=Benjamin Horatio|last3=von)|first3=Wilhelm Humboldt (Freiherr|last4=Dallas|first4=William Sweetland|date=1860|publisher=Harper &amp; brothers|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humansandnature.org/introducing-humboldt-s-cosmos-article-26.php|title=Introducing Humboldt's Cosmos {{!}} Center for Humans &amp; Nature|website=Center for Humans &amp; Nature|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cosmology ==
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|right|The Ancient and [[Medieval]] cosmos as depicted in [[Peter Apian]]'s ''Cosmographia'' (Antwerp, 1539).]]
[[Cosmology]] is the study of the cosmos, and in its broadest sense covers a variety of very different approaches: scientific, religious and philosophical. All cosmologies have in common an attempt to understand the implicit order within the whole of being. In this way, most religions and [[philosophy|philosophical]] systems have a cosmology.

When ''cosmology'' is used without a qualifier, it often signifies physical cosmology, unless the context makes clear that a different meaning is intended.

=== Physical cosmology ===
{{main|Cosmology}}
Physical cosmology (often simply described as 'cosmology') is the scientific study of the universe, from the beginning of its physical existence. It includes speculative concepts such as a multiverse, when these are being discussed. In [[physical cosmology]], the term ''cosmos'' is often used in a technical way, referring to a particular [[spacetime]] continuum within a (postulated) [[multiverse]]. Our particular cosmos, the [[observable universe]], is generally capitalized as ''the Cosmos''. 

In physical cosmology, the uncapitalized term '''cosmic''' signifies a subject with a relationship to the universe, such as 'cosmic time' (time since the [[Big Bang]]), '[[cosmic rays]]' (high energy particles or radiation detected from [[outer space|space]]), and '[[cosmic microwave background]]' (microwave radiation detectable from all directions in space).

According to [[wikisource:Author:Charles Peter Mason|Charles Peter Mason]] in [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Sir William Smith]] ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'' (1870, see book screenshot for full quote), [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] described the universe.&lt;ref name=CPM&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir William Smith|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|year=1870|url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/304/|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philolaus-and-Philomelus-Pythagorean-Book.jpg|thumb|upright|Excerpt from [[Philolaus]] Pythagoras book, (Charles Peter Mason, 1870)]]
{{quote|
It appears, in fact, from this, as well as from the extant fragments, that the first book (from [[Philolaus]]) of the work contained a general account of the origin and arrangement of the universe. The second book appears to have been an exposition of the nature of numbers, which in the Pythagorean theory are the essence and source of all things. (p. 305)}}

=== Philosophical cosmology ===
{{main|Philosophical cosmology}}
Cosmology is a branch of [[metaphysics]] that deals with the nature of the universe, a theory or doctrine describing the natural order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cosmology|title=Definition of "Cosmology"|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic definition of Cosmology is the science of the origin and development of the universe. In modern astronomy the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] is the dominant postulation.

=== Religious cosmology ===
{{see also|Religious cosmology|Hellenistic philosophy and Christianity|Orphism (religion)}}

In [[theology]], the cosmos is the [[Creation myth|created]] heavenly bodies (sun, moon, planets, and [[fixed stars]]). In [[Christian theology]], the word is also used synonymously with ''[[aeon|aion]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concerning Aion and Aionios|url=http://www.saviourofall.org/Writings/aion.html|publisher=Saviour of All Fellowship|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to "worldly life" or "this world" or "this age" as opposed to the [[afterlife]] or [[world to come]].

The 1870 book ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' noted&lt;ref name=CPM /&gt;
:[[Thales]] dogma that water is the origin of things, that is, that it is that out of which every thing arises, and into which every thing resolves itself, Thales may have followed Orphic cosmogonies, while, unlike them, he sought to establish the truth of the assertion. Hence, Aristotle, immediately after he has called him the originator of philosophy brings forward the reasons which Thales was believed to have adduced in confirmation of that assertion; for that no written development of it, or indeed any book by ''Thales'', was extant, is proved by the expressions which Aristotle uses when he brings forward the doctrines and proofs of the [[Miletus|Milesian]]. (p. 1016)

:[[Plato]], describes the idea of the good, or the Godhead, sometimes ''teleologically'', as the ultimate purpose of all conditioned existence; sometimes ''cosmologically'', as the ultimate operative cause; and has begun to develop the ''cosmological'', as also the physico-theological proof for the being of God; but has referred both back to the idea of the Good, as the necessary presupposition to all other ideas, and our cognition of them. (p. 402)

The book ''The Works of Aristotle'' (1908, p.&amp;nbsp;80 ''Fragments'') mentioned&lt;ref name=Aristotle1908&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofaristotle12arisuoft|title=The Works of Aristotle|year=1908|author=Aristotle|author2=Ross, W. D. (William David), 1877|author3=Smith, J. A. (John Alexander), 1863-1939|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Aristotle says the poet ''Orpheus'' never existed; the Pythagoreans ascribe this Orphic poem to a certain ''Cercon'' (see [[Cercops]]).

[[Bertrand Russell]] (1947) noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|title=History of Western Philosophy|year=1947|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Orphics were an ascetic sect; wine, to them, was only a symbol, as, later, in the Christian sacrament. The intoxication that they sought was that of "enthusiasm," of union with the god. They believed themselves, in this way, to acquire mystic knowledge not obtainable by ordinary means. This mystical element entered into Greek philosophy with Pythagoras, who was a reformer of Orphism as Orpheus was a reformer of the religion of Dionysus. From Pythagoras Orphic elements entered into the philosophy of Plato, and from Plato into most later philosophy that was in any degree religious.

'''Cultural archive''' is a term associated with social [[Wendy James (anthropologist)|anthropologist Wendy James]] referencing the repository of knowledge found in everyday interactions that individuals reference to validate their existence in the world. This term was coined during James' research of the [[Uduk people|Uduk]] people of [[Sudan]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1VFOOI_XrX0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20listening%20ebony&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20listening%20ebony&amp;f=false|title=The Listening Ebony: Moral Knowledge, Religion, and Power Among the Uduk of Sudan|last=James|first=Wendy|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198234166|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is most commonly associated with [[Culture and Imperialism]], the 1993 collection of essays by postcolonial theorist [[Edward Said]]. The term first appears in reference to Rudyard Kipling's Kim and Said suggests the cultural archive is a major site where investments in imperial conquest are developed. These archives include "narratives, histories, and travel tales."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1NmWrG9PgCQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=culture%20and%20imperialism&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=culture%20and%20imperialism&amp;f=false|title=Culture and Imperialism|last=Said|first=Edward W.|date=2012-10-24|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780307829658|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said emphasizes the role of the Western imperial project in the disruption of cultural archives, and theorizes that disciplines such as comparative literature, English, and anthropology can be directly linked to the concept of empire. 

[[Gloria Wekker]]'s 2016 book ''White Innocence: Paradoxes of Colonialism and Race'' utilizes a scavenger methodology by "work[ing] with interviews, watching TV and reading novels, analyzing email correspondence..." in order to develop a clear understanding of the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] cultural archive. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFrgCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=gloria%20wekker%20white%20innocence&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=gloria%20wekker%20white%20innocence&amp;f=false|title=White Innocence: Paradoxes of Colonialism and Race|last=Wekker|first=Gloria|date=2016-04-29|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822374565|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8420">The '''Deal–Grove model''' mathematically describes the growth of an [[oxide]] layer on the surface of a material.  In particular, it is used to predict and interpret [[thermal oxidation]] of [[silicon]] in [[semiconductor device fabrication]].&lt;ref name="slo"&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Liu| first1=M.| last2= Peng |first2=J.| display-authors= etal |title=  Two-dimensional modeling of the self-limiting oxidation in silicon and tungsten nanowires | journal= Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Letters  | year= 2016 |  volume=6 | issue=5 | pages=195–199 | url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306273009_Two-dimensional_modeling_of_the_self-limiting_oxidation_in_silicon_and_tungsten_nanowires | doi= 10.1016/j.taml.2016.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The model was first published in 1965 by Bruce Deal and [[Andrew Grove]], of [[Fairchild Semiconductor]].

== Physical assumptions ==
[[File:Deal-Grove.png|right|The three phenomena of oxidation, as described in the article text]]
The model assumes that [[redox|oxidation]] [[chemical reaction|reaction]] occurs at the interface between the oxide layer and the substrate material, rather than between the oxide and the ambient [[gas]].&lt;ref name="slo"/&gt;  Thus, it considers three phenomena that the oxidizing species undergoes, in this order:

# It [[diffusion|diffuses]] from the bulk of the ambient gas to the surface.
# It diffuses through the existing oxide layer to the oxide-substrate interface.
# It reacts with the substrate.

The model assumes that each of these stages proceeds at a rate proportional to the oxidant's concentration.  In the first case, this means [[Henry's law]]; in the second, [[Fick's law of diffusion]]; in the third, a [[Rate equation#First-order reactions|first-order reaction]] with respect to the oxidant.  It also assumes [[steady state]] conditions, i.e. that transient effects do not appear.

== Results ==
Given these assumptions, the [[flux]] of oxidant through each of the three phases can be expressed in terms of concentrations, material properties, and temperature.

:&lt;math&gt;J_{gas} = h_g (C_g- C_s)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_{oxide} = D_{ox} \frac{C_s- C_i}{x}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_{reacting} = k_i C_i&lt;/math&gt;

By setting the three fluxes equal to each other, each may be found.  In turn, the growth rate may be found readily from the oxidant reaction flux.

:&lt;math&gt;J_{gas} = J_{oxide} = J_{reacting} = \frac {C_g}{\frac{1}{k_i}+\frac{x}{D_{ox}}+\frac{1}{h_g}}&lt;/math&gt;

In practice, the ambient gas (stage 1) does not limit the reaction rate, so this part of the equation is often dropped.  This simplification yields a simple quadratic equation for the oxide thickness.  For oxide growing on an initially bare substrate, the thickness ''X&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' at time ''t'' is given by the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{X_o^2}{B} + \frac{X_o}{B/A} - \tau&lt;/math&gt;
where the constants &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; encapsulate the properties of the reaction and the oxide layer, respectively, and the constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; takes into account any initial oxide thickness present. These constants are given as:
:&lt;math&gt;A=2 D_{ox} (\frac{1}{k_i} + \frac{1}{h_g})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B= \frac {2D_{ox} C_s}{N_i} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \frac{X_o^2 + A X_o}{B} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; C_s = H P_g &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; H  &lt;/math&gt; being the gas solubility parameter of the [[Henry's law]] and &lt;math&gt; P_g &lt;/math&gt; is the partial pressure of the diffusing gas. &lt;Math&gt; N_i &lt;/math&gt; denotes the oxidant molecules/unit volume needed to produce a unit volume of the oxide.

Solving the quadratic equation for ''X&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' yields:
:&lt;math&gt;X_o(t) = \frac{-A+\sqrt{{A^2}+4(B)(t+\tau)}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the short and long time limits of the above equation reveals two main modes of operation:
:&lt;math&gt;t+\tau \ll \frac{A^2}{4B} \Rightarrow X_o(t) = \frac{B}{A}(t+\tau)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t+\tau \gg \frac{A^2}{4B} \Rightarrow X_o(t) = \sqrt{B(t+\tau)}&lt;/math&gt;

Because they appear in these equations, the quantities ''B'' and ''B/A'' are often called the ''quadratic'' and ''linear reaction rate constants''.  They depend exponentially on temperature, like this:
:&lt;math&gt;B = B_0 e^{-E_A/kT}; \quad B/A = (B/A)_0 e^{-E_A/kT} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E_A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[activation energy]] and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann Constant]] in eV.  &lt;math&gt;E_A&lt;/math&gt; differs from one equation to the other.  The following table lists the values of the four parameters for single-[[crystal]] silicon under conditions typically used in industry (low [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]], [[atmosphere (unit)|atmospheric]] [[pressure]]).  The linear rate constant depends on the orientation of the crystal (usually indicated by the [[Miller indices]] of the crystal plane facing the surface).  The table gives values for &lt;100&gt; and &lt;111&gt; silicon.

== Validity for silicon ==
The Deal–Grove model works very well for single-crystal silicon under most conditions.  However, experimental data shows that very thin oxides (less than about 25 nanometres) grow much more quickly in &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; than the model predicts. In silicon nanostructures (e.g. [[Silicon Nanowire]]s) this rapid growth is generally followed by diminishing oxidation kinetics in a process known as self-limiting oxidation, necessitating a modification of the Deal–Grove model.&lt;ref name="slo"/&gt;

If the oxide grown in a particular oxidation step will significantly exceed 25&amp;nbsp;nm, a simple adjustment accounts for the aberrant growth rate.  The model yields accurate results for thick oxides if, instead of assuming zero initial thickness (or any initial thickness less than 25&amp;nbsp;nm), we assume that 25&amp;nbsp;nm of oxide exists before oxidation begins.  However, for oxides near to or thinner than this threshold, more sophisticated models must be used.

In the 1980s, it became obvious that an update to the Deal-Grove Model would be necessary to model the aforementioned thin oxides (self-limiting cases). One such approach more accurately models thin oxides is the Massoud Model from 1985 [1]. The Massoud Model is analytical and based on parallel oxidation mechanisms. It changes the parameters of Deal-Grove Model to better model the initial oxide growth with the addition of rate enhancement terms. 

Deal-Grove also fails for polycrystalline silicon ("poly-silicon").  First, the random orientation of the crystal grains makes it difficult to choose a value for the linear rate constant.  Second, oxidant molecules diffuse rapidly along grain boundaries, so that poly-silicon oxidizes more rapidly than single-crystal silicon.

[[Dopant]] atoms strain the silicon lattice, and make it easier for silicon atoms to bond with incoming oxygen.  This effect may be neglected in many cases, but heavily doped silicon oxidizes significantly faster.  The pressure of the ambient gas also affects oxidation rate.

== Research ==
DID is distinctive for its interest in rising middle income developing countries (like the [[BRIC]]s) as well as in social, political, and economic phenomena in conjunction with policy related questions of those fast-growing developing countries. The department’s mission is “to explore the sources of success in emerging economies as well as understand the major development challenges they continue to face”.

DID’s areas of research are ‘[[Inclusive growth|inclusive development]]’ on the one hand and ‘national development’ on the other hand. Within these two broad themes, it works on five research clusters:

* Political Institutions in Emerging Economies
* Poverty, Inequality and the New Middle Classes in Emerging Economies
* Natural Resources and Emerging Economies
* Gender Relations in Emerging Economies
* Private Sector Development in Emerging Economies

DID publishes a [[working paper]] series and has links to various external organisations including institutions like the UK [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] and the UK [[Department for International Development]], the [[British Academy]], the [[European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes|European Association of Development Institutes]], the UK [[Development Studies Association]], the US [[Council on Foreign Relations]], [[UNDP]], the [[United Nations University]], the [[WHO]], the [[World Bank]], and various international non-governmental and research organisations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4561">{{For|the baseball player|Don Hopkins (baseball)}}

'''Don Hopkins''' is an [[artist]] and [[programmer]] specializing in [[human computer interaction]] and [[computer graphics]] and an alumnus of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]&lt;ref name="resume"&gt;[http://www.donhopkins.com/home/resume.html Resume for Donald Edward Hopkins]&lt;/ref&gt; and a former member of the [[University of Maryland Human–Computer Interaction Lab]].

He inspired [[Richard Stallman]], who described him as a "very imaginative fellow", to use the term [[copyleft]]. He coined [[Deep Crack]] as the name of the [[EFF DES cracker]].&lt;ref name="resume" /&gt; He ported the ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]'' computer game to several versions of [[Unix]] and developed a multi player version of ''SimCity'' for X11, did much of the core programming of ''[[The Sims]]'', and developed robot control and personality simulation software for [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]]'s Stupid Fun Club.

He developed and refined [[pie menus]] for many platforms and applications including [[window manager]]s, [[Emacs]], ''SimCity'' and ''The Sims'', and published a frequently cited paper about pie menus at CHI'88 with John Raymond Callahan, [[Ben Shneiderman]] and [[Mark Weiser]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=57182 An empirical comparison of pie vs. linear menus]&lt;/ref&gt; He has published many [[free software]] and [[open source]] implementations of pie menus for [[X Window System|X10]], X11, [[NeWS]], [[Tcl/tk]], [[ScriptX]], [[ActiveX]], [[JavaScript]], [[OpenLaszlo]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[OLPC]], and also proprietary implementations for ''The Sims'' and the [[Palm Pilot]].

Hopkins also wrote demonstrations and programming examples of the ScriptX multimedia scripting language created by the Apple/IBM research spinoff [[Kaleida Labs]], developed various [[OpenLaszlo]] applications and components, and is a [[hacker artist]] known for his [http://www.art.net/Studios/Hackers/Hopkins/Don/art/cell.html artistic cellular automata]. He is also known for having written a chapter "The X-Windows Disaster" on [[X Window System]] in the book [[The UNIX-HATERS Handbook]].

==Micropolis==
{{main|Micropolis (software)}}

Recently Hopkins, supported by [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], adapted ''SimCity'' for the [[One Laptop per Child|OLPC]] [[OLPC XO|XO-1 laptop]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/node/131 History and Future of OLPC SimCity / Micropolis]&lt;/ref&gt; The current version includes pie menus and is explained in depth in a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpKhh10K-j0 video] released by Hopkins.

Since its primary objective is education, the OLPC project is looking not just for games, but for tools that enable kids to program their own games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Game_development Game development - OLPC]&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins programmed Micropolis to make it easy to extend in many interesting ways. He added functionality to let kids create new disasters and agents (like the monster, tornado, helicopter and train), and program them like in many of the other games on the XO. The goals of deeply integrating ''SimCity'' with OLPC's [[Sugar (software)|Sugar]] user interface are to focus on education and accessibility for younger kids, as well as motivating and enabling older kids to learn programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/taxonomy_menu/4/49/63/65 SimCity for OLPC: Applying Papert's Ideas About Constructionist Education and Teaching Kids to Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Sims''==
''[[The Sims]]'' is a virtual reality video game developed by [[Electronic Arts]]. The games are known for their very loose guidelines and no specific user goals. They allow the users to simply exist in the virtual world they create. Don Hopkins became involved in ''The Sims'' after he worked at [[Sun Microsystems]].&lt;ref name="resume" /&gt; ''The Sims'' were a theme in his work since then and he has contributed to much of the design and conceptual development of the game. He was hired to convert ''The Sims'' for Unix. He implemented the usage of pie menus to the game so that users could efficiently carry out actions in the game world.

===Renewable energy===
[[File:Reverse osmosis desalination plant.JPG|thumb|A view across a [[reverse osmosis]] [[desalination]] plant in [[Nepal]].]]
[[Renewable energy]] is the [[energy]] that can be replenished easily. For years we have been using sources such as [[wood]], [[sun]], [[water]], etc. for means for producing energy. Energy that can be produced by natural objects like wood, sun, wind, etc. is considered to be renewable.

===Water purification===
[[Water purification]]: The whole idea/concept of having dirt/germ/pollution free water flowing throughout the environment. Many other phenomena lead from this concept of purification of water.

===Sewage treatment===
[[Sewage treatment]] is conceptually similar to water purification. Sewage treatments are very important as they purify water per levels of its pollution. The most polluted water is not used for anything, and the least polluted water is supplied to places where water is used affluently. It may lead to various other concepts of environmental protection, sustainability etc.&lt;ref&gt;“Sewage Treatment”.

===eGain forecasting===
Egain forecasting is a method using forecasting technology to predict the future [[weather]]'s impact on a building.&lt;ref&gt;Taesler, R. (1990/91) Climate and Building Energy Management. Energy and Buildings, Vol. 15-16, pp 599 - 608.&lt;/ref&gt; By adjusting the heat based on the weather forecast, the system eliminates redundant use of heat, thus reducing the energy consumption and the emission of [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ip.com/patent/US6098893 United States Patent 6098893] Comfort control system incorporating weather forecast data and a method for operating such a system (Inventor Stefan Berglund)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy conservation===
[[Energy conservation]] is the utilization of devices that require smaller amounts of energy in order to reduce the consumption of electricity. Reducing the use of electricity causes less fossil fuels to be burned to provide that electricity.

==Alternative and clean power==
[[File:Roadster 2.5 charging.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]] was the first all-electric sports car for sale and in serial production. It can completely recharge from the electrical grid in 4 to 48 hours depending on the outlet used.]]
Principles:
*[[Green syndicalism]]
*[[Sustainability]]
*[[Sustainable design]]
*[[Sustainable engineering]]

Concerns over pollution and greenhouse gases have spurred the search for sustainable alternatives to our current fuel use. For example, biogas from anaerobic digestion of plant waste can be stored to produce heat or electricity. The global reduction of greenhouse gases requires the adoption of energy conservation as well as sustainable generation. That environmental harm reduction involves global changes such as:

* reducing air pollution and methane from biomass 
* virtually eliminating fossil fuels for vehicles, heat and electricity, left in the ground. 
* wide spread use of public transport, battery and fuel cell vehicles 
* more wind/solar/water generated electricity 
* reducing peak demands with carbon taxes and time of use pricing.

Since fuel used by industry and transportation account for the majority of world demand, by investing in conservation and efficiency (using less fuel), pollution and greenhouse gases from these two sectors can be reduced around the globe. Advanced energy efficient [[electric motor]] (and [[electric generator]]) technology that are cost effective to encourage their application, such as [[brushless wound-rotor doubly fed electric machine|variable speed generators]] and [[efficient energy use]], can reduce the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that would otherwise be introduced to the atmosphere, if electricity were generated using fossil fuels.

==Education==
Courses aimed at developing graduates with specific skills in environmental systems or environmental technology are becoming more common and fall into three broads classes:
*''[[Environmental Engineering|Environmental Engineering or Environmental Systems]]'' courses oriented towards a civil engineering approach in which structures and the landscape are constructed to blend with or protect the environment;
*''[[Environmental chemistry]]'', ''sustainable chemistry'' or ''environmental chemical engineering'' courses oriented towards understanding the effects (good and bad) of chemicals in the environment.  Such awards can focus on mining processes, pollutants and commonly also cover biochemical processes;
*''Environmental technology'' courses oriented towards producing electronic, electrical or electrotechnology graduates capable of developing devices and artefacts able to monitor, measure, model and control environmental impact, including monitoring and managing energy generation from renewable sources, and developing novel energy generation technologies.

[[File:Concorde on Bristol.jpg|thumb|[[Concorde]] in its final flight. The extremely high fineness ratio of the fuselage is evident.]]
[[File:Questair Venture.jpg|thumb|right|[[Questair Venture]], with an egg-shaped, very-low-fineness-ratio fuselage]]

In [[naval architecture]] and [[aerospace engineering]], the '''fineness ratio''' is the ratio of the length of a body to its maximum width. Shapes that are short and wide have a low fineness ratio, those that are long and narrow have high fineness ratios. Aircraft that spend time at [[supersonic]] speeds, e.g. the [[Concorde]], generally have high fineness ratios.

At speeds below [[critical mach]], one of the primary forms of drag is [[skin friction]]. As the name implies, this is drag caused by the interaction of the airflow with the aircraft's skin.  To minimize this drag, the aircraft should be designed to minimize the exposed skin area, or "wetted surface". One solution to this problem is constructing an "egg shaped" fuselage, for example as used on the home-built [[Questair Venture]].

Theoretical ideal fineness ratios in subsonic aircraft are typically found at about 6:1, however this may be compromised by other design considerations such as seating or freight size requirements. Because a higher fineness fuselage can have reduced tail surfaces, this ideal ratio can practically be increased to 8:1.&lt;ref name="GBooksf"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=_FBLtC3qpr4C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=fineness+ratio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=fineness%20ratio&amp;f=false|title = Airplane Design, Part 3|accessdate = 14 June 2016|last = Roskam|first = Jan|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most aircraft have fineness ratios significantly greater than this, however. This is often due to the competing need to place the tail control surfaces at the end of a longer [[moment arm]] to increase their effectiveness. Reducing the length of the fuselage would require larger controls, which would offset the drag savings from using the ideal fineness ratio. An example of a high-performance design with an imperfect fineness ratio is the [[Lancair]]. In other cases, the designer is forced to use a non-ideal design due to outside factors such as seating arrangements or cargo pallet sizes. Modern [[airliner]]s often have fineness ratios much higher than ideal, a side effect of their cylindrical cross-section which is selected for strength, as well as providing a single width to simplify seating layout.

As an aircraft approaches the [[speed of sound]], [[shock wave]]s form on areas of greater curvature. These shock waves radiate away energy that the engines must supply, energy that does not go into making the aircraft go faster. This appears to be a new form of drag—referred to as [[wave drag]]—which peaks at about three times the drag at speeds even slightly below the [[critical mach]]. In order to minimize the wave drag, the curvature of the aircraft should be kept to a minimum, which implies much higher fineness ratios. This is why high-speed aircraft have long pointed noses and tails, and cockpit canopies that are flush to the fuselage line.

More technically, the best possible performance for a supersonic design is typified by two "perfect shapes", the [[Sears-Haack body]] which is pointed at both ends, or the [[von Kármán ogive]], which has a blunt tail. Examples of the latter design include the [[Concorde]], [[F-104 Starfighter]] and [[XB-70 Valkyrie]], although to some degree practically every post-World War II [[interceptor aircraft]] featured such a design. Missile designers are even less interested in low-speed performance, and missiles generally have higher fineness ratios than most aircraft.

The introduction of aircraft with higher fineness ratios also introduced a new form of instability, [[inertial coupling]]. As the engines and cockpit moved away from the aircraft's [[center of mass]], the roll inertia of these masses grew to be able to overwhelm the power of the aerodynamic surfaces. A variety of methods are used to combat this effect, including oversized controls and [[stability augmentation system]]s.

The '''Florida Institute of Oceanography''' (FIO), located on the campus of the [[University of South Florida St. Petersburg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usfsp.edu/home/2016/04/22/florida-institute-of-oceanography-appoints-new-director/|title=Florida Institute of Oceanography Appoints New Director|date=2016-04-22|work=University of South Florida St. Petersburg|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an independent entity of the [[State University System of Florida]] that works collaboratively with 20 institutions and agencies from across the state that support marine research.

== Facilities ==
The FIO operates several smaller ships, as well as two research vessels. The flagship of the institute is R/V ''Weatherbird II,'' a 115-foot, 194-ton vessel, that was acquired and renovated in 2009, and soon made national headlines as one of the most active research vessels during the [[2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill|2010 Deep Horizon oil spill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ilovetheburg.com/rv-weatherbird-ii-a-st-pete-icon/|title=R/V Weatherbird II: A St. Pete Icon - I Love the Burg|website=ilovetheburg.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fio.usf.edu/vessel-fleet/rv-weatherbird-ii|title=R/V Weatherbird II {{!}} vessels {{!}} Florida Institute of Oceanography (FIO)|website=www.fio.usf.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017, FIO launched R/V ''W.T. Hogarth,'' a state of the art research vessel replacing the nearly 50-year-old R/V ''Bellows'' which had served as a floating laboratory for 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oceannews.com/news/science-technology/florida-institute-of-oceanography-new-research-vessel|title=Florida Institute of Oceanography New Research Vessel {{!}} Science &amp; Technology {{!}} News|last=|first=|date=30 May 2017|work=Ocean News &amp; Technology|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The R/V ''W.T. Hogarth'' was named after Dr. William T. Hogarth, who served as the director of the FIO until his retirement in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usfsp.edu/home/2016/04/22/florida-institute-of-oceanography-appoints-new-director/|title=Florida Institute of Oceanography Appoints New Director|date=2016-04-22|work=University of South Florida St. Petersburg|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1990, it co-manages the Keys Marine Laboratory on [[Long Key, Florida|Long Key]] with the [[Fish and Wildlife Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://keysmarinelab.org/about/history.html|title=History of the Keys Marine Lab|website=keysmarinelab.org|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The institute is governed by the FIO Council. Council members serve two-year terms and are active members of the Florida oceanographic science and education community. In addition to advising the FIO leadership regarding statewide collaboration in oceanographic science and education, the council’s key duty is to plan and align legislative budget requests with strategic priorities.

==Research==
Since the 1960s, the Florida Institute of Oceanography has unified marine science interests across Florida in the cause of understanding and stewardship of the coastal oceans. FIO has taken a leading national role in the scientific assessment of the impact of the ''[[Deepwater Horizon]]'' oil spill in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://stpeteinnovationdistrict.com/innovators/florida-institute-of-oceanography/|title=Florida Institute of Oceanography • St Pete Innovation District|work=St Pete Innovation District|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stpeteedc.com/top-companies/florida-institute-of-oceanography/|title=Florida Institute of Oceanography - St Pete EDC|work=St Pete EDC|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIO has emerged as a key research organization on the effects of the ''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill with the award of $10 million from the oil company BP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.83degreesmedia.com/inthenews/fio62210.aspx|title=Florida Institute Of Oceanography Receives $10 M Research Grant From BP|work=83Degrees|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an application process which began in June 2010, the FIO received more than 200 proposals from researchers totaling more than $60 million.

To apply for funding, scientists were asked to develop research proposals related to the following scientific priorities in spill research:

:Determine the properties, distribution, and extent of the oil spill and dispersants.
:Conduct baseline studies and impact assessments to provide the basis for long-term monitoring.
:Contribute to an integrated coastal and ocean observing system, and improve modeling capabilities for forecasting environmental impacts related to the oil spill.
:Develop and implement systems for data integration, synthesis, sharing, and dissemination.
:Develop and implement strategies to protect and restore habitats and species.
:Priority will be given to projects that are collaborative between two or more FIO members and/or the Northern Gulf Institute and Louisiana State University, which also received BP funding for initial research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22928">In '''flow chemistry''', a [[chemical reaction]] is run in a continuously flowing stream rather than in [[batch production]].  In other words, pumps move fluid into a tube, and where tubes join one another, the fluids contact one another.  If these fluids are reactive, a reaction takes place.  Flow chemistry is a well-established technique for use at a large scale when [[manufacturing]] large quantities of a given material.  However, the term has only been coined recently for its application on a [[laboratory]] scale.&lt;ref&gt;A. Kirschning (Editor): [http://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjoc/browse/singleSeries.htm?sn=4 Chemistry in flow systems] and [http://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjoc/browse/singleSeries.htm?sn=17 Chemistry in flow systems II] Thematic Series in the Open Access [[Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry]].&lt;/ref&gt; Often, [[microreactors]] are used.

== Batch vs. flow ==
===Comparing parameter definitions in Batch vs Flow===
*Reaction [[stoichiometry]]: In batch production this is defined by the concentration of [[chemical reagent]]s and their [[volumetric]] [[ratio]]. In flow this is defined by the [[concentration]] of reagents and the ratio of their flow rate.
*Residence time: In batch production this is determined by how long a vessel is held at a given temperature. In flow the volumetric [[Residence time distribution|residence time]] is given by the ratio of volume of the reactor and the overall flow rate, as most often, [[plug flow reactor]]s are used.

== Running flow reactions ==

Choosing to run a [[chemical reaction]] using flow chemistry, either in a [[microreactor]] or other mixing device offers a variety of pros and cons.

=== Advantages ===
* Reaction temperature can be raised above the solvent's [[boiling point]] as the volume of the laboratory devices is typically small. Typically, non-compressible fluids are used with no gas volume so that the [[expansion factor]] as a function of [[pressure]] is small.
* Mixing can be achieved within seconds at the smaller scales used in flow chemistry.
* Heat transfer is intensified. Mostly, because the area to volume ratio is large. As a result, endothermic and exothermic reactions can be thermostated easily and consistently. The temperature gradient can be steep, allowing efficient control over reaction time.
* Safety is increased: 
** Thermal mass of the system is dominated by the apparatus making thermal runaways unlikely. 
** Smaller reaction volume is also considered a safety benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Movsisyan|first=M.|last2=Delbeke|first2=E. I. P.|last3=Berton|first3=J. K. E. T.|last4=Battilocchio|first4=C.|last5=Ley|first5=S. V.|last6=Stevens|first6=C. V.|date=2016-09-12|title=Taming hazardous chemistry by continuous flow technology|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/cs/c5cs00902b|journal=Chemical Society Reviews|language=en|volume=45|issue=18|doi=10.1039/C5CS00902B|issn=1460-4744}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** The reactor operates under [[Steady-state (chemical engineering)|steady-state]] conditions. 
* Flow reactions can be automated with far less effort than batch reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Fitzpatrick|first = Daniel E.|last2 = Battilocchio|first2 = Claudio|last3 = Ley|first3 = Steven V.|date = 2016-02-19|title = A Novel Internet-Based Reaction Monitoring, Control and Autonomous Self-Optimization Platform for Chemical Synthesis|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.oprd.5b00313|journal = Organic Process Research &amp; Development|volume = 20|issue = 2|pages = 386–394|doi = 10.1021/acs.oprd.5b00313|issn = 1083-6160}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for unattended operation and experimental planning. By coupling the output of the reactor to a detector system, it is possible to go further and create an automated system which can sequentially investigate a range of possible reaction parameters (varying [[stoichiometry]], residence time and temperature) and therefore explore reaction parameters with little or no intervention. 
Typical drivers are higher yields/selectivities, less needed manpower or a higher safety level.

* [[multistep synthesis|Multi step reactions]] can be arranged in a continuous sequence.  This can be especially beneficial if intermediate compounds are unstable, toxic, or sensitive to air, since they will exist only momentarily and in very small quantities.
* The position along the flowing stream and reaction time point are directly related to one another. This means that it is possible to arrange the system such that further reagents can be introduced into the flowing reaction stream at a precise time point that is desired.
* It is possible to arrange a flowing system such that purification is coupled with the reaction. There are three primary techniques that are used:
** Solid phase scavenging&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Christopher D. |author2=Baxendale, Ian R. |author3=Tranmer, Geoffrey K. |author4=Baumann, Marcus |author5=Smith, Stephen C. |author6=Lewthwaite, Russell A. |author7=Ley, Steven V. |title=Tagged phosphine reagents to assist reaction work-up by phase-switched scavenging using a modular flow reactor|journal=Org. Biomol. Chem.|year=2007|volume=5|pages=1562–1568|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2007/OB/b703033a|accessdate=10 May 2013|doi=10.1039/b703033a}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** Chromatographic separation
** Liquid/Liquid Extraction
* Reactions which involve reagents containing dissolved gases are easily handled, whereas in batch a pressurized "bomb" reactor would be necessary.
* Multi phase liquid reactions (e.g. [[Phase-transfer catalyst|phase transfer catalysis]]) can be performed in a straightforward way, with high reproducibility over a range of scales and conditions.
* Scale up of a proven reaction can be achieved rapidly with little or no process development work, by either changing the reactor volume or by running several reactors in parallel, provided that flows are recalculated to achieve the same residence times.

=== Disadvantages ===
* Dedicated equipment is needed for precise continuous dosing (e.g. [[pumps]]), connections, etc.
* Start up and shut down procedures have to be established. 
* Scale up of ''micro effects'' such as the high area to volume ratio is not possible and [[economy of scale]] may not apply. Typically, a scale up leads to a dedicated plant.
* Safety issues for the storage of reactive material still apply.
The drawbacks have been discussed in view of establishing small scale continuous production processes by Pashkova and Greiner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pashkova | first1 = A. | last2 = Greiner | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1002/cite.201100037 | title = Towards Small-Scale Continuous Chemical Production: Technology Gaps and Challenges | journal = Chemie Ingenieur Technik | pages = n/a | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continuous flow reactors ==
[[Image:Coflore ACR.jpg|thumb|reaction stages of a multi-cell flow reactor]]

[[Continuous reactors]] are typically tube like and manufactured from non-reactive materials such as stainless steel, glass and polymers. Mixing methods include [[diffusion]] alone (if the diameter of the reactor is small e.g. &lt;1&amp;nbsp;mm, such as in [[microreactors]]) and [[static mixers]]. Continuous flow reactors allow good control over reaction conditions including heat transfer, time and mixing.

The residence time of the reagents in the reactor (i.e. the amount of time that the reaction is heated or cooled) is calculated from the volume of the reactor and the flow rate through it:

:Residence time = Reactor Volume / Flow Rate

Therefore, to achieve a longer residence time, reagents can be pumped more slowly and/or a larger volume reactor used.  Production rates can vary from nano liters to liters per minute.

Some examples of flow reactors are spinning disk reactors (Colin Ramshaw);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oxley|first=Paul|author2=Brechtelsbauer, Clemens |author3=Ricard, Francois |author4=Lewis, Norman |author5= Ramshaw, Colin |title=Evaluation of Spinning Disk Reactor Technology for the Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals|journal=Ind. Eng. Chem. Res.|year=2000|volume=39|issue=7|pages=2175–2182|url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/3004572/1740005940/name/%255BTKI%255D%2BEvaluation%2Bof%2BSpinning%2BDisk.pdf|accessdate=10 May 2013|doi=10.1021/ie990869u}}&lt;/ref&gt; spinning tube reactors; multi-cell flow reactors; oscillatory flow reactors; [[microreactors]]; hex reactors; and 'aspirator reactors'.
In an aspirator reactor a pump propels one reagent, which causes a reactant to be sucked in. This type of reactor was patented around 1941 by the Nobel company for the production of [[nitroglycerin]].

=== Flow reactor scale ===
The smaller scale of micro flow reactors or [[microreactors]] can make them ideal for process development experiments. Although it is possible to operate flow processes at a ton scale, [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] efficiency benefits from improved [[thermal transfer|thermal]] and [[mass transfer]] as well as mass transport.

Laboratory scale flow reactors are ideal systems for using gases, particularly those that are toxic or associated with other hazards.  The gas reactions that have been most successfully adapted to flow are [[hydrogenation]] and [[carbonylation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Csajági|first=Csaba |author2=Borcsek, Bernadett |author3=Niesz, Krisztián |author4=Kovács, Ildikó |author5=Székelyhidi, Zsolt |author6=Bajkó, Zoltán |author7=Ürge, László |author8=Darvas, Ferenc|title=High-Efficiency Aminocarbonylation by Introducing CO to a Pressurized Continuous Flow Reactor|journal=Org.

D. |author2=Ghaini, A. |author3=Constantinou, A. |author4=Cantu-Perez, A. |author5=Motherwell, W. B.  |author6=Gavriilidis, A.|title=Ozonolysis in Flow Using Capillary Reactors|journal=Org. Process Res. Dev.|date=23 June 2011|volume=15|issue=5|pages=989–996|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/op200036d|accessdate=10 May 2013|doi=10.1021/op200036d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons for the suitability of flow systems for hazardous gas handling are:
*Systems allow the use of a fixed bed [[catalyst]]. Combined with low solution concentrations, this allows all compound to be adsorbed to catalyst in the presence of gas
*Comparatively small amounts of gas are continually exhausted by the system, eliminating the need for many of the special precautions normally required for handling toxic and/or flammable gases
*The addition of pressure means that a far greater proportion of the gas will be in solution during the reaction than is the case conventionally
*The greatly enhanced mixing of the solid, liquid and gaseous phases allows the researcher to exploit the kinetic benefits of elevated temperatures without being concerned about the gas being displaced from solution

=== Photochemistry in combination with flow chemistry ===
Continuous flow photochemistry offers multiple advantages over batch [[photochemistry]]. Photochemical reactions are driven by the number of [[photon]]s that are able to activate molecules causing the desired reaction. The large surface area to volume ratio of a microreactor maximizes the illumination, and at the same time allows for efficient cooling, which decreases the [[Side product|thermal side products]].

=== Electrochemistry in combination with flow chemistry ===
Continuous flow electrochemistry like continuous photochemistry offers many advantages over analogous batch conditions. Electrochemistry like Photochemical reactions can be considered as a 'reagent-less' reactions. In an electrochemical reaction the reaction is facilitated by the number of electrons that are able to activate molecules causing the desired reaction. Continuous electrochemistry apparatus reduces the distance between the electrodes used to allow better control of the number of electrons transferred to the reaction media enabling better control and selectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Noyhouzer, T. and Mandler, D. (2013), A New Electrochemical Flow Cell for the Remote Sensing of Heavy Metals. Electroanalysis, 25: 109–115. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/elan.201200369/full doi:10.1002/elan.201200369]
&lt;/ref&gt; Recent developments in electrochemical flow-systems enabled the combination of reaction-oriented electrochemical flow systems with species-focused spectroscopy which allows complete analysis of reactions involving multiple electron transfer steps, as well as unstable intermediates.&lt;ref&gt;Noyhouzer T, Snowden M.E., Tefashe U.M., and Mauzeroll J., Modular Flow-Through Platform for Spectroelectrochemical Analysis,
Analytical Chemistry 2017 89 (10), 5246-5253 [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.6b04649 DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b04649]&lt;/ref&gt; These systems which are referred to as [[spectroelectrochemistry]](SEC) systems can enable the use of [[Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy|UV-vis]] as well as more complex methods such as [[electrochemiluminescence]](ECL). Furthermore, using electrochemistry allows another degree of flexibility since the use has control not only on the flow parameters and the nature of the electrochemical measurement itself, but also on the geometry or nature of the electrode (or electrodes in the case of an electrode array).&lt;ref&gt;Noyhouzer T,Perry SC,Vicente-Luis A, Hayes PL and Mauzeroll J., The Best of Both Worlds: Combining Ultramicroelectrode and Flow Cell Technologies, Journal of the Electrochemical Society 2018 165 (2), H10-15 [http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/165/2/H10.short DOI: 10.1149/2.0641802jes]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process development ===
The process development change from a serial approach to a parallel approach. In batch the chemist works first followed by the chemical engineer. In flow chemistry this changes to a parallel approach, where chemist and chemical engineer work interactively. Typically there is a plant setup in the lab, which is a tool for both. This setup can be either commercial or non commercial. The development scale can be small (ml/hour) for idea verification using a [[chip system]] and in the range of a couple of liters per hour for scalable systems like the [[flow miniplant]] technology. Chip systems are mainly used for liquid-liquid application while [[flow miniplant]] systems can deal with solids or viscous material.

=== Scale up of microwave reactions ===
Microwave reactors are frequently used for small scale batch chemistry. However, due to the extremes of temperature and pressure reached in a microwave it is often difficult to transfer these reactions to conventional non-microwave apparatus for subsequent development, leading to difficulties with scaling studies. A flow reactor with suitable high temperature ability and pressure control can directly and accurately mimic the conditions created in a microwave reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Damm | first1 = M. | last2 = Glasnov | first2 = T. N. | last3 = Kappe | first3 = C. O. | title = Translating High-Temperature Microwave Chemistry to Scalable Continuous Flow Processes | doi = 10.1021/op900297e | journal = Organic Process Research &amp; Development | volume = 14 | pages = 215 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This eases the synthesis of larger quantities by extending reaction time.

=== Manufacturing scale solutions ===
Flow systems can be scaled to the tons per hour scale. [[Plant redesign]] (batch to conti for an existing plant), Unit Operation (exchaning only one reaction step) and [[Modular Multi-purpose]] (Cutting a continuous plant into modular units) are typical realization solutions for flow processes.

=== Other uses of flow ===
It is possible to run experiments in flow using more sophisticated techniques, such as [[solid phase chemistry|solid phase chemistries]]. Solid phase [[reagent]]s, catalysts or scavengers can be used in [[solution]] and pumped through glass columns, for example, the synthesis of alkaloid natural product oxomaritidine using solid phase chemistries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baxendale|first=Ian R. |author2=Jon Deeley |author3=Charlotte M. Griffiths-Jones |author4=Steven V. Ley |author5=Steen Saaby |author6=Geoffrey K. Tranmer|title=A flow process for the multi-step synthesis of the alkaloid natural product oxomaritidine: a new paradigm for molecular assembly|journal=Chemical Communications|year=2006|issue=24|pages=2566–2568|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2006/CC/b600382f|accessdate=9 May 2013|doi= 10.1039/B600382F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an increasing interest in polymerization as a continuous flow process.  For example, '''[[Reversible addition−fragmentation chain transfer polymerization|Reversible Addition-Fragmentation chain Transfer]]''' or '''RAFT''' polymerization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hornung|first=Christian H. |author2=Guerrero-Sanchez, Carlos |author3=Brasholz, Malte |author4=Saubern, Simon |author5=Chiefari, John |author6=Moad, Graeme |author7=Rizzardo, Ezio |author8=Thang, San H. |title=Controlled RAFT Polymerization in a Continuous Flow Microreactor|journal=Org.

Continuous flow techniques have also been used for controlled generation of nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles in a Flow Microreactor|url=http://syrris.com/news/syrris-in-publications/368-synthesis-of-gold-nanoparticles-in-a-flow-microreactor|work=Rudy Metale|author=Marek Wojnicki|author2=Krzysztof Pacławski |author3=Magdalena Luty-Błocho |author4=Krzysztof Fitzner |author5=Paul Oakley |author6=Alan Stretton |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very rapid mixing and excellent temperature control of [[microreactors]] are able to give consistent and narrow particle size distribution of nanoparticles.

== Segmented flow chemistry ==
As discussed above, running experiments in continuous flow systems is difficult, especially when one is developing new chemical reactions, which requires screening of multiple components, varying stoichiometry, temperature and residence time. In continuous flow, experiments are performed serially, which means one experimental condition can be tested. Experimental throughput is highly variable and as typically five times the residence time is needed for obtaining [[Steady state (chemistry)|steady state]]. For temperature variation the thermal mass of the reactor as well as peripherals such as fluid baths need to be considered. More often than not, the analysis time needs to be considered.

Segmented flow is an approach that improves upon the speed in which screening, optimization and libraries can be conducted in flow chemistry. Segmented flow uses a "[[Plug flow reactor model|Plug Flow]]" approach where specific volumetric experimental mixtures are created and then injected into a high pressure flow reactor. Diffusion of the segment (reaction mixture) is minimized by using immiscible solvent on the leading and rear ends of the segment.

|[[File:Segment Graphics.gif|thumb|250px|alt=Segment flow through reactor|Segment serial flow]]
|}

One of the primary benefits of segmented flow chemistry is the ability to run experiments in a serial/parallel manner where experiments that share the same residence time and temperature can be repeatedly created and injected. In addition, the volume of each experiment is independent to that of the volume of the flow tube thereby saving a significant amount of reactant per experiment. When performing reaction screening and libraries, segment composition is typically varied by composition of matter. When performing reaction optimization, segments vary by stoichiometry.

|[[File:Serial-Parallel Segmented Flow Chemistry.jpg|230px|thumb|upright|alt=Serial/Parallel Segmented Flow|Serial/Parallel Segments]]
|}

Segmented flow is also used with online LCMS, both analytical and preparative where the segments are detected when exiting the reactor using UV and subsequently diluted for analytical LCMS or injected directly for preparative LCMS.

'''Gay sexual practices''' are [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] involving [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM), regardless of their [[sexual orientation]] or [[sexual identity]]. The authors of the 1948 [[Kinsey Reports]] state that 37% of their male subjects had had at least one homosexual experience.&lt;ref&gt;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, p. 656&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence shows that sex between men is significantly underreported in surveys due to [[social desirability bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Turner CF, Ku L, Rogers SM, Lindberg LD, Pleck JH, Sonenstein FL |title=Adolescent sexual behavior, drug use, and violence: increased reporting with computer survey technology |journal=Science  |volume=280 |issue=5365 |pages=867–73 |date=May 1998 |pmid=9572724 |doi=10.1126/science.280.5365.867}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nber.org"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Size of the LGBT Population and the Magnitude of Anti-Gay Sentiment are Substantially Underestimated |journal=Management Science |volume=63 |issue=10 |pages=3168–3186 |year=2013 |first1=Katherine B. |last1=Coffman |first2=Lucas C. |last2=Coffman |first3=Keith M.

Historically, [[anal sex]] has been popularly associated with male [[homosexuality]] and MSM.

Wellings et al. reported that "the equation of 'homosexual' with 'anal' sex among men is common among lay and health professionals alike," whereas an [[online survey]] of 18,000 MSM in Europe "showed that oral sex was most commonly practised, followed by mutual masturbation, with anal intercourse in third place."&lt;ref name="Wellings"/&gt; A 2011 survey by ''[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'' found similar results for U.S. gay and bisexual men.

Frot can be enjoyable because it mutually and simultaneously stimulates the genitals of both partners as it tends to produce pleasurable friction against the [[Frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenulum]] nerve bundle on the underside of each man's penile shaft, just below the [[External urethral orifice (male)|urinary opening]] (meatus) of the penis [[glans penis|head]] (glans penis). [[Intercrural sex]] is another form of non-penetrative sex that can be practiced between MSM. [[Docking (sex)|Docking]] (the insertion of one man's penis into another man's foreskin) is also practiced.

Various [[sex position]]s may be performed. In one study of U.K. and U.S. respondents, those respondents who identified as gay reported that [[doggy style]], [[Missionary position|missionary]], [[69 (sex position)|69]], oral, and anal (in that order) were their favorite sex positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.dred.com/uk/preferred-positions.html | title = Preferred Positions: A Look at Sexual Favourites Across Europe and the U.S. | website = DrEd.com | access-date = March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSM may also engage in [[BDSM]] or use [[sex toys]]. A nationally representative survey carried out in Australia from 2001 to 2002 found that, in the 12 months prior to the survey, 4.4% of gay men and 14.2% of bisexual men participated in BDSM-related sexual activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Richters J. |author2=De Visser R.

The '''Graduation Pledge of Social and Environmental Responsibility''' has been offered since 1987 at [[college]]s and [[University|universities]] throughout the [[United States]] and the world. The Pledge states: ''I pledge to explore and take into account the social and environmental consequences of any job I consider and will try to improve these aspects of any organizations for which I work.'' The purpose of the Pledge is to encourage graduating students to be mindful of the social and environmental impacts of their [[employment]] as they enter the workforce or continue their [[education]]. It is up to students to define for themselves what socially and environmentally responsible means. Over one hundred Universities and colleges as well as some high schools use the pledge to some extent. There are several different types of schools involved, including the following:

Students who voluntarily sign the pledge seek out employment that reflects their values, sometimes turning down jobs with which they do not feel comfortable. Others work to make changes after they are on the job. Some examples include promoting [[recycling]] at their workplace, removing discriminatory language from training materials, working for [[gender equality]] in athletics, and helping to convince employers to reject contracts that would clearly have negative impacts on society or the environment.

The Pledge was first established at [[Humboldt State University]], [[California]], in 1987. Manchester University in [[Indiana]] hosted the effort from 1996 to 2007, at which time [[Bentley University]] near [[Boston]] became the host. The project takes shape in different ways depending on the institution. At some colleges, for example, students sign wallet-sized cards with the Pledge written on them that they can keep as a reminder of the commitment they've made. Some institutions put the Pledge into the formal program for their Commencement ceremonies. At other institutions, pledge signers wear green ribbons or green tassels at Commencement to signify their commitment (some schools use a different color of ribbon). At Bentley University the pledge is a "capstone" of its four-year Civic Leadership Program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.bentley.edu/alliance/BCLP/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209232933/http://legacy.bentley.edu/alliance/BCLP/ |archivedate=2011-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at Humboldt State University, the student government funds a student Pledge coordinator internship.
The Pledge serves to promote social and environmental responsibility on three different levels: Students and alumni who are making choices about employment; schools including values and citizenship in their curriculum as opposed to just knowledge and skills; and the workplaces and wider society being concerned about issues beyond just the bottom line. The Graduation Pledge Alliance maintains a web site for campus organizers and those who have signed the Pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graduationpledge.org |title=Graduation Pledge Alliance &amp;#124; Social and Environmental Responsibility Works |website=Graduationpledge.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(In the [[automation]] and [[engineering]] environments, the '''hardware''' engineer or architect encompasses the [[electronic engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]] fields, with subspecialities in [[analog circuit|analog]], [[Digital data|digital]], or [[electromechanical]] systems.)

The '''hardware systems architect''' or '''hardware architect''' is responsible for:
*Interfacing with a [[systems architect]] or client [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]].  It is extraordinarily rare nowadays for sufficiently large and/or complex hardware systems that require a hardware architect not to require substantial software and a systems architect. The hardware architect will therefore normally interface with a systems architect, rather than directly with user(s), sponsor(s), or other client stakeholders. However, in the absence of a systems architect, the hardware systems architect must be prepared to interface directly with the client stakeholders in order to determine their (evolving) needs to be realized in hardware.  The hardware architect may also need to interface directly with a software architect or engineer(s), or with other mechanical or electrical engineers.
*Generating the highest level of hardware requirements, based on the user's needs and other constraints such as cost and schedule.
*Ensuring that this set of high level requirements is consistent, complete, correct, and [[operational definition|operationally defined]].
*Performing [[cost–benefit analysis|cost–benefit analyses]] to determine the best methods or approaches for meeting the hardware requirements; making maximum use of [[commercial off-the-shelf]] or already developed components.
*Developing partitioning [[algorithms]] (and other processes) to [[Memory allocation|allocate]] all present and foreseeable (hardware) requirements into discrete hardware partitions such that a minimum of [[communications protocol|communications]] is needed among partitions, and between the user and the system. 
*Partitioning large hardware systems into (successive layers of) [[subsystem]]s and components each of which can be handled by a single hardware engineer or team of engineers.
*Ensuring that maximally [[robust hardware architecture]] is developed.
*Generating a set of [[acceptance test]] requirements, together with the designers, [[test engineers]], and the user, which determine that all of the high level hardware requirements have been met, especially for the [[computer-human-interface]].
*Generating products such as sketches, [[computer model|models]], an early user's manual, and prototypes to keep the user and the engineers constantly up to date and in agreement on the system to be provided as it is evolving. 

==Background==
Large systems architecture was developed as a way to handle systems too large for one person to conceive of, let alone design.  Systems of this size are rapidly becoming the norm, so architectural approaches and architects are increasingly needed to solve the problems of large systems.

===Users and sponsors===
Engineers as a group do not have a reputation for understanding and responding to human needs comfortably or for developing humanly functional and aesthetically pleasing products.  Architects ''are'' expected to understand human needs and develop humanly functional and aesthetically pleasing products. A good architect is a translator between the user/sponsor and the engineers—and even among just engineers of different specialties.  A good architect is also the principal keeper of the user's vision of the end product—and of the process of deriving requirements from and implementing that vision.

Determining what the users/sponsors actually want, rather than what they say they want, ''is not engineering—it is an art.''  An architect does not follow an exact procedure.  S/he communicates with users/sponsors in a highly interactive way—together they extract the true ''requirements'' necessary for the engineered system.  The hardware architect must remain constantly in communication with the end users (or a systems architect).  Therefore, the architect must be familiar with the user's environment and problem.  The engineer need only be very knowledgeable of the potential engineering solution space.

===High-level requirements===
The user/sponsor should view the architect as the user's representative and provide ''all input through the architect.''  Direct interaction with project engineers is generally discouraged as the chance of mutual misunderstanding is very high.  The user requirements' specification should be a joint product of the user and hardware architect (or, the systems and hardware architects): the user brings his  needs and wish list, the architect brings knowledge of what is likely to prove doable within cost and time constraints.  When the user needs are translated into a set of high level requirements is also the best time to write the first version of the [[acceptance test]], which should, thereafter, be religiously kept up to date with the requirements.  That way, the user will be absolutely clear about what s/he is getting.  It is also a safeguard against untestable requirements, misunderstandings, and requirements creep.

The development of the first level of hardware engineering requirements is not a purely analytical exercise and should also involve both the hardware architect and engineer.  If any compromises are to be made—to meet constraints like cost, schedule, power, or space, the architect must ensure that the final product and overall look and feel do not stray very far from the user's intent.  The engineer should focus on developing a design that optimizes the constraints but ensures a workable and reliable product.  The architect is primarily concerned with the comfort and [[usability]] of the product; the engineer is primarily concerned with the producibility and [[Utility (patent)|utility]] of the product. 

The provision of needed services to the user is the true function of an engineered system.  However, as systems become ever larger and more complex, and as their  emphases move away from simple hardware components, the narrow application of traditional hardware development principles is found to be insufficient—the application of the more general principles of hardware architecture to the design of (sub) systems is seen to be needed.  A Hardware architecture is also a simplified model of the finished end product—its primary function is to define the hardware components and their relationships to each other so that the whole can be seen to be a consistent, complete, and correct representation of what the user had in mind—especially for the computer–human interface.  It is also used to ensure that the components fit together and relate in the desired way.

It is necessary to distinguish between the architecture of the user's world and the engineered hardware architecture.  The former represents and addresses problems and solutions in the ''user's'' world.  It is principally captured in the [[computer–human interface]]s (CHI) of the engineered system.  The engineered system represents the ''engineering'' solutions—how the ''engineer'' proposes to develop and/or select and combine the components of the technical infrastructure to support the CHI.  In the absence of an architect, there is an unfortunate tendency to confuse the two architectures, since the engineer thinks in terms of hardware, but the user may be thinking in terms of solving a problem of getting people from point A to point B in a reasonable amount of time and with a reasonable expenditure of energy, or of getting needed information to customers and staff. A hardware architect is expected to combine knowledge of both the architecture of the user's world and of (all potentially useful) hardware engineering architectures.  The former is a joint activity with the user; the latter is a joint activity with the engineers.  The product is a set of high level requirements reflecting the user's requirements which can be used by the engineers to develop hardware systems design requirements.

Because requirements evolve over the course of a project, especially a long one, an architect is needed until the hardware system is accepted by the user: the architect is the best insurance that no changes and interpretations made during the course of development compromise the user's viewpoint.

===Cost–benefit analyses===
Most hardware engineers are specialists.  They know the applications of hardware design and development intimately, apply their knowledge to practical situations—that is, solve real world problems, evaluate the cost–benefits of various solutions within their hardware specialty, and ensure the correct operation of whatever they design.  Hardware architects are generalists.  They are not expected to be experts in any one hardware technology or approach, but are expected to be knowledgeable of many, and able to judge their applicability to specific situations.  They also apply their knowledge to practical situations, but evaluate the cost/benefits of various solutions using different hardware technologies, for example, specially developed versus commercially available hardware components, and assure that the system as a whole performs according to the user's expectations.

Many commercial-off-the-shelf or already developed hardware components may be selected independently according to constraints such as cost, response, throughput, etc.  In some cases, the architect can already assemble the end system unaided.  Or, s/he may still need the help of a hardware engineer to select components and to design and build any special purpose function.  The architects (or engineers) may also enlist the aid of specialists—in safety, security, communications, special purpose hardware, graphics, human factors, test and evaluation, quality control, RMA, interface management, etc.  An effective hardware architectural team must have immediate access to specialists in critical specialties. 

===Partitioning and layering===
An architect planning a building works on the overall design, making sure it will be pleasing and useful to its inhabitants. While a  single architect by himself may be enough to build a single-family house,  many engineers may be needed, in addition, to solve the detailed problems that arise when a novel high-rise building is designed.  If the job is large and complex enough, parts of the architecture may be designed as components.  That is, if we are building a housing complex, we may have one architect for the complex, and one for each type of building, as part of an ''architectural team.'' 

Large hardware systems also require an architect and much engineering talent.  If the engineered system is large and complex enough, the chief hardware systems architect may defer to subordinate architects for parts of the job, although they all may be members of a joint architectural team.  ''But the architect must never be viewed as an engineering supervisor.''

The architect should sub-allocate the hardware requirements to major components or subsystems that are within the scope of a single hardware engineer, or engineering manager or subordinate architect.  Ideally, each such hardware component/subsystem is a sufficiently stand-alone object that it can be tested as a complete component, separate from the whole, using only a simple testbed to supply simulated inputs and record outputs.  That is, it is not necessary to know how an air traffic control system works in order to design and build a data management subsystem for it.  It is only necessary to know the constraints under which the subsystem will be expected to operate.

A good architect ensures that the system, however complex, is built upon relatively simple and "clean" concepts for each (sub) system or layer—easily understandable by everyone, especially the user, without special training. The architect will use a minimum of rules to ensure that each partition is well-defined and clean of [[kludge]]s, [[work-arounds]], short-cuts, or confusing detail and exceptions. As user needs evolve, (once the system is fielded and in use), it is a lot easier subsequently to evolve a simple concept than one laden with exceptions, special cases, and lots of "fine print."

''Layering'' the hardware architecture is important for keeping it sufficiently simple at each ''layer'' so that it remains comprehensible to a single mind. As layers are ascended, whole systems at ''lower layers'' become simple ''components'' at the ''higher layers,'' and may disappear altogether at the ''highest layers.''

===Acceptance test===
The acceptance test always remains the principal responsibility of the architect(s).  It is the chief means by which the architect will prove to the user that the hardware is as originally planned and that all subordinate architects and engineers have met their objectives.  Large projects tend to be dynamic, with changes along the way needed by the user (e.g., as his problems change), or expected of the user (e.g., for cost or schedule reasons). But acceptance tests must be kept current at all times. They are the principal means by which the user is kept informed as to how the final product will perform.  And they act as the principal goal towards which all subordinate personnel must design, build and test for.

===Good communications with users and engineers===
A building architect uses sketches, models, drawings.  A hardware systems architect should use sketches, models, and prototypes to discuss different solutions and results with the user or system architect, engineers, and subordinate architects.  An early, draft version of the user's manual is invaluable, especially in conjunction with a prototype.  A set of (engineering) ''requirements'' as a means of communicating with the users is explicitly to be avoided.  A well written ''set of requirements,'' or [[specification]], is intelligible only to the engineering fraternity, much as a legal contract is for lawyers.

'''CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology''' ('''CSIR-IGIB''') is a scientific [[research institute]] devoted primarily to biological research. It is a part of [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR), India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csir.res.in Council of Scientific and Industrial Research India Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927141436/http://csir.res.in/ |date=2015-09-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was founded in 1977 as the [[Center for Biochemical Technology]] with a primary focus on biochemical research, but has since shifted its research focus to integrative biology.

==Location==
The Institute has two campuses in Delhi. The North Campus is older of the two campuses and is in the campus of [[Delhi University]], on Mall Road opposite to [[Jubilee Hall, Delhi|Jubilee Hall]]. 
The new campus is in South Delhi, on Mathura Road at Sukhdev Vihar. 

== History ==

IGIB was established in 1977 as the [[Center for Biochemical Technology]] (CBT). The Functional Genomics Unit was established in 1998 with the focus shifting from chemical to genomics research. The institute was renamed "Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology" in 2002.

== Achievements ==
In 2009, a team at the institute sequenced the [[genome]] of the wild-type [[zebrafish]], with about 1.7 billion base pairs. This made the fish, which is native to the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] region, the first [[vertebrate]] to have its whole genome sequenced in India, as previously Indian scientists had only sequenced bacteria and plant genomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.igib.res.in Zebrafish Genome Webpage] 'Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology' (IGIB)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Decoding-the-Genome-Mystery/485122 Decoding the Genome Mystery] [[Indian Express]], 5 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, scientists at IGIB performed the first re-sequencing of a human genome in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/videoie.php?videoId=201 Indian Scientists decode human genome] ''[[Indian Express]]'', 10 December 2009 {{deadlink|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* {{Cite journal | author=Patowary| title=Systematic analysis and functional annotation of variations in the genome of an Indian individual. | journal=Human Mutation | volume=33| issue=7 | year=2012| pages=1133–40 | doi= 10.1002/humu.22091 | pmid=22461382 | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.22091/pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vinodscaria.rnabiology.org/indian-genome Compilation of news articles and Press releases on Indian Genome], 10 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute also collaborated on decoding the first Sri Lankan &lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.igib.res.in/SriLankan/ Sri Lankan genome ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Dissanayake| title=The Sri Lankan Personal Genome Project: an overview. | journal=Sri Lanka Journal of Biomedical Informatics | volume=1| issue=2 | year=2012| pages=4–8 | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://www.sljol.info/index.php/SLJBMI/article/download/3711/3073]&lt;/ref&gt; genome and Malayasian genome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://promiseuitm.org/component/content/article/34-slideshow/50-the-first-malay-genome.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is also a member of the Open Personal Genomics Consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://openpgx.org/ |title=OpenPGx Consortium |access-date=7 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171218064848/http://www.openpgx.org/ |archive-date=18 December 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genomics of Rare Genetic Diseases==
The institute has initiated a unique programme to use cutting edge genomic technologies to understand Rare [[genetic diseases]] in India and pioneering the application of genomics for [[Precision Medicine]] in clinics. One of the programmes which has been initiated on this front is Genomics for Understanding Rare Disease, India Alliance Network (GUaRDIAN).&lt;ref&gt;[http://guardian.meragenome.com Genomics for Understanding Rare Diseases India Alliance Network (GUaRDIAN)]&lt;/ref&gt; GUaRDIAN is a large-scale collaborative network of clinicians from around India trying to use genomics in clinical practice, with the focussed aim to understand genetic structure of rare genetic diseases in India.

The consortium aims at using cutting edge genomics technology to enable identification of genetic variations in diseases  and enable clinicians arrive at precise diagnosis for rare genetic disease. Apart from working closely with clinicians, the consortium aims to foster education, awareness and the widespread adoption of genomic technology in clinical settings, in addition to creating and disseminating the highest standards of genomic data generation and interpretation in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guardian.meragenome.com/exome-sequence-analysis-and-interpretation Exome Sequencing Analysis and Interpretation page on GUaRDIAN]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the few years, it has been able to work closely with clinicians in the network to be able to offer proof of principles for the application of Genomics for Precision Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Gupta  |title=Whole-exome sequencing solves diagnostic dilemma in a rare case of sporadic acrokeratosis verruciformis. | journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology. | volume=| issue= | year=2015| pages= | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.12983/abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Gupta  |title=Whole exome sequencing helps in accurate molecular diagnosis in siblings with a rare co-occurrence of paternally inherited 22q12 duplication and autosomal recessive non-syndromic ichthyosis. | journal=F1000 Research. | volume=| issue= | year=2015| pages= | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://f1000research.com/articles/4-446/v1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Vellarikkal  |title=Exome sequencing reveals a novel mutation, p.L325H, in the KRT5 gene associated with autosomal dominant Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex Koebner type in a large family from western India. | journal=Human Genome Variation. | volume=1| issue=1 | year=2014| pages=14007  | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://www.nature.com/articles/hgv20147]&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive programme for patient referral is also functional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guardian.meragenome.com/referral Patient Referral Page Genomics for Understanding Rare Diseases India Alliance Network (GUaRDIAN)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extension Centers (Branches)==
The main IGIB campus is located at Mall Road, New Delhi near Delhi University North Campus. IGIB's alliance with the Biotech/Pharmaceuticals has led to its growth and setting up of two extension centers - one at South Delhi (IGIB Annex at TCGA, Okhla) and the other at Western Delhi at Naraina.

==International Meetings==
IGIB was a co-host of the 13th meeting of the [[Human Genome Organization]] (HUGO) in 2008, held at [[Hyderabad International Convention Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hgm2008.hugo-international.org HGM-2008 website].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Promotional Marketing''' is a [[marketing]] organization in the [[United Kingdom]].

Originally set up in 1933 as the British Sales Promotion Association, it was known by various names until it was awarded Institute status in 1979 as the Institute of Sales Promotion. In the UK, "[[Institute]]" is a legally protected term which is only granted to organisations that can demonstrate achievement in areas such as education, development and research.

The organisation continued to be known as the ISP until June 2010, when it changed to the Institute of Promotional Marketing.

The IPM provides professional diplomas and certificates, best-practice guidelines and legal and copy clearance advice for the promotional marketing industry in the UK. It also represents the interests of promotional marketing practitioners with regulators, government officials and politicians, both in the UK and in the European Union.

The decision to change the organisation's name from the Institute of Sales Promotion to the Institute of Promotional Marketing was the result of many years' debate. It was eventually decided that the term "sales promotion" was restrictive, because, strictly speaking, it refers to a relatively small number of techniques traditionally used only with the retail environment. While Institute members may still run some promotions that use these sales promotions techniques, the majority of the work they do involves other promotional marketing techniques.

The '''Inter-Services Public Relations''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|بین الخدماتی تعلقات عامہ}}}}; [[Reporting mark|Reporting name:]]'''ISPR'''), is the media wing of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] which broadcasts and coordinates military news and information to the country's [[Media of Pakistan|civilian media]] and the [[Pakistani society|civic society]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adache, PhD|first1=Col. John|title=The Military and Public Relations|date=2014|publisher=AuthorHouse Publications|location=Bloomington, Indiana [US]|isbn=1496982363|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BMQBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT58&amp;dq=inter+services+public+relations+pakistan+army&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F-5qVIKVM5GZjALxv4CoBA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=inter%20services%20public%20relations%20pakistan%20army&amp;f=true|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISPR directorate serves the purpose of aiming to strengthen [[Public Relations Officer|public relations]] with the [[Pakistani society|civic society]], through interacting with the media.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt; The directorate also works as the principle voice of the Pakistan's [[Pakistan Armed Forces|military]], with its [[director-general]] serving as the official spokesperson of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|armed forces]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt; In addition, the ISPR provides funds, productions, and assists with the military-produced public relations media– both military [[Pakistani dramas|dramas]] and the [[Pakistan film industry|war films]].&lt;ref name="Express Tribune, 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=WebDesk|title=Short film 'Defender' wins award at international defence film festival|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/791718/short-film-defender-wins-award-at-rome-film-festival/|accessdate=30 November 2017|publisher=The Express Tribune (newspaper)|date=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The Directorate of the Inter–Services Public Relations (ISPR) was established in 1949 with [[Pakistan Army|army]] [[colonel]] Shahbaz Khan becoming its first director-general.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt; The ISPR operates as a unified public relations system for the Pakistan's [[Pakistan Armed Forces|military]], which combined [[Pakistan Army|army]], [[Pakistan Air Force|air force]], [[Pakistan Navy|navy]], and [[Pakistan Marines|marines]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt; The ISPR manage the public relations requirement of the armed forces, and is staff with the combined personnel of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|military]] along with civilian officers.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt; It functions at the [[Joint Staff Headquarters (Pakistan)|Joint Staff Headquarters]] (JS HQ) and plays an important role for gathering a national support for the [[Pakistani military|armed forces]] at the public level.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt; The ISPR also strengthened support for the [[Pakistani military|military]]'s assigned contingency operations while undermining the will of the adversary.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt;

In views of [[United States Army|US army]] colonel John Adache, the ISPR interfaces between the [[Pakistan armed forces|armed forces]], [[Media of Pakistan|civil media]], and the [[Pakistani society|civic society]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt;  Furthermore, the ISPR also formulates the media policy of the unified [[Pakistan armed forces|armed forces]], safeguards the military interests of the [[Pakistan armed forces|armed forces]] from negative influence, and monitors international and domestic media reporting regarding its military issues.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt;

On regular basis, the ISPR broadcasts the televised news regarding the strategic arsenals testings, contingency operations and [[military exercise]]s— both at foreign and domestic areas. In [[Military of Pakistan|Pakistan's military]] staff appointments and assignments, the ISPR is one of the most prestigious directorate of [[Pakistan Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt;

Its executive authority, a [[director-general]], is a chief military spokesperson of the Pakistan Armed Forces who reports to [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (Pakistan)|Chairman]] of [[Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, Pakistan|Joint Chiefs of Staff Secretariat]]; [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]] as well the head also directly report to [[Chief of Air Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Air Staff]], [[Commandant]] of [[Pakistan Marines|Marines]], and the [[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Naval Staff]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt;

==Operations==
The ISPR directorate is staffed with combined personnel of Pakistan's unified [[Pakistan Defence Forces|military]] along with civilian [[Central Superior Services of Pakistan|bureaucrats]] and officials.&lt;ref name="Govt. of Pakistan (PowerPoint)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=staff |title=The ISPR |url=https://lib.vcomsats.edu.pk/library/MPA517/MPA517%20PPT/Lecture_30/Lecture-30.pptx |publisher=Govt. of Pakistan (PowerPoint) |accessdate=18 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISPR functioned at the [[JS HQ (Pakistan)|JS HQ]] and responsible for garnering national support for the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|armed forces]] as well as strengthen their resolve to accomplish the assigned mission while undermining the will of the adversary.

It also acts as an interface between the armed forces, the media and the public.&lt;ref name="Govt. of Pakistan (PowerPoint)"/&gt; It formulates much of the media policy of Pakistan's military, safeguards the armed forces from negative influences and monitors both international and domestic media.

It is likely that the army is planning the further expansion of ISPR to counter negative propaganda against the state and armed forces by international powers and their funded domestic media campaigns, in ongoing operation against terror outfits and economic terrorism.
That's why, for the first time in its history ISPR was being led by a three-star general,
Lt-General Asim Saleem Bajwa.&lt;ref name="Govt. of Pakistan -(PowerPoint)-"&gt; {{cite web|last1=staff |title=Bajwa, three others promoted to Lt Gen rank |url=https://www.samaa.tv/news/2015/09/bajwa-three-others-promoted-to-lt-gen/ |publisher=Samaa News |accessdate=22 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principal media network==

On regular basis, the ISPR release televised press releases on regarding the ongoing [[military exercises]], and notified the [[Media of Pakistan|civilian media]] about the ingenious strategic arsenal testings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISPR Press Release on testings|url=https://www.ispr.gov.pk/front/main.asp?o=t-press_release&amp;id=2707#pr_link2707|publisher=ISPR Press Release|date=17 November 2014|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISPR Press Release, timeline"&gt;{{cite web|last1=DG ISPR|title=ISPR Press release|url=https://www.ispr.gov.pk/front/main.asp?o=t-pr_archive&amp;mon=10&amp;yr=2014&amp;styr=2013|publisher=ISPR Press Release, timeline|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from functioning as the public relations body of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|armed forces]], the ISPR handles exclusive dissemination of information regarding Pakistan's ongoing military [[War in North-West Pakistan|contingency operations]].&lt;ref name="Govt. of Pakistan (PowerPoint)" /&gt;

== Controversies ==
In recent years, there have been accusations of ISPR going beyond its domain and meddling in media affairs to undermine democracy. Concerns have been raised on ISPR handling media channels (Bol TV, Pak TV et al.), radio stations (FM 89.04, FM 96.00 ) and several media personalities such as Dr Shahid Masood, Arshad Sharif, Sami Ibrahim, Dr Aamir Liaqat etc. to indoctrinate pro-military narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/pakistan/how-many-radio-stations-journalists-work-for-you-asma-jahangir-asks-ispr/|title=How many radio stations, journalists work for you? Asma Jahangir asks ISPR|work=Daily Pakistan Global|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISPR has regularly been criticized for posting inflammatory tweets on their official Twitter account. In April 2017, Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor (a BPS-21 officer) posted a tweet 'rejecting' Prime Minister's directives to probe Dawn Leaks controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1396876/pakistan-army-rejects-govt-notification-dawn-leaks/|title=Army rejects PM Office statement on Dawn Leaks report - The Express Tribune|date=2017-04-29|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After huge public outcry over the choice of words, ISPR had to redact its earlier tweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1332244|title=Army withdraws tweet 'rejecting' PM Office's directives on Dawn story probe|last=Dawn.com|date=2017-05-10|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, during Allama Khadim Rizvi's Islamabad sit-in a tweet was posted attributing COAS's appeal to 'both sides' to exercise restraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.samaa.tv/pakistan/2017/11/coas-telephones-pm-suggests-handle-islamabad-dharna-situation-peacefully/|title=COAS suggests PM to handle Islamabad dharna situation peacefully|website=www.samaa.tv|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was widely decried for equating people's elected government against a mob, further strengthening the belief that Army was behind the sit-ins to arm-twist government.

==Media production==

Since the 1990s, the ISPR has been [[Director (film)|directing]], [[Film producer|producing]], assisting in [[Film writer|writings]], and funding the miniseries, drama, and films on military fiction. Some of its highly acclaimed works include: [[Alpha Bravo Charlie]]— a television series on [[Pakistan Army]] directed by [[Shoaib Mansoor]] in 1990

*[[Shahpar]]— a television drama on [[Pakistan Air Force]] funded by ISPR and broadcast at [[ARY Digital]]
*[[PNS Ghazi (Shaheed)]]— a [[thriller drama]] based on [[Pakistan Navy]] broadcast at [[Pakistan Television Corporation|PTV]]
* [[Waar]]
*[[The Glorious Resolve]]
* ''Sunehre Din''
* ''Wilco''
* ''Revenge''
* "Zinda"
* [[Ek Thi Marium]]

{{refimprove|date=September 2018}}
An '''intrusion detection system''' ('''IDS''') is a device or [[software application]] that monitors a [[Computer network|network]] or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a [[security information and event management]] (SIEM) system. A SIEM system combines outputs from multiple sources, and uses [[alarm filtering]] techniques to distinguish malicious activity from false alarms.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

IDS types range in scope from single computers to large networks.&lt;ref&gt; Axelsson, S (2000). [http://neuro.bstu.by/ai/To-dom/My_research/Paper-0-again/For-research/D-mining/Anomaly-D/Intrusion-detection/taxonomy.pdf "Intrusion Detection Systems: A Survey and Taxonomy"] (retrieved 21 May 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; The most common classifications are '''network intrusion detection systems''' ('''NIDS''') and '''[[host-based intrusion detection system]]s''' ('''HIDS'''). A system that monitors important operating system files is an example of an HIDS, while a system that analyzes incoming network traffic is an example of an NIDS. It is also possible to classify IDS by detection approach: the most well-known variants are signature-based detection (recognizing bad patterns, such as [[malware]]); and [[Anomaly-based intrusion detection system|anomaly-based detection]] (detecting deviations from a model of "good" traffic, which often relies on [[machine learning]]). Some IDS products have the ability to respond to detected intrusions. Systems with response capabilities are typically referred to as an '''intrusion prevention system'''.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

== Comparison with firewalls ==
Although they both relate to network security, an IDS differs from a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] in that a firewall looks outwardly for intrusions in order to stop them from happening. Firewalls limit access between networks to prevent intrusion and do not signal an attack from inside the network. An IDS describes a suspected intrusion once it has taken place and signals an alarm. An IDS also watches for attacks that originate from within a system.  This is traditionally achieved by examining network communications, identifying [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] and patterns (often known as signatures) of common computer attacks, and taking action to alert operators.  A system that terminates connections is called an intrusion prevention system, and is another form of an [[application layer firewall]].{{fact|date=September 2018}}

== Intrusion detection ==
IDS can be classified by where detection takes place (network or [[Host (network)|host]]) and the detection method that is employed.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

For IDS related to [[Wireless sensor network|Wireless Sensor Networks]] (WSNs), readers may refer to Butun et al.'s &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butun|first=Ismail|last2=Morgera|first2=Salvatore D.|last3=Sankar|first3=Ravi|date=2014|title=A Survey of Intrusion Detection Systems in Wireless Sensor Networks|url=https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2013.050113.00191|journal=IEEE Communications Surveys &amp; Tutorials|language=en-US|volume=16|issue=1|pages=266–282|doi=10.1109/surv.2013.050113.00191|issn=1553-877X}}&lt;/ref&gt; work.

=== Analyzed activity ===

====Network intrusion detection systems====
Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are placed at a strategic point or points within the network to monitor traffic to and from all devices on the network. It performs an analysis of passing traffic on the entire [[Subnetwork|subnet]], and matches the traffic that is passed on the subnets to the library of known attacks. Once an attack is identified, or abnormal behavior is sensed, the alert can be sent to the administrator. An example of an NIDS would be installing it on the subnet where firewalls are located in order to see if someone is trying to break into the firewall. Ideally one would scan all inbound and outbound traffic, however doing so might create a bottleneck that would impair the overall speed of the network. [[OPNET]] and NetSim are commonly used tools for simulating network intrusion detection systems. NID Systems are also capable of comparing signatures for similar packets to link and drop harmful detected packets which have a signature matching the records in the NIDS.
When we classify the design of the NIDS according to the system interactivity property, there are two types: on-line and off-line NIDS, often referred to as inline and tap mode, respectively. On-line NIDS deals with the network in real time. It analyses the [[Ethernet frame|Ethernet packets]] and applies some rules, to decide if it is an attack or not. Off-line NIDS deals with stored data and passes it through some processes to decide if it is an attack or not.

NIDS can also combined with other technologies to increase detection, and prediction, rates. [[Artificial neural network|Artificial Neural Network]] based IDS are capable of analyzing huge volumes of data, in a smart way, due to the self-organizing structure that allows INS IDS to more efficiently recognize intrusion patterns&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garzia|first=Fabio|last2=Lombardi|first2=Mara|last3=Ramalingam|first3=Soodamani|date=2017|title=An integrated internet of everything — Genetic algorithms controller — Artificial neural networks framework for security/safety systems management and support|url=https://doi.org/10.1109/CCST.2017.8167863|journal=2017 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST)|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1109/ccst.2017.8167863|isbn=9781538615850|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Neural networks assist IDS in predicting attacks by learning from mistakes; INN IDS help develop an early warning system, based on two layers.

====Host intrusion detection systems====
{{Main article|Host-based intrusion detection system}}
Host intrusion detection systems (HIDS) run on individual hosts or devices on the network. A HIDS monitors the inbound and outbound packets from the device only and will alert the user or administrator if suspicious activity is detected. It takes a snapshot of existing system files and matches it to the previous snapshot. If the critical system files were modified or deleted, an alert is sent to the administrator to investigate. An example of HIDS usage can be seen on mission critical machines, which are not expected to change their configurations.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

Intrusion detection systems can also be system-specific using custom tools and [[honeypot (computing)|honeypots]].{{fact|date=September 2018}}

=== Detection method ===

====Signature-based====
Signature-based IDS refers to the detection of attacks by looking for specific patterns, such as byte sequences in network traffic, or known malicious instruction sequences used by malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iup.edu/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=81109 |website=www.iup.edu |format=[[Microsoft PowerPoint|PPT]] |author=Brandon Lokesak |date=December 4, 2008 |title=A Comparison Between Signature Based and Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; This terminology originates from [[anti-virus software]], which refers to these detected patterns as signatures. Although signature-based IDS can easily detect known attacks, it is difficult to detect new attacks, for which no pattern is available.{{fact|date=September 2018}}
{{expand section|date=July 2016}}

In Signature-based IDS, the signatures are released by a vendor for its all products. On-time updation of the IDS with the signature is a key aspect

====Anomaly-based====
[[Anomaly-based intrusion detection system]]s were primarily introduced to detect unknown attacks, in part due to the rapid development of malware. The basic approach is to use machine learning to create a model of trustworthy activity, and then compare new behavior against this model. Although this approach enables the detection of previously unknown attacks, it may suffer from [[false positives]]: previously unknown legitimate activity may also be classified as malicious. Most of the existing IDSs suffer from the time-consuming during detection process that degrades the performance of IDSs. Efficient feature selection algorithm makes the classification process used in detection more reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowayda|first=A.

== Intrusion prevention ==

Some systems may attempt to stop an intrusion attempt but this is neither required nor expected of a monitoring system. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) are primarily focused on identifying possible incidents, logging information about them, and reporting attempts.  In addition, organizations use IDPS for other purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting existing threats and deterring individuals from violating security policies. IDPS have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization.&lt;ref name="nist80094"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-94/SP800-94.pdf |title=Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) |first1=Karen |last1=Scarfone |first2=Peter |last2=Mell |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |work=Computer Security Resource Center |issue=800–94 |accessdate=1 January 2010 |date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IDPS typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important observed events and produce reports. Many IDPS can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which involve the IDPS stopping the attack itself, changing the security environment (e.g. reconfiguring a firewall) or changing the attack's content.&lt;ref name="nist80094" /&gt;

'''Intrusion prevention systems''' ('''IPS'''), also known as '''intrusion detection and prevention systems''' ('''IDPS'''), are [[network security]] appliances that monitor network or system activities for malicious activity. The main functions of intrusion prevention systems are to identify malicious activity, log information about this activity, report it and attempt to block or stop it.{{r|GIDPS}}.

Intrusion prevention systems are considered extensions of intrusion detection systems because they both monitor network traffic and/or system activities for malicious activity. The main differences are, unlike intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems are placed in-line and are able to actively prevent or block intrusions that are detected.{{r|Newman2009|page1=273|WhitmanMattord2009|page2=289}} IPS can take such actions as sending an alarm, dropping detected malicious packets, resetting a connection or blocking traffic from the offending IP address.{{r|Boyles2010}} An IPS also can correct {{nobr|[[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC)}} errors, defragment packet streams, mitigate TCP sequencing issues, and clean up unwanted [[Transport layer|transport]] and [[network layer]] options.{{r|Newman2009|page1=278|TiptonKrause2007}}.

=== Classification ===
Intrusion prevention systems can be classified into four different types:{{r|GIDPS|Vacca2010}}

# '''Network-based intrusion prevention system (NIPS)''':  monitors the entire network for suspicious traffic by analyzing protocol activity.
# '''Wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS)''': monitor a wireless network for suspicious traffic by analyzing wireless networking protocols.
# '''Network behavior analysis (NBA)''': examines network traffic to identify threats that generate unusual traffic flows, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, certain forms of malware and policy violations.
# '''Host-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS)''': an installed software package which monitors a single host for suspicious activity by analyzing events occurring within that host.

=== Detection methods ===
The majority of intrusion prevention systems utilize one of three detection methods: signature-based, statistical anomaly-based, and stateful protocol analysis.{{r|WhitmanMattord2009|page1=301|KirdaJha2009}}

# '''Signature-based detection''': Signature-based IDS monitors packets in the Network and compares with pre-configured and pre-determined attack patterns known as signatures.
# '''Statistical anomaly-based detection''': An IDS which is anomaly-based will monitor network traffic and compare it against an established baseline. The baseline will identify what is "normal" for that network – what sort of bandwidth is generally used and what protocols are used. It may however, raise a False Positive alarm for legitimate use of bandwidth if the baselines are not intelligently configured.&lt;ref name="Whitman"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Stateful protocol analysis detection''': This method identifies deviations of protocol states by comparing observed events with "pre-determined profiles of generally accepted definitions of benign activity".{{r|WhitmanMattord2009}}

== Limitations ==
* [[noise (signal processing)|Noise]] can severely limit an intrusion detection system's effectiveness.  Bad packets generated from  software bugs, corrupt [[DNS]] data, and local packets that escaped can create a significantly high false-alarm rate.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite book

 |year = 2001
 |pages = 387–388
 |isbn = 978-0-471-38922-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is not uncommon for the number of real attacks to be far below the number of false-alarms. Number of real attacks is often so far below the number of false-alarms that the real attacks are often missed and ignored.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;{{Update inline|date=August 2017}}
* Many attacks are geared for specific versions of software that are usually outdated.  A constantly changing library of signatures is needed to mitigate threats. Outdated signature databases can leave the IDS vulnerable to newer strategies.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;
* For signature-based IDS, there will be lag between a new threat discovery and its signature being applied to the IDS. During this lag time, the IDS will be unable to identify the threat.&lt;ref name="Whitman" /&gt;
* It cannot compensate for weak identification and [[authentication]] mechanisms or for weaknesses in [[network protocol]]s. When an attacker gains access due to weak authentication mechanisms then IDS cannot prevent the adversary from any malpractice.
* Encrypted packets are not processed by most intrusion detection devices. Therefore, the encrypted packet can allow an intrusion to the network that is undiscovered until more significant network intrusions have occurred.
* Intrusion detection software provides information based on the [[network address]] that is associated with the IP packet that is sent into the network. This is beneficial if the network address contained in the IP packet is accurate. However, the address that is contained in the IP packet could be faked or scrambled.
* Due to the nature of NIDS systems, and the need for them to analyse protocols as they are captured, NIDS systems can be susceptible to the same protocol-based attacks to which network hosts may be vulnerable. Invalid data and [[TCP/IP stack]] attacks may cause an NIDS to crash.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giac.org/paper/gsec/235/limitations-network-intrusion-detection/100739&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evasion techniques ==
{{main article|Intrusion detection system evasion techniques}}
There are a number of techniques which attackers are using, the following are considered 'simple' measures which can be taken to evade IDS:
* Fragmentation: by sending fragmented packets, the attacker will be under the radar and can easily bypass the  detection system's ability to detect the attack signature.
* Avoiding defaults: The TCP port utilised by a protocol does not always provide an indication to the protocol which is being transported. For example, an IDS may expect to detect a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan]] on port 12345. If an attacker had reconfigured it to use a different port, the IDS may not be able to detect the presence of the trojan.
* Coordinated, low-bandwidth attacks: coordinating a scan among numerous attackers (or agents) and allocating different ports or hosts to different attackers makes it difficult for the IDS to correlate the captured packets and deduce that a network scan is in progress.
* Address [[Spoofing attack|spoofing]]/proxying: attackers can increase the difficulty of the Security Administrators ability to determine the source of the attack by using poorly secured or incorrectly configured proxy servers to bounce an attack. If the source is spoofed and bounced by a server, it makes it very difficult for IDS to detect the origin of the attack.
* Pattern change evasion: IDS generally rely on 'pattern matching' to detect an attack. By changing the data used in the attack slightly, it may be possible to evade detection. For example, an {{nobr|[[Internet Message Access Protocol]]}} (IMAP) server may be vulnerable to a buffer overflow, and an IDS is able to detect the attack signature of 10 common attack tools. By modifying the payload sent by the tool, so that it does not resemble the data that the IDS expects, it may be possible to evade detection.

== Development ==
The earliest preliminary IDS concept was delineated in 1980 by James Anderson at the [[National Security Agency]] and consisted of a set of tools intended to help administrators review audit trails.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James P., "Computer Security Threat Monitoring and Surveillance," Washing, PA, James P. Anderson Co., 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  User access logs, file access logs, and system event logs are examples of audit trails.

[[Fred Cohen]] noted in 1987 that it is impossible to detect an intrusion in every case, and that the resources needed to detect intrusions grow with the amount of usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=David M. Chess |author2=Steve R. White |work=Proceedings of Virus Bulletin Conference |title=An Undetectable Computer Virus |date=2000 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.25.1508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dorothy E. Denning]], assisted by [[Peter G. Neumann]], published a model of an IDS in 1986 that formed the basis for many systems today.&lt;ref&gt;Denning, Dorothy E., "An Intrusion Detection Model," Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, May 1986, pages 119–131&lt;/ref&gt;  Her model used statistics for [[anomaly detection]], and resulted in an early IDS at [[SRI International]] named the Intrusion Detection Expert System (IDES), which ran on [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] workstations and could consider both user and network level data.&lt;ref&gt;Lunt, Teresa F., "IDES:  An Intelligent System for Detecting Intruders," Proceedings of the Symposium on Computer Security; Threats, and Countermeasures; Rome, Italy, November 22–23, 1990, pages 110–121.&lt;/ref&gt;  IDES had a dual approach with a rule-based [[Expert System]] to detect known types of intrusions plus a statistical anomaly detection component based on profiles of users, host systems, and target systems. The author of "IDES: An Intelligent System for Detecting Intruders," Teresa F. Lunt, proposed adding an [[Artificial neural network]] as a third component.  She said all three components could then report to a resolver.  SRI followed IDES  in 1993 with the Next-generation Intrusion Detection Expert System (NIDES).&lt;ref&gt;Lunt, Teresa F., "Detecting Intruders in Computer Systems," 1993 Conference on Auditing and Computer Technology, SRI International&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Multics]] intrusion detection and alerting system (MIDAS), an expert system using P-BEST and [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], was developed in 1988 based on the work of Denning and Neumann.&lt;ref&gt;Sebring, Michael M., and Whitehurst, R. Alan., "Expert Systems in Intrusion Detection:  A Case Study," The 11th National Computer Security Conference, October, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;  Haystack was also developed in that year using statistics to reduce audit trails.&lt;ref&gt;Smaha, Stephen E., "Haystack:  An Intrusion Detection System," The Fourth Aerospace Computer Security Applications Conference, Orlando, FL, December, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 the [[National Security Agency]] started an IDS research transfer program under [[Rebecca Bace]]. Bace later published the seminal text on the subject, ''Intrusion Detection'', in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGraw|first1=Gary|title=Silver Bullet Talks with Becky Bace|journal=IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Magazine|date=May 2007|volume=5|issue=3|pages=6–9|doi=10.1109/MSP.2007.70|url=https://www.cigital.com/silver-bullet-files/shows/silverbullet-012-bbace.pdf|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wisdom &amp; Sense (W&amp;S) was a statistics-based anomaly detector developed in 1989 at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaccaro, H.S., and Liepins, G.E., "Detection of Anomalous Computer Session Activity," The 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, May, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  W&amp;S created rules based on statistical analysis, and then used those rules for anomaly detection.

In 1990, the Time-based Inductive Machine (TIM) did anomaly detection using inductive learning of sequential user patterns in [[Common Lisp]] on a [[VAX]] 3500 computer.&lt;ref&gt;Teng, Henry S., Chen, Kaihu, and Lu, Stephen C-Y, "Adaptive Real-time Anomaly Detection Using Inductively Generated Sequential Patterns," 1990 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy&lt;/ref&gt;  The Network Security Monitor (NSM) performed masking on access matrices for anomaly detection on a Sun-3/50 workstation.&lt;ref&gt;Heberlein, L. Todd, Dias, Gihan V., Levitt, Karl N., Mukherjee, Biswanath, Wood, Jeff, and Wolber, David, "A Network Security Monitor," 1990 Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy, Oakland, CA, pages 296–304&lt;/ref&gt;  The Information Security Officer's Assistant (ISOA) was a 1990 prototype that considered a variety of strategies including statistics, a profile checker, and an expert system.&lt;ref&gt;Winkeler, J.R., "A UNIX Prototype for Intrusion and Anomaly Detection in Secure Networks," The Thirteenth National Computer Security Conference, Washington, DC., pages 115–124, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  ComputerWatch at [[AT&amp;T Bell Labs]] used statistics and rules for audit data reduction and intrusion detection.&lt;ref&gt;Dowell, Cheri, and Ramstedt, Paul, "The ComputerWatch Data Reduction Tool," Proceedings of the 13th National Computer Security Conference, Washington, D.C., 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, in 1991, researchers at the [[University of California, Davis]] created a prototype Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS), which was also an expert system.&lt;ref&gt;Snapp, Steven R, Brentano, James, Dias, Gihan V., Goan, Terrance L., Heberlein, L. Todd, Ho, Che-Lin, Levitt, Karl N., Mukherjee, Biswanath, Smaha, Stephen E., Grance, Tim, Teal, Daniel M. and Mansur, Doug, "DIDS (Distributed Intrusion Detection System) -- Motivation, Architecture, and An Early Prototype," The 14th National Computer Security Conference, October, 1991, pages 167–176.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Network Anomaly Detection and Intrusion Reporter (NADIR), also in 1991, was a prototype IDS developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory's Integrated Computing Network (ICN), and was heavily influenced by the work of Denning and Lunt.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Kathleen, DuBois, David H., and Stallings, Cathy A., "A Phased Approach to Network Intrusion Detection," 14th National Computing Security Conference, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  NADIR used a statistics-based anomaly detector and an expert system.

The [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] announced [[Bro (software)|Bro]] in 1998, which used its own rule language for packet analysis from [[libpcap]] data.&lt;ref&gt;Paxson, Vern, "Bro:  A System for Detecting Network Intruders in Real-Time," Proceedings of the 7th USENIX Security Symposium, San Antonio, TX, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Network Flight Recorder (NFR) in 1999 also used libpcap.&lt;ref&gt;Amoroso, Edward, "Intrusion Detection:  An Introduction to Internet Surveillance, Correlation, Trace Back, Traps, and Response," Intrusion.Net Books, Sparta, New Jersey, 1999, {{ISBN|0-9666700-7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APE was developed as a packet sniffer, also using libpcap, in November, 1998, and was renamed [[Snort (software)|Snort]] one month later. Snort has since become the world's largest used IDS/IPS system with over 300,000 active users.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlenberg, Toby (Ed.), Alder, Raven, Carter, Dr. Everett F. (Skip), Jr., Esler, Joel., Foster, James C., Jonkman Marty, Raffael, and Poor, Mike, "Snort IDS and IPS Toolkit," Syngress, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-59749-099-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can monitor both local systems, and remote capture points using the [[TZSP]] protocol.

The Audit Data Analysis and Mining (ADAM) IDS in 2001 used [[tcpdump]] to build profiles of rules for classifications.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara, Daniel, Couto, Julia, Jajodia, Sushil, Popyack, Leonard, and Wu, Ningning, "ADAM:  Detecting Intrusions by Data Mining," Proceedings of the IEEE Workshop on Information Assurance and Security, West Point, NY, June 5–6, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Yongguang Zhang]] and Wenke Lee argue for the importance of IDS in networks with mobile nodes.&lt;ref&gt;Intrusion Detection Techniques for Mobile Wireless Networks, ACM WINET 2003 &lt;http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~wenke/papers/winet03.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Viegas and his colleagues &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Viegas|first=E.|last2=Santin|first2=A. O.|last3=Fran?a|first3=A.|last4=Jasinski|first4=R.|last5=Pedroni|first5=V.

'''Metamorphosis''' is a [[biological process]] by which an animal physically [[developmental biology|develops]] after [[birth]] or hatching, involving a conspicuous and relatively abrupt change in the animal's body structure through cell [[cell growth#Cell reproduction|growth]] and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]]. Metamorphosis is [[Iodothyronine deiodinase|iodothyronine]]-induced and an ancestral feature of all [[chordate]]s.&lt;ref name="cell.com"&gt;Robert J. Denser [http://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(08)00661-1.pdf Chordate Metamorphosis: Ancient Control by Iodothyronines] Current Biology, 2008, Vol 18 No 13, R567-9. DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2008.05.024&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[insect]]s, [[fish]]es, [[amphibian]]s, [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[cnidaria]]ns, [[echinoderm]]s, and [[tunicate]]s undergo metamorphosis, which is often accompanied by a change of [[nutrition]] source or [[behavior]]. Animals that go through metamorphosis are called metamorphoses.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Animals can be divided into species that undergo complete metamorphosis ("[[Holometabolism|holometaboly]]"), incomplete metamorphosis ("[[Hemimetabolism|hemimetaboly]]"), or no metamorphosis ("[[Ametabolism|ametaboly]]").

Scientific usage of the term is technically precise, and it is not applied to general aspects of [[cell growth]], including rapid [[puberty|growth spurt]]s. References to "metamorphosis" in [[mammal]]s are imprecise and only colloquial, but historically idealist ideas of transformation and [[monadology]], as in [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] ''[[Metamorphosis of Plants]]'', have influenced the development of ideas of [[evolution]]. 

== Etymology ==
The word ''metamorphosis'' derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|μεταμόρφωσις}}, "transformation, transforming",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2366805 |title=Metamorphosis, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, '&amp;#39;A, at Perseus |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|el|μετα-}} (''{{lang|el|[[meta|meta-]]}}''), "after" and {{lang|el|μορφή}} (''{{lang|el|morphe}}''), "form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Metamorphosis&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hormonal control ==
Metamorphosis is iodothyronine-induced and an ancestral feature of all [[chordate]]s.&lt;ref name="cell.com"/&gt;

In insects growth and metamorphosis are controlled by [[hormone]]s synthesized by [[endocrine gland]]s near the front of the body ([[Anatomical terms of location|anterior]]). Neurosecretory cells in an [[insect brain|insect's brain]] secrete a hormone, the [[prothoracicotropic hormone]] (PTTH) that activates prothoracic glands, which secrete a second hormone, usually [[ecdysone]] (an [[ecdysteroid]]), that induces [[ecdysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 1998. Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
PTTH also stimulates the [[corpora allata]], a retrocerebral organ, to produce [[juvenile hormone]], which prevents the development of adult characteristics during [[ecdysis]].  In holometabolous insects, molts between larval [[instar]]s have a high level of juvenile hormone, the moult to the pupal stage has a low level of juvenile hormone, and the final, or [[imago|imaginal]], molt has no juvenile hormone present at all.&lt;ref&gt;Gullan, P.J. &amp; Cranston, P.S.  6.3 Process and Control of Moulting in ''The Insects: An Outline of Entomology''. Blackwell Publishing,  2005. pp. 153-156.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments on [[Pyrrhocoris apterus|firebugs]] have shown how juvenile hormone can affect the number of nymph instar stages in [[hemimetabolous]] insects.&lt;ref name="SlamaWilliams1965"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slama|last2=Williams|title=Juvenile hormone activity for the bug Pyrrhocoris apterus|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=54 |issue=2 |year=1965 |pages=411–414 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/54/2/411.full.pdf |doi=10.1073/pnas.54.2.411|pmc=219680}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SinghKonopova2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Singh|first1=Amit |last2=Konopova |first2=Barbora |last3=Smykal |first3=Vlastimil |last4=Jindra |first4=Marek |title=Common and Distinct Roles of Juvenile Hormone Signaling Genes in Metamorphosis of Holometabolous and Hemimetabolous Insects |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=12 |year=2011 |pages=e28728 |issn=1932-6203 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0028728 |pmid=22174880 |pmc=3234286}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insects ==
[[File:Grasshoppermetasnodgrass.svg|thumb|Incomplete metamorphosis in the grasshopper with different instar nymphs]]

All three categories of metamorphosis can be found in the diversity of insects, including no metamorphosis ("ametaboly"), incomplete or partial metamorphosis ("hemimetaboly"), and complete metamorphosis ("holometaboly"). While ametabolous insects show very little difference between larval and adult forms (also known as "[[direct development]]"), both hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects have significant morphological and behavioral differences between larval and adult forms, the most significant being the inclusion, in holometabolus organisms, of a [[pupa]]l or resting stage between the [[larval]] and adult forms.

=== Development and terminology ===
[[File:Holometabolous vs. Hemimetabolous.svg|thumb|Two types of metamorphosis are shown. In a complete (holometabolous) metamorphosis the insect passes through four distinct phases, which produce an adult that does not resemble the larva. In an incomplete (hemimetabolous) metamorphosis an insect does not go through a full transformation, but instead transitions from a nymph to an adult by molting its exoskeleton as it grows.]]
In [[Hemimetabolism|hemimetabolous]] [[insects]], immature stages are called [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]].  Development proceeds in repeated stages of growth and [[ecdysis]] (moulting); these stages are called [[instar]]s. The juvenile forms closely resemble adults, but are smaller and lack adult features such as wings and genitalia. The size and morphological differences between nymphs in different instars are small, often just differences in body proportions and the number of segments; in later instars, external wing buds form.

In [[holometabolous]] insects, immature stages are called [[larva]]e and differ markedly from  adults. Insects which undergo holometabolism pass through a larval stage, then enter an inactive state called [[pupa]] (called a [[pupa#Chrysalis|"chrysalis]]" in butterfly species), and finally emerge as adults.&lt;ref name="Lowe"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Metamorphosis revealed: three dimensional imaging inside a living chrysalis |first=Tristan |last=Lowe |first2=Russell P. |last2=Garwood |first3=Thomas |last3=Simonsen |first4=Robert S. |last4=Bradley |first5=Philip J. |last5=Withers |date=July 6, 2013 |journal=Metamorphosis revealed: three dimensional imaging inside a living chrysalis |volume=10 |issue=84 |at=20130304 |url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/10/84/20130304 |accessdate=June 11, 2015 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2013.0304|pmc=3673169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolution ===
The earliest insect forms showed direct development ([[ametabolism]]), and the evolution of metamorphosis in insects is thought to have fuelled their dramatic radiation (1,2). Some early ametabolous "true insects" are still present today, such as [[Archaeognatha|bristletails]] and [[silverfish]]. [[Hemimetabolism|Hemimetabolous]] insects include cockroaches, grasshoppers, dragonflies, and true bugs. Phylogenetically, all insects in the [[Pterygota]] undergo a marked change in form, texture and physical appearance from immature stage to adult. These insects either have [[hemimetabolous]] development, and undergo an incomplete or partial metamorphosis, or [[holometabolous]] development, which undergo a complete metamorphosis, including a [[pupa]]l or resting stage between the [[larval]] and adult forms.&lt;ref name="autogenerated143"&gt;Gullan, P.J. &amp; Cranston, P.S. 6.2 ''Life History Patterns and Phases in The Insects: An Outline of Entomology''.  pp. 143–153. 2005 by Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of holometaboly from hemimetaboly, mostly centering on whether or not the intermediate hemimetabolous forms are homologous to pupal form of holometabolous forms.

More recently,{{When|date=September 2016}} scientific attention has turned to characterizing the mechanistic basis of metamorphosis in terms of its hormonal control, by characterizing spatial and temporal patterns of hormone expression relative to metamorphosis in a wide range of insects.

=== Recent research ===
According to research from 2008, adult ''[[Manduca sexta]]'' is able to retain behavior learned as a [[caterpillar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Douglas J. Blackiston, Elena Silva Casey &amp; Martha R. Weiss |year=2008 |title=Retention of memory through metamorphosis: can a moth remember what it learned as a caterpillar? |journal=[[PLoS ONE]] |volume=3 |issue=3 |page=e1736 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001736 |pmc=2248710 |pmid=18320055 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001736}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another caterpillar, [[Utetheisa ornatrix|the ornate moth caterpillar]], is able to carry toxins that it acquires from its diet through metamorphosis and into adulthood, where the toxins still serve for protection against predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conner|first=W.E.|title=Tiger Moths and Woolly Bears—behaviour, ecology, and evolution of the Arctiidae|year=2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many observations{{When|date=September 2016}} have indicated that [[programmed cell death]] plays a considerable role during physiological processes of multicellular organisms, particularly during [[embryogenesis]] and metamorphosis.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Amphibians ==
[[File:RanaTemporariaLarva2.jpg|thumb|Just before metamorphosis, only 24 hours are needed to reach the stage in the next picture.]]
[[File:Rana Temporaria - Larva Final Stage.jpg|thumb|Almost functional [[common frog]] with some remains of the gill sac and a not fully developed jaw]]

In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and  larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. [[Frogs]], [[toads]], and [[newts]] all hatch from the eggs as larvae with external gills but it will take some time for the amphibians to interact outside with pulmonary respiration. Afterwards, newt larvae  start a predatory lifestyle, while tadpoles mostly scrape food off surfaces with their horny tooth ridges.

Metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by [[thyroxin]] concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and [[prolactin]], which counteracts its effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues. Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body, development is subject to many adaptations due to specific ecological circumstances. For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges for teeth, whiskers, and fins. They also make use of the [[lateral line]] organ. After  metamorphosis, these organs become redundant and will be resorbed by controlled cell death, called [[apoptosis]]. The amount of adaptation to specific ecological circumstances is remarkable, with many discoveries still being made.

=== Frogs and toads ===
With frogs and toads, the external gills of the newly hatched tadpole are covered with a gill sac after a few days, and lungs are quickly formed. Front legs are formed under the gill sac, and hindlegs are visible a few days later. Following that there is usually a longer stage during which the tadpole lives off a vegetarian diet. Tadpoles use a relatively long, spiral‐shaped gut to digest that diet.

Rapid changes in the body can then be observed as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely. The spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is resorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a big jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow  quickly, a tongue is formed, and all this is accompanied by associated changes in the neural networks (development of stereoscopic vision, loss of the lateral line system, etc.) All  this can happen in about a day, so it is truly a metamorphosis. It is not until a few days later that the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxin concentrations required for tail resorption.

=== Salamanders ===
The Salamander development is highly diverse; some species go through a dramatic reorganization when transitioning from aquatic larvae to terrestrial adults, while others, such as the [[Axolotl]], display [[Neoteny|paedomorphosis]] and never develop into terrestrial adults. Within the genus ''[[Ambystoma]]'', species have evolved to be paedomorphic several times, and paedomorphosis and complete development which can both occur in some species.&lt;ref name="Laudet"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laudet | first1 = Vincent | date = September 27, 2011 | title = The Origins and Evolution of Vertebrate Metamorphosis | url = | journal = Current Biology | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = R726–R737 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.07.030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newts ===
[[File:LarveKamsalamander.JPG|thumb|The large external gills of the [[crested newt]]]]

In newts, there is no true metamorphosis {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} because newt larvae already feed as predators and continue doing so as adults. Newts' gills are never covered by a gill sac and will be resorbed only just before the animal leaves the water. Just as in tadpoles, their lungs are functional early, but newts use them less frequently than tadpoles{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}. Newts often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For adaptation to a water phase, [[prolactin]] is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the land phase, [[thyroxin]]. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.

=== Caecilians ===
Basal caecilians such as ''[[Ichthyophis]]'' go through a metamorphosis in which aquatic larva transition into fossorial adults, which involves a loss of the [[lateral line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunker | first1 = Nicole | last2 = Wake | first2 = Marvalee H. | last3 = Olson | first3 = Wendy M. | date = January 2000 | title = Embryonic and Larval Development in the Caecilian Ichthyophis kohtaoensis (Amphibia, Gymnophiona): A Staging Table | url = | journal = Journal of Morphology | volume = 243 | issue = | pages = 3–34 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4687(200001)243:1&lt;3::aid-jmor2&gt;3.3.co;2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently diverged caecilians (the [[Teresomata]]) do not undergo an ontogenetic niche shift of this sort and are in general fossorial throughout their lives. Thus, most caecilians do not undergo an anuran-like metamorphosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = San Mauro | first1 = D. | last2 = Gower | first2 = D. J. | last3 = Oommen | first3 = O. V. | last4 = Wilkinson | first4 = M. | last5 = Zardoya | first5 = R. | date = November 2004 | title = Phylogeny of caecilian amphibians (Gymnophiona) based on complete mitochondrial genomes and nuclear RAG1 | url = | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 413–427 | doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2004.05.014 | pmid=15336675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fish ==
Some fish, both [[Osteichthyes|bony fish (Osteichthyes)]] and [[Agnatha|jawless fish (Agnatha)]], undergo metamorphosis. Fish metamorphosis is typically under strong control by the thyroid hormone.&lt;ref name="Laudet" /&gt;

Examples among the non-bony fish include the [[lamprey]]. Among the bony fish, mechanisms are varied.

The [[salmon]] is [[diadromous]], meaning that it changes from a [[freshwater]] to a [[Seawater|saltwater]] lifestyle.

Many species of [[flatfish]] begin their life [[bilaterally symmetrical]], with an eye on either side of the body; but one eye moves to join the other side of the fish – which becomes the upper side – in the adult form.

The [[European eel]] has a number of metamorphoses, from the larval stage to the [[leptocephalus]] stage, then a quick metamorphosis to glass eel at the edge of the continental shelf (eight days for the Japanese eel), two months at the border of fresh and salt water where the glass eel undergoes a quick metamorphosis into elver, then a long stage of growth followed by a more gradual metamorphosis to the migrating phase. In the pre-adult freshwater stage, the eel also has [[phenotypic plasticity]] because fish-eating eels develop very wide mandibles, making the head look blunt. Leptocephali are common, occurring in all [[Elopomorpha]] (tarpon- and eel-like fish).

Most other bony fish undergo metamorphosis from embryo to larva ([[Fry (biology)|fry]]) and then to the juvenile stage during absorption of the yolk sac, because after that phase the individual needs to be able to feed for itself.&lt;ref&gt;Mader, Sylvia, ''Biology'' 9th ed. Ch. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter B. Moyle and Joseph J. Cech Jr, ''Fishes: an introduction to ichthyology'' 5th ed. 9.3: "Development" pp 148ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizationally it is part of NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], and is currently a multi-tenant complex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacobstechnology.com |title=Jacobs Technology |publisher=Jacobs Technology |date= |accessdate=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow commercial and government contractors, as well as government agencies, to use the site.

MAF is one of the largest manufacturing plants in the world with 43 [[HVAC|environmentally controlled]] acres&amp;mdash;{{convert|174000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}&amp;mdash;under one roof, and it employs more than 4,200 people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/pdf/172203main_MAF_tenant_FS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; From September 1961 to the end of the Apollo program in December 1972 the site was utilized by [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]] to build the first stages of the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn I and Saturn IB]], later joined by [[Boeing|Boeing Corporation]] to build the first stage of the [[Saturn V]] rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fly Chrysler to the Moon: the Saturn Rockets | author = Curtis Redgap | url = http://www.allpar.com/history/military/moon.html  | publisher = Allpar.com | access-date = 2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; From September 5, 1973, to September 20, 2010, the factory was used for the construction of the [[Space Shuttle]]'s [[Space Shuttle external tank|external fuel tanks]] by [[Martin Marietta|Martin Marietta Corporation, Denver Colorado.]]&lt;ref name="etend"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dean|first=James|title=Michoud Declares End Of External Tank Production | url=http://space.flatoday.net/2010/09/michoud-declares-end-of-external-tank.html|publisher=[[Florida Today]]|access-date=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Apmisc-MSFC-6870792.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|alt=A large horizontal rocket with USA painted on the side inside of a manufacturing facility|First stages of [[Saturn V]] rockets being assembled at the Michoud factory in the 1960s]]
The facility was originally constructed in 1940 at the village of [[Michoud, New Orleans|Michoud, Louisiana]], by the Higgins-Tucker division of [[Higgins Industries]] under the direction of [[Andrew Higgins|Andrew Jackson Higgins]]. Construction was done on behalf of the United States government for the war production during [[World War II]] of plywood [[Curtiss-Wright C-76 Caravan|C-76 cargo planes]] and [[landing craft]]. The project cost $180 million ($2.8 billion in 2018).&lt;ref&gt;https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/history-maf&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Korean War]] it made engines for [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]] and [[M46 Patton|Patton]] tanks, and boasted a 5,500 foot paved runway. It came under the management of NASA in 1961, and was used for the construction of the [[S-IC]] first stage of the [[Saturn V]] rockets and the [[S-IB]] first stage of the [[Saturn IB]] rockets built by Chrysler Corporation. It is home to the first stage of the last-constructed Saturn V, SA-515, built by Chrysler Corporation and Boeing Corporation. The facility's height limitation, which was unable to allow the construction of the bigger C-8 direct Moon vehicle, was one of the major reasons why the smaller C-5 (later renamed Saturn V) was chosen instead of the originally planned Moon vehicle.

The majority of the NASA factory's history was focused on construction and production of NASA's [[Space Shuttle external tank]] (ET). Beginning with rollout of ET-1 on June 29, 1979, which flew on [[STS-1]], 136 tanks were produced throughout the Space Shuttle program, ending with the flight-ready tank ET-122, which flew on [[STS-134]], rolled out on September 20, 2010.&lt;ref name="ET-122"&gt;{{cite web|last= Sloss|first=Philip|title=MAF speak of their pride in returning ET-122 to the Shuttle manifest|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2010/09/maf-pride-returning-et-122-shuttle-manifest/|website=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]]|date=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A single tank produced at the facility, ET-94, was not used in spaceflight and remained at Michoud as a [[test article]].&lt;ref name="etend" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tank ET-122 ended up being the last, even though its sequence number was lower than the total number of tanks produced, because it had been damaged during Hurricane Katrina and required repairs prior to completion.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hurricane Katrina ===
[[File:NASA Michoud Katrina Flooding.jpg|thumb|left|A section of eastern New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. MAF (green) is not flooded, while the surrounding neighborhoods (dark greenish brown) are extensively flooded.]]
The facility did not experience significant flooding during [[Hurricane Katrina]] due to a natural [[ridge]] that runs along its northwestern boundary, the [[levee]] that makes up the southern and eastern boundaries, and the work of the pump operators who stayed to protect the facility during the storm. There was wind damage and rainwater damage to several buildings. All shifts were initially canceled up to September 26, 2005, potentially setting back future Shuttle flights. All the buildings and the shuttle hardware within survived the hurricane without grave damage, but the roof of the main manufacturing building was breached and debris damaged ET-122 stored inside; that tank was refurbished and later flew on the final flight of [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']], [[STS-134]]. Thirty-eight NASA and Lockheed Martin employees stayed behind during Hurricane Katrina to operate the pumping systems, knowing that if not activated and sustained, the facility would have been destroyed. The workers pumped more than one billion gallons (3,800,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of water out of the facility and probably were the reason that the rocket factory suffered very little damage. These employees were each awarded the [[NASA Exceptional Bravery Medal]], NASA's highest bravery award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | title = NASA Administrator Honors Katrina Heroes | date = 2006-01-05 | url = http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/maf_rideout.html | publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 2005 [[NASA]] announced that the repairs were progressing faster than anticipated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | date = 2005-09-16 | publisher = NASA | title = NASA Planning to Resume Work at Michoud Assembly Facility | url = http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/sep/HQ_05268_Resume_Work_Michoud.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so they would continue to use Michoud for external tank work. On October 3, 2005, the facility officially reopened for essential personnel, though some key personnel had returned earlier. On October 31 the facility reopened to all personnel.

On February 7, 2017, an [[2017 New Orleans tornado|EF3]] tornado carved a path through [[New Orleans|Orleans Parish]], in which the factory is located. Two major buildings including the main manufacturing building were damaged, with multiple broken windows. 5 people were injured, and resulting repairs and other factors contributed to the delay of the first SLS launch until 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/michoud/workers-repair-roof-damage-to-nasa-s-rocket-factory |title=Workers Repair Roof Damage to NASA’s Rocket Factory &amp;#124; NASA |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2017-02-07 |accessdate=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan Billow |url=http://www.wesh.com/article/nasa-rocket-factory-damaged-by-violent-winds/8694938 |title=NASA rocket factory damaged by violent winds |publisher=Wesh.com |date=2017-02-08 |accessdate=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buildings ==
[[File:SLS Liquid Oxygen Tank Hardware in Welding.jpg|thumb|right|Welding of the SLS liquid oxygen tank in the South Vertical Assembly Building]]
The facility consists of four large buildings in one complex:

*   Building 1 comprises the main manufacturing building (Building number 103), and the North and South Vertical Assembly Buildings (Building numbers 115 and 110 respectively). The North VAB was constructed in 2011, initially to add new vertical welding equipment. The main manufacturing building is where the majority of preliminary fabrication and welding activities take place - the Space Launch System core stage (and previously the [[Space Shuttle External Tank]] and [[S-IC|Saturn V first stage]]) were manufactured. The building stretches 512 meters by 340 meters in dimensions, and contains over 40 sub-areas for different manufacturing and structural assembly operations. A series of internal roads made from polished concrete provide ease of access by factory vehicles, trams, and overhead cranes to move components around. They run the whole length of the factory building. Factory floor office buildings and engineering rooms are located in various ends of the main manufacturing building. Near the South VAB is an electric arc furnace and casting equipment. In front of the main manufacturing building is the administration offices, lobby, restaurants and engineering conference rooms. There is also a gym, retail stores, media lab, a medical area and a large cafeteria provided for the workers.&lt;ref&gt;https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/node/268&lt;/ref&gt; Facing north is a factory floor museum display area, with mission patches, flags and memorials.&lt;ref&gt;https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/amenities&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/node/286&lt;/ref&gt;
*   Building 2 is an external building that is used to manufacture smaller components and space station equipment, for example small components for the [[International Space Station]]. It also supplies various small components such as fasteners to the main building.&lt;ref&gt;https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/file/533&lt;/ref&gt;
*   Building 3 is another external building for various manufacturing processes, and contains a laboratory, office space and technical storage areas.&lt;ref&gt;https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/file/535&lt;/ref&gt; Building 3-20 is the employees dormitory building, and contains a restaurant and offices.
*   Building 4 is located south of the complex. It is an industrial workshop for the processing and application of spray-on insulation foam to SLS tank components. Space Shuttle external tank spares were also housed there.&lt;ref&gt;https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/file/529&lt;/ref&gt;
*   Adjacent to the main manufacturing building are more foam application workshops, power transformers for the arc furnace and other facilities, and large amounts of open space. In front of the South VAB, rocket parts are moved from this building to the side internal workshops across the plaza for inspection and checks. The SLS core stage test simulator (made of steel) is also located in this area.
*   The National Finance Center (NSF) - located west of the complex; houses offices for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and contains several large conference rooms, a restaurant and a ballroom for NASA employees and visitor events.

The shipping port is located 600 meters southwest of the main manufacturing building. Transporting vehicles carrying manufactured SLS components move down Saturn Blvd, past large open fields, to the pier - where the Pegasus Barge is docked. This is where the components are shipped to their final destination - [[Kennedy Space Center]], or rarely back to the main [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] in Huntsville, Alabama.

== Other and future activities ==
The Michoud Assembly Facility also houses other organizations such as the [[National Finance Center]] operated by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], the [[United States Coast Guard]], Blade Dynamics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bladedynamics.com Blade Dynamics]&lt;/ref&gt; the Chris A. Hadfield Rocket Factory,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/chris-hadfield&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lockheed Martin]] and NASA. The factory is now the location for the [[Space Launch System]] (SLS) being built by the Boeing company which will be the most powerful rocket in the history of spaceflight. It will carry the Orion spacecraft during its first launch to prove capabilities. Launch is set for early 2019.

The factory complex is open to public visitation, visitors need to sign in at the main reception and clear security.&lt;ref&gt;https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/visitors-maf&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA planned to use the rocket factory to build the structure for several components of the cancelled [[Constellation program]], including the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion spacecraft]], the [[Ares I]] [[Ares I#Design|Upper Stage]], and the [[Ares V]] Core Stage. Under the Obama administration, the Constellation Program was cancelled in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/9305-president-obama-signs-vision-space-exploration-law.html "President Obama Signs New Vision for U.S. Space Exploration Into Law"]. Space.com, October 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but was replaced with SLS a year later to continue space exploration efforts.

NASA has an agreement in place to rent out a portion of the facility to Big Easy Studios, a New Orleans film studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwltv.com/news/local/Michoud-Facility-in-NO-East-becoming-hub-for-major-film-productions-138522804.html WWLTV News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221181134/http://www.wwltv.com/news/local/Michoud-Facility-in-NO-East-becoming-hub-for-major-film-productions-138522804.html |date=2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This deal as been criticized by competing studios as violating NASA's rule that any deal with an outside entity must serve the agency's mission and must not compete with the private sector.  NASA officials defend the agreement, stating that this helps to offset the cost of unused space on the facility and that their pricing is vetted by state and local economic development agencies to ensure it is not competing with the private market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.businessreport.com/article/20120917/BUSINESSREPORT0112/120919831/ | title = NASA defends deal with N.O. film studio | author = David Jacobs | date = 2012-09-17 | publisher = Greater Baton Rouge Business Report | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140515011909/http://www.businessreport.com/article/20120917/BUSINESSREPORT0112/120919831/ | archivedate = 2014-05-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of ''[[Ender's Game (film)|Ender's Game]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Ender’s Game filmed at NASA Michoud Assembly Facility | author = Jim Cheng | url = http://www.emersiondesign.com/news/enders-game-filmed-at-nasa-michoud-assembly-facility-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[G.I.

==Incidents ==

[[TACA Flight 110]] operated with a [[Boeing 737-300]] jetliner made a successful emergency landing on a grassy [[levee]] in the Michoud grounds after power was lost in both engines during a severe thunderstorm. The aircraft was towed into the Michoud facility, where its engines were replaced. On 6 June, it took off, with a crew of two and minimal fuel, using the former runway at Michoud,&lt;ref name="UPI"&gt;{{cite web |title=Emergency-shortened flight is completed |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/06/06/Emergency-shortened-flight-is-completed/6569581572800/ |publisher=UPI |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=en |date=June 6, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been reused as a road, Saturn Boulevard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Coord|30.0164|-89.9204|region:US|name=Saturn Boulevard}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was flown the short distance to New Orleans International Airport, where it was repaired.&lt;ref name="UPI" /&gt;
Over the years, several reported incidents of robbery and terrorism occurred at the facility; where trespassers on numerous occasions have been known to break in and have stolen technical paperwork. As a result, public visitors and employees taking photographs inside is highly regulated by NASA officials. There was a recent bomb threat to MAF; and after 9/11, double-perimeter security fences were installed in 2007-2008. At the same time, all of the front windows of the administration offices were upgraded with black-anodized shatter-proof transparent panels.

A '''mortuary enclosure''' is a term given in [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] to an area, surrounded by a wood, stone or earthwork barrier, in which dead bodies are placed for [[excarnation]] and to await secondary and/or collective burial. There are some parallels with [[mortuary house]]s although the two are the products of different cultural practices and traditions regarding the treatment of the dead.

The mortuary enclosures of the British [[Neolithic]] were sub-rectangular banks with external ditches and raised platforms of stone or wood within them, thought to be used for the exposure of corpses prior to burial elsewhere. Remains of mortuary enclosures of this period are often found under [[long barrow]]s.

In art and [[iconography]], a '''motif''' {{Audio|en-us-motif.ogg|(pronunciation)}} is an element of an [[image]].  A motif may be repeated in a [[pattern]] or design, often many times, or may just occur once in a work.&lt;ref name=LatinArt&gt;{{cite web |title=Art glossary |url=http://www.latinart.com/glossary.cfm?sort=M |publisher=LatinArt.com |accessdate=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of motif==

A motif may be an element in the iconography of a particular subject or type of subject that is seen in other works, or may form the main subject, as the [[Master of Animals]] motif in ancient art typically does. The related motif of [[confronted animals]] is often seen alone, but may also be repeated, for example in [[Byzantine silk]] and other ancient textiles.  Where the main subject of an artistic work such as a painting is a specific person, group, or moment in a narrative, that should be referred to as the "subject" of the work, not a motif, though the same thing may be a "motif" when part of another subject, or part of a work of [[decorative art]] such as a painting on a vase.

[[Ornament (art)|Ornament]]al or [[decorative art]] can usually be analysed into a number of different elements, which can be called motifs. These may often, as in [[Fiber art|textile art]], be repeated many times in a pattern. Important examples in Western art include [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]], [[egg and dart]],&lt;ref&gt;Lucy T. Shoe, ''Profiles of Greek Mouldings'' 1936, supplemented by Shoe, "Greek Mouldings of Kos and Rhodes", ''Hesperia'' '''19'''.4 (October - December 1950:338-369 and illustrations)&lt;/ref&gt; and various types of [[scrollwork]].

[[File:Elibelinde2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Elibelinde]] [[kilim motifs]], symbolising [[fertility]]]]

Many designs in [[Islamic culture]] are motifs, including those of the sun, moon, animals such as horses and lions, flowers, and landscapes. Motifs can have emotional effects and be used for propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctc.usma.edu/pdf/CTC%20--%20Islamic%20Imagery%20Project.pdf Motifs in Jihadi Internet Propaganda]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[kilim]] flatwoven carpets, [[kilim motifs|motifs]] such as the hands-on-hips [[elibelinde]] are woven in to the design to express the hopes and concerns of the weavers: the elibelinde symbolises the female principle and [[fertility]], including the desire for children.&lt;ref name=Erbek&gt;{{cite book |author=Erbek, Güran |title=Kilim Catalogue No. 1 |publisher =May Selçuk A.

[[File:IntegrityBarnstar.png|thumb|[[Pennsylvania Dutch]] motif known as a [[hex sign]]]]
Pennsylvania Dutch hex signs are a familiar type of motif in the eastern portions of the United States. Their circular and symmetric design, and their use of brightly colored patterns from nature, such as stars, compass roses, doves, hearts, tulips, leaves, and feathers have made them quite popular. In some parts of Pennsylvania Dutch country, it is common to see these designs decorating barns and covered bridges.

The idea of a motif has become used more broadly in discussing [[literature]] and other narrative arts for [[Motif (narrative)|an element in the story]] that represents a [[theme (arts)|theme]].&lt;ref name="Grayson"&gt;James H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8670">The '''Opificio delle pietre dure''', literally meaning ''Workshop of semi-precious stones'', is a public institute of the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities (Italy)|Ministry for Cultural Heritage]] based in [[Florence]]. It is a global leader in the field of [[art restoration]] and provides teaching as one of two Italian state conservation schools (the other being the [[Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro]]). The institute maintains also a specialist library and archive of conservation and a museum displaying historic examples of [[Pietra dura|pietre dure]] inlaid semi-precious stones artefacts. A scientific laboratory conducts research and diagnostics and provides a preventive conservation service.

==Origins and early history ==
[[Image:Cathedral Virgin Mary-7.jpg|thumb|Altar decorated in ''[[commesso]]'', (Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (Velika Gospa), [[Dubrovnik]])]]
Being one of the famous artistic workshops of the [[Italian Renaissance]], the Opificio was established in 1588 at the behest of [[Ferdinando I de' Medici]] to provide the elaborate, inlaid precious and semi-precious stoneworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = OPD Museum | url = http://www.firenzemusei.it/00_english/opificio/index.html | accessdate = 2011-02-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110109123911/http://www.firenzemusei.it/00_english/opificio/index.html | archivedate = 2011-01-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the masterpieces of the crafts is the overall decoration of the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze#Cappelle Medicee|Cappella dei Principi]] (Chapel of Princes) in the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze]]. The technique, which originated from [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[inlay]] work, was perfected by the Opificio masters and the artworks they produced became known as "opera di commessi medicei" (''[[commesso (art technique)|commesso]]'' is the old name of the technique, similar to ancient mosaics) and later as "commesso in pietre dure" (semi-precious stones mosaic).

The artisans performed the exceptionally skilled and delicate task of inlaying thin veneers of semi-precious stones especially selected for their colour, opacity, brilliance and grain to create elaborate decorative and pictorial effects. Items of extraordinary refinement were created in this way, from furnishings to all manner of artworks. Today, artisans trained at the Opificio assist many of the world's museums in their restoration programmes.

The Opificio workshops were originally located in the [[Casino Mediceo. Florence|Casino Mediceo]], then in the [[Uffizi]] and were finally moved to their present location in Via Alfani in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = OPD Museum | url = http://www.firenzemusei.it/00_english/opificio/index.html | accessdate = 2011-02-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110109123911/http://www.firenzemusei.it/00_english/opificio/index.html | archivedate = 2011-01-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the 19th Century the institute's activities moved away from the production of works of art and towards its restoration. At first specialising in [[hardstone carving]], in which the workshops were a world authority, and then later expanding into other related fields (stone and marble sculptures, bronzes, ceramics).

==Recent history==

The second branch of the Institute (baboratori di restauro) had a more modern story. In 1932 [[Ugo Procacci]], the distinghished scholar of Florentine art, in his career as an officer of the Italian Ministry for Cultural Heritage, founded a Laboratory of restoration (original Italian name: ''Gabinetto di restauro'') at the Florence Soprintendenza. It was the first modern restoration laboratory in Italy (pre-dating of 7 years the [[Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro]] in Rome) and one of the very first ones in all the world.
The Gabinetto di Restauro used scientific methods for the preliminary exhaminition of the works of art (as X radiography) and began an outstanding campaign of restoration on Tuscan Early Masters paintings, that was later known as "restauri di rivelazione" (literally meaning ''revealing restoration'').

&lt;!---[[image:Fortezza lab.jpg|thumb|right|Inside the laboratory at the [[Fortezza da Basso]].]] not at the commons yet---&gt;
In 1966, the fatal tragedy of the [[flood of the River Arno in Florence|flooding of the River Arno]], resulted in many priceless works of art requiring restoration. It provided a significant impetus for expansion of the Gabinetto di restauro's research and restorative services. More space was needed because of the sheer number of artworks which required restoration and also, in some cases, the large size of the pieces themselves, such as the immense 4.48 x 3.9m [[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|Crucifix]] by [[Cimabue]] from the [[Basilica di Santa Croce]]. The expansions provided new laboratories in the [[Fortezza da Basso]]. 
Thanks to financial aid and an influx of expertise from throughout the world, the Florentine Laboratory became, in a short time one of the vanguard restoration laboratories in the world, combining traditional practices with modern technology.

In 1975, the Cultural Heritage Ministry merged the Opificio laboratories with the Gabinetto di restauro (plus other minor Florentine restoration laboratories) and created a new Institute, the modern ''Opificio delle pietre dure''.

Today, the institute is organised in departments specific for the various types of artworks it treats. The laboratories are in three principal venues: in Via Alfani 78, in the historic centre of Florence; in the [[Fortezza da Basso]];  and in [[Palazzo Vecchio]] where restoration treatments on tapestries and textiles are carried out.
There are also several research and services offices.

The actual (updated on march, 26, 2012) Superintendent is  Marco Ciatti.
The Opificio has a board of directors of the departments, under the supervision of the Supertintendent.
It has also a gestional committee and a scientific committee.

===Departments===
*Tapestries and carpets
*Bronzes and ancient weapons
*Wooden sculptures
*Wall painting
*Drawings and prints
*Stoneworks
*Pietre dure mosaics
*Jewelry
*Easel paintings
*Terracotta and potteries
*Textiles

==Museum==
[[Image:Opificio delle pietre dure, ingresso.JPG|thumb]]
The small museum in the Via Alfani displays examples of pietre dure works, including cabinets, table tops and plates, showing an immense repertoire of decoration, usually either flowers, fruits and animals, but also sometimes other picturesque scenes, including a famous view of the [[Piazza della Signoria]]. There is also a large baroque fireplace entirely covered in [[malachite]], a dazzling and brilliant green stone as well as copies of painting executed in inlaid stone. Some of the exhibition space is dedicated to particular types of stone, such as the [[paesina]], extracted near Florence, the grain and colour of which can be used to create vivid landscapes.

An exhibition of the technical processes of pietre dure works through history, can be found on the first floor as well as a large range of finished works dating back to the time of the Medici. There are vases and furnishings decorated with [[Art Nouveau]] designs of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including a tabletop with a harp and garland by [[Emilio Zocchi]] (1849) and another decorated with flowers and birds by [[Niccolò Betti]] (1855).

It has been required reading at many film schools, including the [[University of Southern California|University of Southern California (USC)]].&lt;ref name="USC"&gt;{{cite web|title=SYLLABUS: MuIN 499, The Recording Console|url=http://web-app.usc.edu/soc/syllabus/20143/44388.pdf|website=[[University of Southern California]] (USC)|accessdate=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was also awarded five out of five stars by ''[[Videomaker Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="VM3rdEd"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parr|first1=Morgan|title=New Titles Reviews|work=[[Videomaker Magazine]]|issue=September, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When released, ''Millimeter Magazine'' noted that the book was one of very few publications extensively covering the art of capturing motion picture sound.&lt;ref name="Mil"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Katz|first1=S.D.|title=Essential Reading for DV Filmmakers|work=Millimeter Magazine|date=February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Producing Great Sound for Film and Video'' has been called, "...''the'' book on the subject."&lt;ref name="Stockman2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Stockman|title=How to Shoot Video That Doesn't Suck|page=247|year=2011|publisher=Workman Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-7611-6323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
In the opening of the book, Rose states:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;The heart of this book is the tricks, shortcuts and industry practices developed over nearly a century, since the beginning of radio and talking pictures.  In the 40-some years I've been at this, I've worked on tracks ranging from sales videos to theatrical features...and seen my projects win Clios, an Emmy, and hundreds of other awards...This book is an attempt to share as much as I can.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
''Producing Great Sound for Film and Video'' is broken into four main sections, ordered to reflect real-world filming situations:  
*Audio Basics
*Planning and Pre-Production
*Production Sound
*Post Production

Subjects covered include [[Analog recording|analog]] versus [[digital audio]], [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]] and using [[sound effect]]s, microphone techniques, [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|ADR]], [[Audio mixing|mixing]], and [[Audio mastering|mastering]].

One section highlighted as unique by ''[[Videomaker Magazine]]'' was that on "editing voices."&lt;ref name="VM3rdEd" /&gt;  Rose breaks down how human speech works, and how that translates to film and video productions.  Tips include stealing unvoiced sounds from other characters or people speaking in a scene, and using them to replace problematic recordings of others.  The "editing voices" section also discusses sounds with "hard attacks" and training the ear to hear [[phoneme]]s, which helps in isolating and correcting speech recording issues.

Numerous "recipes" for dealing with common sound issues, such as reducing or eliminating echo on sets, and removing line hum and buzz from recorded audio, are also provided.

Eliva Silva writing for ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'' said of the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[It is] the whole theory -- and beautiful theory -- on the science of audio and the way that audio is recorded through voltage, converted into digital information, back to voltage into sound.&lt;ref name="SAE"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silva|first1=Eliva|title=So Whatcha Doin'? Pablo Véliz|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/11358CB5E1908398?p=AWNB|work=San Antonio Express-News|date=August 6, 2006|accessdate=February 15, 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fIoToQCM|archivedate=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Style ==
Author Rose states in the book that he wishes to appeal to technical and non-technical people alike, adding he hopes to keep the book approachable and conversational in tone, dispelling the idea that audio needs to be difficult to understand.  He states that audio is not "rocket science." While the book does contain math and science, Rose points out the math is elementary school level and the physics is "common sense."

The current version of the book provides downloadable files including sample sounds and music, diagnostic tools and additional tutorials allowing the reader to practice with the principles explained. Earlier versions of the book included a CD-ROM of similar assets.

In 2003, ''Millimeter Magazine'' felt the style was right for the time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Digital artists are very much hands-on, and Rose is the right man to write audio books for this new generation of filmmakers. Rose operates his own boutique sound studio and bridges the analog and digital eras - he's made the discoveries and mistakes that no one should have to learn on the job. This direct experience with DV equipment and projects is apparent throughout the book.&lt;ref name="Mil" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Critical reviews ===
Covering the first edition of the book, ''[[Videomaker Magazine]]'' noted the high price tag of the book, but said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;With PBS and Turner Network Television production experience under his belt, author Jay Rose brings a wealth of experience to ''Producing Great Sound for Digital Video''...the book is replete with facts and useful information.&lt;ref name="VideoMaker1stEd" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of the second edition, ''Millimeter Magazine'' said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Shortchanging film sound is typical of new filmmakers, and the emphasis on picture over sound is a bias running through film schools and film publications - articles, books, and courses on visual subjects far outnumber those on film sound. Author Jay Rose is single-handedly addressing the problem.&lt;ref name="Mil" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Hartney writing for ''[[Creative COW]]'' said of the second edition, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...it offers such a wide range of usable information about hands-on digital audio production, that by reading it, the reader is empowered with production skills and enlightened by an appreciation of how the experience of audio enriches video.&lt;ref name="COW"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hartney|first1=John|title=John Hartney reviews: Producing Great Sound for Digital Video, Second edition|url=https://library.creativecow.net/articles/hartney_john/jay_rose_audio.php|website=[[Creative COW]]|accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2008, covering the third edition of the book, ''[[Videomaker Magazine]]'' awarded it "five out of five stars" and said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been looking for this book for 20 years - no exaggeration...The chapter on Editing Voices alone is worth the price tag.&lt;ref name="VM3rdEd" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Entertainment industry reviews ===
Academy Award winner [[Randy Thom]] (director of Sound Design at [[Skywalker Sound]],&lt;ref name="SkySoundThmo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Randy Thom|url=http://www.skysound.com/people/randy-thom/|website=[[Skywalker Sound]]|accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oscar winner for ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' and ''[[The Incredibles]]''&lt;ref name="IMDBThom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Randy Thom - Awards|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0858378/awards|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) wrote praise of the author and book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Jay Rose is one of the leaders in spreading the gospel of using sound creatively. He presents cutting-edge ideas about the collaboration of sound and image, and also covers the basics… all in an easy to read, easy to understand style.&lt;ref name="PubSite" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominated sound mixer [[Jeff Wexler]]&lt;ref name="IMDbWexler"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeff Wexler Awards|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0923306/awards|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]], [[The Last Samurai]], [[Fight Club]]'') wrote a blurb for the book stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This is the definitive book. It should be mandatory reading for anyone who is seriously considering a career making movies."&lt;ref name="PubSite" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Radiosurgery''' is [[surgery]] using [[radiation]],&lt;ref name="Dorlands"&gt;{{Citation |author=Elsevier |authorlink=Elsevier |title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |publisher=Elsevier |url=http://dorlands.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, the destruction of precisely selected areas of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] using [[ionizing radiation]] rather than excision with a blade. Like other forms of [[radiation therapy]] (also called radiotherapy), it is usually used to treat [[cancer]]. Radiosurgery was originally defined by the Swedish neurosurgeon [[Lars Leksell]] as "a single high dose fraction of radiation, stereotactically directed to an intracranial region of interest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leksell|first=Lars|title=The stereotaxic method and radiosurgery of the brain|journal=Acta Chirurgica Scandinavica|date=December 1951 |volume=102|issue=4|pages=316–9|pmid=14914373}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In '''[[stereotactic surgery|stereotactic radiosurgery]]''' ('''SRS'''), the word "stereotactic" refers to a three-dimensional [[coordinate system]] that enables accurate correlation of a virtual target seen in the patient's diagnostic images with the actual target position in the patient.

When used outside the CNS it may be called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR).&lt;ref name=SBRT/&gt;

Technological improvements in medical imaging and computing have led to increased clinical adoption of stereotactic radiosurgery and have broadened its scope in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=De Salles|first=A|title=Radiosurgery from the brain to the spine: 20 years experience|journal=Acta Neurochirurgica.

In the 21st century the original concept of radiosurgery  expanded to include treatments comprising up to five fractions, and stereotactic radiosurgery has been redefined as a distinct neurosurgical discipline that utilizes externally generated ionizing radiation to inactivate or eradicate defined targets, typically in the head or spine, without the need for a surgical incision.&lt;ref name=barnett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnett|first=Gene H.|title=Stereotactic radiosurgery-an organized neurosurgery-sanctioned definition|journal=Journal of Neurosurgery|year=2007|volume=106|issue=1|pages=1–5|doi=10.3171/jns.2007.106.1.1|pmid=17240553}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Irrespective of the similarities between the concepts of stereotactic radiosurgery and [[Dose fractionation|fractionated]] radiotherapy the intent of both approaches is fundamentally different, although both treatment modalities are reported to have identical outcomes for certain indications.&lt;ref name=combs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Combs|first=Stephanie|title=Differences in clinical results after LINAC-based single-dose radiosurgery versus fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for patients with vestibular schwannomas|journal=International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics|year=2010|volume=76|issue=1|pages=193–200|doi=10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.01.064|pmid=19604653}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of stereotactic radiosurgery is to destroy target tissue while preserving adjacent normal tissue, where fractionated radiotherapy relies on a different sensitivity of the target and the surrounding normal tissue to the [[Absorbed dose|total accumulated radiation dose]].&lt;ref name=barnett/&gt; Historically, the field of fractionated radiotherapy evolved from the original concept of stereotactic radiosurgery following discovery of the principles of [[radiobiology]]: repair, reassortment, repopulation, and reoxygenation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernier|first=Jacques|title=Radiation oncology: a century of achievements|journal=Nature Reviews.

==History==
Stereotactic radiosurgery was first developed in 1949 by the Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell to treat small targets in the brain that were not amenable to conventional surgery. The initial stereotactic instrument he conceived used probes and electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leksell|first=Lars|title=A stereotaxic apparatus for intracerebral surgery|journal=Acta Chirurgica Scandinavica|year=1949|volume=99|pages=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first attempt to supplant the electrodes with radiation was made in the early fifties, with [[x-ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leksell|first=Lars|title=The stereotaxic method and radiosurgery of the brain|journal=Acta Chirurgica Scandinavica|date=December 1951|volume=102|issue=4|pages=316–9|pmid=14914373}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of this instrument was to hit the intra-cranial target with narrow beams of radiation from multiple directions. The beam paths converge in the target volume, delivering a lethal cumulative dose of radiation there, while limiting the dose to the adjacent healthy tissue. Ten years later significant progress had been made, due in considerable measure to the contribution of the physicists Kurt Liden and Börje Larsson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsson|first=Borje|title=The high-energy proton beam as a neurosurgical tool|journal=Nature|year=1958|volume=182|issue=4644|pages=1222–3|pmid=13590280|doi=10.1038/1821222a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time, stereotactic [[proton]] beams had replaced the x-rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leksell|first=Lars|title=Lesions in the depth of the brain produced by a beam of high energy protons|journal=Acta Radiologica|date=October 1960|volume=54|issue=4|pages=251–64|pmid=13760648|doi=10.3109/00016926009172547}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy particle beam presented as an excellent replacement for the surgical knife, but the [[synchrocyclotron]] was too clumsy. Leksell proceeded to develop a practical, compact, precise and simple tool which could be handled by the surgeon himself. In 1968 this resulted in the Gamma Knife, which was installed at the [[Karolinska Institutet|Karolinska Institute]] and consisted of several [[cobalt-60]] [[radioactivity|radioactive]] sources placed in a kind of helmet with central channels for irradiation with gamma rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leksell|first=Lars|title=Stereotactic Radiosurgery|journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry|date=September 1983|volume=46|issue=9|pages=797–803|pmid=6352865|doi=10.1136/jnnp.46.9.797|pmc=1027560}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prototype was designed to produce slit-like radiation lesions for functional neurosurgical procedures to treat pain, movement disorders, or behavioral disorders that did not respond to conventional treatment. The success of this first unit led to the construction of a second device, containing 179 cobalt-60 sources. This second Gamma Knife unit was designed to produce spherical lesions to treat brain tumors and intracranial [[arteriovenous malformation]]s (AVMs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wu|first=Andrew|title=Physics of Gamma Knife approach on convergent beams in stereotactic radiosurgery|journal=International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics|date=April 1990|volume=18|issue=4|pages=941–949|doi=10.1016/0360-3016(90)90421-f}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s the third and fourth units (with 201 cobalt-60 sources) were installed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Sheffield, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walton|first=L|title=The Sheffield stereotactic radiosurgery unit: physical characteristics and principles of operation|journal=British Journal of Radiology|year=1987|volume=60|issue=717|pages=897–906|doi=10.1259/0007-1285-60-717-897|pmid=3311273}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth Gamma Knife was installed at the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] in [[Pittsburgh]] in 1987.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In parallel to these developments, a similar approach was designed for a [[linear particle accelerator]] or Linac. Installation of the first 4&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]] clinical linear accelerator began in June 1952 in the Medical Research Council (MRC) Radiotherapeutic Research Unit at the [[Hammersmith Hospital]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fry|first=D.W.|title=A traveling wave linear accelerator for 4 MeV electrons|journal=Nature|year=1948|volume=162|pages=859–61|pmid=18103121|issue=4126|doi=10.1038/162859a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was handed over for physics and other testing in February 1953 and began to treat patients on 7 September that year. Meanwhile, work at the Stanford Microwave Laboratory led to the development of a 6-MV accelerator, which was installed at Stanford University Hospital, California, in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernier|first=J|title=Radiation oncology: a century of achievements|journal=Nature Reviews.

In 1982, the Spanish neurosurgeon J. Barcia-Salorio began to evaluate the role of cobalt-generated and then Linac-based photon radiosurgery for the treatment of AVMs and [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barcia-Salorio|first=J.L.|title=Radiosurgical treatment of carotid-cavernous fistula|journal=Applied Neurophysiology|year=1982|volume=45|issue=4–5|pages=520–522|doi=10.1159/000101675}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Betti and Derechinsky described a Linac-based radiosurgical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Betti|first=O.O.|title=Hyperselective encephalic irradiation with a linear accelerator|journal=Acta Neurochirurgica Supplement (Wien)|year=1984|volume=33|pages=385–390|doi=10.1007/978-3-7091-8726-5_60|isbn=978-3-211-81773-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winston and Lutz further advanced Linac-based radiosurgical prototype technologies by incorporating an improved stereotactic positioning device and a method to measure the accuracy of various components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winston|first=K.R.|title=Linear accelerator as a neurosurgical tool for stereotactic radiosurgery|journal=Neurosurgery|year=1988|volume=22|issue=3|pages=454–464|doi=10.1227/00006123-198803000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a modified Linac, the first patient in the United States was treated in Boston [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] in February 1986.

Today, both Gamma Knife and Linac radiosurgery programs are commercially available worldwide. While the Gamma Knife is dedicated to radiosurgery, most Linacs are built for conventional fractionated radiotherapy and require additional technology and expertise to become dedicated radiosurgery tools. This is exemplified by the [http://www.novalistxradiosurgery.com Novalis Radiosurgery Program], designed to complement conventional Linacs with sophisticated beam-shaping technology, treatment planning,  and image-guidance tools to provide highest treatment accuracy. An example of a dedicated radiosurgery Linac is the [[CyberKnife]], a compact Linac mounted onto a robotic arm that moves around the patient and irradiates the tumor from a large set of fixed positions, thereby mimicking the Gamma Knife concept.

==Clinical applications==
When used outside the CNS it may be called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR).&lt;ref name=SBRT&gt;[http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/treatment/radiotherapy/external/stereotactic-body-radiotherapy-sabr Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central nervous system===
Radiosurgery is performed by a multidisciplinary team of [[neurosurgeons]], [[radiation oncologist]]s and medical [[physicist]]s to operate and maintain highly sophisticated, highly precise and complex instruments, including medical linear accelerators, the Gamma Knife unit and the Cyberknife unit. The highly precise irradiation of targets within the brain and spine is planned using information from medical images that are obtained via [[computed tomography]], [[magnetic resonance imaging]], and [[angiography]].

Radiosurgery is indicated primarily for the therapy of tumors, vascular lesions and functional disorders.  Significant clinical judgment must be used with this technique and considerations must include lesion type, pathology if available, size, location and age and general health of the patient.  General contraindications to radiosurgery include excessively large size of the target lesion, or lesions too numerous for practical treatment. Patients can be treated within one to five days as [[outpatient]]s. By comparison, the average hospital stay for a [[craniotomy]] (conventional neurosurgery, requiring the opening of the skull) is about 15 days. The radiosurgery outcome may not be evident until months after the treatment. Since radiosurgery does not remove the tumor but inactivates it biologically, lack of growth of the lesion is normally considered to be treatment success. General indications for radiosurgery include many kinds of brain tumors, such as [[acoustic neuroma]]s, [[germinoma]]s, [[meningioma]]s, [[metastases]], trigeminal neuralgia, arteriovenous malformations, and skull base tumors, among others. Expansion of stereotactic radiotherapy to extracranial lesions is increasing, and includes metastases, liver cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc.

===Mechanism of action===
[[Image:Acoustic schwannoma gamma knife.jpg|right|thumb|Planning [[CT scan]] with IV contrast in a patient with left cerebellopontine angle [[vestibular schwannoma]]]]
The fundamental principle of radiosurgery is that of selective [[ionization]] of tissue, by means of high-energy beams of radiation. Ionization is the production of [[ion]]s and [[free radicals]] which are damaging to the [[cell (biology)|cells]]. These ions and radicals, which may be formed from the water in the cell or biological materials, can produce irreparable damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, resulting in the cell's death. Thus, biological inactivation is carried out in a volume of tissue to be treated, with a precise destructive effect. The radiation dose is usually measured in [[Gray (unit)|grays]] (one gray (Gy) is the absorption of one [[joule]] of energy per kilogram of mass). A unit that attempts to take into account both the different organs that are irradiated and the type of radiation is the [[sievert]], a unit that describes both the amount of energy deposited and the biological effectiveness.

===Risks===
''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in December 2010 that radiation overdoses had occurred with the linear accelerator method of radiosurgery, due in large part to inadequate safeguards in equipment retrofitted for stereotactic radiosurgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/health/29radiation.html | title = A Pinpoint Beam Strays Invisibly, Harming Instead of Healing | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2010-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates these devices, whereas the Gamma Knife is regulated by the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]. The ''NYT'' article focused on [[Varian Medical Systems|Varian]] equipment and associated software, but the problem is likely not to be limited to that manufacturer.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

This is evidence that [[Cancer immunotherapy|immunotherapy]] may be useful for treatment of radiation necrosis following stereotactic radiotherapy.&lt;ref name="pmid28368903"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaidar-Person O, Zagar TM, Deal A, Moschos SJ, Ewend MG, Sasaki-Adams D, Lee CB, Collichio FA, Fried D, Marks LB, Chera BS |title=The incidence of radiation necrosis following stereotactic radiotherapy for melanoma brain metastases: the potential impact of immunotherapy |journal=Anticancer Drugs |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=669–675 |date=July 2017 |pmid=28368903 |doi=10.1097/CAD.0000000000000497 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of radiation source ==
The selection of the proper kind of radiation and device depends on many factors including lesion type, size, and location in relation to critical structures.  Data suggest that similar clinical outcomes are possible with all of the various techniques.  More important than the device used are issues regarding indications for treatment, total dose delivered, fractionation schedule and conformity of the treatment plan.

=== Gamma Knife ===
{{redirect|Gamma Knife|the album by Kayo Dot|Gamma Knife (album)}}
[[Image:Gamma Knife Graphic.jpg|thumb|[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]] graphic of the Leksell Gamma Knife]]
Gamma knife using Gamma radiation to treat the tumor cells especially in brain.
The Gamma Knife (also known as the Leksell Gamma Knife), a creation of [[Elekta|Elekta AB]], a Swedish public company, is used to treat [[brain tumors]] by administering high-intensity gamma radiation therapy in a manner that concentrates the radiation over a small volume. The device was invented in 1967 at the Karolinska Institute in [[Stockholm]], Sweden by Lars Leksell, Romanian-born neurosurgeon Ladislau Steiner, and [[radiobiologist]] Börje Larsson from [[Uppsala University]], Sweden. The first Gamma Knife was brought to the United States through an arrangement between US neurosurgeon [[Robert Wheeler Rand]] and Leksell and was given to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1979.

A Gamma Knife typically contains 201 [[cobalt-60]] sources of approximately 30&amp;nbsp;[[curie]]s (1.1&amp;nbsp;[[terabecquerel|TBq]]), each placed in a hemispheric array in a heavily [[Radiation protection|shielded]] assembly. The device aims [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] through a target point in the patient's brain.  The patient wears a specialized helmet that is surgically fixed to the skull, so that the brain tumor remains stationary at the target point of the gamma rays. An [[ablation|ablative]] dose of radiation is thereby sent through the tumor in one treatment session, while surrounding brain tissues are relatively spared.

Gamma Knife therapy, like all radiosurgery, uses doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors, delivered precisely to avoid damaging healthy brain tissue. Gamma Knife radiosurgery is able to accurately focus many beams of gamma radiation on one or more tumors. Each individual beam is of relatively low intensity, so the radiation has little effect on intervening brain tissue and is concentrated only at the tumor itself.

Gamma Knife radiosurgery has proven effective for patients with benign or malignant brain tumors up to {{cvt|4|cm|in}} in size, [[Blood vessel|vascular]] malformations such as an [[arteriovenous malformation]] (AVM), pain, and other functional problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Régis J, Bartolomei F, Hayashi M, Chauvel P |title=What role for radiosurgery in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy |journal=Zentralbl.

=== Linear accelerator-based therapies ===
{{main|Megavoltage X-rays}}

A linear accelerator (linac) produces x-rays from the impact of accelerated electrons striking a high ''z'' target (usually tungsten).  A Linac therefore can generate x-rays of any energy, though usually 6&amp;nbsp;MV photons are used.  With a Linac the gantry moves in space to change the delivery angle. Linear accelerator equipment can also move the patient lying on the treatment couch to change the delivery point.  These treatments involve using a stereotactic frame to restrict the patient's movement. The Novalis Shaped Beam Radiosurgery system and Tx Radiosurgery platform, from Brainlab, implement a frameless, non-invasive technique with X-ray imaging that has proven to be both comfortable for the patient and accurate. The Trilogy from Varian, or CyberKnife from Accuray, can also be used with non-invasive immobilization devices coupled with real-time imaging to detect any patient motion during a treatment.

Linear accelerators emit high energy X-rays; the process is usually referred to as "X-ray therapy" or "photon therapy." The term "gamma ray" is usually reserved for photons that are emitted from a radioisotope such as cobalt-60 (see below). Such radiation is not substantially different from that emitted by high voltage accelerators. In linear accelerator therapy, the emission head (called "[[Gantry crane|gantry]]") is mechanically rotated around the patient, in a full or partial circle. The table where the patient is lying, the "couch", can also be moved in small linear or angular steps. The combination of the movements of the gantry and of the couch makes possible the computerized planning of the volume of tissue that is going to be irradiated. Devices with a high energy of 6&amp;nbsp;MeV are the most suitable for the treatment of the brain, due to the depth of the target. The diameter of the energy beam leaving the emission head can be adjusted to the size of the lesion by means of [[collimator]]s. They may be interchangeable orifices with different diameters, typically varying from 5 to 40&amp;nbsp;mm in 5&amp;nbsp;mm steps, or multileaf collimators, which consist of a number of metal leaflets that can be moved dynamically during treatment in order to shape the radiation beam to conform to the mass to be ablated. {{As of|2017}} Linacs are capable of achieving extremely narrow beam geometries, such as 0.15 to 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm. Therefore, they can be used for several kinds of surgeries which hitherto had been carried out by open or endoscopic surgery, such as for trigeminal neuralgia, etc. The exact mechanism of its effectiveness for trigeminal neuralgia is not known; however, its use for this purpose has become very common. Long-term follow-up data has shown it to be as effective as radiofrequency ablation, but inferior to surgery in preventing the recurrence of pain.

A type of linear accelerator therapy which uses a small accelerator mounted on a moving arm to deliver X-rays to a very small area which can be seen on fluoroscopy, is called Cyberknife therapy. Several generations of the frameless robotic Cyberknife system have been developed since its initial inception in 1990. It was invented by [[John R. Adler]], a [[Stanford University]] professor of neurosurgery and radiation oncology, and Russell and Peter Schonberg at Schonberg Research, and is sold by the Accuray company, located in [[Sunnyvale, California]], US. Many such CyberKnife systems are available worldwide.

Cyberknife may be compared to Gamma Knife therapy (see above), but it does not use gamma rays emitted by radioisotopes. It also does not use a frame to hold the patient, as a computer monitors the patient's position during treatment, using [[fluoroscopy]]. The robotic concept of Cyberknife radiosurgery allows the tumor to be tracked, rather than fixing the patient with a stereotaxic frame. Since no frame is needed, some of the radiosurgical concepts can be extended to treat extracranial tumors. In this case, the Cyberknife robotic arm tracks the tumor motion (i.e. respiratory motion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schweikard Achim |author2=Shiomi Hiroya |author3=Adler John | year = 2004 | title = Respiration tracking in radiosurgery | url = | journal = Medical Physics | volume = 31 | issue = 10| pages = 2738–2741 | pmid = 15543778 | doi=10.1118/1.1774132}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A combination of stereo x-ray imaging and infrared tracking sensors determines the tumor position in real time.

=== Proton beam therapy ===
{{main|Proton therapy}}

Protons may also be used in radiosurgery in a procedure called '''Proton Beam Therapy''' (PBT) or [[proton therapy]]. Protons are extracted from proton donor materials by a medical [[synchrotron]] or [[cyclotron]], and accelerated in successive transits through a circular, evacuated conduit or cavity, using powerful magnets to shape their path, until they reach the energy required to just traverse a human body, usually about 200&amp;nbsp;MeV. They are then released toward the region to be treated in the patient's body, the irradiation target. In some machines, which deliver protons of only a specific energy, a custom mask made of plastic is interposed between the beam source and the patient to adjust the beam energy to provide the appropriate degree of penetration. The phenomenon of the [[Bragg peak]] of ejected protons gives proton therapy advantages over other forms of radiation, since most of the proton's energy is deposited within a limited distance, so tissue beyond this range (and to some extent also tissue inside this range) is spared from the effects of radiation. This property of protons, which has been called the "[[depth charge]] effect" by analogy to the explosive weapons used in anti-submarine warfare, allows for conformal dose distributions to be created around even very irregularly shaped targets, and for higher doses to targets surrounded or backstopped by radiation-sensitive structures such as the [[optic chiasm]] or brainstem. The development of "intensity modulated" techniques allowed similar conformities to be attained using linear accelerator radiosurgery.

{{As of|2013}} there was no evidence that proton therapy is better than any other types of treatment in most cases, except for a "handful of rare pediatric cancers". Critics, responding to the increasing number of very expensive PBT installations, spoke of a "medical [[arms race]]"  and "crazy medicine and unsustainable public policy".&lt;ref name="medscape.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/778466 |title=Uncertainty About Proton-Beam Radiotherapy Lingers |website=Medscape|date=30 January 2013  |author=Roxanne Nelson |accessdate= 22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''science slam''' is a scientific talk where scientists present their own [[scientific research]] work in a given time frame - usually 10 minutes - in front of a non-expert audience. The focus lies on teaching current science to a diverse audience in an entertaining way. The presentation is judged by the audience.&lt;ref name="Science in the Pub"&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/wis/fut/bko/en6483164.htm Article on "Science in the Pub"]&lt;/ref&gt; A science slam is a form of [[science communication]].

== Variants ==
Science slams are open to all fields of science. However, events specializing on particular topics exist as well. Examples include: technical science slams,&lt;ref name="ideenexpo science slam"&gt;[http://www.ideenexpo.de/scienceslam/index.php Ideenexpo science slam]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sensus plenior''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase that means "fuller sense" or "fuller meaning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reclaimingthemind.org/wordoftheday/sensus-plenior/|publisher=''reclaimingthemind.org''|date=21 July 2012|accessdate=12 October 2012|title=Sensus plenior|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415161338/http://www.reclaimingthemind.org/wordoftheday/sensus-plenior/|archivedate=15 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/articles/onsite/qna/plenior.html|publisher=''monergism.com''|year=2008 |accessdate=12 October 2012|title=What does the term ''sensus plenior'' mean?}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in Biblical [[exegesis]] to describe the supposed deeper meaning intended by [[God]] but not by the human author. [[Walter C. Kaiser]] notes that the term was coined by F. Andre Fernandez in 1927 but was popularized by [[Raymond E. Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter C. Kaiser, Jr.]], "Single Meaning, Unified Referents: Accurate and Authoritative Citations of the Old Testament by the New Testament," in Kenneth Berding and Jonathan Lunde, ed., ''Three Views on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2007), 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown defines ''sensus plenior'' as
{{quote|That additional, deeper meaning, intended by God but not clearly intended by the human author, which is seen to exist in the words of a biblical text (or group of texts, or even a whole book) when they are studied in the light of further revelation or development in the understanding of revelation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond E. Brown]], ''The ''Sensus Plenior'' of Sacred Scripture'' (Baltimore: St. Mary's University, 1955), 92.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

That implies that more meaning can be found within scripture than the original human authors intended and so the study of scripture that isolates a particular book and concerns itself only with the details of the author's time and situation can be incomplete.

''Sensus plenior'' corresponds to [[pardes (Jewish exegesis)|rabbinical interpretations]] of the [[Hebrew Scriptures]], ''remez'' ("hint"), ''drash'' ("search"), and/or ''sod'' ("secret"), by which deeper meaning is drawn out or  from the text.

[[John Goldingay]] suggests that the citation of [[Isaiah 7:14]] in [[Matthew 1:23]] is a "stock example" of ''sensus plenior''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldingay|first=John|author-link=John Goldingay|title=Approaches to Old Testament Interpretation|year=2002|publisher=Clements Publishing Group|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x0crJtG57M4C&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative Christians have used the term to mean the larger or whole teaching of scripture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7077">'''Sigma heat''', denoted '''&lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;''', is a measure of the [[specific energy]] of humid air.  It is used in the field of [[mining engineering]] for calculations relating to the temperature regulation of mine air. Sigma heat is sometimes called ''total heat'',&lt;ref name="HU glossary"/&gt; although total heat may instead mean [[enthalpy]].&lt;ref name="mm course guide"/&gt;

== Definition ==
Sigma heat is the energy which would be extracted from a unit mass of humid air if it were cooled to a certain reference temperature under [[isobaric process|constant pressure]] while simultaneously removing any [[condensation]] formed during the process. Because sigma heat assumes that condensation will be removed, any energy which would be extracted by cooling the water vapor below its condensation point does not count towards sigma heat.&lt;ref name="SME Handbook"/&gt;   The reference temperature is usually {{convert|0|°F|°C}}, although {{convert|32|°F|°C}} is sometimes used as well.&lt;ref name="HU glossary"/&gt;

Assuming a reference temperature of 0°F, the following formula may be used under standard temperature ranges and pressure:&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Different temperature ranges or pressures will slightly alter the [[heat capacity]] of the water vapor and the air, causing a deviation from the accuracy of this formula.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; S = 0.24 \mathrm{\tfrac{BTU}{lb \cdot ^\circ F}\;} t + W \;( 0.45 \mathrm{\tfrac{BTU}{lb \cdot ^\circ F}\;} t + 1061 \mathrm{\tfrac{BTU}{lb}} ) &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="SME Handbook"/&gt;
:where
:&lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is the sigma heat of the air (in BTU/lb),
:&lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt; is the [[dry-bulb temperature]] of the air (in °F), and
:&lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific humidity]] of the air (unitless).

The equivalent metric formula:

&lt;math&gt; S = 17.86 \mathrm{\tfrac{kJ}{kg}} + 1.005 \mathrm{\tfrac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}} t + W \;( 2501 \mathrm{\tfrac{kJ}{kg}} + 1.884 \mathrm{\tfrac{kJ}{kg \cdot K}} t) &lt;/math&gt;
:where
:&lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is the sigma heat of the air (in kJ/kg),
:&lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt; is the [[dry-bulb temperature]] of the air (in °C), and
:&lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific humidity]] of the air (unitless) sometimes expressed as kg/kg.

== Comparison with enthalpy ==
Sigma heat is not the same as the [[enthalpy]] of the humid air above the reference temperature.  (Enthalpy is sometimes called ''total heat''&lt;ref name="mm course guide"/&gt; or ''true total heat''&lt;ref name="HU glossary"/&gt;)   Unlike sigma heat, enthalpy does include the energy which would be extracted in cooling the condensed water vapor all the way to the reference temperature. Essentially, enthalpy assumes that ''all'' components of the system must be cooled during the cooling process, whereas sigma heat assumes that some of those components (liquid water) are removed part way through the process. Nevertheless, some writers mistakenly use the term enthalpy when they actually mean sigma heat, creating some confusion.&lt;ref name="SME Handbook"/&gt;

Assuming a reference temperature of 0°F, the relationship between enthalpy and sigma heat may be shown mathematically as:

&lt;math&gt; h = S + 1 \mathrm{\tfrac{BTU}{lb}\;} W t' &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="SME Handbook"/&gt;
:where
:&lt;math&gt; h &lt;/math&gt; is the specific enthalpy of the air above its reference temperature,
:&lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is the sigma heat of the air (in BTU/lb),
:&lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific humidity]] of the air (unitless), and
:&lt;math&gt; t' &lt;/math&gt; is the wet bulb temperature (in °F).
:(Standard temperature ranges are assumed.)

== Wet bulb temperature vs. dry bulb temperature ==
Assuming constant pressure, sigma heat is solely a function of the [[wet bulb temperature]] of the air. For this reason, [[humidity]] need not be taken into account unless [[dry-bulb temperature]] measurements are used.  Like sigma heat, the wet bulb temperature is not directly affected by the temperature of any condensed water vapor (liquid water), and it varies only when there is a net energy change to the system.  In contrast, the dry bulb temperature can vary even for processes where there is no such net energy change.  This difference may be understood by examining [[evaporative cooling]].  During evaporative cooling, all energy lost from air molecules as [[sensible heat]] is gained as [[latent heat]] by water molecules evaporating into that air.  With no [[net energy gain]]ed or lost from the now more humid air, sigma heat remains unchanged. In keeping with this, the wet bulb temperature also remains unchanged, as its reading already represented the maximum possible amount of evaporative cooling. The dry bulb temperature however is in conflict with the sigma heat since it decreases during such evaporative cooling. This is why measurements of sigma heat which use dry bulb temperatures must also take into account the humidity of the air.&lt;ref name="SME Handbook"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6088">'''Simon House''' is at 33 Daveys Bay Road, [[Mount Eliza, Victoria|Mount Eliza]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. The house was constructed in the 1960s during the period of architectural experimentation on materiality and structure in houses. Simon House was the first project received on the day when [[Guilford Marsh Bell|Guilford Bell]] and [[Neil Clerehan]] opened their office in South Yarra. The Simons were Clerehan’s partners but the house was a collaboration of partners. Therefore, the house has a mixture of both Clerehan and Bell’s typical style of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of Neil Clerehan|year=2005|publisher=RMIT University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-86459-383-X|pages=15|author=Black R&amp; Edquist H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The house is a single-storey house, planned in a rectangular shape. The house consists of five bedrooms, two toilets, two garages, one kitchen, dining room, living room, pool and terrace. The enclosed pool, natural finishes, glazed wall and an extensive view over the bay recalled contemporary Californian house of architects like [[Craig Ellwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of Neil Clerehan|year=2005|publisher=RMIT University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-86459-383-X|pages=37–41|author=Black R&amp; Edquist H}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Simon house diagram plan.jpg|thumb|design diagram]]

== Design Approach ==
The central core program of the house was a pool and terrace, positioned right in the centre of the house. With the pool and terrace in the centre with programs surrounds &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of Neil Clerehan|year=2005|publisher=RMIT University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-86459-383-X|pages=37–41|author=Black R&amp; Edquist H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
that engaged with it, allows family members to gather together. It was said that was one of Clerehan’s conception of the house where how he deal with the provision of a frame for family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/money/profile-neil-clerehan/2006/08/07/1154802816814.html?page=2 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Profile: Neil Clerehan | date=9 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pool and living room aligned on axis, forming the central part of a symmetrical square plan. Then the programs around the pool were given a corresponding position in the house’s spatial hierarchy. Because of this distinct insistence of having an equivalent position of programs, the programs are mirrored and consist of dual garages and entrances. It was said that was one of Bell’s typical style of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of Neil Clerehan|year=2005|publisher=RMIT University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-86459-383-X|pages=37–41|author=Black R&amp; Edquist H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell has been influenced by the architecture and gardens of Japan. As a countryman, he feels, when in the city, a hunger for the freedom of sky and vegetation. He thinks that a building must stand in spectacular relationship to its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1952-1980 Architecture of Guilford Bell|year=1982|publisher=Proteus Publishing Pty.

It creates a sense of feeling when one is inside, it will feels like outdoors and when one is outside it will feels like indoors. One of his design principal was that he thinks of views or views from the building first, instead of the form of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1952-1980 Architecture of Guilford Bell|year=1982|publisher=Proteus Publishing Pty.

Unfortunately, one of the garage have been renovated into a main entrance, also as a living room. Another garage is built right opposite the existing garage. In this approach, it loses the spatial qualities of the house but in turn allows a convenient use to the owner in the house’s circulation.

'''Source transformation''' is the process of simplifying a circuit solution, especially with mixed sources, by transforming [[voltage]] sources into [[Electric current|current]] sources, and vice versa, using [[Thévenin's theorem]] and [[Norton's theorem]] respectively.

== Process ==

Performing a source transformation consists of using [[Ohm's law]] to take an existing [[voltage source]] in [[series circuit|series]] with a [[resistor|resistance]], and replacing it with a [[current source]] in [[parallel circuit|parallel]] with the same resistance, or vice versa. The transformed sources are considered identical and can be substituted for one another in a circuit.&lt;ref name="Nilsson"&gt;Nilsson, James W., &amp; Riedel, Susan A. (2002). ''Introductory Circuits for Electrical and Computer Engineering''. New Jersey: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

Source transformations are not limited to resistive circuits.  They can be performed on a circuit involving [[capacitors]] and [[inductors]] as well, by expressing circuit elements as impedances and sources in the [[frequency domain]]. In general, the concept of source transformation is an application of [[Thévenin's theorem]] to a [[current source]], or [[Norton's theorem]] to a [[voltage source]]. However, this means that source transformation is bound by the same conditions as Thevenin's theorem and Norton's theorem; namely that the load behaves linearly, and does not contain dependent voltage or current sources.

Source transformations are used to exploit the equivalence of a real current source and a real voltage source, such as a [[battery (electricity)|battery]].  Application of Thévenin's theorem and Norton's theorem gives the quantities associated with the equivalence.  Specifically, given a real current source, which is an ideal current source &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; in [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel]] with an [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, applying a source transformation gives an equivalent real voltage source, which is an ideal voltage source in [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] with the impedance. The impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; retains its value and the new voltage source &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; has value equal to the ideal current source's value times the impedance, according to Ohm's Law &lt;math&gt;V=I*Z&lt;/math&gt;. In the same way, an ideal voltage source in series with an impedance can be transformed into an ideal current source in parallel with the same impedance, where the new ideal current source has value &lt;math&gt; I = V/Z &lt;/math&gt;.

== Example calculation ==
Source transformations are easy to compute using [[Ohm's law]].  If there is a voltage source in [[series circuit|series]] with an [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], it is possible to find the value of the equivalent [[current source]] in [[parallel circuit|parallel]] with the impedance by dividing the value of the voltage source by the value of the impedance.  The converse also holds: if a current source in parallel with an impedance is present, multiplying the value of the current source with the value of the impedance provides the equivalent voltage source in series with the impedance.  A visual example of a source transformation can be seen in Figure 1.

:: &lt;math&gt; V = I\cdot Z,  \qquad  I = \cfrac VZ&lt;/math&gt;


[[Image:Sourcetrans.jpg||frame|left|Figure 1. An example of a DC source transformation.  Notice that the impedance Z is the same in both configurations.]]

{{clear}}

== A brief proof of the theorem ==

The transformation can be derived from the [[electromagnetism uniqueness theorem|uniqueness theorem]]. In the present context, it implies that a black box with two terminals must have a unique well-defined relation between its voltage and current. It is readily to verify that the above transformation indeed gives the same V-I curve, and therefore the transformation is valid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15084">'''Specific absorption rate''' ('''SAR''') is a measure of the rate at which [[energy]] is [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] by the human body when exposed to a [[radio frequency]] (RF) [[electromagnetic field]]. It can also refer to absorption of other forms of energy by tissue, including [[ultrasound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sun |first1= J|last2= Hynynen |first2= K |title=Focusing of therapeutic ultrasound through a human skull: a numerical study |journal=[[J Acoust Soc Am]] |origyear= September 1998 |pmid=9745750 |date=2013-08-12 | bibcode=1998ASAJ..104.1705S| volume=104| pages=1705–15| doi=10.1121/1.424383|issue=3 Pt 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as the [[Power (physics)|power]] absorbed per [[mass]] of [[body tissue|tissue]] and has units of [[watt]]s per [[kilogram]] (W/kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Jianming |last= Jin | title= Electromagnetic Analysis and Design in Magnetic Resonance Imaging | year= 1998 | publisher= CRC Press | isbn= 978-0-8493-9693-9 | pages = §5.3.3 pp. 226ff }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Kshetrimayum|first= Rakhesh Singh|author-link= Rakhesh Singh Kshetrimayum|title= Mobile Phones: Bad for your Health?|journal= IEEE Potentials|volume= 27|issue= 2|url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4475802/?arnumber=4475802 |doi= 10.1109/MPOT.2008.919701|date= March-April 2008|pages= 18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SAR is usually averaged either over the whole body, or over a small sample volume (typically 1&amp;nbsp;g or 10&amp;nbsp;g of tissue). The value cited is then the maximum level measured in the body part studied over the stated volume or mass.

== Calculation ==

SAR for electromagnetic energy can be calculated from the [[electric field]] within the tissue as:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{SAR} = \frac{1}{V}\int_\textrm{sample} \frac{\sigma(\mathbf{r}) |\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})|^2}{\rho(\mathbf{r})} d\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the sample [[electrical conductivity]]
:&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Root mean square|RMS]] electric field
:&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the sample [[density]]
:&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the sample
SAR measures exposure to fields between 100&amp;nbsp;kHz and 10&amp;nbsp;GHz (known as radio waves).&lt;ref name=icnirp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icnirp.org/documents/emfgdl.pdf|title=ICNIRP Guidelines For Limiting Exposure To The Time-Varying Electric, Magnetic And Electromagnetic Fields (Up To 300 GHz)|publisher=[[International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection]]|year=1998|accessdate=2013-12-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606044606/http://www.icnirp.org/documents/emfgdl.pdf|archivedate=2014-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used to measure power absorbed from [[mobile phones]] and during [[MRI]] scans. The value will depend heavily on the geometry of the part of the body that is exposed to the RF energy, and on the exact location and geometry of the RF source. Thus tests must be made with each specific source, such as a mobile phone model, and at the intended position of use.

=== Mobile phone SAR testing ===
{{see also|Mobile phone radiation and health}}
When measuring the SAR due to a mobile phone the phone is placed against a representation of a human head (a "SAR Phantom") in a talk position. The SAR value is then measured at the location that has the highest absorption rate in the entire head, which in the case of a mobile phone is often as close to the phone's antenna as possible. Measurements are made for different positions on both sides of the head and at different frequencies representing the frequency bands at which the device can transmit. Depending on the size and capabilities of the phone, additional testing may also be required to represent usage of the device while placed close to the user's body and/or extremities. Various governments have defined maximum SAR levels for RF energy emitted by mobile devices:

*[[United States]]: the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] requires that phones sold have a SAR level at or below 1.6&amp;nbsp;[[watt]]s per [[kilogram]] (W/kg) taken over the volume containing a mass of 1&amp;nbsp;gram of tissue that is absorbing the most signal.
*[[European Union]]: [[CENELEC]] specify SAR limits within the EU, following [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standards. For mobile phones, and other such hand-held devices, the SAR limit is 2&amp;nbsp;W/kg averaged over the 10&amp;nbsp;g of tissue absorbing the most signal ([http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/033746 IEC 62209-1]).
*[[India]]: switched from the EU limits to the US limits for mobile handsets in 2012. Unlike the US, India will not rely solely on SAR measurements provided by manufacturers; random compliance tests are done by a government-run [[Telecommunication Engineering Center]] (TEC) SAR Laboratory on handsets and 10% of towers. All handsets must have a hands free mode.&lt;ref name=IAreg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=87152 |title=Stringent Mobile Radiation Standards Come into Force from tomorrow New Mobile Handsets to comply with SAR Value of 1.6W/KG - Penalty, Random Checks Introduced for Enforcement |publisher=[[Press Information Bureau]], Government of India |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SAR values are heavily dependent on the size of the averaging volume. Without information about the averaging volume used, comparisons between different measurements cannot be made. Thus, the European 10-gram ratings should be compared among themselves, and the American 1-gram ratings should only be compared among themselves.
To check SAR on your mobile phone, review the documentation provided with the phone, dial *#07# (only works on some models) or visit the manufacturer's website.

=== MRI scanner SAR testing ===
For Magnetic Resonance Imaging the limits (described in [http://webstore.iec.ch/Webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/043851?opendocument IEC 60601-2-33]) are slightly more complicated:

:'''Note''': Averaging time of 6 minutes.
(a) Local SAR is determined over the mass of 10&amp;nbsp;g.

(b) The limit scales dynamically with the ratio "exposed patient mass / patient mass":

NORMAL OPERATING MODE: Partial body SAR = 10&amp;nbsp;W/kg – (8&amp;nbsp;W/kg * exposed patient mass / patient mass)&lt;br&gt;
FIRST LEVEL CONTROLLED OPERATING MODE: Partial body SAR = 10&amp;nbsp;W/kg – (6&amp;nbsp;W/kg * exposed patient mass / patient mass)

(c) In cases where the orbit is in the field of a small local RF transmit coil, care should be taken to ensure that the temperature rise is limited to 1&amp;nbsp;°C.

== Criticism ==

SAR limits set by law do not consider that the human body is particularly sensitive to the power peaks or frequencies responsible for the [[Microwave auditory effect|microwave hearing effect]].&lt;ref name="frey2"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/17/4/689.abstract?sid=7c073ad2-6324-4b47-94e1-124dc0a5f154 | journal=Journal of Applied Physiology| volume=17 |pages=689–692 |year=1962| title=Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy |last=Frey|first= Allan H|accessdate=| pmid=13895081 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frey-headaches"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frey|first= Allan H  |title=Headaches from cellular telephones: are they real and what are the implications? |year=1998 |volume=106 |publisher=[[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] |journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]] |pmc=1533043 |issue=3|doi=10.1289/ehp.98106101|pages=101–103 |pmid=9441959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frey reports that the microwave hearing effect occurs with average power density exposures of 400 μw/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, well below SAR limits (as set by government regulations).&lt;ref name="frey2" /&gt;

Notes:

In comparison to the short term, relatively intensive exposures described above, for long term environmental exposure of the general public there is a limit of 0.08&amp;nbsp;W/kg averaged over the whole body.&lt;ref name=icnirp/&gt; A whole-body average SAR of 0.4&amp;nbsp;W/kg has been chosen as the restriction that provides adequate protection for occupational exposure. An additional safety factor of 5 is introduced for exposure of the public, giving an average whole-body SAR limit of 0.08&amp;nbsp;W/kg.

=== FCC advice ===
The FCC Guide, "Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) For Cell Phones: What It Means For You," after detailing the limitations of SAR values, offers the following "bottom line" editorial:

=== MSBE (minimum SAR with biological effect) ===
In order to find out possible advantages and the interaction mechanisms of Electromagnetic fields (EMF), the minimum SAR (or intensity) that could have biological effect (MSBE) would be much more valuable in comparison to studying high intensity fields. Such studies can possibly shed light on thresholds of non-ionizing radiation effects and cell capabilities (e.g., oxidative response). In addition, it is more likely to reduce the complexity of the EMF interaction targets in cell cultures by lowering the exposure power, which at least reduces the overall rise in temperature. This parameter might differ regarding the case under study and depends on the physical and biological conditions of the exposed target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Sefidbakht|first1= Yahya|last2= Moosavi-Movahedi |first2= Ali Akbar|last3= Hosseinkhani|first3= Saman |last4= Khodagholi|first4= Fariba|last5= Torkzadeh-Mahani|first5= Masoud|last6= Foolad |first6= Forough|last7= Faraji-Dana|first7= Reza|title=Effects of 940 MHz EMF on Bioluminescence and Oxidative Response of Stable Luciferase Producing HEK Cells|journal=Photochemical and Photobiological Sciences |date=April 2014|volume=13|issue=7|page=1082|doi=10.1039/C3PP50451D|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/PP/2014/c3pp50451d#!divAbstract|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_\nu\propto\nu^\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that if flux does not follow a [[power law]] in frequency, the spectral index itself is a function of frequency. Rearranging the above, we see that the spectral index is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \! \left( \nu \right) = \frac{\partial \log S_\nu \! \left( \nu \right)}{\partial \log \nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly the power law can only apply over a certain range of frequency because otherwise the integral over all frequencies would be infinite.

Spectral index is also sometimes defined in terms of [[wavelength]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the spectral index &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is given implicitly by
:&lt;math&gt;S_\lambda\propto\lambda^\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;
and at a given frequency, spectral index may be calculated by taking the derivative
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \! \left( \lambda \right) =\frac{\partial \log S_\lambda \! \left( \lambda \right)}{\partial \log \lambda}.&lt;/math&gt;
The spectral index using the &lt;math&gt;S_\nu&lt;/math&gt;, which we may call &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\nu,&lt;/math&gt; differs from the index &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; defined using &lt;math&gt;S_\lambda.&lt;/math&gt; The total flux between two frequencies or wavelengths is
:&lt;math&gt;S=C_1(\nu_2^{\alpha_\nu+1}-\nu_1^{\alpha_\nu+1})=C_2(\lambda_2^{\alpha_\lambda+1}-\lambda_1^{\alpha_\lambda+1})=c^{\alpha_\lambda+1}C_2(\nu_2^{-\alpha_\lambda-1}-\nu_1^{-\alpha_\lambda-1})&lt;/math&gt;
which implies that
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_\lambda=-\alpha_\nu-2.&lt;/math&gt;
The opposite sign convention is sometimes employed,&lt;ref&gt;Burke, B.F., Graham-Smith, F. (2009). ''An Introduction to Radio Astronomy, 3rd Ed.'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-87808-1}}, page 132.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the spectral index is given by
:&lt;math&gt;S_\nu\propto\nu^{-\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

The spectral index of a source can hint at its properties. For example, using the positive sign convention, a spectral index of 0 to 2 at radio frequencies indicates [[thermal emission]], while a steep negative spectral index typically indicates [[synchrotron emission]].

==Spectral Index of Thermal emission==
At radio frequencies (i.e. in the low-frequency, long-wavelength limit), where the [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]] is a good approximation to the spectrum of [[thermal radiation]], intensity is given by
:&lt;math&gt;B_\nu(T) \simeq \frac{2 \nu^2 k T}{c^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the logarithm of each side and taking the partial derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;\log \, \nu&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \log B_\nu(T)}{\partial \log \nu} \simeq 2.&lt;/math&gt;
Using the positive sign convention, the spectral index of thermal radiation is thus &lt;math&gt;\alpha \simeq 2&lt;/math&gt; in the Rayleigh-Jeans regime. The spectral index departs from this value at shorter wavelengths, for which the Rayleigh-Jeans law becomes an increasingly inaccurate approximation, tending towards zero as intensity reaches a peak at a frequency given by [[Wien's_displacement_law#Frequency-dependent_formulation|Wien's displacement law]]. Because of the simple temperature-dependence of radiative flux in the Rayleigh-Jeans regime, the ''radio spectral index'' is defined implicitly by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Spectral Index |publisher=[[Wolfram Research]] |url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/RadioSpectralIndex.html  |accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S \propto \nu^{\alpha} T.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''technology acceptance model''' ('''TAM''') is an [[information systems]] theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology. The model suggests that when users are presented with a new technology, a number of factors influence their decision about how and when they will use it, notably:
* '''Perceived usefulness''' (PU) – This was defined by Fred Davis as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her [[job performance]]".
* '''Perceived ease-of-use''' (PEOU) – Davis defined this as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort" ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}).
The TAM has been continuously studied and expanded—the two major upgrades being the TAM 2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}} &amp; {{harvnb|Venkatesh|2000}}) and the [[Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology]] (or [[UTAUT]], {{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). A TAM 3 has also been proposed in the context of [[e-commerce]] with an inclusion of the effects of trust and perceived risk on system use ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Bala|2008}}).

==History==

TAM is one of the most influential extensions of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA) in the literature. Davis's technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, &amp; Warshaw, 1989)
is the most widely applied model of users' acceptance and usage of technology
(Venkatesh, 2000). It was developed by Fred Davis and [[Richard Bagozzi]] ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}, {{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muhammad Sharif Abbasi|last2=Ali Tarhini|last3=Tariq Elyas|last4=Farwa Shah|date=2015-10-09|title=Impact of individualism and collectivism over the individual's technology acceptance behaviour: A multi-group analysis between Pakistan and Turkey|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=28|issue=6|pages=747–768|doi=10.1108/JEIM-12-2014-0124|issn=1741-0398}}&lt;/ref&gt;). TAM replaces many of TRA's attitude measures with the two technology acceptance measures&amp;mdash;''ease of use'', and ''usefulness''. TRA and TAM, both of which have strong behavioural elements, assume that when someone forms an intention to act, that they will be free to act without limitation. In the real world there will be many constraints, such as limited freedom to act ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}).

Bagozzi, Davis and Warshaw say:

:''Because new technologies such as personal computers are complex and an element of uncertainty exists in the minds of decision makers with respect to the successful adoption of them, people form attitudes and intentions toward trying to learn to use the new technology prior to initiating efforts directed at using. Attitudes towards usage and intentions to use may be ill-formed or lacking in conviction or else may occur only after preliminary strivings to learn to use the technology evolve. Thus, actual usage may not be a direct or immediate consequence of such attitudes and intentions.'' ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}})

Earlier research on the [[diffusion of innovations]] also suggested a prominent role for perceived ease of use. Tornatzky and Klein ({{harvnb|Tornatzky|Klein|1982}}) analysed the adoption, finding that compatibility, relative advantage, and complexity had the most significant relationships with adoption across a broad range of innovation types. Eason studied perceived usefulness in terms of a fit between systems, tasks and job profiles, using the terms "task fit" to describe the metric (quoted in {{harvnb|Stewart|1986}})  {{harvnb|Legris|Ingham|Collerette|2003}} suggest that TAM must be extended to include variables that account for change processes and that this could be achieved through adoption of the innovation model into TAM.

==Usage==
Several researchers have replicated Davis's original study ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to provide empirical evidence on the relationships that exist between usefulness, ease of use and system use ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}; {{harvnb|Davis|1989}}; {{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}; {{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}; {{harvnb|Subramanian|1994}}; {{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}). Much attention has focused on testing the robustness and validity of the questionnaire instrument used by Davis. Adams et al. ({{harvnb|Adams|1992}}) replicated the work of Davis ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to demonstrate the validity and reliability of his instrument and his measurement scales. They also extended it to different settings and, using two different samples, they demonstrated the internal consistency and replication reliability of the two scales. Hendrickson et al. ({{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}) found high reliability and good test-retest reliability. Szajna ({{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}) found that the instrument had predictive validity for intent to use, self-reported usage and attitude toward use. The sum of this research has confirmed the validity of the Davis instrument, and to support its use with different populations of users and different software choices.

Segars and Grover ({{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}) re-examined Adams et al.'s ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}) replication of the Davis work. They were critical of the measurement model used, and postulated a different model based on three constructs: usefulness, effectiveness, and ease-of-use. These findings do not yet seem to have been replicated. However, some aspects of these findings were tested and supported by Workman ({{harvnb|Workman|2007}}) by separating the dependent variable into information use versus technology use.

Mark Keil and his colleagues have developed (or, perhaps rendered more popularisable) Davis's model into what they call the Usefulness/[[EOU Grid]], which is a 2×2 grid where each quadrant represents a different combination of the two attributes. In the context of software use, this provides a mechanism for discussing the current mix of usefulness and EOU for particular software packages, and for plotting a different course if a different mix is desired, such as the introduction of even more powerful software ({{harvnb|Keil|Beranek|Konsynski|1995}}).
The TAM model has been used in most technological and geographic contexts. One of these contexts is health care, which is growing rapidly &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rahimi |first1=Bahlol |first2=Hamed |last2=Nadri |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Toomas|last4=Timpka|title=A Systematic Review of the Technology Acceptance Model in Health Informatics|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=3|pages=604–634 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1668091 |pmid=30112741|pmc=6094026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


Venkatesh and Davis extended the original TAM model to explain perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence (subjective norms, voluntariness, image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, perceived ease of use). The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested in both voluntary and mandatory settings. The results strongly supported TAM2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).

In an attempt to integrate the main competing user acceptance models, Venkatesh et al. formulated the [[unified theory of acceptance and use of technology]] (UTAUT). This model was found to outperform each of the individual models (Adjusted R square of 69 percent) ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). UTAUT has been adopted by some recent studies in healthcare.&lt;ref name=hf2010&gt;{{Cite journal

==Alternative models==
# The '''MPT model''': Independent of TAM, Scherer ({{harvnb|Scherer|1986}}) developed the [[matching person and technology model]] in 1986 as part of her National Science Foundation-funded dissertation research. The MPT model is fully described in her 1993 text ({{harvnb|Scherer|2005}}, 1st ed. 1993), "Living in the State of Stuck", now in its 4th edition. The MPT model has accompanying assessment measures used in technology selection and decision-making, as well as outcomes research on differences among technology users, non-users, avoiders, and reluctant users.
# The [[HMSAM]]: TAM has been effective for explaining many kinds of systems use (i.e. [[e-learning]], [[learning management system]]s, [[webportal]]s, etc.) (Fathema, Sutton, 2013, Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). However, TAM is not ideally suited to explain adoption of purely intrinsic or hedonic systems (e.g., online games, music, learning for pleasure). Thus, an alternative model to TAM, called the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) was proposed for these kinds of systems by Lowry et al. ({{harvnb|Lowry|Gaskin|Twyman|Hammer|Roberts|2013}}). HMSAM is designed to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, only pornography, gamified systems, and for general [[gamification]]. Instead of a minor TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based cognitive absorption (CA). HMSAM may be especially useful in understanding gamification elements of systems use.
# '''Extended TAM''': Several studies proposed extension of original TAM (Davis, 1989) by adding external variables in it with an aim of exploring the effects of external factors on users' attitude, behavioral intention and actual use of technology. Several factors have been examined  so far. For example, perceived self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, and systems quality  (Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). This model has also been applied in the acceptance of health care technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nadri |first1=Hamed |first2=Bahlol |last2=Rahimi |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Mahnaz|last4=Samadbeik|last5 =Garavand|first5 =Ali|title=Factors Affecting Acceptance of Hospital Information Systems Based on Extended Technology Acceptance Model: A Case Study in Three Paraclinical Departments
|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=2|pages=238–247 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1641595 |pmid=29618139|pmc=5884692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
TAM has been widely criticised, despite its frequent use, leading the original proposers to attempt to redefine it several times. Criticisms of TAM as a "theory" include its questionable heuristic value, limited explanatory and predictive power, triviality, and lack of any practical value ({{harvnb|Chuttur|2009}}). [[Izak Benbasat|Benbasat]] and [[Henri Barki|Barki]] suggest that TAM "has diverted researchers' attention away from other 
important research issues and has created an illusion of progress in knowledge accumulation. Furthermore, the 
independent attempts by several researchers to expand TAM in order to adapt it to the constantly changing IT environments has lead{{sic}} to a state of theoretical chaos and confusion" ({{harvnb|Benbasat|Barki|2007}}). In general, TAM focuses on the individual  'user' of a computer, with the concept of 'perceived usefulness', with extension to bring in more and more factors to explain how a user 'perceives' 'usefulness', and ignores the essentially social processes of IS development and implementation, without question where more technology is actually better, and the social consequences of IS use. Lunceford argues that the framework of perceived usefulness and ease of use overlooks other issues, such as cost and structural imperatives that force users into adopting the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lunceford|first=Brett|date=2009|title=Reconsidering Technology Adoption and Resistance: Observations of a Semi-Luddite|url=https://www.academia.edu/510375|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=29–47|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a recent analysis and critique of TAM, see Bagozzi ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|2007}}).

Legris et al.&lt;ref&gt;Legris et al. 2003, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that, together, TAM and TAM2 account for only 40% of a technological system's use.

Perceived ease of use is less likely to be a determinant of attitude and usage intention according to studies of telemedicine ({{harvnb|Hu|Chau|Sheng|Tam|1999}}), mobile commerce ({{harvnb|Wu|Wang|2005}}, and online banking ({{harvnb|Pikkarainen|2004}}).

A study conducted by Okafor, D. J., Nico, M. &amp; Azman, B. B. (2016) discovered that perceived ease of use doesn't have any influence on the adoption of multimedia online technologies for Malaysian SMEs. The answers from the participants in this study suggest that, for them, perceived ease of use was not indicative of their behavioural intention to adopt multimedia online technologies (MOT) in the future. Instead of not adopting MOT, if they are complicated some participants said they are willing to learn it or practice more.

'''Villa rustica''' ('''countryside villa''') was the term used by the ancient Romans to denote a villa set in the open countryside, often as the hub of a large agricultural estate (''[[Latifundia|latifundium]]''). The adjective ''rusticum'' was used to distinguish it from an urban or resort [[Roman villa|villa]]. The ''villa rustica'' would thus serve both as a residence of the landowner and his family (and retainers) and also as a farm management centre. It would often comprise separate buildings to accommodate farm labourers and sheds and barns for animals and crops.&lt;ref&gt;Annalia Marzano: ''Roman villas in central Italy: a social and economic history''.

In modern British [[archaeology]], a ''villa rustica'' is commonly (and misleadingly) referred to simply as a "Roman villa".

The villa rustica's design differed depending on the architect, but usually it consisted of three parts; the urbana (main house), agricultural center and the rusticana (farm area).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33376">'''Wildlife observation''' is the practice of noting the occurrence or abundance of a dead or living animal [[species]] at a specific location and time.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, D. E. and R. L. Winstead, 1980. Estimating the numbers of wildlife populations. Pp. 221-247. In S.D. Schemnitz (editor). Wildlife Management and Techniques Manual. The Wildlife Society,Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of scientific wildlife observation includes the reporting of what ([[diagnosis]] of the species), where ([[geographical location]]), when (date and time), who (details about observer), and why (reason for observation, or explanations for occurrence). Wildlife observation can be performed if the animals are alive, with the most notable example being face-to-face observation and live cameras, or are dead, with the primary example being the notifying of where roadkill has occurred. This outlines the basic information needed to collect data for a wildlife observation; which can also contribute to scientific investigations of distribution, habitat relations, trends, and movement of wildlife species. One example of this type of activity is [[birdwatching|bird watching.]] Wildlife observation allows for the study of organisms with minimal disturbance to their ecosystem depending on the type of method or equipment used. The use of equipment such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), more commonly known as drones, may disturb and cause negative impacts on wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodgson|first=Jarrod C.|last2=Koh|first2=Lian Pin|date=2016-05-23|title=Best practice for minimising unmanned aerial vehicle disturbance to wildlife in biological field research|journal=Current Biology|volume=26|issue=10|pages=R404–405|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2016.04.001|issn=1879-0445|pmid=27218843}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized equipment can be used to collect more accurate data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/policy/605fw4.html|title=605 FW 4, Wildlife Observation, Fish and Wildlife Service Manual, U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service|website=www.fws.gov|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
Through wildlife observation, there are many important details that can be discovered about the environment. For instance, if a fisher in Taiwan discovers that a certain species of fish he/she frequently catches is becoming rarer and rarer, there might be a substantial issue in the water that fisher is fishing in. It could be that there is a new predator in the water that has changed the [http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/food-chain/ animal food chain], a source of pollution, or perhaps even a larger problem. Regardless of the reason, this process of observing animals can help identify potential issues before they become severe problems in the world.

Additionally, through animal observation, those who participate are also actively participating in the conservation of animal life. Oftentimes, the two subjects go hand-in-hand with one another because through the observation of animals, individuals are also discovering what issues animals around the world are currently facing and if there are any ways to put up a fight against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalwildlife.org|title=Global Wildlife Conservation|website=globalwildlife.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more observation, fewer species of animals will become extinct.

==Research==
Before one can get started observing wildlife and helping the environment, it is important to research the animal they are choosing to observe. If one simply went into the observation process and skipped the crucial process of obtaining knowledge about the animals, it would be difficult for them to determine if anything was out of the ordinary.&lt;ref name="How to Watch Wildlife"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Watch-Wildlife|title=How to Watch Wildlife|newspaper=wikiHow|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before observing, it would be wise to find out simple information about the animal such as:
* What the animal eats - Is the animal a carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore?
* What animals prey on the animal?
* Where does the animal live?
* Is the animal dangerous?
* Is it endangered?
* Does the animal travel in packs or alone?
* What are the animal's sleeping habits? &lt;ref name="How to Watch Wildlife"/&gt;

==Projects and programs devoted to wildlife observation==

===Projects===
There are a variety of projects and websites devoted to wildlife observations. One of the most common projects are for bird observations (for example: [http://ebird.org e-bird]). For those who enjoy bird watching, there are a variety of ways one can contribute to this type of wildlife observation. The National Wildlife Refuge System has volunteer opportunities, citizen science projects, and if one is limiting in time; could purchase a Federal Duck Stamp that donates money to the wildlife refuge lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/refuges/birding/getinvolved.html|title=Get Involved {{!}} National Wildlife Refuge System|last=System|first=National Wildlife Refuge|website=www.fws.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past few years, websites dedicated to reporting wildlife across broad taxonomic ranges have become available. For example, the [http://www.wildlifecrossing.net/california California Roadkill Observation System] provides a mechanism for citizen-scientists in California to report wildlife species killed by vehicles. The [http://www.wildlifecrossing.net/maine Maine Audubon Wildlife Road Watch] allows reporting of observations of both dead and live animals along roads. A more recent addition to wildlife observation tools are the web sites that facilitate uploading and management of images from remote wildlife cameras. For example, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] supports the [http://eMammal.wordpress.com eMammal] and [http://siwild.si.edu Smithsonian Wild] programs, which provide a mechanism for volunteer deployment of wildlife cameras around the world.  Similarly, the [http://wildlifeobserver.net Wildlife Observer Network] hosts over a dozen wildlife-camera projects from around the world, providing tools and a database to manage photographs and camera networks.

===Monitoring programs===
Monitoring programs for wildlife utilize new and easier ways to monitor animal species for citizen scientists and research scientists alike. One such monitoring device is the automated recorder. Automated recorders are a reliable way to monitor species such as bird, bats, and amphibians as they provide ability to save and independently identify a specific animal call.&lt;ref name="Furnas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furnas|first1=Brett J.|title=Using Automated Recorders and Occupancy Models to Monitor Common Forest Birds Across a Large Geographic Region|journal=Journal of Wildlife Management|date=February 2015|volume= 79|pages=pp.&amp;nbsp;325–337.|doi=10.1002/jwmg.821}}&lt;/ref&gt; The automated recorder analyzes the sounds of the species to identify the species and how many there are.&lt;ref name="Furnas" /&gt; It was found that using the automated recorders produced larger quantity and even more quality data when compared with traditional, point-count data recording.&lt;ref name="Acevedo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Acevedo|first1=Miguel A.and |last2=Villanueva-Rivera|first2=Luis J.|title=Using Automated Digital Recording Systems as Effective Tools for the Monitoring of Birds and Amphibians|journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin|date=2006|volume= 34 | issue = 1 |pages=pp.&amp;nbsp;211–214. |doi=10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[211:uadrsa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While providing better quality, it also provides a permanent record of the census which can be continually reviewed for any potential bias.&lt;ref name="Acevedo" /&gt; This monitoring device can improve wildlife observation and potentially save more animals. Using this device can allow for continued tracking of populations, continued censusing of individuals within a species, and allow for faster population size estimates.&lt;ref name="Furnas" /&gt;

==Live watching and observation==

===Birdwatching===
One of the most popular forms of wildlife observation, [[birdwatching]], is typically performed as a recreational pleasure. Those looking to birdwatch typically travel into a forest or other wooded area with a pair of binoculars in hand to aid the process. Birdwatching has become all the more important with the amount of deforestation that has been occurring in the world. Birds are arguably the most important factor in the balance of environmental [[system]]s: "They pollinate plants, disperse seeds, scavenge carcasses and recycle nutrients back into the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.audubon.org/magazine/march-april-2013/why-do-birds-matter|title=Why Do Birds Matter?|date=2013-03-06|newspaper=Audubon|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decrease in the total number of birds would cause destruction to much of the environmental system. The plants and trees around the world would die at an alarming rate which would, in turn, set off a chain reaction that would cause many other animals to die due to the environment change and [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]]. 
[[File:Birdwatching on beach.jpg|thumb|244x244px|Birdwatchers on a beach]]

One of the ways that birdwatching has an effect on the environment as a whole is that through consistent birdwatching, an observer would be able to identify whether they are seeing less of a certain species of bird. If this happens, there typically is a reasons for the occurrence, whether it be because of an increase in pollution in the area or possibly an increase in the population of predators.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://birding.about.com/od/birdconservation/a/importconserve.htm|title=bird wildlife conservation protect protection conserve environment|newspaper=About.com Home|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a watcher were to take notice of a change in what they typically see, they could notify the city or park and allow them to investigate into the cause a bit further. Through this action, birdwatchers are preserving the future for both animal and human life.

Subsequently, by taking children birdwatching it is allowing the future generation to understand the importance of animal observation. If children learn at a young age how the environmental system works and that all life is intertwined, the world will be in much better hands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These children will be the ones pioneer conservation movements and attempt to protect the habit for all animals.

===Livestreams===
Live streams of animal exhibits at various zoos and aquariums across the United States have also become extremely popular. The [[Tennessee Aquarium]] has a webcam that allows online viewers to take a look into the happening so their Secret Reef exhibit which consists of reef fish, sharks, and a rescued green sea turtle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tnaqua.org/animals-exhibits/secret-reef-cam/|title=Secret Reef Cam {{!}} Tennessee Aquarium|last=Aquarium|first=Tennessee|website=www.tnaqua.org|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most popular animals cams in the United States though come from, naturally, the largest zoo in the United States: [[San Diego Zoo|The San Diego Zoo]]. The San Diego Zoo features eight live cams on their website – A panda, elephant, ape, penguin, polar bear, tiger, condor, and koala. The purpose of the live streams is to help educate the public about the behaviors of several different animals and to entertain those who might not be able to travel to a zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/content/video-more|title=Video &amp; More|date=2013-12-03|newspaper=San Diego Zoo|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other notable zoos that have webcams are the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]], [[Woodland Park Zoo]], [[Houston Zoo]], and [[Zoo Atlanta|Atlanta Zoo]].

Additionally, the [[National Museum of Natural History|Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]] has opened a butterfly and plant observation pavilion. Visitors walk into a large tent and experience a one-of-a-kind situation in which hundreds of rare butterflies from all across the world are inches from their faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://naturalhistory.si.edu/butterflies/|title=Butterflies + Plants: Partners in Evolution, Home Page|website=naturalhistory.si.edu|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collecting data===
As is the case with a majority of subjects, one of the best and most effective ways to observe live animals is through data collection. This process can be done through a livestream or in the wild but it is more useful if the data is collected on animals that are in currently in the wild.&lt;ref name="study.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/how-to-observe-measure-describe-animal-behavior.html|title=How to Observe, Measure &amp; Describe Animal Behavior {{!}} Study.com|newspaper=Study.com|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ways the data can be collected are endless and it really just depends on what purpose an individual has as to what data would be the most useful.

For example, if someone is interested in how deer interact with other animals in a certain location, it would be beneficial for them to take notes and record all of the animals that are native to the area where the deer are located. From there, they can describe any scenarios in which the deer had a positive or negative interaction with the other species of animals. In this instance, it would not really be helpful for the observer to collect data pertaining to the types of food the deer eat because the study is only focusing on the interaction amongst animals.

Another example of how collecting data on wildlife would be useful is keeping track of the total number of a certain species exists within a forest. Naturally, it will be impossible to get a definitive number but if an accurate approximation can be made, it could be beneficial in determining if there has been a random increase or decrease in the population. If there is an increase, it could be due to a change in the species migration habits and if there is a decrease, it could be due to an external factor such as pollution or introduction of a new predator.&lt;ref name="study.com"/&gt;

==Deceased wildlife observation==
[[File:Wildlife crossing.jpg|thumb|244x244px|An example of a wildlife crossing sign]]

===Online systems and mobile apps===
Many states have already begun to set up websites and systems for the public. The main purpose behind the movement is so that they can notify other individuals about [[Roadkill|road-killed]] wildlife. If enough people fill out the forms located on the websites, the government will become notified that there have been occurrences of a loss of animal life and will take the steps required to prevent it. Typically, the step that is taken is the posting of a wildlife crossing sign that, in turn, allows the public to know where there are common animal crossings. Maine and California are the states that have been the pioneers of this movement and this process has become particularly important on heavily traveled roads as no one would like endanger the animals or themselves.&lt;ref name="wildlifecrossing.net|title=wildlifecrossing.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wildlifecrossing.net|title=wildlifecrossing.net {{!}} wildlife observation reporting|website=www.wildlifecrossing.net|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there is an app (available on both iPhone and Android devices) made specifically for the purpose of identifying road-kill called [https://www.herpmapper.org/mobile/mapper “Mobile Mapper.”] The app is a partner of the HerpMapper website. The purpose of the website is to use the user recorded observations for research and conservation purposes.&lt;ref name="wildlifecrossing.net|title=wildlifecrossing.net"/&gt;

On average, the cost of repairing a car that has been damaged by a deer or other medium to large-sized animal is $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hcn.org/issues/291/15268|title=Roadkill statistics|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though there is no way that accidents involving animals can completely be prevented, placing more signs about possible animal crossings zones would cause drivers to drive more carefully and therefore have fewer accidents. Economically, this means that more families will be saving money and it could be used in a different way to help contributed to society as a whole.

==Issues leading to the extinction of animals==

===Climate change===
[[Climate change]] is one of the most heavily discussed topics around the world today, both politically and scientifically. The climate that Earth is currently experiencing has been steadily changing over time due to both natural causes and human exploitation.&lt;ref name="Media"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climateandweather.net/global-warming/climate-change-and-animals.html|title=Climate change - effects on animals|last=Media|first=Ali Penman {{!}} Web Smart|website=www.climateandweather.net|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change has the potential to be detrimental to wildlife across the world, whether that be through rising sea levels, changes in temperatures through the years, or [[deforestation]].&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt; These are just a few of the examples of the contributing factors to climate change.

Climate change is not something that citizens can entirely prevent from happening even if they wanted to. There are many natural causes such as [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] and the Earth's orbit around the sun that are strong contributing factors to the phenomena.&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climatechange.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=65CD73F4-1|title=climatechange.gc.ca - Facts on Climate Change - Causes of Climate Change|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Environment and Climate Change|website=www.climatechange.gc.ca|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, prevention measures that can be taken to prevent climate change from happening as quickly. The primary way to prevent climate change is for society to reduce the amount of [[greenhouse gas]]es that are present in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt; This can be done through the improving of energy efficiency in many buildings, the stoppage of deforestation so more carbon dioxide can be removed from the atmosphere, and mode switching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cehtp.org/faq/climate_change/preventing_and_preparing_for_climate_change|title=Climate Change|website=cehtp.org|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rising sea levels====
One of the more notable effects climate change has on the environment is the rising of sea levels around the world. Over the past 100 years, the sea level has risen approximately 1.8 millimeters each year.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.actforlibraries.org/the-impact-of-rising-sea-levels-on-animal-life/|title=The Impact of Rising Sea Levels on Animal Life {{!}} Actforlibraries.org|website=www.actforlibraries.org|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steady rise in sea levels can be attributed to the steadily increasing temperatures the Earth faces each year which causes the ice caps and glaciers to melt.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt; This increase in sea level is detrimental to the [[Coast|coastal ecosystems]] that exist around the world.
[[File:Polar bear after unlucky hunt for a seal.jpg|thumb|Polar bear hunting for food]]
The increase in sea level causes flooding on coastal wetlands, where certain animals will be unable to survive due to [http://eden.cce.cornell.edu/disasters/Documents/PDFs/saltwater%20innundation%20fact%20sheet.pdf saltwater inundation].&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt; The increase in the total amount of saltwater present in these wetlands could prove to be problematic for many species. While some may simply have to migrate to other areas, smaller ecosystems within the wetlands could be destroyed which, once again, influences the animal food chain.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt;

[[Polar bear]]s are animals that are specifically affected through the process of rising sea levels. Living near the Arctic region, polar bears find their food on ice caps and sheets of ice. As these sheets continue to become fewer in quantity, it is predicted that the polar bears will have a difficult time sustaining life and that by the year 2050, there could be less than 20,000 on Earth.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt;

[[Coral reef]]s are the primary ecosystem that would be affected through a continuing increase in the sea level:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The coral reef ecosystem is adapted to thrive within certain temperature and sea level range. Corals live in a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic [[zooxanthellae]]. Zooxanthellae need the sunlight in order to produce the nutrients necessary for the coral. Sea level rise may cause a decrease in solar radiation at the sea surface level, affecting the ability of photosynthetic zooxanthellae to produce nutrients for the coral, whereas, a sudden exposure of the coral reef to the atmosphere due to a low tide event may induce coral bleaching."&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Coral reefs with fishes.JPG|thumb|Coral reef with fish]]
The loss of coral would have a subsequent effect on the total number of fish that exist within these ecosystems. In the Indo-Pacific coral reefs alone, there are in-between 4000 and 5000 different species of fish that have a relationship with the species of coral.&lt;ref name="eatlas.org.au"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eatlas.org.au/content/relationship-between-corals-and-fishes-great-barrier-reef|title=Relationship between corals and fishes on the Great Barrier Reef {{!}} eAtlas|website=eatlas.org.au|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the numerous different species of [[Butterflyfish|butterfly fish]] that feed on coral within these reefs would be affected if the coral was unable to live due to an increase in sea level.&lt;ref name="eatlas.org.au"/&gt; Referring back to the food chain topic, this would then subsequently but directly affect species of snappers, eels, and sharks that use butterfly fish as a primary source of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://a-z-animals.com/animals/butterfly-fish/|title=Butterfly Fish (Chaetodontidae) - Animals - A-Z Animals - Animal Facts, Information, Pictures, Videos, Resources and Links|last=A-Z-Animals.com|website=a-z-animals.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the snappers cannot find any butterfly fish to eat because the butterfly fish are dying due to the lack of coral, it means that the snapper population will decrease as well.

The rising of sea level has the possibility to be catastrophic to the coastal ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-coastal-areas|title=Climate Impacts on Coastal Areas|last=EPA,OA|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution===
[[Pollution]] is another crucial threat to animal life, and human life, across the world. Every form of pollution has an effect on wildlife, whether it be through the air, water, or ground. While sometimes the origin and form of pollution is visible and easy to determine, other times it can be a mystery as to what exactly is causing the death of animals. Through constant and consistent observation of habitat analysis, humans can help prevent the loss of animal life by recognizing the early signs of pollution before the problem becomes too large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/pollution|title=Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ocean and water pollution====
[[File:Deepwater Horizon oil spill fishing closure map 2010-06-02.png|thumb|Map of the area where fishing was affected because of the BP oil spill]]
Pollution can enter bodies of water in many different ways - Through toxic runoff from pesticides and fertilizers, containers of oil and other hazardous materials falling off of ships, or just from debris  from humans that has not been picked up.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/pollution|title=Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; No matter what the form of pollution is, the effects water pollution has on animal life can be drastic. For example, the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|BP oil spill]] which occurred in 2010 impacted over 82,000 birds, 6,000 sea turtles, approximately 26,000 marine animals, and hundreds of thousands of fish.&lt;ref name="A Deadly Toll"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/public_lands/energy/dirty_energy_development/oil_and_gas/gulf_oil_spill/a_deadly_toll.html|title=A Deadly Toll|website=www.biologicaldiversity.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the observation of how animal life was and has been affected by this spill is unique and definitely on the larger scale, it still represents an accurate depiction of how observation can be crucial to animal lives. For example, by observing that a certain species of sea turtle was affected by the oil spill, zoologists and their teams would be able to determine the effects the loss of that sea turtle would have.&lt;ref name="A Deadly Toll"/&gt;

Another prominent example is how if one day a fisherman goes to a lake that he/she frequently visits and notices two or three dead fish on the surface. Knowing that that frequently does not happen, the fisherman tells his local city officials and park rangers about the occurrence and they find out that a farmer has been using a new pesticide that runs off into the lake. By simply observing what is common and what is not, the effects of some water pollution can be stopped before becoming too severe.

====Air pollution====
[[File:Pollution de l'air.jpg|thumb|Smoke coming from a factory]]
Air pollution is commonly associated with the image of billowing clouds of smoke rising into the sky from a large factory. While the fumes and smoke previously stated definitely is a prominent form of air pollution, it is not the only one. Air pollution can come from the emission of cars, smoking, and other sources.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"/&gt; Air pollution does not just affect birds though, like one may have thought. Air pollution affects mammals, birds, reptiles, and any other organism that requires oxygen to live.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"/&gt; Frequently, if there is any highly dangerous air pollution, the animal observation process will be rather simple: There will be an abundance of dead animals located near the vicinity of the pollution.

The primary concern of air pollution is how widespread the pollution can become in a short period of time. [[Acid rain]] is one of the largest forms of pollution today. The issue with acid rain is that it affects literally every living organism it comes in contact with, whether that be trees in a forest, water in an ocean or lake, or the skin of humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climateandweather.net/world-weather/acid-rain.html|title=Acid Rain|last=Media|first=Ali Penman {{!}} Web Smart|website=www.climateandweather.net|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that are emitted from factories.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"/&gt; If it is not controlled in a timely manner, it could lead to loss of life due to the dangerous nature of the composition of the rain.

===Deforestation===
Deforestation has become one of the most prevalent issues environmentally. With an continuously growing population and not having the space to contain all the humans on Earth, forests are frequently the first areas that are cleared to make more room.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/deforestation-overview/|title=Deforestation Facts, Deforestation Information, Effects of Deforestation - National Geographic|last=Society|first=National Geographic|newspaper=National Geographic|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to National Geographic, forests still cover approximately 30 percent of the land on Earth but each year large portions are cleared.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

With deforestation, there are numerous subsequent side effects. Most notably, the clearing of entire forests (in some instances) destroys the habitat for hundreds of species of animals and 70 percent of the animals that reside in the forest will die as a result.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; Additionally, deforestation causes a reduction in the total [[Canopy (biology)|canopy cover]] which leads to more extreme temperature swings on the ground level because there are no branches and leaves to catch the sun's rays.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

The way to combat the severe effects on the loss of animal life would be to stop cutting trees and forests down. While this is unlikely and almost impossible to happen, there is another solution: the partial removal of forests. By only removing portions of the forest, it keeps the environment of the entire forest in tact which allows the animals to adapt to their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; Additionally, it is recommended that for every tree that is cut down that another one be planted elsewhere in the forest.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

==Economic effects of animal observation==

===Costs of observation===
Typically, the costs of animal observation are minuscule. As previously stated, animal observation can be done on a small or large scale; it just depends what goal an individual has in mind. For example, animal observation can be performed in the backyard of a house or at a local state park at no charge. All one would have to do is take a notepad, phone, or other device to write down their data and observations. On a larger scale, animal observation could be performed at an animal reserve, where the associated costs would be those associated with keeping the animals happy inside the reserve.

While it is impossible to pinpoint exactly how much the zoos across the world spend on live streaming, it is estimated to be in the $1,000 range for every camera that is set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livestream.com/platform/pricing|title=Livestream {{!}} Plans &amp; Pricing|website=Livestream|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs that observation prevents===
Referring back to the example from the "Deceased Wildlife Observation" section, it becomes apparent how animal observation can save families and the government money. With the average cost of repairing a car that has damage from a large sized animal being $2,000, families and the government could save money by making the public aware that they should proceed with caution in areas where animals have been hit.&lt;ref name="Roadkill statistics"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hcn.org/issues/291/15268|title=Roadkill statistics|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pollution in Maracaibo lake.jpg|thumb|298x298px|Water pollution at Maracaibo lake]]
Additionally, approximately $44 million of the $4.3 billion spent on water purity is spent each year on protecting aquatic species from nutrient pollution.&lt;ref name="Roadkill statistics"/&gt; It is encouraging that the government is willing to spend the money to help save animals' lives, sometimes the effects of the pollution take effect before they are able to stop them entirely.  One million seabirds and hundred thousand aquatic mammals and fish that are killed as a result of water pollution each year and that has its economic effects, both directly and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-pollution|title=11 Facts About Pollution {{!}} DoSomething.org {{!}} Volunteer for Social Change|website=www.dosomething.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directly, the loss of aquatic mammals and fish has a direct impact on the sales of food. The EPA estimated recently that the effects of pollution cost the fishing industry tens of millions of dollars in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/effects-economy|title=The Effects: Economy|last=EPA,OW,OWOW|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirectly, the loss of birds causes humans to spend more money on pest control because the food chain is out of order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whatdobirdseat.info|title=What do Birds Eat?|website=www.whatdobirdseat.info|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small rodents and insects that some birds prey upon are no longer being killed if the birds die. This means more of these pests find their ways into homes which causes more people to call exterminators, therefore setting off a chain reaction. The exterminators then must use insecticides to kill the animals which can have harmful runoff into the ground and local water systems, instead of allowing it to be done naturally by the animal food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toxicsaction.org/problems-and-solutions/pesticides|title=The Problem with Pesticides {{!}} Toxics Action Center|website=www.toxicsaction.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terminal 3''', also known by the trademarked name '''Worldport''', was an [[airport terminal]] built by [[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am) in 1960 at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]]. It opened on May 24, 1960 and ceased operations on May 24, 2013; it was demolished in late 2013.

==History==
===Original use===
[[Image:Pan Am Worldport overview.jpg|thumb|left|The distinctive "flying saucer" roof design of the Worldport]]
The terminal was originally known as the "Pan Am Terminal" or Pan Am "Unit Terminal Building (UTB)." It was designed by Ives, Turano &amp; Gardner Associated Architects and Walther Prokosch of Tippets-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton as a showcase for international jet travel and is particularly famous for its {{convert|4|acre|ha|adj=on}} "flying saucer" roof suspended far from the outside columns of the terminal by 32 sets of pre-stressed steel posts and cables. The terminal was designed to allow for aircraft to be parked under the partial overhang; marketing brochures promoted it as the jet-age terminal that brought the plane to the passenger. The overhang sheltered passengers as they boarded the aircraft by stairs or by uncovered bridges. The [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) ''Guide to New York City'' called the terminal a "genuine architectural attempt to answer the problem of all-weather connections to the planes" but derided the overall concept as "compromised by an overabundance of distracting detail".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=AIA Guide to New York City |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0gj61QSgk8C&amp;pg=PA811&amp;lpg=PA811 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=November 30, 2012 |author=White, Norval |author2=Willensky, Elliot |author3=Leadon, Fran |page=811 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's facade originally featured [[zodiac]] figures made by sculptor [[Milton Hebald]],&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Sanka. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0812F73E5916738DDDAA0894DE405B808AF1D3 "IDLEWILD SKYLINE GETS AN ADDITION; New Pan Am Terminal Looks Like Parasol to Motorists Approaching Airport"], [[New York Times]], June 3, 1960. Accessed October 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; although these were later removed by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-68708702.html "Outrage.(Pan American airport terminal in disrepair)"], ''[[Architectural Review]]'', December 2000. Accessed October 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The terminal featured the Panorama Room, a dining room with a view of the entire concourse, and the Clipper Hall museum of Pan Am history.

In 1971, the terminal was expanded to accommodate the large [[Boeing 747]] and renamed the "Pan Am Worldport". The Worldport was the world's largest airline terminal and held the title for several years.

Operation of the Worldport changed hands when Pan Am declared bankruptcy in 1991. [[Delta Air Lines]] acquired many of Pan Am's assets, including the lease on the Worldport, which became known simply as "Terminal 3", and operated most of its long-haul flights out of JFK to Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America from the building.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In March 2006, Delta COO Jim Whitehurst announced that Delta would spend US$10 million before the end of that year to renovate Terminal 2 and Terminal 3, including its public spaces, BusinessElite lounge, and Crown Room Clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Delta Air Lines To Surpass American In JFK Departures |first=Jay |last=Boehmer |url=http://www.businesstravelnews.com/More-News/Articles/Delta-Air-Lines-To-Surpass-American-In-JFK-Departures/ |work=Business Travel News |date=March 20, 2006 |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the July 2007 issue of Delta's ''Sky Magazine'', Delta Senior Vice President Joanne Smith remarked on the "distinctive" saucer roof in an article on new flooring, lighting, and signage at this "historic airport".

===Redevelopment and preservation campaign===
On August 4, 2010, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Delta was planning to move its international flights to Terminal 4 following the construction of nine additional gates in Concourse B of that terminal. Delta's domestic flights would continue to be operated out of Terminal 2. Terminal 3 would subsequently be demolished to create additional [[hardstand|aircraft parking]] between Terminals 2 and 4. Construction of the Terminal 4 expansion began in November 2010 and was completed in May 2013.

On May 23, 2013, the final departure from Terminal 3, [[Delta Air Lines]] Flight 268, a [[Boeing 747-400]] to [[Tel Aviv]] [[Ben Gurion Airport]], departed from Gate 6 at 11:25pm local time. The terminal ceased operations on the next day, 53 years to the day from when it opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Frischling |first=Steven |title=Photographer |url=http://boardingarea.com/blogs/flyingwithfish/2013/05/17/a-historic-chapter-in-aviation-closes-it-wont-be-documented/ |accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Historic Preservation|Preservation]] groups campaigned to save the building and have it nominated by the New York [[State Historic Preservation Office]] as a [[National Register of Historic Places|historic place]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Save The Pan Am Worldport |url=http://www.facebook.com/PanAmWorldport |accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 19, 2013, the Worldport was placed on the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]'s [[America's Most Endangered Places|list of 11 Most Endangered Places in America]] for 2013,&lt;ref name="historic sites lost" /&gt; but by June 25, 2013, demolition of the elevated roadway leading to the terminal had already begun, although preservationists continued to protest against the demolition of the building itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Preservationists fight to save Pan Am terminal 'Worldport' at JFK airport |author=Clare Trapasso |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/preservationists-cry-save-worldport-article-1.1382281 |newspaper=New York Daily News |date=June 25, 2013 |accessdate=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York State Historic Preservation Office, which had revoked the building's eligibility for the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2001,&lt;ref name="2012 FOIL Request"&gt;{{cite web |last=Worldport |first=Save the |title=2012 SHPO FOIL |url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.491185194238416.114871.131386373551635&amp;type=3 |work=Remembering the Pan Am Worldport |accessdate=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; upheld this decision in May 2013, claiming the building had lost significant historic integrity due to excessive modifications.

The preservation campaign was ultimately unsuccessful and demolition of the flying saucer section was completed on November 22, 2013. Demolition work on the remainder of the terminal completed in summer 2014. The National Trust for Historic Preservation cited the Worldport as one of ten historic sites lost in 2013.&lt;ref name="historic sites lost"&gt;{{cite news |last=staff |title=A look at 10 historic sites save, 10 lost in 2013 |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] as reported by the [[Post Crescent]] |date=January 5, 2014 |page=F3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was subsequently large media outcry, particularly in other countries, concerning the demolition of the Worldport. Several online petitions requesting the restoration of the original 'flying saucer' have gained popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Port Authority Approves Construction |url=http://www.panynj.gov/press-room/press-item.cfm?headLine_id=1309 |publisher=[[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New Plans For Expanding Terminal 4 at JFK Airport |url=http://home2.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fhome2.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2010b%2Fpr348-10.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1 |publisher=NYC Office of the Mayor |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Plans for Enhancement and Expansion of Terminal 4 at JFK Airport |url=http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=1095 |publisher=[[Delta Air Lines]] |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Details Of JFK Improvements&amp;nbsp;– Civil Aviation Forum |url=http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/4895622/ |publisher=Airliners.net |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zoology''' ({{IPAc-en|z|u|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i|,_|z|oʊ|-}}) or '''animal biology''' is the branch of [[biology]] that studies the animal kingdom, including the [[anatomy|structure]], [[embryology]], [[evolution]], [[Biological classification|classification]], [[Ethology|habits]], and distribution of all [[animal]]s, both living and [[extinction|extinct]], and how they interact with their ecosystems. The term is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] ζῷον, ''zōion'', i.e. "[[animal]]" and λόγος, ''logos'', i.e. "knowledge, study".&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=zoology|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=zoology&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient history to Darwin===
[[File:Gessner Conrad 1516-1565.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Conrad Gesner]] (1516–1565). His ''[[Historiae animalium (Gesner)|Historiae animalium]]'' is considered the beginning of modern zoology.]]
{{Main article|History of zoology (through 1859)}}

The history of zoology traces the study of the [[animal|animal kingdom]] from ancient to modern times. Although the concept of ''zoology'' as a single coherent field arose much later, the zoological sciences emerged from [[natural history]] reaching back to the [[Aristotle's biology|biological works of Aristotle]] and [[Galen]] in the ancient [[Greco-Roman world]]. This ancient work was further developed in the Middle Ages by [[Islamic medicine|Muslim physicians]] and scholars such as [[Albertus Magnus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mehmet|last=Bayrakdar |year=1986 |title=Al-Jahiz and the rise of biological evolution |journal=Ankara Üniversitesi İlahiyat Fakültesi Dergisi |publisher=[[Ankara University|Ankara Üniversitesi İlahiyat Fakültesi]]|volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=307–15 |url=http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/37/772/9842.pdf |doi=10.1501/Ilhfak_0000000674|accessdate=21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thinking about Life: The History and Philosophy of Biology and Other Sciences|author1=Paul S. Agutter  |author2=Denys N. Wheatley |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=1-4020-8865-5|page=43|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Saint Albertus Magnus |title=On Animals: A Medieval Summa Zoologica |year=1999 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-4823-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Renaissance]] and early modern period, zoological thought was revolutionized in Europe by a renewed interest in [[empiricism]] and the discovery of many novel organisms. Prominent in this movement were [[Vesalius]] and [[William Harvey]], who used experimentation and careful observation in physiology, and naturalists such as [[Carl Linnaeus]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] who began to [[Scientific classification|classify the diversity of life]] and the [[fossil record]], as well as the development and behavior of organisms. [[Microscopy]] revealed the previously unknown world of microorganisms, laying the groundwork for [[cell theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lois N. Magner |title=A History of the Life Sciences, Revised and Expanded |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press |pages=133–144 |isbn=0-8247-0824-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The growing importance of [[natural theology]], partly a response to the rise of [[mechanical philosophy]], encouraged the growth of [[natural history]] (although it entrenched the [[teleological argument|argument from design]]).

Over the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, zoology became an increasingly professional [[scientific discipline]]. Explorer-naturalists such as [[Alexander von Humboldt]] investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography, laying the foundations for [[biogeography]], [[ecology]] and [[ethology]]. Naturalists began to reject [[essentialism]] and consider the importance of [[extinction]] and the [[history of evolutionary thought|mutability of species]]. [[Cell theory]] provided a new perspective on the fundamental basis of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jan Sapp |title=Genesis: The Evolution of Biology |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Chapter 7 |isbn=0-19-515619-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Coleman |title=Biology in the Nineteenth Century |year=1978 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter=Chapter 2 |isbn=0-521-29293-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Darwin===
{{Main article|History of zoology (since 1859)}}
These developments, as well as the results from [[embryology]] and [[paleontology]], were synthesized in [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. In 1859, Darwin placed the theory of organic evolution on a new footing, by his discovery of a process by which organic evolution can occur, and provided observational evidence that it had done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |author=Jerry A. Coyne |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn=0-19-923084-6 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin gave a new direction to [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[physiology]], by uniting them in a common biological theory: the theory of organic evolution. The result was a reconstruction of the classification of animals upon a [[genealogical]] basis, fresh investigation of the development of animals, and early attempts to determine their genetic relationships. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of [[spontaneous generation]] and the rise of the [[germ theory of disease]], though the mechanism of [[biological inheritance|inheritance]] remained a mystery. In the early 20th century, the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel's]] work led to the rapid development of [[genetics]], and by the 1930s the combination of [[population genetics]] and natural selection in the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] created [[evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Science and Creationism: a view from the National Academy of Sciences |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=28 |format=php |accessdate= September 24, 2009 |edition=Second |year= 1999 |publisher=The National Academy of Sciences |location=Washington, DC |isbn=-0-309-06406-6 |page=28 |chapter=Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions |chapterurl=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=27#p200064869970027001 |ref=NAS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===Structural===
[[Cell biology]] studies the structural and [[physiology|physiological]] properties of [[cell (biology)|cells]], including their [[behavior]], interactions, and [[natural environment|environment]]. This is done on both the [[microscope|microscopic]] and [[molecule|molecular]] levels, for single-celled organisms such as [[bacterium|bacteria]] as well as the specialized cells in multicellular organisms such as [[human]]s.  Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.

[[Anatomy]] considers the forms of macroscopic structures such as [[organ (biology)|organs]] and organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Henry Gray |title=Anatomy of the Human Body |year=1918 |publisher=Lea &amp; Febiger|url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on how organs and organ systems work together in the bodies of humans and animals, in addition to how they work independently. Anatomy and cell biology are two studies that are closely related, and can be categorized under "structural" studies.

===Physiological===
[[File:Dog anatomy anterior view.jpg|thumb|Animal anatomical engraving from ''Handbuch der Anatomie der Tiere für Künstler''.]]
Physiology studies the mechanical, physical, and biochemical processes of living organisms by attempting to understand how all of the structures function as a whole. The theme of "structure to function" is central to biology. Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into [[plant physiology]] and [[animal physiology]], but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular [[organism]] is being studied. For example, what is learned about the physiology of [[yeast]] cells can also apply to human cells. The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of [[human physiology]] to non-human species. Physiology studies how for example [[nervous system|nervous]], [[immune system|immune]], [[endocrine system|endocrine]], [[respiratory system|respiratory]], and [[circulatory system|circulatory]] systems, function and interact.

===Evolutionary===
Evolutionary research is concerned with the origin and descent of [[species]], as well as their change over time, and includes scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines. For example, it generally involves scientists who have special training in particular [[organism]]s such as [[mammalogy]], [[ornithology]], [[herpetology]], or [[entomology]], but use those organisms as systems to answer general questions about evolution.

Evolutionary biology is partly based on [[paleontology]], which uses the [[fossil]] record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution,&lt;ref name=Jablonski&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jablonski D |title=The future of the fossil record |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5423 |pages=2114–16 |year=1999 |pmid=10381868 |doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2114 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and partly on the developments in areas such as [[population genetics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John H. Gillespie |title=Population Genetics: A Concise Guide |year=1998 |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press |isbn=978-0-8018-8008-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and evolutionary theory. Following the development of [[DNA profiling|DNA fingerprinting]] techniques in the late 20th century, the application of these techniques in zoology has increased the understanding of animal populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chambers|first=Geoffrey K.|last2=Curtis|first2=Caitlin|last3=Millar|first3=Craig D.|last4=Huynen|first4=Leon|last5=Lambert|first5=David M.|date=2014-01-01|title=DNA fingerprinting in zoology: past, present, future|journal=Investigative Genetics|volume=5|issue=1|pages=3|doi=10.1186/2041-2223-5-3|issn=2041-2223|pmc=3909909|pmid=24490906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s, [[developmental biology]] re-entered evolutionary biology from its initial exclusion from the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] through the study of [[evolutionary developmental biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vassiliki Betty Smocovitis |title=Unifying Biology: The Evolutionary Synthesis and Evolutionary Biology |year=1996 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03343-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology are [[phylogenetics]], [[systematics]], and [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]].

===Classification===
[[Biological classification|Scientific classification in zoology]], is a method by which zoologists group and categorize [[organism]]s by [[biological type]], such as [[genus]] or [[species]]. Biological classification is a form of [[Taxonomy (biology)|scientific taxonomy]]. Modern biological classification has its root in the work of [[Carl Linnaeus]], who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to improve consistency with the [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] principle of [[common descent]]. [[Molecular phylogenetics]], which uses [[DNA sequences]] as data, has driven many recent revisions and is likely to continue to do so. Biological classification belongs to the science of [[systematics|zoological systematics]].

[[File:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png|thumb|left|Linnaeus's table of the animal kingdom from the first edition of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735).]]
Many scientists now consider the [[five-kingdom system]] outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally start with the [[three-domain system]]: [[Archaea]] (originally Archaebacteria); [[Bacterium|Bacteria]] (originally Eubacteria); [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]] (including [[protist]]s, [[fungi]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s)&lt;ref name="domain"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woese C, Kandler O, Wheelis M | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/87/12/4576 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576–9 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2112744 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | pmc = 54159 | ref = harv | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of the cell exteriors.&lt;ref name="domain"/&gt;

Further, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is:
[[Domain (biology)|Domain]]; [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]; [[phylum]]; [[Class (biology)|class]]; [[Order (biology)|order]]; [[Family (biology)|family]]; [[genus]]; [[species]]. The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. ''Homo'' is the genus, and ''sapiens'' the specific epithet, both of them combined make up the species name. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=hVUU7Gq8QskC&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=species%20epithet%20capitalize&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q=species%20epithet%20capitalize | page = 198 | title = Writing for Science and Engineering: Papers, Presentation | author = Heather Silyn-Roberts | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-7506-4636-5 | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann | location = Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant classification system is called the [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. It includes ranks and [[binomial nomenclature]]. The classification, [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and nomenclature of zoological organisms is administered by the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]. A merging draft, BioCode, was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature, but has yet to be formally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=The BioCode: Integrated biological nomenclature for the 21st century? | booktitle=Proceedings of a Mini-Symposium on Biological Nomenclature in the 21st Century | author=John McNeill | date=4 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethology===
[[File:Larus Dominicanus with young.jpg|right|thumb|[[Kelp gull]] chicks peck at red spot on mother's beak to stimulate the regurgitating reflex.]]
[[Ethology]] is the [[scientific method|scientific]] and objective study of animal behavior under natural conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of ETHOLOGY|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethology|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=30 October 2012|quote=2 : the scientific and objective study of animal behaviour especially under natural conditions }}&lt;/ref&gt;  as opposed to [[behaviourism]], which focuses on behavioral response studies in a laboratory setting.  Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the [[evolution]] of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of [[natural selection]]. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was [[Charles Darwin]], whose book, ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]],'' influenced many future ethologists.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmc = 1279921 | pmid = 12042386 |date=Jun 2002 | author = Black, J | title = Darwin in the world of emotions | volume = 95 | issue = 6 | pages = 311–3 | issn = 0141-0768 | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | url = http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12042386 | format = Free full text | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.95.6.311 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biogeography===

[[Biogeography]] studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the [[Earth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wiley, R. H. |year=1981 |title=Social structure and individual ontogenies: problems of description, mechanism, and evolution |journal= Perspectives in ethology |volume=4 |issue= |pages=105–133 |url=http://www.unc.edu/home/rhwiley/pdfs/IndividualOntogenies.pdf |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on topics like [[plate tectonics]], [[climate change]], [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] and [[Animal migration|migration]], and [[cladistics]]. The creation of this study is widely accredited to [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], a British biologist who had some of his work jointly published with [[Charles Darwin]].

Although the study of animal life is ancient, its scientific incarnation is relatively modern. This mirrors the transition from [[natural history]] to [[biology]] at the start of the 19th century. Since [[John Hunter (surgeon)|Hunter]] and [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]], comparative [[Anatomy|anatomical]] study has been associated with morphography, shaping the modern areas of zoological investigation:  [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[histology]], [[embryology]], [[teratology]] and [[ethology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/zoology#toc48756|title=zoology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern zoology first arose in German and British universities. In Britain, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was a prominent figure. His ideas were centered on the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of animals. Many consider him the greatest comparative anatomist of the latter half of the 19th century. Similar to [[John Hunter (surgeon)|Hunter]], his courses were composed of lectures and laboratory practical classes in contrast to the previous format of lectures only.

Gradually zoology expanded beyond Huxley's [[comparative anatomy]] to include the following sub-disciplines:
* [[Zoography]], also known as ''descriptive zoology'', is the applied science of describing animals and their [[habitat]]s
* [[Comparative anatomy]] studies the structure of animals
* [[Animal physiology]]
* [[Behavioral ecology]]
* [[Ethology]] studies animal behavior
* [[Invertebrate zoology]]
* [[Vertebrate zoology]]
* [[Soil zoology]]
* The various taxonomically oriented disciplines such as [[mammalogy]], [[biological anthropology]], [[herpetology]], [[ornithology]], and [[entomology]] identify and classify [[species]] and study the structures and mechanisms specific to those groups.

Related fields:
* [[Evolutionary biology]]: Development of both animals and plants is considered in the articles on [[evolution]], [[population genetics]], [[heredity]], [[Genetic variability|variation]], [[Mendelism]], and [[reproduction]].
* [[Molecular biology]] studies the common [[genetics|genetic]] and developmental mechanisms of animals and plants
* [[Palaeontology]]
* [[Systematics]], [[cladistics]], [[phylogenetics]], [[phylogeography]], [[biogeography]], and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] classify and group species via common descent and regional associations.
