'''Alfred Marshall''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (26 July 1842 – 13 July 1924) was one of the most influential [[economist]]s of his time. His book, ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]'' (1890), was the dominant economic textbook in England for many years. It brings the ideas of [[supply and demand]], [[marginal utility]], and [[costs of production]] into a coherent whole. He is known as one of the founders of [[neoclassical economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://economics.illinoisstate.edu/ntskaggs/eco372/readings/alfred_marshall.htm|title=Alfred Marshall|website=economics.illinoisstate.edu|access-date=2017-06-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107181816/http://economics.illinoisstate.edu/ntskaggs/eco372/readings/alfred_marshall.htm|archivedate=7 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Marshall took [[economics]] to a more mathematically rigorous level, he did not want mathematics to overshadow economics and thus make economics irrelevant to the layman.

==Life and career==
Marshall was born in London. His father was a bank cashier and devout Evangelical.  Marshall grew up in [[Clapham]] and was educated at the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he demonstrated an aptitude in mathematics, achieving the rank of [[Second Wrangler]] in the 1865 [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MRSL861A|name=Marshall, Alfred}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall experienced a mental crisis that led him to abandon physics and switch to philosophy. He began with metaphysics, specifically "the philosophical foundation of knowledge, especially in relation to theology.".&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphysics led Marshall to ethics, specifically a [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwickian]] version of utilitarianism; ethics, in turn, led him to economics, because economics played an essential role in providing the preconditions for the improvement of the working class.

He saw that the duty of economics was to improve material conditions, but such improvement would occur, Marshall believed, only in connection with social and political forces. His interest in [[Georgism]], liberalism, socialism, trade unions, women's education, poverty and progress reflect the influence of his early social philosophy on his later activities and writings.

Marshall was elected in 1865 to a fellowship at St John's College at Cambridge, and became lecturer in the moral sciences in 1868. In 1885 he became professor of political economy at Cambridge, where he remained until his retirement in 1908.  Over the years he interacted with many British thinkers including [[Henry Sidgwick]], [[William Kingdon Clifford|W.K. Clifford]], [[Benjamin Jowett]], [[William Stanley Jevons]], [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]], [[John Neville Keynes]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]].  Marshall founded the "[[Cambridge School (economics)|Cambridge School]]" which paid special attention to increasing returns, the theory of the firm, and welfare economics; after his retirement leaderships passed to [[Arthur Cecil Pigou]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]].

==Contributions to economics==
[[File:Marshall - Elements of economics of industry, 1892 - 5745225.tif |thumb|''Elements of economics of industry'', 1892]]

Marshall desired to improve the mathematical rigour of economics and transform it into a more scientific profession. In the 1870s he wrote a small number of tracts on international trade and the problems of protectionism. In 1879, many of these works were compiled into a work entitled ''The Theory of Foreign Trade: The Pure Theory of Domestic Values''. In the same year (1879) he published ''The Economics of Industry'' with his wife [[Mary Paley]].

Although Marshall took economics to a more mathematically rigorous level, he did not want mathematics to overshadow economics and thus make economics irrelevant to the layman.  Accordingly, Marshall tailored the text of his books to laymen and put the mathematical content in the footnotes and appendices for the professionals.  In a letter to [[A. L. Bowley]], he laid out the following system: {{blockquote|(1) Use mathematics as shorthand language, rather than as an engine of inquiry.  (2) Keep to them till you have done. (3) Translate into English.  (4) Then illustrate by examples that are important in real life (5) Burn the mathematics.  (6) If you can't succeed in 4, burn 3.  This I do often."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dimand|first=Robert W.|year=2007|title=Keynes, IS-LM, and the Marshallian Tradition|journal=History of Political Economy|publisher=Duke University Press|volume=39|issue=1|pages=81–95|doi=10.1215/00182702-2006-024}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marshall had been Mary Paley's professor of political economy at Cambridge and the two were married in 1877, forcing Marshall to leave his position as a [[Fellow (college)|Fellow]] of [[St John's College, Cambridge]] to comply with celibacy rules at the university. He became the first principal at [[University College, Bristol]], which was the institution that later became the [[University of Bristol]], again lecturing on political economy and economics. He perfected his ''Economics of Industry'' while at Bristol, and published it more widely in England as an economic curriculum; its simple form stood upon sophisticated theoretical foundations. Marshall achieved a measure of fame from this work, and upon the death of [[William Jevons]] in 1882, Marshall became the leading British economist of the scientific school of his time.

Marshall returned to Cambridge, via a brief period at [[Balliol College, Oxford]] during 1883–4, to take the seat as [[Professor of Political Economy, Cambridge University|Professor of Political Economy]] in 1884 on the death of [[Henry Fawcett]]. At Cambridge he endeavoured to create a new [[tripos]] for economics, a goal which he would only achieve in 1903. Until that time, economics was taught under the Historical and Moral Sciences Triposes which failed to provide Marshall the kind of energetic and specialised students he desired.

===''Principles of Economics'' (1890)===
{{main|Principles of Economics (Marshall)}}
Marshall began his economic work, the ''Principles of Economics'', in 1881, and spent much of the next decade at work on the treatise. His plan for the work gradually extended to a two-volume compilation on the whole of economic thought. The first volume was published in 1890 to worldwide acclaim, establishing him as one of the leading economists of his time. The second volume, which was to address foreign trade, money, trade fluctuations, taxation, and [[collectivism]], was never published.

''Principles of Economics'' established his worldwide reputation. It appeared in 8 editions, starting at 750 pages and growing to 870 pages. It decisively shaped the teaching of economics in English-speaking countries. Its main technical contribution was a masterful analysis of the issues of [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]], [[consumer surplus]], increasing and [[diminishing returns]], short and long terms, and [[marginal utility]]. Many of the ideas were original with Marshall; others were improved versions of the ideas by [[W. S. Jevons]] and others.

In a broader sense Marshall hoped to reconcile the classical and modern theories of value. [[John Stuart Mill]] had examined the relationship between the value of commodities and their production costs, on the theory that value depends on the effort expended in manufacture. Jevons and the [[Marginal Utility]] theorists had elaborated a theory of value based on the idea of maximising utility, holding that value depends on demand. Marshall's work used both these approaches, but he focused more on costs. He noted that, in the short run, supply cannot be changed and market value depends mainly on demand. In an intermediate time period, production can be expanded by existing facilities, such as buildings and machinery, but, since these do not require renewal within this intermediate period, their costs (called fixed, overhead, or supplementary costs) have little influence on the sale price of the product. Marshall pointed out that it is the prime or variable costs, which constantly recur, that influence the sale price most in this period. In a still longer period, machines and buildings wear out and have to be replaced, so that the sale price of the product must be high enough to cover such [[replacement cost]]s. This classification of costs into fixed and variable and the emphasis given to the element of time probably represent one of Marshall's chief contributions to economic theory. He was committed to [[partial equilibrium]] models over [[general equilibrium]] on the grounds that the inherently dynamical nature of economics made the former more practically useful.

[[File:Marshall's Supply and Demand Graph.png|thumb|right|240px|alt=|Alfred Marshall's supply and demand graph.]]

Much of the success of Marshall's teaching and ''Principles'' book derived from his effective use of diagrams, which were soon emulated by other teachers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Marshall was the first to develop the standard supply and demand graph demonstrating a number of fundamentals regarding supply and demand including the supply and demand curves, market equilibrium, the relationship between quantity and price in regards to supply and demand, the law of marginal utility, the law of diminishing returns, and the ideas of consumer and producer surpluses.  This model is now used by economists in various forms using different variables to demonstrate several other economic principles.  Marshall's model allowed a visual representation of complex economic fundamentals where before all the ideas and theories were only capable of being explained through words.  These models are now critical throughout the study of economics because they allow a clear and concise representation of the fundamentals or theories being explained.

===Theoretical contributions===
Marshall is considered to be one of the most influential economists of his time, largely shaping [[mainstream economics|mainstream economic thought]] for the next fifty years, and being one of the founders of the school of [[neoclassical economics]]. Although his economics was advertised as extensions and refinements of the work of [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], he extended economics away from its [[classical economics|classical]] focus on the market economy and instead popularised it as a study of human behaviour. He downplayed the contributions of certain other economists to his work, such as [[Léon Walras]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Jules Dupuit]], and only grudgingly acknowledged the influence of [[William Stanley Jevons|Stanley Jevons]] himself.

Marshall was one of those who used utility analysis, but not as a theory of value. He used it as a part of the theory to explain demand curves and the principle of substitution. Marshall's [[scissors analysis]] – which combined demand and supply, that is, utility and cost of production, as if in the two blades of a pair of scissors – effectively removed the theory of value from the center of analysis and replaced it with the theory of price. While the term "value" continued to be used, for most people it was a synonym for "price". Prices no longer were thought to gravitate toward some ultimate and absolute basis of price; prices were existential, between the relationship of demand and supply.

Marshall's influence on codifying economic thought is difficult to deny. He popularised the use of [[supply and demand]] functions as tools of price determination (previously discovered independently by [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]]); modern economists owe the linkage between price shifts and curve shifts to Marshall. Marshall was an important part of the "[[marginalist]] revolution;" the idea that consumers attempt to adjust consumption until [[marginal utility]] equals the price was another of his contributions. The [[price elasticity of demand]] was presented by Marshall as an extension of these ideas. Economic welfare, divided into [[producer surplus]] and [[consumer surplus]], was contributed by Marshall, and indeed, the two are sometimes described eponymously as '[[Marshallian surplus]].' He used this idea of surplus to rigorously analyse the effect of taxes and price shifts on market welfare. Marshall also identified [[quasi-rent]]s.

Marshall's brief references to the social and cultural relations in the "[[industrial district]]s" of England were used as a starting point for late twentieth-century work in [[economic geography]] and [[institutional economics]] on [[Business cluster|clustering]] and [[learning organisations]].

[[Gary Becker]] (1930-2014), the 1992 Nobel prize winner in economics, has mentioned that Milton Friedman and Alfred Marshall were the two greatest influences on his work.

Another contribution that Marshall made was differentiating concepts of internal and external [[economies of scale]]. That is that when costs of input factors of production go down, it is a positive externality for all the firms in the market place, outside the control of any of the firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=External Economies of Scale|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/012703.asp#axzz1WK4kQ0T3|publisher=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Marshallian industrial district===
A concept based on a pattern of organisation that was common in late nineteenth century Britain in which firms concentrating on the manufacture of certain products were geographically clustered. Comments made by Marshall in Book 4, Chapter 10 of ''Principles of Economics''&lt;ref&gt;Fiorenza Belussi, "Industrial Districts/Local Production Systems as hypernetworks: a neo-Marshallian interpretive frame", in Marco Enrico Luigi Guidi, ''The changing firm, contributions from the history of economic thought''&lt;/ref&gt; have been used by economists and economic geographers to discuss this phenomenon.

The two dominant characteristics of a Marshallian industrial district&lt;ref&gt;
[http://dspace.unav.es/dspace/handle/10171/6115 Alfred Marshall y la teoría económica del empresario, Jesus M. Zaratiegui] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912205751/http://dspace.unav.es/dspace/handle/10171/6115 |date=12 September 2010 }}
.&lt;/ref&gt; are high degrees of vertical and horizontal specialisation and a very heavy reliance on market mechanism for exchange. Firms tend to be small and to focus on a single function in the production chain. Firms located in industrial districts are highly competitive in the [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] sense, and in many cases there is little product differentiation. The major advantages of Marshallian industrial districts arise from simple propinquity of firms, which allows easier recruitment of skilled labour and rapid exchanges of commercial and technical information through informal channels. They illustrate competitive capitalism at its most efficient, with [[transaction costs]] reduced to a practical minimum, but they are feasible only when [[economies of scale]] are limited.

==Later career==
Marshall served as [[List of Presidents of Co-operative Congress|President]] of the first day of the 1889 [[Co-operative Congress]].&lt;ref name=PDF&gt;{{Cite web|title=Congress Presidents 1869–2002 |url=http://archive.co-op.ac.uk/downloadFiles/congressPresidentstable.pdf |date=February 2002 |accessdate=10 May 2008 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528100558/http://archive.co-op.ac.uk/downloadFiles/congressPresidentstable.pdf |archivedate=28 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next two decades he worked to complete the second volume of his ''Principles,'' but his unyielding attention to detail and ambition for completeness prevented him from mastering the work's breadth. The work was never finished and many other, lesser works he had begun work on – a memorandum on trade policy for the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the 1890s, for instance – were left incomplete for the same reasons.

His health problems had gradually grown worse since the 1880s, and in 1908 he retired from the university. He hoped to continue work on his ''Principles'' but his health continued to deteriorate and the project had continued to grow with each further investigation. The outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 prompted him to revise his examinations of the international economy and in 1919 he published ''Industry and Trade'' at the age of 77. This work was a more empirical treatise than the largely theoretical ''Principles'', and for that reason it failed to attract as much acclaim from theoretical economists. In 1923, he published ''Money, Credit, and Commerce,'' a broad amalgam of previous economic ideas, published and unpublished, stretching back a half-century.

==Final years, death and legacy==
From 1890 to 1924 he was the respected father of the economic profession and to most economists for the half-century after his death, the venerable grandfather. He had shied away from controversy during his life in a way that previous leaders of the profession had not, although his even-handedness drew great respect and even reverence from fellow economists, and his home at [[Balliol Croft]] in Cambridge had no shortage of distinguished guests. His students at Cambridge became leading figures in economics, including [[John Maynard Keynes]] and [[Arthur Cecil Pigou]]. His most important legacy was creating a respected, academic, scientifically founded profession for economists in the future that set the tone of the field for the remainder of the 20th century.

Marshall died aged 81 at his home in Cambridge and is buried in the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Ascension Parish Burial Ground]].&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to Churchill College, Cambridge: text by Dr. [[Mark Goldie]], pages 62 and 63 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The library of the Department of Economics at Cambridge University ([[The Marshall Library of Economics]]), the Economics society at Cambridge (The Marshall Society)&lt;ref&gt;marshallsociety.com&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[University of Bristol]] Economics department are named after him. His archive is available for consultation by appointment at the Marshall Library of Economics.&lt;ref&gt;A finding aid to his materials is available at {{cite web|url=http://www.marshall.econ.cam.ac.uk/archives/archivescollections|title=Marshall Library Archives - Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His home, Balliol Croft, was renamed [[Marshall House, Cambridge|Marshall House]] in 1991 in his honour when it was bought by [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lucy-cav.cam.ac.uk/media/college/documents/site-buildings.pdf |title=Lucy Cavendish College Site and Buildings |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927015027/http://www.lucy-cav.cam.ac.uk/media/college/documents/site-buildings.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Marshall's wife was [[Mary Paley]], co-founder of Newnham College; she continued to live in Balliol Croft until her death in 1944; her ashes were scattered in the garden.

[[Image:Neusis-trisection.svg|thumb|right|Angles may be trisected via a [[neusis construction]] using tools beyond an unmarked [[straightedge]] and a [[compass (drafting)|compass]]. The example shows trisection of any angle {{math|θ&gt;{{sfrac|3π|4}}}} by a ruler with length equal to the radius of the circle, giving trisected angle {{math|φ{{=}}{{sfrac|θ|3}}}}.]]

'''Angle trisection''' is a classical problem of [[compass and straightedge constructions]] of ancient [[Greek mathematics]]. It concerns construction of an [[angle]] equal to one third of a given arbitrary angle, using only two tools: an unmarked [[straightedge]] and a [[compass (drafting)|compass]].

The problem as stated is [[Proof of impossibility|impossible]] to solve for arbitrary angles, as proved by [[Pierre Wantzel]] in 1837. However, although there is no way to trisect an angle ''in general'' with just a compass and a straightedge, some special angles can be trisected. For example, it is relatively straightforward to trisect a [[right angle]] (that is, to construct an angle of measure 30 degrees).

It is possible to trisect an arbitrary angle by using tools other than straightedge and compass. For example, [[neusis construction]], also known to ancient Greeks, involves simultaneous sliding and rotation of a marked straightedge, which cannot be achieved with the original tools. Other techniques were developed by mathematicians over the centuries.

Because it is defined in simple terms, but complex to prove unsolvable, the problem of angle trisection is a frequent subject of [[pseudomathematics|pseudomathematical]] attempts at solution by naive enthusiasts. These "solutions" often involve mistaken interpretations of the rules, or are simply incorrect.&lt;ref name="trisectors"/&gt;

==Background and problem statement==
[[Image:Bisection construction.gif|thumb|[[Bisection]] of [[arbitrary]] [[angle]]s has long been solved.]]
Using only an unmarked [[straightedge]] and a [[compass (drafting)|compass]], [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematicians]] found means to divide a [[Line (mathematics)|line]] into an arbitrary set of equal segments, to draw [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines, to [[Bisection#Angle bisector|bisect angle]]s, to construct many [[polygon]]s, and to construct [[Square (geometry)|square]]s of equal or twice the area of a given polygon.

Three problems proved elusive, specifically, trisecting the angle, [[doubling the cube]], and [[squaring the circle]]. The problem of angle trisection reads:

Construct an [[angle]] equal to one-third of a given arbitrary angle (or divide it into three equal angles), using only two tools:
# an unmarked [[straightedge]], and
# a [[compass (drafting)|compass]].

== Proof of impossibility ==
[[File:Lineale.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ruler]]s. The displayed ones are marked — an ideal [[straightedge]] is un-marked]]
[[File:Zirkel.jpg|thumb|right|[[compass (drafting)|compasses]]]]
Pierre Wantzel published a proof of the impossibility of classically trisecting an arbitrary angle in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wantzel|first=P M L|title=Recherches sur les moyens de reconnaître si un problème de Géométrie peut se résoudre avec la règle et le compas.|journal=Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées|date=1837|volume=2|series=1|pages=366–372|url=http://math-doc.ujf-grenoble.fr/JMPA/PDF/JMPA_1837_1_2_A31_0.pdf#2|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wantzel's proof, restated in modern terminology, uses the [[abstract algebra]] of [[field extension]]s, a topic now typically combined with [[Galois theory]]. However Wantzel published these results earlier than Galois (whose work was published in 1846) and did not use the connection between field extensions and [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] that is the subject of Galois theory itself.&lt;ref&gt;For the historical basis of Wantzel's proof in the earlier work of Ruffini and Abel, and its timing vis-a-vis Galois, see {{citation|title=History of Mathematics: A Supplement|first=Craig|last=Smorynski|publisher=Springer|year=2007|isbn= 9780387754802|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_zliInaOM8UC&amp;pg=PA130}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of constructing an angle of a given measure {{math|''θ''}} is equivalent to constructing two segments such that the ratio of their length is {{math|cos&amp;nbsp;''θ''}}. From a solution to one of these two problems, one may pass to a solution of the other by a compass and straightedge construction. The [[triple-angle formula]] gives an expression relating the cosines of the original angle and its trisection: {{math|cos&amp;nbsp;''θ''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{math|4cos&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(''θ''/3)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3cos(''θ''/3)}}. It follows that, given a segment that is defined to have unit length, the problem of angle trisection is equivalent to constructing a segment whose length is the root of a [[cubic polynomial]]. This equivalence reduces the original geometric problem to a purely algebraic problem.

Every rational number is constructible. Every [[irrational number]] that is  [[constructible number|constructible]] in a single step from some given numbers is a root of a [[polynomial]] of degree 2 with coefficients in the [[field (mathematics)|field]] generated by these numbers. Therefore, any number that is constructible by a sequence of steps is a root of a [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]] whose degree is a [[power of two]].  Note also that {{math|π/3}} [[radian]]s (60 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s, written 60°) is [[equilateral triangle|constructible]].  The argument below shows that it is impossible to construct a 20° angle. This implies that a 60° angle cannot be trisected, and thus that an arbitrary angle cannot be trisected.

Denote the set of [[rational numbers]] by {{math|'''Q'''}}. If 60° could be trisected, the degree of a minimal polynomial of {{math|cos(20°)}} over {{math|'''Q'''}} would be a power of two. Now let {{math|''x'' {{=}} cos(20°)}}. Note that {{math|cos(60°)}} = {{math|cos(π/3)}} = {{math|1/2}}. Then by the triple-angle formula, {{math|cos(π/3) {{=}} 4''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 3''x''}} and so {{math|4''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 3''x'' {{=}} 1/2}}. Thus {{math|8''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 6''x'' − 1 {{=}} 0}}. Define {{math|''p''(''t'')}} to be the polynomial {{math|''p''(''t'') {{=}} 8''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 6''t'' − 1}}.

Since {{math|''x'' {{=}} cos(20°)}} is a root of {{math|''p''(''t'')}}, the minimal polynomial for {{math|cos(20°)}} is a factor of {{math|''p''(''t'')}}.  Because {{math|''p''(''t'')}} has degree 3, if it is reducible over by {{math|'''Q'''}} then it has a [[rational root]].  By the [[rational root theorem]], this root must be {{math|±1, ±1/2, ±1/4}} or {{math|±1/8}}, but none of these is a root.  Therefore, {{math|''p''(''t'')}} is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over by {{math|'''Q'''}}, and the minimal polynomial for {{math|cos(20°)}} is of degree&amp;nbsp;{{math|3}}.

So an angle of measure {{math|60°}} cannot be trisected.

== Angles which can be trisected ==
However, some angles can be trisected. For example, for any [[constructible number|constructible]] angle {{math|''θ''}}, an angle of measure {{math|3''θ''}} can be trivially trisected by ignoring the given angle and directly constructing an angle of measure {{math|''θ''}}.  There are angles that are not constructible but are trisectible (despite the one-third angle itself being non-constructible).  For example, {{math|{{frac|3{{pi}}|7}}}} is such an angle: five angles of measure {{math|{{frac|3{{pi}}|7}}}} combine to make an angle of measure {{math|{{frac|15{{pi}}|7}}}}, which is a full circle plus the desired {{math|{{frac|{{pi}}|7}}}}.

For a [[positive integer]] {{mvar|N}}, an angle of measure {{math|{{frac|2{{pi}}|''N''}}}} is ''trisectible'' if and only if {{math|3}} does not divide {{mvar|N}}.&lt;ref&gt;MacHale, Desmond. "Constructing integer angles", ''Mathematical Gazette'' 66, June 1982, 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McLean&gt;McLean, K. Robin, "Trisecting angles with ruler and compasses", ''Mathematical Gazette'' 92, July 2008, 320–323.  See also Feedback on this article in vol. 93, March 2009, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, {{math|{{frac|2{{pi}}|''N''}}}} is ''constructible'' if and only if {{mvar|N}} is a power of {{math|2}} or the product of a power of {{math|2}} with the product of one or more distinct [[Fermat prime]]s.

===Algebraic characterization===
Again, denote the set of [[rational numbers]] by {{math|'''Q'''}}.

[[Theorem]]: An angle of measure {{math|''θ''}} may be trisected [[if and only if]] {{math|''q''(''t'') {{=}} 4''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 3''t'' − cos(''θ'')}} is reducible over the [[field extension]]  {{math|'''Q'''(cos(''θ''))}}.

The [[Mathematical proof|proof]] is a relatively straightforward generalization of the proof given above that a {{math|60°}} angle is not trisectible.&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite book | last = Stewart | first = Ian  | authorlink = Ian Stewart (mathematician) | title = ''[[Galois Theory]]'' | publisher = Chapman and Hall Mathematics | year = 1989 | pages = g. 58 | doi = | isbn = 0-412-34550-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other methods==
The general problem of angle trisection is solvable by using additional tools, and thus going outside of the original Greek framework of compass and straightedge.

Many incorrect methods of trisecting the general angle have been proposed.  Some of these methods provide reasonable approximations; others (some of which are mentioned below) involve tools not permitted in the classical problem.  The mathematician [[Underwood Dudley]] has detailed some of these failed attempts in his book ''The Trisectors''.&lt;ref name ="trisectors"&gt;{{Citation|last = Dudley|first = Underwood|author-link = Underwood Dudley|title = The trisectors|publisher = [[Mathematical Association of America]]|year = 1994|isbn = 0-88385-514-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approximation by successive bisections===
Trisection can be approximated by repetition of the compass and straightedge method for bisecting an angle. The geometric series 1/3 = [[1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + ⋯]] or 1/3 = 1/2-1/4+1/8-1/16+... can be used as a basis for the bisections. An approximation to any degree of accuracy can be obtained in a finite number of steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trisection of an Angle |author=Jim Loy |origyear=1997 |year=2003 |url=http://www.jimloy.com/geometry/trisect.htm |accessdate=30 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225124232/http://www.jimloy.com/geometry/trisect.htm |archivedate=February 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Using origami===
{{main|Mathematics of origami#Trisecting an angle}}
Trisection, like many constructions impossible by ruler and compass, can easily be accomplished by the more powerful operations of paper folding, or [[origami]].  [[Huzita's axioms]] (types of folding operations) can construct cubic extensions (cube roots) of given lengths, whereas ruler-and-compass can construct only quadratic extensions (square roots).

===Using a linkage===
There are a number of simple [[Linkage (mechanical)|linkages]] which can be used to make an instrument to trisect angles including Kempe's Trisector and Sylvester's Link Fan or Isoklinostat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Trisection Problem |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED058058.pdf#53 |first=Robert C| last=Yates |pp=39–42 |year=1942 |publisher=The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With a right triangle ruler ===
[[File:01-Dreiteilung-des-Winkels-Bieberbach.gif|thumb|510px|Trisection of the angle by means of the ''Rechtwinkelhaken'' according to Ludwig Bieberbach, with continuation of the construction, animation 1 min 35 s, of which break at the end 30 s.]]

In 1932, Ludwig Bieberbach published in ''Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik'' his work ''Zur Lehre von den kubischen Konstruktionen''.&lt;ref name="Ludwig Bieberbach"&gt;Ludwig Bieberbach (1932) ''Zur Lehre von den kubischen Konstruktionen, Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik,'' H. Hasse und L. Schlesinger, Band 167 Berlin, p. 142–146 [http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=PPN243919689_0167&amp;DMDID=DMDLOG_0020 online-copie (GDZ)]. Retrieved on June 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He states therein (free translation):

:"''As is known ... every cubic construction can be traced back to the trisection of the angle and to the multiplication of the cube, that is, the extraction of the third root. I need only to show how these two classical tasks can be solved by means of the right angle hook.''"

The following description of the adjacent construction (animation) contains their continuation up to the complete angle trisection.

It begins with the first [[unit circle]] around its center &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, the first angle limb &lt;math&gt;\overline{BP}&lt;/math&gt;, and the second unit circle around &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; following it. Now the diameter &lt;math&gt;\overline{BP}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is extended to the circle line of this unit circle, the intersection point &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; being created. Following the circle arc around &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; with the radius &lt;math&gt;\overline{BP}&lt;/math&gt; and the drawing of the second angle limb from the angle &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, the point &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; results. Now the so-called ''additional construction mean'' is used, in the illustrated example it is the ''[[Geodreieck]]''. This geometry triangle, as it is also called, is now placed on the drawing in the following manner: The vertex of the right angle determines the point &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; on the angle leg &lt;math&gt;\overline{PC}&lt;/math&gt;, a [[cathetus]] of the triangle passes through the point &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; and the other affects the unit circle &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. 
After connecting the point &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and drawing the tangent from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to the unit circle around &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, the above-mentioned ''right angle hook'' respectively ''Rechtwinkelhaken'' is shown. The angle enclosed by the segments &lt;math&gt;\overline{OS}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{PS}&lt;/math&gt; is thus exactly &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta}{3}&lt;/math&gt;. It goes on with the parallel to &lt;math&gt;\overline{OS}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, the [[alternate angle]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta}{3}&lt;/math&gt; and the point &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; are being created. A further parallel to &lt;math&gt;\overline{OS}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; determines the point of contact &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; from the tangent with the unit circle about &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.Finally, draw a straight line from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; until it intersects the unit circle in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the angle &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; has exactly three parts.

===With an auxiliary curve===
There are certain curves called [[trisectrix|trisectrices]] which, if drawn on the plane using other methods, can be used to trisect arbitrary angles.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Loy {{cite web|url=http://www.jimloy.com/geometry/trisect.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104113041/http://www.jimloy.com/geometry/trisect.htm |archivedate=November 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Application example====
[[File:01-Angel Trisection.svg|thumb|355px|Angle trisection (exact) with Maclaurin's trisectrix curve as additional auxiliary mean]]
The known [[Trisectrix of Maclaurin|Trisectrix of Colin Maclaurin]] from the year 1742 is used.

In [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] this curve is described with the equation
:&lt;math&gt;2x(x^2+y^2)=a(3x^2-y^2),&lt;/math&gt;

or, in [[Implicit curve|implicit form]], 
:&lt;math&gt;2x^3+2xy^2-a3x^2+ay^2=0. &lt;/math&gt;

====Angle trisection====

First, the diameter &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; with its center &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is determined.

===With a marked ruler===
[[Image:Three facts for trisecting angles.svg|right|355px|thumb|Basic triangle's angle properties]]
Another means to trisect an arbitrary angle by a "small" step outside the Greek framework is via a ruler with two marks a set distance apart. The next construction is originally due to [[Archimedes]], called a ''[[Neusis construction]]'', i.e., that uses tools other than an ''un-marked'' straightedge.  The diagrams we use show this construction for an acute angle, but it indeed works for any angle up to 180 degrees.

This requires three facts from geometry (at right):
# Any full set of angles on a straight line add to 180°,
# The sum of angles of any triangle is 180°, ''and'',
# Any two equal sides of an [[isosceles triangle]] will [[Pons asinorum|meet the third in the same angle]].

[[File:Trisecting angles three.svg|thumb|355px|Trisection of the angle using marked ruler]]

Let {{mvar|l}} be the horizontal line in the adjacent diagram.  Angle {{mvar|a}} (left of point {{mvar|B}}) is the subject of trisection. First, a point {{mvar|A}} is drawn at an angle's [[ray (geometry)|ray]], one unit apart from {{mvar|B}}. A circle of [[radius]] {{mvar|AB}} is drawn.  Then, the markedness of the ruler comes into play: one mark of the ruler is placed at {{mvar|A}} and the other at {{mvar|B}}.  While keeping the ruler (but not the mark) touching {{mvar|A}}, the ruler is slid and rotated until one mark is on the circle and the other is on the line {{mvar|l}}.   The mark on the circle is labeled {{mvar|C}} and the mark on the line is labeled {{mvar|D}}.  This ensures that {{math|''CD'' {{=}} ''AB''}}.  A radius {{mvar|BC}} is drawn to make it obvious that line segments {{mvar|AB}}, {{mvar|BC}}, and {{mvar|CD}} all have equal length.  Now, triangles {{mvar|ABC}} and {{mvar|BCD}} are [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]], thus (by Fact 3 above) each has two equal angles.

[[Hypothesis]]: Given {{mvar|AD}} is a straight line, and {{mvar|AB}}, {{mvar|BC}}, and {{mvar|CD}} all have equal length,

[[logical consequence|Conclusion]]: angle {{math|''b'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''a''|3}}}}.

[[Mathematical proof|Proof]]:
# From Fact 1) above, &lt;math&gt; e + c = 180&lt;/math&gt;°.
# Looking at triangle ''BCD'', from Fact 2) &lt;math&gt; e + 2b = 180&lt;/math&gt;°.
# From the last two equations, &lt;math&gt; c = 2b&lt;/math&gt;.
# From Fact 2), &lt;math&gt; d + 2c = 180&lt;/math&gt;°, thus &lt;math&gt; d = 180&lt;/math&gt;°&lt;math&gt; - 2c &lt;/math&gt;, so from last, &lt;math&gt; d = 180&lt;/math&gt;°&lt;math&gt; - 4b&lt;/math&gt;.
# From Fact 1) above, &lt;math&gt; a + d + b = 180&lt;/math&gt;°, thus &lt;math&gt; a + (180&lt;/math&gt;°&lt;math&gt; - 4b) + b = 180&lt;/math&gt;°.

Clearing, {{math|''a'' − 3''b'' {{=}} 0}}, or {{math|''a'' {{=}} 3''b''}}, and the [[theorem]] is [[Q.E.D.|proved]].

Again, this construction stepped outside the [[Greek mathematics|framework]] of [[compass and straightedge constructions|allowed constructions]] by using a marked straightedge.

===With a string===
Thomas Hutcheson published an article in the [[Mathematics Teacher]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Mathematics Teacher|volume=94 |issue=5 |date=May 2001 |pages=400–405 |last=Hutcheson |first=Thomas W. |title=Dividing Any Angle into Any Number of Equal Parts}}&lt;/ref&gt; that used a string instead of a compass and straight edge. A string can be used as either a straight edge (by stretching it) or a compass (by fixing one point and identifying another), but can also wrap around a cylinder, the key to Hutcheson's solution.

Hutcheson constructed a cylinder from the angle to be trisected by drawing an arc across the angle, completing it as a circle, and constructing from that circle a cylinder on which a, say, equilateral triangle was inscribed (a 360-degree angle divided in three).  This was then "mapped" onto the angle to be trisected, with a simple proof of similar triangles.

===With a "tomahawk"===
[[Image:TomahawkTrisecting.svg|thumb|right|A tomahawk trisecting an angle. The handle forms one trisector and the blue line shown forms the other.]]

A "[[Tomahawk (geometry)|tomahawk]]" is a geometric shape consisting of a semicircle and two orthogonal line segments, such that the length of the shorter segment is equal to the circle radius. Trisection is executed by leaning the end of the tomahawk's shorter segment on one ray, the circle's edge on the other, so that the "handle" (longer segment) crosses the angle's vertex; the trisection line runs between the vertex and the center of the semicircle.

Note that while a tomahawk is constructible with compass and straightedge, it is not generally possible to construct a tomahawk in any desired position.  Thus, the above construction does not contradict the nontrisectibility of angles with ruler and compass alone.

The tomahawk produces the same geometric effect as the paper-folding method: the distance between circle center and the tip of the shorter segment is twice the distance of the radius, which is guaranteed to contact the angle.  It is also equivalent to the use of an architects L-Ruler ([[Steel square#Carpenter's square|Carpenter's Square]]).

===With interconnected compasses===

An angle can be trisected with a device that is essentially a four-pronged version of a compass, with linkages between the prongs designed to keep the three angles between adjacent prongs equal.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac, Rufus, "Two mathematical papers without words", ''[[Mathematics Magazine]]'' 48, 1975, p. 198. Reprinted in ''Mathematics Magazine'' 78, April 2005, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of angle trisection==
[[File:01-Siebeneck-Tomahawk-Animation.gif|thumb|350px|

A [[cubic equation]] with real coefficients can be solved geometrically with compass, straightedge, and an angle trisector if and only if it has three [[real number|real]] [[root of a polynomial|roots]].&lt;ref name="Gleason"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gleason|first=Andrew Mattei|authorlink=Andrew M. Gleason|title=Angle trisection, the heptagon, and the triskaidecagon |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|date=March 1988|volume=95|issue=3 |pages=185–194|url=http://apollonius.math.nthu.edu.tw/d1/ne01/jyt/linkjstor/regular/1.pdf#3 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105205944/http://apollonius.math.nthu.edu.tw/d1/ne01/jyt/linkjstor/regular/7.pdf#3 |accessdate= |doi= 10.2307/2323624|archivedate=November 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Thm. 1}}

A [[regular polygon]] with ''n'' sides can be constructed with ruler, compass, and angle trisector if and only if &lt;math&gt;n=2^r3^sp_1p_2\cdots p_k,&lt;/math&gt; where ''r, s, k'' ≥ 0 and where the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are distinct primes greater than 3 of the form &lt;math&gt;2^t3^u +1&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. [[Pierpont prime]]s greater than 3).&lt;ref name="Gleason"/&gt;{{rp|Thm. 2}}

==Generalization==

For any nonzero integer {{mvar|N}}, an angle of measure {{math|{{frac|2{{pi}}|''N''}}}} radians can be divided into {{mvar|n}} equal parts with straightedge and compass if and only if {{mvar|n}} is either a power of {{math|2}} or is a power of {{math|2}} multiplied by the product of one or more distinct Fermat primes, none of which divides {{mvar|N}}. In the case of trisection ({{math|''n'' {{=}} 3}}, which is a Fermat prime), this condition becomes the above-mentioned requirement that {{mvar|N}} not be divisible by {{math|3}}.&lt;ref name=McLean/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9216">In [[geometry]], the '''Beckman&amp;ndash;Quarles theorem''', named after F. S. Beckman and D. A. Quarles, Jr., states that if a transformation of the [[Euclidean plane]] or a higher-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] preserves [[unit distance graph|unit distances]], then it preserves all distances. Equivalently, every [[graph automorphism|automorphism]] of the [[unit distance graph]] of the plane must be an [[isometry]] of the plane.
Beckman and Quarles published this result in 1953;&lt;ref name="bq53"&gt;{{citation

==Formal statement==
Formally, the result is as follows. Let {{mvar|f}} be a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] or [[multivalued function]] from a {{mvar|d}}-dimensional Euclidean space to itself, and suppose that, for every pair of points {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} that are at unit distance from each other, every pair of images {{math|''f''(''p'')}} and {{math|''f''(''q'')}} are also at unit distance from each other. Then {{mvar|f}} must be an [[isometry]]: it is a [[one-to-one function]] that preserves distances between all pairs of points.&lt;ref name="bq53"/&gt;

==Counterexamples for other spaces==
Beckman and Quarles observe that the theorem is not true for the [[real line]] (one-dimensional Euclidean space). For, the function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} that returns {{math|''x'' + 1}} if {{mvar|x}} is an integer and returns {{mvar|x}} otherwise obeys the preconditions of the theorem (it preserves unit distances) but is not an isometry.&lt;ref name="bq53"/&gt;

Beckman and Quarles also provide a counterexample for [[Hilbert space]], the space of square-summable sequences of real numbers. This example involves the [[function composition|composition]] of two [[continuous function|discontinuous functions]]: one that maps every point of the Hilbert space onto a nearby point in a  [[countable set|countable]] [[dense set|dense subspace]], and a second that maps this dense set into a countable unit [[simplex]] (an infinite set of points all at unit distance from each other). These two transformations map any two points at unit distance from each other to two different points in the dense subspace, and from there map them to two different points of the simplex, which are necessarily at unit distance apart. Therefore, their composition preserves unit distances. However, it is not an isometry, because it maps every pair of points, no matter their original distance, either to the same point or to a unit distance.&lt;ref name="bq53"/&gt;

==Related results==
For transformations only of the subset of Euclidean space with [[Cartesian coordinate]]s that are [[rational number]]s, the situation is more complicated than for the full Euclidean plane. In this case, there exist unit-distance-preserving non-isometries of dimensions up to four, but none for dimensions five and above.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

One way of rephrasing the Beckman–Quarles theorem is that, for the [[unit distance graph]] whose vertices are all of the points in the plane, with an edge between any two points at unit distance, the only [[graph automorphism]]s are the obvious ones coming from isometries of the plane. For pairs of points whose distance is an [[algebraic number]] {{mvar|A}}, there is a finite version of this theorem: Maehara showed that there is a finite [[Structural rigidity|rigid]] unit distance graph {{mvar|G}} in which some two vertices {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} must be at distance {{mvar|A}} from each other, from which it follows that any transformation of the plane that preserves the unit distances in {{mvar|G}} must also preserve the distance between {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Bellman's lost-in-a-forest problem''' is an unsolved minimization problem in [[geometry]], originating in 1955 by the American applied mathematician [[Richard E. Bellman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bellman | first1 = R. | authorlink = Richard E. Bellman | title =  Minimization problem | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | year = 1956 | journal = [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] | pages = 270 | department = Research problems | doi = 10.1090/S0002-9904-1956-10021-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The problem is often stated as follows: ''"A hiker is lost in a forest whose shape and dimensions are precisely known to him. What is the best path for him to follow to escape from the forest?"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Finch | first1 = S. R.| last2 = Wetzel | first2 = J. E.| title =  Lost in a forest | volume = 11 | year = 2004 | journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]] | pages = 645-654 | mr = 2091541 | doi = 10.2307/4145038}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually assumed that the hiker does not know the starting point or direction he is facing. The best path is taken to be the one that minimizes the worst-case distance to travel before reaching the edge of the forest. Other variations of the problem have been studied. 

A proven solution is only known for a few shapes or classes of shape. A general solution would be in the form of a geometric algorithm which takes the shape of the forest as input and returns the optimal escape path as the output. Although real world applications are not apparent, the problem falls into a class of geometric optimization problems including search strategies that are of practical importance. A bigger motivation for study has been the connection to [[Moser's worm problem]]. It was included in a list of 12 problems described by the mathematician [[Scott W. Williams]] as "million buck problems" because he believed that the techniques involved in their resolution will be worth at least a million dollars to mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = S.

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], the '''binomial distribution''' with parameters ''n'' and ''p'' is the [[discrete probability distribution]] of the number of successes in a sequence of ''n'' [[statistical independence|independent]] [[experiment (probability theory)|experiment]]s, each asking a [[yes–no question]], and each with its own [[boolean-valued function|boolean]]-valued [[outcome (probability)|outcome]]: a [[random variable]] containing a single [[bit]] of information: [[wikt:success|success]]/[[yes and no|yes]]/[[truth|true]]/[[one]] (with [[probability]] ''p'') or [[failure]]/no/[[false (logic)|false]]/[[zero]] (with [[probability]] ''q'' = 1 − ''p''). 
A single success/failure experiment is also called a [[Bernoulli trial]] or Bernoulli experiment and a sequence of outcomes is called a [[Bernoulli process]]; for a single trial, i.e., ''n'' = 1, the binomial distribution is a [[Bernoulli distribution]]. The binomial distribution is the basis for the popular [[binomial test]] of [[statistical significance]].

The binomial distribution is frequently used to model the number of successes in a sample of size ''n'' drawn [[Sampling (statistics)#Replacement of selected units|with replacement]] from a population of size ''N.'' If the sampling is carried out without replacement, the draws are not independent and so the resulting distribution is a [[hypergeometric distribution]], not a binomial one.  However, for ''N'' much larger than ''n'', the binomial distribution remains a good approximation, and is widely used.

==Specification==

===Probability mass function===

In general, if the random variable ''X'' follows the binomial distribution with parameters ''n'' ∈ ℕ and ''p'' ∈ [0,1], we write ''X''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;B(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p''). The probability of getting exactly ''k'' successes in ''n'' trials is given by the [[probability mass function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;f(k,n,p) = \Pr(k;n,p) = \Pr(X = k) = {n\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'', where

:&lt;math&gt;\binom n k =\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[binomial coefficient]], hence the name of the distribution. The formula can be understood as follows. ''k'' successes occur with probability ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''k'' failures occur with probability (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the ''k'' successes can occur anywhere among the ''n'' trials, and there are  &lt;math&gt;{n\choose k}&lt;/math&gt; different ways of distributing ''k'' successes in a sequence of ''n'' trials.

In creating reference tables for binomial distribution probability, usually the table is filled in up to ''n''/2 values. This is because for ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''/2, the probability can be calculated by its complement as

:&lt;math&gt;f(k,n,p)=f(n-k,n,1-p). &lt;/math&gt;

Looking at the expression ''ƒ''(''k'',&amp;nbsp;''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') as a function of ''k'', there is a ''k'' value that maximizes it. This ''k'' value can be found by calculating
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{f(k+1,n,p)}{f(k,n,p)}=\frac{(n-k)p}{(k+1)(1-p)} &lt;/math&gt;
and comparing it to 1. There is always an integer ''M'' that satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;(n+1)p-1 \leq M &lt; (n+1)p.&lt;/math&gt;

''ƒ''(''k'',&amp;nbsp;''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') is monotone increasing for ''k''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''M'' and monotone decreasing for ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''M'', with the exception of the case where (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''p'' is an integer. In this case, there are two values for which ''ƒ'' is maximal: (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''p'' and (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. ''M'' is the ''most probable'' (''most likely'') outcome of the Bernoulli trials and is called the [[Mode (statistics)|mode]]. Note that the probability of it occurring can be fairly small.

===Cumulative distribution function===

The [[cumulative distribution function]] can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;F(k;n,p) = \Pr(X \le k) = \sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor k \rfloor} {n\choose i}p^i(1-p)^{n-i}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \lfloor k\rfloor\,&lt;/math&gt; is the "floor" under ''k'', i.e. the [[greatest integer]] less than or equal to ''k''.

It can also be represented in terms of the [[regularized incomplete beta function]], as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wadsworth |first=G. P. |title=Introduction to Probability and Random Variables |year=1960 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York  |page=52 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNtQAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
F(k;n,p) &amp; = \Pr(X \le k) \\
&amp;= I_{1-p}(n-k, k+1) \\
&amp; = (n-k) {n \choose k} \int_0^{1-p} t^{n-k-1} (1-t)^k \, dt.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Some closed-form bounds for the cumulative distribution function are given [[#Tail bounds|below]].

==Example==

Suppose a [[fair coin|biased coin]] comes up heads with probability 0.3 when tossed. What is the probability of achieving 0, 1,..., 6 heads after six tosses?

: &lt;math&gt;\Pr(0\text{ heads}) = f(0) = \Pr(X = 0) = {6\choose 0}0.3^0 (1-0.3)^{6-0}= 0.117649&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Pr(1\text{ heads}) = f(1) = \Pr(X = 1) = {6\choose 1}0.3^1 (1-0.3)^{6-1}= 0.302526&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Pr(2\text{ heads}) = f(2) = \Pr(X = 2) = {6\choose 2}0.3^2 (1-0.3)^{6-2}= 0.324135&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Pr(3\text{ heads}) = f(3) = \Pr(X = 3) = {6\choose 3}0.3^3 (1-0.3)^{6-3}= 0.18522&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Pr(4\text{ heads}) = f(4) = \Pr(X = 4) = {6\choose 4}0.3^4 (1-0.3)^{6-4}= 0.059535&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Pr(5\text{ heads}) = f(5) = \Pr(X = 5) = {6\choose 5}0.3^5 (1-0.3)^{6-5}= 0.010206&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Pr(6\text{ heads}) = f(6) = \Pr(X = 6) = {6\choose 6}0.3^6 (1-0.3)^{6-6}= 0.000729&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Institute. [http://www.hamilton.ie/ollie/EE304/Binom.pdf "The Binomial Distribution"] October 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mean==

If ''X'' ~ ''B''(''n'', ''p''), that is, ''X'' is a binomially distributed random variable, n being the total number of experiments and p the probability of each experiment yielding a successful result, then the [[expected value]] of ''X'' is:&lt;ref&gt;See [https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Expectation_of_Binomial_Distribution Proof Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}[X] = np.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if ''n'' = 100, and ''p'' =&amp;nbsp;1/4, then the average number of successful results will be 25.

'''Proof:''' We calculate the mean, ''μ'', directly calculated from its definition

:&lt;math&gt;\mu=\sum_{i=0}^n x_i p_i,&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[binomial theorem]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \mu &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^n k\binom nk p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\\
                     &amp;= np\sum_{k=0}^n k\frac{(n-1)!}{(n-k)!k!}p^{k-1} (1-p)^{(n-1)-(k-1)}\\
                     &amp;= np\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{(n-1)!}{((n-1)-(k-1))!(k-1)!}p^{k-1} (1-p)^{(n-1)-(k-1)}\\
                     &amp;= np\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} p^{k-1} (1-p)^{(n-1)-(k-1)}\\
                     &amp;= np\sum_{\ell=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}\ell p^\ell (1-p)^{(n-1)-\ell} &amp;&amp; \text{with } \ell:=k-1\\
                     &amp;= np\sum_{\ell=0}^m \binom m\ell p^\ell (1-p)^{m-\ell} &amp;&amp; \text{with } m:=n-1\\
                     &amp;= np(p+(1-p))^m \\
                     &amp;=np
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It is also possible to deduce the mean from the equation &lt;math&gt;X=X_1+\cdots+X_n&lt;/math&gt; whereby all &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli distributed]] random variables with &lt;math&gt;E[X_i]=p&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;X_i=1&lt;/math&gt; if the ''i''th experiment succeeds and &lt;math&gt;X_i=0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise). We get:
&lt;math&gt;E[X] = E[X_1+\cdots+X_n] = E[X_1]+\cdots+E[X_n] = \underbrace{p+\cdots+p}_{n\text{ times}} = np&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- [As it stands the argument below is very badly written. I have expunged some utter nonsense from it, but what's left is not good.]
A different proof using calculus is shown below. This relies on defining a new function which only replaces one &lt;math&gt;p = q&lt;/math&gt;, and then plugging &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; back in at the end to recover the binomial distribution.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; \operatorname E[X]=A(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n i\binom ni (1-p)^{n-i}q^i\\[6pt]
&amp; \frac{A(q)}{q}=\sum_{i=0}^n i\binom ni (1-p)^{n-i}q^{i-1}\\[6pt]
&amp; \int \frac{A(q)}{q}dq=C + \sum_{i=0}^n \binom ni (1-p)^{n-i}q^i \\[6pt]
&amp; =(q+(1-p))^n + C\\[6pt]
&amp; \frac{d}{dq}\int\frac{A(q)}{q}dq=\frac{d}{dq}((q+(1-p))^n + C)\\[6pt]
&amp; \frac{A(q)}{q}=n(q+(1-p))^{n-1}\\[6pt]
&amp; q=p\\[6pt]
&amp; \frac{A(p)}{p}=n\\[6pt]
&amp; \operatorname E[X]=A(p)=np
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;

==Variance==
The [[variance]] is:
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var}(X) = np(1 - p).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:''' Let &lt;math&gt;X=X_1+\cdots+X_n&lt;/math&gt; where all &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; are independently Bernoulli distributed random variables. Since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X_i) = p(1-p)&lt;/math&gt;, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X)=\operatorname{Var}(X_1+\cdots+X_n)=\operatorname{Var}(X_1)+\cdots+\operatorname{Var}(X_n)=n \operatorname{Var}(X_1)=np(1-p).&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- [What appears below is at best very badly written. Maybe I'll return later to see if something of it can be salvaged.]
Another proof, in the same vein as the section on the Mean, can be done using calculus. Keep in mind that all the functions integrated below are zero at zero, but the binomial distribution is: &lt;math&gt;B(n,p)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;p=0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B(n,p)=1&lt;/math&gt;. By contrast, one can check that &lt;math&gt;B(q=0)=0 &lt;/math&gt; as defined below.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\operatorname{Var}(X)=\operatorname E[X^2]-(\operatorname E[X])^2=\operatorname E[X^2]-(np)^2\\
\operatorname E[X^2]=B(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n i^2\binom ni (1-p)^{n-i}q^i\\
\frac{B(q)}{q}=\sum_{i=0}^n i^2\binom ni (1-p)^{n-i}q^{i-1}\\
A(q)=\int_0^q \frac{B(q)}{q}dq=\sum_{i=0}^n i\binom ni (1-p)^{n-i}q^i \\
\frac{A(q)}{q}=\sum_{i=0}^n i\binom ni (1-p)^{n-i}q^{i-1}\\
\int_0^q \frac{A(q)}{q}dq=\sum_{i=0}^n \binom ni (1-p)^{n-i}q^i\\
\int_0^q \frac{A(q)}{q}dq=(q+(1-p))^n
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Now let's backtrack to &lt;math&gt;B(q)&lt;/math&gt;. We have to solve the following for &lt;math&gt;B(q)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_0^q \frac{1}{q}(\int_0^q \frac{B(q)}{q}dq)dq=(q+(1-p))^n\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We can just use the operation: &lt;math&gt;q\frac{d}{dq}q\frac{d}{dq}&lt;/math&gt;. This will undo all of the steps we have done.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
B(q)=q\frac{d}{dq}q\frac{d}{dq}((q+(1-p))^n)\\
=q\frac{d}{dq}(qn(q+(1-p))^{n-1})\\
=q(n(q+(1-p))^{n-1} + qn(n-1)(q+(1-p))^{n-2})\\
=qn(q+(1-p))^{n-1} + q^2n(n-1)(q+(1-p))^{n-2}\\
B(p)=pn+p^2n(n-1)\\
\operatorname{Var}(X)=B(p)-(np)^2\\
=pn+p^2n^2-np^2 -(np)^2\\
=pn-np^2\\
\operatorname{Var}(X)=np(1-p)\\

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;

==Mode==

Usually the [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of a binomial ''B''(''n'', ''p'') distribution is equal to &lt;math&gt;\lfloor (n+1)p\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;\lfloor\cdot\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is the [[floor function]]. However, when (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''p'' is an integer and ''p'' is neither 0 nor 1, then the distribution has two modes: (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''p'' and (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. When ''p'' is equal to 0 or 1, the mode will be 0 and ''n'' correspondingly. These cases can be summarized as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{mode} =
      \begin{cases}
        \lfloor (n+1)\,p\rfloor &amp; \text{if }(n+1)p\text{ is 0 or a noninteger}, \\
        (n+1)\,p\ \text{ and }\ (n+1)\,p - 1 &amp;\text{if }(n+1)p\in\{1,\dots,n\}, \\
        n &amp; \text{if }(n+1)p = n + 1.
      \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:''' Let

:&lt;math&gt;f(k)=\binom nk p^k q^{n-k}.&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;p=0&lt;/math&gt; only &lt;math&gt;f(0)&lt;/math&gt; has a nonzero value with &lt;math&gt;f(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;p=1&lt;/math&gt; we find &lt;math&gt;f(n)=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(k)=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k\neq n&lt;/math&gt;. This proves that the mode is 0 for &lt;math&gt;p=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;p=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; p &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. We find

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(k+1)}{f(k)} = \frac{(n-k)p}{(k+1)(1-p)}&lt;/math&gt;.

From this follows

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
k &gt; (n+1)p-1 \Rightarrow f(k+1) &lt; f(k) \\
k = (n+1)p-1 \Rightarrow f(k+1) = f(k) \\
k &lt; (n+1)p-1 \Rightarrow f(k+1) &gt; f(k)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So when &lt;math&gt;(n+1)p-1&lt;/math&gt; is an integer, then &lt;math&gt;(n+1)p-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(n+1)p&lt;/math&gt; is a mode. In the case that &lt;math&gt;(n+1)p-1\notin \Z&lt;/math&gt;, then only &lt;math&gt;\lfloor (n+1)p-1\rfloor+1=\lfloor (n+1)p\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is a mode.&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://math.stackexchange.com/a/117940/32951 the answer to the question "finding mode in Binomial distribution"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Median==
In general, there is no single formula to find the [[median]] for a binomial distribution, and it may even be non-unique. However several special results have been established:
* If ''np'' is an integer, then the mean, median, and mode coincide and equal ''np''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neumann|first=P.|year=1966|title=Über den Median der Binomial- and Poissonverteilung|journal=Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift der Technischen Universität Dresden|volume=19|pages=29–33|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Nick.

If ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2 and ''n'' is even, then ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''/2 is the unique median.

==Covariance between two binomials==

If two binomially distributed random variables ''X'' and ''Y'' are observed together, estimating their covariance can be useful. The [[covariance]] is

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) = \operatorname{E}(XY) - \mu_X \mu_Y.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 (the case of [[Bernoulli trial]]s) ''XY'' is non-zero only when both ''X'' and ''Y'' are one, and ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; are equal to the two probabilities. Defining ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; as the probability of both happening at the same time, this gives

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) = p_B - p_X p_Y,&lt;/math&gt;

and for ''n'' independent pairwise trials

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y)_n = n ( p_B - p_X p_Y ).&lt;/math&gt;

If ''X'' and ''Y'' are the same variable, this reduces to the variance formula given above.

==Related distributions==

===Sums of binomials===
If ''X''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;B(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') and ''Y''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;B(''m'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') are independent binomial variables with the same probability ''p'', then ''X''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''Y''  is again a binomial variable; its distribution is ''Z=X+Y''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;B(''n+m'',&amp;nbsp;''p''):

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \operatorname P(Z=k) &amp;= \sum_{i=0}^k\left[\binom{n}i p^i (1-p)^{n-i}\right]\left[\binom{m}{k-i} p^{k-i} (1-p)^{m-k+i}\right]\\
                       &amp;= \binom{n+m}k p^k (1-p)^{n+m-k}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

However, if ''X'' and ''Y'' do not have the same probability ''p'', then the variance of the sum will be [[Binomial sum variance inequality|smaller than the variance of a binomial variable]] distributed as &lt;math&gt;B(n+m, \bar{p}).\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Ratio of two binomial distributions===

This result was first derived by Katz et al. in 1978.&lt;ref name=Katz1978&gt;Katz D. ''et al''.(1978) Obtaining confidence intervals for the risk ratio in cohort studies. Biometrics 34:469–474&lt;/ref&gt;

Let p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be the probabilities of success in the binomial distributions B(X,n) and B(Y,m) respectively. Let T = (X/n)/(Y/m).

Then log(T) is approximately normally distributed with mean log(p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and variance ((1/p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) - 1)/n + ((1/p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) - 1)/m.

===Conditional binomials===
If ''X''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;B(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') and, conditional on ''X'', ''Y''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;B(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''q''), then ''Y'' is a simple binomial variable with distribution ''Y''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;B(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''pq'').

For example, imagine throwing ''n'' balls to a basket ''U&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' and taking the balls that hit and throwing them to another basket ''U&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''. If ''p'' is the probability to hit ''U&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' then ''X''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;B(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') is the number of balls that hit ''U&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''. If ''q'' is the probability to hit ''U&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'' then the number of balls that hit ''U&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''Y''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;B(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''q'') and therefore ''Y''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;B(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''pq'').

{{hidden begin|style=width:60%|ta1=center|border=1px #aaa solid|title=[Proof]}}
Since &lt;math&gt; X \sim B(n, p) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Y \sim B(X, q) &lt;/math&gt;, by the [[law of total probability]],
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Pr[Y = m] &amp;= \sum_{k = m}^{n} \Pr[Y = m \mid X = k] \Pr[X = k] \\[2pt]
&amp;= \sum_{k=m}^n \binom{n}{k} \binom{k}{m} p^k q^m (1-p)^{n-k} (1-q)^{k-m}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \binom{n}{k} \binom{k}{m} = \binom{n}{m} \binom{n-m}{k-m} &lt;/math&gt;, the equation above can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt; \Pr[Y = m] = \sum_{k=m}^{n} \binom{n}{m} \binom{n-m}{k-m} p^k q^m (1-p)^{n-k} (1-q)^{k-m} &lt;/math&gt;
Factoring &lt;math&gt; p^k = p^m p^{k-m} &lt;/math&gt; and pulling all the terms that don't depend on &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; out of the sum now yields
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\Pr[Y = m] &amp;= \binom{n}{m} p^m q^m \left( \sum_{k=m}^{n}  \binom{n-m}{k-m} p^{k-m} (1-p)^{n-k} (1-q)^{k-m} \right) \\[2pt]
&amp;= \binom{n}{m} (pq)^m \left( \sum_{k=m}^{n}  \binom{n-m}{k-m} \left(p(1-q)\right)^{k-m} (1-p)^{n-k}  \right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
After substituting &lt;math&gt; i = k - m &lt;/math&gt; in the expression above, we get
:&lt;math&gt; \Pr[Y = m] = \binom{n}{m} (pq)^m \left( \sum_{i=0}^{n-m} \binom{n-m}{i} (p - pq)^i (1-p)^{n-m - i} \right) &lt;/math&gt;
Notice that the sum (in the parentheses) above equals &lt;math&gt; (p - pq + 1 - p)^{n-m} &lt;/math&gt; by the [[binomial theorem]]. Substituting this in finally yields
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Pr[Y=m] &amp;=  \binom{n}{m} (pq)^m (p - pq + 1 - p)^{n-m}\\[4pt]
&amp;= \binom{n}{m} (pq)^m (1-pq)^{n-m}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
and thus &lt;math&gt; Y \sim B(n, pq) &lt;/math&gt; as desired.

===Bernoulli distribution===
The [[Bernoulli distribution]] is a special case of the binomial distribution, where ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. Symbolically, ''X''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;B(1,&amp;nbsp;''p'') has the same meaning as ''X''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;B(''p''). Conversely, any binomial distribution, B(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p''), is the distribution of the sum of ''n'' [[Bernoulli trials]], B(''p''), each with the same probability ''p''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taboga|first1=Marco|title=Lectures on Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics|url=https://www.statlect.com/probability-distributions/binomial-distribution#hid3|website=statlect.com|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poisson binomial distribution===
The binomial distribution is a special case of the [[Poisson binomial distribution]], or [[general binomial distribution]], which is the distribution of a sum of ''n'' independent non-identical [[Bernoulli trials]] B(''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'').&lt;ref&gt;

===Normal approximation===

[[File:Binomial Distribution.svg|right|250px|thumb|Binomial [[probability mass function]] and normal [[probability density function]] approximation for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 and ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.5]]

If ''n'' is large enough, then the skew of the distribution is not too great. In this case a reasonable approximation to B(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') is given by the [[normal distribution]]

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{N}(np,\,np(1-p)),&lt;/math&gt;

and this basic approximation can be improved in a simple way by using a suitable [[continuity correction]].
The basic approximation generally improves as ''n'' increases (at least 20) and is better when ''p'' is not near to 0 or 1.&lt;ref name="bhh"&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistics for experimenters|author=Box, Hunter and Hunter|publisher=Wiley|year=1978|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[Rule of thumb|rules of thumb]] may be used to decide whether ''n'' is large enough, and ''p'' is far enough from the extremes of zero or one:

*One rule&lt;ref name="bhh"/&gt; is that for {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 5}} the normal approximation is adequate if the absolute value of the skewness is strictly less than 1/3; that is, if
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{|1-2p|}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}=\frac1{\sqrt{n}}\left|\sqrt{\frac{1-p}p}-\sqrt{\frac{p}{1-p}}\,\right|&lt;\frac13.&lt;/math&gt;

*A stronger rule states that the normal approximation is appropriate only if everything within 3 standard deviations of its mean is within the range of possible values; that is, only if
::&lt;math&gt;\mu\pm3\sigma=np\pm3\sqrt{np(1-p)}\in(0,n).&lt;/math&gt;
:This 3-standard-deviation rule is equivalent to the following conditions, which also imply the first rule above.
::&lt;math&gt;n&gt;9\,\frac{1-p}p\quad\hbox{and}\quad n&gt;9\,\frac{p}{1-p}.&lt;/math&gt;
{{hidden begin|style=width:66%|ta1=center|border=1px #aaa solid|title=[Proof]}}
The rule &lt;math&gt; np\pm3\sqrt{np(1-p)}\in(0,n)&lt;/math&gt; is totally equivalent to request that
:&lt;math&gt;np-3\sqrt{np(1-p)}&gt;0\quad\hbox{and}\quad np+3\sqrt{np(1-p)}&lt;n.&lt;/math&gt;
Moving terms around yields:
:&lt;math&gt;np&gt;3\sqrt{np(1-p)}\quad\hbox{and}\quad n(1-p)&gt;3\sqrt{np(1-p)}.&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;0&lt;p&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, we can apply the square power and divide by the respective factors &lt;math&gt;np^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n(1-p)^2&lt;/math&gt;, to obtain the desired conditions:
:&lt;math&gt;n&gt;9\,\frac{1-p}p\quad\hbox{and}\quad n&gt;9\,\frac{p}{1-p}.&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that these conditions automatically imply that &lt;math&gt;n&gt;9&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, apply again the square root and divide by 3,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{n}}3&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1-p}p}&gt;0 \quad \hbox{and} \quad \frac{\sqrt{n}}3 &gt; \sqrt{\frac{p}{1-p}}&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;
Subtracting the second set of inequalities from the first one yields:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{n}}3&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1-p}p}-\sqrt{\frac{p}{1-p}}&gt;-\frac{\sqrt{n}}3;&lt;/math&gt;
and so, the desired first rule is satisfied,
:&lt;math&gt;\left|\sqrt{\frac{1-p}p}-\sqrt{\frac{p}{1-p}}\,\right|&lt;\frac{\sqrt{n}}3.&lt;/math&gt;
{{hidden end}}

*Another commonly used rule is that both values &lt;math&gt;np&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n(1-p)&lt;/math&gt; must be greater than or equal to&amp;nbsp;5. However, the specific number varies from source to source, and depends on how good an approximation one wants. In particular, if one uses&amp;nbsp;9 instead of&amp;nbsp;5, the rule implies the results stated in the previous paragraphs.
{{hidden begin|style=width:66%|ta1=center|border=1px #aaa solid|title=[Proof]}}
Assume that both values &lt;math&gt;np&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n(1-p)&lt;/math&gt; are greater than&amp;nbsp;9. Since &lt;math&gt;0&lt; p&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, we easily have that 
:&lt;math&gt;np\geq9&gt;9(1-p)\quad\hbox{and}\quad n(1-p)\geq9&gt;9p.&lt;/math&gt;
We only have to divide now by the respective factors &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1-p&lt;/math&gt;, to deduce the alternative form of the 3-standard-deviation rule:
:&lt;math&gt;n&gt;9\,\frac{1-p}p\quad\hbox{and}\quad n&gt;9\,\frac{p}{1-p}.&lt;/math&gt;
{{hidden end}}

The following is an example of applying a [[continuity correction]]. Suppose one wishes to calculate Pr(''X''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;8) for a binomial random variable ''X''. If ''Y'' has a distribution given by the normal approximation, then Pr(''X''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;8) is approximated by Pr(''Y''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;8.5). The addition of 0.5 is the continuity correction; the uncorrected normal approximation gives considerably less accurate results.

This approximation, known as [[de Moivre–Laplace theorem]], is a huge time-saver when undertaking calculations by hand (exact calculations with large ''n'' are very onerous); historically, it was the first use of the normal distribution, introduced in [[Abraham de Moivre]]'s book ''[[The Doctrine of Chances]]'' in 1738. Nowadays, it can be seen as a consequence of the [[central limit theorem]] since B(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') is a sum of ''n'' independent, identically distributed [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli variables]] with parameter&amp;nbsp;''p''. This fact is the basis of a [[hypothesis test]], a "proportion z-test", for the value of ''p'' using ''x/n'', the sample proportion and estimator of ''p'', in a [[common test statistics|common test statistic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[NIST]]/[[SEMATECH]], [http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section2/prc24.htm "7.2.4. Does the proportion of defectives meet requirements?"] ''e-Handbook of Statistical Methods.''&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, suppose one randomly samples ''n'' people out of a large population and ask them whether they agree with a certain statement. The proportion of people who agree will of course depend on the sample. If groups of ''n'' people were sampled repeatedly and truly randomly, the proportions would follow an approximate normal distribution with mean equal to the true proportion ''p'' of agreement in the population and with standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Poisson approximation===

The binomial distribution converges towards the [[Poisson distribution]] as the number of trials goes to infinity while the product ''np'' remains fixed or at least ''p'' tends to zero. Therefore, the Poisson distribution with parameter ''λ'' = ''np'' can be used as an approximation to B(''n'', ''p'') of the binomial distribution if ''n'' is sufficiently large and ''p'' is sufficiently small.  According to two rules of thumb, this approximation is good if ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;20 and ''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;0.05, or if ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;100 and ''np''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;ref name="nist"&gt;[[NIST]]/[[SEMATECH]], [http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section3/pmc331.htm "6.3.3.1. Counts Control Charts"], ''e-Handbook of Statistical Methods.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the accuracy of Poisson approximation, see Novak,&lt;ref&gt;Novak S.Y. (2011) Extreme value methods with applications to finance. London: CRC/ Chapman &amp; Hall/Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|9781-43983-5746}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ch. 4, and references therein.

===Limiting distributions===

* ''[[Poisson limit theorem]]'': As ''n'' approaches ∞ and ''p'' approaches 0 with the product ''np'' held fixed, the Binomial(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') distribution approaches the [[Poisson distribution]] with [[expected value]] ''λ = np''.&lt;ref name="nist"/&gt;
* ''[[de Moivre–Laplace theorem]]'': As ''n'' approaches ∞ while ''p'' remains fixed, the distribution of

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{X-np}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}&lt;/math&gt;

:approaches the [[normal distribution]] with expected value&amp;nbsp;0 and [[variance]]&amp;nbsp;1.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}  This result is sometimes loosely stated by saying that the distribution of ''X'' is [[Asymptotic normality|asymptotically normal]] with expected value&amp;nbsp;''np'' and [[variance]]&amp;nbsp;''np''(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p''). This result is a specific case of the [[central limit theorem]].

===Beta distribution===

[[Beta distribution]]s  provide a family of [[prior distribution|prior probability distribution]]s for binomial distributions in [[Bayesian inference]]:&lt;ref name=MacKay&gt;{{cite book| last=MacKay| first=David| title = Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms|year=2003| publisher=Cambridge University Press; First Edition |isbn=978-0521642989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confidence intervals==

{{main|Binomial proportion confidence interval}}

Even for quite large values of ''n'', the actual distribution of the mean is significantly nonnormal.&lt;ref name=Brown2001&gt;{{Citation |first1=Lawrence D. |last1=Brown |first2=T. Tony |last2=Cai |first3=Anirban |last3=DasGupta |year=2001 |title=Interval Estimation for a Binomial Proportion |url=http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~tcai/paper/html/Binomial-StatSci.html |journal=Statistical Science |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=101–133 |accessdate=2015-01-05 |doi=10.1214/ss/1009213286|citeseerx=10.1.1.323.7752 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this problem several methods to estimate confidence intervals have been proposed.

In the equations for confidence intervals below, the variables have the following meaning:

* ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of successes out of ''n'', the total number of trials
* &lt;math&gt; \hat{p} = \frac{n_1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the proportion of successes
* &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;1 - \tfrac{1}{2}\alpha&lt;/math&gt; [[quantile]] of a [[standard normal distribution]] (i.e., [[probit]]) corresponding to the target error rate &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. For example, for a 95% confidence level the error &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.05, so &lt;math&gt;1 - \tfrac{1}{2}\alpha&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.975 and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.96.

The notation in the formula below differs from the previous formulas in two respects:

* Firstly, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; has a slightly different interpretation in the formula below: it has its ordinary meaning of 'the ''x''th quantile of the standard normal distribution', rather than being a shorthand for 'the (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''x'')-th quantile'.
* Secondly, this formula does not use a plus-minus to define the two bounds. Instead, one may use &lt;math&gt;z = z_{\alpha / 2}&lt;/math&gt; to get the lower bound, or use &lt;math&gt;z = z_{1 - \alpha/2}&lt;/math&gt; to get the upper bound. For example: for a 95% confidence level the error &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.05, so one gets the lower bound by using &lt;math&gt;z = z_{\alpha/2} = z_{0.025} = - 1.96&lt;/math&gt;, and one gets the upper bound by using &lt;math&gt;z = z_{1 - \alpha/2} = z_{0.975} = 1.96&lt;/math&gt;.

The exact ([[Binomial proportion confidence interval#Clopper–Pearson interval|Clopper–Pearson]]) method is the most conservative.&lt;ref name=Brown2001/&gt;

The Wald method, although commonly recommended in textbooks, is the most biased.{{clarify|reason=what sense of bias is this|date=July 2012}}

==Generating binomial random variates==
Methods for [[random number generation]] where the [[marginal distribution]] is a binomial distribution are well-established.&lt;ref&gt;Devroye, Luc (1986) ''Non-Uniform Random Variate Generation'', New York: Springer-Verlag.

One way to generate random samples from a binomial distribution is to use an inversion algorithm. To do so, one must calculate the probability that P(X=k) for all values ''k'' from 0 through ''n''. (These probabilities should sum to a value close to one, in order to encompass the entire sample space.) Then by using a [[pseudorandom number generator]] to generate samples uniformly between 0 and 1, one can transform the calculated samples U[0,1] into discrete numbers by using the probabilities calculated in step one.

==Tail bounds==
For ''k'' ≤ ''np'', [[Chernoff bound|upper bounds]] for the lower tail of the distribution function can be derived.  Recall that &lt;math&gt;F(k;n,p) = \Pr(X \le k)&lt;/math&gt;, the probability that there are at most ''k'' successes.

[[Hoeffding's inequality]] yields the bound

:&lt;math&gt; F(k;n,p) \leq \exp\left(-2 \frac{(np-k)^2}{n}\right), \!&lt;/math&gt;

and [[Chernoff's inequality]] can be used to derive the bound

:&lt;math&gt; F(k;n,p) \leq \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\,p} \frac{(np-k)^2}{n}\right). \!&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, these bounds are reasonably tight when ''p'' = 1/2, since the following expression holds for all ''k'' ≥ 3''n''/8&lt;ref&gt;Matoušek, J, Vondrak, J: ''The Probabilistic Method'' (lecture notes) [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15859-f09/www/handouts/matousek-vondrak-prob-ln.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; F(k;n,\tfrac{1}{2}) \leq \frac{14}{15} \exp\left(- \frac{16 (\frac{n}{2} - k)^2}{n}\right). \!&lt;/math&gt;

However, the bounds do not work well for extreme values of ''p''. In particular, as ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; 1, value ''F''(''k'';''n'',''p'') goes to zero (for fixed ''k'', ''n'' with ''k''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n'')
while the upper bound above goes to a positive constant. In this case a better bound is given by
&lt;ref name="ag"&gt;R. Arratia and L. Gordon: ''Tutorial on large deviations for the binomial distribution'', Bulletin of Mathematical Biology 51(1) (1989), 125–131 [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02458840].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; F(k;n,p) \leq \exp\left(-nD\left(\frac{k}{n}\left|\right|p\right)\right) \quad\quad\mbox{if }0&lt;\frac{k}{n}&lt;p\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D''(''a'' || ''p'') is the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence|relative entropy]] between an ''a''-coin and a ''p''-coin (i.e. between the Bernoulli(''a'') and Bernoulli(''p'') distribution):

:&lt;math&gt; D(a||p)=(a)\log\frac{a}{p}+(1-a)\log\frac{1-a}{1-p}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

Asymptotically, this bound is reasonably tight; see
&lt;ref name="ag"/&gt; for details. An equivalent formulation of the bound is

:&lt;math&gt; \Pr(X \ge k) =F(n-k;n,1-p)\leq \exp\left(-nD\left(\frac{k}{n}\left|\right|p\right)\right) \quad\quad\mbox{if }p&lt;\frac{k}{n}&lt;1.\!&lt;/math&gt;
Both these bounds are derived directly from the [[Chernoff bound]].
It can also be shown that,

:&lt;math&gt; \Pr(X \ge k) =F(n-k;n,1-p)\geq \frac{1}{(n+1)^2} \exp\left(-nD\left(\frac{k}{n}\left|\right|p\right)\right) \quad\quad\mbox{if }p&lt;\frac{k}{n}&lt;1.\!&lt;/math&gt;

This is proved using the method of types (see for example chapter 12 of ''Elements of Information Theory'' by Cover and Thomas &lt;ref name="ct"&gt;Theorem 11.1.3 in {{cite book |page=350 |first=T. |last=Cover |first2=J. |last2=Thomas |title=Elements of Information Theory |edition=2nd |publisher=Wiley |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWq5GG6ycxMC&amp;pg=PA350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

We can also change the &lt;math&gt;(n+1)^2&lt;/math&gt; in the denominator to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, by approximating the binomial coefficient with Stirling's formula.&lt;ref name="ta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1548940/sharper-lower-bounds-for-binomial-chernoff-tails/1564088#1564088|title=Sharper Lower Bounds for Binomial/Chernoff Tails|website=math.stackexchange.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

This distribution was derived by [[James Bernoulli]]. He considered the case where ''p'' = ''r''/(''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''s'') where ''p'' is the probability of success and ''r'' and ''s'' are positive integers. [[Blaise Pascal]] had earlier considered the case where ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6050">In [[differential geometry]], the notion of a [[metric tensor]] can be extended to an arbitrary [[vector bundle]], and to some [[principal fiber bundle]]s. This metric is often called a '''bundle metric''', or '''fibre metric'''.

==Definition==
If ''M'' is a [[topological manifold]] and {{pi}}:''E'' → ''M'' a vector bundle on ''M'', then a metric on ''E'' is a [[bundle map]] ''k'' : ''E'' &amp;times;&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; ''E'' → ''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;'''R''' from the [[fiber product]] of ''E'' with itself to the [[trivial bundle]] with fiber '''R''' such that the restriction of ''k'' to each fibre over ''M'' is a [[nondegenerate]] [[bilinear map]] of [[vector spaces]].&lt;ref name=jost&gt;{{citation

==Properties==
Every vector bundle with paracompact base space can be equipped with a bundle metric.&lt;ref name=jost/&gt; For a vector bundle of rank ''n'', this follows from the [[local trivialization|bundle charts]] &lt;math&gt;\phi:\pi^{-1}(U)\to U\times\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;: the bundle metric can be taken as the pullback of the [[inner product]] of a metric on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;; for example, the orthonormal charts of Euclidean space. The [[structure group]] of such a metric is the [[orthogonal group]] ''O''(''n'').

==Example: Riemann metric==
If the manifold ''M'' is a [[Riemannian manifold]], and ''E'' is the [[tangent bundle]] T''M'', then the [[Riemannian metric]] gives a bundle metric, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=jost/&gt;

==Example: on vertical bundles==
If the bundle {{pi}}:''P'' → ''M'' is a [[principal fiber bundle]] with group ''G'', and ''G'' is a [[compact Lie group]], then there exists an Ad(''G'')-invariant inner product ''k'' on the fibers, taken from the inner product on the corresponding [[compact Lie algebra]]. More precisely, there is a [[metric tensor]] ''k'' defined on the [[vertical bundle]] E = V''P'' such that ''k'' is invariant under left-multiplication:

:&lt;math&gt;k(L_{g*}X, L_{g*}Y)=k(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;

for vertical vectors ''X'', ''Y'' and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; is left-multiplication by ''g'' along the fiber, and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''g*''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]].  That is, ''E'' is the vector bundle that consists of the vertical subspace of the tangent of the principal bundle.

More generally, whenever one has a compact group with [[Haar measure]] μ, and an arbitrary [[inner product]] ''h(X,Y)'' defined at the tangent space of some point in ''G'', one can define an invariant metric simply by averaging over the entire group, i.e. by defining

:&lt;math&gt;k(X,Y)=\int_G h(L_{g*} X, L_{g*} Y) d\mu_g&lt;/math&gt;

as the average.

The above notion can be extended to the [[associated bundle]] &lt;math&gt;P\times_G V&lt;/math&gt; where ''V'' is a vector space transforming covariantly under some [[Lie algebra representation|representation]] of ''G''.

==In relation to Kaluza–Klein theory==
If the base space ''M'' is also a [[metric space]], with metric ''g'', and the principal bundle is endowed with a [[connection form]] ω, then {{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;g+kω is a metric defined on the entire [[tangent bundle]] ''E'' = T''P''.&lt;ref name=bleecker&gt;David Bleecker, "[https://zulfahmed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/88623149-bleecker-d-gauge-theory-and-variational-principles-aw-1981-ka-t-201s-pqgf.pdf Gauge Theory and Variational Principles]" (1982) D. Reidel Publishing ''(See chapter 9'')&lt;/ref&gt;

More precisely, one writes {{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;g(''X'',''Y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''g''({{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;''X'', {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;''Y'') where {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] of the projection {{pi}}, and ''g'' is the [[metric tensor]] on the base space ''M''.  The expression ''kω'' should be understood as (''kω'')(''X'',''Y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''(''ω''(''X''),''ω''(''Y'')), with ''k'' the metric tensor on each fiber. Here, ''X'' and ''Y'' are elements of the [[tangent space]] T''P''.

Observe that the lift {{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;g vanishes on the [[vertical subspace]] T''V'' (since {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; vanishes on vertical vectors), while kω vanishes on the horizontal subspace T''H'' (since the horizontal subspace is defined as that part of the tangent space T''P'' on which the connection ω vanishes). Since the total tangent space of the bundle is a direct sum of the vertical and horizontal subspaces (that is, T''P'' = T''V''&amp;nbsp;⊕&amp;nbsp;T''H''), this metric is well-defined on the entire bundle.

This bundle metric underpins the generalized form of [[Kaluza–Klein theory]] due to several interesting properties that it possesses. The [[scalar curvature]] derived from this metric is constant on each fiber,&lt;ref name=bleecker/&gt; this follows from the Ad(''G'') invariance of the fiber metric ''k''.  The scalar curvature on the bundle can be decomposed into three distinct pieces:
:''R''&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') + ''L''(''g'', ω) + ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'')
where ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; is the scalar curvature on the bundle as a whole (obtained from the metric {{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;g+kω above), and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') is the scalar curvature on the base manifold ''M'' (the [[Lagrangian density]] of the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]]), and ''L''(''g'', ω) is the Lagrangian density for the [[Yang–Mills action]], and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'') is the scalar curvature on each fibre (obtained from the fiber metric ''k'', and constant, due to the Ad(''G'')-invariance of the metric ''k'').  The arguments denote that ''R''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') only depends on the metric ''g'' on the base manifold, but not ω or ''k'', and likewise, that ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'') only depends on ''k'', and not on ''g'' or ω, and so-on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7576">In [[mathematics]], the '''Cameron–Martin theorem''' or '''Cameron–Martin formula''' (named after [[Robert Horton Cameron]] and [[W. T. Martin]]) is a [[theorem]] of [[measure theory]] that describes how [[Abstract Wiener space|abstract Wiener measure]] changes under [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] by certain elements of the Cameron–Martin [[Hilbert space]].

==Motivation==
The standard [[Gaussian measure]] γ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; on ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is not translation-[[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]].  (In fact, there is a unique translation invariant Radon measure up to scale by [[Haar's theorem]]: the ''n''-dimensional [[Lebesgue measure]], denoted here ''dx''.)  Instead, a measurable subset ''A'' has Gaussian measure

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_n(A) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n/2}}\int_A \exp\left(-\tfrac12\langle x, x\rangle_{\mathbf R^n}\right)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\langle x,x\rangle_{\mathbf R^n}&lt;/math&gt; refers to the standard Euclidean [[dot product]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  The Gaussian measure of the translation of ''A'' by a vector ''h''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\gamma_n(A-h) &amp;= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n/2}}\int_A \exp\left(-\tfrac12\langle x-h, x-h\rangle_{\mathbf R^n}\right)\,dx\\[4pt]
&amp;=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n/2}}\int_A \exp\left(\frac{2\langle x, h\rangle_{\mathbf R^n} - \langle h, h\rangle_{\mathbf R^n}}{2}\right)\exp\left(-\tfrac12\langle x, x\rangle_{\mathbf R^n}\right)\,dx.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So under translation through ''h'', the Gaussian measure scales by the distribution function appearing in the last display:

:&lt;math&gt;\exp\left(\frac{2\langle x, h\rangle_{\mathbf R^n} - \langle h, h\rangle_{\mathbf R^n}}{2} \right)=\exp\left(\langle x, h\rangle_{\mathbf R^n} - \tfrac12\|h\|_{\mathbf R^n}^ 2\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The measure that associates to the set ''A'' the number &amp;gamma;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''&amp;minus;''h'') is the [[pushforward measure]], denoted (''T''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(γ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;).  Here ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt; : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; refers to the translation map:  ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''h''..  The above calculation shows that the [[Radon–Nikodym derivative]] of the pushforward measure with respect to the original Gaussian measure is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d} (T_h)_{*} (\gamma^n)}{\mathrm{d} \gamma^n} (x) = \exp \left( \left \langle h, x \right \rangle_{\mathbf{R}^n} - \tfrac{1}{2} \| h \|_{\mathbf{R}^n}^2 \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Abstract Wiener measure ''γ'' on a [[separable space|separable]] [[Banach space]] ''E'', where ''i''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''H''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''E'' is an abstract Wiener space, is also a "Gaussian measure" in a suitable sense. How does it change under translation? It turns out that a similar formula to the one above holds if we consider only translations by elements of the [[Dense set|dense]] [[linear subspace|subspace]] ''i''(''H'')&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''E''.

==Statement of the theorem==
Let ''i''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''H''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''E'' be an abstract Wiener space with abstract Wiener measure ''γ''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Borel(''E'')&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1]. For ''h''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''H'', define ''T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''E''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''E'' by ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''i''(''h''). Then (''T''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(γ) is [[Equivalence (measure theory)|equivalent]] to ''γ'' with Radon–Nikodym derivative

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d} (T_{h})_{*} (\gamma)}{\mathrm{d} \gamma} (x) = \exp \left( \langle h, x \rangle^{\sim} - \tfrac{1}{2} \| h \|_{H}^{2} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\langle h, x \rangle^{\sim} = I(h) (x)&lt;/math&gt;

denotes the [[Paley–Wiener integral]].

The Cameron–Martin formula is valid only for translations by elements of the dense subspace ''i''(''H'')&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''E'', called '''Cameron–Martin space''', and not by arbitrary elements of ''E''. If the Cameron–Martin formula did hold for arbitrary translations, it would contradict the following result:

:If ''E'' is a separable Banach space and ''&amp;mu;'' is a locally finite [[Borel measure]] on ''E'' that is equivalent to its own push forward under any translation, then either ''E'' has finite dimension or ''&amp;mu;'' is the [[trivial measure|trivial (zero) measure]]. (See [[quasi-invariant measure]].)

In fact, ''γ'' is quasi-invariant under translation by an element ''v'' [[if and only if]] ''v''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''i''(''H''). Vectors in ''i''(''H'') are sometimes known as '''Cameron–Martin directions'''.

==Integration by parts==
The Cameron–Martin formula gives rise to an [[integration by parts]] formula on ''E'': if ''F''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''E''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' has [[Bounded function|bounded]] [[Fréchet derivative]] D''F''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''E''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;Lin(''E'';&amp;nbsp;'''R''')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''E''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, integrating the Cameron–Martin formula with respect to Wiener measure on both sides gives

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{E} F(x + t i(h)) \, \mathrm{d} \gamma (x) = \int_{E} F(x) \exp \left( t \langle h, x \rangle^{\sim} - \tfrac{1}{2} t^2 \| h \|_{H}^{2} \right) \, \mathrm{d} \gamma (x)&lt;/math&gt;

for any ''t''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''. Formally differentiating with respect to ''t'' and evaluating at ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 gives the integration by parts formula

:&lt;math&gt;\int_E \mathrm{D} F(x) (i(h)) \, \mathrm{d} \gamma (x) = \int_E F(x) \langle h, x \rangle^\sim \, \mathrm{d} \gamma (x).&lt;/math&gt;

Comparison with the [[divergence theorem]] of [[vector calculus]] suggests

:&lt;math&gt;\mathop{\mathrm{div}} [V_h] (x) = - \langle h, x \rangle^\sim,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''E''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''E'' is the constant "[[vector field]]" ''V&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''i''(''h'') for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''E''. The wish to consider more general vector fields and to think of stochastic integrals as "divergences" leads to the study of [[stochastic processes]] and the [[Malliavin calculus]], and, in particular, the [[Clark–Ocone theorem]] and its associated integration by parts formula.

==An application==
Using Cameron–Martin theorem one may establish (See Liptser and Shiryayev 1977, p.&amp;nbsp;280) that for a ''q'' × ''q'' symmetric non-negative definite matrix, ''H''(''t'') whose elements ''H&lt;sub&gt;j,k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'') are continuous and satisfy the condition

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^1 \sum_{j,k=1} ^q |H_{j,k}(t)|\,dt &lt; \infty, &lt;/math&gt;

it holds for a ''q''−dimensional Wiener process ''w''(''t'') that

:&lt;math&gt; E \left[ \exp \left( -\int_0^1 w'(t)H(t)w(t) \, dt \right) \right] = \exp \left[ \tfrac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \operatorname{tr} (G(t)) \, dt \right], &lt;/math&gt;

where ''G''(''t'') is a ''q'' × ''q'' nonpositive definite matrix which is a unique solution of the matrix-valued [[Riccati differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dG(t)}{dt} = 2H(t)-G^2(t). &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3117">In [[mathematics education]] at [[primary school]] level, '''chunking''' (sometimes also called the '''partial quotients method''') is an elementary approach for solving simple [[division (mathematics)|division]] questions, by repeated [[subtraction]].  It is also known as the '''hangman method''' with the addition of a line separating the divisor, dividend, and partial quotients.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DaS1gYEYXs&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a counterpart in the [[grid method]] for multiplication.

To calculate the result of dividing a large number by a small number, the student repeatedly takes away "chunks" of the large number, where each "chunk" is an easy multiple (for example 100&amp;times;, 10&amp;times;, 5&amp;times; 2&amp;times;, etc.) of the small number, until the large number has been reduced to zero or the remainder is less than the divisor.  At the same time the student keeps a running total of what multiple of the small number has so far been taken away, which eventually becomes the final result of the sum.

So, for example, to calculate {{frac|132|8}}, one might successively subtract 80, 40 and 8 to leave 4,

       132
        80   (10 &amp;times; 8)
        --
        52
        40   ( 5 &amp;times; 8)
        --
        12
         8   ( 1 &amp;times; 8) 
        --
         4
             --------  
       132 =  16 &amp;times; 8 + 4

to establish that {{frac|132|8}} is 16 (10+5+1) with 4 remaining.

In the UK, this approach for elementary division sums has come into widespread classroom use in primary schools since the late 1990s, when the [[National Numeracy Strategy]] in its "numeracy hour" brought in a new emphasis on more free-form oral and mental strategies for calculations, rather than the rote learning of standard methods.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Eason, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/639937.stm Back to school for parents], ''BBC News'', 13 February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Compared to the [[short division]] and [[long division]] methods that are traditionally taught, chunking may seem strange, unsystematic, and arbitrary.  However, it is argued that chunking, rather than moving straight to short division, gives a better introduction to division, in part because the focus is always holistic, focusing throughout on the whole calculation and its meaning, rather than just rules for generating successive digits; and because its more free-form nature requires genuine understanding to be successful, rather than just the ability to follow a ritualised procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Campbell, Gavin Fairbairn, ''Working with support in the classroom'', SAGE, 2005; pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-v7jeLBjzTMC&amp;pg=PA59 59&amp;ndash;60] via Google books&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Escher Circle Limit III.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Circle Limit III'', 1959]]
'''''Circle Limit III''''' is a [[woodcut]] made in 1959 by Dutch artist [[M. C. Escher]], in which "strings of fish shoot up like rockets from infinitely far away" and then "fall back again whence they came".&lt;ref name="eq"&gt;Escher, as quoted by {{harvtxt|Coxeter|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of a series of four woodcuts by Escher depicting ideas from [[hyperbolic geometry]]. Dutch physicist and mathematician Bruno Ernst called it "the best of the four".&lt;ref name="cox79"&gt;{{citation|first=H. S. M.|last=Coxeter|authorlink=Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|title=The non-Euclidean symmetry of Escher's picture 'Circle Limit III'|journal=Leonardo|volume=12|pages=19–25|year=1979|jstor=1574078}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration==
[[File:Hyperbolic domains 642.png|left|thumb|upright=0.8|The (6,4,2) triangular hyperbolic tiling that inspired Escher]]
Escher became interested in [[tessellation|tessellations of the plane]] after a 1936 visit to the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]], Spain,&lt;ref name="emmer"&gt;{{citation

and from the time of his 1937 artwork ''[[Metamorphosis I]]'' he had begun incorporating tessellated human and animal figures into his artworks.&lt;ref name="mside"/&gt;

In a 1958 letter from Escher to [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H. S. M. Coxeter]], Escher wrote that he was inspired to make his ''Circle Limit'' series by a figure in Coxeter's article "Crystal 
Symmetry and its Generalizations".&lt;ref name="cox79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="emmer"/&gt; Coxeter's figure depicts a [[tessellation]] of the [[hyperbolic plane]] by [[right triangle]]s with angles of 30°, 45°, and 90°; triangles with these angles are possible in hyperbolic geometry but not in Euclidean geometry. This tessellation may be interpreted as depicting the lines of reflection and fundamental domains of the [[Truncated tetrahexagonal tiling|(6,4,2)]] [[triangle group]].&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter expanded on the mathematics of triangle group tessellations, including this one in {{citation

{{-}}

==Geometry==
[[File:Circle limits III with overlay.png|thumb|The [[alternated octagonal tiling]], a [[uniform tilings in hyperbolic plane|hyperbolic tiling]] of squares and equilateral triangles, overlaid on Escher's image]]
Escher seems to have believed that the white curves of his woodcut, which bisect the fish, represent hyperbolic lines in the [[Poincaré disk model]] of the hyperbolic plane, in which the whole hyperbolic plane is modeled as a disk in the Euclidean plane, and hyperbolic lines are modeled as circular arcs perpendicular to the disk boundary. Indeed, Escher wrote that the fish move "perpendicularly to the boundary".&lt;ref name="eq"/&gt; However, as Coxeter demonstrated, there is no hyperbolic [[arrangement of lines]] whose faces are alternately squares and equilateral triangles, as the figure depicts. Rather, the white curves are [[Hypercycle (geometry)|hypercycles]] that meet the boundary circle at angles of {{nowrap|cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; {{sfrac|2&lt;sup&gt;{{1/4}}&lt;/sup&gt; − 2&lt;sup&gt;−{{1/4}}&lt;/sup&gt;|2}},}} approximately&amp;nbsp;80°.&lt;ref name="cox79"/&gt;

The symmetry axes of the triangles and squares that lie between the white lines are true hyperbolic lines. The squares and triangles of the woodcut closely resemble the [[tritetragonal tiling]] of the hyperbolic plane, which also features squares and triangles meeting in the same incidence pattern.
However, the precise geometry of these shapes is not the same. In the tritetragonal tiling, the sides of the squares and triangles are hyperbolically straight line segments, which do not link up in smooth curves; instead they form [[polygonal chain]]s with corners. In Escher's woodcut, the sides of the squares and triangles are formed by arcs of hypercycles, which are not straight in hyperbolic geometry, but which connect smoothly to each other without corners.

The points at the centers of the squares, where four fish meet at their fins, form the vertices of an [[order-8 triangular tiling]], while the points where three fish fins meet and the points where three white lines cross together form the vertices of its [[Dual polyhedron|dual]], the [[octagonal tiling]].&lt;ref name="cox79"/&gt; Similar tessellations by lines of fish may be constructed for other hyperbolic tilings formed by [[polygon]]s other than triangles and squares, or with more than three white curves at each crossing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Douglas|last=Dunham|contribution=More “Circle Limit III” patterns|url=https://www.d.umn.edu/~ddunham/dunbrid06.pdf|title=The Bridges Conference: Mathematical Connections in Art, Music, and Science, London, 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Euclidean coordinates of circles containing the three most prominent white curves in the woodcut may be obtained by calculations in the field of rational numbers extended by the square roots of two and three.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=H. S. M.|last=Coxeter|authorlink=Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|contribution=The trigonometry of Escher’s woodcut ''Circle Limit III''|title=M.C.Escher’s Legacy: A Centennial Celebration|year=2003|publisher=Springer|pages=297–304|doi=10.1007/3-540-28849-X_29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symmetry==
Viewed as a pattern, ignoring the colors of the fish, in the hyperbolic plane, the woodcut has three-fold and four-fold [[rotational symmetry]] at the centers of its triangles and squares, respectively, and order-three [[dihedral symmetry]] (the symmetry of an equilateral triangle) at the points where the white curves cross. In [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]'s [[orbifold notation]], this set of symmetries is denoted 433. Each fish provides a fundamental region for this symmetry group. Contrary to appearances, the fish do not have [[bilateral symmetry]]: the white curves of the drawing are not axes of reflection symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Conway wrote that "The work ''Circle Limit III'' is equally intriguing" (in comparison to ''Circle Limit IV'', which has a different symmetry group), and uses is it as an example of this symmetry group.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Herford|title=The geometry of M. C. Escher's circle-Limit-Woodcuts|journal=Zentralblatt für Didaktik der Mathematik|year=1999|volume=31|issue=5|pages=144–148|doi=10.1007/BF02659805}}. Paper presented to the 8th International Conference on Geometry, Nahsholim (Israel), March 7–14, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, the angle at the back of the right fin is 90° (where four fins meet), but at the back of the much smaller left fin it is 120° (where three fins meet).

==Printing details==
The fish in ''Circle Limit III'' are depicted in four colors, allowing each string of fish to have a single color and each two adjacent fish to have different colors. Together with the black ink used to outline the fish, the overall woodcut has five colors. It is printed from five wood blocks, each of which provides one of the colors within a quarter of the disk, for a total of 20 impressions. The diameter of the outer circle, as printed, is {{cvt|41.5|cm|frac=8}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=M. C.

In mathematics, '''discrepancy theory''' describes the deviation of a situation from the state one would like it to be in. It is also called the ''theory of irregularities of distribution''. This refers to the theme of ''classical'' discrepancy theory, namely distributing points in some space such that they are evenly distributed with respect to some (mostly geometrically defined) subsets. The discrepancy (irregularity) measures how far a given distribution deviates from an ideal one.

Discrepancy theory can be described as the study of inevitable irregularities of distributions, in [[Measure theory|measure-theoretic]] and [[Combinatorics|combinatorial]] settings. Just as [[Ramsey theory]] elucidates the impossibility of total disorder, discrepancy theory studies the deviations from total uniformity.

A significant event in the history of discrepancy theory was the 1916 paper of [[H. Weyl|Weyl]] on the uniform distribution of sequences in the unit interval.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In [[affine space]], the union of a line and a point not on the line is ''not'' equidimensional. In general, if two closed subschemes of some scheme, neither containing the other, have unequal dimensions, then their union is not equidimensional.

If a scheme is [[Smooth scheme|smooth]] (for instance, [[Étale morphism|étale]]) over Spec&amp;nbsp;''k'' for some field&amp;nbsp;''k'', then every ''connected'' component (which is then in fact an irreducible component), is equidimensional.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2816">In [[computer science]], '''extended [[affix]] grammar'''s ('''EAGs''') are a [[formal grammar]] formalism for describing the [[Context-free grammar|context free]] and [[Context-sensitive grammar|context sensitive]] [[syntax]] of language, both [[natural language]] and [[programming language]]s.

EAGs are a member of the family of [[two-level grammar]]s; more specifically, a restriction of [[Van Wijngaarden grammar]]s with the specific purpose of making [[parsing]] feasible.

Like Van Wijngaarden grammars, EAGs have ''hyperrules'' that form a [[context-free grammar]] except in that their nonterminals may have arguments, known as ''affixes'', the possible values of which are supplied by another context-free grammar, the ''metarules''.

EAGs were introduced and studied by [[David Watt (computer scientist)|D.A. Watt]] in 1974; recognizers were developed at the University of Nijmegen between 1985 and 1995.  The EAG compiler developed there will generate either a recogniser, a transducer, a translator, or a syntax directed editor for a language described in the EAG formalism.  The formalism is quite similar to [[Prolog]], to the extent that it borrowed its [[cut (logic programming)|cut operator]].

EAGs have been used to write grammars of natural languages such as English, Spanish, and Hungarian.  The aim was to verify the grammars by making them parse corpora of text ([[corpus linguistics]]); hence, parsing had to be sufficiently practical.  However, the [[parse tree explosion]] problem that ambiguities in natural language tend to produce in this type of approach is worsened for EAGs because each choice of affix value may produce a separate parse, even when several different values are equivalent.  The remedy proposed was to switch to the much simpler Affix Grammar over a Finite Lattice ([[Affix grammar over a finite lattice|AGFL]]) instead, in which metagrammars can only produce simple finite languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.53.5264 ''Affix grammars for natural languages'', by C.H.A. Koster, in: ''Attribute Grammars, Applications and Systems, International Summer School SAGA'',1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''flatness''' (symbol: '''⏥''') of a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] is the degree to which it approximates a [[Plane (mathematics)|mathematical plane]]. The term is often generalized for higher-dimensional [[manifold]]s to describe the degree to which they approximate the [[Euclidean space]] of the same dimensionality. (See ''[[curvature]]''.)

'''Flatness''' in [[homological algebra]] and [[algebraic geometry]] means, of an object &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in an [[abelian category]], that &lt;math&gt;- \otimes A&lt;/math&gt; is an [[exact functor]].  See [[flat module]] or, for more generality, [[flat morphism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22144">In [[coding theory]], '''folded Reed–Solomon codes''' are like [[Reed–Solomon code]]s, which are obtained by mapping &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; Reed–Solomon codewords over a larger alphabet by careful bundling of codeword symbols.

Folded Reed–Solomon codes are also a special case of [[Parvaresh–Vardy code]]s.

Using optimal parameters one can decode  with a [[code rate|rate]] of ''R'', and achieve a decoding radius of 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''R''.

The term "folded Reed–Solomon codes" was coined in a paper by V.Y. Krachkovsky with an algorithm that presented Reed–Solomon codes with many random "phased burst" errors [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1246020&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D1246020 ]. The list-decoding algorithm for folded RS codes corrects beyond the &lt;math&gt;1-\sqrt{R} &lt;/math&gt; bound for Reed–Solomon codes achieved by the [[Venkatesan Guruswami|Guruswami]]–[[Madhu Sudan|Sudan]] algorithm for such phased burst errors.

==History==
One of the ongoing challenges in Coding Theory is to have error correcting codes achieve an optimal trade-off between (Coding) Rate and Error-Correction Radius. Though this may not be possible to achieve practically (due to Noisy Channel Coding Theory issues), quasi optimal tradeoffs can be achieved theoretically.

Prior to Folded Reed–Solomon codes being devised, the best Error-Correction Radius achieved was &lt;math&gt; 1- \sqrt{R} &lt;/math&gt;, by [[Reed–Solomon code]]s for all rates &lt;math&gt;R &lt;/math&gt;.

An improvement upon this &lt;math&gt; 1- \sqrt{R} &lt;/math&gt; bound was achieved by Parvaresh and Vardy for rates &lt;math&gt; R &lt;\tfrac{1}{16}.&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;R\to 0 &lt;/math&gt; the Parvaresh–Vardy algorithm can decode a fraction &lt;math&gt; 1- O(R \log(1/R))&lt;/math&gt; of errors.

Folded Reed–Solomon Codes improve on these previous constructions, and can be list decoded in polynomial time for a fraction &lt;math&gt; (1-R-\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; of errors for any constant &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition==

:&lt;math&gt;f(X)\mapsto\begin{bmatrix}f(1)\\f(\gamma)\\\vdots\\f(\gamma^{m-1})\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}f(\gamma^m)\\f(\gamma^{m+1})\\\vdots\\f(\gamma^{2m-1})\end{bmatrix},\ldots,\begin{bmatrix}f(\gamma^{n-m})\\f(\gamma^{n-m+1})\\\vdots\\f(\gamma^{n-1})\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Consider a Reed–Solomon &lt;math&gt; [n=q-1,k]_q&lt;/math&gt; code of length &lt;math&gt;n &lt;/math&gt; and  [[Dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]] &lt;math&gt;k &lt;/math&gt; and a folding parameter &lt;math&gt;m \ge 1 &lt;/math&gt;. Assume that &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt; n&lt;/math&gt;.

Mapping for Reed–Solomon codes like this:

:&lt;math&gt;f \mapsto \left \langle  f(1), f \left (\gamma^1 \right ), f \left (\gamma^2 \right ), \ldots , f \left (\gamma^{n-1} \right ) \right \rangle  &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma \in  \mathbb{F}_q &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Primitive element (finite field)|primitive element]] in

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q = \left\{ 0,1, \gamma, \gamma^2, \ldots ,\gamma^{n-1}\right\} &lt;/math&gt;.

The  &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; folded version of Reed Solomon code  &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, denoted  &lt;math&gt;FRS_{\mathbb{F},\gamma,m,k }&lt;/math&gt; is a code of block length &lt;math&gt;N = n/m&lt;/math&gt;  over &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{F}^m&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;FRS_{\mathbb{F},\gamma,m,k }&lt;/math&gt; are just &lt;math&gt;[q-1,k] &lt;/math&gt; Reed Solomon codes with &lt;math&gt;m &lt;/math&gt; consecutive symbols from RS codewords grouped together.

===Graphic description===
[[File:Folding of Reed-Solomon Code with folding parameter m=3.png|thumb|450px|Folding of Reed–Solomon code with folding parameter m=3]]

The above definition is made more clear by means of the diagram with &lt;math&gt;m=3&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m &lt;/math&gt; is the folding parameter.

The message is denoted by &lt;math&gt;f(X) &lt;/math&gt;, which when encoded using Reed–Solomon encoding, consists of values of &lt;math&gt;f &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots,x_{n-1} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x_i =\gamma^i &lt;/math&gt;.

Then bundling is performed in groups of 3 elements, to give a codeword of length &lt;math&gt; n/3&lt;/math&gt; over the alphabet &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q^3 &lt;/math&gt;.

Something to be observed here is that the folding operation demonstrated does not change the rate &lt;math&gt;R &lt;/math&gt; of the original Reed–Solomon code.

To prove this, consider a linear &lt;math&gt; [n, k, d]_q&lt;/math&gt; code, of length &lt;math&gt;n &lt;/math&gt;, [[Dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]] &lt;math&gt; k&lt;/math&gt; and [[Block code#The distance d|distance]] &lt;math&gt;d &lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; folding operation will make it a &lt;math&gt;\left[\tfrac{n}{m}, \tfrac{k}{m},\tfrac{d}{m}\right]_{q^m}&lt;/math&gt; code. By this, the [[Code rate|rate]] &lt;math&gt; R = \tfrac{n}{k} &lt;/math&gt; will be the same.

==Folded Reed–Solomon codes and the singleton bound==

According to the asymptotic version of the [[singleton bound]], it is known that the [[Block code#The distance d|relative distance]] &lt;math&gt; \delta  &lt;/math&gt;, of a code must satisfy &lt;math&gt;R \leqslant 1-\delta + o(1) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; R&lt;/math&gt;is the rate of the code.  As proved earlier, since the rate &lt;math&gt; R&lt;/math&gt; is maintained, the relative distance &lt;math&gt; \delta \geqslant  1-R &lt;/math&gt; also meets the Singleton bound.

===Why folding might help?===
[[File:Decoding a Folded Reed-Solomon Code.png|thumb|450px|Decoding a folded Reed–Solomon code]]

Folded Reed–Solomon codes are basically the same as Reed Solomon codes, just viewed over a larger alphabet. To show how this might help, consider a folded Reed–Solomon code with &lt;math&gt; m=3&lt;/math&gt;. Decoding a Reed–Solomon code and folded Reed–Solomon code from the same fraction of errors &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; are tasks of almost of the same computational intensity: one can '''unfold''' the received word of the folded Reed–Solomon code, treat it as an received word of the original Reed–Solomon code, and run the Reed–Solomon list decoding algorithm on it. Obviously, this list will contain all the folded Reed–Solomon codewords within distance &lt;math&gt;\rho &lt;/math&gt; of the received word, along with some extras, which we can expurgate.

Also, decoding a folded Reed–Solomon code is an easier task. Suppose we want to correct a third of errors. The decoding algorithm chosen must correct an error pattern that corrects every third symbol in the Reed–Solomon encoding. But after folding, this error pattern will corrupt all symbols over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q^3&lt;/math&gt; and will eliminate the need for error correction. This propagation of errors is indicated by the blue color in the graphical description.  This proves that the for a fixed fraction of errors &lt;math&gt;\rho,&lt;/math&gt; the folding operation reduces the channel's flexibility to distribute errors, which in turn leads to a reduction in the number of error patterns that need to be corrected.

==How folded Reed–Solomon (FRS) codes and Parvaresh Vardy (PV) codes are related==
We can relate Folded Reed Solomon codes with [https://wiki.cse.buffalo.edu/cse545/content/parvaresh-vardy-codes-and-list-decoder Parvaresh Vardy] codes which encodes a polynomial &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;  of degree &lt;math&gt; k&lt;/math&gt; with polynomials &lt;math&gt;f_0=f, f_1 , \ldots, f_{s-1} (s \geqslant 2)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f_i(X)=f_{i-1}(X)^d \mod E(X)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;E(X)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[irreducible polynomial]]. While choosing irreducible polynomial &lt;math&gt;E(X)=X^q -\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and parameter &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; we should check if every polynomial  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of degree at most &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma X)=f(X)^d \mod E(X)&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma X)&lt;/math&gt; is just the shifted counterpart of &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Primitive element (finite field)|primitive element]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q.&lt;/math&gt; Thus folded RS code with bundling together code symbols is PV code of order &lt;math&gt;s=m&lt;/math&gt; for the set of evaluation points

:&lt;math&gt;\left \{1, \gamma, \gamma ^ {2m},\ldots,\gamma^{\left (\frac{n}{m}-1 \right )m} \right \}&lt;/math&gt;.

If we compare the folded RS code  to a PV  code  of order 2 for the set of evaluation points

:&lt;math&gt; \left \{1, \gamma,\ldots, \gamma^{m-2},\gamma^m,\gamma^{m+1},\ldots,\gamma^{2m-2},\ldots,\gamma^{n-m},\gamma^{n-m+1},\ldots,\gamma^{n-2} \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

we can see that in PV encoding of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, for every &lt;math&gt;0 \leq i \leq n/m-1&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt; 0&lt;j&lt;m-1, f(\gamma^{mi+j})&lt;/math&gt; appears at &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma^{mi+j})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f_1(\gamma^{-1}\gamma^{mi+j})&lt;/math&gt;,

[[File:Codinh theory.png|thumb|600px|Relation between PV codes and FRS codes]]

unlike in the folded  FRS encoding in which it appears only once. Thus, the PV and folded RS codes  have same information but only the rate of FRS is bigger by a factor of &lt;math&gt;2(m-1)/m&lt;/math&gt; and hence the [[list decoding]] radius trade-off is better for folded RS code  by just using the list decodability of the PV codes. The plus point is in choosing FRS code in a way that they are compressed forms of suitable PV code with similar error correction performance with better rate than corresponding PV code. One can use this idea to construct a  folded RS codes of rate &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; that are list decodable up to radius approximately &lt;math&gt;1-R^{s/[s+1]}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;s\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;. 
[http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~atri/papers/coding/folded-RS.pdf ]

==Brief overview of list-decoding folded Reed–Solomon codes==
A [[list decoding]] algorithm which runs in quadratic time to decode FRS code up to radius &lt;math&gt;1-R-\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is presented by Guruswami. The algorithm essentially has three steps namely the interpolation step in which  welch berlekamp  style interpolation is used  to interpolate the non-zero polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;Q(X,Y_1,Y_2,\ldots,Y_s)=A_0(X) + A_1(X)Y_1 + A_2(X)Y_2 + \cdots + A_s(X)Y_s,&lt;/math&gt;

after which all the polynomials &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathbb{F}_q[X]&lt;/math&gt; with degree &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the equation derived in interpolation are found. In the third step the actual list of close-by codewords  are known by pruning the solution subspace which takes &lt;math&gt;q^s&lt;/math&gt;time.

==Linear-algebraic list decoding algorithm==
Guruswami presents a &lt;math&gt;n^{\Omega (1/\varepsilon^2)}&lt;/math&gt; time list decoding algorithm based on linear-algebra, which can decode folded Reed–Solomon code up to radius &lt;math&gt;1-R-\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; with a list-size of &lt;math&gt;{n^{O(1/\varepsilon^2)}}&lt;/math&gt;. There are three steps in this algorithm: Interpolation Step, Root Finding Step and Prune Step. In the Interpolation step it will try to find the candidate message polynomial &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; by solving a linear system. In the Root Finding step, it will try to find the solution subspace by solving another linear system. The last step will try to prune the solution subspace gained in the second step. We will introduce each step in details in the following.

===Step 1: The interpolation step===
It is a [[Berlekamp–Welch algorithm|Welch–Berlekamp-style]] interpolation (because it can be viewed as the higher-dimensional generalization of the Welch–Berlekamp algorithm). Suppose we received a codeword &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-folded Reed–Solomon code as shown below

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{bmatrix}y_0\\y_1\\y_2\\\cdots\\y_{m-1}\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}y_m\\y_{m+1}\\y_{m+2}\\\cdots\\y_{2m-1}\end{bmatrix},\cdots,\begin{bmatrix}y_{n-m}\\y_{n-m+1}\\y_{n-m+2}\\\cdots\\y_{n-1}\end{bmatrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

We interpolate the nonzero polynomial

: &lt;math&gt;Q(X,Y_1,\ldots,Y_s)=A_0(X) + A_1(X)Y_1 +  \cdots + A_s(X)Y_s, \qquad \begin{cases} \deg(A_i) \leqslant  D &amp; 1 \leqslant i \leqslant s \\ \deg(A_0) \leqslant D + k -1 &amp; \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

by using a carefully chosen degree parameter &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;D= \left \lfloor \frac{N(m-s+1)-k+1}{s+1} \right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

So the interpolation requirements will be

: &lt;math&gt;Q \left (\gamma^{im+j},y_{im+j},y_{im+j+1},\ldots,y_{im+j+s-1} \right )=0, \quad \text{for} \quad i=0,1,\ldots, \tfrac{n}{m} - 1, j=0,1,\ldots,m-s.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the number of monomials in &lt;math&gt;Q(X,Y_1,\ldots,Y_s)&lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;(D + 1)s + D + k = (D+1)(s+1) + k -1 &gt; N(m - s + 1)&lt;/math&gt;

Because the number of monomials in &lt;math&gt;Q(X,Y_1,\ldots,Y_s)&lt;/math&gt; is greater than the number of interpolation conditions. We have below lemma

:'''Lemma 1.''' &lt;math&gt;0 \neq Q \in \mathbb{F}_q[X,Y_1,\ldots,Y_s]&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the above interpolation condition can be found by solving a homogeneous linear system over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt; with at most &lt;math&gt;Nm&lt;/math&gt; constraints and variables. Moreover this interpolation can be performed in &lt;math&gt;O(Nm\log^2(Nm)\log\log(Nm))&lt;/math&gt; operations over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;For proof see Proposition 5.11 in Chapter 5 in Brander's thesis listed in the references.&lt;/ref&gt;

This lemma shows us that the interpolation step can be done in near-linear time.

For now, we have talked about everything we need for the multivariate polynomial &lt;math&gt;Q(X,Y_1,\ldots,Y_s)&lt;/math&gt;. The remaining task is to focus on the message polynomials &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''Lemma 2.''' If a candidate message polynomial &lt;math&gt;f(X) \in \mathbb{F}[X]&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial of degree at most &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt; whose Folded Reed-Solomon encoding agrees with the received word &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in at least &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; columns with 
::&lt;math&gt;t&gt;{{D+k-1}\over{m-s+1}},&lt;/math&gt;
:then  &lt;math&gt;Q(X,f(X),f(\gamma X),\ldots,f(\gamma_{s-1}X))=0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the details of the proof, please refer to Guruswami's paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here "agree" means that all the &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; values in a column should match the corresponding values in codeword &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

This lemma shows us that any such polynomial &lt;math&gt;Q(X,Y_1,\ldots,Y_s)&lt;/math&gt; presents an algebraic condition that must be satisfied for those message polynomials &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; that we are interested in list decoding.

Combining Lemma 2 and parameter &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;t(m-s+1)&gt;\frac{N(m-s+1)+s(k-1)}{s+1}&lt;/math&gt;

Further we can get the decoding bound

:&lt;math&gt;t\geqslant \frac{N}{s+1}+\frac{s}{s+1}\cdot\frac{k}{m-s+1}=N\left(\frac{1}{s+1}+\frac{s}{s+1}\cdot\frac{mR}{m-s+1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

We notice that the fractional agreement is

:&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{1}{s+1} + \dfrac{s}{s+1} \cdot \dfrac{mR}{m-s+1}&lt;/math&gt;

===Step 2: The root-finding step===

During this step, our task focus on how to find all polynomials &lt;math&gt;f\in{\mathbb{F}_q[X]}&lt;/math&gt; with degree no more than &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt; and satisfy the equation we get from Step 1, namely

:&lt;math&gt;A_0(X) + A_1(X)f(X) + A_2(X)f(\gamma X) + \cdots + A_s(X)f(\gamma^{s-1}X)=0&lt;/math&gt;

Since the above equation forms a linear system equations over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt; in the coefficients &lt;math&gt;f_0,f_1,\ldots,f_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; of the polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;f(X) = f_0 + f_1X + \cdots + f_{k-1}X^{k-1},&lt;/math&gt;

the solutions to the above equation is an [[affine subspace]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}^k_q&lt;/math&gt;. This fact is the key point that gives rise to an efficient algorithm - we can solve the linear system.

It is natural to ask how large is the dimension of the solution? Is there any upper bound on the dimension? Having an upper bound is very important in constructing an efficient list decoding algorithm because one can simply output all the codewords for any given decoding problem.

Actually it indeed has an upper bound as below lemma argues.

:'''Lemma 3.''' If the order of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is at least &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; (in particular when &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is primitive), then the dimension of the solution is at most &lt;math&gt;s-1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;For the details of the proof, please refer to Guruswami's paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

This lemma shows us the upper bound of the dimension for the solution space.

Finally, based on the above analysis, we have below theorem

:'''Theorem 1.''' For the folded Reed–Solomon code &lt;math&gt;FRS^{(m)}_q[n,k]&lt;/math&gt; of block length &lt;math&gt;N=\tfrac{n}{m}&lt;/math&gt; and rate &lt;math&gt;R=\tfrac{k}{n},&lt;/math&gt; the following holds for all integers &lt;math&gt;s, 1 \leqslant s \leqslant m&lt;/math&gt;. Given a received word &lt;math&gt;y \in (\mathbb{F}_q^m)^N&lt;/math&gt;, in &lt;math&gt;O((Nm\log q)^2)&lt;/math&gt; time, one can find a basis for a subspace of dimension at most &lt;math&gt;s-1&lt;/math&gt; that contains all message polynomials &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathbb{F}_q[X]&lt;/math&gt; of degree less than &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; whose FRS encoding differs from &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in at most a fraction 
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{s}{s+1}\left(1-\frac{mR}{m-s+1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:of the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; codeword positions.

When &lt;math&gt;s = m = 1&lt;/math&gt;,  we notice that this reduces to a unique decoding algorithm with up to a fraction &lt;math&gt;(1-R)/2&lt;/math&gt; of errors. In other words, we can treat unique decoding algorithm as a specialty of list decoding algorithm. The quantity is about &lt;math&gt;n^{O(1/\varepsilon)}&lt;/math&gt; for the parameter choices that achieve a list decoding radius of &lt;math&gt;1-R-\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

Theorem 1 tells us exactly how large the error radius would be.

Now we finally get the solution subspace. However, there is still one problem standing. The list size in the worst case is &lt;math&gt;n^{\Omega(1/\varepsilon)}&lt;/math&gt;. But the actual list of close-by codewords is only a small set within that subspace. So we need some process to prune the subspace to narrow it down. This prune process takes &lt;math&gt;q^s&lt;/math&gt; time in the worst case. Unfortunately it is not known how to improve the running time because we do not know how to improve the bound of the list size for folded Reed-Solomon code.

Things get better if we change the code by carefully choosing a subset of all possible degree &lt;math&gt;k -1&lt;/math&gt; polynomials as messages, the list size shows to be much smaller while only losing a little bit in the rate. We will talk about this briefly in next step.

===Step 3: The prune step===
By converting the problem of decoding a folded Reed–Solomon code into two linear systems, one linear system that is used for the interpolation step and another linear system to find the candidate solution subspace, the complexity of the decoding problem is successfully reduced to quadratic. However, in the worst case, the bound of list size of the output is pretty bad.

It was mentioned in Step 2 that if one carefully chooses only a subset of all possible degree &lt;math&gt;k -1&lt;/math&gt; polynomials as messages, the list size can be much reduced. Here we will expand our discussion.

To achieve this goal, the idea is to limit the coefficient vector &lt;math&gt;(f_0,f_1,\ldots,f_{k-1})&lt;/math&gt; to a special subset &lt;math&gt;\nu \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^k&lt;/math&gt;, which satisfies below two conditions:

:'''Condition 1.''' The set &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; must be large enough (&lt;math&gt;|\nu| \geq q^{(1-\varepsilon)k}&lt;/math&gt;).

This is to make sure that the rate will be at most reduced by factor of &lt;math&gt;(1-\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''Condition 2. ''' The set &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; should have low intersection with any subspace &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of dimension &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;S \subset \mathbb{F}_q^k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|S \cap \nu| \leqslant L.&lt;/math&gt; Such a subset is called  subspace-evasive subset.

The bound for the list size at worst case is &lt;math&gt;n^{\Omega(1/\varepsilon)}&lt;/math&gt;, and it can be reduced to a relative small bound &lt;math&gt;O(1/\varepsilon^2)&lt;/math&gt; by using subspace-evasive subsets.

During this step, as it has to check each element of the solution subspace that we get from Step 2, it takes &lt;math&gt;q^s&lt;/math&gt; time in the worst case (&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the dimension of the solution subspace).

Dvir and Lovett improved the result based on the work of Guruswami, which can reduce the list size to a constant.

Here is only presented the idea that is used to prune the solution subspace. For the details of the prune process, please refer to papers by Guruswami, Dvir and Lovett, which are listed in the reference.

===Summary===

If we don't consider the Step 3, this algorithm can run in quadratic time. A summary for this algorithm is listed below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2110">A '''free motion equation''' is a [[differential equation]] that describes a mechanical system in the absence of external forces, but in the presence only of an [[inertial force]] depending on the choice of a reference frame. 
In [[non-autonomous mechanics]] on a configuration space &lt;math&gt;Q\to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, a free motion equation is defined as a second order [[non-autonomous system (mathematics)| non-autonomous dynamic equation]] on &lt;math&gt;Q\to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; which is brought into the form 

: &lt;math&gt;\overline q^i_{tt}=0&lt;/math&gt;

with respect to some [[non-autonomous mechanics|reference frame]] &lt;math&gt;(t,\overline q^i)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;Q\to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. Given an arbitrary reference frame &lt;math&gt;(t,q^i)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;Q\to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, a free motion equation reads

The '''Garden of Archimedes''' (Italian: ''Il Giardino Di Archimede'') is a museum for mathematics in [[Florence, Italy]].  It was founded on March 26, 2004 and opened its doors to the public on April 14 of that year.  The mission of the museum is to enhance public understanding and perception of mathematics, to bring mathematics out of the shadows and into the limelight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turismo.intoscana.it/site/en/highlights/The-Garden-of-Archimedes/ The Garden of Archimedes A museum of mathematics in Florence] turismo.intoscana.it&lt;/ref&gt; It has been compared to the [[National Museum of Mathematics]] in New York City, the only museum in North America devoted to mathematics.&lt;ref name=&gt;''[http://php.math.unifi.it/archimede/archimede_NEW_inglese/presentazione2.html The Garden of Archimedes: A Museum for Mathematics: why, how and where]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Garden of Archimedes was set up in 2004 by a consortium of government and educational agencies. Current members of the consortium include: the [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]], the [[University of Florence]], the [[University of Pisa]], the [[University of Siena]], the [[Italian Mathematical Union]], the [[Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica Francesco Severi]], the Consortium for the Promotion of Culture of Research and Studies at the University of [[Avellino]]. The Consortium is based in Florence, at the Department of Mathematics "Ulisse Dini".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dimai.unifi.it/ Department of Mathematics and Computer 'Ulisse Dini' – University of Florence]&lt;/ref&gt; The President of the consortium is the mathematician [[Enrico Giusti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eosdev.it/Esperienze/GiardinoArchimede/ Il Giardino Di Archimede] EOS: IT solutions for the enterprise&lt;/ref&gt;

One initiative of the Garden of Archimedes is to create a history of Mathematics on [[CD-ROM]] and distribute it along with related supporting texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://php.math.unifi.it/archimede/archimede_NEW_inglese/CD_rom/primapagina.php A Garden of Archimedes initiative for the History of Mathematics: Historical Mathematics on CD-rom]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gifted''''' is a 2017 American [[drama film]] directed by [[Marc Webb]] and written by Tom Flynn. It stars [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Mckenna Grace]], [[Lindsay Duncan]], [[Jenny Slate]] and [[Octavia Spencer]]. The plot follows an [[intellectual giftedness|intellectually gifted]] 7-year-old who becomes the subject of a custody battle between her uncle and grandmother. The film was released on April 7, 2017, by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], and grossed $43 million worldwide.

==Plot==
In a small town near [[Tampa, Florida]], seven-year-old Mary Adler lives with uncle and ''[[de facto]]'' guardian, Frank. Her best friend is her 40-ish neighbor, Roberta. On her first day of first grade, she shows remarkable mathematical talent, which impresses her teacher, Bonnie Stevenson. There, despite her initial disdain for average children her own age and her boredom with their classwork, she begins to bond with them when she brings her one-eyed cat, Fred, for [[Show and tell (education)|show-and-tell]] and later defends a classmate from a bully on the bus. Mary is offered a scholarship to a private school for [[intellectual giftedness|gifted]] children. However, Frank turns it down. Based on his family's experiences with similar schools, he fears Mary will not have a chance at a "normal" childhood.

It emerges that Mary's mother, Diane, had been a promising mathematician, dedicated to the [[Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness|Navier–Stokes problem]] (one of the unsolved [[Millennium Prize Problems]]) before taking her own life when Mary was six months old. Mary has lived with Frank, a former college [[professor]] turned boat repairman, ever since.

Frank's estranged mother and Mary's maternal grandmother, Evelyn, seeks to gain custody of Mary and move her to [[Massachusetts]], believing that Mary is a "one-in-a-billion" mathematical prodigy who should be specially tutored in preparation for a life devoted to mathematics, much as Diane was. However, Frank is adamant that his sister would want Mary to be in a normal public school and have the childhood she didn't have. Worried that the judge will rule against him and he will lose Mary completely, Frank accepts a compromise brokered by his lawyer Greg Cullen that sees Mary placed in foster care and attend the private school where Evelyn wants to have her enrolled. The foster parents live just 25 minutes from Frank's home, Frank will be entitled to scheduled visits, and Mary will be able to decide where she wants to live after her 12th birthday.

Mary is devastated at being placed in foster care, and her foster father says she refuses to see Frank. When Bonnie sees a picture of Fred up for adoption, she alerts Frank. Frank retrieves the cat from the pound and, learning that Fred was brought in due to allergy issues, realizes that Evelyn—who is [[allergy|allergic]] to cats—is overseeing Mary's education in the guest house of Mary's foster home. He then reveals to Evelyn—who had been a mathematician herself—that Diane ''had'' solved the Navier–Stokes problem, but stipulated that the solution was to be withheld until Evelyn's death. Knowing that it meant everything to Evelyn to see Diane solve the problem, Frank offers Evelyn the opportunity to publish Diane's work if she drops her objection to his having custody of Mary. Evelyn reluctantly agrees.

The film ends with Mary back in the custody of Frank, returning to public school while taking college-level courses in the mornings.

The site's critical consensus reads, "''Gifted'' isn't quite as bright as its pint-sized protagonist, but a charming cast wrings respectably engaging drama out of a fairly predictable premise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gifted_2017/|title=Gifted (2017)|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gifted/details|title=Gifted reviews|work=Metacritic|accessdate=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=4285&amp;p=.htm |title='Fate of the Furious' Set to Repeat at #1 as Five New Releases Hit Theaters |author=[[Box Office Mojo]] |date=April 20, 2017 |accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colin Covert of the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' gave the film 3/4 stars, saying, "Sure, it's a simple, straightforward film, but sometimes that's all you need as long as its heart is true."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/gifted-oozes-empathy-after-the-storm-lacks-it-entirely/419398324/|title=Mini reviews: 'Gifted' oozes empathy; 'After the Storm' lacks it entirely|work=Star Tribune|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Roeper]] gave the film 4 out of 4 stars and said, "''Gifted'' isn't the best or most sophisticated or most original film of the year so far – but it just might be my favorite."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/young-math-whiz-gets-a-lesson-in-division-in-gripping-gifted/|title=Young math whiz gets a lesson in division in gripping 'Gifted'|work=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model form ==

The general case is a [[non-linear system|non-linear model]] with a partial theoretical structure and some unknown parts derived from data. Models with unlike theoretical structures need to be evaluated individually,&lt;ref name="Bohlin06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathworks13"&gt;Mathworks, 2013.

For a particular structure it is arbitrarily assumed that the data consists of sets of feed vectors '''f''', product vectors '''p''', and operating condition vectors '''c'''.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;  Typically '''c''' will contain values extracted from '''f''', as well as other values. In many cases a model can be converted to a function of the form:&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"&gt;Whiten, W.J., 1994.

: '''m(f,p,q)'''
where the vector function '''m''' gives the errors between the data '''p''', and the model predictions. The vector '''q''' gives some variable parameters that are the model's unknown parts.

The parameters '''q''' vary with the operating conditions '''c''' in a manner to be determined.&lt;ref name="Whiten13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"/&gt; This relation can be specified as '''q''' = '''Ac''' where '''A''' is a matrix of unknown coefficients, and '''c''' as in [[linear regression]]&lt;ref name="Draper98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisburg05"/&gt; includes a constant term and possibly transformed values of the original operating conditions to obtain non-linear relations&lt;ref name="Wikipolynomial"&gt;[[Polynomial]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wikispline"&gt;[[Spline (mathematics)]]&lt;/ref&gt; between the original operating conditions and '''q'''. It is then a matter of selecting which terms in '''A''' are non-zero and assigning their values. The model completion becomes an [[Mathematical optimization|optimisation]] problem to determine the non-zero values in '''A''' that minimizes the error terms '''m(f,p,Ac)''' over the data.&lt;ref name="Bohlin06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic94" &gt;Kojovic, T., and Whiten W.

== Model completion ==

Once a selection of non-zero values is made, the remaining coefficients in '''A''' can be determined by minimizing '''''m''(''f'',''p'',''Ac'')''' over the data with respect to the nonzero values in '''A''', typically by [[non-linear least squares]]. Selection of the nonzero terms can be done by optimization methods such as [[simulated annealing]] and [[evolutionary algorithms]]. Also the [[non-linear least squares]] can provide accuracy estimates&lt;ref name="Press07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash87" /&gt; for the elements of '''A''' that can be used to determine if they are significantly different from zero, thus providing a method of [[Model selection|term selection]].&lt;ref name="Linhart86"&gt;{{cite book|first=H. |last=Linhart|first2=W. |last2=Zucchini|title=Model selection|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=fzDm34Z8ctUC}}|year=1986|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-83722-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller02"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alan |last=Miller|title=Subset Selection in Regression|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=V-vLBQAAQBAJ}}|date=15 April 2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-3593-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes possible to calculate values of '''q''' for each data set, directly or by [[non-linear least squares]]. Then the more efficient [[linear regression]] can be used to predict '''q''' using '''c'''  thus selecting the non-zero values in '''A''' and estimating their values. Once the non-zero values are located [[non-linear least squares]] can be used on the original model '''m(f,p,Ac)''' to refine these values .&lt;ref name="Whiten71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic89"/&gt;

A third method is [[model inversion]],&lt;ref name="Whiten13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten14"/&gt; which converts the non-linear '''m'''('''f''','''p''','''Ac''') into an approximate linear form in the elements of '''A''', that can be examined using efficient term selection&lt;ref name="Linhart86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller02"/&gt; and evaluation of the linear regression.&lt;ref name="Lawson96"/&gt;  For the simple case of a single '''q''' value ('''q''' = '''a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c''') and an estimate '''q*''' of '''q'''. Putting d'''q'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c'''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;'''q*''' gives

: '''m(f,p,a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c) = m(f,p,q* + '''d'''q) ≈ m(f,p.q*) + '''d'''q m’(f,p,q*) = m(f,p.q*) + (a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c − q*) m’(f,p,q*)'''

so that '''a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is now in a linear position with all other terms known, and thus can be analyzed by [[linear regression]] techniques. For more than one parameter the method extends in a direct manner.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"/&gt; After checking that the model has been improved this process can be repeated until convergence. This approach has the advantages that it does not need the parameters '''q''' to be able to be determined from an individual data set and the linear regression is on the original error terms&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;

== Model validation ==

Where sufficient data is available, division of the data into a separate model construction set and one or two [[Cross-validation (statistics)|evaluation sets]] is recommended. This can be repeated using multiple selections of the construction set and the [[Bootstrap aggregating|resulting models averaged]] or used to evaluate prediction differences.

A statistical test such as [[Chi-squared distribution|chi-squared]] on the residuals is not particularly useful.&lt;ref name="Deming2000"&gt;{{cite book|first=William Edwards | last = Deming|title=Out of the Crisis p272|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=LA15eDlOPgoC |page=272}}|year=2000|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-54115-2| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chi squared test requires known standard deviations which are seldom available, and failed tests give no indication of how to improve the model&lt;ref name="Press07" /&gt;

An attempt to predict the residuals '''m(, )''' with the operating conditions '''c''' using linear regression will show if the residuals can be predicted.&lt;ref name="Kojovic94" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic89"/&gt; Residuals that cannot be predicted offer little prospect of improving the model using the current operating conditions.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt; Terms that do predict the residuals are prospective terms to incorporate into the model to improve its performance.&lt;ref name="Kojovic94" /&gt;

The model inversion technique above can be used as a method of determining whether a model can be improved. In this case selection of nonzero terms is not so important and linear prediction can be done using the significant [[eigenvectors]] of the [[Design matrix|regression matrix]]. The values in '''A''' determined in this manner need to be substituted into the nonlinear model to assess improvements in the model errors. The absence of a significant improvement indicates the available data is not able to improve the current model form using the defined parameters.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt; Extra parameters can be inserted into the model to make this test more comprehensive.

Another common question is concerned with the maximum distance into a desert which could be reached from a frontier settlement by an explorer capable of carrying provisions that would last him for ''a'' days." [[W. W. Rouse Ball]] and [[H.S.M. Coxeter]] (1987). ''Mathematical Recreations and Essays'', Thirteenth Edition, Dover, p32. {{ISBN|0-486-25357-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a mathematics problem in which a [[Willys MB|jeep]] must maximise the distance it can travel into a desert with a given quantity of fuel. The jeep can only carry a fixed and limited amount of fuel, but it can leave fuel and collect fuel at fuel dumps anywhere in the desert.

The problem was solved by [[Nathan Fine|N. J. Fine]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=wolfram/&gt;

==Problem==
There are ''n'' units of fuel stored at a fixed base. The jeep can carry at most 1 unit of fuel at any time, and can travel 1 unit of distance on 1 unit of fuel (the jeep's fuel consumption is assumed to be constant). At any point in a trip the jeep may leave any amount of fuel that it is carrying at a fuel dump, or may collect any amount of fuel that was left at a fuel dump on a previous trip, as long as its fuel load never exceeds 1 unit. There are two variants of the problem:

*'''Exploring the desert'''{{spaced ndash}} the jeep must return to the base at the end of every trip.
*'''Crossing the desert'''{{spaced ndash}} the jeep must return to the base at the end of every trip except for the final trip, when the jeep travels as far as it can before running out of fuel.

In either case the objective is to maximise the distance travelled by the jeep on its final trip. Alternatively, the objective may be to find the least amount of fuel required to produce a final trip of a given distance.

In the classic problem the fuel in the jeep and at fuel dumps is treated as a [[continuous function|continuous]] quantity. More complex variations on the problem have been proposed in which the fuel can only be left or collected in discrete amounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/rote/Papers/pdf/Optimal+logistics+for+expeditions+-+the+jeep+problem+with+complete+refilling.pdf Optimal Logistics for Expeditions: the Jeep Problem with Complete Refilling], Gunter Rote and Guochuan Zhang, June 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solution==
[[File:Jeep problem 1.png|thumb|250px|Solution to "exploring the desert" variant for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, showing fuel contents of jeep and fuel dumps at start of each trip and at turnround point on each trip.]]
A strategy that maximises the distance travelled on the final trip for the "exploring the desert" variant is as follows:

*The jeep makes ''n'' trips. On each trip it starts from base with 1 unit of fuel.
*On the first trip the jeep travels a distance of 1/(2''n'') units and leaves (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/''n'' units of fuel at a fuel dump. The jeep still has 1/(2''n'') units of fuel &amp;ndash; just enough to return to base.
*On each of the subsequent ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 trips the jeep collects 1/(2''n'') units of fuel from this first fuel dump on the way out, so that it leaves the fuel dump carrying 1 unit of fuel. It also collects 1/(2''n'') units of fuel from this first fuel dump on the way back, which is just enough fuel to return to base.
*On the second trip the jeep travels to the first fuel dump and refuels. It then travels a distance of 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2) units and leaves (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2)/(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) units of fuel at a second fuel dump. The jeep still has 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2) units of fuel, which is just enough to return to the first fuel dump. Here it collects 1/(2''n'') units of fuel, which is just enough fuel to return to base.
*On each of the subsequent ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 trips the jeep collects 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2) units of fuel from this second fuel dump on the way out, so that it leaves the fuel dump carrying 1 unit of fuel. It also collects 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2) units of fuel from the second fuel dump on the way back, which is just enough fuel to return to the first fuel dump.
*The jeep continues in this way, so that on trip ''k'' it establishes a new ''k''th fuel dump at a distance of 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2) units from the previous fuel dump and leaves (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'')/(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) units of fuel there. On each of the subsequent ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'' trips it collects 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2) units of fuel from the ''k''th dump on its way out and another 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2) units of fuel on its way back.

When the jeep starts its final trip, there are ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 fuel dumps. The farthest contains 1/2 of a unit of fuel, the next farthest contain 1/3 of a unit of fuel, and so on, and the nearest fuel dump has just 1/''n'' units of fuel left. Together with 1 unit of fuel with which it starts from base, this means that the jeep can travel a total round trip distance of

:&lt;math&gt;1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n} = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}&lt;/math&gt;

units on its final trip (the maximum distance travelled into the desert is half of this).&lt;ref name=coxeter/&gt; It collects half of the remaining fuel at each dump on the way out, which fills its tank. After leaving the farthest fuel dump it travels 1/2 a unit further into the desert and then returns to the farthest fuel dump. It collects the remaining fuel from each fuel dump on the way back, which is just enough to reach the next fuel dump or, in the final step, to return to base.

[[File:Jeep problem 2.png|thumb|250px|Solution to "crossing the desert" variant for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, showing fuel contents of jeep and fuel dumps at start of each trip, at turnround point on first two trips, and at end of final trip.]]
The distance travelled on the last trip is the ''n''th [[harmonic number]], ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. As the harmonic numbers are unbounded, it is possible to exceed any given distance on the final trip, as along as sufficient fuel is available at the base. However, the amount of fuel required and the number of fuel dumps both increase exponentially with the distance to be travelled.

The "crossing the desert" variant can be solved with a similar strategy, except that there is now no requirement to collect fuel on the way back on the final trip. So on trip ''k'' the jeep establishes a new ''k''th fuel dump at a distance of 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) units from the previous fuel dump and leaves (2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) units of fuel there. On each of the next ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 trips it collects 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) units of fuel from the ''k''th dump on its way out and another 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) units of fuel on its way back.

Now when the jeep starts its final trip, there are ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 fuel dumps. The farthest contains 1/3 of a unit of fuel, the next farthest contain 1/5 of a unit of fuel, and so on, and the nearest fuel dump has just 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) units of fuel left. Together with 1 unit of fuel with which it starts from base, this means that the jeep can travel a total distance of

:&lt;math&gt;1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2n-1} = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{2k-1}=H_{2n-1}-\frac{1}{2}H_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

units on its final trip.&lt;ref name=wolfram/&gt;&lt;ref name=coxeter/&gt; It collects all of the remaining fuel at each dump on the way out, which fills its tank. After leaving the farthest fuel dump it travels a further distance of 1&amp;nbsp;unit.

Note that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{2k-1} &gt; \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{2k} = \frac{1}{2}H_{n}&lt;/math&gt;

so it is possible in theory to cross a desert of any size given enough fuel at the base. As before, the amount of fuel required and the number of fuel dumps both increase exponentially with the distance to be travelled.

==Practical applications==
The problem can have a practical application in wartime situations, especially with respect to fuel efficiency. In the context of the bombing of Japan in [[World War II]] by [[B-29]]s, [[Robert McNamara]] says in the film ''[[The Fog of War]]'' that understanding the fuel efficiency issue caused by having to transport the fuel to forward bases was the main reason why the strategy of launching bombing raids from mainland China was abandoned in favor of the [[island hopping]] strategy:

{{quote|"We had to fly those planes from the bases in Kansas to India. Then we had to fly fuel over the hump into China. [...] We were supposed to take these [[B-29]]s—there were no [[tanker aircraft]] there. We were to fill them with fuel, fly from [[India]] to [[Chengdu|Chengtu]]; offload the fuel; fly back to India; make enough missions to build up fuel in Chengtu; fly to [[Yawata]], [[Japan]]; bomb the [[steel mills]]; and go back to India.

We had so little training on this problem of maximizing [fuel] efficiency, we actually found to get some of the B-29s back instead of offloading fuel, they had to take it on. To make a long story short, it wasn't worth a damn. And it was [[Curtis LeMay|LeMay]] who really came to that conclusion, and led the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff|Chiefs]] to move the whole thing to the [[Marianas]], which devastated Japan."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.errolmorris.com/film/fow_transcript.html Fog of War transcript], www.errolmorris.com&lt;/ref&gt;}}

(The [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing missions]] at the end of World War II were flown using B-29 [[Superfortresses]] from the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] island of [[Tinian]] in the [[Northern Marianas Islands]].)

See also [[Operation Black Buck]] for an application of these ideas. In these missions, conducted during the [[Falklands War]], the [[Royal Air Force]] used air to air refuelling by staging tankers to enable the [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcan]] bombers based on [[Ascension Island]] to bomb targets in the [[Falkland Islands]].

In [[coding theory]], '''Justesen codes''' form a class of [[Error detection and correction|error-correcting codes]] that have a constant rate, constant relative distance, and a constant alphabet size.

Before the Justesen error correction code was discovered, no error correction code was known that had all of these three parameters as a constant.

Subsequently, other ECC codes with this property have been discovered, for example [[expander code]]s.
These codes have important applications in [[computer science]] such as in the construction of [[small-bias sample space]]s.

Justesen codes are derived as the [[Concatenated error correction code|code concatenation]] of a [[Reed–Solomon error correction|Reed–Solomon code]] and the [[Wozencraft ensemble]].

The Reed–Solomon codes used achieve constant rate and constant relative distance at the expense of an alphabet size that is ''linear'' in the message length.

The [[Wozencraft ensemble]] is a family of codes that achieve constant rate and constant alphabet size, but the relative distance is only constant for most of the codes in the family.

The concatenation of the two codes first encodes the message using the Reed–Solomon code, and then encodes each symbol of the codeword further using a code from the [[Wozencraft ensemble]] – using a different code of the ensemble at each position of the codeword.

This is different from usual code concatenation where the inner codes are the same for each position. The Justesen code can be constructed very efficiently using only [[logarithmic space]].

==Definition==

Justesen code is [[Concatenated error correction code|concatenation code]] with different linear inner codes, which is composed of an &lt;math&gt;(N,K,D)_{q^k}&lt;/math&gt; outer code &lt;math&gt;C_{out}&lt;/math&gt; and different &lt;math&gt;(n,k,d)_q&lt;/math&gt; inner codes &lt;math&gt;C_{in}^i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1 \le i \le N&lt;/math&gt;. 

More precisely, the concatenation of these codes, denoted by &lt;math&gt;C_{out}  \circ (C_{in}^1 ,...,C_{in}^N )&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as follows. Given a message &lt;math&gt;m \in [q^k]^K&lt;/math&gt;, we compute the codeword produced by an outer code &lt;math&gt;C_{out}&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;C_{out}(m) = (c_1,c_2,..,c_N)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Then we apply each code of N linear inner codes to each coordinate of that codeword to produce the final codeword; that is, &lt;math&gt;C_{out} \circ (C_{in}^1,..,C_{in}^N)(m) = (C_{in}^1(c_1),C_{in}^2(c_2),..,C_{in}^N(c_N))&lt;/math&gt;. 

Look back to the definition of the outer code and linear inner codes, this definition of the Justesen code makes sense because the codeword of the outer code is a vector with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; elements, and we have &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; linear inner codes to apply for those &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; elements.

Here for the Justesen code, the outer code &lt;math&gt;C_{out}&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be [[Reed–Solomon error correction|Reed Solomon code]] over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{q^k}&lt;/math&gt; evaluated over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{q^k}-\{ 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; of [[Code rate|rate]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; &lt; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; &lt; &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. 

The outer code &lt;math&gt;C_{out}&lt;/math&gt; have the relative distance &lt;math&gt;\delta_{out} = 1 - R&lt;/math&gt; and block length of &lt;math&gt;N = q^k-1&lt;/math&gt;. The set of inner codes is the [[Wozencraft ensemble]] &lt;math&gt;\{ C_{in}^\alpha  \} _{\alpha  \in \mathbb{F}_{q^k }^* }&lt;/math&gt;.

==Property of Justesen code==

As the linear codes in the Wonzencraft ensemble have the rate &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, Justesen code is the concatenated code &lt;math&gt;C^* = C_{out} \circ (C_{in}^1,C_{in}^2,..,C_{in}^N)&lt;/math&gt; with the rate &lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. We have the following theorem that estimates the distance of the concatenated code &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;.

==Theorem==

Let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; has relative distance of at least &lt;math&gt;(1-R-\varepsilon)H_q^{-1} \left (\tfrac{1}{2}-\varepsilon \right).&lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===

In order to prove a lower bound for the distance of a code &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; we prove that the Hamming distance of an arbitrary but distinct pair of codewords has a lower bound. So let &lt;math&gt;\Delta(c^1,c^2)&lt;/math&gt; be the Hamming distance of two codewords &lt;math&gt;c^1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c^2&lt;/math&gt;. For any given

:&lt;math&gt;m_1 \neq m_2 \in \left (\mathbb{F}_{q^k} \right )^K, &lt;/math&gt;

we want a lower bound for &lt;math&gt;\Delta(C^*(m_1),C^*(m_2)).&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that if &lt;math&gt;C_{out}(m) = (c_1,\cdots,c_N)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;C^*(m) = (C_{in}^1(c_1),\cdots,C_{in}^N(c_N))&lt;/math&gt;. So for the lower bound &lt;math&gt;\Delta(C^*(m_1),C^*(m_2))&lt;/math&gt;, we need to take into account the distance of &lt;math&gt;C_{in}^1, \cdots, C_{in}^N.&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
C_{out}(m_1) &amp;= \left (c_1^1,\cdots,c_N^1 \right ) \\
C_{out}(m_2) &amp;= \left  (c_1^2,\cdots,c_N^2 \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Recall that &lt;math&gt;\left \{ C_{in}^1, \cdots, C_{in}^N \right \}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Wozencraft ensemble]]. Due to "Wonzencraft ensemble theorem", there are at least &lt;math&gt;(1-\varepsilon) N&lt;/math&gt; linear codes &lt;math&gt;C_{in}^i&lt;/math&gt; that have distance &lt;math&gt;H_q^{-1} \left (\tfrac{1}{2}-\varepsilon \right ) \cdot 2k.&lt;/math&gt; So if for some &lt;math&gt;1 \leqslant i \leqslant N, c_i^1 \ne c_i^2&lt;/math&gt; and the code &lt;math&gt;C_{in}^i&lt;/math&gt; has distance &lt;math&gt;\geqslant H_q^{-1} \left (\tfrac{1}{2}-\varepsilon \right) \cdot 2k,&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \left (C_{in}^i \left (c_i^1 \right), C_{in}^i \left (c_i^2 \right ) \right ) \geqslant H_q^{-1} \left (\tfrac{1}{2}-\varepsilon \right ) \cdot 2k.&lt;/math&gt;

Further, if we have &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; numbers &lt;math&gt;1 \leqslant i \leqslant N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;c_i^1 \ne c_i^2&lt;/math&gt; and the code &lt;math&gt;C_{in}^i&lt;/math&gt; has distance &lt;math&gt;\geqslant H_q^{-1}(\tfrac{1}{2}-\varepsilon) \cdot 2k,&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \left (C^*(m_1),C^*(m_2) \right ) \geqslant H_q^{-1} \left (\tfrac{1}{2}-\varepsilon \right ) \cdot 2k \cdot T.&lt;/math&gt;

So now the final task is to find a lower bound for &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Define:

:&lt;math&gt; S = \left \{ i  \ : \ 1 \leqslant i \leqslant N, c_i^1 \ne c_i^2 \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the number of linear codes &lt;math&gt;C_{in}^i, i \in S&lt;/math&gt; having the distance &lt;math&gt;H_q^{-1}\left (\tfrac{1}{2}-\varepsilon \right) \cdot 2k.&lt;/math&gt;

Now we want to estimate &lt;math&gt;|S|.&lt;/math&gt; Obviously &lt;math&gt;|S|= \Delta(C_{out}(m_1),C_{out}(m_2)) \geqslant (1-R)N&lt;/math&gt;.

Due to the [[Wozencraft ensemble|Wozencraft Ensemble Theorem]], there are at most &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon N&lt;/math&gt; linear codes having distance less than &lt;math&gt;H_q^{-1}(\tfrac{1}{2}-\varepsilon) \cdot 2k,&lt;/math&gt; so

:&lt;math&gt;T \geqslant |S| - \varepsilon N \geqslant (1-R)N - \varepsilon N = (1-R-\varepsilon)N.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(C^*(m_1),C^*(m_2)) \geqslant H_q^{-1} \left (\tfrac{1}{2}-\varepsilon \right ) \cdot 2k \cdot T \geqslant H_q^{-1} \left (\tfrac{1}{2}-\varepsilon \right ) \cdot 2k \cdot (1-R-\varepsilon) \cdot N.&lt;/math&gt;

This is true for any arbitrary &lt;math&gt;m_1 \ne m_2&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; has the relative distance at least &lt;math&gt;(1-R-\varepsilon)H_q^{-1} \left (\tfrac{1}{2}-\varepsilon \right ),&lt;/math&gt; which completes the proof.

==Comments==
We want to consider the "strongly explicit code". So the question is what the "strongly explicit code" is. Loosely speaking, for linear code, the "explicit" property is related to the complexity of constructing its generator matrix G. 

That in effect means that we can compute the matrix in logarithmic space without using the brute force algorithm to verify that a code has a given satisfied distance.

For the other codes that are not linear, we can consider the complexity of the encoding algorithm.

So by far, we can see that the Wonzencraft ensemble and Reed-Solomon codes  are strongly explicit. Therefore, we have the following result:

'''''Corollary:''''' The concatenated code &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is an asymptotically good code(that is, rate &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; &gt; 0 and relative distance &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; &gt; 0 for small q) and has a strongly explicit construction.

==An example of a Justesen code==

The following slightly different code is referred to as the Justesen code in MacWilliams/MacWilliams. It is the particular case of the above-considered 
Justesen code for a very particular Wonzencraft ensemble:

Let ''R'' be a Reed-Solomon code of length ''N'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, [[dimension (vector space)|rank]] ''K'' and minimum weight ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''K''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.  

The symbols of ''R'' are elements of ''F'' = GF(2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;) and the codewords are obtained by taking every polynomial &amp;fnof; over ''F'' of degree less than ''K'' and listing the values of &amp;fnof; on the non-zero elements of ''F'' in some predetermined order.  

Let α be a [[primitive element (finite field)|primitive element]] of ''F''.  For a codeword '''a''' = (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;) from ''R'', let '''b''' be the vector of length 2''N'' over ''F'' given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{b} = \left( a_1, a_1, a_2, \alpha^1 a_2, \ldots, a_N, \alpha^{N-1} a_N \right) &lt;/math&gt;

and let '''c''' be the vector of length 2''N'' ''m'' obtained from ''b'' by expressing each element of ''F'' as a binary vector of length ''m''.  The ''Justesen code'' is the linear code containing all such '''c'''.

The parameters of this code are length 2''m'' ''N'', dimension ''m'' ''K'' and [[Block code|minimum distance]] at least

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^\ell i \binom{2m}{i} , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the greatest integer satisfying &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^\ell \binom{2m}{i}\leq N-K+1&lt;/math&gt;. (See MacWilliams/MacWilliams for a proof.)

The '''KSD-64[A] Crypto Ignition Key (CIK)''' is an [[National Security Agency|NSA]]-developed [[EEPROM]] chip packed in a plastic case that looks like a toy [[key (lock)|key]].  The model number is due to its storage capacity &amp;mdash; 64&amp;nbsp;kibibits (65,536{{nbsp}}bits, or 8{{nbsp}}[[Kibibyte|KiB]]), enough to store multiple [[key (cryptography)|encryption keys]].  Most frequently it was used in [[key splitting|key-splitting]] applications: either the encryption device or the '''KSD-64''' alone is worthless, but together they can be used to make encrypted connections.  It was also used alone as a [[fill device]] for transfer of key material, as for the initial seed key loading of an [[STU-III]] secure phone.

Newer systems, such as the [[Secure Terminal Equipment]], use the [[Fortezza]] PC card as a [[security token]] instead of the KSD-64. The KSD-64 was withdrawn from the market in 2014. Over one million were produced in its 30-year life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://datakey.com/blog/a-30-year-run-for-the-parallel-key-line A 30-Year Run for the Parallel Key Line], Datakey, December 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
The CIK is a small device which can be loaded with a 128·bit sequence which is different for each user. When the device is removed from the machine, that sequence is automatically added (mod 2) to the unique key in the machine, thus leaving it stored in encrypted form. When it is reattached, the unique key in the machine is decrypted, and it is now ready to operate in the normal way. The analogy with an automobile ignition key is close, thus the name. If the key is lost, the user is still safe unless the finder or thief can match it with the user's machine. In case of loss, the user gets a new CIK, effectively changing the lock in the cipher machine, and gets back in business.

The ignition key sequence can be provided in several ways. In the first crypto-equipment to use the idea (the KY-70), the CIK is loaded with its sequence at NSA and supplied to each user like any other item of keying material. Follow-on application (as in the STU-II) use an even more clever scheme. The CIK device is simply an empty register which can be supplied with its unique sequence from the randomizer function of the parent machine itself. Not only that, each time the device is removed and re-inserted, it gets a brand new sequence. The effect of this procedure is to provide high protection against the covert compromise of the CIK wherein a thief acquires the device, copies it, and replaces it unknown to its owner. The next morning (say), when the user inserts the device, it will receive a new sequence and the old copied one will be useless thereafter. If the thief has gotten to his machine during the night, he may be able to act into the net; but when the user attempts to start up in the morning the thief's device will no longer work, thus flagging the fact that penetration has occurred.

This concept appears particularly attractive in office environments where physical structures and guarding arrangements will not be sufficiently rigorous to assure that crypto-equipments cannot be accessed by unauthorized people.&lt;ref name=boaklectures&gt;https://www.governmentattic.org/18docs/Hist_US_COMSEC_Boak_NSA_1973u.pdf A History of U.S. Communications Security; the David G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5013">In [[mathematics]], '''Legendre's three-square theorem''' states that a [[natural number]]  can be represented as the sum of three squares of integers

:&lt;math&gt;n = x^2 + y^2 + z^2&lt;/math&gt;

if and only if {{mvar|n}} is not of the form &lt;math&gt;n = 4^a(8b + 7)&lt;/math&gt; for integers {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}.

The first numbers that cannot be expressed as the sum of three squares (i.e. numbers that can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;n = 4^a(8b + 7)&lt;/math&gt;) are
:7, 15, 23, 28, 31, 39, 47, 55, 60, 63, 71 ... {{OEIS|A004215}}.

== History ==

[[Pierre de Fermat]] gave a criterion for numbers of the form 3''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 to be a sum of three squares essentially equivalent to Legendre's theorem, but did not provide a proof.
N. Beguelin noticed in 1774&lt;ref&gt;''Nouveaux Mémoires de l'Académie de Berlin'' (1774, publ. 1776), pp.&amp;nbsp;313–369.&lt;/ref&gt; that every positive integer which is neither of the form 8''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7, nor of the form 4''n'', is the sum of three squares, but did not provide a satisfactory proof.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Eugene Dickson]], ''History of the theory of numbers'', vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;15 (Carnegie Institute of Washington 1919; AMS Chelsea Publ., 1992, reprint).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1796 Gauss proved his [[Eureka theorem]] that every positive integer ''n'' is the sum of 3 [[triangular number]]s; this is equivalent to the fact that 8''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3 is a sum of three squares. In 1797 or 1798 [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|A.-M. Legendre]] obtained the first proof of his 3 square theorem.&lt;ref&gt;A.-M. Legendre, ''Essai sur la théorie des nombres'', Paris, An VI (1797–1798), {{p.|202}} and pp.&amp;nbsp;398–399.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1813, [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|A. L. Cauchy]] noted&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Cauchy, ''Mém. Sci. Math. Phys. de l'Institut de France'', (1) 14 (1813–1815), 177.&lt;/ref&gt;  that Legendre's theorem is equivalent to the statement in the introduction above. Previously, in 1801, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|C. F. Gauss]] had obtained a more general result,&lt;ref&gt;C. F. Gauss, ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'', Art. 291 et 292.&lt;/ref&gt; containing Legendre theorem of 1797–8 as a corollary. In particular, Gauss counted the number of solutions of the expression of an integer as a sum of three squares, and this is a generalisation of  yet another result of Legendre,&lt;ref&gt;A.-M. Legendre, ''Hist. et Mém. Acad. Roy. Sci. Paris'', 1785, pp.&amp;nbsp;514–515.&lt;/ref&gt; whose proof is incomplete. This last fact appears to be the reason for later incorrect claims according to which Legendre's proof of the three-square theorem was defective and had to be completed by Gauss.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance: Elena Deza and M. Deza. ''Figurate numbers''. World Scientific 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;314 [https://books.google.ch/books?id=cDxYdstLPz4C&amp;pg=PA314&amp;lpg=PA314&amp;dq=%22figurate+numbers%22+incomplete+legendre+gauss++-wikipedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rAuaEsw2cA&amp;sig=0wZEagVD2TzGjMVG1Xv_Cj-VYZo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1ARgU7CuG4Kw4QSPqYG4BA&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22figurate%20numbers%22%20incomplete%20legendre%20gauss%20%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Lagrange's four-square theorem]] and the [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares|two-square theorem]] of Girard, Fermat and Euler, the [[Waring's problem]] for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 is entirely solved.

== Proofs ==

The "only if" of the theorem  is simply because [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] 8, every square is congruent to 0, 1 or&amp;nbsp;4. There are several proofs of the converse (besides Legendre's proof). One of them is due to [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet|J. P. G. L. Dirichlet]] in 1850, and has become classical.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance vol. I, parts I, II and III of : [[Edmund Landau|E. Landau]], ''Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie'', New York, Chelsea, 1927. Second edition translated into English by Jacob E. Goodman, Providence RH, Chelsea, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; It requires three main lemmas:
*the [[quadratic reciprocity]] law,
*[[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]], and
*the equivalence class of the trivial ternary [[quadratic form]].

== Relationship to the four-square theorem ==

This theorem can be used to prove [[Lagrange's four-square theorem]], which states that all natural numbers can be written as a sum of four squares. Gauss&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Carl Friedrich |last=Gauss|title=Disquisitiones Arithmeticae|publisher= Yale University Press|year= 1965|isbn=0-300-09473-6|page=342, section 293}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the four squares theorem follows easily from the fact that any positive integer that is 1 or 2 mod 4 is a sum of 3 squares, because any positive integer not divisible by 4 can be reduced to this form by subtracting 0 or 1 from it.
However, proving the three-square theorem is considerably more difficult than a direct proof of the four-square theorem that does not use the three-square theorem. Indeed, the four-square theorem was proved earlier, in 1770.

A '''mathematical model''' is a description of a [[system]] using [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts and [[Language of mathematics|language]]. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed '''mathematical modeling'''. Mathematical models are used in the [[natural science]]s (such as [[physics]], [[biology]], [[earth science]], [[chemistry]]) and [[engineering]] disciplines (such as [[computer science]], [[electrical engineering]]), as well      as in the [[social sciences]] (such as [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]]). 

A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behaviour.

== Elements of a mathematical model ==

Mathematical models can take many forms, including [[dynamical systems]], [[statistical model]]s, [[differential equations]], or [[Game theory|game theoretic models]].  These and other types of models can overlap, with a given  model involving a variety of abstract structures. In general, mathematical models may include [[model theory|logical models]].  In many cases, the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models developed on the theoretical side agree with results of repeatable experiments.  Lack of agreement between theoretical mathematical models and experimental measurements often leads to important advances as better theories are developed.

In the [[physical sciences]], a traditional mathematical model contains most of the following elements:
# [[Governing equation|Governing equations]]
# Supplementary sub-models
## [[Defining equation (physics)|Defining equations]]
## [[Constitutive equation|Constitutive equations]]
# Assumptions and constraints
## [[Initial condition|Initial]] and [[Boundary condition|boundary conditions]]
## [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|Classical constraints]] and [[Kinematics|kinematic equations]]

== Classifications ==
Mathematical models are usually composed of relationships and ''[[variable (mathematics)|variables]]''. Relationships can be described by ''[[Operator (mathematics)|operators]]'', such as algebraic operators, functions, differential operators, etc. Variables are abstractions of system [[parameter (computer programming)|parameters]] of interest, that can be [[Quantification (science)|quantified]]. Several classification criteria can be used for mathematical models according to their structure:
* '''Linear vs. nonlinear:''' If all the operators in a mathematical model exhibit [[linear]]ity, the resulting mathematical model is defined as linear. A model is considered to be nonlinear otherwise. The definition of linearity and nonlinearity is dependent on context, and linear models may have nonlinear expressions in them.  For example, in a [[Linear model|statistical linear model]], it is assumed that a relationship is linear in the parameters, but it may be nonlinear in the predictor variables.  Similarly, a differential equation is said to be linear if it can be written with linear [[differential operator]]s, but it can still have nonlinear expressions in it.  In a [[Optimization (mathematics)|mathematical programming]] model, if the objective functions and constraints are represented entirely by [[linear equation]]s, then the model is regarded as a linear model.  If one or more of the objective functions or constraints are represented with a [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] equation, then the model is known as a nonlinear model.&lt;br&gt;Nonlinearity, even in fairly simple systems, is often associated with phenomena such as [[Chaos theory|chaos]] and [[irreversibility]].  Although there are exceptions, nonlinear systems and models tend to be more difficult to study than linear ones.  A common approach to nonlinear problems is [[linearization]], but this can be problematic if one is trying to study aspects such as irreversibility, which are strongly tied to nonlinearity.
* '''Static vs. dynamic:''' A ''dynamic'' model  accounts for time-dependent changes in the state of the system, while a ''static'' (or steady-state) model calculates the system in equilibrium, and thus is time-invariant.  Dynamic models typically are represented by [[differential equation]]s or [[difference equation]]s.
* '''Explicit vs. implicit:''' If all of the input parameters of the overall model are known, and the output parameters can be calculated by a finite series of computations, the model is said to be ''explicit''. But sometimes it is the ''output'' parameters which are known, and the corresponding inputs must be solved for by an iterative procedure, such as [[Newton's method]] (if the model is linear) or [[Broyden's method]] (if non-linear). In such a case the model is said to be ''implicit''. For example, a [[jet engine]]'s physical properties such as turbine and nozzle throat areas can be explicitly calculated given a design [[thermodynamic cycle]] (air and fuel flow rates, pressures, and temperatures) at a specific flight condition and power setting, but the engine's operating cycles at other flight conditions and power settings cannot be explicitly calculated from the constant physical properties.
* '''Discrete vs. continuous:''' A [[discrete modeling|discrete model]] treats objects as discrete, such as the particles in a [[molecular model]] or the states in a [[statistical model]]; while a [[continuous model]] represents the objects in a continuous manner, such as the velocity field of fluid in pipe flows, temperatures and stresses in a solid, and electric field that applies continuously over the entire model due to a point charge.
* '''Deterministic vs. probabilistic (stochastic):''' A [[deterministic system|deterministic]] model is one in which every set of variable states is uniquely determined by parameters in the model and by sets of previous states of these variables; therefore, a deterministic model always performs the same way for a given set of initial conditions. Conversely, in a stochastic model—usually called a "[[statistical model]]"—randomness is present, and variable states are not described by unique values, but rather by [[probability]] distributions.
* '''Deductive, inductive, or floating:''' A deductive model is a logical structure based on a theory. An inductive model arises from empirical findings and generalization from them. The floating model rests on neither theory nor observation, but is merely the invocation of expected structure. Application of mathematics in social sciences outside of economics has been criticized for unfounded models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stanislav Andreski |first=Stanislav |last=Andreski |year=1972 |title=Social Sciences as Sorcery |publisher=[[St. Martin’s Press]] |isbn=0-14-021816-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of [[catastrophe theory]] in science has been characterized as a floating model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Clifford Truesdell |first=Clifford |last=Truesdell |year=1984 |title=An Idiot’s Fugitive Essays on Science |pages=121–7 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-90703-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance in the natural sciences ==
Mathematical models are of great importance in the natural sciences, particularly in [[physics]]. Physical [[theory|theories]] are almost invariably expressed using mathematical models.

Throughout history, more and more accurate mathematical models have been developed. [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws]] accurately describe many everyday phenomena, but at certain limits [[relativity theory]] and [[quantum mechanics]] must be used; even these do not apply to all situations and need further refinement{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Examples|date=September 2017}}. It is possible to obtain the less accurate models in appropriate limits, for example relativistic mechanics reduces to Newtonian mechanics at speeds much less than the [[speed of light]]. Quantum mechanics reduces to classical physics when the quantum numbers are high. For example, the [[de Broglie wavelength]] of a tennis ball is insignificantly small, so classical physics is a good approximation to use in this case.

It is common to use idealized models in physics to simplify things. Massless ropes, point particles, [[ideal gases]] and the [[particle in a box]] are among the many simplified models used in physics. The laws of physics are represented with simple equations such as Newton's laws, [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Schrödinger equation]]. These laws are such as a basis for making mathematical models of real situations. Many real situations are very complex and thus modeled approximate on a computer, a model that is computationally feasible to compute is made from the basic laws or from approximate models made from the basic laws. For example, molecules can be modeled by [[molecular orbital]] models that are approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation. In [[engineering]], physics models are often made by mathematical methods such as [[finite element analysis]].

Different mathematical models use different geometries that are not necessarily accurate descriptions of the geometry of the universe. [[Euclidean geometry]] is much used in classical physics, while [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]] are examples of theories that use [[geometry|geometries]] which are not Euclidean.

== Some applications==&lt;!--whatever this section is, it isn't background (original heading), and isn't general--&gt;
Since [[prehistory|prehistorical times]] simple models such as [[map]]s and [[Mathematical diagram|diagrams]] have been used.

Often when engineers analyze a system to be controlled or optimized, they use a mathematical model. In analysis, engineers can build a descriptive model of the system as a hypothesis of how the system could work, or try to estimate how an unforeseeable event could affect the system. Similarly, in control of a system, engineers can try out different control approaches in [[simulation]]s.

A mathematical model usually describes a system by a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of variables and a set of equations that establish relationships between the variables. Variables may be of many types; [[Real number|real]] or [[integer]] numbers, [[Boolean data type|boolean]] values or [[String (computing)|strings]], for example. The variables represent some properties of the system, for example, measured system outputs often in the form of [[Signal (electronics)|signals]], [[Chronometry|timing data]], counters, and event occurrence (yes/no). The actual model is the set of functions that describe the relations between the different variables.

== Building blocks ==
In [[business]] and [[engineering]], mathematical models may be used to maximize a certain output. The system under consideration will require certain inputs. The system relating inputs to outputs depends on other variables too: [[decision theory|decision variables]], [[state variable]]s, [[Exogeny|exogenous]] variables, and [[random variable]]s.

Decision variables are sometimes known as independent variables.  Exogenous variables are sometimes known as [[parameter]]s or [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]s.
The variables are not independent of each other as the state variables are dependent on the decision, input, random, and exogenous variables.  Furthermore, the output variables are dependent on the state of the system (represented by the state variables).

[[Goal|Objective]]s and [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s of the system and its users can be represented as [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of the output variables or state variables.  The [[objective function]]s will depend on the perspective of the model's user.  Depending on the context, an objective function is also known as an ''index of performance'', as it is some measure of interest to the user.  Although there is no limit to the number of objective functions and constraints a model can have, using or optimizing the model becomes more involved (computationally) as the number increases.

For example, [[economist]]s often apply [[linear algebra]] when using [[input-output model]]s. Complicated mathematical models that have many variables may be consolidated by use of [[vector space|vectors]] where one symbol represents several variables.

== A priori information ==
[[File:Blackbox3D-withGraphs.png|thumb|480px|To analyse something with a typical "black box approach", only  the behavior of the stimulus/response will be accounted for, to infer the (unknown) ''box''. The usual representation of this ''black box system''  is a [[data flow diagram]] centered in the box.]]

Mathematical modeling problems are often classified into [[black box]] or [[White box (software engineering)|white box]] models, according to how much [[a priori (philosophy)|a priori]] information on the system is available. A black-box model is a system of which there is no a priori information available. A white-box model (also called glass box or clear box) is a system where all necessary information is available. Practically all systems are somewhere between the black-box and white-box models, so this concept is useful only as an intuitive guide for deciding which approach to take.

Usually it is preferable to use as much a priori information as possible to make the model more accurate. Therefore, the white-box models are usually considered easier, because if you have used the information correctly, then the model will behave correctly. Often the a priori information comes in forms of knowing the type of functions relating different variables. For example, if we make a model of how a medicine works in a human system, we know that usually the amount of medicine in the blood is an [[exponential decay|exponentially decaying]] function. But we are still left with several unknown parameters; how rapidly does the medicine amount decay, and what is the initial amount of medicine in blood? This example is therefore not a completely white-box model. These parameters have to be estimated through some means before one can use the model.

In black-box models one tries to estimate both the functional form of relations between variables and the numerical parameters in those functions. Using a priori information we could end up, for example, with a set of functions that probably could describe the system adequately. If there is no a priori information we would try to use functions as general as possible to cover all different models. An often used approach for black-box models are [[artificial neural network|neural networks]] which usually do not make assumptions about incoming data. Alternatively the NARMAX (Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model with eXogenous inputs) algorithms which were developed as part of [[nonlinear system identification]] &lt;ref name="SAB1"&gt;Billings S.A. (2013), ''Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains'', Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to select the model terms, determine the model structure, and estimate the unknown parameters in the presence of correlated and nonlinear noise. The advantage of NARMAX models compared to neural networks is that NARMAX produces models that can be written down and related to the underlying process, whereas neural networks produce an approximation that is opaque.

=== Subjective information ===
Sometimes it is useful to incorporate subjective information into a mathematical model.  This can be done based on [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[experience]], or [[expert opinion]], or based on convenience of mathematical form.  [[Bayesian statistics]] provides a theoretical framework for incorporating such subjectivity into a rigorous analysis: we specify a [[prior probability distribution]] (which can be subjective), and then update this distribution based on empirical data.

An example of when such approach would be necessary is a situation in which an experimenter bends a coin slightly and tosses it once, recording whether it comes up heads, and is then given the task of predicting the probability that the next flip comes up heads.  After bending the coin, the true probability that the coin will come up heads is unknown; so the experimenter would need to make a decision (perhaps by looking at the shape of the coin) about what prior distribution to use.  Incorporation of such subjective information might be important to get an accurate estimate of the probability.

== Complexity ==
In general, model complexity involves a trade-off between simplicity and accuracy of the model.  [[Occam's razor]] is a principle particularly relevant to modeling, its essential idea being that among models with roughly equal predictive power, the simplest one is the most desirable.  While added complexity usually improves the realism of a model, it can make the model difficult to understand and analyze, and can also pose computational problems, including [[numerical instability]].  [[Thomas Kuhn]] argues that as science progresses, explanations tend to become more complex before a [[paradigm shift]] offers radical simplification {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

For example, when modeling the flight of an aircraft, we could embed each mechanical part of the aircraft into our model and would thus acquire an almost white-box model of the system. However, the computational cost of adding such a huge amount of detail would effectively inhibit the usage of such a model. Additionally, the uncertainty would increase due to an overly complex system, because each separate part induces some amount of variance into the model. It is therefore usually appropriate to make some approximations to reduce the model to a sensible size. Engineers often can accept some approximations in order to get a more robust and simple model. For example, [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[classical mechanics]] is an approximated model of the real world. Still, Newton's model is quite sufficient for most ordinary-life situations, that is, as long as particle speeds are well below the [[speed of light]], and we study macro-particles only.

== Training and tuning ==
Any model which is not pure white-box contains some [[parameter]]s that can be used to fit the model to the system it is intended to describe. If the modeling is done by an [[artificial neural network]] or other [[machine learning]], the optimization of parameters is called ''training''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Why|date=September 2017}}, while the optimization of model hyperparameters is called ''tuning'' and often uses [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. In more conventional modeling through explicitly given mathematical functions, parameters are often determined by ''[[curve fitting]]''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

== Model evaluation ==
A crucial part of the modeling process is the evaluation of whether or not a given mathematical model describes a system accurately.  This question can be difficult to answer as it involves several different types of evaluation.

=== Fit to empirical data ===
Usually the easiest part of model evaluation is checking whether a model fits experimental measurements or other empirical data.  In models with parameters, a common approach to test this fit is to split the data into two disjoint subsets: training data and verification data. The training data are used to estimate the model parameters.  An accurate model will closely match the verification data even though these data were not used to set the model's parameters. This practice is referred to as [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] in statistics.

Defining a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] to measure distances between observed and predicted data is a useful tool of assessing model fit.  In statistics, decision theory, and some [[economic model]]s, a [[loss function]] plays a similar role.

While it is rather straightforward to test the appropriateness of parameters, it can be more difficult to test the validity of the general mathematical form of a model.  In general, more mathematical tools have been developed to test the fit of [[statistical model]]s than models involving [[differential equations]].  Tools from [[non-parametric statistics]] can sometimes be used to evaluate how well the data fit a known distribution or to come up with a general model that makes only minimal assumptions about the model's mathematical form.

=== Scope of the model ===
Assessing the scope of a model, that is, determining what situations the model is applicable to, can be less straightforward.  If the model was constructed based on a set of data, one must determine for which systems or situations the known data is a "typical" set of data.

The question of whether the model describes well the properties of the system between data points is called [[interpolation]], and the same question for events or data points outside the observed data is called [[extrapolation]].

As an example of the typical limitations of the scope of a model, in evaluating Newtonian [[classical mechanics]], we can note that Newton made his measurements without advanced equipment, so he could not measure properties of particles travelling at speeds close to the speed of light.  Likewise, he did not measure the movements of molecules and other small particles, but macro particles only. It is then not surprising that his model does not extrapolate well into these domains, even though his model is quite sufficient for ordinary life physics.

=== Philosophical considerations ===
Many types of modeling implicitly involve claims about [[causality]].  This is usually (but not always) true of models involving differential equations.  As the purpose of modeling is to increase our understanding of the world, the validity of a model rests not only on its fit to empirical observations, but also on its ability to extrapolate to situations or data beyond those originally described in the model. One can think of this as the differentiation between qualitative and quantitative predictions. One can also argue that a model is worthless unless it provides some insight which goes beyond what is already known from direct investigation of the phenomenon being studied.

An example of such criticism is the argument that the mathematical models of [[optimal foraging theory]] do not offer insight that goes beyond the common-sense conclusions of [[evolution]] and other basic principles of ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pyke | first1 = G. H. | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002515 | title = Optimal Foraging Theory: A Critical Review | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 15 | pages = 523–575 | year = 1984 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* One of the popular examples in [[computer science]] is the mathematical models of various machines, an example is the [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA) which is defined as an abstract mathematical concept, but due to the deterministic nature of a DFA, it is implementable in hardware and software for solving various specific problems. For example, the following is a DFA M with a binary alphabet, which requires that the input contains an even number of 0s.

[[File:DFAexample.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[state diagram]] for ''M'']]
''M'' = (''Q'', Σ, δ, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F'') where
*''Q'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;},
*Σ = {0, 1},
*''q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,
*''F'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}, and
*δ is defined by the following [[state transition table]]:
:{| border="1" cell padding="1" cell spacing="0"
| || &lt;center&gt;'''0'''&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;'''1'''&lt;/center&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

The state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents that there has been an even number of 0s in the input so far, while ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signifies an odd number. A 1 in the input does not change the state of the automaton. When the input ends, the state will show whether the input contained an even number of 0s or not. If the input did contain an even number of 0s, ''M'' will finish in state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, an accepting state, so the input string will be accepted.

The language recognized by ''M'' is the [[regular language]] given by the [[regular expression]] 1*( 0 (1*) 0 (1*) )*, where "*" is the [[Kleene star]], e.g., 1* denotes any non-negative number (possibly zero) of symbols "1".

* Many everyday activities carried out without a thought are uses of mathematical models. A geographical [[map projection]] of a region of the earth onto a small, plane surface  is a model&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landinfo.com/resources_dictionaryMP.htm landinfo.com, definition of map projection]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used for many purposes such as planning travel.
* Another simple activity is predicting the position of a vehicle from its initial position, direction and speed of travel, using the equation that distance traveled is the product of time and speed. This is known as [[dead reckoning]] when used more formally. Mathematical modeling in this way does not necessarily require formal mathematics; animals have been shown to use dead reckoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gallistel |first= |title=The Organization of Learning |location=Cambridge |publisher=The MIT Press |year=1990 |ISBN=0-262-07113-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Whishaw | first1 = I.

* ''[[Population]] Growth''. A simple (though approximate) model of population growth is the [[Malthusian growth model]]. A slightly more realistic and largely used population growth model is the [[logistic function]], and its extensions. 
* ''Model of a particle  in a potential-field''. In this model we consider a particle as being a point of mass which describes a trajectory in space which is modeled by a function giving its coordinates in space as a function of time. The potential field is given by a function &lt;math&gt;V\!:\mathbb{R}^3\!\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and the trajectory, that is a function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}\!:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, is the solution of the [[differential equation]]:

::&lt;math&gt; -\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}m=\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial x}\mathbf{\hat{x}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial y}\mathbf{\hat{y}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial z}\mathbf{\hat{z}}, &lt;/math&gt;

that can be written also as:

::&lt;math&gt; m\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=-\nabla V[\mathbf{r}(t)]. &lt;/math&gt;

:Note this model assumes  the particle is a point mass, which is certainly known to be false in many cases in which we use this model; for example, as a model of planetary motion.

* ''Model of rational behavior for a consumer''.  In this model we assume a consumer faces a choice of ''n'' commodities labeled 1,2,...,''n'' each with a market price ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. The consumer is assumed to have an [[ordinal utility]] function ''U'' (ordinal in the sense that only the sign of the differences between two utilities, and not the level of each utility, is meaningful), depending on the amounts of commodities ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; consumed.  The model further assumes that the consumer has a budget ''M'' which is used to purchase a vector ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in such a way as to maximize ''U''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).  The problem of rational behavior in this model then becomes an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem, that is:
:: &lt;math&gt; \max U(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n) &lt;/math&gt;
:: subject to:
:: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i \leq M.&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; x_{i} \geq 0   \; \; \; \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n \} &lt;/math&gt;
: This model has been used in a wide variety of economic contexts, such as in [[general equilibrium theory]] to show existence and [[Pareto efficiency]] of economic equilibria.

'''Nathan Altshiller Court''' (1881-1968) was a Polish-American mathematician, a geometer in particular and author of the famous book ''College Geometry - An Introduction to the Modern Geometry of the Triangle and the Circle''.

==Biography==
Nathan Court was born on 22 January 1881, in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]].   He attended the ''University of Uege'' and the [[University of Ghent]] in [[Belgium]] where he received his D.Sc in 1911. Soon after he came to the [[United States]], he studied and taught at [[Columbia University]]. In 1912 he married ''Sophie Ravltch'', whom he had known in [[Warsaw]]. Dr. Court taught at the [[University of Washington]] and the [[University of Colorado]] before coming to the [[University of Oklahoma]] in 1918. In 1919, he became a U.S. citizen and changed his last name to Court, keeping Altshiller as a middle name. He became a full Professor at the [[University of Oklahoma]] in 1935 and retired in 1951. He died in Norman 20 July 1968.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2267">In [[numerical analysis]], '''order of accuracy''' quantifies the [[rate of convergence]] of a numerical approximation of a [[differential equation]] to the exact solution.
Consider &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, the exact solution to a differential equation in an appropriate normed space &lt;math&gt;(V,||\ ||)&lt;/math&gt;. Consider a numerical approximation &lt;math&gt;u_h&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter characterizing the approximation, such as the step size in a finite difference scheme or the diameter of the cells in a [[Finite_element_method|finite element method]].
The numerical solution &lt;math&gt;u_h&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th-order accurate''' if the error, &lt;math&gt;E(h):= ||u-u_h||&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the step-size &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; to the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th power;&lt;ref name="LeVeque"&gt;{{cite book|last=LeVeque|first=Randall J|title=Finite Difference Methods for Differential Equations|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.111.1693|year=2006|publisher=University of Washington|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; E(h) = ||u-u_h|| \leq Ch^n &lt;/math&gt;

Where the constant &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is independent of h and usually depends on the solution &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ciarliet|first=Philippe J|title=The Finite Element Method for Elliptic Problems|url=https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9780898719208|year=1978|publisher=Elsevier|pages=105-106}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Using the [[big O notation]] an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th-order accurate numerical method is notated as

:&lt;math&gt; ||u-u_h|| = O(h^n) &lt;/math&gt;

This definition is strictly depended on the norm used in the space; the choice of such norm is fundamental to estimate the rate of convergence and, in general, all numerical errors correctly.

The size of the error of a first-order accurate approximation is directly proportional to &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;.
[[Partial differential equations]] which vary over both time and space are said to be accurate to order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in time and to order &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; in space.&lt;ref name="Strikwerda"&gt;{{cite book|last=Strikwerda|first=John C|title=Finite Difference Schemes and Partial Differential Equations|edition=2|year=2004|isbn=978-0-898716-39-9|pages=62–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philippa Garrett Fawcett''' (4 April 1868 – 10 June 1948) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mathematician]] and [[educationalist]].

==Family==
Philippa Garrett Fawcett was the daughter of the [[suffragist]] [[Millicent Fawcett]] and  [[Henry Fawcett]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]], Professor of [[Political Economy]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] in [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone's]] government. Her aunt was [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson]], the first English female doctor. When her father died, she and her mother went to live with Millicent's sister [[Agnes Garrett]], who had set up an interior design business on [[Gower Street, London|Gower Street]], [[Bloomsbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury-project/articles/events/conference2011/crawford.pdf |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Philippa Fawcett was educated at [[Bedford College, London]]&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian Bloomsbury by Rosemary Ashton|url=https://books.google.com/?id=u9gDEx6iZ5EC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=a+second+generation+of+feminists+attended+Bedford+College+after+its+removal+from+bloomsbury#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20second%20generation%20of%20feminists%20attended%20Bedford%20College%20after%20its%20removal%20from%20bloomsbury&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 June 2018|isbn=9780300154474|last1=Ashton|first1=Rosemary|date=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now [[Royal Holloway]]) and [[Newnham College, Cambridge]] which had been co-founded by her mother. In 1890 she became the first woman to obtain the top score in the Cambridge [[Mathematical Tripos]] exams. The results were highly publicised, with the top scorers receiving great acclaim.  Her score was 13 per cent higher than the second highest, but she did not receive the title of [[senior wrangler]], as only men were then ranked and women were listed separately. Women had been allowed to take the Tripos since 1880, after [[Charlotte Angas Scott]] was unofficially ranked as eighth wrangler. When the women's list was announced Fawcett was described as "above the senior wrangler". No woman was officially awarded the first position until Ruth Hendry in 1992.

Coming amidst the [[women's suffrage]] movement, Fawcett's feat gathered worldwide media coverage, spurring much discussion about women's capacities and rights. The lead story in the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' the following day said:

{{centered pull quote| Once again has woman demonstrated her superiority in the face of an incredulous and somewhat unsympathetic world... And now the last trench has been carried by Amazonian assault, and the whole citadel of learning lies open and defenceless before the victorious students of Newnham and Girton. There is no longer any field of learning in which the lady student does not excel.&lt;ref&gt;Series, Caroline. "And what became of the women?", Mathematical Spectrum, Vol. 30 (1997/8), 49-52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Career==
Following Fawcett's achievement in the Tripos, she won the [[Marion Kennedy]] scholarship at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]&lt;ref name=newn&gt;[http://www.newn.cam.ac.uk/about/history/biographies/ Marion Kennedy], Newnham College, Retrieved 22 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; through which she conducted research in [[fluid dynamics]]. Her published papers include "Note on the Motion of Solids in a Liquid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

She was appointed a college lecturer in Mathematics at Newnham College, a position she held for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/fawcett.htm "Philippa Fawcett", Biographies of Women Mathematicians], [[Agnes Scott College]]&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, her teaching abilities received considerable praise. One student wrote:

{{centered pull quote| What I remember most vividly of Miss Fawcett's coaching was her concentration, speed, and infectious delight in what she was teaching. She was ruthless towards mistakes and carelessness... My deepest debt to her is a sense of the unity of all truth, from the smallest detail to the highest that we know&lt;ref&gt;Newnham College Roll Letter, February 1949, 46-54. Newnham College Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Fawcett left Cambridge in 1902, when she was appointed as a lecturer to train mathematics teachers at the [[normal school|Normal School]] in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140311193735/http://www.slonfawcett.org.uk/userfiles/documents/2012%20philippa%20fawcett%20biography.pdf South London Fawcett Group Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; now [[University of Pretoria#Groenkloof, Pretoria|part of the University of Pretoria]]. She remained there, setting up schools in South Africa, until 1905, when she returned to Britain to take a position in the administration of education for [[London County Council]]. At the LCC, in her work developing [[secondary school]]s, she attained a high rank. Denied a Cambridge degree by her sex, she was one of the [[steamboat ladies]] who travelled to Ireland between 1904 and 1907 to receive an [[ad eundem degree|''ad eundem'']] University of Dublin degree at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]].&lt;ref name="steamboat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/theme/61643 |title=Steamboat ladies (''act.'' 1904–1907) |last1=Parkes |first1=Susan M. |work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippa Fawcett maintained strong links with Newnham College throughout her life. The Fawcett building (1938) was named in recognition of her contribution to the college, and that of her family. She died on 10 June 1948, two months after her 80th birthday, a month after the Grace that allowed women to be awarded the Cambridge BA degree received royal assent.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Siklos, official [[Newnham College|Newnham]] biography of [http://www.newn.cam.ac.uk/about-newnham/college-history/biographies/content/philippa-fawcett/  Philippa Fawcett], 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5406">In [[mathematics]], a '''pseudogroup''' is an extension of the [[group (mathematics)|group]] concept, but one that grew out of the geometric approach of [[Sophus Lie]], rather than out of [[abstract algebra]] (such as [[quasigroup]], for example). A theory of pseudogroups was developed by [[Élie Cartan]] in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Élie|last = Cartan|title = Sur la structure des groupes infinis de transformations|journal = Annales Scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure|year = 1904|volume = 21|pages=153–206|url=http://archive.numdam.org/article/ASENS_1904_3_21__153_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Élie|last = Cartan|title = Les groupes de transformations continus, infinis, simples|journal = Annales Scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure|year = 1909|volume = 26|pages=93–161|url=http://archive.numdam.org/article/ASENS_1909_3_26__93_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not an axiomatic algebraic idea; rather it defines a set of closure conditions on sets of [[homeomorphism]]s defined on [[open set]]s ''U'' of a given [[Euclidean space]] ''E'' or more generally of a fixed [[topological space]] ''S''. The [[groupoid]] condition on those is fulfilled, in that homeomorphisms

:''h'':''U'' &amp;rarr; ''V''

and

:''g'':''V'' &amp;rarr; ''W''

compose to a ''homeomorphism'' from ''U'' to ''W''. The further requirement on a pseudogroup is related to the possibility of ''patching'' (in the sense of [[descent (category theory)|descent]], [[Transition map|transition functions]], or a [[gluing axiom]]).

Specifically, a '''pseudogroup''' on  a topological space ''S'' is a collection ''Γ'' of homeomorphisms between open subsets of ''S'' satisfying the following properties.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, Shoshichi &amp; Nomizu, Katsumi. ''Foundations of Differential Geometry, Volume I''.  Wiley Classics Library. John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., New York, 1996. Reprint of the 1969 original, A Wiley-Interscience Publication. {{isbn|0-471-15733-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* For every open set ''U'' in ''S'', the identity map on ''U'' is in ''Γ''.
* If ''f'' is in ''Γ'', then so is ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.
* If ''f'' is in ''Γ'', then the restriction of ''f'' to an arbitrary open subset of its domain is in ''Γ''.
* If ''U'' is open in ''S'', ''U'' is the union of the open sets {''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}, ''f'' is a homeomorphism from ''U'' to an open subset of ''S'', and the restriction of ''f'' to ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is in ''Γ'' for all ''i'', then ''f'' is in ''Γ''.
* If ''f'':''U'' → ''V'' and ''f &amp;prime;'':''U &amp;prime;'' → ''V &amp;prime;'' are in ''Γ'', and the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] ''V ∩ U &amp;prime;'' is not empty, then the following restricted composition is in ''Γ'':
:&lt;math&gt;f' \circ f \colon f^{-1}(V \cap U') \to f'(V \cap U')&lt;/math&gt;.

An example in space of two dimensions is the pseudogroup of invertible [[holomorphic function]]s of a [[complex variable]] (invertible in the sense of having an [[inverse function]]). The properties of this pseudogroup are what makes it possible to define [[Riemann surface]]s by local data patched together.

In general, pseudogroups were studied as a possible theory of [[infinite-dimensional Lie group]]s. The concept of a '''local Lie group''', namely a pseudogroup of functions defined in neighbourhoods of the origin of ''E'', is actually closer to Lie's original concept of [[Lie group]], in the case where the transformations involved depend on a finite number of [[parameter]]s, than the contemporary definition via [[manifold]]s. One of Cartan's achievements was to clarify the points involved, including the point that a local Lie group always gives rise to a ''global'' group, in the current sense (an analogue of [[Lie's third theorem]], on [[Lie algebra]]s determining a group). The [[formal group]] is yet another approach to the specification of Lie groups, infinitesimally. It is known, however, that ''local [[topological group]]s'' do not necessarily have global counterparts.

Examples of infinite-dimensional pseudogroups abound, beginning with the pseudogroup of all [[diffeomorphism]]s of ''E''. The interest is mainly in sub-pseudogroups of the diffeomorphisms, and therefore with objects that have a Lie algebra analogue of [[vector field]]s. Methods proposed by Lie and by Cartan for studying these objects have become more practical given the progress of [[computer algebra]].

In the 1950s Cartan's theory was reformulated by [[Shiing-Shen Chern]], and a general [[deformation theory]] for pseudogroups was developed by [[Kunihiko Kodaira]] and [[D. C. Spencer]]. In the 1960s [[homological algebra]] was applied to the basic [[partial differential equation|PDE]] questions involved, of over-determination; this though revealed that the algebra of the theory is potentially very heavy. In the same decade the interest for [[theoretical physics]] of infinite-dimensional Lie theory appeared for the first time, in the shape of [[current algebra]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1535">In the theory of [[partially ordered set]]s, a '''pseudoideal''' is a subset characterized by a bounding operator LU.
== Basic definitions ==
LU(''A'') is the set of all [[lower bound]]s of the set of all [[upper bound]]s of the subset ''A'' of a [[partially ordered set]].

A  subset ''I'' of a partially ordered set (''P'',≤) is a '''Doyle pseudoideal''', if the following condition holds:

For every finite subset ''S'' of ''P'' that has a [[supremum]] in ''P'', ''S''&lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; ''I''  implies that LU(''S'') &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; ''I''.

A  subset ''I'' of a partially ordered set (''P'',≤) is a '''pseudoideal''', if the following condition holds:

For every subset ''S'' of ''P'' having at most two elements that has a [[supremum]] in ''P'', ''S''&lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; ''I''  implies that LU(''S'') &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; ''I''.

== Remarks==
#Every [[Frink ideal]] ''I'' is a Doyle pseudoideal.
#A subset ''I'' of a lattice (''P'',≤) is a  Doyle pseudoideal [[if and only if]] it is a lower set that is closed under finite joins ([[suprema]]).

'''[[Rabbi]] Nehemiah''' was an [[Israelite]] mathematician, [[circa]] [[AD]] 150 (during the [[Tannaim]] era, Fourth Generation).

He is attributed as the author of the ''[[Mishnat ha-Middot]]'' (ca. AD 150), making it the earliest known [[Hebrew]] text on [[geometry]], although some historians assign the text to a later period by an unknown author.

The ''Mishnat ha-Middot'' argues against the common belief that the Bible defines the [[geometry|geometric]] ratio [[pi|{{pi}}]] (pi) as being exactly equal to 3, based on the description in [[1 Kings]] 7:23 (and [[2 Chronicles]] 4:2) of the [[Molten Sea|great bowl]] situated outside the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple of Jerusalem]] as having a diameter of 10 [[cubit]]s and a circumference of 30 cubits.  He maintained that the [[diameter]] of the bowl was measured from the ''outside'' brim, while the [[circumference]] was measured along the ''inner'' brim, which with a brim that is one [[hand (length)|handbreadth]] wide (as described in the subsequent verses 1 Kings 7:24 and 2 Chronicles 4:3) yields a ratio from the circular rim closer to the actual value of {{pi}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Petr Beckmann]], ''[[A History of Pi]]'', St. Martin's (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36219">In [[combinatorics|combinatorial mathematics]], '''Ramsey's theorem''' states that one will find monochromatic [[clique (graph theory)|cliques]] in any [[graph labeling|edge labelling]] (with colours) of a sufficiently large [[complete graph]]. To demonstrate the theorem for two colours (say, blue and red), let ''r'' and ''s'' be any two positive integers. Ramsey's theorem states that there exists a least positive integer {{nowrap|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} for which every blue-red edge colouring of the [[complete graph]] on {{nowrap|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} vertices contains a blue clique on ''r'' vertices or a red clique on ''s'' vertices. (Here {{nowrap|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} signifies an integer that depends on both ''r'' and ''s''.)

Ramsey's theorem is a foundational result in combinatorics. The first version of this result was proved by [[F. P. Ramsey]]. This initiated the combinatorial theory now called [[Ramsey theory]], that seeks regularity amid disorder: general conditions for the existence of substructures with regular properties. In this application it is a question of the existence of ''monochromatic subsets'', that is, subsets of connected edges of just one colour.

An extension of this theorem applies to any finite number of colours, rather than just two. More precisely, the theorem states that for any given number of colours, ''c'', and any given integers ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''n&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'', there is a number, ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''n&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''), such that if the edges of a complete graph of order ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;) are coloured with ''c'' different colours, then for some ''i'' between 1 and ''c'', it must contain a complete subgraph of order ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; whose edges are all colour ''i''. The special case above has ''c'' = 2 (and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r'' and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''s'').

==Example: ''R''(3, 3) = 6==
[[Image:RamseyTheory K5 no mono K3.svg|frame|A 2-edge-labeling of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with no monochromatic ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Suppose the edges of a complete graph on 6 vertices are coloured red and blue. Pick a vertex, ''v''. There are 5 edges incident to ''v'' and so (by the [[pigeonhole principle]]) at least 3 of them must be the same colour. [[Without loss of generality]] we can assume at least 3 of these edges, connecting the vertex, ''v'', to vertices, ''r'', ''s'' and ''t'', are blue. (If not, exchange red and blue in what follows.) If any of the edges, (''r'', ''s''), (''r'', ''t''), (''s'', ''t''), are also blue then we have an entirely blue triangle. If not, then those three edges are all red and we have an entirely red triangle. Since this argument works for any colouring, ''any'' ''K''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; contains a monochromatic ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and therefore ''R''(3, 3) ≤ 6. The popular version of this is called the [[theorem on friends and strangers]].

An alternative proof works by [[double counting (proof technique)|double counting]]. It goes as follows: Count the number of ordered triples of vertices, ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', such that the edge, (''xy''), is red and the edge, (''yz''), is blue. Firstly, any given vertex will be the middle of either 0&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 (all edges from the vertex are the same colour), 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 (four are the same colour, one is the other colour), or 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 (three are the same colour, two are the other colour) such triples. Therefore, there are at most 6&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;36 such triples. Secondly, for any non-monochromatic triangle ('''xyz'''), there exist precisely two such triples. Therefore, there are at most 18 non-monochromatic triangles. Therefore, at least 2 of the 20 triangles in the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; are monochromatic.

Conversely, it is possible to 2-colour a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; without creating any monochromatic ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, showing that ''R''(3, 3)&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;5. The unique&lt;ref&gt;up to automorphisms of the graph&lt;/ref&gt; colouring is shown to the right. Thus ''R''(3, 3)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6.

The task of proving that ''R''(3, 3)&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;6 was one of the problems of [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition]] in 1953, as well as in the Hungarian Math Olympiad in 1947.

==Proof of the theorem==

===2-colour case===
First we prove the theorem for the 2-colour case, by [[Mathematical induction|induction]] on ''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''s''. It is clear from the definition that for all ''n'', ''R''(''n'', 1) = ''R''(1, ''n'') = 1. This starts the induction. We prove that ''R''(''r'', ''s'') exists by finding an explicit bound for it. By the inductive hypothesis ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') and ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) exist.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Lemma 1.''' ''R''(''r'', ''s'') ≤ ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1):&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Proof.''' Consider a complete graph on ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) vertices whose edges are coloured with two colours. Pick a vertex ''v'' from the graph, and partition the remaining vertices into two sets ''M'' and ''N'', such that for every vertex ''w'', ''w'' is in ''M'' if (''v'', ''w'') is blue, and ''w'' is in ''N'' if (''v'', ''w'') is red. Because the graph has ''R''(''r'' − 1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s'' − 1) = |''M''| + |''N''| + 1 vertices, it follows that either |''M''| ≥ ''R''(''r'' − 1, ''s'') or |''N''| ≥ ''R''(''r'', ''s'' − 1). In the former case, if ''M'' has a red ''K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' then so does the original graph and we are finished. Otherwise ''M'' has a blue ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''r''−1&lt;/sub&gt; and so ''M'' ∪ {''v''} has blue ''K&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' by definition of ''M''. The latter case is analogous. Thus the claim is true and we have completed the proof for 2 colours.

'''Note.''' In the 2-colour case, if ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') and ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) are both even, the induction inequality can be strengthened to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Combinatorics/ThreeOrThree.shtml#inequality2 |title=Party Acquaintances}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''R''(''r'', ''s'') ≤ ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1.
'''Proof'''. Suppose '''''p=R(r&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, s)''''' and '''''q=R(r, s&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)''''' are both even. Let '''''t=p+q-1''''' and consider a two-coloured graph of '''''t''''' vertices. If &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; is degree of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th vertex in the blue subgraph, then, according to [[Handshaking lemma]], &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{i=1}^t d_i \displaystyle&lt;/math&gt;is even. Given that '''''t''''' is odd, there must be an even &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt;. Assume &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt;is even, ''M'' and ''N'' are the vertices incident to vertex 1 in blue and red subgraphs respectively. Then both &lt;math&gt;|M|=d_1&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;|N|=t-1-d_1&lt;/math&gt;are even. According to [[Pigeonhole principle]], either &lt;math&gt;|M| \ge p-1&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;N \ge q&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;|M|&lt;/math&gt; is even, while &lt;math&gt;p-1&lt;/math&gt; is odd, the first inequality can be strengthen, so either &lt;math&gt;|M|\ge p&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|N| \ge q&lt;/math&gt;.  Suppose &lt;math&gt;|M| \ge p = R(r-1,s)&lt;/math&gt;. Then either M-subgraph has a  red &lt;math&gt;K_s&lt;/math&gt;  and the proof is complete, or it has a blue &lt;math&gt;K_{r-1}&lt;/math&gt; which along with vertex 1 makes a  blue &lt;math&gt;K_r&lt;/math&gt; . Case &lt;math&gt;|N| \ge q=R(r,s-1)&lt;/math&gt; is treated similarly.

===Case of more colours===
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Lemma 2.''' If c&gt;2, then ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''−2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;)).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Proof.''' Consider a graph of ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''−2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;)) vertices and colour its edges with ''c'' colours. Now 'go colour-blind' and pretend that ''c''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 and ''c'' are the same colour. Thus the graph is now (''c''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-coloured. Due to the definition of ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''−2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;)), such a graph contains either a ''K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' mono-chromatically coloured with colour ''i'' for some 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''c''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2 or a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''R''(''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''c'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;-coloured in the 'blurred colour'. In the former case we are finished. In the latter case, we recover our sight again and see from the definition of ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;) we must have either a (''c''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-monochrome ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''c''−1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; or a ''c''-monochrome ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;. In either case the proof is complete.

Lemma 1 implies that any ''R(r,s)'' is finite. The right hand side of the inequality in Lemma 2 expresses a Ramsey number for  ''c'' colours  in terms of Ramsey numbers for fewer colours. Therefore any ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;) is finite for any number of colours. This proves the theorem.

==Ramsey numbers==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Unsolved problems in mathematics]] --&gt;
The numbers {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} in Ramsey's theorem (and their extensions to more than two colours) are known as Ramsey numbers. The Ramsey number, {{math|''R''(''m'', ''n'')}}, gives the solution to the party problem, which asks the minimum number of guests, {{math|''R''(''m'', ''n'')}}, that must be invited so that at least {{math|''m''}} will know each other or at least {{math|''n''}} will not know each other. In the language of graph theory, the Ramsey number is the minimum number of vertices, {{math|1=''v'' = ''R''(''m'', ''n'')}}, such that all undirected simple graphs of order {{math|''v''}}, contain a clique of order {{math|''m''}}, or an independent set of order {{math|''n''}}. Ramsey's theorem states that such a number exists for all {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''n''}}.

By symmetry, it is true that {{math|1=''R''(''m'', ''n'') = ''R''(''n'', ''m'')}}. An upper bound for {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} can be extracted from the proof of the theorem, and other arguments give lower bounds. (The first exponential lower bound was obtained by [[Paul Erdős]] using the [[probabilistic method]].) However, there is a vast gap between the tightest lower bounds and the tightest upper bounds. There are also very few numbers {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''s''}} for which we know the exact value of {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}}.

Computing a lower bound {{math|''L''}} for {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} usually requires exhibiting a blue/red colouring of the graph {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;''L''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}} with no blue {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}} subgraph and no red {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;}} subgraph. Such a counterexample is called a ''Ramsey graph''. [[Brendan McKay]] maintains a list of known Ramsey graphs.&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/ramsey.html|title=Ramsey Graphs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upper bounds are often considerably more difficult to establish: one either has to check all possible colourings to confirm the absence of a counterexample, or to present a mathematical argument for its absence. A sophisticated computer program does not need to look at all colourings individually in order to eliminate all of them; nevertheless it is a very difficult computational task that existing software can only manage on small sizes. Each complete graph {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} has {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}''n''(''n'' − 1)}} edges, so there would be a total of {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;{{sfrac|''n''(''n'' − 1)|2}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} graphs to search through (for {{math|''c''}} colours) if brute force is used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learner.org/channel/courses/mathilluminated/units/2/textbook/06.php 2.6 Ramsey Theory from Mathematics Illuminated]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the complexity for searching all possible graphs (via [[brute-force search|brute force]]) is {{math|[[Big O notation|O]](''c''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)}} for {{math|''c''}} colourings and an upper bound of {{mvar|n}} nodes.

As described above, {{math|1=''R''(3, 3) = 6}}. It is easy to prove that {{math|1=''R''(4, 2) = 4}}, and, more generally, that {{math|1=''R''(''s'', 2) = ''s''}} for all {{math|''s''}}: a graph on {{math|''s'' − 1}} nodes with all edges coloured red serves as a counterexample and proves that {{math|''R''(''s'', 2) ≥ ''s''}}; among colourings of a graph on {{math|''s''}} nodes, the colouring with all edges coloured red contains a {{math|''s''}}-node red subgraph, and all other colourings contain a {{math|2}}-node blue subgraph (that is, a pair of nodes connected with a blue edge.)

Using induction inequalities, it can be concluded that {{math|1=''R''(4, 3) ≤ ''R''(4, 2) + ''R''(3, 3) − 1 = 9}}, and therefore {{math|''R''(4, 4) ≤ ''R''(4, 3) + ''R''(3, 4) ≤ 18}}. There are only two {{math|(4, 4, 16)}} graphs (that is, {{math|2}}-colourings of a complete graph on {{math|16}} nodes without {{math|4}}-node red or blue complete subgraphs) among {{math|6.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;}} different {{math|2}}-colourings of {{math|16}}-node graphs, and only one {{math|(4, 4, 17)}} graph (the [[Paley graph]] of order {{math|17}}) among {{math|2.46 × 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;}} colourings.&lt;ref name=McKay /&gt; (This was proven by Evans, Pulham and Sheehan in 1979.) It follows that {{math|1=''R''(4, 4) = 18}}.

The fact that {{math|1=''R''(4, 5) = 25}} was first established by Brendan McKay and [[Stanisław Radziszowski]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=McKay1995&gt;{{cite journal|title=''R''(4,5) = 25|author=Brendan D. McKay, Stanislaw P. Radziszowski|journal=Journal of Graph Theory|date=May 1995|doi=10.1002/jgt.3190190304|volume=19|issue=3|pages=309–322|url = http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/papers/r45.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact value of {{math|''R''(5, 5)}} is unknown, although it is known to lie between {{math|43}} (Geoffrey Exoo (1989)) and {{math|48}} (Angeltveit and McKay (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |author1=Vigleik Angeltveit |author2=Brendan McKay |eprint=1703.08768v2 |title=&lt;math&gt;R(5,5) \leq 48&lt;/math&gt; |year= 2017 |class=math.CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;) (inclusive).

{{cquote|[[Paul Erdős|Erdős]] asks us to imagine an alien force, vastly more powerful than us, landing on Earth and demanding the value of {{math|''R''(5, 5)}} or they will destroy our planet. In that case, he claims, we should marshal all our computers and all our mathematicians and attempt to find the value. But suppose, instead, that they ask for {{math|''R''(6, 6)}}. In that case, he believes, we should attempt to destroy the aliens.|||[[Joel Spencer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ten Lectures on the Probabilistic Method|page=4|author=[[Joel H. Spencer]]|year=1994|publisher=[[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|SIAM]]|isbn=978-0-89871-325-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1997, McKay, Radziszowski and Exoo employed computer-assisted graph generation methods to conjecture that {{math|''R''(5, 5) {{=}} 43}}. They were able to construct exactly 656 {{math|(5, 5, 42)}} graphs, arriving at the same set of graphs through different routes. None of the 656 graphs can be extended to a {{math|(5, 5, 43)}} graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/papers/r55.pdf| title=Subgraph Counting Identities and Ramsey Numbers |author=Brendan D.

For {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} with {{math|''r'', ''s'' &gt; 5}}, only weak bounds are available. Lower bounds for {{math|''R''(6, 6)}} and {{math|''R''(8, 8)}} have not been improved since 1965 and 1972, respectively.&lt;ref name="bananas"/&gt;

{{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} with {{math|''r'', ''s'' ≤ 10}} are shown in the table below. Where the exact value is unknown, the table lists the best known bounds. {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} with {{math|''r'', ''s'' &lt; 3}} are given by {{math|1=''R''(1, ''s'') = 1}} and {{math|1=''R''(2, ''s'') = ''s''}} for all values of {{math|''s''}}. The standard survey on the development of Ramsey number research is the ''Dynamic Survey 1'' of the [[Electronic Journal of Combinatorics]].&lt;ref name="bananas"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/DS1/pdf | title = Dynamic survey of small Ramsey numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written and is updated by [[Stanisław Radziszowski]]. Its latest update was in March 2017. In general, there are a few years between the updates.
Where not cited otherwise, entries in the table below are taken from this dynamic survey. Note that since {{math|1=''R''(''r'', ''s'') = ''R''(''s'', ''r'')}}, there is a trivial symmetry across the diagonal.

==Asymptotics==
The inequality {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'') ≤ ''R''(''r'' − 1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s'' − 1)}} may be applied inductively to prove that
:&lt;math&gt;R(r, s) \leq \binom{r + s - 2}{r - 1}. &lt;/math&gt;

In particular, this result, due to [[Paul Erdős|Erdős]] and [[George Szekeres|Szekeres]], implies that when {{math|''r'' {{=}} ''s''}},
:&lt;math&gt;R(s, s) \leq [1 + o(1)]\frac{4^{s - 1}}{\sqrt{\pi s}}.&lt;/math&gt;

An exponential lower bound,
:&lt;math&gt;R(s, s) \geq [1 + o(1)] \frac{s}{\sqrt{2} e} 2^{s/2},&lt;/math&gt;

was given by Erdős in 1947 and was instrumental in his introduction of the probabilistic method. There is obviously a huge gap between these two bounds: for example, for {{math|''s'' {{=}} 10}}, this gives {{math|101 ≤ ''R''(10, 10) ≤ 48620}}. Nevertheless, exponential growth factors of either bound have not been improved to date and still stand at {{math|4}} and {{math|{{sqrt|2}}}} respectively. There is no known explicit construction producing an exponential lower bound. The best known lower and upper bounds for diagonal Ramsey numbers currently stand at
:&lt;math&gt;[1 + o(1)] \frac{\sqrt{2} s}{e} 2^{\frac{s}{2}} \leq R(s, s) \leq s^{-(c \log s)/(\log \log s)} 4^s,&lt;/math&gt;

due to [[Joel Spencer|Spencer]] and [[David Conlon|Conlon]] respectively.

For the off-diagonal Ramsey numbers {{math|''R''(3, ''t'')}}, it is known that they are of order &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{t^2}{\log t}&lt;/math&gt;; this may be stated equivalently as saying that the smallest possible [[Independent set (graph theory)|independence number]] in an {{mvar|n}}-vertex [[triangle-free graph]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\Theta \left (\sqrt{n\log n} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

The upper bound for {{math|''R''(3, ''t'')}} is given by [[Miklós Ajtai|Ajtai]], [[János Komlós (mathematician)|Komlós]], and [[Endre Szemerédi|Szemerédi]], the lower bound was obtained originally by [[Jeong Han Kim|Kim]], and was improved by Griffiths, [[Robert Morris (mathematician)|Morris]], Fiz Pontiveros, and [[Tom Bohman|Bohman]] and [[Peter Keevash|Keevash]], by analysing the triangle-free process. More generally, for off-diagonal Ramsey numbers, {{math|''R''(''s'', ''t'')}}, with {{mvar|s}} fixed and {{mvar|t}} growing, the best known bounds are
:&lt;math&gt;c'_s \frac{t^{\frac{s + 1}{2}}}{(\log t)^{\frac{s + 1}{2} - \frac{1}{s - 2}}} \leq R(s, t) \leq c_s \frac{t^{s - 1}}{(\log t)^{s - 2}},&lt;/math&gt;

due to Bohman and Keevash and [[Miklós Ajtai|Ajtai]], [[János Komlós (mathematician)|Komlós]] and [[Endre Szemerédi|Szemerédi]] respectively.

==A multicolour example: ''R''(3, 3, 3) = 17==
[[Image:K_16 partitioned into three Clebsch graphs.svg|right|thumb|The only two 3-colourings of K&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; with no monochromatic K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The untwisted colouring (above) and the twisted colouring (below).]]
[[Image:K_16 partitioned into three Clebsch graphs twisted.svg|right|thumb]]

A multicolour Ramsey number is a Ramsey number using 3 or more colours. There is (up to symmetries) only one non-trivial multicolour Ramsey number for which the exact value is known, namely ''R''(3, 3, 3)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;ref name="bananas"/&gt;

Suppose that we have an edge colouring of a complete graph using 3 colours, red, green and blue. Suppose further that the edge colouring has no monochromatic triangles. Select a vertex ''v''. Consider the set of vertices that have a red edge to the vertex ''v''. This is called the red neighbourhood of ''v''. The red neighbourhood of ''v'' cannot contain any red edges, since otherwise there would be a red triangle consisting of the two endpoints of that red edge and the vertex ''v''. Thus, the induced edge colouring on the red neighbourhood of ''v'' has edges coloured with only two colours, namely green and blue. Since ''R''(3, 3) = 6, the red neighbourhood of ''v'' can contain at most 5 vertices. Similarly, the green and blue neighbourhoods of ''v'' can contain at most 5 vertices each. Since every vertex, except for ''v'' itself, is in one of the red, green or blue neighbourhoods of ''v'', the entire complete graph can have at most 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 16 vertices. Thus, we have ''R''(3, 3, 3) ≤ 17.

To see that ''R''(3, 3, 3) ≥ 17, it suffices to draw an edge colouring on the complete graph on 16 vertices with 3 colours that avoids monochromatic triangles. It turns out that there are exactly two such colourings on ''K''&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;, the so-called untwisted and twisted colourings. Both colourings are shown in the figures to the right, with the untwisted colouring on the top, and the twisted colouring on the bottom.

[[Image:Clebsch graph.svg|thumb|right|[[Clebsch graph]]]]If we select any colour of either the untwisted or twisted colouring on ''K''&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;, and consider the graph whose edges are precisely those edges that have the specified colour, we will get the [[Clebsch graph]].

It is known that there are exactly two edge colourings with 3 colours on ''K''&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; that avoid monochromatic triangles, which can be constructed by deleting any vertex from the untwisted and twisted colourings on ''K''&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

It is also known that there are exactly 115 edge colourings with 3 colours on ''K''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; that avoid monochromatic triangles, provided that we consider edge colourings that differ by a permutation of the colours as being the same.

==Extensions of the theorem==
The theorem can also be extended to [[hypergraph]]s. An ''m''-hypergraph is a graph whose "edges" are sets of ''m'' vertices – in a normal graph an edge is a set of 2 vertices. The full statement of Ramsey's theorem for hypergraphs is that for any integers ''m'' and ''c'', and any integers ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;, there is an integer ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;;''c'', ''m'') such that if the hyperedges of a complete ''m''-hypergraph of order ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;;''c'', ''m'') are coloured with ''c'' different colours, then for some ''i'' between 1 and ''c'', the hypergraph must contain a complete sub-''m''-hypergraph of order ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; whose hyperedges are all colour ''i''. This theorem is usually proved by induction on ''m'', the 'hyper-ness' of the graph. The base case for the proof is ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, which is exactly the theorem above.

==Infinite Ramsey theorem==
A further result, also commonly called ''Ramsey's theorem'', applies to infinite graphs. In a context where finite graphs are also being discussed it is often called the "Infinite Ramsey theorem". As intuition provided by the pictorial representation of a graph is diminished when moving from finite to infinite graphs, theorems in this area are usually phrased in [[set theory|set-theoretic]] terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/~gouldm/ramsey.pdf|format=pdf|title=Ramsey Theory|author=Martin Gould}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem.''' Let ''X'' be some infinite set and colour the elements of ''X''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt; (the subsets of ''X'' of size ''n'') in ''c'' different colours. Then there exists some infinite subset ''M'' of ''X'' such that the size ''n'' subsets of ''M'' all have the same colour.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Proof''': The proof is by induction on ''n'', the size of the subsets. For ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the statement is equivalent to saying that if you split an infinite set into a finite number of sets, then one of them is infinite. This is evident. Assuming the theorem is true for ''n'' ≤ ''r'', we prove it for ''n'' = ''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. Given a ''c''-colouring of the (''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-element subsets of ''X'', let ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be an element of ''X'' and let ''Y'' = ''X''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;{''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}. We then induce a ''c''-colouring of the ''r''-element subsets of ''Y'', by just adding ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to each ''r''-element subset (to get an (''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-element subset of ''X''). By the induction hypothesis, there exists an infinite subset ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of ''Y'' such that every ''r''-element subset of ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is coloured the same colour in the induced colouring. Thus there is an element ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and an infinite subset ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; such that all the (''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-element subsets of ''X'' consisting of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r'' elements of ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; have the same colour. By the same argument, there is an element ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and an infinite subset ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with the same properties. Inductively, we obtain a sequence {''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …} such that the colour of each (''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-element subset (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''(1)&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''(2)&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''(''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;/sub&gt;) with ''i''(1) &lt; ''i''(2) &lt; ... &lt; ''i''(''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) depends only on the value of ''i''(1). Further, there are infinitely many values of ''i''(''n'') such that this colour will be the same. Take these ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''(''n'')&lt;/sub&gt;'s to get the desired monochromatic set.

==Infinite version implies the finite==
It is possible to deduce the finite Ramsey theorem from the infinite version by a [[proof by contradiction]]. Suppose the finite Ramsey theorem is false. Then there exist integers ''c'', ''n'', ''T'' such that for every integer ''k'', there exists a ''c''-colouring of &lt;math&gt;[k]^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; without a monochromatic set of size ''T''. Let ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the ''c''-colourings of &lt;math&gt;[k]^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; without a monochromatic set of size ''T''.

For any ''k'', the restriction of a colouring in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; to &lt;math&gt;[k]^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; (by ignoring the colour of all sets containing ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) is a colouring in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt;C^1_k&lt;/math&gt; to be the colourings in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; which are restrictions of colourings in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;. Since ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; is not empty, neither is &lt;math&gt;C^{1}_k&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, the restriction of any colouring in &lt;math&gt;C^1_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;C^1_k&lt;/math&gt;, allowing one to define &lt;math&gt;C^2_k&lt;/math&gt; as the set of all such restrictions, a non-empty set. Continuing so, define &lt;math&gt;C^{m}_k&lt;/math&gt; for all integers ''m'', ''k''.

Now, for any integer ''k'', &lt;math&gt;C_k\supseteq C^1_k\supseteq C^2_k\supseteq \cdots&lt;/math&gt;, and each set is non-empty. Furthermore, ''C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is finite as &lt;math&gt;|C_k|\le c^{\frac{k!}{n!(k-n)!}}&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that the intersection of all of these sets is non-empty, and let &lt;math&gt;D_k=C_k\cap C^1_k\cap C^2_k\cap \cdots&lt;/math&gt;. Then every colouring in ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the restriction of a colouring in ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore, by unrestricting a colouring in ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; to a colouring in ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, and continuing doing so, one constructs a colouring of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; without any monochromatic set of size ''T''. This contradicts the infinite Ramsey theorem.

If a suitable topological viewpoint is taken, this argument becomes a standard [[compactness theorem|compactness argument]] showing that the infinite version of the theorem implies the finite version.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Graph Theory|last=Diestel|first=Reinhard|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2010|isbn=978-3-662-53621-6|edition=4|location=Heidelberg|pages=209--2010|chapter=Chapter 8, Infinite Graphs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directed graph Ramsey numbers==
It is also possible to define Ramsey numbers for ''directed'' graphs. (These were introduced by [[Paul Erdős|P. Erdős]] &amp; L. Moser.) Let ''R''(''n'') be the smallest number ''Q'' such that any complete graph with singly directed arcs (also called a "tournament") and with ≥&amp;nbsp;''Q'' nodes contains an acyclic (also called "transitive") ''n''-node subtournament.

This is the directed-graph analogue of what (above) has been called ''R''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''n'';&amp;nbsp;2), the smallest number ''Z'' such that any 2-colouring of the edges of a complete ''un''directed graph with ≥&amp;nbsp;''Z'' nodes, contains a monochromatic complete graph on n nodes. (The directed analogue of the two possible arc ''colours'' is the two ''directions'' of the arcs, the analogue of "monochromatic" is "all arc-arrows point the same way"; i.e., "acyclic.")

We have ''R''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''R''(1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''R''(2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''R''(3)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, ''R''(4)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8, ''R''(5)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;14, ''R''(6)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;28, 32&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''R''(7)&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;55, and ''R''(8) is again a problem, according to Erdős{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}, that one does not want powerful aliens to pose.

==Ramsey computation and quantum computers==
Ramsey numbers can be determined by some universal quantum computers. The decision question is solved by determining whether the probe qubit exhibits resonance dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01884&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''recursive neural network''' (RNN) is a kind of [[deep learning#Deep neural networks|deep neural network]] created by applying the same set of weights [[recursion|recursively]] over a structured input, to produce a [[structured prediction]] over variable-size input structures, or a scalar prediction on it, by traversing a given structure in [[topological sort|topological order]]. RNNs have been successful, for instance, in learning sequence and tree structures in [[natural language processing]], mainly phrase and sentence continuous representations based on [[word embedding]]. RNNs have first been introduced to learn [[distributed representation]]s of structure, such as [[mathematical logic|logical terms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/ICNN.1996.548916|title=Learning task-dependent distributed representations by backpropagation through structure|last1=Goller|first1=C.|last2=Küchler|first2=A.|journal=Neural Networks, 1996., IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Models and general frameworks have been developed in further works since the 90s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sperduti|first=A.|last2=Starita|first2=A.|date=1997-05-01|title=Supervised neural networks for the classification of structures|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/572108/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks|volume=8|issue=3|pages=714–735|doi=10.1109/72.572108|issn=1045-9227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frasconi|first=P.|last2=Gori|first2=M.|last3=Sperduti|first3=A.|date=1998-09-01|title=A general framework for adaptive processing of data structures|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/712151/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks|volume=9|issue=5|pages=768–786|doi=10.1109/72.712151|issn=1045-9227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architectures ==

=== Basic ===
[[File:Simple recursive neural network.svg|thumbnail|A simple recursive neural network architecture]]

In the most simple architecture, nodes are combined into parents using a weight matrix that is shared across the whole network, and a non-linearity such as ''[[tanh]]''. If ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are ''n''-dimensional vector representation of nodes, their parent will also be an ''n''-dimensional vector, calculated as

&lt;math&gt;p_{1,2} = \tanh\left(W[c_1 ; c_2]\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''W'' is a learned &lt;math&gt;n\times 2n&lt;/math&gt; weight matrix.

This architecture, with a few improvements, has been used for successfully parsing natural scenes and for syntactic parsing of natural language sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Socher|first1=Richard|last2=Lin|first2=Cliff|last3=Ng|first3=Andrew Y.|last4=Manning|first4=Christopher D.|title=Parsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural Networks|journal=The 28th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2011)|url=http://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/SocherLinNgManning_ICML2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recurrent Neural Networks ===
{{Main|Recurrent Neural Network}}
[[Recurrent neural network]]s are recursive [[artificial neural network]]s with a certain structure: that of a linear chain. Whereas recursive neural networks operate on any hierarchical structure, combining child representations into parent representations, recurrent neural networks operate on the linear progression of time, combining the previous time step and a hidden representation into the representation for the current time step.

'''Robert Gardner Bartle''' (1927 – 2003) was an American [[mathematician]] specializing in [[real analysis]]. He is known for writing the popular [[textbook]]s ''The Elements of Real Analysis'' (1964), ''The Elements of Integration'' (1966), and ''Introduction to Real Analysis'' (2011) published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]. 

Bartle was born in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and was the son of Glenn G. Bartle and Wanda M. Bartle.
He was married to Doris Sponenberg Bartle (born 1927) from 1952 to 1982 and they had two sons, James A. Bartle (born 1955) and John R. Bartle (born 1958). He was on the faculty of the Department of Mathematics at the [[University of Illinois]] from 1955 to 1990.

Bartle was Executive Editor of ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' from 1976 to 1978 and from 1986 to 1990. From 1990 to 1999 he taught at [[Eastern Michigan University]]. In 1997, he earned a writing award from the [[Mathematical Association of America]] for his paper "Return to the Riemann Integral".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert G.|last=Bartle|author-link=Robert G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3176">In mathematics, a '''Schur-convex function''', also known as '''S-convex''', '''isotonic function''' and '''order-preserving function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; that for all &lt;math&gt;x,y\in \mathbb{R}^d &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is [[majorization|majorized]] by &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, one has that &lt;math&gt;f(x)\le f(y)&lt;/math&gt;. Named after [[Issai Schur]], Schur-convex functions are used in the study of [[majorization]]. Every function that is [[Convex function|convex]] and [[Symmetric function|symmetric]] is also Schur-convex.  The opposite [[Strict conditional|implication]] is not  true, but all Schur-convex functions are symmetric (under permutations of the arguments).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=A. Wayne|last2=Varberg|first2=Dale E.|title=Convex functions|date=1973|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=9780080873725|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schur-concave function ==
A function ''f'' is 'Schur-concave' if its negative, -''f'', is Schur-convex.

== Schur-Ostrowski criterion==

If ''f'' is symmetric and all first partial derivatives exist, then 
''f'' is Schur-convex if and only if

&lt;math&gt;(x_i - x_j)\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}\right) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;

holds for all 1≤''i''≠''j''≤''d''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=E. Peajcariaac|first1=Josip|last2=L. Tong|first2=Y.|title=Convex Functions, Partial Orderings, and Statistical Applications|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780080925226|page=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* &lt;math&gt; f(x)=\min(x) &lt;/math&gt; is Schur-concave while &lt;math&gt; f(x)=\max(x) &lt;/math&gt; is Schur-convex. This can be seen directly from the definition.
* The [[Shannon entropy]] function &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^d{P_i \cdot \log_2{\frac{1}{P_i}}}&lt;/math&gt; is Schur-concave.
* The [[Rényi entropy]] function is also Schur-concave.
* &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^d{x_i^k},k \ge 1 &lt;/math&gt; is Schur-convex.
* The function &lt;math&gt; f(x) = \prod_{i=1}^n x_i  &lt;/math&gt; is Schur-concave, when we assume all &lt;math&gt; x_i &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;. In the same way, all the [[Elementary symmetric polynomial|Elementary symmetric function]]s are Schur-concave, when &lt;math&gt; x_i &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;.
* A natural interpretation of [[majorization]] is that if &lt;math&gt; x \succ y &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is less spread out than &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt;. So it is natural to ask if statistical measures of variability are Schur-convex. The [[variance]] and [[standard deviation]] are Schur-convex functions, while the [[Median absolute deviation]] is not.
* If &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt; is a convex function defined on a real interval, then &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n g(x_i) &lt;/math&gt; is Schur-convex.
* A probability example: If  &lt;math&gt; X_1, \dots, X_n &lt;/math&gt; are [[exchangeable random variables]], then the function &lt;math&gt;  \text{E} \prod_{j=1}^n X_j^{a_j} &lt;/math&gt; is Schur-convex as a function of &lt;math&gt; a=(a_1, \dots, a_n) &lt;/math&gt;, assuming that the expectations exist.
* The [[Gini coefficient]] is strictly Schur convex.

In mathematics, a '''Sierpiński set''' is an uncountable subset of a real vector space whose intersection with every measure-zero set is countable. The existence of Sierpiński sets is independent of the axioms of ZFC. {{harvs|txt|last=Sierpiński|year=1924|authorlink=Wacław Sierpiński}} showed that they exist if the [[continuum hypothesis]] is true.  On the other hand, they do not exist if [[Martin's axiom]] for ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is true. Sierpiński sets are weakly Luzin sets but are not [[Luzin set]]s {{harv|Kunen|2011|loc=p. 376}}.

==Example of a Sierpiński set==

Choose a collection of 2&lt;sup&gt;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; measure 0 subsets of '''R''' such that every measure 0 subset is contained in one of them. By the continuum hypothesis, it is possible to enumerate them as ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt; for countable ordinals α. For each countable ordinal ''β'' choose a real number ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''β''&lt;/sub&gt; that is not in any of the sets ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''α''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''β'', which is possible as the union of these sets has measure 0 so is not the whole of '''R'''. Then the uncountable set ''X'' of all these real numbers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''β''&lt;/sub&gt; has only a countable number of elements in each set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;, so is a Sierpiński set.

It is possible for a Sierpiński set to be a subgroup under addition. For this one modifies the construction above by choosing a real number ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''β''&lt;/sub&gt; that is not in any of the countable number of sets of the form (''S''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''X'')/''n'' for ''α''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''β'', where ''n'' is a positive integer and ''X'' is an integral linear combination of the numbers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''α''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''β''. Then the group generated by these numbers is a Sierpiński set and a group under addition. More complicated variations of this construction produce examples of Sierpiński sets that are subfields or real-closed subfields of the real numbers.

In mathematics, the '''stretch factor''' of an [[embedding]] measures the factor by which the embedding distorts [[distance]]s.
Suppose that one [[metric space]] {{mvar|S}} is embedded into another metric space {{mvar|T}} by a [[metric map]], a continuous one-to-one function {{mvar|f}} that preserves or reduces the distance between every pair of points. Then the embedding gives rise to two different notions of distance between pairs of points in {{mvar|S}}. Any pair of points {{math|(''x'',''y'')}} in {{mvar|S}} has both an [[intrinsic metric|intrinsic distance]], the distance from {{mvar|x}} to {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|S}}, and a smaller extrinsic distance, the distance from {{math|''f''(''x'')}} to {{math|''f''(''y'')}} in {{mvar|T}}. The stretch factor of the pair is the ratio between these two distances, {{math|''d''(''x'',''y'')/''d''(''f''(''x''),''f''(''y''))}}. The stretch factor of the whole mapping is the [[supremum]] (if it exists) of the stretch factors of all pairs of points. The stretch factor has also been called the '''distortion''' or '''dilation''' of the mapping.

The stretch factor is important in the theory of [[geometric spanner]]s, [[weighted graph]]s that approximate the [[Euclidean distance]]s between a set of points in the [[Euclidean plane]]. In this case, the embedded metric {{mvar|S}} is a finite metric space, whose distances are [[Shortest path problem|shortest path lengths]] in a graph, and the metric {{mvar|T}} into which {{mvar|S}} is embedded is the Euclidean plane. When the graph and its embedding are fixed, but the graph edge weights can vary, the stretch factor is minimized when the weights are exactly the Euclidean distances between the edge endpoints. Research in this area has focused on finding [[sparse graph]]s for a given point set that have low stretch factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Giri|last1=Narasimhan|first2=Michiel|last2=Smid|title=Geometric Spanner Networks|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2007|isbn=0-521-81513-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma]] asserts that any finite metric space with {{mvar|n}} points can be embedded into a Euclidean space of dimension {{math|''O''(log&amp;nbsp;''n'')}} with distortion {{math|1 + ''&amp;epsilon;''}}, for any constant {{math|''&amp;epsilon;'' &gt; 0}}, where the constant factor in the {{mvar|O}}-notation depends on the choice of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|&amp;epsilon;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In [[knot theory]], the distortion of a knot is a [[knot invariant]], the minimum stretch factor of any embedding of the knot as a [[space curve]] in [[Euclidean space]].
Undergraduate researcher [[John Pardon]] won the 2012 [[Morgan Prize]] for his research showing that there is no upper bound on the distortion of [[torus knot]]s, solving a problem originally posed by [[Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov|Mikhail Gromov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=2012 Morgan Prize|journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]|date=April 2012|doi=10.1090/noti825|pages=569–571|volume=59|issue=4|first=Elaine|last=Kehoe}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In the study of the [[curve-shortening flow]], in which each point of a curve in the Euclidean plane moves perpendicularly to the curve, with speed proportional to the local curvature, {{harvtxt|Huisken|1998}} proved that the stretch factor of any simple closed smooth curve (with intrinsic distances measured by arc length) changes monotonically. More specifically, at each pair {{math|(''x'',''y'')}} that forms a local maximum of the stretch factor, the stretch factor is strictly decreasing, except when the curve is a circle. This property was later used to simplify the proof of the Gage–Hamilton–Grayson theorem, according to which every simple closed smooth curve stays simple and smooth until it collapses to a point, converging in shape to a circle before doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3118">In [[numerical analysis]], '''transfinite interpolation''' is a means to construct [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] over a planar domain in such a way that they match a given function on the boundary. This method is applied in [[geometric model]]ling and in the field of [[finite element method]].&lt;ref name="Dyken2009"/&gt;

The transfinite interpolation method, first introduced by William J. Gordon and Charles A. Hall,&lt;ref name="Hall73"/&gt; receives its name due to how a function belonging to this class is able to match the primitive function at a nondenumerable number of points.&lt;ref name="Gordon82"/&gt;
In the authors' words:
{{centered pull quote| We use the term ‘transfinite’ to describe the general class of interpolation schemes studied herein since, unlike the classical methods of higher dimensional interpolation which match the primitive function F at a finite number of distinct points, these methods match F at a non-denumerable (transfinite) number of points.}}

Transfinite interpolation is similar to the [[Coons patch]], invented in 1967. &lt;ref name="coons"&gt;Steven A. Coons, Surfaces for computer-aided design of space forms, Technical Report MAC-TR-41, Project MAC, MIT, June 1967.  &lt;/ref&gt;



== Formula ==

With parametrized curves &lt;math&gt;\vec{c}_1(u)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\vec{c}_3(u)&lt;/math&gt; describing one pair of opposite sides of a domain, and
&lt;math&gt;\vec{c}_2(v)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\vec{c}_4(v)&lt;/math&gt; describing the other pair. the position of point (u,v) in the domain is

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcl}
\vec{S}(u,v)&amp;=&amp;(1-v)\vec{c}_1(u)+v\vec{c}_3(u)+(1-u)\vec{c}_2(v)+u\vec{c}_4(v)\\
&amp;&amp; -
\left[
(1-u)(1-v)\vec{P}_{1,2}+uv\vec{P}_{3,4}+u(1-v)\vec{P}_{1,4}+(1-u)v\vec{P}_{3,2}
\right]
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

where, e.g., &lt;math&gt;\vec{P}_{1,2}&lt;/math&gt; is the point where curves &lt;math&gt;\vec{c}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{c}_2&lt;/math&gt; meet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10583">In [[mathematics]], the '''uniform boundedness principle''' or '''Banach–Steinhaus theorem''' is one of the fundamental results in [[functional analysis]]. Together with the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] and the [[open mapping theorem (functional analysis)|open mapping theorem]], it is considered one of the cornerstones of the field.  In its basic form, it asserts that for a family of [[continuous linear operator]]s (and thus bounded operators) whose domain is a [[Banach space]], pointwise boundedness is equivalent to uniform boundedness in operator norm.

The theorem was first published in 1927 by [[Stefan Banach]] and [[Hugo Steinhaus]] but it was also proven independently by [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]].

==Theorem==
'''Theorem (Uniform Boundedness Principle).''' Let ''X''  and ''Y'' be [[Banach space]]s. Suppose that ''F'' is a collection of continuous linear operators from ''X'' to ''Y''. If for all ''x'' in ''X'' one has

:&lt;math&gt;\sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|T(x)\|_Y  &lt; \infty, &lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\sup\nolimits_{T \in F,\|x\|=1} \|T(x)\|_Y=\sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|T\|_{B(X,Y)}  &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
The completeness of ''X'' enables the following short proof, using the [[Baire category theorem]].

'''Proof.''' Suppose that for every ''x'' in the Banach space ''X'', one has:

:&lt;math&gt;\sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|T (x)\|_Y  &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

For every integer &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, let

:&lt;math&gt; X_n = \left  \{x \in X \ : \ \sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|T (x)\|_Y \le n \right \}. &lt;/math&gt;

The set &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[closed set]] and by the assumption,

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup\nolimits_{n \in \mathbf{N}} X_n = X \neq \varnothing.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[Baire category theorem]] for the non-empty [[complete metric space]]&amp;nbsp;''X'', there exists ''m'' such that 
&lt;math&gt; X_m&lt;/math&gt; has non-empty [[Interior (topology)|interior]], ''i.e.'', there exist &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in X_m&lt;/math&gt; and {{nowrap|ε &amp;gt; 0}} such that

:&lt;math&gt; \overline{B_\varepsilon (x_0)} := \{x \in X \,:\, \|x - x_0\| \le \varepsilon \} \subseteq  X_m.&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''u'' ∈ ''X'' with {{nowrap|ǁ''u''ǁ &amp;le; 1}} and {{nowrap|''T'' ∈ ''F''}}.  One has that:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\|T(u) \|_Y &amp;= \varepsilon^{-1} \left \|T \left( x_0 + \varepsilon u \right) - T(x_0) \right \|_Y    &amp; [\text{by linearity of } T ] \\
&amp;\leq \varepsilon^{-1} \left ( \left\| T (x_0 + \varepsilon u) \right\|_Y + \left\| T (x_0) \right\|_Y \right ) \\
&amp;\leq \varepsilon^{-1} (m + m).   &amp; [ \text{since} \ x_0 + \varepsilon u, \ x_0 \in X_m ] \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the supremum over ''u'' in the unit ball of&amp;nbsp;''X'' and over &lt;math&gt;T\in F&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that

:&lt;math&gt; \sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|T\|_{B(X,Y)}  \leq 2 \varepsilon^{-1} m &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

There are also simple proofs not using the Baire theorem {{harv|Sokal|2011}}.

==Corollaries==
'''Corollary.''' If a sequence of bounded operators (''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') converges pointwise, that is, the limit of {''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')} exists for all ''x'' in ''X'', then these pointwise limits define a bounded operator ''T''.

Note it is not claimed above that ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges to ''T'' in operator norm, i.e. uniformly on bounded sets. (However, since {''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} is bounded in operator norm, and the limit operator ''T'' is continuous, a standard [[3-epsilon estimate|"3-ε" estimate]] shows that ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges to ''T'' uniformly on ''compact'' sets.)

'''Corollary.''' Any weakly bounded subset S in a normed space Y is bounded.''

Indeed, the elements of ''S'' define a pointwise bounded family of continuous linear forms on the Banach space ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Y*'', continuous dual of ''Y''.  By the uniform boundedness principle, the norms of elements of ''S'', as functionals on ''X'', that is, norms in the second dual ''Y**'', are bounded.  But for every ''s'' in ''S'', the norm in the second dual coincides with the norm in ''Y'', by a consequence of the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]].

Let ''L''(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'') denote the continuous operators from ''X'' to ''Y'', with the operator norm. If the collection ''F'' is unbounded in ''L''(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y''), then by the uniform boundedness principle, we have:

:&lt;math&gt; R = \left \{ x \in X  \ : \ \sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|Tx\|_Y = \infty \right \} \neq \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, ''R'' is dense in ''X''. The complement of ''R'' in ''X'' is the countable union of closed sets &amp;cup;''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. By the argument used in proving the theorem, each ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[nowhere dense]], i.e. the subset &amp;cup;''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''of first category''. Therefore ''R'' is the complement of a subset of first category in a  Baire space. By definition of a Baire space, such sets (called ''residual sets'') are dense. Such reasoning leads to the '''principle of condensation of singularities''', which can be formulated as follows:

'''Theorem.''' Let ''X'' be a Banach space, {''Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} a sequence of normed vector spaces, and ''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' a unbounded family in ''L''(''X'', ''Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''). Then the set

:&lt;math&gt; R = \left \{ x \in X \ : \ \forall n \in \mathbf{N} : \sup\nolimits_{T \in F_n} \|Tx\|_{Y_n} = \infty \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

is of second category, and thus dense in ''X''.

'''Proof.''' The complement of ''R'' is the countable union

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup\nolimits_{n,m} \left \{ x \in X \ : \ \sup\nolimits_{T \in F_n} \|Tx\|_{Y_n} \le m \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

of sets of first category. Therefore its residual set ''R'' is dense.

==Example: pointwise convergence of Fourier series==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[circle group|circle]], and let &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt; be the Banach space of continuous functions on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;, with the [[uniform norm]]. Using the uniform boundedness principle, one can show that there exists an element in &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt; for which the Fourier series does not converge pointwise.

For &lt;math&gt;f \in C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt;, its [[Fourier series]] is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k \in \mathbf{Z}} \hat{f}(k) e^{ikx} = \sum_{k \in \mathbf{Z}}\frac{1}{2\pi} \left (\int_0 ^{2 \pi} f(t) e^{-ikt} dt \right) e^{ikx},&lt;/math&gt;

and the ''N''-th symmetric partial sum is

:&lt;math&gt; S_N(f)(x) = \sum_{k=-N}^N \hat{f}(k) e^{ikx} =  \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0 ^{2 \pi} f(t) D_N(x - t) \, dt,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''N''-th [[Dirichlet kernel]]. Fix &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; and consider the convergence of {''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''(''f'')(''x'')}.  The functional φ&lt;sub&gt;''N,x''&lt;/sub&gt; : &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})\rightarrow \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{N, x} (f) =  S_N(f)(x), \qquad f \in C(\mathbb{T}),&lt;/math&gt;

is bounded.  The norm of φ&lt;sub&gt;''N,x''&lt;/sub&gt;, in the dual of &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt;, is the norm of the signed measure (2π)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''D''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''−''t'')&amp;nbsp;d''t'', namely

:&lt;math&gt; \left \| \varphi_{N,x} \right \| =  \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0 ^{2 \pi} \left | D_N(x-t) \right  | \, dt =  \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0 ^{2 \pi} \left | D_N(s) \right  | \, ds = \left \|  D_N \right \|_{L^1(\mathbb{T})}.&lt;/math&gt;

One can verify that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0 ^{2 \pi} | D_N(t) | \, dt \ge \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\left |\sin\left ( (N+\tfrac{1}{2})t \right )\right|}{t/2} \, dt \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

So the collection {φ&lt;sub&gt;''N,x''&lt;/sub&gt;} is unbounded in &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})^\ast&lt;/math&gt;, the dual of &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore by the uniform boundedness principle, for any &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;, the set of continuous functions whose Fourier series diverges at ''x'' is dense in &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt;.

More can be concluded by applying the principle of condensation of singularities. Let {''x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''} be a dense sequence in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;. Define φ&lt;sub&gt;''N,x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sub&gt; in the similar way as above. The principle of condensation of singularities then says that the set of continuous functions whose Fourier series diverges at each ''x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is dense in &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt; (however, the Fourier series of a continuous function ''f'' converges to ''f''(''x'') for almost every &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;, by [[Carleson's theorem]]).

== Generalisations ==
The least restrictive setting for the uniform boundedness principle is a [[barrelled space]] where the following generalised version of the theorem holds {{harv|Bourbaki|1987|loc=Theorem III.2.1}}:

'''Theorem.''' Given a barrelled space ''X'' and a [[locally convex space]] ''Y'', then any family of pointwise bounded [[continuous linear mapping]]s from ''X'' to ''Y'' is [[equicontinuous]] (even [[uniformly equicontinuous]]).

Alternatively, the statement also holds whenever ''X'' is a [[Baire space]] and ''Y'' is a locally convex space {{harv|Shtern|2001}}.

{{harvtxt|Dieudonné|1970}} proves a weaker form of this theorem with [[Fréchet space]]s rather than the usual Banach spaces.  Specifically,

'''Theorem.''' Let ''X'' be a Fréchet space, ''Y'' a normed space, and ''H'' a set of continuous linear mappings of ''X'' into ''Y''.  If for every ''x'' in ''X''
:&lt;math&gt;\sup\nolimits_{u\in H}\|u(x)\|&lt;\infty,&lt;/math&gt; 
then the family ''H'' is equicontinuous.
