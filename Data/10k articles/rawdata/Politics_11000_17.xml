      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1048">The '''Agrarian Party''' (originally ''Alliance of Agrarians'') was a political party within the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] and later the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. It was formed in 1919.

The party originally operated on the whole territory of the state, but in areas with a [[Croat]]ian majority, the party merged into the [[Croatian Peasant Party]]. A splinter party later emerged called the [[National Peasant Party (Yugoslavia)|National Peasant Party]] of [[Dragoljub Jovanović]]. 

The party was later banned by the [[Communist Yugoslavia|Communist Yugoslav]] authorities.

{{Territorial evolution of Germany}}

'''''Anschluss''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʔanʃlʊs|lang|De-Anschluss.ogg}} "joining") refers to the [[annexation]] of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] into [[Nazi Germany]] on 12 March 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/26730/Anschluss "Anschluss"]. ''Britannica''. Retrieved 2014-21-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The word's German spelling, until the [[German orthography reform of 1996]], was  '''''Anschluß'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.pons.eu/german-english/Anschluss Anschluss] PONS Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; and it was also known as the '''''Anschluss Österreichs''''' ({{Audio|De-Anschluss_Österreichs.ogg|pronunciation}}, {{lang-de|Annexation of Austria}}).

{{Events leading to World War II}}

Prior to the ''Anschluss'', there had been strong support from people of all backgrounds &amp;ndash; not just Nazis &amp;ndash; in both Austria and Germany for a union of the two countries.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=11}} The desire for a union formed an integral part of the Nazi ''"[[Heim ins Reich]]"'' movement to bring ethnic Germans outside Nazi Germany into [[Pan-Germanism|Greater Germany]].{{sfn|Shirer|1984}} Earlier, Nazi Germany had provided support for the [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian National Socialist Party]] (Austrian Nazi Party) in its bid to seize power from Austria's [[Austrofascism|Fatherland Front]] government.

The idea of an ''Anschluss'' (a united Austria and Germany that would form a "[[German Question|Greater Germany]]"){{efn|After the Prussian-dominated German nation-state was created in 1871 without Austria, the German question was still very active in most parts of the ethnic German lands of the Austro-Hungarian and German empires; the Austrian pan-Germans were in favour of a Pan-German vision of Austria joining Germany in order to create a "Greater Germany" and the Germans inside the German Empire were in favour of all Germans being unified into a single state.{{sfn|Low|1974|p=3}}}} began after the [[unification of Germany]] excluded Austria and the German Austrians from the Prussian-dominated [[German Empire]] in 1871. Following the end of [[World War I]] with the fall of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], in 1918, the newly formed [[Republic of German-Austria]] attempted to form a union with Germany, but the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint Germain]] (10 September 1919) and the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (28 June 1919) forbade both the union and the continued use of the name "German-Austria" (''Deutschösterreich''); and stripped Austria of some of its territories, such as the [[Sudetenland]].

==Historical background==
[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.65|&lt;center&gt;The [[German Confederation]] 1815-1866&lt;/center&gt;]]
{{Main article|Holy Roman Empire of the German nation|German Confederation|German question|German Empire|German nationalism in Austria}}

The idea of grouping all [[Ethnic Germans|Germans]] into a nation-state country had been the subject of debate in the 19th century from the ending of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806 until the ending of the [[German Confederation]] in 1866. Austria had wanted a ''[[Großdeutsche Lösung]]'' (greater Germany solution), whereby the German states would unite under the leadership of the German Austrians ([[House of Habsburg |Habsburgs]]). This solution would have included all the German states (including the non-German regions of Austria), but Prussia would have had to take second place. This controversy, called [[Austria–Prussia rivalry|dualism]], dominated Prusso-Austrian diplomacy and the politics of the German states in the mid-nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Blackbourn|Blackbourn, David]] (1997) ''The Long Nineteenth Century: A History of Germany, 1780-1918'' New York: HarperCollins. pp.160–175. {{isbn|0002556774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866 the feud finally came to an end during the [[Austro-Prussian War|German war]] in which the Prussians successfully defeated the Austrians and thereby excluded Austria and the German Austrians from Germany. The Prussian statesman [[Otto von Bismarck]] formed the [[North German Confederation]], which included the remaining German states and further expanded the power of Prussia. Bismarck used the [[Franco-Prussian war]] (1870-1871) as a way to convince other German states, including the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], to side with Prussia against the [[Second French Empire]]. Due to Prussia's quick victory, the debate was settled and in 1871 the "''Kleindeutsch''" [[German Empire]] based on the leadership of Bismarck and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] formed - this excluded Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Sheehan, James J.|authorlink= James J. Sheehan|title= German History, 1770–1866|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TAEj4vtFR3AC&amp;pg=PA851|year= 1993|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the ''Ausgleich'', provided for a dual sovereignty, the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], under [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]]. The Austrian-Hungarian rule of this diverse empire included various different ethnic groups including Hungarians, Slavic ethnic groups such as Croats, Czechs, Poles, Rusyns, Serbs, Slovaks, Slovenes, and Ukrainians, as well as Italians and Romanians ruled by a German minority.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. J. P. Taylor|Taylor, A. J. P.]] (1964) ''The Habsburg monarchy, 1809–1918: A History of the Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary'' (2nd ed.) ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The empire caused tensions between the various ethnic groups. Many Austrian pan-Germans showed loyalty to [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Suppan |title=′Germans′ in the Habsburg Empire | work=The Germans and the East | year=2008 | pages=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only to Germany, wore symbols that were temporarily banned in Austrian schools and advocated the dissolution of the empire to allow an annexation of Austria to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Daniel L. |last=Unowsky |title=The Pomp and Politics of Patriotism: Imperial Celebrations in Habsburg Austria, 1848–1916 |publisher=Purdue University Press |year=2005 |page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Eva |last=Giloi |title=Monarchy, Myth, and Material Culture in Germany 1750–1950 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |pages=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many Austrians agreed with pan-Germanism ideas, a lot of them still showed allegiance to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and wished for Austria to remain an independent country.{{sfn|Low|1974|pp=14-16}} After the Nazis gained power in Germany in 1933, they used [[Nazi propaganda|propaganda]] to try to coerce Austrians into advocating for an ''Anschluss'' to the German Reich by using slogans such as ''[[Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer]]'' ("One People, One Empire, One Leader").{{sfn|Zeman|1973|pp=137-142}}

[[File:Dissolution of Austria-Hungary.png|thumb|right|upright=1.75|The dissolution of [[Austria–Hungary]] in 1918]]

===Austria during the First Austrian Republic 1918–1934===

By the end of World War I, Austria had been excluded from internal German affairs for more than fifty years since the [[Peace of Prague (1866)|Peace of Prague]] that concluded the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866.

Elite and popular opinion in Austria after 1918 largely favored some sort of union with Germany, but it was explicitly forbidden by the peace treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=S. W. |last=Gould |title=Austrian Attitudes toward Anschluss: October 1918 – September 1919 |journal=[[Journal of Modern History]] |year=1950 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=220–231 |jstor=1871752 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Austro-Hungarian Empire broke up in 1918, and on 12 November that year [[German Austria]] was declared a republic. The provisional national assembly drafted a provisional constitution that stated that "German Austria is a democratic republic" (Article 1) and "German Austria is a component of the German Republic" (Article 2). Later plebiscites in the German border provinces of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and [[Salzburg]] yielded majorities of 98% and 99% in favor of a unification with the German (i.e. Weimar) Republic.

In the aftermath of a prohibition of an ''Anschluss'', the Germans in both Austria and Germany pointed out to a contradiction in the national self-determination principle because it failed to grant it to the ethnic Germans (such as German Austrians and Sudeten Germans) outside of the German Reich.{{sfn|Stackelberg|1999|p=194}}&lt;ref&gt;Low (1976), p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] (both signed in 1919) explicitly prohibited the political inclusion of Austria in the German state. This measure was criticized by [[Hugo Preuss]], the drafter of the German [[Weimar Constitution]], who saw the prohibition as a contradiction of the [[Wilsonian]] principle of [[self-determination]] of peoples, intended to help bring peace to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (September 14, 1919) [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/09/14/archives/preuss-denounces-demand-of-allies-german-constitutions-author-says.html?sq=%22german+democratic+republic%22&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p Preuss Denounces Demand of Allies], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Following the destruction of [[World War I]], however, France and Britain feared the power of a larger Germany and had begun to disempower the current one. Austrian particularism{{clarify|date=December 2015}}, especially among the nobility, also played a role in the decisions; Austria was Roman Catholic, while Germany was dominated by Protestants, especially in government (the Prussian nobility, for example, was [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)#Royal Attempts to Merge Lutherans and Calvinists in Prussia|Lutheran]]). The constitutions of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[First Austrian Republic]] included the political goal of unification, which was widely supported by democratic parties. In the early 1930s, popular support in Austria for union with Germany remained overwhelming, and the Austrian government looked to a possible [[customs union]] with the German Republic in 1931.

===Nazi Germany and Austria ===

When the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]], led by [[Adolf Hitler]], rose to power in the Weimar Republic, the Austrian government withdrew from economic ties.&lt;!--This time sequence is vague. Did Austria withdraw as the Nazi movement grew, or after Hitler came to power?--&gt; Austria shared the economic turbulence of the [[Great Depression]], with a high unemployment rate, and unstable commerce and industry. During the 1920s it was a target for German investment capital. By 1937, rapid [[German re-armament|German rearmament]] increased Berlin's interest in annexing Austria, rich in raw materials and labour. It supplied Germany with [[magnesium]] and the products of the iron, textile and machine industries. It had gold and foreign currency reserves, many unemployed skilled workers, hundreds of idle factories, and large potential hydroelectric resources.&lt;ref&gt;David Walker, "Industrial Location in Turbulent Times: Austria through Anschluss and Occupation," ''Journal of Historical Geography'' (1986) 12#2 pp 182–195&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler, an Austrian German by birth,&lt;ref name="TaylorTaylor2001"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alan John Percivale|last=Taylor|title=The Course of German History: A Survey of the Development of German History Since 1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRZpQewEqQ0C&amp;pg=PA257|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-25405-2|pages=257–}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Hitler was an [[Ethnic Germans|ethnic German]], but was not a [[German nationality law|German citizen]] by birth since he had been born in the Austro-Hungarian empire.

Whilst infiltrating the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP), Hitler became involved in a heated political argument with a visitor, a Professor Baumann, who proposed that [[Bavaria]] should break away from [[Prussia]] and found a new South German nation with Austria. In vehemently attacking the man's arguments he made an impression on the other party members with his oratory skills and, according to Hitler, the "professor" left the hall acknowledging unequivocal defeat.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|page=75}} Impressed with Hitler, [[Anton Drexler]] invited him to join the DAP. Hitler accepted on September 12, 1919,&lt;ref&gt;Stackelberg, Roderick (2007) ''The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the party's 55th member.&lt;ref&gt;Mitcham, Samuel (1996) ''Why Hitler?: The Genesis of the Nazi Reich'' p.67&lt;/ref&gt; After becoming leader of the DAP, Hitler addressed a crowd on February 24, 1920, and in an effort to appeal to wider parts of the German population, the DAP was renamed the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|page=87}}

The 1920 [[National Socialist Program]] stated as its first point, "We demand the unification of all Germans in the Greater Germany on the basis of the people's right to self-determination." Hitler argued in a 1921 essay that the [[German Empire|German Reich]] had had a single task of, "incorporating the ten million German-Austrians in the Empire and dethroning the Hapsburgs, the most miserable dynasty ever ruling."&lt;ref&gt;Hamann, Brigitte (2010) ''Hitler's Vienna: A Portrait of the Tyrant as a Young Man''. Tauris Parke Paperbacks. p.107 {{isbn|9781848852778}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nazism|Nazis]] aimed to [[Heim ins Reich|re-unite all Germans]] either born or living outside of the ''Reich'' to create an "all-German ''Reich''". Hitler wrote in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1925) that he would create a union between his birth country Austria and Germany by any means possible.&lt;ref name="Hitler2010"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Adolf Hitler|author=Hitler, Adolf|title=Mein Kampf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBUBUEeUwxUC|date=June 2010|publisher=Bottom of the Hill|isbn=978-1-935785-07-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary inline|date=August 2018}}

The [[First Austrian Republic]], dominated from the late 1920s by the anti-''Anschluss''&lt;ref&gt;Staff (January 17, 1919) [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/01/17/98277146.pdf "Divide on German Austria; Centrists Favor Union, but Strong Influences Oppose It"], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic nationalist [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] (CS), gradually disintegrated from 1933 (dissolution of parliament and ban on the Austrian National Socialists) to 1934 ([[Austrian Civil War]] in February and ban on all remaining parties except the CS). The government evolved into a [[corporatist]], one-party government that combined the CS and the paramilitary ''[[Heimwehr]]''. It controlled labor relations and the press. (''See [[Austrofascism]] and [[Patriotic Front (Austria)|Patriotic Front]]'').

Power was centralized in the office of the [[Chancellor of Austria|chancellor]], who was empowered to [[rule by decree]]. The dominance of the Christian Social Party (whose economic policies were based on the papal encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'') was an Austrian phenomenon. Austria's national identity had strong Catholic elements that were incorporated into the movement, by way of clerical authoritarian tendencies not found in Nazism.&lt;!--This is unclear.--&gt; [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and his successor, [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], turned to [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italy for inspiration and support. The statist corporatism often referred to as Austrofascism bore more resemblance to [[Italian Fascism]] than to German National Socialism, and can be described as a form of [[clerical fascism]].

Mussolini supported the independence of Austria, largely due to his concern that Hitler would eventually press for the return of Italian territories once ruled by Austria. However, Mussolini needed German support in Ethiopia (''see [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]''). After receiving a [[South Tyrol Option Agreement|personal assurance from Hitler]] that Germany would not seek territorial concessions from Italy, Mussolini began a client relationship with Berlin that began with the 1937 [[Axis Powers|Berlin–Rome Axis]].

=== Austrian Civil War to ''Anschluss'' ===
{{Main article|Austrian Civil War|July Putsch|Austrofascism}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00805, Wien, Februarkämpfe, Bundesheer 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Soldiers of the [[Austrian Federal Army]] in Vienna, 12 February 1934.]]

The [[Austrian Nazi Party]] failed to win any seats in the [[Austrian legislative election, 1930|November 1930 general election]], but its popularity grew in Austria after Austrian-born Hitler came to power in Germany. The idea of the country joining Germany also grew in popularity, and ''Anschluss'' might have occurred by democratic process had Austrian Nazis not begun a terrorism campaign. [[John Gunther]] wrote in 1936, "In 1932 Austria was probably eighty percent pro-''Anschluss''".{{r|gunther1936}}

When Germany permitted residents of Austria to vote{{clarify|date=June 2016}}&lt;!-- Austrian citizens living in Germany in German elections? Austrian citizens in Austria in German elections? --&gt; on March 5, 1933, three special trains, boats and trucks brought such masses to [[Passau]] that the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] staged a ceremonial welcome.&lt;ref&gt;Rosmus, Anna (2015) ''Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau'' pp.53f&lt;/ref&gt; Gunther wrote that by the end of 1933 Austrian public opinion about German annexation was at least 60% against.&lt;ref name="gunther1936"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16059565W/Inside_Europe | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | author=Gunther, John | year=1936 | pages=284–285, 317–318}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 July 1934, Dollfuss was assassinated by Austrian Nazis in a failed coup. Afterwards, leading Austrian Nazis fled to Germany but they continued to push for unification from there. The remaining Austrian Nazis continued terrorist attacks against Austrian governmental institutions, causing a death toll of more than 800 between 1934 and 1938.

Dollfuss' successor was [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], who followed a political course similar to his predecessor. In 1935 Schuschnigg used the police to suppress Nazi supporters. Police actions under Schuschnigg included gathering Nazis (and Social Democrats) and holding them in [[internment camp]]s. The [[Austrofascism]] of Austria between 1934–1938 focused on the history of Austria and opposed the absorption of Austria into Nazi Germany (according to the philosophy Austrians were "better Germans"). Schuschnigg called Austria the "better German state" but struggled to keep Austria independent.

In an attempt to put Schuschnigg's mind at rest, Hitler delivered a speech at the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] and said: "Germany neither intends nor wishes to interfere in the internal affairs of Austria, to annex Austria or to conclude an Anschluss."{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=296}}

By 1936 the damage to Austria from the German boycott was too great. That summer Schuschnigg told Mussolini that his country had to come to an agreement with Germany. On 11 July 1936 he signed an agreement with German ambassador [[Franz von Papen]], in which Schuschnigg agreed to the release of Nazis imprisoned in Austria and Germany promised to respect Austrian sovereignty.{{r|gunther1936}} Under the terms of the Austro-German treaty, Austria declared itself a "German state" that would always follow Germany's lead in foreign policy, and members of the "National Opposition" were allowed to enter the cabinet, in exchange for which the Austrian Nazis promised to cease their terrorist attacks against the government. This did not satisfy Hitler and the pro-German Austrian Nazis grew in strength.

In September 1936, Hitler launched the [[Four Year Plan|Four-Year Plan]] that called for a dramatic increase in military spending and to make Germany as [[Autarky|autarkic]] as possible with the aim of having the ''Reich'' ready to fight a world war by 1940.&lt;ref name=overy&gt;[[Richard Overy|Overy, Richard]] (1999) "Germany and the Munich Crisis: A Mutilated Victory?" in Lukes, Igor and Goldstein, Rick (eds.) ''The Munich Crisis, 1938''  London: Frank Cass. p.200&lt;/ref&gt; The Four Year Plan required huge investments in the ''[[Reichswerke Hermann Göring|Reichswerke]]'' steel works, a programme for developing [[synthetic oil]] that soon went wildly over budget, and programmes for producing more chemicals and aluminium; the plan called for a policy of substituting imports and rationalizing industry to achieve its goals that failed completely.&lt;ref name=overy /&gt; As the Four Year Plan fell further and further behind its targets, [[Hermann Göring]], the chief of the Four Year Plan office, began to press for an ''Anschluss'' as a way of securing Austria's iron and other raw materials as a solution to the problems with the Four Year Plan.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=67}} The British historian Sir [[Ian Kershaw]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;...above all, it was Hermann Göring, at this time close to the pinnacle of his power, who far more than Hitler, throughout 1937 made the running and pushed the hardest for an early and radical solution to the 'Austrian Question'. Göring was not simply operating as Hitler's agent in matters relating to the 'Austrian Question'. His approach differed in emphasis in significant respects...But Göring's broad notions of foreign  policy, which he pushed to a great extent on his own initiative in the mid-1930s drew more on traditional pan-German concepts of nationalist power-politics to attain hegemony in Europe than on the racial dogmatism central to Hitler's ideology.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=67}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Göring was far more interested in the return of the former [[German colonial empire|German colonies]] in Africa than was Hitler, believed up to 1939 in the possibility of an Anglo-German alliance (an idea that Hitler had abandoned by late 1937), and wanted all Eastern Europe in the German economic [[sphere of influence]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|pp=67-68}} Göring did not share Hitler's interest in ''[[Lebensraum]]'' ("living space") as for him, merely having Eastern Europe in the German economic sphere of influence was sufficient.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=67}} In this context, having Austria annexed to Germany was the key towards bringing Eastern Europe into Göring's desired ''Grossraumwirtschaft'' ("greater economic space").{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|pp=67-68}}

Faced with problems in the Four Year Plan, Göring had become the loudest voice in Germany, calling for an ''Anschluss'', even at the risk of losing an alliance with Italy.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p= 68}} In April 1937, in a secret speech before a group of German industrialists, Göring stated that the only solution to the problems with meeting the steel production targets laid out by the Four Year Plan was to annex Austria, which Göring noted was rich in iron.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p= 68}} Göring did not give a date for the ''Anschluss'', but given that Four Year Plan's targets all had to be met by September 1940, and the current problems with meeting the steel production targets, suggested that he wanted an ''Anschluss'' in the very near-future.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p= 68}}

==End of an independent Austria==
Hitler told Goebbels in the late summer of 1937 that eventually Austria would have to be taken "by force".{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=45}} On 5 November 1937, Hitler called a meeting with the Foreign Minister [[Konstantin von Neurath]], the War Minister Field Marshal [[Werner von Blomberg]], the Army commander General [[Werner von Fritsch]], the [[Kriegsmarine]] commander  Admiral [[Erich Raeder]] and the [[Luftwaffe]] commander Herman Göring recorded in the [[Hossbach Memorandum]]. At the conference, Hitler stated that economic problems were causing Germany to fall behind in the arms race with Britain and France, and that the only solution was to launch in the near-future a series of wars to seize Austria and [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]], whose economies would be plundered to give Germany the lead in the arms race.&lt;ref&gt;Messerschmidt, Manfred “Foreign Policy and Preparation for War” from Germany and the Second World War pages 636–637&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carr, William Arms, Autarchy and Aggression pages 73–78.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1938, Hitler was seriously considering replacing Papen as ambassador to Austria with either Colonel [[Hermann Kriebel]], the German consul in [[Shanghai]] or [[Albert Forster]], the ''[[Gauleiter]]'' of Danzig.{{sfn|Weinberg|1981|p=46}} Significantly, neither Kriebel nor Forster were professional diplomats with Kriebel being one of the leaders of 1923 Munich Beerhall ''putsch'' who had been appointed consul in Shanghai to facilitate his work as an arms dealer in China while Forster was a ''Gauleiter'' who had proven he could get along with the Poles in his position in the [[Free City of Danzig]]; both men were Nazis who had shown some diplomatic skill.{{sfn|Weinberg|1981|p=46}} On 25 January 1938, the Austrian police raided the Vienna headquarters of the Austrian Nazi Party, arresting ''Gauleiter'' Leopold Tavs, the deputy to Captain Josef Leopold, discovered a cache of arms and plans for a ''putsch''.{{sfn|Weinberg|1981|p=46}}

Following increasing violence and demands from Hitler that Austria agree to a union, Schuschnigg met Hitler at [[Berchtesgaden]] on February 12, 1938,  in an attempt to avoid the takeover of Austria. Hitler presented Schuschnigg with a set of demands that included appointing Nazi sympathizers to positions of power in the government. The key appointment was that of [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] as Minister of Public Security, with full, unlimited control of the police. In return Hitler would publicly reaffirm the treaty of 11 July 1936 and reaffirm his support for Austria's national sovereignty. Browbeaten and threatened by Hitler, Schuschnigg agreed to these demands and put them into effect.&lt;ref&gt;Faber, (2010), pp.108–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Seyss-Inquart was a long-time supporter of the Nazis who sought the union of all Germans in one state. Leopold argues he was a moderate who favoured an evolutionary approach to union. He opposed the violent tactics of the Austrian Nazis, cooperated with Catholic groups, and wanted to preserve a measure of Austrian identity within Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Leopold, "Seyss-Inquart and the Austrian Anschluss," ''Historian'' (1986) 30#2 pp 199–218.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 February, Hitler made a speech before the Reichstag which was broadcast live and which for the first time was relayed also by the [[ORF (broadcaster)|Austrian radio network]]. A key phrase in the speech which was aimed at the Germans living in Austria and Czechoslovakia was: "… The German Reich is no longer willing to tolerate the suppression of ten million Germans across its borders."&lt;ref&gt;Giles MacDonogh, 1938: Hitler's Gamble, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schuschnigg announces a referendum===

On 9 March 1938, In the face of rioting by the small, but virulent, Austrian Nazi Party and ever-expanding German demands on Austria, Chancellor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] called a [[referendum]] ([[plebiscite]]) on the issue, to be held on 13 March. Infuriated, on 11 March, Adolf Hitler threatened invasion of Austria, and demanded Chancellor von Schuschnigg's resignation and the appointment of the Nazi [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] as his replacement. Hitler's plan was for Seyss-Inquart to call immediately for German troops to rush to Austria's aid, restoring order and giving the invasion an air of legitimacy. In the face of this threat, Schuschnigg informed Seyss-Inquart that the plebiscite would be cancelled.

On 9 March 1938, in an effort to preserve Austria's independence, Schuschnigg scheduled a [[plebiscite]] on the issue of unification for 13 March. To secure a large majority in the referendum, Schuschnigg dismantled the one-party state. He agreed to legalize the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democrats]] and their trade unions in return for their support in the referendum.{{sfn|Shirer|1984}} He also set the minimum voting age at 24 to exclude younger voters because the Nazi movement was most popular among the young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=G. Ward|title=Year of Reckoning|date=1939|publisher=Cassell|location=London|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Hitler had lowered the voting age for German elections held under Nazi rule, largely to compensate for the removal of [[German Jews|Jews]] and other ethnic minorities from the German electorate following enactment of the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935.{{citation needed|reason=No source|date=December 2017}}

The plan went awry when it became apparent that Hitler would not stand by while Austria declared its independence by public vote. Hitler declared that the referendum would be subject to major fraud and that Germany would never accept it. In addition, the German ministry of propaganda issued press reports that riots had broken out in Austria and that large parts of the Austrian population were calling for German troops to restore order. Schuschnigg immediately responded that reports of riots were false.&lt;ref&gt;Faber (2010), pp.121–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler sent an ultimatum to Schuschnigg on 11 March, demanding that he hand over all power to the Austrian Nazis or face an invasion. The ultimatum was set to expire at noon, but was extended by two hours. Without waiting for an answer, Hitler had already signed the order to send troops into Austria at one o'clock.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hitler Triumphant: Early Diplomatic Triumphs| url=http://hitlertriumphant.wordpress.com/early-diplomatic-triumphs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Nevertheless, the German Führer underestimated his opposition.

As Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist [[Edgar Ansel Mowrer]], reporting from Paris for [[CBS]], observed: "There is no one in all France who does not believe that Hitler invaded Austria not to hold a genuine plebiscite, but to prevent the plebiscite planned by Schusschnigg from demonstrating to the entire world just how little hold National Socialism really had on that tiny country."&lt;ref name="otr.com"&gt;CBS World Roundup Broadcast 13 March 1938 Columbia Broadcasting System retrieved from http://otr.com/ra/news/CBS_Roundup_3-13-1938.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly it was Hitler, and not Schuschnigg, who was terrified by the potential results of the scheduled plebiscite, and that was the best indication of where Austrians' loyalty lay.

Schuschnigg desperately sought support for Austrian independence in the hours following the ultimatum. Realizing that neither France nor Britain was willing to offer assistance, Schuschnigg resigned on the evening of 11 March, but President [[Wilhelm Miklas]] refused to appoint Seyss-Inquart as Chancellor. At 8:45 pm, Hitler, tired of waiting, ordered the invasion to commence at dawn on 12 March regardless.&lt;ref&gt;Nazis Take Austria, The History Place, retrieved from http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/triumph/tr-austria.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Around 10 pm, a forged telegram was sent in Seyss-Inquart's name asking for German troops, since he was not yet Chancellor and was unable to do so himself. Seyss-Inquart was not installed as Chancellor until after midnight, when Miklas resigned himself to the inevitable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{sfn|Shirer|1984}} In the radio broadcast in which he announced his resignation, he argued that he accepted the changes and allowed the Nazis to take over the government 'to avoid the shedding of fraternal blood [''Bruderblut'']'.&lt;ref&gt;See 'Vienna, 1938', in Hans Keller, ''1975: 1984 minus 9'', Dennis Dobson, 1977, p. 28 {{cite web|last=Mayerhofer|year=1998|url=http://www.wienerzeitung.at/linkmap/personen/miklaspopup.htm|title=Österreichs Weg zum Anschluss im März 1938|publisher=Wiener Zeitung Online|language=German|accessdate=11 March 2007}} Detailed article on the events of the ''Anschluss'', in German.&lt;/ref&gt; Seyss-Inquart was appointed chancellor after midnight on 12 March.

It is said that after listening to [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Bruckner's Seventh Symphony]], Hitler cried: "How can anyone say that Austria is not German! Is there anything more German than our old pure Austrianness?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holocaustmusic.ort.org/politics-and-propaganda/third-reich/bruckner-anton/|title=Music and the Holocaust|first=World|last=ORT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German troops march into Austria ===
{{Main article|Austria under National Socialism}}

On the morning of 12 March, the [[8th Army (Wehrmacht)|8th Army]] of the German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' crossed the border into Austria. The troops were greeted by cheering Austrians with Nazi salutes, Nazi flags, and flowers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Speer]] recalled the Austrians cheering approval as cars of Germans entered what had once been an independent Austria. Speer (1997), p.109&lt;/ref&gt; For the ''Wehrmacht'', the invasion was the first big test of its machinery. Although the invading forces were badly organized and coordination among the units was poor, it mattered little because the Austrian government had ordered the Austrian [[Austrian Armed Forces|Bundesheer]] not to resist.&lt;ref&gt;W. Carr, ''Arms, Autarky and Aggression: A study in German Foreign Policy, 1933–1939'', (Southampton, 1981) p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;

That afternoon, Hitler, riding in a car, crossed the border at his birthplace, [[Braunau am Inn]], with a 4,000 man bodyguard.&lt;ref name="otr.com"/&gt; In the evening, he arrived at [[Linz]] and was given an enthusiastic welcome. The enthusiasm displayed toward Hitler and the Germans surprised both Nazis and non-Nazis, as most people had believed that a majority of Austrians opposed ''Anschluss''.{{r|macdonogh2009}}&lt;ref&gt;Surprised or not, Hitler’s schoolboy dream of a "greater Germany" had come to fruition when Austria was incorporated into the Reich. Ozment (2005), p.274.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Germans from both Austria and Germany welcomed the ''Anschluss'' as they saw it as completing the complex and long overdue German unification of all Germans united into one-state.{{sfn|Stackelberg|1999|p=170}} Hitler had originally intended to leave Austria as a [[puppet state]] with Seyss-Inquart as head of a pro-Nazi government. However, the overwhelming reception caused him to change course and absorb Austria into the Reich. On 13 March Seyss-Inquart announced the revocation of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)#Politics and military|Article 88 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain]], which prohibited the unification of Austria and Germany, and approved the replacement of the [[States of Austria|Austrian states]] with ''[[Reichsgau]]e''.{{r|macdonogh2009}} The seizure of Austria demonstrated once again Hitler's aggressive territorial ambitions, and, once again, the failure of the British and the French to take action against him for violating the Versailles Treaty. Their lack of will emboldened him toward further aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand (1973), pp.60-61&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler's journey through Austria became a triumphal tour that climaxed in [[Vienna]] on 15 March 1938, when around 200,000 cheering German Austrians gathered around the ''[[Heldenplatz]]'' (Square of Heroes) to hear Hitler say that "The oldest eastern province of the German people shall be, from this point on, the newest bastion of the German Reich"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFb2-sYf6XIC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq='The+oldest+eastern+...+German+people+shall+be,+from+this+point+on,+the+newest+bastion+of+the+German+Reich&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R9LTlQ1RB5&amp;sig=EOgL2PuKHXK8khgC29RehIJYmz0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8yIeUNOiL4Gt0QWPrYHoDg&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q='The%20oldest%20eastern%20...%20German%20people%20shall%20be%2C%20from%20this%20point%20on%2C%20the%20newest%20bastion%20of%20the%20German%20Reich&amp;f=false|page=184|title=The German Myth of the East: 1800 to the Present|first=Vejas Gabriel|last=Liulevicius|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by his "greatest accomplishment" (completing the annexing of Austria to form a Greater German Reich) by saying "As leader and chancellor of the German nation and Reich I announce to German history now the entry of my homeland into the German Reich."&lt;ref&gt;Original German: ''"Als Führer und Kanzler der deutschen Nation und des Reiches melde ich vor der deutschen Geschichte nunmehr den Eintritt meiner Heimat in das Deutsche Reich."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aeiou.iicm.tugraz.at/aeiou.film.data.film/f107a.mpg|title=Video: Hitler proclaims Austria's inclusion in the Reich (2 MB)|accessdate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler later commented: "Certain foreign newspapers have said that we fell on Austria with brutal methods. I can only say: even in death they cannot stop lying. I have in the course of my political struggle won much love from my people, but when I crossed the former frontier (into Austria) there met me such a stream of love as I have never experienced. Not as tyrants have we come, but as liberators."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWanschluss.htm|title=Anschluss|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050621074010/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWanschluss.htm|archivedate=21 June 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler said as a personal note to the ''Anschluss'': "I, myself, as Führer and Chancellor, will be happy to walk on the soil of the country that is my home as a free German citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Giblin, James|title=The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler|year=2002|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-395-90371-8|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Toland, John|authorlink=John Toland|title=Adolf Hitler: The Definitive Biography|date=2014|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-87277-2|page=450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler's popularity reached an unprecedented peak after he fulfilled the ''Anschluss'' because he had completed the long-awaited idea of a Greater Germany. [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] had not chosen to include Austria in his 1871 [[Unification of Germany|reunification of Germany]], and there was genuine support from Germans in both Austria and Germany for an ''Anschluss''.{{sfn|Stackelberg|1999|p=170}}

Hitler's forces suppressed all opposition. Before the first German soldier crossed the border, [[Heinrich Himmler]] and a few [[SS]] officers landed in Vienna to arrest prominent representatives of the First Republic, such as [[Richard Schmitz]], [[Leopold Figl]], [[Friedrich Hillegeist]], and [[Franz Olah]]. During the few weeks between the ''Anschluss'' and the plebiscite, authorities rounded up Social Democrats, Communists, other potential political dissenters, and [[History of the Jews in Austria|Austrian Jews]], and imprisoned them or sent them to [[concentration camp]]s. Within a few days of 12 March, 70,000 people had been arrested. The disused northwest railway station in Vienna was converted into a makeshift concentration camp.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (March 28, 1938) "Austria: 'Spring Cleaning'" ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The plebiscite was subject to large-scale propaganda and to the abrogation of the voting rights of around 400,000 people (nearly 10% of the eligible voting population), mainly former members of left-wing parties and Jews.&lt;ref name="Austrian Resistance"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2014}}

The newly installed Nazis, within two days, transferred power to Germany, and ''Wehrmacht'' troops entered Austria to enforce the ''Anschluss''. The Nazis held a controlled plebiscite (''Volksabstimmung'') in the whole Reich within the following month, asking the people to ratify the ''fait accompli'', and claimed that 99.7561% of the votes cast in Austria were in favor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/attoc.html#at0047 Austria: A Country Study.] Select link on left for The Anschluss and World War II.

Although the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] were committed to upholding the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and those of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|St. Germain]], which specifically prohibited the union of Austria and Germany, their reaction was only verbal and moderate. No military confrontation took place, and even the strongest voices against the annexation, particularly [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)#Fascism|Fascist Italy]], [[Third French Republic|France]], and Britain (the "[[Stresa Front]]") remained at peace. The loudest verbal protest was voiced by the government of [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/the-ministry/press/announcements/2008/joint-communique-by-austria-and-mexico-on-the-occasion-of-the-70th-anniversary-of-the-mexican-protest-against-the-anschluss-of-austria-by-nazi-germany/|title=Joint communiqué by Austria and Mexico on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Mexican protest against the "Anschluss" of Austria by Nazi Germany – BMEIA, Außenministerium Österreich|first=Außenministerium der Republik|last=Österreich|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actions against the Jews==
The campaign against the Jews began immediately after the ''Anschluss''. They were driven through the streets of Vienna, their homes and shops were plundered.

All synagogues and prayer houses in Vienna were destroyed. The [[Stadttempel]] was the sole survivor due to its location in a residential district which prevented it from being burned down. Most Jewish shops were plundered and closed. Over 6,000 Jews were arrested overnight, the majority deported to [[Dachau concentration camp]] in the following days.&lt;ref name="McKale2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=McKale|first=Donald|title=Hitler's Shadow War: The Holocaust and World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aX4IuvfX194C&amp;pg=PA109|year=2006|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|isbn=978-1-4616-3547-5|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nuremberg Laws]] applied in Austria from May 1938, later reinforced with innumerable anti-Semitic decrees.

The Nazis dissolved Jewish organisations and institutions, hoping to force Jews to emigrate. Their plans succeeded—by the end of 1941, 130,000 Jews had left Vienna, 30,000 of whom went to the United States. They left behind all of their property, but were forced to pay the [[Reich Flight Tax]], a tax on all émigrés from Nazi Germany; some received financial support from international aid organisations so that they could pay this tax. The majority of the Jews who had stayed in Vienna eventually became victims of the [[Holocaust]]. Of the more than 65,000 Viennese Jews who were deported to concentration camps, little more than 2,000 survived.{{sfn|Pauley|2000|pages=297-98}}

==Plebiscite==
{{Main article|Austrian Anschluss referendum, 1938}}
The ''Anschluss'' was given immediate effect by legislative act on 13 March, subject to ratification by a [[plebiscite]]. Austria became the province of [[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]], and Seyss-Inquart was appointed governor. [[Austrian Anschluss referendum, 1938|The plebiscite]] was held on 10 April and officially recorded a support of 99.7% of the voters.&lt;ref name="Austrian Resistance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doew.at/thema/thema_alt/wuv/maerz38_2/propaganda.html |title=Die propagandistische Vorbereitung der Volksabstimmung |publisher=Austrian Resistance Archive |year=1988 |accessdate=11 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404180146/http://www.doew.at/thema/thema_alt/wuv/maerz38_2/propaganda.html |archivedate=4 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While historians concur that the votes were accurately counted, the process was neither free nor secret. Officials were present directly beside the voting booths and received the voting ballot by hand (in contrast to a [[Secret ballot|secret vote]] where the voting ballot is inserted into a closed box). In some remote areas of Austria, people voted to preserve the independence of Austria on 13 March (in Schuschnigg's planned but cancelled plebiscite) despite the ''Wehrmacht''{{'}}s presence. For instance, in the village of [[Innervillgraten]], a majority of 95% voted for Austria's independence.&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_461500064/1938_Austria.html |title=1938: Austria |publisher=MSN Encarta |accessdate=11 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKPWQLi?url=http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_461500064/1938_Austria.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the plebiscite on 10 April, 73.3% of votes in Innervillgraten were in favor of the ''Anschluss'', which was still the lowest number of all Austrian municipalities.&lt;ref name="Tirol multimedial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tirolmultimedial.at/tmm/themen/0705v.html|title=Anschluss Tirols an NS-Deutschland und Judenpogrom in Innsbruck 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no doubt that the plebiscite result was manipulated and rigged, there was unquestionably a lot of genuine support for Hitler for carrying out the ''Anschluss''.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=83}}

Austria remained part of Germany until the end of World War II. A provisional Austrian government declared the ''Anschluss'' "null und nichtig" ([[null and void]]) on 27 April 1945. Henceforth, Austria was recognized as a separate country, although it remained divided into [[Allied-occupied Austria|occupation zones]] and controlled by the [[Allied Commission#Austria|Allied Commission]] until 1955, when the [[Austrian State Treaty]] restored its sovereignty.

==Banking and assets==
Germany, which had a shortage of steel and a weak [[balance of payments]], gained iron ore mines in the [[Erzberg]] and 748 million [[Reichsmark|RM]] in the reserves of Austria's central bank [[Oesterreichische Nationalbank]], more than twice its own cash.&lt;ref name="macdonogh2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=1938|publisher=Basic Books|author=MacDonogh, Giles|year=2009|pages=35–36|isbn=978-0-465-02012-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, some bank accounts were transferred from Austria to Germany as "enemy property accounts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Page 32 USACA - Property Control Branch| work = Fold3| accessdate = 2018-08-11| url = https://www.fold3.com/image/114/312239623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions to the ''Anschluss''==
Austria in the first days of Nazi Germany's control had many contradictions: at one and the same time, Hitler's regime began to tighten its grip in every aspect of society, beginning with mass arrests as thousands of Austrians tried to escape; yet other Austrians cheered and welcomed the German troops entering their territory.

In March 1938 the local Gauleiter of [[Gmunden]], [[Upper Austria]], gave a speech to the local Austrians and told them in plain terms that all "traitors" of Austria were to be thrown into the newly opened concentration camp at [[Mauthausen-Gusen]].{{sfn|Gellately|2002|p=69}} The camp became notorious for its cruelty and barbarism. During its existence an estimated 200,000 people died, half of whom were killed.{{sfn|Gellately|2002|p=69}}

The [[Anti-Romanyism|antigypsyism]] sentiment was implemented initially most harshly in Austria when between 1938-1939 the Nazis arrested around 2,000 Gypsy men whom were sent to [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and 1,000 Gypsy women whom were sent to [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]].{{sfn|Gellately|2002|p=108}} Starting in 1939, Austrian Gypsies had to register themselves to local authorities.{{sfn|Gellately|2001|p=222}} The Nazis began to publish articles linking the Gypsies with criminality.{{sfn|Gellately|2001|p=222}} Until 1942, the Nazis had made a distinction between "pure Gypsies" and "Gypsy ''[[Mischlinge]]s''.{{sfn|Gellately|2001|p=225}} However, Nazi racial research claimed that 90% of Gypsies were of mixed ancestry. Subsequently, the Nazis ordered that the Gypsies were to be treated on the same level as the Jews.{{sfn|Gellately|2001|p=225}}

Many Austrian political figures announced their support of the ''Anschluss'' and their relief that it happened without violence. Cardinal [[Theodor Innitzer]] (a political figure of the CS) declared as early as 12 March: "The Viennese Catholics should thank the Lord for the bloodless way this great political change has occurred, and they should pray for a great future for Austria. Needless to say, everyone should obey the orders of the new institutions." The other Austrian bishops followed suit some days later. [[Vatican Radio]], however, broadcast a strong denunciation of the German action, and [[Pius XII|Cardinal Pacelli]], the [[Cardinal Secretary of State|Vatican Secretary of State]], ordered Innitzer to report to Rome. Before meeting the Pope, Innitzer met Pacelli, who had been outraged by Innitzer's statement. He told Innitzer to retract his statement; he was made to sign a new statement, issued on behalf of all the Austrian bishops, that stated: "The solemn declaration of the Austrian bishops... was clearly not intended to be an approval of something that was not and is not compatible with God's law".{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The Vatican newspaper reported that the German bishops' earlier statement had been issued without approval from Rome.

Robert Kauer, president of the minority [[Lutheran Church]] in Austria, greeted Hitler on 13 March as "saviour of the 350,000 German Protestants in Austria and liberator from a five-year hardship".{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} [[Karl Renner]], the most famous Social Democrat of the First Republic, announced his support for the ''Anschluss'' and appealed to all Austrians to vote in favour of it on 10 April.&lt;ref name="Encarta"/&gt;

The international response to the ''Anschluss'' was publicly moderate. ''[[The Times]]'' commented that 300 years before, Scotland had [[Acts of Union 1707|joined]] England as well, and that this event would not really differ much. On 14 March, the British Prime Minister, [[Neville Chamberlain]] spoke about the "Austrian situation" in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. He noted that the British ambassador in Berlin objected to the use of "coercion, backed by force" that would undermine Austria's independence.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Chamberlain, "[http://web.jjay.cuny.edu/~jobrien/reference/ob92.html Statement of the Prime Minister in the House of Commons, 14 March 1938] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20000525164230/http://web.jjay.cuny.edu/~jobrien/reference/ob92.html |date=25 May 2000 }}."&lt;/ref&gt; Within this speech Chamberlain also said, "The hard fact is that nothing could have arrested what has actually happened [in Austria] unless this country and other countries had been prepared to use force."{{sfn|Shirer|1984|p=308}}

The subdued reaction to the ''Anschluss'' (the U.S. issued a similar statement) led to Hitler's conclusion that he could use more aggressive tactics in his "roadmap" to expand Nazi Germany, as he would later do in annexing the [[Sudetenland]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}

On March 18, 1938, the German government communicated to the Secretary General of the [[League of Nations]] about the inclusion of Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Chronology of the League of Nations [http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/(httpAssets)/3DA94AAFEB9E8E76C1256F340047BB52/$file/sdn_chronology.pdf] Retrieved September 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; And next day in Geneva, the Mexican Delegate to the International Office of Labor, [[Isidro Fabela]], voiced an energetic protest, stronger than that expressed by European countries,&lt;ref&gt;Serrano Migallón, Francisco (2000) {{cite book|title=Con certera visión: Isidro Fabela y su tiempo|pages=112–113|isbn=968-16-6049-8|location=Mexico City|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica|year=2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QpQX_7BMmGEC}} In Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt; denouncing the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kloyber, Christian: "''Don Isidro Fabela: 50 años después de muerte.

==Legacy==
===''Anschluss'': annexation or union?===

The word ''Anschluss'' is properly translated as "joinder," "connection," "unification," or "political union." In contrast, the German word ''Annektierung'' (military [[annexation]]) was not, and is not commonly used now, to describe the union of Austria and Germany in 1938. The word ''Anschluss'' had been widespread before 1938 describing an incorporation of Austria into Germany. Calling the incorporation of Austria into Germany an "Anschluss," that is a "unification" or "joinder," was also part of the propaganda used in 1938 by Nazi Germany to create the impression that the union was not coerced. Hitler described the incorporation of Austria as a ''Heimkehr'', a return to its original home.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Jody Abigail (ndg) ''Austria at the Crossroads: The Anschluss and its Opponents'' (thesis) pp.269, 304. [[Cardiff UNiversity]]&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Anschluss'' has endured since 1938, despite being a euphemism for what took place.

Some sources, like the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', describe the ''Anschluss'' as an "annexation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article?tocId=9355453&amp;query=plebiscite&amp;ct=|title=Anschluss|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a union.

[[File:Nazi Germany.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|A map showing the border changes of Germany in the various years 1933 (red), 1939 (pink) and 1943 (orange).]]

===Changes in Central Europe===

The ''Anschluss'' was among the first major steps in Austrian-born Hitler's desire to create a [[German question#Later influence|Greater German Reich]] that was to include all [[ethnic Germans]] and all the [[Treaty of Versailles#Territorial changes|lands and territories]] that the [[German Empire]] had lost after the [[World War I|First World War]]. Although Austria was predominantly ethnically German and had been part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until it dissolved in 1806 and the [[German Confederation]]&lt;ref name="Heeren1873_p480-482"&gt;{{citation |title=A Manual of the History of the Political System of Europe and its Colonies |last1=Heeren |first1=Arnold Hermann Ludwig |editor-last=Talboys |editor-first=David Alphonso |editor-link=David Alphonso Talboys |year=1873 |pages=480–481 |publisher=H. G. Bohn |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vc88AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA480 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1866 after the defeat in the [[Austro-Prussian War]], it had never been a part of the German Empire. The [[unification of Germany]] brought about by [[Otto von Bismarck]] created that [[Prussia]]n-dominated entity in 1871, with Austria, Prussia's rival for dominance of the German states, explicitly excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Eyck (1958) ''Bismark and the German Empire'' New York: Norton. pp.174-187; 188-194&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to annexing Austria in 1938, Nazi Germany had [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized]] the [[Rhineland]], and the [[Saarland#History|Saar]] region was returned to Germany after 15 years of occupation through a plebiscite. After the ''Anschluss'', Hitler targeted Czechoslovakia, provoking an international crisis which led to the [[Munich Agreement]] in September 1938, giving Nazi Germany control of the industrial [[Sudetenland]], which had a predominantly ethnic German population. In March 1939, Hitler then dismantled Czechoslovakia by recognising the independence of [[Slovakia]] and making the rest of the nation a [[protectorate]]. That same year, [[Memelland]] was returned from Lithuania.

With the ''Anschluss'', the Republic of Austria ceased to exist as an independent state. At the end of World War II, a Provisional Austrian Government under [[Karl Renner]] was set up by conservatives, Social Democrats and Communists on 27 April 1945 (when Vienna had already been occupied by the [[Red Army]]). It cancelled the ''Anschluss'' the same day and was legally recognized by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in the following months. In 1955 the [[Austrian State Treaty]] re-established Austria as a sovereign state.

===Second Republic===

====Moscow Declaration====
The [[Moscow Declaration]] of 1943, signed by the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, included a "Declaration on Austria", which stated the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The governments of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States of America are agreed that Austria, the first free country to fall a victim to Hitlerite aggression, shall be liberated from German domination.

They regard the annexation imposed on Austria by Germany on 15 March 1938, as null and void. They consider themselves as in no way bound by any changes effected in Austria since that date. They declare that they wish to see re-established a free and independent Austria and thereby to open the way for the Austrian people themselves, as well as those neighbouring States which will be faced with similar problems, to find that political and economic security which is the only basis for lasting peace.

Austria is reminded, however, that she has a responsibility, which she cannot evade, for participation in the war at the side of Hitlerite Germany, and that in the final settlement account will inevitably be taken of her own contribution to her liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uibk.ac.at/zeitgeschichte/zis/library/keyserlingk.html|title=Moskauer Deklaration 1943 und die alliierte Nachkriegsplanung|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Jelavich]] – ''Modern Austria: Empire and Republic, 1815–1986'', Cambridge University Press 1987, p.238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The declaration was mostly intended to serve as propaganda aimed at stirring [[Austrian resistance]]. Although some Austrians aided [[History of the Jews in Austria|Jews]] and are counted as [[Righteous Among the Nations]], there never was an effective Austrian armed resistance of the sort found in other [[German-occupied Europe|countries under German occupation]].

However, other occupied countries, such as [[German occupation of Norway|Norway]], [[German-occupied Poland|Poland]] and [[German occupation of France|France]], had no such requirements to forcibly provide troops to the Wehrmacht, and their resistance movements had virtually the entire male populace of those countries, to call upon. Also, even the extremely few men, untouched by conscription in Austria, who might make up a resistance movement, would certainly know that they would probably be killing fellow Austrians, forced into German service, with each and every resistance movement attack.

The Moscow Declaration is said to have a somewhat complex drafting history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Stourzh]], [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/4859 "Waldheim's Austria"], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' 34, no. 3 (February 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; At Nuremberg, [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/judgment/j-defendants-seyss-inquart.html Judgment, The Defendants: Seyss-Inquart]," [[The Nizkor Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Franz von Papen]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/judgment/j-defendants-von-papen.html The Defendants: Von Papen]," The Nizkor Project.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular, were both indicted under count one (conspiracy to commit crimes against peace) specifically for their activities in support of the Austrian Nazi Party and the ''Anschluss'', but neither was convicted of this count. In acquitting von Papen, the court noted that his actions were in its view political immoralities but not crimes under its charter. Seyss-Inquart was convicted of other serious war crimes, most of which took place in Poland and the Netherlands, was sentenced to death and executed.

====Austrian identity and the "[[victim theory]]"====
{{Main article|Austria — the Nazis' first victim}}
[[File:Rot-Weiss-Rot-Buch 1946.jpg|thumb|"Red-White-Red Book" published by the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1946 describes the events of Austria between 1938-1945 by the Founders of the Second Austrian Republic.]]
After World War II many [[Austrians]] sought comfort in the idea of Austria as being the [[Austria — the Nazis' first victim|first victim of the Nazis]]. Although the Nazi party was promptly banned, Austria did not have the same thorough process of [[denazification]] that was imposed on Germany. Lacking outside pressure for political reform, factions of Austrian society tried for a long time to advance the view that the ''Anschluss'' was only an annexation at the point of a bayonet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beniston|first=Judith|year=2003|title= 'Hitler's First Victim'? — Memory and Representation in Post-War Austria: Introduction|journal=[[Austrian Studies (journal)|Austrian Studies]]|volume=11|pages=1–13|jstor=27944673|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of the events of 1938 has deep roots in the 10 years of Allied occupation and the struggle to regain Austrian sovereignty: the "[[victim theory]]" played an essential role in the negotiations for the [[Austrian State Treaty]] with the Soviets, and by pointing to the Moscow Declaration, Austrian politicians heavily relied on it to achieve a solution for Austria different from the division of Germany into separate Eastern and Western states. The state treaty, alongside the subsequent Austrian declaration of permanent [[Neutral country|neutrality]], marked important milestones for the solidification of Austria's independent national identity during the course of the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;Steininger (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

As Austrian politicians of the left and right attempted to reconcile their differences to avoid the violent conflict that had dominated the First Republic, discussions of both [[Austrian Nazism]] and Austria's role during the Nazi-era were largely avoided. Still, the [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP) had advanced, and still advances, the argument that the establishment of the Dollfuss dictatorship was necessary to maintain Austrian independence. On the other hand, the [[Austrian Social Democratic Party]] (SPÖ) argues that the Dollfuss dictatorship stripped the country of the democratic resources necessary to repel Hitler; yet it ignores the fact that Hitler himself was a native of Austria.{{sfn|Art|2006|p=101}}

It has also helped the Austrians develop their own [[national identity]] as before. After [[World War II]] and the fall of Nazi Germany the political ideology of [[Pan-Germanism]] fell into disfavor and is now seen by the majority of German-speaking people as taboo.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Unlike earlier in the 20th century when there was no Austrian identity separate from a German one, in 1987 only 6% of the Austrians identified themselves as "Germans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ernst Bruckmüller|title=Die Entwicklung des Österreichbewußtseins|url=http://iiss210.joanneum.at/demokratiezentrum2/media/pdf/bruckmueller.pdf|year=|language=German|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041605/http://iiss210.joanneum.at/demokratiezentrum2/media/pdf/bruckmueller.pdf|archivedate=28 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey carried out in 2008 concluded that over 90% of Austrians considered themselves to be an independent nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Österreicher fühlen sich heute als Nation|url=http://derstandard.at/3261105/Oesterreicher-fuehlen-sich-heute-als-Nation|year=2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political events====

For decades, the victim theory remained largely undisputed in Austria. The public was rarely forced to confront the legacy of Nazi Germany. One of those occasions arose in 1965, when [[Taras Borodajkewycz]], a professor of economic history, made anti-Semitic remarks following the death of [[Ernst Kirchweger]], a concentration camp survivor killed by a right-wing protester during riots. It was not until the 1980s that Austrians confronted their mixed past on a large scale. The catalyst for the ''[[Vergangenheitsbewältigung]]'' (struggle to come to terms with the past) was the Waldheim affair.   [[Kurt Waldheim]], a candidate in the presidential election and former [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]], was accused of having been a member of the Nazi party and of the infamous [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] (he was later absolved of direct involvement in [[war crimes]]). The Waldheim affair started the first serious discussions about Austria's past and the ''Anschluss''.

Another factor was the rise of [[Jörg Haider]] and the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FPÖ) in the 1980s. The party had combined elements of the [[pan-German]] right with [[free-market liberalism]] since its foundation in 1955, but after Haider ascended to the party chairmanship in 1986, the liberal elements became increasingly marginalized. Haider began to openly use nationalist and anti-immigrant rhetoric. He was criticised for using the ''völkisch'' (ethnic) definition of national interest ("Austria for Austrians") and his apologetics for Austria's past, notably calling members of the [[Waffen-SS]] "men of honour". Following a dramatic rise in electoral support in the 1990s that peaked in the [[Austria legislative election, 1999|1999 elections]], the FPÖ entered a coalition with the [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP), led by [[Wolfgang Schüssel]]. This was condemned in 2000. The coalition prompted the regular ''Donnerstagsdemonstrationen'' (Thursday demonstrations) in protest against the government, which took place on the [[Heldenplatz]] where Hitler had greeted the masses during the ''Anschluss''. Haider's tactics and rhetoric, often criticised as sympathetic to Nazism, forced Austrians to reconsider their relationship to the past. Haider's coalition partner, former Chancellor [[Wolfgang Schüssel]], in a 2000 interview with the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', reiterated the "first victim" theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salzburg.com/cgi-bin/sn/printArticle.pl?xm=165129 Short note on Schüssel's interview in the Jerusalem Post (in German)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Salzburger Nachrichten'', 11 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Literature====

The political discussions and soul-searching were reflected in other aspects of culture. [[Thomas Bernhard]]'s last play, ''Heldenplatz'' (1988), generated controversy even before it was produced, fifty years after Hitler's entrance to the city. Bernhard made the historic elimination of references to Hitler's reception in Vienna emblematic of Austrian attempts to claim its history and culture under questionable criteria. Many politicians called Bernhard a ''Nestbeschmutzer'' (damaging the reputation of his country) and openly demanded that the play should not be staged in Vienna's [[Burgtheater]]. Waldheim, still president, called the play "a crude insult to the Austrian people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/bernhard.htm |title=Thomas Bernhard |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217180958/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/bernhard.htm |archivedate=17 February 2005 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical Commission and outstanding legal issues===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 152-65-04, Wien, SS-Razzia bei jüdischer Gemeinde.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The SS raid a Jewish community center, Vienna, March 1938.]]

In the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] the ''[[Vergangenheitsbewältigung]]'' ("struggle to come to terms with the past") has been partially institutionalised in literary, cultural, political, and educational contexts. Austria formed a ''Historikerkommission''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historikerkommission.gv.at/ Austrian Historical Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421052556/http://www.historikerkommission.gv.at/ |date=21 April 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; ("Historian's Commission" or "Historical Commission") in 1998 with a mandate to review Austria's role in the Nazi expropriation of Jewish property from a scholarly rather than legal perspective, partly in response to continuing criticism of its handling of property claims. Its membership was based on recommendations from various quarters, including [[Simon Wiesenthal]] and [[Yad Vashem]]. The Commission delivered its report in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austria.org/press/318.html Press statement on the report of the Austrian Historical Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050211181711/http://austria.org/press/318.html |date=11 February 2005 }} Austrian Press and Information Service, 28 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Noted Holocaust historian [[Raul Hilberg]] refused to participate in the Commission and in an interview he stated his strenuous objections in terms both personal and in reference to larger questions about Austrian culpability and liability, comparing what he thought to be relative inattention by the [[World Jewish Congress]] to the settlement governing the Swiss bank holdings of those who died or were displaced by the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=3&amp;ar=167 Hilberg interview with the ''Berliner Zeitung,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715192434/http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=3&amp;ar=167 |date=15 July 2012 }} as quoted by [[Norman Finkelstein]]'s web site.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] continues to criticise Austria (as recently as June 2005) for its alleged historical and ongoing unwillingness aggressively to pursue investigations and trials against Nazis for war crimes and crimes against humanity from the 1970s onwards. Its 2001 report offered the following characterization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Given the extensive participation of numerous Austrians, including at the highest levels, in the implementation of the Final Solution and other Nazi crimes, Austria should have been a leader in the prosecution of Holocaust perpetrators over the course of the past four decades, as has been the case in Germany. Unfortunately relatively little has been achieved by the Austrian authorities in this regard and in fact, with the exception of the case of [[Heinrich Gross|Dr. Heinrich Gross]] which was suspended this year under highly suspicious circumstances (he claimed to be medically unfit, but outside the court proved to be healthy) not a single Nazi war crimes prosecution has been conducted in Austria since the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Efraim Zuroff, "[http://www.dickinson.edu/magazine/fall02/wiesenthal.html Worldwide Investigation and Prosecution of Nazi War Criminals, 2001–2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050211152303/http://www.dickinson.edu/magazine/fall02/wiesenthal.html |date=11 February 2005 }}," Simon Wiesenthal Center, Jerusalem (April 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2003, the Center launched a worldwide effort named "Operation: Last Chance" in order to collect further information about those Nazis still alive that are potentially subject to prosecution. Although reports issued shortly thereafter credited Austria for initiating large-scale investigations, there has been one case where criticism of Austrian authorities arose recently: The Center put 92-year-old Croatian [[Milivoj Asner]] on its 2005 top ten list. Asner fled to Austria in 2004 after Croatia announced it would start investigations in the case of war crimes he may have been involved in. In response to objections about Asner's continued freedom, Austria's federal government deferred to either extradition requests from Croatia or prosecutorial actions from [[Klagenfurt]], claiming reason of dementia in 2008. Milivoj Ašner died on 14 June 2011 at the age of 98 in his room in a Caritas nursing home still in Klagenfurt.

'''Assembly of Captive European Nations''' or '''ACEN''' was an organization founded on September 20, 1954, as a coalition of representatives from nine nations in Central and [[Eastern Europe]] under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] domination after [[World War II]]. Former political and cultural leaders from [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Estonia]], [[Hungary]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]] and [[Romania]] were members of the organization. Its main office was in New York, with branch offices in Bonn, London and Paris.

==History==
The goals of the ACEN were, in their own words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;to provide liberation from communist dictatorship by peaceful means, to educate public opinion on the actual situation behind the Iron Curtain, and to enlist the cooperation and assistance of governmental and non-governmental institutions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Funding was provided by the [[National Committee for a Free Europe|Free Europe Committee]]. When that organization suspended financial assistance to ACEN in January 1972 because of its own budget reductions, the offices of ACEN were closed and publication activities came to a halt. During its lifetime the organization published pamphlets and periodicals in English, as well as some of the members' own languages. It also sponsored symposia and exhibitions, in particular it promoted the commemoration of [[Captive Nations Week]]. It provided background information to members of the [[United States Congress]] regarding the political and economic situations in their homelands situated behind the [[Iron Curtain]].

The records of the ACEN and its member organizations are preserved in the [https://www.lib.umn.edu/ihrca Immigration History Research Center Archives], [[University of Minnesota Libraries]].

'''Hezbollah Bayt al-Mal''', AKA Hezbollah Bayt al-Mal Lil Muslimeen, is a [[Hezbollah]]-controlled organization that performs financial services for the organization. In [[Arabic]], the term is used as "House of Money."

Bayt al-Mal operates under the direct supervision of Hezbollah Secretary General [[Hasan Nasrallah]]. As Hezbollah's main financial body, Bayt al-Mal serves as a bank, creditor, and investment arm for Hezbollah. [[Husayn al-Shami]] is the head of Bayt al-Mal.

It has branch offices in:
Harat Hurayk, Beirut, [[Lebanon]];
Burj Al-Barajinah, Lebanon;
Sidon, Lebanon;
Tyre, Lebanon;
Al-Nabatiyah, Lebanon;
Ba'albak, Lebanon; and
Hirmil, Lebanon.

Hezbollah Bayt al-Mal utilizes the [[Yousser Company for Finance and Investment]] to secure loans and finance business deals for Hezbollah companies.

According to Mr. [[Stuart Levey]], [[U.S. Department of Treasury]]'s Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI),"Bayt al-Mal functions as Hezbollah's unofficial treasury, holding and investing its assets and serving as intermediaries between the terrorist group and mainstream banks."

The central headquarters of Bayt al-Mal was located in Hezbollah's stronghold in [[Beirut]]'s southern suburbs.

The '''Black Liberation Army''' ('''BLA''') was an [[Clandestine cell system|underground]] [[Black Power]] organization that operated in the [[United States]] from 1970 to 1981. Composed entirely of [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]] (BPP) who served as members of both groups, the organization's program was one of [[armed struggle|war]] against the United States Government, and its stated goal was to "[[Armed struggle|take up arms]] for the liberation and [[self-determination]] of [[African Americans|black people]] in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.start.umd.edu/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=3708 |title=Terrorist Organization Profile - START - National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism|website=Start.umd.edu|date=1984-03-25|accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BLA carried out a series of bombings, killings of police officers and drug dealers, robberies (which participants termed "[[Confiscation|expropriations]]"), and prison breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cleaver|first1=Kathleen|last2=Katsiaficas|first2=George|title=Liberation, Imagination and the Black Panther Party: A New Look at the Black Panthers and Their Legacy|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135298326|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_tNQAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The Black Liberation Army gained strength as [[Black Panther Party]] membership declined. By 1970, [[police]] and [[FBI]] sabotage (see [[COINTELPRO]]), [[Espionage|infiltration]], [[sectarianism]], the lengthy prison sentences, and death of key members (among them [[Fred Hampton]]) had significantly undermined the Black Panther Party. This convinced many former party members of the desirability of an underground existence, seeing that a new period of violent repression by the U.S federal and local government was at hand. BLA members operated under the belief that only through covert means, including but not limited to retribution, could the movement be continued until such a time when an above-ground existence was possible.

The conditions under which the Black Liberation Army formed are not entirely clear. It is commonly believed that the organization was founded by those who left the Black Panther Party after [[Eldridge Cleaver]] was expelled from the party's Central Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondediplo.com/2005/10/14blackpanthers|title=Caged panthers|website=Mondediplo.com|date=2005-10-11|accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fallout was inevitable between Cleaver and other Panther leaders after he publicly criticized the BPP, among other things accusing Panther social programs of being [[reformist]] rather than [[revolutionary]]. Others, including black revolutionary [[Geronimo Pratt]] (AKA Geronimo ji Jaga), assert that the BLA "as a movement concept pre-dated and was broader than the BPP," suggesting that it was a refuge for ex-Panthers rather than a new organization formed through schism.&lt;ref&gt;''Liberation, Imagination and the Black Panther Party'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Maxwell Stanford {{who|date=February 2017}} cites the Black Guards, a wing of the [[Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM)|Revolutionary Action Movement]], as direct BLA forerunners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulib.csuohio.edu/research/portals/blackpower/stanford.pdf|format=PDF|title=Revolutionary Action movement (RAM): A Case Study of an Urban Revolutionary Movement in Western Capitalist Society|website=Ulib.csuohio.edu|accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some accounts of the Black Liberation Army argue that the BLA grew out of the BPP and its original founders were members of the Party. The organization is often presented as a result of the repression on the BPP and the split within the Panthers. It is said to have formed after the collaboration of several Black revolutionary organizations and consisted of the Black underground which came to be collectively known as the Black Liberation Army. [[Assata Shakur]], in her autobiography, asserts:&lt;blockquote&gt;''“… the Black Liberation Army was not a centralized, organized group with a common leadership and chain of command. Instead there were various organizations and collectives working together and simultaneously  independent of each other.”&lt;ref&gt;Umoja, Akinyele Omowale (ed.) "Repression Breeds Resistance: The Black Liberation Army and the Radical Legacy of the Black Panther Party.",  ''New Political Science'', 21.2 (1999): 131-54.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The newly formed BLA believed that "the character of reformism is based on unprincipled class collaboration with our enemy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lib.msu.edu/AFS/dmc/radicalism/public/all/messageblackmovement/AAL.pdf?CFID=327481&amp;CFTOKEN=39064116|format=PDF|title=Message to the Black Movement|website=Archive.lib.msu.edu|accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and asserted the following principles:
# That we are [[anti-capitalist]], [[anti-imperialist]], [[anti-racist]], and anti-[[sexist]].
# That we must of necessity strive for the abolishment of these systems and for the institution of [[Socialist]]ic relationships in which Black people have total and absolute control over their own destiny as a people.
# That in order to abolish our systems of oppression, we must utilize the science of [[class struggle]], develop this science as it relates to our unique national condition.

==Activities==
According to a [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] report on BLA activity, the Black Liberation Army was suspected of involvement in over 70 incidents of violence between 1970 and 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assatashakur.org/forum//showpost.php?p%3D37245%26postcount%3D101 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 9, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044405/http://www.assatashakur.org/forum//showpost.php?p=37245&amp;postcount=101 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fraternal Order of Police]] blamed the BLA for the murders of 13 police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysfop.org/events/kathy_boudin.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 9, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060102131029/http://www.nysfop.org/events/kathy_boudin.htm |archivedate=January 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 1970, the BLA was believed to have planted a bomb in St. Brendan's Church in San Francisco while it was full of mourners attending the funeral of San Francisco police officer Harold Hamilton, who had been killed in the line of duty while responding to a [[bank robbery]]. The bomb was detonated, but no one in the church suffered serious injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Van Derbeken and Lagos. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/23/BAGRKNNFV04.DTL "Ex-militants charged in S.F. police officer's '71 slaying at station"], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'',January 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 1971, as many as five men participated in the murder of two New York City police officers, Joseph Piagentini and Waverly Jones. Those arrested and brought to trial for the shootings include [[Jalil Muntaqim|Anthony Bottom (a.k.a. Jalil Muntaqim)]], Albert Washington, Francisco Torres, Gabriel Torres, and Herman Bell.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Solomont, [http://www.nysun.com/new-york/new-arrests-in-a-decades-old-slaying-of-police/47292/ "New Arrests in a Decades-Old Slaying of Police Officers"], ''The New York Sun'', January 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29, 1971, three armed men murdered 51-year-old San Francisco police sergeant John Victor Young while he was working at a desk in his police station, which was almost empty at the time due to a bombing attack on a bank that took place earlier - only one other officer and a civilian clerk were there. Two days later, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' received a letter signed by the BLA claiming responsibility for the attack.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

On November 3, 1971, Officer James R. Greene of the [[Atlanta Police Department]] was shot and killed in his patrol van at a gas station. His wallet, badge, and weapon were taken, and the evidence at the scene pointed to two suspects. The first was [[Twymon Meyers]], who was killed in a police shootout in 1973, and the second was Freddie Hilton (a.k.a. Kamau Sadiki), who evaded capture until 2002, when he was arrested in New York City on a separate charge, and was recognized as one of the men wanted in the Greene murder. Apparently, the two men had attacked the officer to gain standing with their compatriots within Black Liberation Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fultonda.org/featuredarticle/30years.htm|format=PDF|title=Office of Fulton County District Attorney Paul L. Howard, Jr.|website=Fultonda.org|accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, 1972, the Black Liberation Army assassinated police officers Gregory Foster and Rocco Laurie at the corner of 174 Avenue B in New York City. After the killings, a note sent to authorities portrayed the murders as a retaliation for the prisoner deaths during 1971 [[Attica prison riot]]. To date no arrests have been made.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

On July 31, 1972, five armed individuals [[aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] [[Delta Air Lines Flight 841]] en route from [[Detroit]] to [[Miami]], eventually collecting a ransom of $1 million and diverting the plane, after passengers were released, to [[Algeria]]. The authorities there seized the ransom but allowed the group to flee. Four were eventually caught by French authorities in [[Paris]], where they were convicted of various crimes, but one—George Wright—remained a fugitive until September 26, 2011, when he was captured in [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/09/man_who_escaped_from_nj_prison.html|title=Man who escaped from N.J. prison 41 years ago is captured in Portugal|publisher=NJ.com|date=2011-09-26|accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese courts rejected the initial pledge for extradition. American authorities may still appeal this decision.

In another high-profile incident, [[Assata Shakur]], [[Zayd Shakur]] and [[Sundiata Acoli]] were said to have opened fire on state troopers in [[New Jersey]] after being pulled over for a broken taillight. Zayd Shakur and state trooper Werner Foerster were both killed during the exchange. Following her capture, Assata Shakur was tried in six different criminal trials.{{cn|date=February 2017}} According to Shakur, she was beaten and tortured during her incarceration in a number of different federal and state prisons. The charges ranged from kidnapping to assault and battery to bank robbery. Assata Shakur was found guilty of the murder of both Foerster and her companion Zayd Shakur, but escaped prison in 1979 and eventually fled to [[Cuba]] and received political asylum. Acoli was convicted of killing Foerster and sentenced to life in prison.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The BLA was active in the US until at least 1981 when a [[The Brink's Company|Brinks]] [[Brinks robbery (1981)|truck robbery]], conducted with support from former [[Weather Underground]] members [[Kathy Boudin]] and [[David Gilbert (activist)|David Gilbert]], left a guard and two police officers dead. Boudin and Gilbert, along with several BLA members, were subsequently arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/terrorists/brinks/1.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=October 28, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209235659/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/terrorists/brinks/1.html|archivedate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, eight men, labeled the [[San Francisco 8]] were charged by a joint state and federal task force with John Young's murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/01/24/MNGDONO11G1.DTL|title=Ex-militants charged in S.F. police officer's '71 slaying at station|publisher=SFGate|date=2007-01-24|accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants have been identified as former members of the Black Liberation Army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2007/01/black_liberatio.html Black Liberation Army tied to 1971 slaying] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212123434/http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2007/01/black_liberatio.html|date=February 12, 2009}} (via [[USA Today]])&lt;/ref&gt; A similar case was dismissed in 1975 when a judge ruled that police gathered evidence through the use of [[torture]]. On June 29, 2009, Herman Bell pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the death of Sgt. Young. In July 2009, charges were dropped against four of the accused: Ray Boudreaux, Henry W. Jones, Richard Brown and Harold Taylor. That same month, Jalil Muntaquim pleaded no contest to conspiracy to commit voluntary manslaughter becoming the second person to be convicted in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/07/07/BAKJ18JUNS.DTL|title=2nd guilty plea in 1971 killing of S.F. officer|publisher=SFGate|date=2009-07-07|accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarchist turn==
{{Main|Black anarchism}}
Following the collapse of the BLA, some members - including [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Kuwasi Balagoon|Donald Weems (a.k.a. Kuwasi Balagoon)]] and [[Ojore N. Lutalo]] - became outspoken proponents of [[anarchism]]. Weems died in prison of an [[AIDS]]-related disease in 1986. Alston remains active in prison support and other activist circles. Lutalo was released from prison in 2009 after serving 28 years on charges related to a shootout with a drug dealer in 1981 (and parole violation stemming from his conviction for a 1975 bank robbery), during which time he was punished with [[solitary confinement]] for receiving anarchist literature. While incarcerated, the [[Anarchist Black Cross Federation]] gave him support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcf.net/prisoners/lutalo.htm|title=Ojore|website=Abcf.net|accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 2010, he was arrested for endangering public transportation while on the [[Amtrak]] train to New Jersey after attending the [[Anarchist Book Fair]] in Los Angeles, being mistakenly identified as making terrorist threats on his cell phone. The charge was dropped for lack of evidence, and Lutalo settled a suit  against the city of [[La Junta, Colorado]], where his arrest was made, for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cardona|first=Felisa|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_17388873|title=La Junta to settle lawsuit with man who was wrongfully jailed|newspaper=[[The Denver Post]]|accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today's organization==
An organization exists today claiming to be a recreated Black Liberation Army. The group is called the New Black Liberation Militia, a [[black nationalist]] [[paramilitary]] group with [[Fred Hampton, Jr.]] as a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/newblackliberationinstitute/what-is-NBTI|title=WHAT IS THE NBLM - The New Black Liberation Militia|website=Sites.google.com|date=2014-03-17|accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party inline|date=April 2018}}

The term was coined by the media in Bosnia and Herzegovina ahead of the country's [[Bosnian general election, 2010|general election]] in October 2010, and has since been used to refer to similar techniques used during elections in some of the ex-Yugoslavian republics. The name of the method originates from its widespread use during the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Bulgaria)|European Parliament election]] held in Bulgaria in June 2009, at which analysts' estimates indicate that 200,000-350,000 votes were sold or coerced.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://insajder.net/en/site/tema/794/ Was the “Bulgarian train” used to rig the elections?

== Description ==
Bulgarian train is, in fact, a method of [[Electoral fraud#Vote buying|vote-buying]] that includes a recurrent process of casting pre-filled ballots. The process starts when political 'handlers' distribute pre-filled ballots in front of polling stations. The voters who are willing to sell their ballots take them into the polling stations, where they obtain empty ones, and cast their pre-filled. Then, they go back outside and hand the empty ballots to the handlers, who fill in them and give over to the next voters.&lt;ref&gt;S. Latal and Z. Jegdić. "[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/bosnians-turn-election-fraud-into-business-opportunity Bosnians Turn Election Fraud into Business Opportunity]". ''[[Balkan Insight]]''. 13 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
=== Bulgaria ===
The method was massively used in [[Bulgaria]] during the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Bulgaria)|European Parliament election]] in June and the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2009|parliamentary election]] in July 2009. The voters willing to sell their vote were primarily from the [[Romani people in Bulgaria|Roma community]]. Analysts estimate that the number of people who sold or coerced their vote in this way ranges from 200,000-350,000 at each election. Consequently, the name of the method has become eponymous with Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="novinite"/&gt;

=== Macedonia ===
The implementation of the method was reportedly prevented in [[Struga]] during the [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2016|Macedonian parliamentary election]] in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://fokus.mk/duri-i-maloletnitsi-vrshele-pritisok-za-glasane-a-vo-struga-sprechen-obid-za-bugarski-voz/ Дури и малолетници вршеле притисок за гласање, а во Струга спречен обид за бугарски воз]". ''Fokus''. 11 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
The use of the term "Bulgarian train" sparked controversies in Bulgaria, where it is considered offensive and the same technique of vote-rigging is known as "Indian string" (Bulgarian: ''индианска нишка'').&lt;ref&gt;Р. Йорданов, "[http://www.temanews.com/index.php?p=tema&amp;iid=401&amp;aid=9731 Призрак от миналото и индиански нишки]". ''Тема''.&lt;/ref&gt; In a research paper on the vote-rigging in Bulgarian elections published in 2010, Bulgarian political scientist [[Georgi Manolov]] avoids the use of names associated with specific countries. He refers to the fraudulent techniques as 'vote trading' and the recurrent process of vote-rigging simply as 'train'.&lt;ref&gt;Maonolov, Georgi L. (2010). "[http://facta.junis.ni.ac.rs/eao/eao201003/eao201003-05.pdf The "vote trading" phenomenon in Bulgaria]". ''Economics and Organization''. '''7''' (3). pp. 299-308.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:captcha.jpg|thumb|This CAPTCHA (Version 1) of "smwm" obscures its message from computer interpretation by twisting the letters and adding slight background color gradient.]]
A '''CAPTCHA''' ({{IPAc-en|k|æ|p|.|tʃ|ə}}, an [[acronym]] for "'''C'''ompletely '''A'''utomated '''P'''ublic [[Turing test|'''T'''uring test]] to tell '''C'''omputers and '''H'''umans '''A'''part") is a type of [[challenge–response authentication|challenge–response]] test used in [[computing]] to determine whether or not the user is human.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/partners/success-stories/recaptcha.html|title=The reCAPTCHA Project – Carnegie Mellon University CyLab|website=www.cylab.cmu.edu|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined in 2003 by [[Luis von Ahn]], [[Manuel Blum]], Nicholas J. Hopper, and [[John Langford (computer scientist)|John Langford]].&lt;ref name="abhl" /&gt; The most common type of CAPTCHA (displayed as Version 1.0) was first invented in 1997 by two groups working in parallel. The first group consisted of Mark D. Lillibridge, [[Martin Abadi]], [[Krishna Bharat]], and [[Andrei Broder|Andrei Z. Broder]]; the second group consisted of Eran Reshef, [[Gili Raanan]] and Eilon Solan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This form of CAPTCHA requires that the user type the letters of a distorted image, sometimes with the addition of an obscured sequence of letters or digits that appears on the screen. Because the test is administered by a computer, in contrast to the standard Turing test that is administered by a human, a CAPTCHA is sometimes described as a [[reverse Turing test]].

This user identification procedure has received many criticisms, especially from disabled people, but also from other people who feel that their everyday work is slowed down by distorted words that are difficult to read. It takes the average person approximately 10 seconds to solve a typical CAPTCHA.&lt;ref&gt;Bursztein, E., Bethard, S., Fabry, C., Mitchell, J. C., &amp; Jurafsky, D. (n.d.). Retrieved March 30, 2018, from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/burszstein_2010_captcha.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Since the early days of the [[Internet]], users have wanted to make text illegible to computers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The first such people could be [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]], posting about sensitive topics to [[Internet forum]]s they thought were being automatically monitored for keywords. To circumvent such filters, they would replace a word with look-alike characters. ''HELLO'' could become {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;{{!}}-{{!}}3{{!}}_{{!}}_()&lt;/code&gt;}} or {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;)-(3££0&lt;/code&gt;}}, as well as numerous other variants, such that a filter could not possibly detect ''all'' of them. This later became known as [[leet]]speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = h2g2 – An Explanation of l33t Speak – Edited Entry|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A787917|accessdate = 2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest commercial uses of CAPTCHAs was in the '''Gausebeck-Levchin test'''&lt;!-- per [[WP:MOSBOLD]] since the redirect points to this article --&gt;. In 2000, idrive.com began to protect its signup page&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzbOLm20p6CrUE1SSXp5Zjl2MW8|title=idrive turing signup page|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a CAPTCHA and prepared to file a patent&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzbOLm20p6CrOS1mWEhITGJ4d2s|title=idrive turing patent application|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; on this seemingly novel technique. In 2001, [[PayPal]] used such tests as part of a fraud prevention strategy in which they asked humans to "retype distorted text that programs have difficulty recognizing."&lt;ref name=stringham2015&gt;{{cite book |last=Stringham|first1=Edward P |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/private-governance-creating-order-in-economic-and-social-life/oclc/5881934034&amp;referer=brief_results |title=Private Governance : creating order in economic and social life |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2015 |page=105 |isbn=978-0-19-936516-6 |accessdate=2017-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PayPal cofounder and CTO [[Max Levchin]] helped commercialize this early use.

A popular deployment of CAPTCHA technology, reCAPTCHA, was acquired by Google in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teaching computers to read: Google acquires reCAPTCHA|url=https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/teaching-computers-to-read-google.html|website=Google Official Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to preventing bot fraud for its users, Google used reCAPTCHA and CAPTCHA technology to digitize the archives of The New York Times and books from Google Books in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deciphering Old Texts, One Woozy, Curvy Word at a Time|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/science/29recaptcha.html|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, Google has used an image-based CAPTCHA to improve its driverless car data set, identifying objects like trees and crosswalks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=You are building a self driving AI without even knowing about it|url=https://hackernoon.com/you-are-building-a-self-driving-ai-without-even-knowing-about-it-62fadbfa5fdf|website=Hacker Noon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics point to the un-witting participation of the end-user in advancing Google's commercial interests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google is Using You|url=https://hackernoon.com/google-is-using-you-recaptcha-hcaptcha-human-protocol-d911ff51a494|website=Hacker Noon}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In response, competitors have emerged with alternative models including compensation for the website host or end-user for their effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=hCaptcha|url=https://hcaptcha.com|website=hCaptcha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inventorship claims ===

Two teams of people have claimed to be the first to invent the CAPTCHAs used widely on the Web today. The first team consists of Mark D. Lillibridge, [[Martín Abadi]], [[Krishna Bharat]], and [[Andrei Broder]], who used CAPTCHAs in 1997 at [[AltaVista]] to prevent [[Internet bot|bots]] from adding [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] to their [[web search engine]]. Looking for a way to make their images resistant to [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] attack, the team looked at the manual of their [[Brother Industries|Brother]] [[Image scanner|scanner]], which had recommendations for improving OCR's results (similar typefaces, plain backgrounds, etc.). The team created puzzles by attempting to simulate what the manual claimed would cause bad OCR.

The second team to claim inventorship of CAPTCHAs consists of [[Luis von Ahn]], Manuel Blum, Nicholas J. Hopper, and John Langford, who first described CAPTCHAs in a 2003 publication&lt;ref name="abhl" /&gt; and subsequently received much coverage in the popular press. Their notion of CAPTCHA covers any program that can distinguish humans from computers, including many different examples of CAPTCHAs.

The controversy of inventorship has been resolved by the existence of a 1997 priority date patent application by Eran Reshef, [[Gili Raanan]] and Eilon Solan&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004-03-01|title=Method and system for discriminating a human action from a computerized action|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US20050114705A1/en?q=discriminating&amp;q=human&amp;inventor=raanan}}&lt;/ref&gt; who worked at [[Sanctum (company)|Sanctum]] on [[Web application firewall|Application Security Firewall]]. Their patent application details that "The invention is based on applying human advantage in applying sensory and cognitive skills to solving simple problems that prove to be extremely hard for computer software. Such skills include, but are not limited to processing of sensory information such as identification of objects and letters within a noisy graphical environment"; and a 1998 patent by Lillibridge, Abadi, Bharat, and Broder.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent 6,195,698. Method for selectively restricting access to computer systems. Filed on Apr 13, 1998 and granted on Feb 27, 2001. Available at http://www.google.com/patents/US6195698&lt;/ref&gt; Both patents predate other publications by several years, though they do not use the term CAPTCHA, they describe the ideas in detail and precisely depict the graphical CAPTCHAs used in the Web today.

== Characteristics ==
CAPTCHAs are, by definition, fully automated, requiring little human maintenance or intervention to administer, producing benefits in cost and reliability.

The algorithm used to create the CAPTCHA must be made public, though it may be covered by a patent. This is done to demonstrate that breaking it requires the solution to a difficult problem in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) rather than just the discovery of the (secret) algorithm, which could be obtained through [[reverse engineering]] or other means.

Modern text-based CAPTCHAs are designed such that they require the simultaneous use of three separate abilities—invariant recognition, segmentation, and parsing—to correctly complete the task with any consistency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chellapilla|first=Kumar|first2=Kevin|last2=Larson|first3=Patrice|last3=Simard|first4=Mary|last4=Czerwinski|title=Designing Human Friendly Human Interaction Proofs (HIPs)|journal=Microsoft Research|url=https://research.microsoft.com/pubs/101726/HIPSCHI2005.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410195118/http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/101726/HIPSCHI2005.pdf|archivedate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Invariant recognition refers to the ability to recognize the large amount of variation in the shapes of letters. There are nearly an infinite number of versions for each character that a human brain can successfully identify. The same is not true for a computer, and teaching it to recognize all those differing formations is an extremely challenging task.
# Segmentation, or the ability to separate one letter from another, is also made difficult in CAPTCHAs, as characters are crowded together with no white space in between.
# Context is also critical. The CAPTCHA must be understood holistically to correctly identify each character. For example, in one segment of a CAPTCHA, a letter might look like an "m". Only when the whole word is taken into context does it become clear that it is a "u" and an "n".

Each of these problems poses a significant challenge for a computer, even in isolation. The presence of all three at the same time is what makes CAPTCHAs difficult to solve.&lt;ref name=bursz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bursztein|first=Elie|first2=Matthieu|last2=Martin|first3=John C.|last3=Mitchell |title= Text-based CAPTCHA Strengths and Weaknesses |journal=ACM Computer and Communication Security 2011 (ACM Conference CSS'2011)|year=2011 |series=Stanford University |url=https://www.elie.net/publication/text-based-captcha-strengths-and-weaknesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike computers, humans excel at this type of task. While segmentation and recognition are two separate processes necessary for understanding an image for a computer, they are part of the same process for a person. For example, when an individual understands that the first letter of a CAPTCHA is an "a", that individual also understands where the contours of that "a" are, and also where it melds with the contours of the next letter. Additionally, the human brain is capable of dynamic thinking based upon context. It is able to keep multiple explanations alive and then pick the one that is the best explanation for the whole input based upon contextual clues. This also means it will not be fooled by variations in letters.

== Relation to AI ==
While used mostly for security reasons, CAPTCHAs also serve as a benchmark task for artificial intelligence technologies. According to an article by Ahn, Blum and Langford,&lt;ref name=Ahn2003&gt;von Ahn, L;  M. Blum, N. J. Hopper, and J. Langford. (2003) "CAPTCHA: Using Hard AI Problems for Security". ''Proc. Eurocrypt'', pp. 294–311.
&lt;/ref&gt; "any program that passes the tests generated by a CAPTCHA can be used to solve a hard unsolved AI problem."&lt;ref&gt;Moy G, N Jones and C Harkless (2004) "Distortion estimation techniques in solving visual CAPTCHAs", Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.&lt;/ref&gt;

They argue that the advantages of using hard AI problems as a means for security are twofold. Either the problem goes unsolved and there remains a reliable method for distinguishing humans from computers, or the problem is solved and a difficult AI problem is resolved along with it. In the case of image and text based CAPTCHAs, if an AI were capable of accurately completing the task without exploiting flaws in a particular CAPTCHA design, then it would have solved the problem of developing an AI that is capable of complex [[object recognition]] in scenes.&lt;ref name=Ahn2003/&gt;

== Accessibility ==
{{See also|Web accessibility}}
[[File:FancyCaptcha screenshot.png|left|thumb|260px|Many websites require typing a CAPTCHA when creating an account to prevent spam]]

CAPTCHAs based on reading text — or other visual-perception tasks — prevent [[blindness|blind]] or [[visual impairment|visually impaired]] users from accessing the protected resource.&lt;ref name="w3c_inaccessibility"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/ |title=Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA |date=2005-11-23 |accessdate=2015-04-27 |publisher=[[W3C]] |author=May, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, CAPTCHAs do not have to be visual. Any hard [[artificial intelligence]] problem, such as [[speech recognition]], can be used as the basis of a CAPTCHA. Some implementations of CAPTCHAs permit users to opt for an audio CAPTCHA, though a 2011 paper demonstrated a technique for defeating the popular schemes at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bursztein|first=Elie|first2=Romain|last2=Beauxis|first3=Hristo|last3=Perito|first4=Daniele|last4=Paskov|last5=fabry|first5=Celine|last6=Mitchell|first6=John C.|title=The failure of noise-based non-continuous audio captchas|journal= IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&amp;P), 2011|year=2011|url=https://www.elie.net/publication/the-failure-of-noise-based-non-continuous-audio-captchas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For non-sighted users (for example blind users, or color blind people on a color-using test), visual CAPTCHAs present serious problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Shea, Michael |url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/tech/features/captcha-spambots-ebooks-and-the-turing-test |title=CAPTCHA: Spambots, eBooks and the Turing Test |date=19 November 2015 |publisher=[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]] |accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because CAPTCHAs are designed to be unreadable by machines, common [[assistive technology]] tools such as [[screen readers]] cannot interpret them. Since sites may use CAPTCHAs as part of the initial registration process, or even every login, this challenge can completely block access. In certain jurisdictions, site owners could become targets of litigation if they are using CAPTCHAs that discriminate against certain people with disabilities. For example, a CAPTCHA may make a site incompatible with [[Section 508]] in the United States. In other cases, those with sight difficulties can choose to identify a word being read to them.

While providing an audio CAPTCHA allows blind users to read the text, it still hinders those who are both blind and deaf. According to sense.org.uk, about 4% of people over 60 in the UK have both [[deafblindness|vision and hearing impairments]]. There are about 23,000 people in the UK who have serious vision and hearing impairments. According to The National Technical Assistance Consortium for Children and Young Adults Who Are Deaf-Blind (NTAC), the number of deafblind children in the USA increased from 9,516 to 10,471 during the period 2004 to 2012.&lt;ref name=ncc&gt;{{cite web|title=National Child Count Annual Reports |url=http://nationaldb.org/library/page/2199 |date=November 30, 2012 |work=TA&amp;D Network|publisher=National Consortium on Deaf-Blindness|accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallaudet University quotes 1980 to 2007 estimates which suggest upwards of 35,000 fully deafblind adults in the USA.&lt;ref name=dstats&gt;{{cite web |last=Harrington |first=Tom|first2=Jane |last2=Rutherford |title=American deaf-blind population |url=http://libguides.gallaudet.edu/content.php?pid=119476&amp;sid=1029203 |work=Deaf Statistics |publisher=Gallaudet University Library |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deafblind population estimates depend heavily on the degree of impairment used in the definition.

The use of CAPTCHA thus excludes a small number of individuals from using significant subsets of such common Web-based services as PayPal, Gmail, Orkut, Yahoo!, many forum and weblog systems, etc.

Even for perfectly sighted individuals, new generations of graphical CAPTCHAs, designed to overcome sophisticated recognition software, can be very hard or impossible to read.

A method of improving the CAPTCHA to ease the work with it was proposed by ProtectWebForm and was called "Smart CAPTCHA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protectwebform.com/smartcaptcha |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104163541/http://protectwebform.com/smartcaptcha |archivedate=2016-11-04 |title=Smart Captcha |publisher=Protect Web Form .COM |date=2006-10-08 |accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers advise to combine the CAPTCHA with JavaScript support. Since it is too hard for most of spam robots to parse and execute JavaScript, using a simple script which fills the CAPTCHA fields and hides the image and the field from human eyes was proposed.

One alternative method involves displaying to the user a simple mathematical equation and requiring the user to enter the solution as verification. Although these are much easier to defeat using software, they are suitable for scenarios where graphical imagery is not appropriate, and they provide a much higher level of accessibility for blind users than the image-based CAPTCHAs. These are sometimes referred to as MAPTCHAs (M = 'mathematical'). However, these may be difficult for users with a cognitive disorder.

Other kinds of challenges, such as those that require understanding the meaning of some text (e.g., a logic puzzle, trivia question, or instructions on how to create a password) can also be used as a CAPTCHA. Again, there is little research into their resistance against countermeasures.

== Circumvention ==

There are a few approaches to defeating CAPTCHAs: using cheap human labor to recognize them, exploiting bugs in the implementation that allow the attacker to completely bypass the CAPTCHA, and finally using [[machine learning]] to build an automated solver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jakobsson |first=Markus |title=The death of the Internet|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118062418.html|accessdate=4 April 2016|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to former Google "click fraud czar" [[Shuman Ghosemajumder]], there are numerous services which solve CAPTCHAs automatically.&lt;ref name=ai-security&gt;{{cite news |last=Ghosemajumder |first=Shuman |title=The Imitation Game: The New Frontline of Security |url=http://www.infoq.com/presentations/ai-security |agency=InfoQ| accessdate=8 December 2015 |newspaper=InfoQ |date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machine learning-based attacks ===
In its earliest iterations there was not a systematic methodology for designing or evaluating CAPTCHAs.&lt;ref name=bursz /&gt; As a result, there were many instances in which CAPTCHAs were of a fixed length and therefore automated tasks could be constructed to successfully make educated guesses about where segmentation should take place. Other early CAPTCHAs contained limited sets of words, which made the test much easier to game. Still others made the mistake of relying too heavily on background confusion in the image. In each case, algorithms were created that were successfully able to complete the task by exploiting these design flaws. These methods proved brittle however, and slight changes to the CAPTCHA were easily able to thwart them. Modern CAPTCHAs like [[reCAPTCHA]] no longer rely just on fixed patterns but instead present variations of characters that are often collapsed together, making segmentation almost impossible. These newest iterations have been much more successful at warding off automated tasks.&lt;ref name=bursz2 /&gt;

[[File:Modern-captcha.jpg|thumb|An example of a [[reCAPTCHA]] challenge from 2007, containing the words "following finding". The waviness and horizontal stroke were added to increase the difficulty of breaking the CAPTCHA with a computer program.]]
[[File:Captchacat.png|thumb|A CAPTCHA usually has a text box directly underneath where the user should fill out the text that they see. In this case, 'sclt ..was here']]

In October 2013, artificial intelligence company [[Vicarious (Company)|Vicarious]] claimed that it had developed a generic CAPTCHA-solving algorithm that was able to solve modern CAPTCHAs with character recognition rates of up to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Summers|first=Nick|title=Vicarious claims its AI software can crack up to 90% of CAPTCHAs offered by Google, Yahoo and PayPal|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/10/28/vicarious-claims-ai-software-can-now-crack-90-captchas-google-yahoo-paypal/ |publisher=TNW}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Luis von Ahn]], a pioneer of early CAPTCHA and founder of reCAPTCHA, expressed skepticism, stating: "It's hard for me to be impressed since I see these every few months." He pointed out that 50 similar claims to that of Vicarious had been made since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hof |first=Robert |title=AI Startup Vicarious Claims Milestone In Quest To Build A Brain: Cracking CAPTCHA|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2013/10/28/ai-startup-vicarious-claims-milestone-in-quest-to-build-a-brain-craking-captcha/|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014 at Usenix WoOT conference, [[Elie Bursztein|Bursztein]] et al. presented the first generic CAPTCHA-solving algorithm based on reinforcement learning and demonstrated its efficiency against many popular CAPTCHA schemas. They concluded that text distortion based CAPTCHAs schemes should be considered insecure moving forward.&lt;ref name="bursz2" /&gt;

=== Cheap or unwitting human labor ===
It is possible to subvert CAPTCHAs by relaying them to a [[sweatshop]] of human operators who are employed to decode CAPTCHAs. A 2005 paper from a [[W3C]] working group stated that such an operator "could easily verify hundreds of them each hour".&lt;ref name="w3c_inaccessibility" /&gt; In 2010 the [[University of California, San Diego|University of California at San Diego]] conducted a large scale study of those CAPTCHA's farms and found out that the retail price for solving one million CAPTCHAs is as low as $1,000.&lt;ref name="motoyama" /&gt;

Another technique used consists of using a script to re-post the target site's CAPTCHA as a CAPTCHA to a site owned by the attacker, which unsuspecting humans visit and correctly solve within a short while for the script to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2004/01/27/solving_and_creating.html |title=Solving and creating captchas with free porn |last=Doctorow |first=Cory |authorlink=Cory Doctorow |date=2004-01-27 |work=Boing Boing |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209040456/http://www.boingboing.net/2004/01/27/solving_and_creating.html |archivedate=2006-02-09 |accessdate=2015-04-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, there is controversy around the economic viability of such an attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://petmail.lothar.com/design.html#auto34 | title = Hire People To Solve CAPTCHA Challenges | accessdate = 2015-04-27 | date = 2005-07-21 | work = Petmail Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insecure implementation ===
Howard Yeend has identified two implementation issues with poorly designed CAPTCHA systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.puremango.co.uk/cm_breaking_captcha_115.php | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170625165854/http://www.puremango.co.uk/2005/11/breaking_captcha_115/ | archivedate = 2017-06-25 | title = Breaking CAPTCHAs Without Using OCR | accessdate = 2006-08-22 | year = 2005 | work = (pureMango.co.uk)|first=Howard |last=Yeend }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some CAPTCHA protection systems can be bypassed without using [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] simply by reusing the session ID of a known CAPTCHA image
* CAPTCHAs residing on shared servers also present a problem; a security issue on another virtual host may leave the CAPTCHA issuer's site vulnerable

Sometimes, if part of the software generating the CAPTCHA is [[client-side]] (the validation is done on a server but the text that the user is required to identify is rendered on the client side), then users can modify the client to display the un-rendered text. Some CAPTCHA systems use [[MD5]] hashes stored client-side, which may leave the CAPTCHA vulnerable to a [[brute-force attack]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Notable attacks ===
Some notable attacks against various CAPTCHAs schemas include:
* Mori et al. published a paper in [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] CVPR'03 detailing a method for defeating one of the most popular CAPTCHAs, EZ-Gimpy, which was tested as being 92% accurate in defeating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mori/gimpy/mori_gimpy.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403213029/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mori/gimpy/mori_gimpy.pdf |archivedate=2005-04-03 |title=Breaking a Visual CAPTCHA |publisher=Cs.berkeley.edu |date=2002-12-10 |accessdate=2017-09-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same method was also shown to defeat the more complex and less-widely deployed Gimpy program 33% of the time. However, the existence of implementations of their algorithm in actual use is indeterminate at this time.
* PWNtcha has made significant progress in defeating commonly used CAPTCHAs, which has contributed to a general migration towards more sophisticated CAPTCHAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sam.zoy.org/pwntcha/ |title=PWNtcha – Caca Labs |publisher=Sam.zoy.org |date=2009-12-04 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Podec, a trojan discovered by the security company Kaspersky, forwards CAPTCHA requests to an online human translation service that converts the image to text, fooling the system. Podec targets Android mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmagazineuk.com/kaspersky-discovers-captcha-duping-podec-malware/article/1478464|title=Kaspersky discovers CAPTCHA-duping Podec malware|date=2015-03-11|newspaper=SC Magazine UK|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative CAPTCHAs schemas ==
With the demonstration that text distortion based 
CAPTCHAs are vulnerable to machine learning based attacks, some researchers have proposed alternatives including image recognition CAPTCHAs which require users to identify simple objects in the images presented. The argument in favor of these schemes is that tasks like object recognition are typically more complex to perform than text recognition and therefore should be more resilient to machine learning based attacks. Here are some of notable alternative CAPTCHA schemas:
* Chew et al. published their work in the 7th International Information Security Conference, ISC'04, proposing three different versions of image recognition CAPTCHAs, and validating the proposal with user studies. It is suggested that one of the versions, the anomaly CAPTCHA, is best with 100% of human users being able to pass an anomaly CAPTCHA with at least 90% probability in 42 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~tygar/papers/Image_Recognition_CAPTCHAs/imagecaptcha.pdf |title=Image Recognition CAPTCHAs |publisher=Cs.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Datta et al. published their paper in the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Multimedia]] '05 Conference, named IMAGINATION (IMAge Generation for INternet AuthenticaTION), proposing a systematic way to image recognition CAPTCHAs. Images are distorted in such a way that state-of-the-art image recognition approaches (which are potential attack technologies) fail to recognize them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~wangz/project/imsearch/IMAGINATION/ACM05/ |title=Imagination Paper |publisher=Infolab.stanford.edu |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Microsoft (Jeremy Elson, John R. Douceur, Jon Howell, and Jared Saul) have developed Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access (ASIRRA) which ask users to distinguish cats from dogs. Microsoft had a beta version of this for websites to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/asirra-a-captcha-that-exploits-interest-aligned-manual-image-categorization/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215032402/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/asirra/ |archivedate=15 December 2008 |title=Asirra is a human interactive proof that asks users to identify photos of cats and dogs |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They claim "Asirra is easy for users; it can be solved by humans 99.6% of the time in under 30 seconds. Anecdotally, users seemed to find the experience of using Asirra much more enjoyable than a text-based CAPTCHA." This solution was described in a 2007 paper to Proceedings of 14th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/asirra-a-captcha-that-exploits-interest-aligned-manual-image-categorization/ |title=Asirra: A CAPTCHA that Exploits Interest-Aligned Manual Image Categorization}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this project was closed in October 2014 and is no longer available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/asirra/installation.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112032323/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/asirra/installation.aspx |archivedate=12 January 2009 |title=Microsoft's Asirra project closed. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collectivization in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]]''', officially the '''Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic''' was part of the policy of [[Collectivization in the USSR]] and [[dekulakization]] that was pursued between 1928 and 1933  with the purpose to consolidate individual land and labour into collective farms called [[kolkhoz]] and to eliminate [[enemies of the working class]]. The idea of collective farms was seen by peasants as a revival of [[serfdom]].&lt;ref name="SIP"&gt;{{cite book |title=Stalin in Power |last=Tucker |first=Robert |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Norton &amp; Company |location= |isbn=978-0-393-30869-3 |page=195 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L9pcTIEP1OQC&amp;pg=PA195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ukraine this policy had a dramatic effect on the Ukrainian ethnic population and its culture as 86% of the population lived in rural settings. The forceful introduction of the policy of [[collectivization]] was one of the main causes of the [[Holodomor]]. In Ukraine collectivization had specific goals and outcomes. The Soviet policies related to collectivisation have to be understood in the larger context of the social "[[revolution from above]]" that took place in the [[Soviet Union]] at the time.&lt;ref name=Problemy12&gt;С. Кульчицький, Проблема колективізації сільського господарства в сталінській “революції зверху”, ([http://www.history.org.ua/Zbirnyk/12/2.pdf pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527222158/http://www.history.org.ua/Zbirnyk/12/2.pdf |date=2008-05-27 }}) ''Проблеми Історіїї України факти, судження, пошуки'',
№12, 2004, сс. 21-69&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of Collective farms were based on the large village farms in collective ownership of village inhabitants. Estimated yields were expected  to increase by 150%.  The ultimate goal of collectivization was to resolve "grain problems" of the late 1920s.

In the early 1920s only 3% of the peasantry of the Soviet Union were collectivised. Within the first five-year plan 20% of peasant households were to be collectivised, although in Ukraine the number was set at 30%.

Approaches to changing from individual farming to a collective type of agricultural production had existed since 1917, but for various reasons (lack of [[agricultural equipment]], agronomy resources, etc.) were not implemented widely until 1925, when there was a more intensive effort by the agricultural sector to increase the number of agricultural cooperatives and bolster the effectiveness of already existing [[sovkhoz]]es. In late 1927, after the XV Congress of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], then known as the All-Union Communist party ([[bolsheviks]]) or VKP(b), a significant impetus was given to the collectivization effort.

In 1927, a [[drought]] shortened the harvest in southern areas of the Ukraine and [[North Caucasus]]. In 1927–28 the winter tillage area was badly affected due to low snow levels. Despite seed aid from the State, many affected areas were not re-sown. The 1928 harvest was affected by drought in most of the grain producing areas of Ukraine. Shortages in the harvest and difficulties with the supply system invoked difficulties with the food supply in urban areas and destabilized the food supply situation in the USSR in general. In order to alleviate the situation, a system of food rationing was implemented in the second quarter of 1928 initially in [[Odessa]], and later spread to [[Mariupol]], [[Kherson]], [[Kiev]], Dniprelstan ([[Dnipropetrovsk]]), and [[Kharkiv]]. At the beginning of 1929 a similar system was implemented throughout the USSR. Despite the aid from the Soviet Ukrainian and the Central governments, many southern rural areas registered occurrences of malnutrition and in some cases hunger and starvation (the affected areas and thus the amount of required food aid was under-accounted by authorities). Due to the shortage of forage [[livestock]], its numbers were also affected (see table below).
Most of [[kolkhoz]]es and recently refurnished sovkhozes went through these years with few losses, and some were even able to provide assistance to peasants in the more affected areas (seed and grain for food).

===Early stages===

Despite an intense state campaign, collectivization, which was initially voluntary, was not popular amongst peasants: as of early 1929, only 5.6% of Ukrainian peasant households and 3.8% of [[arable land]] was “collectivized”. In the early of 1929, the methods employed by the specially empowered authority “UkrKolhozcenter” changed from a voluntary enrollment to an administrative one. By October 1, 1929, a plan for the creation of kolkhozes was “outperformed” by 239%.  As a result, 8.8% of arable land was “collectivized”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-kolekt-1929.php |title=Колективізація і голод на Україні: 1929-1933.

==="Fast track collectivization"===

The next major step toward "all-over collectivization" took place after an article was published by [[Joseph Stalin]] in ''[[Pravda]]'', in early November 1929.

While “summoned “ by November 10–November 17, 1929 meeting of VKP(b) Central Committee “[[Twenty-Five Thousander]]s" only trained at special short courses, the main driving force of collectivization and ''[[dekulakization]]'' in Ukraine became a "poor peasants committee" (“komnezamy”) and local village councils (''silrady'') where komnezams members had a voting majority.

The USSR Kolhozcenter issued the December 10, 1929, decree on collectivisation of livestock within a 3-month period (draft animals 100%, cattle 100%, pigs 80%, sheep and goats 60%). This drove many peasants to slaughter their livestock.  By January 1, 1930, the percentage of collectivized households almost doubled, to 16.4% of the total number of households.

Despite the infamous January 5, 1930 [[decree]], in which the deadline for the complete collectivization of Ukraine was set for the period from the end of 1931 to the spring of 1932, Ukraine authorities decided to accelerate the completion of the campaign by autumn of 1930. The high expectations of the plan were outperformed by local authorities even without the assistance of the 7500 “[[Twenty-Five Thousander]]s who had reached some areas only by mid-February&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-kolekt-1930.php |title=Колективізація і голод на Україні: 1929-1933. Збірник матеріалів і документів |publisher=Archives.gov.ua |date=1930-01-30 |accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; – by March 70.9% of arable land and 62.8% of peasant households were suddenly collectivized. The “[[Dekulakization]]” plan was also “over-performed”. Almost 200,000 households (3.8% of total peasant households) were affected by the requisition of property, land, and houses. Some of the peasants were arrested and deported “to the north”. Many arrested '[[kulak]]s' and "well-to-do" farmers resettled their families to the [[Urals]] and [[Central Asia]], where they were often exploited in others sectors of the economy, such as timber cutting.&lt;ref&gt;Wheatcroft and Davies&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'kulak' was ultimately applied to anybody resisting collectivization as many of the so-called 'kulaks' were no more well-off than other peasants.

==="Dizzy with success"===

The fast-track to collectivization incited numerous peasant revolts in Ukraine and in other parts of the USSR. In response to the situation, the Soviet regime stepped back: the March 2, 1930, issue of "Pravda" published the Stalin's article "Dizzy with success". Soon, numerous orders and decrees were issued banning the use of force and administrative methods. Some of “mistakenly dekulakized” received their property back, and even some mistakenly deported returned home but in insignificant numbers-–most remained where they had been deported.  The collectivization process was rolled back: by 1 May 1933 38.2% of Ukrainian peasant households and 41.1% of arable land had been collectivized. By the end of August, these numbers declined to 29.2% and 35.6% respectively.

===Second forced "voluntary" collectivization===

A second forced "voluntary" collectivization campaign was initiated in the winter–summer of 1931 with significant assistance of the so-called "tug-brigades" composed from kolkhoz [[udarnik]]s. Many "kulaks" along with families were deported from Ukraine.

According to declassified data, around 300,000 peasants in Ukraine out of a population of about 30 million were subject to these policies in 1930–31. Ukrainians composed 15% of the total 1.8 million 'kulaks' relocated Soviet-wide.&lt;ref name="DW490"&gt;Davies and Wheatcroft, p.490&lt;/ref&gt; On July 20, 1931 – as a response to the numerous regional requests for additional numbers of kulak deportations Politburo of VKP (b) concluded that the “strategic task of the Party was almost accomplished. All further deportations were recommended to be administered only to individuals.”&lt;ref&gt;Ivnitskyy "Tragedy of Soviet Village"&lt;/ref&gt;

This second forced "voluntary" collectivization campaign also invoked a delay in sowing. As a result, [[cereal crops]] were heavily affected by the 1931 drought. During winter and spring of 1930–31, the Ukrainian agricultural authority "Narkomzem" Ukrainian SRR issued several reports about the significant decline of livestock and especially draft-animal power caused by poor treatment, absence of [[forage]], stables/farms and due the "kulaks sabotage".

According to the [[first five-year plan]], Ukrainian agriculture was to switch from an exclusive orientation of grain to a more diverse output. This included not only a rise in [[sugar beet]] crops, but also other types of agricultural production were expected to be utilised by industry (with even cotton plants being established in 1931). This plan anticipated a decrease in the area of grain cultivated, in contrast to an increase of yield and area for other crops.  By July 1, 1931, 65.7% of Ukrainian peasant households and 67.2% of arable land were reported as "collectivized". The main grain and sugar beet production areas, however, were collectivized to a greater extent — 80-90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-kolekt-1931.php |title=Колективізація і голод на Україні: 1929-1933.

===Clarified “All-over collectivization”===

The Decree of Central Committee of VKP(b) from August 2, 1931 clarified the “all-over collectivization” term - in order to be considered complete the “all-over collectivization” does not have to reach “100%”, but not less than 68–70% of peasants households and not less than 75-80% of arable lands. According to the same decree “all-over collectivization” accomplished at Northern Caucasus (Kuban) - 88% of households and 92% of arable lands “collectivized”, Ukraine (South) – 85 and 94 percents respectively,  Ukraine (Right Bank) – 69 and 80 percents respectively, and Moldavian ASRR (part of Ukrainian SRR) – 68 and 75 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Compendium of Soviet Law for 1931.

As of the beginning of October 1931, the  collectivization of 68.0% of peasant households, and 72.0% of arable land was complete.&lt;ref name="UHJ2004-2"&gt;С.В. Кульчицький, Опір селянства суцільній колективізації, ''[[Ukrainian Historical Journal]]'', 2004, № 2, 31-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1931 Plan===

The plan for the state grain collection in  Ukraine adopted for 1931 was over-optimistic — 510 million [[pood]]s (8.4 [[Orders of magnitude (mass)|Tg]]). Drought, administrative distribution of the plan for kolkhozes, together with the lack of relevant management generally destabilized the situation. Significant amounts of grain remained unharvested. A significant percentage was lost during processing and transportation, or spoiled at elevators (wet grain). The total Winter sowing area shrunk by approximately 2 million hectares. Livestock in kolkhozes remained without forage, which was collected under grain procurement. A similar occurrence happened with respect to seeds and wages awarded in kind for kolhoz members. Nevertheless, grain collection continued till May 1932 but reached only 90% of expected plan figures. By the end of December 1931, the collection plan was accomplished by 79%. Many kolkhozes from December 1931 onwards suffered from lack of food, resulting in an increased number of deaths caused by malnutrition registered by OGPU in some areas (Moldavia as a whole and several central rayons of [[Vinnytsia]], Kiev and North-East rayons of [[Odessa]] oblasts)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-Pyrig-1932.php |title=Голод 1932-1933 років на Україні: очима істориків, мовою документів |publisher=Archives.gov.ua |date= |accessdate=2013-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815104813/http://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-Pyrig-1932.php |archive-date=2012-08-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in winter-spring and the early summer months of 1932. By 1932 the sowing campaign of Ukraine was obtained with minimal power as most of the remaining horses were incapable of working, while the number of available agricultural tractors was too small to fill the gap.

[[File:plan1932UKRSSR.jpg|thumb|Article from a Soviet newspaper with the first version of a plan for grain collections in 1932 for kolkhozes and peasants - 5,831.3 thousand tons + sovkhozes 475,034 tons]]

Speculative prices on food in the cooperative network (5–10 times more as compared with neighboring Soviet republics) invoked a significant movement of peasants in search for bread. Attempts were made to manage the problem with bread speculation by imposing a quota on all carried foods met with very limited success. On the request of [[Stanislav Kosior|Kosior]] such provisions were lifted by Stalin at the end of May 1932. The July GPU reports for the first half of 1932, mentioned the “difficulties with food” in 127 rayons (out of 484), acknowledged the fact that they did not have information for all regions. The Decree of Sovnarkom  on “Kolkhoz Trade” issued in May, fostered rumors amongst peasants that collectivization was once again rolled-back as it had been in the spring 1930. As a result, the number of peasants who abandoned the kolkhozes significantly increased.

===1932 situation===

The Government of the Ukrainian SSR tried to remedy the situation from March with recourse to internal resources, but had little success - withdrawal of food from other Ukrainian regions depleted their own limited supplies. Starting in February 1932, administrative and territorial reform (oblast creation) also added mismanagement cast, - even Moscow had more details about the seed situation than the Ukrainian authorities. In May, in a desperate effort to change the situation, the central Soviet Government provided 7.1 million [[pood]]s of grain for food for Ukraine and reverted no less than 700 agricultural tractors intended for other regions of USSR. By July, the total amount of aid provided from Central Soviet Authorities for food, sowing and forage for “agricultural sector” was numbered more than 17 million poods.

Taking into account the situation in Ukraine, the central grain collection plan was lowered by 18.1%, in comparison to the 1931 plan. Kolkhozes were expected to harvest 4,751.2  thousand tons, with the peasants responsible for 1,080.1 thousand tons. Sovkhozes were to submit 475,034 tons. In addition Ukrainian kolkhozes and sovkhozes were to return 132,750 tons of grain which had been provided in spring 1932 as aid. The grain collection plan for July 1932 was adopted to collect 19.5 million [[pood]]s.

The actual state of collection was disastrous however, and by 31 July only 3 million poods (compared to 21 million in 1931) were collected. As of July 20 the harvested area was half of that in 1931. The sovhozes had only sowed 16% of the defined area.

This disparity between agricultural goals, and actual production grew later in the year. An expected 190 thousand tons of grain were to be exported, but by August 27, 1932, only 20 thousand tons were ready. Ukraine met with difficulty in supplying the planned amount of food and as a result a rationing system was implemented to supply urban areas with food. This system became the major source of food delivery to cities while the alternatives, cooperative trade and black market trading, became too expensive, and under-supplied, to provide long-range assistance.  By October 25, the plan for grain collection was lowered once again, from the quantity called for in the plan of August 22, 1932. Nevertheless, collection reached only 39% of the annually planned total.&lt;ref&gt;С. Кульчицький, Голодомор-33: сталінський задум та його виконання ([http://www.history.org.ua/Zbirnyk/15/10.pdf pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527222215/http://www.history.org.ua/Zbirnyk/15/10.pdf |date=2008-05-27 }}), ''Проблеми Історіїї України факти, судження, пошуки'', №15, 2006, сс. 190-264&lt;/ref&gt; A second lowering of goals deducted 70 million poods but still demanded plan completion, and 100% efficiency. Attempts to reach the new goals of production proved futile in late 1932. On November 29, in order to complete the plan, Ukraine was to collect 94 million poods, 4.8 of them from sovkhozes. As of January 2, targets were again lowered, to 62.5 million poods. Later that month, on January 14,the targets were lowered  even further– by 29.4 million poods, to 33.1 million. Vinnytsia, Kiev oblasts and Moldavian SRR had accomplished the lowered 1932 plan for grain procurement, but not for sowing reserves. The total remains for Ukraine was 22.1 million poods. At same time, GPU of Ukraine reported hunger and starvation in the [[Kiev Oblast|Kiev]] and  [[Vinnytsia Oblast|Vinnytsia]] oblasts, and began implementing measures to remedy the situation. By January 29 [[Kharkiv Oblast]] had also fulfilled the grain collection plan, and reached its production target. Despite these apparent successes in production, the total amount of grain collected by February 5 was only 255 million poods (compared to 440 million poods in 1931) while the numbers of “hunger and malnutrition cases” as registered by the GPU of Ukraine, increased every day, particularly in rural areas and small towns.

By early 1932, 69% of households were collectivized.&lt;ref name="DW487"&gt;[[R. W. Davies]], [[Stephen G. Wheatcroft]], "The Years of Hunger: Soviet Agriculture, 1931-1933 (The Industrialization of Soviet Russia)", Palgrave Macmillan, 2004, {{ISBN|0-333-31107-8}}. p.487&lt;/ref&gt; Even though several other regions in the USSR were collectivized to a greater extent,&lt;ref name="DW487ibid"&gt;e.g. 83% in Lower Volga, Davies and Wheatcroft, ''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; the effect of the collectivization on the Ukrainian agriculture was very substantial.

Whilst the long-lasting effect of overall collectivization had an adverse effect on agricultural output everywhere, Ukraine had long been the most agriculturally productive area, providing over 50% of exported grain and 25% of total production of grain in the [[Russian Empire]] in 1913. Over 228,936 square kilometres (56.571 million acres), 207,203&amp;nbsp;km² (51.201 million acres) were used for grain production, or 90.5% of total arable land. This degree of dependency on agriculture meant that the effects of a bad harvest could be almost unlimited. This had been long recognised, and while projections for agricultural production were adjusted, the shock of limited production could not be easily managed. While collections by the state were in turn, limited, there were already clear stresses. The 1932 total Soviet harvest, was to be 29.5 million tons in state collections of grain out of 90.7 million tons in production. But the actual result was a disastrous 55-60 million tons in production. The state ended up collecting only 18.5 million tons in grain.&lt;ref name="DW448"&gt;Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 448&lt;/ref&gt; The total Soviet collections by the state were virtually the same in 1930 and 1931 at about 22.8 million tons. For 1932, they had significantly been reduced to 18.5 million tons; with even lower figure in Ukraine. These were the total estimated outcomes of the grain harvests:&lt;ref name="DW448" /&gt;

===Procurement practice ===

In 1928, a "by contract" policy of procurement (contracts for the delivery of agricultural products) was implemented for kolkhozes and ordinary peasants alike ("kulaks" had a "firm" plan for procurement) . Accordingly, from 1928 through January 1933, "grain production areas" were required to submit 1/3–1/4 of their estimated yield, while areas designated as "grain" were required to submit no more than 1/8 of their estimated yield. However, between the Autumn of 1930 and the Spring of 1932, local authorities tended to collect products from kolkhozes in amounts greater than the minimum required in order to exceed the contracted target (in some cases by more than 200%). Especially harmful methods utilized in the "by contract" policy were "counterplan" actions, which were additional collection plans implemented in already fulfilled contracts. Such "counterplan" measures were strictly forbidden after the Spring of 1933 as "extremely harmful for kolkhoz development."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Soviet Agricultural Encyclopedia'', 1st ed. (1932-35), Moscow&lt;/ref&gt;	 
	 
In 1932 a "1/4 of yield" procurement quota for "grain production areas" of Ukraine were planned for implementation. On September 23, 1932, a telegram signed by Molotov and Stalin noted that the harvest of 1932 was "satisfactory", according to estimates provided by the agricultural planning authorities, and therefore requests for seed for winter crops were refused while total winter-tillage area demands were increased.&lt;ref name="archives1932"/&gt; Later, Stalin blamed the statistical and planning authorities for inaccurately estimating potential yields and thus a "Commissions for yield estimation" was created on December 17, 1932 by his order.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Soviet Agricultural Encyclopedia'', 2nd ed. (1939), Moscow&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern historians also agree that the 1932 harvest figures provided at the time were largely overestimated and the actual difference between estimated and actual harvest was significant. Such unrealistic figures resulted in demand that was impossibly to fulfill and resulted in lesser reduction of grain procurement plan and greater grain procurement then were possible in late 1932 through the February 5, 1933&lt;ref&gt;S.

===Legislation provisions===
On August 7, 1932, the Soviet government passed a law "on the safekeeping of Socialist property"&lt;ref name="TICirc"&gt;Konchalovsky and Lipkov, The Inner Circle, [[Newmarket Press]], New York: 1991, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; that imposed from a ten-year prison sentence to the death penalty for any theft of socialist property.&lt;ref name="TICirc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potocki, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Serczyk, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gregorovich, [http://www.faminegenocide.com/resources/genocide/index.html#4 "Genocide in Ukraine 1933", part 4: "How Did Stalin Organize the Genocide?"], Ukrainian Canadian Research &amp; Documentation Centre, Toronto 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin personally appended the stipulation: "People who encroach on socialist property should be considered [[Enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]."{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Within five months after passage of the law, 54,645 individuals were sentenced under its provisions, of which, 2,110 were sentenced to death.

The existed practice of administrative punishment known as “black board” (black list) by the  November, 18 Decree of Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine was applied to a greater extent and with more harsh methods to selected villages and kolkhozes that were considered to be "underperforming" in the grain collection procurement: “Immediate cessation of delivery of goods, complete suspension of cooperative and state trade in the villages, and removal of all available goods from cooperative and state stores”. Full prohibition of collective farm trade for both collective farms and collective farmers, and for private farmers. Cessation of any sort of credit and demand for early repayment of credit and other financial obligations.”&lt;ref&gt;Rajca, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grainmemo"&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/k2grain.html Memorandum on Grain Problem], Addendum to the minutes of Politburo [meeting] No. 93.

For peasants, who were not kolkhoz members and who were "underperforming" in the grain collection procurement, special “measures” were adopted. To “reach the grain procurement quota” amongst peasants 1,100 brigades were organized which consisted of activists (often from neighboring villages) which had accomplished their grain procurement quota or were close to accomplishing it. Since most of goods supplied to the rural areas was commercial (fabrics, matches, fuels) and was sometimes obtained by villagers from neighbored cities or railway stations, sanctioned villages remained for a long period – as an example mentioned in the December 6 Decree the village of Kamyani Potoky was removed from blacklist only October 17, 1933 when they completed their plan for grain collection early. Since January 1933 the black list regime was “softened” when 100% of plan execution was no longer demanded, mentioned in the December 6 Decree villages Liutenky and Havrylivka were removed from the black list after 88 and 70% of plan completion respectively.&lt;ref name="Archives.gov.ua"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-Pyrig-1933.php |title=Голод 1932-1933 років на Україні: очима істориків, мовою документів |publisher=Archives.gov.ua |date= |accessdate=2013-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109210644/http://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-Pyrig-1933.php |archive-date=2017-11-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measures were undertaken to persecute those withholding or bargaining grain. This was done frequently by requisition detachments, which raided farms to collect grain, and was done regardless of whether the peasants retained enough grain to feed themselves, or whether they had enough seed left to plant the next harvest.

===Restrictions on freedom of movement===
Special barricades were set up by [[State Political Directorate|GPU]] units throughout the USSR to prevent an exodus of peasants from the hunger-stricken regions. During a single month in 1933, 219,460 people were intercepted and escorted back or arrested and sentenced.&lt;ref name="black book"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1999. {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ukraine, these measures had the following results, according to the declassified documents&lt;ref&gt;http://ssu.kmu.gov.ua/sbu/doccatalog/document?id=52383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ssu.kmu.gov.ua/sbu/doccatalog/document?id=52384&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ssu.kmu.gov.ua/sbu/doccatalog/document?id=52385&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ssu.kmu.gov.ua/sbu/doccatalog/document?id=52386&lt;/ref&gt; during the 11 days (23 January–2 February) after the January 22, 1933 Decree 3861 people were intercepted of which 340 were arrested "for further recognition". During the same period, in trains and at railway stations on the whole Ukrainian territory, there were 16,773 people intercepted (907 of those not living in Ukraine); out of those, 1,610 people were arrested. Such figures also included criminals. In the same document, the [[State Political Directorate|OGPU]]  informed about the number of peasants which already had left the Ukrainian territory  (94,433 persons) during the period from December 15, 1932 to January 2, 1933 (data for 215 districts out of 484,  and Moldavian ASRR).

The government introduced new identity papers and obligatory registration for citizens in December 1932.&lt;ref name="black book"/&gt; Initially, the area of new identity papers and obligatory registration implementation were limited to Moscow and Leningrad (encircling 100&amp;nbsp;km ) and [[Kharkiv]] (encircling 50&amp;nbsp;km) and the new measures were planned for implementation by June 1933. Travel from Ukraine and the Northern Caucasus ([[Kuban]]) kray (region) was ''specifically'' forbidden by directives of January 22, 1933 (signed by Molotov and Stalin) and of January 23, 1933 (joint directive [[VKP(b)]] [[Central Committee]] and [[Sovnarkom]]). The directives stated that the travels "for bread" from these areas were organized by enemies of the Soviet power with the purpose of agitation in northern areas of the USSR against kolkhozes, same as it happened last year (1932) from Ukraine, but were not prevented.  Therefore, railway tickets were to be sold only by ''[[ispolkom]]'' permits, and those who already reached the north should be arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Martin, The Affirmative Action Empire: Nations and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939., Ithaca. N.I., 2001, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:HolodomorUcrania9.jpg|thumb|Street in [[Kharkiv]], 1932]]

===Information blockade===
On February 23, 1933 Politburo of VKP(b) Central Committee adopted a decree “About foreign journalists travel through USSR” which expected what they can be travel and reside in mentioned areas only after approval and obtained a permit from General Directorate of Militia".   The Soviet government denied initial reports of the famine (but agreed with information about malnutrition), and prevented foreign journalists from traveling in the region. At the same time there was no credible evidence of information blockade arrangements on a considerable number of foreign specialists (engineers, workers, etc.) which engaged at many construction site at Ukrainian territory.

For example, [[Gareth Jones (journalist)|Gareth Jones]], one of [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George’s]] private secretaries spent several days in mid-March in travel “all twenty villages, not only in the Ukraine, but also in the black earth district, and in the Moscow region, and that I slept in peasants' cottages, and did not immediately leave for the next village”. He easily reached neighboring rural areas of capital of Soviet Ukraine – Kharkov, spent some days there and despite what he has not “saw in the villages no dead human beings nor animals” this journalist who never before saw a famine evidence, reported “that there was famine in the Soviet Union” (actually increasing of death rate from starvation wider affected Kharkov Oblasts in mid April-begin of June 1933).

On August 23, 1933 foreign correspondents were warned individually by the press section of the Foreign Office of USSR not to attempt to travel to the provinces or elsewhere in the Soviet Union without first obtaining formal permission. Foreign Office of USSR without explanation refused permission to William H. Chamberlain, Christian Science Monitor correspondent, to visit and observe the harvest in the principal agricultural regions of the North Caucasus and Ukraine. Several months (May–July 1933) ago two other American correspondents were forbidden to make a trip to Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ruslan V.

Scholars who have conducted research in declassified archives have reported&lt;ref name="DW424"&gt;Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; "the Politburo and regional Party committees insisted that immediate and decisive action be taken in response to the famine such that 'conscientious farmers' not suffer, while district Party committees were instructed to supply every child with milk and decreed that those who failed to mobilize resources to feed the hungry or denied hospitalization to famine victims be prosecuted."

Based on data collected by undercover investigation and photos, the [[Bohemia]]n-[[Austria]]n [[Catholic]] [[Theodor Cardinal Innitzer]] by the end of 1933 made campaigns of awareness in the [[Western World|West]] about the massive deaths by hunger and even cases of [[cannibalism]] that were occurring in Ukraine and the North Caucasus at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746864,00.html Starvation &amp; Surplus], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', January 22, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insufficient assistance===
[[File:GolodomorKharkiv.jpg|thumb|left|Starved peasants on a street in [[Kharkiv]], 1933]]

First reports about difficulties with food (malnutrition, hunger) in rural areas and same situation in towns (which undersupplied through rationing system) from Ukrainian GPU and Oblasts Authorities referred to beginning, mid-January 1933. “Measures to localize the cases” predominantly based on locally available resources. While the numbers of such reports and areas mentioned in them increased (as also a quantity of food requested ) Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine issued a February 8, 1933  Decree which urged what every “hunger case” should be treated without delay and with maximum mobilization of own resources of kolkhozes, rayons, towns, and oblasts". Also that decree demanded “within 7 days term” an information about food aid which should be provided from “central sources”. As of February 20, 1933 Dnipropetrovska oblast - reported as most affected – received 1.2 million  of [[pood]]s of food aid, Odeska – 0.8 million, Kharkovska – 0.3 million accordingly  to the Order of Central Committee of VKP (b). For Kievska oblast by March, 18 Decree of  VKP (b) was allocated 6 million of poods. Ukrainian Authorities also provide the aid but it was limited to resources available.  In order to preserve orphaned and affected by hunger children Ukrainian GPU and Peoples Commissariat of Heals created special commission; was established a kindergartens network were children should get an additional food (sugar, oils, products from grain), specially directed for him from Central Ukrainian and Soviet authorities.  Urban areas also significantly affected by shortage food supplied predominantly through of rationing system.  March 20, 1933 Stalin sign a decree which lowered the monthly milling levy for Ukraine by 14 thousand tons, which amount should be redistributed as additional bread supply “for students, small towns and small enterprises in big cities and specially in Kiev”.

However food aid distribution was not relevantly managed and redistributed by regional and local authorities, even not spoken about differences in amount required and amount provided.

Overturning the first wave of hunger in February – March Ukrainian authorities met with second even worst wave of hunger in starvation in April- May – especially in [[Kiev Oblast|Kiev]] and [[Kharkiv Oblast|Kharkiv]] oblasts (delayed winter also add additional casts to that regions situation.)

Between February and June 1933, at least thirty-five Politburo decisions and Sovnarkom decrees selectively authorized issue of a total of 35.19 million [[pood]]s (576,400  [[tonne]]s)&lt;ref name="Archives.gov.ua"/&gt; or more than half of total aid to whole Soviet agriculture - 1.1 million ton provided by Central soviet Authorities in winter-spring 1933  - of grain for food, seeds and forage for Ukrainian peasants, kolhozes and sovhozes.  Such figures do not  include grain and flour aid provided for urban population, children and aid from local sources. Stalin personally authorized distribution of aid in the case of a request by [[Michail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov]], whose own district was stricken.&lt;ref name="DW217"&gt;On April 6, 1933, Sholokhov, who lived in the Vesenskii district (Kuban, Russian Federation), wrote at length to Stalin, describing the famine conditions and urging him to provide grain. Stalin received the letter on April 15, and on April 16 the Politburo granted 700 tons of grain to the district. Stalin sent a telegram to Sholokhov "We will do everything required. Inform size of necessary help. State a figure." Sholokhov replied on the same day, and on April 22, the day on which Stalin received the second letter, Stalin scolded him, "You should have sent answer not by letter but by telegram. Time was wasted". Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stalin also reprimanded Sholokhov for failing to recognize "sabotage" within his district. This was the only instance that a specific amount of aid was given a specific district.&lt;ref name="DW217" /&gt; Other appeals were not as successful and many desperate pleas were cut back or rejected.&lt;ref name="DW218"&gt;Davies and Wheatcroft, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents from the Soviet archives indicate that the aid distribution was made selectively to the most affected areas and from the spring months such assistance has the goal of the relief effort at sowing time was targeted to recovering patients. A special resolution of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine]] for the [[Kiev Oblast]], from March 31, 1933, ordered dividing peasants hospitalized into ailing and recovering patients. The resolution ordered improving the nutrition of the latter within the limits of available resources so that they could be sent out into the fields to sow the new crop as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="CCresolution"&gt;CC C(b)PU resolution cited through [[Stanislav Kulchytsky]], "[http://www.day.kiev.ua/153455/ Why did Stalin exterminate the Ukrainians?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209185612/http://www.day.kiev.ua/153455/ |date=December 9, 2007 }}", ''[[Den (newspaper)|Den']]'', 29 November 2005 at same time original document mentioned by Kulchytsky does not have any "distrophy" wording, and was issued for only one region, not all of Ukraine—[https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-Pyrig-1933.php doc # 204] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109210644/http://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-Pyrig-1933.php |date=2017-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The food was dispensed according to special resolutions from the government bodies, and additional food was given in the field where the laborers worked.

===Export of grain===

After recognition of the famine situation in Ukraine during the drought and poor harvests, the Soviet government in [[Moscow]] continued to export grain rather than retain its crop to feed the people,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=c-8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity - Page 1056] {{ISBN|0-02-865848-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though on a significantly lower level than in previous years. In 1930–31 there had been 5,832,000 tons{{Vague|date=March 2008}} of grains exported  In 1931–32, grain exports declined to 4,786,000 tons. In 1932–33, grain exports were just 1,607,000 tons and in 1933–34, this further declined to 1,441,000 tons.&lt;ref name="DW471"&gt;Davies and Wheatcroft, p.471&lt;/ref&gt; Officially published data&lt;ref&gt;СССР в цифрах ЦУНХУ Госплана СССР.

===Sovkhozes and general problems of 1932===
[[File:Radgosp.jpg|thumb|Ukraine Sovkhozes delivery of meat, milk and eggs in 1932-34]] 	

After grain collection difficulties in 1927 and 1928, Stalin ordered the creation of state grain and meat enterprises – sovkhozes - which, accordingly to his initial vision, should deliver more than 100 million of poods of grain in 1932. However, in 1932 their production results were disastrous because of poor general and agricultural management and planning, despite the significant (as compared to kolkhozes) amount of modern agricultural mechanisms (agricultural tractors, harvesters, etc.) employed.&lt;ref&gt;Development of the Ukrainian SRR Economy. Kyiv-1949 Ukrainian Academy of Science publishing&lt;/ref&gt; But the biggest reason was that they continually seed wheat from 1929 on the same areas and even without fertilizers. Sovkhozes also suffered from a lack of manpower and infrastructure (roads, elevators etc.). Losses during harvesting were extremely high.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
Thus despite an expected 290 millions of poods (more than 5 million tons) in 1932, sovkhozes produced 5 time less, while the situation with livestock was even worse.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As of July 20, 1932 sovhozes of the Ukrainian SRR had only logged a mere 16% of the defined sawing area.

===Primitive agriculture===
Another factor in the decline of the harvests were the shortage of drought power for ploughing and reaping was even more acute in 1932 than in the previous year. The number of working horses declined from 19.5 million on July 1, 1931 to 16.2 million on July 1, 1932. The desperate efforts to replace horses by tractors failed to compensate for this loss. In 1931, the total supply of tractors to agriculture amounted to {{convert|964000|hp|abbr=on}}, 393,000 produced at home and 578,000 imported. But in 1932, because of the foreign trade crisis and home producing establishing, no tractors at all were imported.&lt;ref name="DW111"&gt;Davies and Wheatcroft, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

In the whole of 1932, only 679,000 tractor horsepower was supplied to agriculture, considerably less than in 1931. Only about half became available in time for the harvest, and even less in time for the spring sowing. Animal drought power deteriorated in quality. Horses were fed and maintained even more inadequately than in the previous year.&lt;ref name="DW111"/&gt; The acute shortage of horses led to the notorious decision to employ cows as working animals. According to the speech of one Soviet official at one of the most affected by famine region, the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]] "in 1932 we employ only 9000 cows, but in 1933 we involve at least 3/4 of their total number; 57000 employed at sowing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Famine/Publicat/Fam-Silgosp.php |title=З доповіді І.

They can spend funds to influence [[election]]s, but are not required to disclose their donors.&lt;ref name=CRP-PN&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2015 |title=Political Nonprofits |url=https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/nonprof_summ.php |website=opensecrets.org |publisher=Center for Responsive Politics |access-date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maguire"&gt;Robert Maguire, [https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2014/04/how-2014-is-shaping-up-to-be-the-darkest-money-election-to-date/ How 2014 Is Shaping Up to be the Darkest Money Election to Date], Center for Responsive Politics (April 30, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Dark money first entered politics with ''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'' (1976) when the [[United States Supreme Court]] laid out [[Eight Magic Words]] that define the difference between electioneering and issue advocacy.

According to the [[Center for Responsive Politics]], "spending by organizations that do not disclose their donors has increased from less than $5.2 million in 2006 to well over $300 million in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential cycle]] and more than $174 million in the [[United States elections, 2014|2014 midterms]]."&lt;ref name="CRP-PN"/&gt; The'' [[New York Times]]'' editorial board has opined that the 2014 midterm elections were influenced by "the greatest wave of secret, special-interest money ever raised in a congressional election."&lt;ref name="DarkMoney2014"&gt;Editorial, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/opinion/sunday/dark-money-helped-win-the-senate.html Dark Money Helped Win the Senate], ''New York Times'' (November 8, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term was first used by the [[Sunlight Foundation]] to describe undisclosed funds that were used during the United States 2010 mid-term election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2010/10/18/daily-disclosures-10| title=Daily Disclosures | author=Allison, Bill | date=October 18, 2010 | accessdate=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/quarterly-filings-fec-reveals-big-power-behind-big-money | title= Dark money: Super PACs fueled by $97.5 million that can't be traced to donors Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group | date= October 20, 2010 | author=Sibley, Ryan }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of the usage of the term "dark money" can be seen in a letter of resignation to President Donald Trump, by former Federal Election Commissioner (FEC), Ann Ravel: “Since 2010, well over $800 million in dark money has been spent in competitive races. At the same time, elections have become more and more expensive. Most of the funding comes from a tiny, highly unrepresentative part of the population.”&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/@AnnMRavel/departing-the-federal-election-commission-fee0ae9d63a1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and influence==
The rise of dark money groups was aided by the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in ''[[FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.]]'' (2008) and ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' (2010).&lt;ref name="Maguire" /&gt;  In ''Citizens United'', the Court ruled (by a 5–4 vote) that corporations and unions could spend unlimited amounts of money to advocate for or against political candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Beckel &amp; Jared Bennett, [http://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/01/21/16626/12-ways-citizens-united-has-changed-politics 12 ways 'Citizens United' has changed politics: Center for Public Integrity investigations illuminate political 'dark money'] (January 21, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In some elections, dark money groups have surpassed traditional [[political action committee]]s (PAC) and "super PACs" (independent-expenditure-only committees) in the volume of spending.&lt;ref name="Maguire"/&gt; In 2012, [[Freedom Partners]] had the ninth-highest revenues among all U.S. trade associations which filed tax returns that year, more than "established heavyweights" such as the [[American Petroleum Institute]], [[PhRMA]], and [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]].&lt;ref name="Maguire" /&gt; Freedom Partners largely acted as a conduit for campaign spending; of the $238 million it spent in 2012, 99 percent went to other groups, and Freedom Partners itself did not have any employees.&lt;ref name="Maguire" /&gt; This was a major distinction between other high-revenue trade associations, which typically have many employees and devote only about 6 percent of spending to grants to outside groups.&lt;ref name="Maguire" /&gt; In 2014, Freedom Partners was identified as the "poster child" for the rise of dark money.&lt;ref name="Maguire"/&gt; The largest and most complex network of dark money groups are funded by conservative billionaire business magnates [[Political activities of the Koch brothers|Charles and David Koch]]; the Koch brothers' network accounted for about a quarter of dark money spending in 2012.&lt;ref name="Maguire" /&gt;

Approaching the 2018 midterm elections, in mid-September, just 15 groups accounted for three-quarters of the anonymous cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/09/12/three-quarters-secret-political-money-comes-15-groups/1272183002|title=Exclusive: Three-quarters of the secret money in recent elections came from 15 groups|author=Fredreka Schouten|date=September 12, 2018|website=USAToday.com|publisher=|access-date=September 13, 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 election cycle===
According to the [[Center for Responsive Politics]], dark money (which it defined as funds from outside groups that did not publicly disclose donors, plus groups that received a substantial portion of their contributions from such nondisclosing groups) accounted for nearly 44% of outside spending in the 2010 election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/disclosure.php Outside Spending by Disclosure, Excluding Party Committees], Center for Responsive Politics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 election cycle===
{{Main|United States elections, 2012}}

In the 2012 election cycle, more than $308 million in dark money was spent, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.&lt;ref name="Kertscher2016"&gt;Tom Kertscher, [http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/nov/05/tammy-baldwin/ten-times-more-dark-money-has-been-spent-2016-elec/ Ten times more 'dark money' has been spent for 2016 elections, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin says], PolitiFact (November 5, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 86 percent was spent by conservative groups, 11 percent by liberal groups and 3 percent by other groups.&lt;ref name="Kertscher2016"/&gt;

The three dark money groups which spent the largest sums were [[Karl Rove]]'s [[American Crossroads]]/[[Crossroads GPS]] ($71 million), the [[Koch brothers]]' [[Americans for Prosperity]] ($36 million) and the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] ($35 million), all conservative groups.&lt;ref name="Kertscher2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;Leah McGrath Goodman, [http://www.newsweek.com/2014/10/10/dark-money-floods-us-elections-regulators-turn-blind-eye-273951.html As Dark Money Floods U.S. Elections, Regulators Turn a Blind Eye], ''Newsweek'' (September 30, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The three liberal groups with the largest dark-money expenditures were the [[League of Conservation Voters]] ($11 million), [[Patriot Majority USA]], a group focusing on public schools and infrastructure ($7 million), and [[Planned Parenthood]] (almost $7 million).&lt;ref name="Kertscher2016"/&gt;

===2014 election cycle===
The 2014 election cycle saw the largest amount of dark money ever spent in a congressional election; the ''New York Times'' editorial board described 2014 "the greatest wave of secret, special-interest money ever."&lt;ref name="DarkMoney2014"/&gt; On the eve of the election, Republican-leaning dark money groups dominated, with $94.6 million in expenditures, exceeding dark money expenditures by Democratic-leaning dark money groups ($28.4 million), and by expenditures that could not be classified ($1.9 million).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Olsen-Phillips, [http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/10/28/dark-money-still-a-republican-game/ Dark money still a Republican game], Sunlight Foundation (October 28, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Rove's dark money group [[Crossroads GPS]] alone spent over $47 million in the 2014 election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, [https://www.brennancenter.org/blog/courts-shine-light-dark-money Courts Shine Light on Dark Money], Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law (May 26, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Senate elections, dark money spending was highly concentrated in a handful of targeted competitive states, and especially in [[United States Senate election in Alaska, 2014|Alaska]], [[United States Senate election in Arkansas, 2014|Arkansas]], [[United States Senate election in Colorado, 2014|Colorado]], [[United States Senate election in Kentucky, 2014|Kentucky]], and [[United States Senate election in North Carolina, 2014|North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="BlumenthalConcentrates"&gt;Paul Blumenthal, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/15/dark-money-2014_n_5991978.html Dark Money Concentrates In Small Number of Pivotal 2014 Races], ''Huffington Post'' (October 15, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; In the eleven most competitive Senate races, $342 million was spent by non-party outside groups, significantly more than the $89 million spent by the political parties.

In the 2014 Kentucky election, a key player was the "Kentucky Opportunity Coalition," a group supporting [[Mitch McConnell]], Republican of Kentucky,&lt;ref name="Tillis"&gt;Robert Maguire, [http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2015/11/pro-tillis-dark-money-group-funded-entirely-by-crossroads-gps/ Pro-Tillis dark money group funded entirely by Crossroads GPS], Center for Responsive Politics (November 17, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; whom the ''New York Times'' editorial board has described as "the most prominent advocate for unlimited secret campaign spending in Washington."&lt;ref name="DarkMoney2014"/&gt; The Kentucky Opportunity Coalition, a 501(c)(4) "social welfare" group,&lt;ref name="BeckelOpportunity"&gt;Michael Beckel, [http://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/11/20/18887/mysterious-pro-mitch-mcconnell-group-bankrolled-megadonors Mysterious pro-Mitch McConnell group bankrolled by megadonors: Kentucky Opportunity Coalition raised more than Kentucky Republican’s challenger], Center for Public Integrity (November 20, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; raised more than $21 million, while McConnell raised about $32 million and McConnell's opponent, Democratic candidate [[Alison Lundergan Grimes]], raised about $19 million.&lt;ref name="BeckelOpportunity"/&gt; According to a [[Center for Public Integrity]] analysis of data provided by advertising tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG, the group ran more than 12,400 television advertisements.&lt;ref name="BeckelOpportunity"/&gt; Every Kentucky Opportunity Coalition's television advertisements mentioned either McConnell or Grimes; overall, about 53 percent of the group's ads praised McConnell while the rest were [[attack ads]] against Grimes.&lt;ref name="BeckelMysteryMoney"&gt;Michael Beckel, [http://www.publicintegrity.org/2014/10/29/16088/flush-mystery-money-kentucky-nonprofit-haunts-grimes-senate-bid Flush with mystery money, Kentucky nonprofit haunts Grimes’ Senate bid: Pro-McConnell group responsible for one of every seven ads in race], Center for Public Integrity (October 29, 2014, updated May 21, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The Kentucky Opportunity Coalition relied heavily on political consultants in Washington, D.C. and Virginia linked to [[Karl Rove]]'s Crossroads groups,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Blumenthal, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/01/mitch-mcconnell-crossroads_n_4875987.html Karl Rove's Network Lurks Behind Local Kentucky Groups Backing Mitch McConnell], ''Huffington Post'' (March 1, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; and received $390,000 in a grant from Crossroads GPS.&lt;ref name="BeckelOpportunity"/&gt; Described as "mysterious," the group was listed by a [[Post Office box]],&lt;ref name="BeckelOpportunity"/&gt; and the only name formally associated with the group was political operative [[J. Scott Jennings]], a deputy political director in the [[George W. Bush administration]], a worker for McConnell's previous campaigns.&lt;ref name="BeckelMysteryMoney"/&gt; [[Melanie Sloan]] of the watchdog organization [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] said that the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition was "nothing more than a sham."&lt;ref name="BeckelOpportunity"/&gt;

Dark money also played a role in other competitive Senate seats in 2014. In ten competitive Senate seats, the winners had the following in dark-money support, according to an analysis by the [[Brennan Center for Justice]] at [[New York University School of Law]]:&lt;ref&gt;Ian Vandewalker, [http://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/outside-spending-and-dark-money-toss-senate-races-post-election-update Outside Spending and Dark Money in Toss-Up Senate Races: Post-Election Update], Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law (November 10, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In North Carolina, the pro-Tillis group "Carolina Rising" received nearly all (98.7%) of its funds from Crossroads GPS; the [[Center for Responsive Politics]] highlighted this as an example of how Crossroads GPS, a 501(c)(4) group, "evades limits on political activity through grants" to other 501(c)(4) groups.&lt;ref name="Tillis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LevineTillis"&gt;Carrie Levine, [http://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/11/17/18865/new-tax-documents-show-crossroads-gps-poured-millions-2014-senate-race New tax documents show Crossroads GPS poured millions into 2014 Senate race: Group supplied nearly all funds to North Carolina 'dark money' group], Center for Responsive Politics (November 17, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2014 cycle, Crossroads GPS also gave $5.25 million to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, $2 million to the American Future Fund, and $390,000 to the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition.&lt;ref name="LevineTillis"/&gt; In total, Crossroads GPS spent more than $13.6 million on grants to other groups, which it described as being for the purposes of "social welfare."&lt;ref name="LevineTillis"/&gt;

In 2014, the Democratic Party-aligned dark money group Patriot Majority USA, a 501(c)(4), spent almost $13.7 million on "direct and indirect political campaign activities," airing 15,000 television ads in targeted Senate races.&lt;ref name="Beckel"&gt;Michael Beckel, [http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/11/18/secret-donors-fuel-democratic-political-powerhouse.html Secret donors fuel pro-Democratic Party campaign powerhouse: Patriot Majority USA raised $30 million in 'dark money' last year], Al Jazeera (November 18, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; About half of the $30 raised by the group came from five anonymous donors.&lt;ref name="Beckel"/&gt; The group was led by Craig Varoga, "a staunch ally" of Senate Minority Leader [[Harry Reid]], Democrat of Nevada.&lt;ref name="Beckel"/&gt;

In Alaska, [[Mark Begich]] was "one of the few Democratic candidates to come close to receiving as much support from dark money as his Republican opponent."&lt;ref name="BlumenthalConcentrates"/&gt; The pro-Begich Alaska Salmon PAC, funded entirely by the League of Conservation Voters and its Alaska affiliate, spent funds in support of Begich.&lt;ref name="BlumenthalConcentrates"/&gt;

===2016 election cycle===
{{Main|United States elections, 2016}}

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, by October 2015, $4.88 million in dark money had already been spent for the 2016 election cycle, "more than 10 times the $440,000 that was spent at this point during the 2012 cycle."&lt;ref name="Kertscher2016"/&gt; The money was spent by six groups - five conservative groups (including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which spent $3 million, and Americans for Prosperity, which spent $1.5 million) and one liberal group (Planned Parenthood, which spent just under $75,000).&lt;ref name="Kertscher2016"/&gt;

According to Richard Skinner of the [[Sunlight Foundation]], "the focus of early dark money being spent in the 2016 cycle" is on competitive U.S. Senate elections and some U.S. House of Representatives races.&lt;ref name="Kertscher2016"/&gt; However, dark money also is playing a role in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 Republican presidential primaries]]; by June 2015, at least four Republican presidential candidates were raising funds via 501(c)(4) organizations: [[Bobby Jindal]]'s America Next, [[Rick Perry]]'s Americans for Economic Freedom, [[John Kasich]]'s Balanced Budget Forever, and [[Jeb Bush]]'s Right to Rise.&lt;ref name="Kuns"&gt;Karoli Kuns, [http://washingtonspectator.org/the-dark-politics-of-dark-money/ The Dark Politics of Dark Money: A defanged IRS means never having to say you’re accountable], ''Washington Spectator'' (June 19, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

501(c) "dark money" groups are distinct from [[super PACs]].&lt;ref name="ProPublica Explainer"&gt;Kim Barker &amp; Marian Wang, [https://www.propublica.org/blog/item/super-pacs-propublicas-guide-to-the-new-world-of-campaign-finance Super-PACs and Dark Money: ProPublica’s Guide to the New World of Campaign Finance], ProPublica (July 11, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; While both types of entity can raise and spend unlimited sums of money, super PACs "must disclose their donors," while 501(c) groups "must not have politics as their primary purpose but don't have to disclose who gives them money."&lt;ref name="ProPublica Explainer"/&gt;  However, a single individual or group can create both types of entity and combine their powers, making it difficult to trace the original source of funds.&lt;ref name="ProPublica Explainer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Strom, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/business/13gift.html I.R.S. Moves to Tax Gifts to Groups Active in Politics], ''New York Times'' (May 12, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; [[ProPublica]] explains: "Say some like-minded people form both a Super-PAC and a nonprofit 501(c)(4). Corporations and individuals could then donate as much as they want to the nonprofit, which isn't required to publicly disclose funders. The nonprofit could then donate as much as it wanted to the Super-PAC, which lists the nonprofit's donation but not the original contributors."&lt;ref name="ProPublica Explainer"/&gt; In at least one high-profile case, a donor to a super PAC kept his name hidden by using an [[Limited liability company|LLC]] formed for the purpose of hiding their personal name.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colbert I. King]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-dc-interests-sidestep-campaign-finance-limits/2012/01/13/gIQAzc1BxP_story.html In D.C., a mockery of campaign finance laws], ''Washington Post'' (January 14, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  One super PAC, that originally listed a $250,000 donation from an LLC that no one could find, led to a subsequent filing where the previously "secret donors" were revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Luo, [http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/07/a-secret-donor-revealed/ A secret donor revealed], ''New York Times'' (February 7, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2016 election cycle, "dark money" contributions via shell LLCs became increasingly common.&lt;ref name="Carney"&gt;Eliza Newlin Carney, [http://prospect.org/article/when-super-pacs-go-dark-llcs-fuel-secret-spending When Super PACs Go Dark: LLCs Fuel Secret Spending], ''The American Prospect'' (February 25, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Press, Center for Public Integrity, and Sunlight Foundation all "flagged dozens of donations of anywhere from $50,000 to $1 million routed through non-disclosing LLCs to super PACs" backing various presidential candidates, including [[Marco Rubio]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Ted Cruz]], [[John Kasich]], [[Jeb Bush]], and [[Carly Fiorina]].&lt;ref name="Carney"/&gt;

[[Bradley A. Smith]], a former FEC chairman who is now with the [[Center for Competitive Politics]], a group that opposes campaign-finance reform, argues that this practice is not problematic, writing that "it is possibly the making of a campaign contribution [[Straw donor|in the name of another]]," a violation of existing law.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley A. Smith, [http://www.campaignfreedom.org/2011/08/05/the-strange-case-of-w-spann-llc/ The Strange Case of W. Spann LLC], Center for Competitive Politics (August 5, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kathy Kiely, managing editor of the Sunlight Foundation, "untraceable dark money is a preferred tactic of conservatives, while Democrats tend to use traceable super PACs."&lt;ref&gt;Katie Sanders, [http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/06/joe-scarborough/which-side-spent-more-2014-midterms-democrats-or-r/ Which side spent more on the 2014 midterms, Democrats or Republicans?], PolitiFact (November 6, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disclosure in U.S. elections==
The first federal law requiring disclosure of campaign contributions, the [[Federal Corrupt Practices Act]], was passed in 1910. By the late 1970s, virtually all states and the federal government required public disclosure of campaign contributions and information on political donors. Most states and the federal government also required public disclosure of information about donors and amounts spent on independent expenditures, that is, expenditures made independently of a candidate's campaign.

In January 2010, at least 38 states and the federal government required [[election law|disclosure]] for all or some independent expenditures or [[Political campaign|electioneering]] communications, for all sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&amp;context=ylsspps_papers Citizens Informed: Broader Disclosure and Disclaimer for Corporate Electoral Advocacy in the Wake of Citizens United, Yale Law School Legal Scholarship Repository, Page 625 footnote 13, by Daniel Winik Yale Law School, January 1, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to PACs, non-profit groups ranging from Planned Parenthood to Crossroads may make expenditures in connection with political races. Since these non-profits are not political committees, as defined in the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]], they have few reporting requirements beyond the amounts of their expenditures. They are not required by law to publicly disclose information on their donors. As a result, voters do not know who gave money to these groups.  Reports have disclosed instances where non-profits were managed by close associates, former staff, or a candidate's family member, and this has led to concern that the candidates benefiting from their expenditures would be able to know who donated the funds to the non-profit group, but the public would not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indystar.com/article/20120206/NEWS05/202060313/Indiana-businesses-giving-big-money-presidential-super-PACs?nclick_check=1 Indiana businesses giving big money to presidential super PACs, Indianapolis Star 2012-02-06]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the 2012 election cycle, one organization, the [[National Organization for Marriage]], or NOM, operated two non-profit arms that received millions in donations from just a few donors.  It in turn funded several different [[political action committee|PACs]]. While these PACs had to disclose that NOM contributed the funds, they were not required to disclose who gave money to NOM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bangordailynews.com/2011/03/02/politics/national-organization-for-marriage-appeals-ruling-requiring-release-of-donor-list/ National Organization for Marriage appeals ruling requiring release of donor list, The Associated Press, March 02, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative and regulatory proposals and debate over dark money==
Democrats in the [[United States Congress]] have repeatedly introduced the [[DISCLOSE Act]], proposed legislation to require disclosure of election spending by "corporations, labor unions, super-PACs, and, most importantly, politically active nonprofits."&lt;ref name="Kroll"&gt;Andy Kroll, [https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/06/senate-disclose-act-dark-money-mitch-mcconnell Senate Democrats Re-up Their Dark-Money Disclosure Bill—and Dare GOPers to Block It], ''Mother Jones'' (June 24, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 version of the DISCLOSE Act would require covered groups, including 501(c)(4), to reveal the source of election-spending donations of $10,000 or more.&lt;ref name="Kroll"/&gt; The bill also targets the use of pass-through and [[shell corporation]]s to evade disclosure by requiring that such groups disclose the origin of contributions.&lt;ref name="Kroll"/&gt; Senate Republicans, led by their leader [[Mitch McConnell]], "have blocked earlier iterations of the DISCLOSE Act since 2010."&lt;ref name="Kroll"/&gt;

According to [[Columbia Law School]]'s Richard Briffault, disclosure of campaign expenditures, contributions, and donors is intended to deter corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/elj.2010.9408 Campaign finance disclosure 2.0, ''Election Law Journal'', by Richard Briffault, page 14 of 31, November 4, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Elections Commission]], which regulates federal elections, has been unable to control dark money. According to the Center for Public Integrity, FEC commissioners are voting on many fewer enforcement matters than in the past because of "an overtaxed staff and commissioner disagreement."&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; The IRS (rather than the FEC) is responsible for oversight of 501(c)(4) groups.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; The IRS "found itself ill-prepared for the groundswell" of such groups taking and spending unlimited amounts of money for political purposes in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'' in 2010.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; The agency particularly "struggled to identify which organizations appeared to be spending more than the recommended 50 percent of their annual budgets on political activities—and even to define what 'political spending' was."&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; When the IRS began looking at nonprofit spending, it was [[IRS targeting controversy|accused of improper targeting]] in a 2013 controversy.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;

"With the FEC and IRS duly sidelined" advocates for disclosure turned to the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC); nine academics from universities across the U.S. filed petitioned the SEC in August 2011 for the agency to "develop rules to require public companies to disclose to [[shareholder]]s the use of corporate resources for political activities."&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; The petition received over a million comments in the following month, "a record amount for the SEC, with the overwhelming majority of voters asking for better disclosure."&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; According to [[Lucian Bebchuk]], a Harvard professor of law, economics, and finance who helped draft the petition, the request had drawn the support of "nearly a dozen senators and more than 40 members of the House."&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; Under current SEC regulations, [[public company|public corporations]] must file a [[Form 8-K]] report to publicly announce major events of interest to shareholders.&lt;ref name="Sunlight"&gt;John Wonderlich, [https://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/documents/comprehensive-disclosure-regime-wake-supreme-court/ A Comprehensive Disclosure Regime in the Wake of the Supreme Court's Decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission], Sunlight Foundation (accessed September 20, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sunlight Foundation]], a group which advocates for a comprehensive disclosure regime, has proposed that the 8-K rule should be updated to require that aggregate spending of $10,000 on political activities (such as monetary contributions, in-kind contributions, and membership dues or other payments to organizations that engage in political activities) should be disclosed and made publicly available via the 8-K system.&lt;ref name="Sunlight"/&gt;

In 2015, Republicans in Congress successfully pushed for a [[Rider (legislation)|rider]] in a 2015 [[omnibus spending bill]] that bars the IRS from clarifying the social-welfare tax exemption to combat dark money "from advocacy groups that claim to be social welfare organizations rather than political committees."&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"&gt;Katy O'Donnell, [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/white-house-dark-money-216956 White House surrenders on 'dark money' regulation], ''Politico'' (December 18, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Other provisions in the 2015 bill bar the SEC from requiring corporations to disclose campaign spending to shareholders, and a ban application of the gift tax to nonprofit donors. The Obama administration opposed these provisions, but President Obama eventually acceded to them in December 2015, with the White House declining to comment. The nonpartisan [[Campaign Legal Center]] said in a statement that the dark-money provision ensures "that the door to secret foreign dollars in U.S. elections remains wide open through secret contributions to these ostensibly 'nonpolitical' groups that run campaign ads without any disclosure of their donors."&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"/&gt;

The [[Center for Competitive Politics]] (CCP), chaired by former FEC chairman [[Bradley A. Smith]], opposes legislation to require the disclosure of dark-money groups, saying: "Our view is that many people will be driven out of politics if they are forced to disclose their names and their personal information. The purpose of disclosure is to help people monitor the government, not for the government to monitor the people."&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; The Center for Competitive Politics views "dark money" as a pejorative term, stating that the phrase "evokes an emotional, fearful reaction" and contending that "many of the statistics published on the topic aim to mislead rather than enlighten."&lt;ref name="Nese"&gt;Matt Nese, [http://www.campaignfreedom.org/2015/07/08/five-misconceptions-about-dark-money/ Five Misconceptions About "Dark Money"], Center for Competitive Politics (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The CCP maintains that dark money "comprises a very small percentage of total campaign spending," calculating the percent of money spent in federal elections by organizations that did not provide itemized disclosure of their donors as 4.3% in 2012 and 3.7% in 2014.&lt;ref name="Nese"/&gt;

'''Disodium 5'-ribonucleotides''', [[E number]] E635, is a [[Flavor|flavor enhancer]] which is synergistic with [[glutamate]]s in creating the taste of [[umami]]. It is a mixture of [[disodium inosinate]] (IMP) and [[disodium guanylate]] (GMP) and is often used where a food already contains natural glutamates (as in [[meat extract]]) or added [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG).  It is primarily used in flavored noodles, snack foods, chips, crackers, sauces and fast foods. It is produced by combining the [[sodium]] salts of the natural [[chemical compound|compounds]] [[guanylic acid]] (E626) and [[inosinic acid]] (E630).

A mixture composing of 98% monosodium glutamate and 2% E635 has four times the flavor enhancing power of monosodium glutamate (MSG) alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemicalland21.com/lifescience/foco/5%27-RIBONUCLEOTIDES.htm 5'-Ribonucleotides] at chemicalland21.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side effects and safety==
Disodium 5'-ribonucleotides were first assessed in 1974 by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives based on all available scientific literature. This assessment resulted in a new specification prepared and an "ADI Not Specified".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/jecfa-reports/en/] JECFA Reports WHO Technical Report Series (TRS)&lt;/ref&gt; This essentially means that this additive shows no toxicology at any level and acceptable daily limits do not need to be set. The definition is as follows:

{{blockquote|This statement means that, on the basis of available data (chemical, biochemical, and toxicological), the total daily intake of the substance arising from its use or uses at levels necessary to achieve the desired effect and from its acceptable background in food, does not, in the opinion of the Committee, represent a hazard to health. For this reason, and for reasons stated in the individual evaluations, the establishment of an acceptable daily intake (ADI) expressed in mg per kg of body weight is not deemed necessary.}}

In 1993 the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives considered several more studies on this food additive and retained the "ADI not specified" safety classification.

==Career and positions==
Araújo is a career diplomat at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (often called Itamaraty after its headquarters). He is also a writer of three fiction novels.&lt;ref name=UOL&gt;[https://noticias.uol.com.br/internacional/ultimas-noticias/2018/11/14/quem-e-ernesto-araujo-itamaraty-novo-indicado.htm Bolsonaro foge de nomes 'óbvios' e escolhe diplomata pró-Trump: Ernesto Araújo, UOL, accessed 14 November 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; He served in Itamaraty's division of [[Mercosur]] affairs from 1991 to 1995, and from 2007 to July 2010 was a deputy chief at the Brazilian Embassy in [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref name=BC /&gt; An anonymous colleague of Araújo at Itamaraty described him as an "extremely scholarly man", with profound knowledge of ancient history.&lt;ref name=UOL /&gt;

In a 2017 article published by the International Relations Research Institute (IPRI), Araújo praises U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] for his nationalist rhetoric and holds that he is restoring Western values that have been challenged by [[nihilism]], which he believes is the Western enemy that replaced [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://funag.gov.br/loja/download/CADERNOS-DO-IPRI-N-6.pdf Cadernos do IPRI no 6, pages 323-359]&lt;/ref&gt; Araújo also maintains a blog entitled "Metapolitics 17 – Against Globalism", where he writes that [[globalism]] "is the economic globalization that has been driven by [[cultural Marxism]]" and that is "essentially anti-human and anti-Christian".&lt;ref&gt;[https://exame.abril.com.br/brasil/diplomata-ernesto-araujo-e-anunciado-ministro-de-relacoes-exteriores/ Bolsonaro anuncia diplomata Ernesto Araújo para Relações Exteriores, Istoé, accessed 14 November 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; On his blog, Araújo has also claimed that climate change is a "cultural Marxism" plot to undermine Western countries in order to support China's growth, and has also lamented the "criminalisation" of red meat, oil and [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] [[Sexual intercourse|sex]].'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/15/brazil-foreign-minister-ernesto-araujo-climate-change-marxist-plot|title=Brazil's new foreign minister believes climate change is a Marxist plot|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=2018-11-15|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a November 2018 press conference, when asked about how he will approach foreign nations as foreign minister, Araújo said there will be no preference towards any nation and that Brazil will have "excellent relations with all partners to improve partnerships for the benefit of all and, above all, the Brazilian people".&lt;ref name=G1 /&gt;

'''''Floor 13''''' is a [[strategy video game]] published by [[Virgin Interactive|Virgin Games]] in 1991. The game set in the [[United Kingdom]], where the player is the director of a secret governmental agency involved in clandestine domestic operations; the headquarters is hidden on the [[thirteenth floor]] of [[Canary Wharf|a bank building]] in [[London Docklands]], hence the title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amr.abime.net/review_51298 "Floor 13"]. ''Games-X 33'' (Dec 1991) -  via Amiga Magazine Rack&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The player takes on the role of the [[Director-general|Director General]] of the "Department of Agriculture and Fisheries", a non-existent [[Executive Agency]] that conceals a [[secret police]] which keeps the government popular by any means necessary. Answering only to the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], the Director General has the power to use [[telephone tapping|wiretapping]], [[surveillance]], [[smear campaign|smear tactics]], [[disinformation]], [[burglary]], [[kidnapping]], [[torture]], and [[assassination]] to keep the government popular with the people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amr.abime.net/review_7553 "Floor 13"]. ''AUI'' Vol 6 No 11 (Nov 1992) - via Amiga Magazine Rack.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Director General's regular duties suppressing and removing those who threaten the [[status quo]], there is also a [[subplot]] involving his membership in a [[secret society]] called "The Secret Masters of [[Thoth]]". These missions, which are received from a "Secret Master" wearing the vestments of an [[Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]], involve more bizarre opposition than regular missions; these missions include protecting a fellow member from a [[Mafia]] assassination, foiling an attempt to subvert the nation by [[The Body Snatchers|pod people]] in key positions, the protection of the [[Church of the SubGenius]] from a scandal, and restraining the growing power of the [[Illuminati]], among others.

The game contains numerous references to real-world groups, trends, scandals, and unusual occurrences that were newsworthy in the 1980s and early 1990s, including the [[The Troubles|Irish Troubles]], [[Shining Path]], the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI scandal]], and the apparent suicides of [[Roberto Calvi]] and [[Jonathan Moyle]].

== Gameplay ==
The game is [[Menu (computing)|menu-driven]] and presents the player with scenarios through reports viewable in the Director General's office each day. Each scenario represents a potential scandal that may hurt the Government's popularity if not properly handled by the player. The player interacts with the game by issuing orders to eight different departments which represent the capabilities available to the Director General (such as surveillance, assassination, interrogation, or disinformation) to use those capabilities against individuals, locations, or groups involved in each scenario. Once each day's reports are read and any orders have been issued, the player can advance to the next day to see the results of their orders and the progress of scenarios. Each scenario is scripted and will generally always proceed in the same way absent the player's intervention (with minor details such as names and pictures of individuals changed), but some of the results of the player's orders are randomized (for example, assassination attempts may fail or interrogation of individuals may or may not reveal particular information). Each individual or group is rated in the reports as to prominence, power, and orientation towards the government, attributes that will affect the likelihood of success of attempted actions taken against them and the likely results on public opinion. Some scenarios have multiple possible resolutions depending on what means the player chooses to use, and may also generate positive press, raising the Government’s popularity, if handled well.

During the course of the game, the player must walk a [[metaphor]]ical [[tightrope walking|tightrope]], with two possible ways to lose the game. Every 21 days, the Prime Minister reviews the [[opinion poll]]s and will fire the Director General, hereinafter known as DG, if the Government’s approval rating is under 50%. If the player is [[irrationality|too severe]] in using aggressive means that attract unwelcome public attention, firing will be implemented by "Mr. Garcia," an assassin sent by the Prime Minister, giving the DG "[[defenestration|flying lessons]]" out of the DG’s office window. If the Government still has the lead in the polls every 21 days, the DG will be given more money and employees to work with. With luck, the DG can temporarily keep his job by spying on and ignoring or discrediting suspects without using more severe and obvious methods such as "[[targeted killing|removal]]", "[[enhanced interrogation|interrogation]]" or "heavy assault"; however, if the player is clumsy or blatant, the Prime Minister will increasingly threaten and then order a flying lesson to be given to the DG. The last Director General (jokingly named after [[Richard Branson]], the owner of the Virgin Group) suffered from a severe case of [[defenestration]] at the hands of Mr. Garcia, and the same will happen to the new DG if he gets too far out of line.

If the DG somehow manages to avoid being [[antanaclasis|fired, out of a window or otherwise]], then the game has two possible successful endings. if the player has successfully navigated through every scandal encountered for an entire year while keeping the approval rating above 50%, the Government realizes that the player knows too much and appoints him or her Prime Minister; with a final note to "enjoy it while it lasts". The other ending involves successfully completing all seven Secret Master missions; the player is anointed the new head of the Secret Masters of Thoth and the face of the character is shown. The final note of this ending: "Was it worth it?"

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s [[Charles Ardai]] called ''Floor 13'' "the most unpleasant espionage game ever made", comparing it to a [[James Bond]] fan's reaction to ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' ("It is simply handled poorly"). Beyond disliking the [[KGB]] or [[Gestapo]]-like "loathsome secret police activity" the game depicted, he wrote of the gameplay that "[[Hannah Arendt]] could not have conceived of more banal evil. ''Floor 13'' turns acts of unmitigated cruelty into bloodless, arm's length bureaucratic functions ... a type and quality of gameplay that was obsolete in 1978".&lt;ref name="ardai199212"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&amp;pub=2&amp;id=101 | title=Virgin Games' Floor 13 | work=Computer Gaming World | date=December 1992 | accessdate=5 July 2014 | author=Ardai, Charles | pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foot voting''' is expressing one's preferences through one's actions, by voluntarily participating in or withdrawing from an activity, group, or process; especially, physical migration to leave a situation one does not like, or to move to a situation one regards as more beneficial. People who engage in foot voting are said to "'''vote with their feet'''".

Legal scholar [[Ilya Somin]] has described foot voting as "a tool for enhancing political freedom: the ability of the people to choose the political regime under which they wish to live".{{r|Somin-2014}} Communist leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] commented, "They voted with their feet," regarding Russian soldiers deserting the army of the [[Tsar]].{{r|Wintringham-1935}} The concept has also been associated with [[Charles Tiebout]], who pioneered the concept (although he did not use the ''term'' "foot voting") in a 1956 paper,{{r|Tiebout-1956}}{{r|Somin-2011|p=203}} and with [[Ronald Reagan]], who advocated migration between states of the USA as a solution to unsatisfactory local conditions.{{r|Reagan-1981-11-19}}{{r|McGrory-1982-01-21}}

== Law and politics ==

Legal scholar [[Ilya Somin]] has argued that foot voting requires far less information (on the part of the citizens engaging in it) to be exercised effectively than does literal voting at the ballot box; that foot voters are more strongly motivated to acquire relevant information than are ballot-box voters; and that decentralized federalism promotes the welfare of citizens because it facilitates foot voting.{{r|Somin-2014}}{{r|Somin-2011}} Somin has also used foot voting to make a case for changes in [[international law]] to allow easier [[Human migration|migration]] across international [[Border|borders]].{{r|Somin-2014}} Legal scholars Roderick M. Hills, Jr., and Shitong Qiao have used China as a case study to argue that foot voting is ineffective unless meaningful ballot-box voting is also in place.{{r|Hills-and-Qiao-2017}} Somin has rebutted this critique.{{r|Somin-2017-01-08}}

== Culture ==

Models from theoretical biology have been applied to elucidate the causal relationships between foot voting and the dissemination of human cultural characteristics.{{r|Boyd-and-Richerson-2009}}

Hong Kong's '''''Goddess of Democracy''''' is a 6.4-metre [[faux bronze]] statue sculpted by [[Chen Weiming (sculptor)|Chen Weiming]], inspired by the original 10-metre tall ''[[Goddess of Democracy]]''. The original foam and papier-mâché statue was erected by the Chinese [[Tiananmen protests of 1989|pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square]] at the end of May 1989, and destroyed by [[People's Liberation Army at Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|soldiers clearing the protesters from Tiananmen square]] on June 4, 1989.

Three successive political controversies surrounded the statue in 2010 in the backdrop to the [[21st anniversary of Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|twenty-first anniversary of the suppression of the Tiananmen pro-democracy movement]]. Firstly, it was seized by the Hong Kong police at a street rally at the public open space in [[Times Square (Hong Kong)|Times Square, Causeway Bay]] on the grounds that the display violated safety regulations, which was, according to the protesters, a trumped up charge.&lt;ref name=students&gt;"Students plan to move democracy statues to campus", Associated Press and Staff Reporter, (3 June 2010). ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the sculptor was denied entry into Hong Kong on 2 June, when he journeyed to Hong Kong to examine the sculpture for possible damage whilst in police custody. Thirdly, the erection of the statue on the campus of the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (CUHK) was denied by university authorities, to the ire of the student leadership. The various controversies surrounding the statue reportedly increased the number of people attending the annual 4 June vigil in Hong Kong to historical highs.

Since the record turnout for the anniversary vigil, and under pressure from students, the Chinese University administration acquiesced in allowing the statue a 'temporary home' near the Chinese University exit of the [[University Station (MTR)|MTR University Station]].

==Background==
The original ''Goddess of Democracy'' statue has become an icon of [[liberty]] and a symbol of the [[free speech]] and [[World Movement for Democracy|democracy movements]].&lt;ref name="DC" /&gt; The Chinese government has tried to distance itself from any discussions about the original statue or about the Tiananmen Square protests, and in the case of the [[Victims of Communism Memorial]] it called the building of a replica an "attempt to defame China."&lt;ref name="DC"&gt;{{cite news|title=New DC memorial dedicated to communism's victims|work=Chicago Tribune|author=Falk, Leora|date=12 June 2007|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-070612monuments,1,2433167.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several replicas of the statue have been erected worldwide to commemorate the events of 1989.

As no discussion about or mention of the 1989 protests is tolerated in [[mainland China]], and because China has publicly embraced the [[one country, two systems]] model of governance for Hong Kong, the annual 4 June observance – a tradition since 1989 – has continued after the [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China]].&lt;ref name=taipei&gt;Associated Press (3 June 2010).

The statue was sculpted of an imitated copper material, has been exhibited in the front of the [[United States Congress]] in the American capital after its completion in 2008.&lt;ref name=artnext&gt;[http://www.artnextgallery.com/98.html Chen Weiming], ArtNext Gallery&lt;/ref&gt; Another work of the sculptor, a relief measuring 6.4&amp;nbsp;m wide by 3.2&amp;nbsp;m high entitled ''Tiananmen Massacre'' completed in June 2009,&lt;ref name=artnext/&gt; joined the statue in Hong Kong in 2010.&lt;ref name=secret&gt;Staff reporters (3 June 2010).

The seizures were controversial. Although the management of Times Square said it preferred activities without political elements, it had not complained before police intervened. The police force said it was not responsible for enforcing the public entertainment law, so it had no statistics concerning it; the [[Food and Environmental Hygiene Department]] said only seven prosecutions had been made under the law since the beginning of last year.&lt;ref name=back_down/&gt; A government spokesman said that the art pieces would be returned "under condition that the police's relevant requirements will be followed." The Leisure and Cultural Services Department stipulated insurance and approval from registered engineers to guarantee that any object taller than 1.7 metres used on 4 June met safety standards.&lt;ref name=conditions&gt;(1 Jun 2010) [http://www.asianews.it/news-en/About-us-127.html "Hong Kong police sets conditions for returning the Goddess of Democracy"], AsiaNews.it&lt;/ref&gt; Activists refused the pre-conditions, and Alliance Deputy chairman [[Lee Cheuk-yan]] threatened that North Point police station, where the pieces were being held, would be surrounded at 6&amp;nbsp;pm on 3 June by citizens demanding their release.&lt;ref name=conditions/&gt; After the statues and activists were hauled away, the Alliance displayed a 4.5-metre painting of the Goddess of Democracy in Times Square; several activists dressed like the statue.&lt;ref name=conditions/&gt;

''[[Apple Daily]]'' reported that similar observances with props were held at Times Square the previous year, and passed without police harassment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JY3kKR_vx8 Apple Daily newsclip of the police confiscation] {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police said that they had acted on a request from the Environment Department on 29 May; the [[Home Affairs Bureau]] said it was not notified ahead of the action. After several hours of negotiations with leaders of the Alliance, Police released the statues on 1 June notwithstanding activists' refusal to undertake not to display the statues within the vicinity of Times Square again.&lt;ref name=released&gt;Leung, Ambrose &amp; Tsang, Phyllis (2 June 2010).

Civil rights groups and Pan-democrats reacted angrily to the seizure, warning that [[freedom of expression]] was under threat;&lt;ref name=anger&gt;Fung, Fanny &amp; Cheung, Gary (5 June 2010). "Huge turnout surprises vigil organisers", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese Human Rights Defenders called the government actions "an unprecedented act of interference with the territory's commemorative activities."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/tiananmen-memorials-06032010093651.html Police Quash Tiananmen Memorials] (3 June 2010), Radio Free Asia&lt;/ref&gt; Public anger over the seizures, and fears of political repression, were widely cited as a direct cause for the record 150,000 participants (or 113,000 according to the police) to attend 4 June vigil.&lt;ref name=torch&gt;Tsang, Phyllis (6 June 2010).

The meeting was chaired by incumbent vice-chancellor [[Lawrence Lau]].

The staff union said: "As an institution of higher learning dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and truth, the Chinese University should maintain so-called ‘neutrality’ by facing historical facts bravely". Student union president Eric Lai also accused the administration of hypocrisy, citing that university president Lawrence Lau lacked neutrality because he served on advisory bodies for the Hong Kong and central governments.&lt;ref name=students/&gt;

Vice-chancellor designate [[Joseph Sung]], who was out of town, but was consulted on the vote, admitted that it was the biggest political storm in 21 years. He said he was opposed to invoking political neutrality as the reason for refusal, and that others shared that view.

The term '''golf property''' is used to describe a [[Niche real estate|niche]] in the property market: residential real estate linked to a [[golf course]]. Golf property can be in the ownership of the golf course or in proximity to the golf course. The idea of combining the design of a golf course with a subdivision housing property originated in the USA and is now found in many parts of the world.

In the United States, there are over 2,000 golf courses with surrounding residential properties.  Homes, townhouses, and condos make up the majority of golf properties in the US.  In recent years, the concept has gone global with golf communities stretching from Dubai to Australia.  Legendary golfers such as Jack Nicklaus, [[Arnold Palmer]], and Greg Norman have played a key role in the increased rate of development through partnership with national and global home builders including [[Lennar]], [[Toll Brothers]], and others.

Located on one site in south east [[Perth, Scotland]], '''HM Prison Perth''' is a [[prison]] that houses short term adult male prisoners (those prisoners serving under 4 years). A maximum security establishment which also houses fine defaulters and those on [[Detention of suspects|remand]] from the courts of [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]], [[City of Dundee]], [[Perth and Kinross]] and the northern part of [[Fife]]. There is also a secure unit for [[Prison security categories in the United Kingdom|Category A prisoners]] who are serving sentences of up to life imprisonment. The prison has a national unit that houses disruptive prisoners, where intensive staff/prisoner interaction occurs.

The main building, a half-mile (1&amp;nbsp;km) south of the city centre beyond the South Inch, was constructed by architect [[Robert Reid (architect)|Robert Reid]] (1774–1856) from 1810-12 to hold French prisoners captured during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In 1842, the building began service as a civilian prison and today represents Scotland's oldest prison still in use. It comprises five halls (labelled A to C) and has a capacity of 504 prisoners.

A second building, Friarton Hall, which was until 1999 a separate institution known as HM Prison Friarton, lies opposite the southern end of [[Moncrieffe Island]], {{convert|1+1/4|mi|km}} south southeast of the town centre. This modern building once served to prepare prisoners for open conditions and had a capacity of 89. Friarton closed in early 2010 and is no longer part of HMP Perth, this building was demolished to make way for a new housing estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst7977.html| title=HM Prison Perth| publisher=[[Gazetteer for Scotland]]| accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HMP Perth no longer has a D Hall or an E hall. The old C Hall was knocked down in 2006 to make way for a new fit for purpose C Hall which holds 365 prisoners. Jail now holds 700. Perth holds a lot of long term prisoners (4 years or more).

A total of three [[judicial execution]]s by [[hanging]] took place on the [[gallows]] at Perth prison during the 20th Century:

* Edward Johnstone - executed 19 August 1908 for the murder of Jane Wallace (Withers)
* Alexander Edmundstone - executed 16 July 1909 for the murder of Michael Swinton Brown
* Stanislaw Miszka - executed 6 February 1948 for the murder of Catherine McIntyre

As was customary, the bodies of executed prisoners were buried in [[unmarked grave]]s within the prison walls.

Under the [[EU Common Agricultural Policy]], subsidies known as '''headage payments''' are paid to producers based on the number of head of a specific type of [[livestock]]. Such [[payment]]s may be contingent upon participation in a supply control program (e.g., limiting the number of livestock on a [[farm]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3590">The '''House-Grey Memorandum''' was a memorandum prepared by [[President of the United States]] [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s diplomatic emissary to Europe, "Colonel" [[Edward M. House]], and the British Foreign Secretary, Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]].

The memorandum, drafted in memo form by Grey, was an invitation from the U.S. to all those involved in the [[First World War]] to participation in a U.S.-sponsored peace convention. President Wilson aimed to have a role at the peace conference in order to curb {{vague|date=August 2016}} the big European powers' ambitions.  If Germany declined to attend, the U.S. would probably become militarily involved in the European conflict.

Wilson "approved the whole of the agreement",&lt;ref&gt;Neu, Charles S. ''Colonel House: A Biography of Woodrow Wilson's Silent Partner'' Oxford University Press (2015) p239&lt;/ref&gt; but added the word 'probably'. Grey showed the Memorandum to the French Ambassador [[Paul Cambon]]. Cambon believed that the Memorandum was just an election tactic for Wilson&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur S. Link|Link, Arthur S.]] ''Wilson, Volume IV: Confusions and Crises, 1915-1916'' Princeton University Press (1964) note on p139&lt;/ref&gt; who would be standing  again for [[United States presidential election, 1916|President that year]].

The British Government, led by Prime Minister [[H.H. Asquith]], vetoed the proposal as neither they, nor their French ally, wanted a return to the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'' but a victory over the [[German Empire]].

== Text ==

Confidential
22 February 1916.

Colonel House told me that President Wilson was ready, on hearing from France and England that the moment was opportune, to propose that a Conference should be summoned to put an end to the war.

Should the Allies accept this proposal, and should Germany refuse it, the United States would probably enter the war against Germany.

Colonel House expressed the opinion that, if such a Conference met, it would secure peace on terms not unfavourable to the Allies; and, if it failed to secure peace, the United States would leave the Conference as a belligerent on the side of the Allies, if Germany was unreasonable.

Colonel House expressed an opinion decidedly favourable to the restoration of Belgium, the transfer of Alsace and Lorraine to France, and the acquisition by Russia of an outlet to the sea, though he thought that the loss of territory incurred by Germany in one place would have to be compensated to her by concessions to her in other places outside Europe.

If the Allies delayed accepting the offer of President Wilson, and if, later on, the course of the war was so unfavourable to them that the intervention of the United States would not be effective, the United States would probably disinterest themselves in Europe and look to their own protection in their own way.

I said that I felt the statement, coming from the President of the United States, to be a matter of such importance that I must inform the Prime Minister and my colleagues; but that I could say nothing until it had received their consideration.

The British Government could, under no circumstances accept or make any proposal except in consultation and agreement with the Allies...

'''[[Italy|Italian]] [[Contemporary art]]''' refers to painting and sculpture in Italy from the early 20th century onwards.

==Futurism==
{{Main|Futurism}}
The founder and most influential personality of Futurism was the Italian writer [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], who launched the movement in his ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'' in 1909.

The Futurists expressed a loathing of everything old, especially political and artistic tradition. They admired [[speed]], [[technology]], youth and [[violence]], the car, the airplane and the industrial city, all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over [[nature]], and they were passionate nationalists. 
The Futurists practised in every medium of art, including [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]], [[interior design]], [[theatre]], [[film]], [[fashion]], [[textiles]], [[literature]], music, [[architecture]] and even [[Futurist meals|gastronomy]].

The leading painters of the movement were [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Giacomo Balla]] and [[Gino Severini]]. They advocated a "universal dynamism," which was to be directly represented in painting. At first they used the techniques of [[Divisionism]], breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes,  later adopting the methods of [[Cubism]].  In 1912, Boccioni turned to sculpture to translate into three dimensions his Futurist ideas.

Advocates of war as "the world's best hygiene," Marinetti, Boccioni, and Sant'Elia all volunteered to fight during World War One. The unofficial end of the first wave of Futurism (also known as the Heroic Years) was in 1916 - the same year Boccioni died in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/press-room/releases/5708-guggenheim-museum-presents-unprecedented-survey-of-italian-futurism-opening-in-february |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429052622/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/press-room/releases/5708-guggenheim-museum-presents-unprecedented-survey-of-italian-futurism-opening-in-february |archivedate=2015-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the War, Marinetti revived the movement, seeking to make Futurism the official state art of [[Fascism|Fascist]] Italy.  The main expression of Futurism in painting in the 1930s and early 1940s was Aeropainting (''[[aeropittura]]''), launched in a manifesto of 1929, ''Perspectives of Flight'', signed by [[Benedetta Cappa]], [[Fortunato Depero]], [[Gerardo Dottori]], [[Fillìa]], Marinetti, [[Enrico Prampolini]], Somenzi and Tato. The technology and excitement of flight, directly experienced by most aeropainters,&lt;ref name=Osborn&gt;[http://simultaneita.net/tulliocrali.html Osborn, Bob, ''Tullio Crali: the Ultimate Futurist Aeropainter''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207090815/http://www.simultaneita.net/tulliocrali.html |date=2010-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; offered aeroplanes and [[aerial landscape art|aerial landscape]] as new subject matter. 
 
Futurism had depended so much on its energetic promotion by Marinetti that his death in 1944 brought the movement to an end.  Its association with Italian Fascism meant that most of its artists were shunned in the post-war years, but it has received scholarly attention in recent decades and a major exhibition was launched to coincide with the centenary in 2009. In 2014, the Solomon R. Guggenheim held a major Futurist retrospective featuring over 300 Futurist pieces spanning all media they worked in.

==Novecento Italiano==
{{Main|Novecento Italiano}}
[[Novecento Italiano]] was an Italian artistic movement founded in [[Milan]] in 1922 by [[Anselmo Bucci]] (1887–1955), [[Leonardo Dudreville]], [[Achille Funi]], [[Gian Emilio Malerba]], [[Piero Marussig]], [[Ubaldo Oppi]] and [[Mario Sironi]].  Motivated by a post-war “[[Return to order|call to order]]”, they were brought together by Lino Pesaro, a gallery owner interested in modern art, and [[Margherita Sarfatti]], a writer and art critic who worked on Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini|Benito Mussolini’s]] newspaper, ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]''.  Sarfatti was also Mussolini’s mistress.

The movement was officially launched in 1923 at an exhibition in Milan, with Mussolini as one of the speakers.  After being represented at the [[Venice Biennale]] of 1924, the group split and was reformed.  The new Novecento Italiano staged its first group exhibition in Milan in 1926.

Several of the artists were [[First World War|war]] veterans; Sarfatti had lost a son in the war.  The group wished to take on the Italian establishment and create an art associated with the rhetoric of [[Fascism]].  The artists supported the Fascist regime and their work became associated with the state propaganda department, although Mussolini reprimanded Sarfatti for using his name and the name of Fascism to promote Novecento.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=735492 Saviona Mane, "The Jewish mother of Fascism", ''Haaretz'', 6 July 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The name of the movement (which means 1900s) was a deliberate reference to Italian art in the 15th and 16th centuries.  The group rejected European avant garde art and wished to revive the tradition of large format history painting in the [[Classicism|classical]] manner.  It lacked a precise artistic programme and included artists of different styles and temperament, for example, [[Carlo Carrà|Carrà]] and [[Marino Marini (sculptor)|Marini]].  It aimed to promote a renewed yet traditional Italian art.  Sironi said, “if we look at the painters of the second half of the 19th century, we find that only the revolutionary were great and that the greatest were the most revolutionary”; the artists of Novecento Italiano “would not imitate the world created by God but would be inspired by it”.

==Metaphysical art==

{{Main|Metaphysical art}}
Metaphysical art ({{lang-it|Pittura metafisica}}) is the name of an Italian [[art movement]], created by [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and [[Carlo Carrà]]. Their dream-like paintings of squares typical of idealized Italian cities, as well as apparently casual [[Juxtaposition (literary)|juxtaposition]]s of objects, represented a visionary world which engaged most immediately with the [[unconscious mind]], beyond physical reality, hence the name. The metaphysical movement provided significant impetus for the development of [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]].

==Classical modernism of the 20th century==
At the beginning of the 20th century, Italian sculptors and painters joined the rest of Western Europe in the revitalization of a simpler, more vigorous, less sentimental Classical tradition, that was applied in liturgical as well as decorative and political settings.  The leading sculptors included: Libero Andreotti, [[Arturo Martini]], [[Giacomo Manzù]], Nicola Neonato, Pietro Guida, Marcello Mascherini.

==Arte povera==
{{Main|Arte povera}}
The term [[Arte Povera]] was introduced in [[Italy]] during the period of upheaval at the end of the 1960s, when artists were taking a [[Political radicalism|radical]] stance. Artists began attacking the values of established institutions of government, industry, and culture, and even questioning whether art as the private expression of the individual still had an ethical reason to exist. Italian art critic [[Germano Celant]] organized two exhibitions in 1967 and 1968, followed by an influential book called ''Arte Povera'', promoting the notion of a revolutionary art, free of convention, the power of structure, and the market place. Although Celant attempted to encompass the radical elements of the entire international scene, the term properly centered on a group of Italian artists who attacked the corporate mentality with an art of unconventional materials and style.

The most wide-ranging public collection of works from the Arte Povera movement is at the [[Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein]].

==Transavantgarde==
[[Transavantgarde]] is the Italian version of [[Neo-expressionism]], an art movement that swept through Italy, and the rest of Western Europe, in the late 1970s and 1980s.  The term ''transavantgarde'' was coined by the Italian art critic, [[Achille Bonito Oliva]], and literally means ''beyond the [[avant-garde]]''.  This art movement rejected [[conceptual art]], reintroducing emotion―especially joy―back into painting and sculpture.  The artists revived [[figurative art]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].  The principal transavantgarde artists were [[Sandro Chia]], [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Enzo Cucchi]], [[Nicola de Maria]], [[Mimmo Paladino]] and [[Remo Salvadori]].

==Interior design==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SofaDueFoglie.png|thumb|right|200px|The ”Due Foglie” sofa, by [[Gio Ponti]]]] --&gt;
Italian interior design in the 20th century was particularly well-known and grew to the heights of class and sophistication.  At first, in the early 20th century, Italian furniture designers struggled to create an equal balance between classical elegance and modern creativity, and at first, Italian interior design in the 1910s and 1920s was very similar to that of French art deco styles, using exotic materials and creating sumptuous furniture. However, Italian art deco reached its pinnacle under [[Gio Ponti]], who made his designs sophisticated, elegant, stylish and refined, but also modern, exotic and creative. In 1926, a new style of furnishing emerged in Italy, known as ''"Razionalismo"'', or ''"Rationalism"''. The most successful and famous of the Rationalists were the Gruppo 7, led by [[Luigi Figini]], [[Gino Pollini]] and [[Giuseppe Terragni]]. There styles used tubular steel and was known as being more plain and simple, and almost Fascist in style after c. 1934. After [[World War II]], however, was the period in which Italy had a true ''avant-garde'' in interior design. With the fall of Fascism, rise of Socialism and the 1946 RIMA exhibition, Italian talents in interior decorating were made evident, and with the [[Italian economic miracle]], Italy saw a growth in industrial production and also mass-made furniture. Yet, the 1960s and 1970s saw Italian interior design reach its pinnacle of stylishness, and by that point, with Pop and post-modern interiors, the phrases ''"Bel Designo"'' and ''"Linea Italiana"'' entered the vocabulary of furniture design.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2005) p.486&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists==

[[Image:composizione 59 Accatino.jpg|thumb|right|200px|”Composizione”, 1959, Enrico Accatino]]
[[Michelangelo Pistoletto]] began painting on mirrors in 1962, connecting painting with the constantly changing realities in which the work finds itself. In the later 1960s he began bringing together rags with casts of omnipresent classical statuary of Italy to break down the hierarchies of "art" and common things. An art of impoverished materials is certainly one aspect of the definition of ''Arte Povera''. In his 1967 ''Muretto di straci'' (''Rag Wall'') Pistoletto makes an exotic and opulent tapestry wrapping common bricks in discarded scraps of fabric.

Artists such as [[Jannis Kounellis]] and [[Mario Merz]] attempted to make the experience of art more immediately real while also more closely connecting the individual to nature.

The leading sculptors from 1930-40 to 2000 included [[Marino Marini (sculptor)|Marino Marini]], Emilio Greco, [[Pino Pascali]], [[Mario Ceroli]], Giovanni e Arnaldo Pomodoro, [[Umberto Mastroianni]], Ettore Colla.

The leading painters from 1930-40 to 2000 included [[Alberto Savinio]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Giorgio Morandi]], [[Alberto Magnelli]], [[Felice Casorati]], [[Roberto Melli]], [[Corrado Cagli]], [[Gianfilippo Usellini]], [[Pietro Annigoni]], [[Renato Guttuso]], [[Lucio Fontana]], [[Giovanni Capogrossi]], [[Enrico Accatino]], [[Antonio Donghi]], [[Oreste Carpi]], [[Fausto Pirandello]], [[Afro Basaldella]], [[Alberto Burri]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], [[Franco Nonnis]], [[Domenico Gnoli (artist)|Domenico Gnoli]], [[Valerio Adami]], [[Piero Manzoni]], [[Emilio Tadini]], [[Salvatore Provino]], [[Mino Argento]].

A new breed of contemporary Italian artist such as [[Gaspare Manos]] are developing a more global language that draws on a vast international personal experience of life and culture stretching over several continents and many decades of travel.  Such artist think locally and act globally, like [[Rabarama]] who has been the first Italian sculptor to collaborate with the [[Cirque du Soleil]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabarama and Cirque du Soleil ([https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/11/idUSnHUGgsDfra+1c8+ONE20130311 Reuters])&lt;/ref&gt; An equivalent in Spain for example is the painter [[Miquel Barceló]].

[[File:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1987, MiNr 3090.jpg|thumb|East German stamp celebrating 35 years of LPGs]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1986-0813-020, LPG Großbothen, Getreideernte.jpg|thumb|Wheat harvest in an LPG in 1986]]
The German expression '''Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaft''' ([[English language|English]]: ''Agricultural Production Cooperative''), or &amp;mdash; more commonly &amp;mdash; its [[acronym]] '''LPG''' was the official designation for large, [[Collective farming|collectivised farms]] in [[East Germany]], corresponding to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[kolkhoz]]. 

The collectivisation of private and state owned agricultural land in East Germany was the progression of a policy of [[food security]] (at the expense of large scale [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] farmers).  It began in the years of [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet occupation]] (1945–48) as part of the need to govern resources in the [[Soviet Sector]].  Beginning with the forced [[Confiscation|expropriation]] of all land holdings in excess of 100 [[hectare|ha]], land was redistributed in small packets of around 5 to 7 ha to incoming landless refugees driven off lost German territory to the east. These ''Neubauern'' (new farmers) were given limited ownership rights to the land, meaning that they kept it as long as they worked it. In the early 1950s, remaining farmers with largish holdings (60 to 80 ha) were effectively driven out of business through means such as denying access to pooled machinery and by setting production targets that rose exponentially with amount of land owned to levels that were impossible to meet. 

Alongside these coercive actions of expropriation, old and new farmers with smaller land holdings were increasingly encouraged to pool resources in a legally constituted cooperative form, the LPG, in which initially just land but later animals and machinery were shared and worked together. These were not "state-owned" farms (although a few of [[Volkseigenes Gut|these]] did exist) - land, except as mentioned above, remained legally in private ownership and the LPG, although often dominated by [[communist party]] [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]], was a distinct legal entity operating independently as far as was feasible within the constraints of a [[planned economy]]. However, from the early 1960s, pressure mounted on remaining independent farmers to join the LPGs and for existing LPGs to merge in more fully collectivised forms. This process, and a drive to increased industrialisation, led in the 1970s to the separation of crop and animal production and the merging of each across villages to form much larger cooperative units in which, for example, one LPG for crop production with perhaps 3000 ha of land would supply feed to two LPGs working in animal production.

Following [[German reunification]] in 1990, the LPG was no longer a legal form of business and regulations were introduced governing their dissolution and the restructuring of enterprises into other legal forms. Some former LPG members, typically those with a strong family background in independent farming, reclaimed their land and started again as independent farmers building up to a viable farm size through renting. In most cases, however, former members or their children settled for some level of compensation in return for surrendering their membership rights to a smaller core group of former managers who then took over the business in the new form of a limited company ([[GmbH]]). This settlement and compensation process was at times fought over and at times accepted with resignation depending often on the amount of wealth to be distributed and on the degree of trust by the general membership and village population in the ability of managers to carry on the enterprise as successful employers. In some cases, an ''eingetragene Genossenschaft'', a form of [[cooperative farming]], persisted as allowed under existing German law.

She is also co-founder of the ''Process of Black Communities'' (PCN). She managed to secure more than 24,000&amp;nbsp;km² in territorial rights for the country's black rural communities, and she has been focused on protecting Colombia's Pacific rainforest. Libia Grueso received the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="goldman"&gt;Goldman Environmental Prize: [http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/106 Libia Grueso] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204051355/http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/106 |date=2007-12-04 }} (Retrieved on November 30, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of currently active [[Separatism|separatist]] movements in Europe'''. Separatism often refers to full political [[secession]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/separatism | title = Free Dictionary | contribution = Separatism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Separatism | contribution-url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/separatism | last1 = Merriam | last2 = Webster | title = Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Separatism | publisher = Encyclopedia | contribution-url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O999-separatist.html | title = The Oxford Pocket Dictionary of Current English | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; though separatist movements may seek nothing more than greater [[autonomy]] or to be recognised as a [[national minority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Harris| first = Jerry| title = The Nation in the Global Era Conflict and Transformation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UQQujqyOJJIC&amp;pg=PA320 | year = 2009| publisher = Brill | isbn = 90-04-17690-X | page = 320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is and is not considered an [[Autonomism|autonomist]] or secessionist movement is sometimes contentious. Entries on this list must meet three criteria:
# They are active movements with active members;
# They are seeking greater autonomy or [[self-determination]] for a geographic region (as opposed to [[National personal autonomy|personal autonomy]]);
# They are citizens/peoples of the conflict area and do not come from another country.

Under each region listed is one or more of the following:
* ''De facto'' state (de facto entity): for [[Diplomatic recognition|unrecognized]] regions with de facto autonomy;
* Proposed state: proposed name for a seceding sovereign state;
* Proposed autonomous area: for movements towards greater [[Autonomous area|autonomy for an area]] but not outright secession;
** De facto autonomous government: for governments with de facto autonomous control over a region;
** Government-in-exile: for a [[Government in exile|government based outside of the region in question]], with or without control;
** Political party (or parties): for political parties involved in a political system to push for autonomy or secession;
** Militant organisation(s): for armed organisations;
** Advocacy group(s): for [[Advocacy group|non-belligerent, non-politically participatory entities]];
** [[Ethnic]]/[[ethno-religious]]/[[racial]]/[[Regionalism (politics)|regional]]/[[Religious organization|religious]] group(s).

Various ethnic groups in Europe are seeking greater autonomy or independence. In the [[European Union]] (EU), several of these groups are members of the [[European Free Alliance]] (EFA). In some cases, the group seeks to unify into a different state – in cases where this does not involve the creation of a new state entity, this is considered to be [[irredentism]]. Analogous irredentist movements are included in the [[list of active irredentist movements]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13114">The '''Local Government Act of Bhutan''' ([[Dzongkha]]: འབྲུག་གི་ས་གནས་གཞུངས་སྤྱི་མོ་ཅན་མ་; [[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]:'' 'brug-gi sa-gans-gzhungs can-ma'') was enacted on September 11, 2009, by [[parliament of Bhutan|parliament]] of [[Bhutan]] in order to further implement its program of [[decentralization]] and devolution of power and authority.&lt;ref name=LGA09&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nab.gov.bt/downloadsact/Dzo74.pdf |format=PDF |title=Local Government Act of Bhutan 2009 |publisher=[[Government of Bhutan]] |date=2009-09-11 |accessdate=2011-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706162642/http://www.nab.gov.bt/downloadsact/Dzo74.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: Preamble&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most recent reform of the law on Bhutan's administrative divisions: [[Dzongkhag]]s, [[Dungkhag]]s, [[Gewog]]s, [[Chiwog]]s, and [[Thromde]]s (municipalities). The Local Government Act of Bhutan has been slightly amended in 2014&lt;ref&gt;The Local Government (Amendement) Act of Bhutan 2014 http://www.nab.gov.bt/assets/uploads/docs/acts/2015/local_Government_Act.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Provisions of the Act==
The Local Government Act of 2009 establishes local governments in each of the twenty Dzongkhags, each overseen ultimately by the [[Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs]].&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: §§ 206–208, 263, 294&lt;/ref&gt; The Act tasks all local governments with a variety of objectives, including promoting [[Gross National Happiness]]; providing democratic and accountable government; preserving culture and tradition; promoting development; protecting public health; and discharging any other duties specifically created by other law.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: § 48&lt;/ref&gt; Local governments are generally headed by a chairperson and a deputy chairperson who lead, represent, and manage their respective bureaucracies, each answering to the body above it and to parliament of Bhutan.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: §§ 66–85&lt;/ref&gt; All local governments are administrative divisions and are prohibited to make laws, however they are empowered to make rules and regulations consistent with law as established by parliament.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: §§ 3–6&lt;/ref&gt; Members of all local governments must be between ages 25 and 65, and sit for five-year terms, or until the local government is dissolved.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: §§ 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Dzongkhag governments===
The Act establishes Dzongkhag Tshogdu (District Council) as the highest decision making body in the [[Dzongkhag]]. The Dzongkhag Tshogdu is composed of the Gup and Mangmi (elected leaders) from each Gewog, one representative from that Dzongkhag Thromde, and one representative from the Dzongkhag Yenlag [[Thromde]]s.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: §§ 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Dzongkhag Tshogdus are tasked with balancing socio-economic development; promoting business; protecting consumers; coordinating government agency activities; reviewing Gewog regulations and ordinances; and representing the Dzongkhags in national referenda. The Dzongkhag Tshogdus are empowered to enforce rules on health and public safety; to regulate environmental pollution, advertising in regard to environmental aesthetics; to regulate broadcast media in accordance with the Information, Communications, and Media Act; and to regulate gambling. Dzongkhag Tshogdus also bear the responsibility for their own finances.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: §§ 49–52, 216–229&lt;/ref&gt; The Dzongkhag Tshogdus also oversee Dzongdags (governors), royal appointees who are the executive of each Dzongkhag. Dzongdags, in turn, are responsible for maintaining [[law enforcement in Bhutan|law and order]], and for enforcing the ''[[driglam namzha]]'' laws.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: §§ 250–264&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gewog governments===
The analogous body at the [[Gewog]] level is the Gewog Tshogde, composed of the Gup and Mangmi, plus five to eight more elected Tshogpas (councilmen).&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: §§ 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;  Gewog Tshogdes are, like Dzongkhag Tshogdus, responsible for enforcing rules on public health and safety and tasked with encouraging economic development. Gewog Tshogdes further regulate drinking and irrigation waters, mines, recreational areas, construction, land use, and agricultural activities in relation to the Forest and Nature Conservation Act. Gewog governments formulate five-year development plans, run their own budgets, and raise their own labor for public projects. These budgetary and developmental functions are subject to the approval and review of the Ministry of Finance. Gewog Tshogdes are empowered to levy taxes on land, buildings, cattle, grazing, entertainment, advertisement (other than in newspapers, print, radio, and internet), and anything else designated by parliament.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: §§ 53–60, 216–229&lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal governments===
The Act of 2009 presents no substantive change from previous law regarding the [[Dzongkhag]] Tshogdu, [[Gewog]] Tshogde, terms of local offices, and qualifications for office. Subordinate municipal divisions, however, are completely re-written.&lt;ref name=LGA09/&gt;&lt;ref name=LGA07/&gt;&lt;ref name=DYT02/&gt;&lt;ref name=GYT02/&gt;

Under the Act of 2009, a senior decision making body is established for some [[Thromde]]s (municipalities), the lowest level of administration. This body, called the Thromde Tshogde, is composed of seven to ten elected members and headed by a Thrompon. Every Thromde is classified as one of two types: Dzongkhag Yenlag Thromde and Dzongkhag Thromde; the latter is further subdivided into Class B Thromde and Class A Thromde based on population, development, and economy. Class A, or highest developed, Thromdes are allowed their own elected Thromde Tshogde; Class B Thromdes and Yenlag Thromdes are governed directly by either the Dzongkhag or the Gewog administration. From time to time, Parliament decides the boundaries of Thromde in consultation with the National Land Commission Secretariat and local authorities.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: §§ 11–18, 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Thromde Tshogdes are empowered to regulate advertising, enforce public health and safety rules, and to levy taxes on land, property, property transfer ([[sales tax]]) and, "betterment." The municipal governments are also authorized to levy special taxes on vacant and underdeveloped land to encourage development, and to raise and spend money in to promote local economic development.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: §§ 61–65&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Other provisions===
The Act of 2009 also codifies procedures for the dissolution of local governments, referenced but unspecified in previous legislation. Votes of confidence may be initiated by local populations when a written appeal convinces the Election Commission of Bhutan that more than half the population desires a poll. When the Commission approves a confidence poll, it is conducted within a month's time in the form of a yes-no question. At least two-thirds of any local population must vote "no" in order to dissolve the local government. Local governments, once dissolved, must be reconstituted within ninety days.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: §§ 36–47&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act of 2009 further provides a substantive and procedural framework for the roles and responsibilities of local government members, including conducting sessions and other business, voting, and record of proceedings and resolutions.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: §§ 86–140&lt;/ref&gt; It also mandates transparency and accountability through open sessions, public disclosure of information, and public participation.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: §§ 141–150&lt;/ref&gt; The Act of 2009 reforms offices within local bureaucracies, establishing secretariats at each level, creating a Thromde Executive Secretary, and allotting each bureaucracy with a staff of civil servants.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: §§ 230–249, 265–277&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Act of 2009, there is no reference whatever to [[Dungkhag]]s and [[Chiwog]]s, sub-dzongkhags and sub-gewogs respectively, recognized up through the previous Act of 2007. Because the Act of 2009 repeals all previous legislation on local governments whether or not it conflicts, the legal status of Chiwogs is reduced to electoral districts, and Dungkhags are retained as judicial districts ([[Dungkhag Court]]s) as described in the [[Constitution of Bhutan|Constitution of 2008]].&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: § 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CoBE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.bt/TsaThrim%20Eng%20(A5).pdf |title=The Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan |chapter=Articles 21–22 |format=PDF |date=2008-07-18 |publisher=[[Government of Bhutan]] |accessdate=2010-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706162637/http://www.constitution.bt/TsaThrim%20Eng%20%28A5%29.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical acts and local governments==
The Local Government Act of 2009 was preceded by the Local Government Act of 2007,&lt;ref name=LGA07&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nab.gov.bt/downloadsact/Eng30.pdf |format=PDF |title=Local Government Act of Bhutan 2007 |publisher=[[Government of Bhutan]] |date=2007-07-31 |accessdate=2011-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706163050/http://www.nab.gov.bt/downloadsact/Eng30.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Thromde Act of 2007,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: § 2&lt;/ref&gt; the Dzongkhag Yargay Tshogdu Chathrim of 2002,&lt;ref name=DYT02&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcouncil.bt/images/stories/DYT_En_02.pdf |format=PDF |title=Dzongkhag Yargay Tshogdu Chathrim 2002 |publisher=[[Government of Bhutan]] |date=2007-06-14 |accessdate=2011-01-20 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gewog Yargay Tshogchung Chathrim of 2002,&lt;ref name=GYT02&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcouncil.bt/images/stories/GYT_En_02.pdf |format=PDF |title=Geog Yargay Tshogchhung Chathrim 2002 |publisher=[[Government of Bhutan]] |date=2002-06-13 |accessdate=2011-01-20 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Bhutan Municipal Act 1999,&lt;ref name=LGA07/&gt; and other legislation. All previous acts were repealed by the enactment of the Local Government Act of 2009.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Local Gov't Act 2008: § 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1956, Bhutan had nine provinces headed by the [[penlop]]s: Byakar (centered in present-day Bumthang), Dukye, Haa, Paro, Punakha, Dagana, Thimphu, Trongsa, and Wangdue Phodrang. Later, the country was reorganized into dzongkhags. In August 1987, the territory of [[Gasa District|Gasa dzongkhag]] was divided between [[Punakha District|Punakha]] and [[Thimphu District|Thimphu]]; [[Chukha District|Chhukha dzongkhag]] was formed by merging the parts of [[Samtse District|Samtse]], [[Paro District|Paro]], and [[Thimphu District|Thimphu]].&lt;ref name=statoids&gt;{{cite web|last=Law |first=Gwillim |url=http://www.statoids.com/ubt.html |work=Administrative Divisions of Countries ("Statoids") |title=Districts of Bhutan |date=2010-12-18 |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=populstat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populstat.info/Asia/bhutanp.htm |last=Lahmeyer |first=Jan |title=BHUTAN – Historical Demographical Data of the Administrative Division | work=Population Statistics | year=2002 |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, [[Gasa District|Gasa dzongkhag]] was re-established and carved out from [[Punakha District|Punakha]]; the same year, [[Trashiyangtse District|Trashi Yangtse dzongkhag]] was carved out from [[Trashigang District|Trashigang]].&lt;ref name=statoids/&gt;&lt;ref name=populstat/&gt;

The Acts of 2002 (Dzongkhag Yargay Tshogdu Chathrim and Gewog Yargay Tshogchung Chathrim) established much of the basic legal framework for Dzongkhg and Gewog administration. This framework established offices and terms, election and meeting procedures, functions and regulatory powers, roles and responsibilities, and codes of conduct for local governments comparable to those that were re-codified in subsequent legislation.&lt;ref name=DYT02/&gt;&lt;ref name=GYT02/&gt;

The Local Government Act of 2007 authorized Dungkhags as intermediate divisions between Dzongkhags and Gewogs. These subdivisions were governed by Dungkhag Administration headed by a Dungpa. Under this Act, Gewogs were further subdivided into [[Chiwog]]s for Gewog administration. Aside from these legal subdivisions, the law of the Act of 2007 was largely retained, frequently verbatim, by the Act of 2009.&lt;ref name=LGA09/&gt;&lt;ref name=LGA07/&gt;

'''Local food''' ('''local food movement''' or '''locavore''') is a movement of people who prefer to eat foods which are grown or farmed relatively close to the places of sale and preparation. 

Local food movements aim to connect [[food producer]]s and food consumers in the same geographic region, in order to develop more [[self-reliant]] and resilient [[food chain|food network]]s; improve local economies; or to affect the [[public health|health]], environment, community, or society of a particular place.&lt;ref&gt;Feenstra, G. (2002) Creating space for sustainable food systems: lessons from the field. ''Agriculture and Human Values''. 19(2). 99-106.&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been extended to include not only the geographic location of supplier and consumer but can also be "defined in terms of social and [[supply chain]] characteristics."&lt;ref name="Martinez"&gt;{{cite web|last=Martinez|first=Steve|last2=Hand|first2=Michael|last3=Da Pra|first3=Michelle|last4=Pollack|first4=Susan|last5=Ralston|first5=Katherine|last6=Smith|first6=Travis|last7=Vogel|first7=Stephen|last8=Clark|first8=Shellye|last9=Lohr|first9=Luanne|last10=Low|first10=Sarah|last11=Newman|first11=Constance|date=May 2010|title=Economic Research Report Number 97: Local Food Systems Concepts, Impacts, and Issues|url=http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps125302/ERR97.pdf|publisher=Economic Research Service|accessdate=17 June 2018|agency=ERS (Economic Research Service)}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, local food initiatives often promote [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable]] and [[organic farming]] practices, although these are not explicitly related to the geographic proximity of producer and consumer.

Local food represents an alternative to the [[globalization|global]] food model, a model which often sees food [[transport|traveling long distances]] before it reaches the consumer. A local food network involves relationships between food producers, distributors, retailers, and consumers in a particular place, where they work together to increase food security and ensure economic, ecological and social sustainability of a community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunne|first=Jonnie B.|author2=Chambers, Kimberlee J. |author3=Giombolini, Katlyn J. |author4=Schlegel, Sheridan A. |title=What does ‘local’ mean in the grocery store?

== History ==
In the USA, the local food movement has been traced to the creation of the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] (AAA) of 1933, which spawned today's controversial [[agricultural subsidies]] and price supports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essaysinhistory.com/content/historical-reflections-current-local-food-and-agriculture-movement|title=Historical Reflections on the Current Local Food and Agriculture Movement {{!}} Essays in History|website=www.essaysinhistory.com|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary American movement associated with the term can be traced back to proposed resolutions to the [[Society for Nutrition Education]]'s 1981 guidelines. These largely unsuccessful resolutions encouraged increased local production to slow farmland loss. The program described "sustainable diets" - a term then new to the American public. At the time, the resolutions were met with strong criticism from pro-business institutions, but have had a strong resurgence of backing since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gussow|first1=Joan|title=Dietary Guidelines for Sustainability: Twelve Years Later|journal=Society for Nutrition Education|date=July 1998|url=http://www.jneb.org/article/S0022-3182%2899%2970441-3/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, revisions were made to the United States [[United States farm bill|Farm Bill]] which put an emphasis on nutrition: "it provides low-income seniors with vouchers for use at local produce markets, and it added more than $1 billion to the fresh fruit and vegetable program, which serves healthy snacks to 3 million low-income children in schools".&lt;ref name="search.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Dannenburg|first1 = Andrew|title = Making healthy places designing and building for health, well-being, and sustainability|date = 2011|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;scope=site&amp;db=nlebk&amp;db=nlabk&amp;AN=385339|accessdate = 11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions of "local" ==
[[File:Goats and cheesemaking workshop, Maker Faire 2011.jpg|thumb|A [[Cheesemaker|cheesemaking]] [[workshop]] with goats at [[Maker Faire]] 2011. The sign declares, "Eat your [[ZIP code|Zipcode]]!"]]

No single definition of "local" or "local food systems" exists. The geographic distances between production and consumption varies within the movement. However, the general public recognizes that "local" describes the marketing arrangement (e.g. farmers selling directly to consumers at regional [[farmers' market]]s or to schools).&lt;ref name="Martinez"/&gt; There are "a number of different definitions for local [that] have been used or recorded by researchers assessing local food systems [and] most [are] informed by political or geographic boundaries. Among the more widely circulated and popular defining parameters is the concept of [[food miles]], which has been suggested for policy recommendations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunne|first=Jonnie B.|title=What does ‘local’ mean in the grocery store? Multiplicity in food retailers' perspectives on sourcing and marketing local foods|journal=Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems|author2=Chambers, Kimberlee J. |author3=Giombolini, Katlyn J. |author4=Schlegel, Sheridan A. |pages=46–59|doi=10.1017/S1742170510000402}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008]] includes a definition, with "locally" and "regionally" grouped together and defined as:

{{quote|‘‘(I) the locality or region in which the final product is marketed, so that the total distance that the product is transported is less than 400 miles from the origin of the product; or&lt;br&gt;‘‘(II) the State in which the product is produced.|[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-110hr2419enr/pdf/BILLS-110hr2419enr.pdf H. R. 2419]}}

In May 2010 the USDA acknowledged this definition in an informational leaflet.&lt;ref name="Martinez"/&gt;

The concept of "local" is also seen in terms of [[ecology]], where food production is considered from the perspective of a basic ecological unit defined by its climate, soil, [[drainage basin|watershed]], [[species]] and local [[agrisystem]]s, a unit also called an [[ecoregion]] or a [[foodshed|food shed]]. Similar to watersheds, food sheds follow the process of where food comes from and where it ends up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/what_is_a_food_shed|title=What is a food shed?|work=MSU Extension|access-date=2017-03-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "local" is widely understood by the general public as a description of regional distribution of food, though that does not involve a regulation of distance between the farmer, their food and the consumer. It is the consumer's responsibility to conclude how "local" the food is.

== Contemporary local food market ==
The USDA included statistics about the growing local food market in the leaflet released in May 2010. The statistics are as follows: "Direct-to-consumer marketing amounted to $1.2 billion in current dollar sales in 2007, according to the 2007 Census of Agriculture, compared with $551 million in 1997. Direct-to-consumer sales accounted for 0.4 percent of total agricultural sales in 2007, up from 0.3 percent in 1997. If non-edible products are excluded from total agricultural sales, direct-to-consumer sales accounted for 0.8 percent of agricultural sales in 2007. The number of farmers' markets rose to 5,274 in 2009, up from 2,756 in 1998 and 1,755 in 1994, according to USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service. In 2005, there were 1,144 community-supported agriculture organizations (CSAs) in operation, up from 400 in 2001 and 2 in 1986, according to a study by the nonprofit, nongovernmental organization National Center for Appropriate Technology. In early 2010, estimates exceeded 1,400, but the number could be much larger. The number of farm to school programs, which use local farms as food suppliers for school meals programs, increased to 2,095 in 2009, up from 400 in 2004 and 2 in the 1996-97 school year, according to the National Farm to School Network. Data from the 2005 School Nutrition and Dietary Assessment Survey, sponsored by USDA's Food and Nutrition Service, showed that 14 percent of school districts participated in Farm to School programs, and 16 percent reported having guidelines for [[local purchasing|purchasing locally grown produce]]."&lt;ref name="Martinez"/&gt;

Using metrics including some of those cited above, a Vermont-based farm and food advocacy organization, [[Strolling of the Heifers]], publishes the annual Locavore Index, a ranking of the 50 U.S. states plus [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[District of Columbia]]. In the 2016 Index, the three top-ranking states were Vermont, Maine and Oregon, while the three lowest-ranking states were Nevada, Texas and Florida.&lt;ref name="strollingoftheheifers.com"&gt;"[http://www.strollingoftheheifers.com/locavoreindex/ Strolling of the Heifers 2016 Locavore Index: Which states are most committed to locally-sourced food?]," Strolling of the Heifers&lt;/ref&gt;

Networks of local farmers and producers are now collaborating in the UK, Canada and the US to provide online farmers' markets to consumers. This technological change enables more consumers to participate in farmers' markets. This development also allows local farmers and producers to harvest and prepare produce according to orders, and means that farmers are also able to spread the website costs.  Consumers have access to a huge inventory of farms and their products, without having to be locked into buying whatever a CSA provides.

Websites now exist that aim to connect people to local food growers. They often include a map where fruit and vegetable growers can pinpoint their location and advertise their produce.

Supermarket chains also participate in the local food scene. In 2008 [[Walmart]] announced plans to invest $400 million in locally grown produce.&lt;ref name=burros&gt;{{cite news|last=Burros|first=Marian|title=Supermarket Chains Narrow Their Sights|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/06/dining/06local.html|accessdate=20 July 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other chains, like Wegman's (a 71-store chain across the northeast), have a long and cooperative history with the local food movement. In this chain's case, each store's produce manager oversees the influx of local foods.&lt;ref name=burros/&gt; A recent study led by Miguel Gomez, a professor of Applied Economics and Management at [[Cornell University]], in cooperation with the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]], found that in many instances, the supermarket supply chain did much better in terms of food miles and fuel consumption for each pound compared to farmers markets. The study suggests that selling locally grown foods through supermarkets may be more economically viable and sustainable than through farmers' markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prevor|first=Jim|title=Jim Prevor's Perishable Pundit|url=http://www.perishablepundit.com/index.php?date=10/01/10&amp;pundit=1|accessdate=20 July 2011|date=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locavore and invasivore==

A "locavore" or "localvore" (the term is a [[neologism]]) is a person interested in eating food that is locally produced, not moved long distances to market. One common – but not universal – definition of "local" food is food grown within {{convert|100|mi}} of its point of purchase or consumption.&lt;ref name="The Lure of the 100-Mile Diet"&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1200783,00.html The Lure of the 100-Mile Diet]", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (June 11, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The locavore movement in the United States and elsewhere was spawned as a result of interest in [[sustainability]] and eco-consciousness becoming more prevalent.&lt;ref name=Locavores&gt;[http://www.locavores.com/ The Locavores website].&lt;/ref&gt; The word "locavore" was the word of the year for 2007 in the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary|Oxford American Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://blog.oup.com/2007/11/locavore/ Oxford Word Of The Year: Locavore]". [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; The suffix "vore" comes from the Latin word ''vorare'' (as in "devour"), and is used to form nouns indicating what kind of a diet an animal has. This word was the creation of [[Jessica Prentice]] of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] at the time of [[UN World Environment Day|World Environment Day]] 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://blog.oup.com/2007/11/prentice/ The Birth of Locavore| OUPBlog]".[[OUPBlog]].&lt;/ref&gt; It may be rendered "localvore", depending on regional differences.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005106.html Locavore or localvore?]" ''Language Log''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;Drake Bennett (July 22, 2007). "[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/07/22/the_localvores_dilemma/ The localvore's dilemma]", ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, an "invasivore" movement has emerged as a subset of the locavore movement, which encourages the consumption of nonindigenous [[invasive species]] with the intent of controlling harmful populations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/weekinreview/02gorman.html A Diet for an Invaded Planet. New York Times January 2, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local food campaigns==

Locavores are interested in affecting their community by supporting the local farmers. The locavore movement has been successful in supporting small local farmers. After declining for more than a century, the number of small farms has increased 20% in the past six years, to 1.2 million, according to the Agriculture Department.&lt;ref&gt;Gogoi, Pallavi.

===North Carolina 10% campaign===
Launched in late 2009,  North Carolina's 10% campaign is aimed at stimulating economic development, creating jobs and promoting the state's agricultural offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cefs.ncsu.edu/resources/a-community-and-local-government-guide-to-developing-local-food-systems-in-north-carolina-2013/|title=A Community and Local Government Guide to Developing Local Food Systems in North Carolina|date=2013|publisher=Center for Environmental Farming Systems|website=cefs.ncsu.edu|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The campaign is a partnership between The Center for Environmental Farming Systems (CEFS), with support from N.C. Cooperative Extension and the [[Golden LEAF Foundation]]. More than 4,600 individuals and 543 businesses, including 76 restaurants, have signed on to the campaign through the website nc10percent.com, pledging to spend 10 percent of their food budget on locally sourced foods. Participants receive weekly emails prompting them to record how much they have spent on local food that week. Currently the campaign reports that more than $14 million has been recorded by participants. "The $10 million mark is a true testament to the commitment of our agricultural community and the quality of North Carolina-grown products."&lt;ref&gt;"North Carolina campaign promoting locally grown food." Southeast Farm Press [Online Exclusive] 22 Nov. 2011. General OneFile. Web. 11 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Environmental Farming Systems estimates that if all North Carolinians allocated 10% of their food expenditures to locally produced food, $3.5 billion would be generated for the state's economy. [[Brunswick County, North Carolina|Brunswick]], [[Cabarrus County, North Carolina|Cabarrus]], [[Chatham County, North Carolina|Chatham]], [[Guilford County, North Carolina|Guilford]], [[Forsyth County, North Carolina|Forsyth]], [[Onslow County, North Carolina|Onslow]] and [[Rockingham County, North Carolina|Rockingham]] counties have adopted resolutions in support of the campaign. Stores are advertising local products with buy-local food labels. CEFS' co-director Nancy Creamer explains: "North Carolina is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the increased consumer demand for locally produced foods
...Agriculture is the backbone of our economy. The state's climate, soils and coastal resources support production of a wide variety of produce, meats, fish and seafood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=10% campaign off to a strong start|date=January 2011|magazine=NC Farm Bureau Magazine|url=http://www.ncfbmagazine.org/2011/01/10-campaign-off-to-strong-start/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426045040/http://www.ncfbmagazine.org/2011/01/10-campaign-off-to-strong-start/|archivedate=26 April 2012|deadurl=yes}}

===Growing Power, Inc.===
[[Urban environment]]s are known for their food deserts in areas of [[poverty]], and most of the food available is shipped in. Growing Power, Inc. has a mission of "helping to provide equal access to healthy, high-quality, safe and affordable food for people in all communities".&lt;ref name="Growing Power"&gt;{{cite web|title=Growing Power|url=http://www.growingpower.org|website=growingpower.org|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several farms in the Madison, Milwaukee, and Chicago area are [[good agricultural practice]] (GAP) certified.

==Motivations for eating local==
There are a number of reasons why people choose to participate in the locavore lifestyle. Motivations include healthier food, environmental benefits, and economic or community benefits. Many local farmers whom locavores turn to for their source of food use the [[crop rotation]] method when producing their organic crops. This method not only aids in reducing the use of pesticides and pollutants, but also keeps the soil in good condition rather than depleting it.&lt;ref&gt;"The Local Food Movement." ''Opposing Viewpoints Online Collection.''Detroit: Gale, 2010. ''Opposing Viewpoints in Context.'' Web. 12 Feb. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Locavores seek out farmers close to where they live, and this significantly reduces the amount of travel time taken for the food to get from the farm to the table. Reducing the travel time makes it possible to transport the crops while they are still fresh, without using chemical preservatives.&lt;ref&gt;"The Local Food Movement." ''Opposing Viewpoints Online Collection''. Detroit: Gale, 2010. ''Opposing Viewpoints in Context''. Web. 12 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of local farming techniques and short travel distances makes the food consumed more likely to be organic and fresh, an added benefit.

==Benefits of eating local==

===Community benefits===
A community supported agriculture system is extremely beneficial to a community because it "enables consumers to support local farmers, obtain food that might be fresher than store-bought food, and learn more information from farmers about how the food is grown." Furthermore, local eating can support public objectives. It can promote community interaction by fostering relationships between farmers and consumers. Even shopping experiences and interaction at local farmers' markets have public benefits such as "bonus-incentive or gleaning programs, the hosting of health sessions and dissemination of informational materials, and establishment of an organized central location that facilitates community engagement." In fact, farmers' markets inspire more sociable behavior. Studies show that 75% of shoppers at farmers' markets arrived in groups while only 16% of shoppers at supermarkets arrive in groups. Only 9% of customers in chain supermarkets had a social interaction with another customer, and 14% had an interaction with an employee, but at farmers' markets, 63% had an interaction with a fellow shopper, and 42% had an interaction with an employee or farmer.&lt;ref name="UCS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/market-forces-report.pdf|title=Market Forces: Creating Jobs through Public Investment in Local and Regional Food Systems|first=Jeffrey K.|last=O'Hara|date=August 2011|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists—Citizens and Scientists for Environmental Solutions|website=ucsusa.org|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local food builds community vibrancy and retains local traditions while establishing a local identity through a unique sense of community. [[urban agriculture|Urban gardens]] as shown in the documentary, "Urban Roots" are another solution to creating local food that greatly benefits the community as a whole. These urban gardens create local produce as well as educational and social opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;''Urban Roots''. Dir. Mark McInnis. 2011. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== User groups ====
Food accessibility is a topic that affects everyone in America. Supermarkets tend to carry foods that have been shipped halfway around the world, chemically ripened, and off-season. However, more affluent areas tend to have at least some access to local, [[organic food]]. Low-income communities are especially vulnerable to [[food desert]]s, areas in which there is little to no access to healthy food. These neighborhoods not only lack healthy food, but are overrun with unhealthy options; "disadvantaged neighborhoods are often replete with calorie-dense, low-quality food options", which adds to the obesity crisis rampant in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dannenberg|first1=Andrew|title=Making healthy places designing and building for health, well-being, and sustainability|date=2011|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;scope=site&amp;db=nlebk&amp;db=nlabk&amp;AN=385339|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, many low-income areas correlate to highly African-American and Hispanic populations, so in many ways, food deserts tend to continually marginalize these races. These groups are then continually categorized as vulnerable populations. The study conducted by Taylor Eagle et al. gives a strong example between the correlation between socioeconomic class and accessibility to fruits and vegetables. It also exemplifies the prevalence of unhealthy food in more impoverished areas of Michigan cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eagle|first1=Taylor|title=Understanding Childhood Obesity in America: Linkages between Household Income, Community Resources, and Children's Behaviors|date=2012|publisher=American Heart Journal|pages=836–843|edition=163.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This study focused on a particular demographic: children in school. The test subjects were 6th grade children and although the focus was on mean income correlating with food consumption, the test site was the cafeteria. [[Childhood obesity]] is highly linked to adult obesity so in order to be effective one must target the younger subset. Targeting a younger subset is the best plan because to achieve full growth and reduce their risk of diseases, children must eat healthy into their adolescent years.&lt;ref name="Shannon, C. 2002"&gt;Shannon, C., Story, M., Fulkerson, J. A., &amp; French, S. A. (2002). Factors in the school cafeteria influencing food choices by high school students. School Health, 72(6), 229-234.&lt;/ref&gt;  A cafeteria creates an atmosphere of little choice;. According to Terry Huang, "schools play a vital and visible role in their communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huang|first1=Terry|title=Healthy Eating Design Guidelines for School Architecture|date=2013|edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Why is there no better model for food accessibility in these arenas? Children can become a user group for food accessibility, as they are models for the future health of this country. What children choose to eat will affect their food choices at an older age.&lt;ref name="Shannon, C. 2002"/&gt; In other words, what we eat as children is what we will eat as adults unless change is forced at schools. This trend continues even into college, where students play an active role in changing the face of food. College students are of one of the worst demographics of unhealthy eaters and this becomes a target for providing local, natural food access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ward|first1=Rachel|title=The Development and Implementation of a Student-Led Farmers’ Market on a Public University Campus|date=2014|publisher=Journal of Hunger &amp; Environmental Nutrition|pages=81–95|edition=9.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, people in low-income areas and school children are undernourished and overfed. Low-income populations should focus on joining together as a community to ask for these local sources of food as well as educate their peers about the dangers of fast food. School children should also have access to education to begin lifelong healthy-eating habits. This opens up a pocket of opportunity that will not only aid health, but also help build community in diverse areas.

===Environmental benefits===
Local foods are sometimes considered the most climate friendly because the energy needed to store and transport the food is removed from the equation. There is a decrease in [[greenhouse gas]]es emitted because locally grown goods do not need to be transported across the country, or constantly cooled in large refrigerators. Another benefit of locally grown food is its lower concentration of pollution sources. According to the USDA, more than 335 million tons of [[manure]] are produced annually in American farms. In [[intensive animal farming|factory farms]], this waste is extremely concentrated, and without proper regulation and disposal, the waste pollutes the surrounding areas. The Natural Resource Defense Council even remarks that factory farms have reached a point in which the farms threaten public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = NRDC: Pollution from Giant Livestock Farms Threatens Public Health|url = http://www.nrdc.org/water/pollution/nspills.asp|website = www.nrdc.org|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollutants from the manure and urine of overcrowded factory farms lead to water and air pollution. Some of these pollutants, such as hydrogen sulfide and various nitrates, are dangerous even at low levels. Factory farms are also considered unsanitary because they place animals in overcrowded conditions in fully enclosed rooms that often become the perfect breeding grounds for diseases.  Locally grown foods support free-range or pasture-grazing farming methods, decreasing the need for large factory farms. With fewer factory farms, waste will not be so concentrated and will thus not have such profound effects on the immediate surrounding areas.

Growing and selling foods locally saves the environment from serious detriments. With local farms, "food miles" can essentially be eliminated, which includes the accompanying pollution. There would be no need to establish more expansive industrial farms that contaminate the soil, whereas local farmers are able to preserve soil for sustainability.

===Economic benefits===
A critical objective for any community is to promote investments that serve to increase the economic and social opportunities available for residents. If the United States wishes to sustain current agricultural production in the future, there must be a market for emerging farmers to counter the effects of a collectively aging farmer population. The introduction of farmers' markets into the local economy can directly benefit the lives of all citizens within the community. In a study conducted in the state of Iowa (Hood 2010), it was concluded that the introduction of 152 farmers' markets into the state economy led to the creation of 576 jobs, a $59.4 million increase in output, and a $17.8 million increase in income UCSUSA report.&lt;ref name="UCS"/&gt;

While this is just one state, other studies conducted in different regions have produced similar results on the economic benefit of more local farming on a specific community. Otto's study further reported that each individual farmers' market produced 3.8 new jobs per market. However, these economic developments are not limited to local food markets. Surveys of towns in Oregon, Lev, Brewer, and Stephenson (2003), found that farmers' markets were the primary reason that tourists visited local towns on the weekend. The gross economic effect can be calculated, as in the case of the Crescent City Farmers Market in New Orleans, where this single market contributed over $10 million to the local economy. The potential reauthorization of the Federal Farmers Market Promotion Program led to the creation of thousands of jobs within local economies, and further collective economic growth. The logical conclusion is that with the increase in economic benefits due to local farming, room is created in this ever-expanding industry.

==Criticism==

=== Food miles ===
Critics of the local foods movement question the fundamental principles behind the push to eat locally. For example, the concept that fewer "food miles" translates to a more sustainable meal has not been supported by major scientific studies. According to a study conducted at [[Lincoln University (New Zealand)|Lincoln University]] in [[New Zealand]]: "As a concept, food miles has gained some traction with the popular press and certain groups overseas. However, this debate which only includes the distance food travels is spurious as it does not consider total energy use especially in the production of the product."&lt;ref&gt;[[Caroline Saunders]], [[Andrew Barber]], and Greg Taylor, "Food Miles – Comparative Energy/Emissions Performance of New Zealand's Agriculture Industry" Research Report No. 285 Lincoln University, New Zealand, July 2007. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The locavore movement has been criticized by Dr. Vasile Stănescu, the co-senior editor of the ''[[Critical Animal Studies]]'' book series, as being idealistic and for not actually achieving the environmental benefits of the claim that the reduced food miles decreases the amount of gasses emitted.&lt;ref&gt;Stănescu, Vasile (2010).

The Myth of Sustainable Meat and the Danger of the Local]" (PDF). ''Journal for Critical Animal Studies'' 8(1/2):8–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that the amount of gasses saved by local transportation, while existing, does not have a significant enough impact to consider it a benefit.

The only study to date that directly focuses on whether or not a local diet is more helpful in reducing greenhouse gases was conducted by Christopher L. Weber and H. Scott Matthews at [[Carnegie-Mellon]]. They concluded that "dietary shift can be a more effective means of lowering an average household's food-related climate footprint than ‘buying local’".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher L. Weber and H. Scott Matthews, "Food-Miles and the Relative Climate Impacts of Food Choices in the United States " Environ. Sci. Technol., 42, no.10 (2008): 3508.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental impact ===
Numerous studies have shown that locally and sustainably grown foods actually release more greenhouse gases than food made in factory farms. The "Land Degradation" section of the [[United Nations]] report ''Livestock's Long Shadow'' concludes that "[[Intensive farming|Intensification]] - in terms of increased productivity both in livestock production and in feed crop agriculture - can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from [[deforestation]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options." Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options. United Nations, n.d. Web. 11 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan Pelletier of [[Dalhousie University]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] found that cattle raised on open pastures release 50% more greenhouse gas emissions than cattle raised in factory farms.&lt;ref&gt;Raloff, Janet. "AAAS: Climate-friendly Dining ... Meats | Environment | Science News."AAAS: Climate-friendly Dining ... Meats | Environment | Science News. N.p., n.d. Web. 11 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adrian Williams]] of [[Cranfield University]] in England found that [[free range]] and organic raised chickens have a 20% greater impact on global warming than chickens raised in factory farm conditions, and organic egg production had a 14% higher impact on the climate than factory farm egg production.  &lt;!-- (I'm commenting the following phrase out because I can't tell if it's meant to be a reference, or part of a sentence, and it makes no sense as written. If you can elaborate in a way that makes sense, please do. Thanks!) Stănescu, Vasille. "Green Eggs and Ham? The Myth of Sustainable Meat --&gt; Studies such as Christopher Weber's report on food miles have shown that the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions in production far outweighs those in transportation, which implies that locally grown food is actually worse for the environment than food made in factory farms.

=== Economic feasibility ===
While locavorism has been promoted as a feasible alternative to modern food production, some believe it might negatively affect the efficiency of production.&lt;ref name="independent.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=934|title=Book Review: The Locavore's Dilemma: In Praise of the 10,000-Mile Diet|website=The Independent Institute|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As technological advances have influenced the amount of output of farms, the productivity of farmers has skyrocketed in the last 70 years. These latter criticisms combine with deeper concerns of food safety, cited on the lines of the historical pattern of economic or food safety inefficiencies of [[subsistence farming]] which form the topic of the book ''[[The Locavore's Dilemma]]'' by geographer [[Pierre Desrochers (geographer)|Pierre Desrochers]] and public policy scholar [[Hiroko Shimizu]].&lt;ref name="independent.org"/&gt;

'''Michael X''' (1933 &amp;ndash; 16 May 1975), born '''Michael de Freitas''' in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], was a self-styled [[Black (people)|black]] [[revolutionary]] and [[civil rights]] [[Activism|activist]] in 1960s [[London]]. He was also known as '''Michael Abdul Malik''' and '''Abdul Malik'''. Convicted of [[murder]] in 1972, Michael X was executed by [[hanging]] in 1975 in [[Port of Spain]]'s Royal Jail.

==Biography==
Michael de Freitas was born in Trinidad to an "[[Obeah]]-practising black woman from Barbados and an absent Portuguese father from [[St Kitts]]".&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;[[Margaret Busby|Busby, Margaret]], [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/michael-x-a-life-in-black-and-white-by-john-williams-887845.html "Notting Hill to death row"] (review of ''Michael X: A Life In Black And White'', by John Williams), ''[[The Independent]]'', 8 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged by his mother to [[Passing (racial identity)|pass for white]], "Red Mike" was a headstrong youth and was expelled from school at the age of 14.&lt;ref name=Independent /&gt; In 1957, he immigrated to the [[United Kingdom]], where he settled in London and worked as an enforcer and frontman for the [[slumlord|slum landlord]] [[Peter Rachman]].&lt;ref&gt;Fountain, Nigel, ''Underground: The London Alternative Press, 1966-74'', London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1988, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1960s he had renamed himself "Michael X" and became a well-known exponent of [[Black Power]] in London. Writing in ''[[The Observer]]'' in 1965, Colin McGlashan called him the "authentic voice of black bitterness."&lt;ref name=didion&gt;Didion, Joan (12 June 1980) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/7366 "Without Regret or Hope."] ''New York Review of Books.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, under the name Abdul Malik, he founded the Racial Adjustment Action Society (RAAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | authorlink= | last = Werbner | first = Pnina  | year = 1991 | title =Black and Ethnic Leaderships in Britain: The Cultural Dimensions of Political Action | publisher = Routledge | publication-place = London | page = 29. | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 he was involved with the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]/hippie organisation the [[London Free School]] (LFS) through his contact with [[John Hopkins (political activist)|John "Hoppy" Hopkins]], which both helped widen the reach of the group, at least in the [[Notting Hill]] area, and create problems with local police who disliked his involvement. Michael and the LFS were instrumental in organising the first outdoor [[Notting Hill Carnival]] later that year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Miles|Miles, Barry]] (2010), ''London Calling: A Countercultural History of London Since 1945'', pp. 187–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, he became the first non-white person to be charged and imprisoned under the UK's [[Race Relations Act 1965|Race Relations Act]], which was designed to protect Britain's Black and [[Asian people|Asian]] populations from [[discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;Eds. (10 November 1967), "Black Muslim Gets One Year in Britain." ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to 12 months in jail for advocating the immediate killing of any white man seen "laying hands" on a black woman.&lt;ref&gt;Eds. (30 September 1967), "Michael X On Trial For Race Hate Charges", ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also said "white men have no soul".&lt;ref&gt;Gelber, Katharine, ''Speaking Back: the free speech versus hate speech debate'', John Benjamins, 2002, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, he became the self-appointed leader of a [[Black Power]] [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] on [[Holloway Road]], [[North London]], called the "Black House". The commune was financed by a young millionaire benefactor, [[Nigel Samuel]].  Michael X said, "They've made me the archbishop of violence in this country. But that 'get a gun' rhetoric is over. We're talking of really building things in the community needed by people in the community. We're keeping a sane approach."&lt;ref&gt;Eds. (29 January 1970) "London Getting a Black Cultural Leader." ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] donated a bag of their hair to be auctioned for the benefit of the Black House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Cavett, Dick | date=11 September 1971 | title=The Dick Cavett Show | medium=Television | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kXCnKfdGOY&amp;t=442 | accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In what the media called "the slave collar affair", businessman Marvin Brown was enticed to The Black House, viciously attacked, and made to wear a spiked "slave" collar around his neck as Michael X and others threatened him in order to [[extortion|extort]] money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk |title=Man In Michael X Centre led in 'slave collar'. |publisher=''The Times'' |date=23 June 1970 |accessdate=13 November 2008 | location=London | first=Philippe | last=Naughton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Black House closed in the autumn of 1970. The two men found guilty of assaulting Marvin Brown were imprisoned for 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk |title=Two found guilty in Black Power case. |work=[[The Times]] |date=14 July 1971 |accessdate=13 November 2008 | location=London | first=Philippe | last=Naughton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black House burned down in mysterious circumstances, and soon Michael X and four colleagues were arrested for extortion. His bail was paid by John Lennon in January 1971.&lt;ref name=harry&gt;[[Bill Harry|Harry, Bill]], ''The John Lennon Encyclopedia'', Virgin Books, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1971, he fled to his native Trinidad, where he started an agricultural commune devoted to [[black power|Black empowerment]] {{Convert|16|mi|km}} east of the capital, [[Port of Spain]].  "The only politics I ever understand is the politics of revolution," he told the ''[[Trinidad Express]]''.  "The politics of change, the politics of a completely new system."&lt;ref name=didion /&gt;  He began another commune, also called the Black House, which, in February 1972, also burned down.

===Murder trial===
Police who had come to the commune to investigate the fire discovered the bodies of Joseph Skerritt and [[Gale Benson]], members of the commune. They had been hacked to death and separately buried in shallow graves. Benson, who had been going under the name Hale Kimga, was the daughter of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Leonard F. Plugge]]. She had met Michael X through her relationship with [[Malcolm X]]'s cousin [[Hakim Jamal]].

Michael X fled to [[Guyana]] a few days later and was captured there. He was charged with the murder of Skerritt and Benson, but was never tried for the latter crime.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;UPS (17 May 1975) "Militant is Hanged in Trinidad After Long Fight for Clemency." ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; A witness at his trial claimed that Skerritt was a member of Malik's "[[Black Liberation Army]]" and had been killed by him because he refused to obey orders to attack a local police station. Malik was found guilty and sentenced to death.   The Save Malik Committee, whose members included [[Angela Davis]], [[Dick Gregory]], [[Kate Millet]] and others, including the well known "radical lawyer" [[William Kunstler]], who was paid by [[John Lennon]],&lt;ref name=harry/&gt; pleaded for clemency, but Malik was hanged in 1975.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Other members of the group were tried for Benson's murder.  It was asserted that Benson had been shown an open grave and was then pushed in it and hacked at by Michael X with a [[machete]] on her neck.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters (22 August 1972), "Michael X Doomed in Trinidad Murder." ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Under the name Michael Abdul Malik, Michael X was the author of ''From Michael Freitas to Michael X'' ([[André Deutsch]], 1968). It was ghost written by [[John Stevenson (writer)|John Stevenson]]. Michael X also left behind fragments of a novel about a romantic black hero who wins the abject admiration of the narrator, a young English woman named Lena Boyd-Richardson. Inspecting the hero's bookshelf, Lena Boyd-Richardson is impressed at finding ''[[Salammbô (novel)|Salammbô]]'': "I discover that he not only have (sic) the books but actually reads and understands them I was absolutely bowld (sic), litterally. I took a seat, and gazed upon this marvel, Mike."&lt;ref name=didion/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barfoot, C. C., and Theo d' Haen, ''Shades of Empire in Colonial and Post-colonial Literatures: In Colonial and Post-colonial Literatures'', Rodopi, 1993, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
Michael X is the subject of the essay "Michael X and the Black Power Killings in Trinidad" by [[V. S. Naipaul]], collected in ''The Return of Eva Perón and the Killings in Trinidad'' (1980), and is also believed to be the model for the fictional character Jimmy Ahmed in Naipaul's 1975 [[novel]] ''[[Guerillas (book)|Guerrillas]]''.

Michael X is a character in ''[[The Bank Job]]'' (2008), a dramatisation of [[Baker Street robbery|a real-life bank robbery]] in 1971. The film claims that Michael X was in possession of indecent photographs of [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] and used them to avoid criminal prosecution by threatening to publish them. He was played by [[Peter de Jersey]].

Michael X and his trial are the subject of a chapter in [[Geoffrey Robertson]]'s legal memoir ''The Justice Game'' (1998).

Michael X plays a part in ''Make Believe: A True Story'' (1993), a memoir by [[Diana Athill]].

''Michael X'' is the eponymous title of a play, by the writer [[Vanessa Walters]], that takes the form of a 1960s Black Power rally and was performed at [http://www.carnivalvillage.org.uk/ The Tabernacle Theatre], [[Powis Square, London|Powis Square]], London W11 (Notting Hill), in November 2008.

Michael X (played by [[Adrian Lester]]) is portrayed in a scene opposite [[Jimi Hendrix]] in the film ''[[All Is By My Side]]'' based on Jimi's early years in the music industry.

Muhammad Ali gave his bloody boxing shorts that he wore when he fought Henry Cooper to Michael Abdul Malik, and is referred to as a black militant from Trinidad in "The Greatest - My Own Story" by [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Richard Durham]]

The '''Ministry of National Defense''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Ministerium für Nationale Verteidigung - MfNV'') was the chief administrative arm of the East German [[National People's Army]]. The MND was modeled on the [[Ministry of Defense (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Defense]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. The headquarters of the Ministry was in [[Strausberg]] near [[East Berlin]]. The [[Guard Regiment Hugo Eberlein]] provided security and guard services to the Ministry. The Ministry also had its own publishing house, [[Military publishing house of the German Democratic Republic]].

==Minister of Defence==
The NVA was administered through the Ministry of National Defense, one of the principal branches of the national government. The ministers of National Defense were:

* Chief of the [[Air Forces of the National People's Army]]
* Chief of the [[Land Forces of the National People's Army]]; The Land Forces Command, located at [[Geltow]] was established on 1 December 1972 as a management body for the land forces.
* Chief of the Main Staff and secretary of the National Defense Council;
* Chief of [[Civil Defense]]; and
* Chief of [[Rear Services]].

==History==
{{main|History of the Volkspolizei}}
On January 18, 1956, the People's Chamber (the national legislature) passed a bill creating the NVA and the Ministry of Defense from the [[Chief Administration of Training]] of the [[Ministry of the Interior]]. This act formally acknowledged the existence of East Germany's armed forces. The NVA incorporated the [[Kasernierte Volkspolizei]] or KVP, Sea Police, and Air Police into a single armed force having three branches: ground, naval, and air. The Ministry of Defense was headed by Colonel General (Generaloberst) [[Willi Stoph]], who was also minister of the interior. In 1987 Stoph was chairman of the [[Government of East Germany|Council of Ministers]] and a member of the [[SED Politburo]]. General Hoffmann, who was listed as first deputy minister of defense, attended the Soviet General Staff Academy in the mid-1950s and replaced Stoph as defense minister in 1960. Hoffmann held the post until his death in 1985. Concurrent with the establishment of the NVA as a legal entity was a return to public manifestations of German military traditions, with the addition of socialist elements. The training regimen for recruits approximated that of the former Wehrmacht, as did drill and ceremonies. New uniforms, whose cut but not colour (stone grey) were far closer to those of German World War II forces than to Soviet models, were introduced. Only the helmet represented a radical departure from World War II, but here too the design differed from the Soviet model.

The creation of the NVA addressed both internal and external security problems. Internally the physical appearance of the NVA spoke to the population in terms of their traditional German heritage and differentiated the NVA from the [[Soviet Army]]. In theory at least, East German citizens could have pride in their own army. The swift creation of the NVA as a force of more than 120,000 officers and other ranks practicing Prussian-style drill was a dramatic gesture of nationalism that was impossible for the world to ignore.

The creation of the Ministry of Defense and the NVA seemingly should have been a blow to the authority and prestige of the Ministry of the Interior. The bureaucratic impact of this action was mitigated by permitting Stoph to carry both portfolios for four years. In addition, police activities, both civil and secret, remained under the Ministry of the Interior, as did the Border Police. The Ministry of the Interior established its own [[Alert police|Alert Units]] for the specific function of internal security. The Alert Units were militarily structured, fully motorized units with modern weapons and equipment. Garrisoned and trained in battalion-size units, they were capable of carrying out police tasks and other security functions. They have been used in major disturbances or in civil disasters affecting public order and safety.

Differentiation between the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior was still in progress in the 1960s. On issue in this process was the subordination of the [[Border Police]]. On September 15, 1961, by order of the National Defense Council, the entire Border Police was transferred to the NVA and redesignated the Border Troops of the NVA. Various explanations for this shift have been offered by different authorities. The official reason stressed improvement in the level of training through closer relationship with the NVA and provision for reinforcement of the Border Troops with other NVA assets. The actual reason probably had more to do with standardization within the Warsaw Pact since similar reorganizations occurred in roughly the same time period in all the non-Soviet Warsaw Pact armies.

==Organization==
The organization of the East German Ministry of Defense, which closely follows the pattern of the Soviet Ministry of Defense, comprises several administrations and departments, among which there appeared to be a certain amount of overlapping authority. The chiefs of the major administrations and commands concurrently served as deputies to the defense minister.

In the mid-1980s, its complement of about 4,200 personnel had a military-to-civilian ratio of approximately three to one, in contrast to comparable Western ministries or departments that generally have a much higher proportion of civilian employees. 

Approximately 100 Soviet liaison officers also were assigned to the East German ministry.

The Ministry of National Defense had the following subordinate executive bodies:

===Command GDR border troops===

After the subordination of the German Border Police ({{lang-de|Deutschen Grenzpolizei}}) under the Ministry of National Defense on 15 September 1961, the units were designated as the NVA (Border Troops of the NVA). Once separated, the border troops of the army units were designated as the Border Troops of the GDR ({{lang-de|Grenztruppen aus der DDR}}). The Command GDR border troops ({{lang-de|Kommando Grenztruppen der DDR}}) was based in Pätz. It was led by the Chief of the GDR border troops command ({{lang-de|Chefs des Kommandos Grenztruppen der DDR}}).

'''NHS Evidence''' is a government funded resource of information, research, evidence and best practice guidance for health, social care and public health.

It is aimed at those working in health and social care, and is designed to help students, specialists, clinicians, managers, commissioners and health providers make better and quicker evidence based decisions.
The service, which is provided by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, was set up in April 2009 as part of [[Ara Darzi, Baron Darzi of Denham|Lord Darzi's]] strategy for the future of the NHS, High Quality Care for All,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our NHS Our Future: NHS Next Stage Review Leading Local Change|publisher=Department of Health|date= May 2008 |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH}} 084644&lt;/ref&gt; which identified a clear need for better access to information in order for NHS staff to deliver the highest quality care. Further to a Freedom of Information request it was revealed that in 2009/10 it ran on a budget of £19,433,000 raising to £24,438,000 in 2010/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/budget_for_nhs_evidence|title=Budget for NHS Evidence - a Freedom of Information request to National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|date=16 March 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NHS Evidence allows users to search over 100 health and social care databases simultaneously, including [[Cochrane Library|The Cochrane Library]], [[British National Formulary]] and the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]]. It comprises an increasing number of 'specialist collections', covering a diversity of topics, from clinical areas such as 'Cancer' or 'Eyes and Vision', to issues relating to 'cross-cutting' topics relating to specific user groups, such as 'ethnicity'&lt;ref&gt;[[Ethnicity and health]]&lt;/ref&gt; with information about the particular healthcare needs of minority ethnic groups, and evidence about inequalities in health attributable to cultural, religious or 'racial' differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.nhs.uk/ethnicity|title=Ethnicity and Health|work=NICE|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216215629/http://www.library.nhs.uk/ethnicity/|archivedate=2007-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other 'crosscutting' topics include 'later life' and child health, while more specialist collections relate to differing professional or management areas of health care, such as commissioning, screening, and complementary medicines.  All of these specialist collections are led by specialists in their fields, and apply carefully agreed quality assurance controls before accessioning resources for general use.

==Resources==

Information available via NHS Evidence includes clinical and public health guidance, government policy, patient information, drug information, systematic reviews, primary research and grey literature.

There are six 'lots', or categories of data available, defined by the NICE Framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.evidence.nhs.uk/framework/nicefa/purchasing-toolkit/products-services|title=NICE Electronic &amp; Print Content Framework|publisher=NICE|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:

'''NHS Evidence – Quality and Productivity'''
helps the NHS identify efficiency savings that can be made while continuing to deliver high quality care.
Linking quality and productivity is an important challenge for the NHS if it is to reach its target of £15–20 billion in efficiency savings by 2014.
The Department of Health's Quality and Productivity project has been designed to help NHS organisations make the necessary savings without compromising quality of care and services. NHS Evidence – Quality and Productivity is part of this initiative. It gives access to evidence on how to improve quality and productivity within the NHS, including examples of innovative local practices.
Content covers best available evidence, tools and techniques, measurement, case-studies and policy on all aspects of innovation and improvement.
NHS Evidence – Quality and Productivity, provides users with real examples of how staff are improving quality and productivity
across the NHS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.nhs.uk/qualityandproductivity/|title=NHS Evidence - quality and productivity|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512180339/http://www.library.nhs.uk/qualityandproductivity/|archivedate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Lettersandcirculars/Dearcolleagueletters/DH_104239|title=Implementing the Next Stage Review visions: the quality and productivity challenge|author=Department of Health|date=13 August 2009|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Lettersandcirculars/Dearcolleagueletters/DH_104239|archivedate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NHS Evidence Accreditation'''
Organisations achieving high standards in producing guidance can be identified on NHS Evidence by a seal of approval called an Accreditation Mark.
Decisions about which organisations are awarded the Accreditation Mark are taken by an independent advisory committee and are based on rigorous analysis and assessment.
Organisations are awarded the Accreditation Mark for three years and their performance is reviewed regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evidence.nhs.uk/accreditation|title=Accreditation|work=NICE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eyes on Evidence''' is a free monthly e-bulletin which provides updates on major new evidence as it emerges with
an explanation about what it means for current practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evidence.nhs.uk/aboutus/Pages/NewsPage.aspx#bulletin|title=About us|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523165441/https://www.evidence.nhs.uk/about-us#bulletin|archivedate=2013-05-23|work=NICE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dentistry provided by the [[National Health Service]]''' (NHS) in the United Kingdom was originally intended to ensure that dental treatment is available to the whole population.  However, for dentistry it has been limited centrally for some time, struggling to even see 55% of the population in a one-year period.&lt;ref&gt;HSCIC official stats http://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/nhs-dental-statistics-for-england-2015-16-annual-report&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike medical care, charges are made to most people. In England, a new but experimental target system of UDAs was imposed by government on 1 April 2006, but by 2008 the Parliamentary Health Select Committee investigation found the UDAs were unfit for purpose.  Dentists act as private contractors to the NHS, which, simply put, means the dentists buy the building and equip the surgery, hire all the staff and pay all of the running costs including wages, materials and insurances, to provide an NHS dental service.

==Scope of the service==

According to [[NHS Choices]] "All the treatment that your dentist believes is necessary to achieve and maintain good oral health is available on the NHS. This means that the NHS provides any treatment you need to keep your mouth, teeth and gums healthy and free of pain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHS dental charges|url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/AboutNHSservices/dentists/Pages/nhs-dental-charges.aspx|publisher=NHS Choices|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes if clinically necessary: [[dentures]], crowns and bridges, orthodontistry, root canal treatment, scaling and polishing, white fillings, Implants, Emergency Dental Treatments, Children Treatments.

Many dentists who provide NHS services also offer additional services, such as hygienists, for payment. A dentist is allowed to refuse to provide treatment under the NHS and then offer to perform the same treatment privately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What can I expect from my NHS dentist?|url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/1789.aspx|publisher=NHS|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this practice is far from clear cut.

A revised contract is under discussion in 2013 with greater emphasis on oral health and quality indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Dental Practice Committee|url=https://www.bda.org/dentists/representation/gdps/gdpc/|publisher=British Dental Association|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British Dental Association is keen to see reform, having campaigned vigorously against the "flawed, target-driven arrangements" introduced in 2006 that are currently in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HSJ Live: 06.12.13 Hunt writes of 'long term challenges' in letter to NHS staff|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/hsj-live/hsj-live-061213-hunt-writes-of-long-term-challenges-in-letter-to-nhs-staff/5066191.article#.UsCLSbTYXz8|accessdate=29 December 2013|newspaper=Health Service Journal|date=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
Following the government's introduction of a new contract in April 2006, NHS dentistry is not as widely available as it once was,&lt;ref name="BBC dentist shortage"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7189448.stm | title=Dentist shortage hits 'millions' | publisher=BBC | date=2008-01-16 | accessdate=2008-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with 900,000 fewer patients seeing an NHS dentist in 2008 and 300,000 losing their NHS dentist in a single month.&lt;ref name="BBC 080605"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7438255.stm | title=NHS dental access 'falls further' | publisher=BBC | date=2008-06-05 | accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has forced many patients to pay much higher sums for private treatment,&lt;ref name="BBC dentist costs"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7251246.stm | title=NHS dentistry 'set back 20 years' | publisher=BBC | date=2008-02-19 | accessdate=2008-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been criticised by the [[British Dental Association]] as having "failed to improve access to care for patients and failed to allow dentists to provide the modern, preventive care they want to deliver".&lt;ref name="BBC 080605"/&gt;

[[Ben Bradshaw]] when Minister for Health was questioned on Radio 4 in 2007 about the shortfall in NHS dentistry leading to patients unable to access NHS dentists and even resorting to pulling their own teeth out.

In October 2018 the chairman of general dental practice at the [[British Dental Association]] claimed that there was a hostile environment for dental patients. 380,000 patients a year with dental problems were approaching [[general practitioner]]s, who were not equipped to help. Accessible public-facing information on where to seek care for dental problems was required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UK has 'hostile environment' to accessing the dentist as 380,000 people visit GP with dental problems every year, study finds |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/22/uk-has-hostile-environment-accessing-dentist-380000-people-visit/ |accessdate=23 October 2018 |publisher=Telegraph |date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charges==
Initially NHS dentistry was free at the time of use but charges to patients were introduced in 1951 and have been increased from time to time. Charges vary in different countries of the UK.

{{As of|2018|4}} there were three standard charges for all NHS dental treatments in England&lt;ref name="MyUser_Nhs.uk_6_June_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/1781.aspx?CategoryID=74 |title=How much will I pay for NHS dental treatment? - Health questions - NHS Choices |website=Nhs.uk |date=6 May 2014  |author= |accessdate= 6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wales.nhs.uk/ourservices/findannhsdentist/nhsdentalcharges |title=Health in Wales |newspaper=Wales.nhs.uk |date=  |author= |accessdate= 6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with prices having increased in England by 5% to:

* Band 1 course of treatment – £21.60 in England, £13.50 in Wales; covers an examination, diagnosis (including X-rays), advice on how to prevent future problems, a scale and polish if needed, and application of fluoride varnish or fissure sealant. Band 1 also covers emergency care such as stopping bleeding, trauma, teeth knocked out, severe pain or swelling, even if more than one visit is required.
* Band 2 course of treatment – £59.10 in England (Wales: £43.00) covers everything listed in Band 1, plus fillings, root canal work or removal of teeth.
* Band 3 course of treatment – £256.50 (Wales: £185.00) covers everything listed in Bands 1 and 2, plus crowns, dentures and bridges.

It was announced in March 2016 that charges in England would rise by 5% in April 2016 and a further 5% in April 2017. The [[British Dental Association]] complained: "This unprecedented hike in dental charges will only serve to discourage the patients that are most in need of care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dentist charges to rise 5% in England|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35786951#|accessdate=11 March 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dentists are paid in "Units of Dental Activity". Typical values for UDAs are £20-35, and they are paid 1 UDA for a band 1 course of treatment, 3 for a band 2 course of treatment, and 12 for a band 3 course of treatment. Patient charges are deducted from these values. For many treatments, the rate of pay is below the cost of providing the treatment to a modern standard, and as a result, many dentists will refer patients for any unprofitable services.

In Scotland and Northern Ireland, the system works differently and relies upon a mix of capitation payments alongside Item of Service charges. An examination in Scotland is free of charge to the patient, but pays the dentist £8.10. For most other items of treatment, the patient charge is set at 80% of the total fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psd.scot.nhs.uk/professionals/dental/Amendment-No-129.pdf|title=Statement of Dental Remuneration|website=Statement of Dental Remuneration|publisher=PSD Scotland|accessdate=2 June 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fees paid are approximately one third to one half of what they were in 1948, once adjusted for inflation.

===Exemptions===
Some groups of people are exempt for charges for dental treatment:
* children under 18, 
* people under 19 and in full-time education, 
* people who get some [[Means-tested benefit]]s, 
* women who are pregnant or have had a baby in the previous 12 months and have a valid maternity exemption certificate (MatEx) when they start a course of treatment
* People in custody
* people who have an HC2 full help certificate entitling them to free dental and other NHS treatment under the [[NHS Low Income Scheme]].
* An HC3 limited help certificate reduces payment required, without full exemption. A patient is only required to pay three times the amount their income exceeds the free treatment level. All charges paid within a three-week period are added together and count as one charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Help with dental treatment|url=http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/healthcare_e/healthcare_help_with_health_costs_e/help_with_health_costs.htm#h_help_with_dental_treatment|work=Adviceguide|publisher=Citizens Advice|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2013 to 2015, 632 patients in [[Oldham]] who were in receipt of [[Universal Credit]] and therefore entitled to free prescriptions were issued with penalty charge notices, totalling £71,000,  because the NHS forms had not been updated to reflect the introduction of Universal Credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=£71,000 in fines for free NHS treatment claims were wrongly issued|url=http://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/news-features/8/news-headlines/100083/71000-in-fines-for-free-nhs-treatment-claims-were-wrongly-issued|accessdate=2 November 2016|publisher=Oldham Chronicle|date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Patients with [[Intellectual disability|learning difficulties]] and with [[dementia]] have been issued with penalties because they made honest mistakes ticking the wrong box in complex forms.  This has caused stress for the patients and extra work for the dentists trying to sort out the problem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-41639456 'Go to the dentist and get fined £100'] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  90% of fines are overturned on appeal.  Poor people are deterred from seeking dental care that they need because they fear being fined.  Dental visits by poor people fell 23% during the four years to 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-45355527 Dentists say fines deterring poor patients] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

School dental services provided by local authorities developed slowly after 1907 when the first service of this kind was set up in Cambridge. The [[Royal Commission on the National Health Service]] in 1979 reported that local authorities had a statutory duty to make comprehensive dental treatment available to pupils since 1953, but undermanning had prevented the school dental service from delivering it. In 1968 37% of the population of England and Wales over the age of 16 had no natural teeth. In Scotland 44% of the population over 15 in 1972 had none.

There were about 14,000 general dental practitioners doing NHS work in the UK in 1977, employing about 20,000 dental surgery assistants, and 1145 dental hygienists.  46% of adults with some of their own teeth in England and Wales regularly attended a dentist in 1978 compared with 40% in 1968. In 1979 there were about 400 dental consultants in hospital services, mostly based in the 17 undergraduate dental hospitals and one post-graduate institute.&lt;ref name="HMSO"&gt;{{cite book|title=Royal Commission on the NHS Chapter 9|date=July 1979|publisher=HMSO|isbn=0101761503|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-9/|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the inception of the NHS in 1948 there were 3 branches of dental service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dentistry and National Health Service Act  A SOCIALIST MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MEMORANDUM 1947|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/dentistry-and-national-health-service-act/|publisher=Socialist Medical Association|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these 3 branches still exist today, although the organisation of services in England has changed much more than in the rest of the UK:

* A local health authority dental service which provided dental inspection and treatment to school children, pre-school children and to pregnant women and mothers of infants under one year old, but is now chiefly [[Special needs dentistry]].  These were transferred to the NHS in the 1974 reorganisation. These services employed the whole-time equivalent of about 1,980 dental officers, assisted by 370 dental auxiliaries, 2,900 dental surgery assistants, 70 hygienists and 140 dental technicians in the UK in 1977. They were repeatedly reorganised, like other community services. Most were run by [[Primary Care Trust]]s until they were abolished in April 2013.&lt;ref name="HMSO"/&gt;
* A general practitioner service.  Proposals for whole time salaried service at health centres came to nothing and almost all General Dental Practitioners are in private practice.  Contracts were originally held by [[Local Executive Council]]s, and then by their successors [[Family Practitioner Committees]],  [[Family Health Services Authority|Family Health Services Authorities]] and [[Primary Care Trust]]s.  They are now held by [[NHS England]]
* A hospital dental service, with access to specialist maxillo-facial and oral surgeons. Managed originally by Regional Health Authorities they became part of [[NHS Trust]]s, mostly in teaching hospitals.

===Contract===
The contract between the NHS and dentists determines what work is provided for under the NHS, payments to dentists, and charges to patients. The contract has been revised several times, covering more than just charges and prices. A contract introduced in 2006 was said by the British Dental Association in 2016 to be not fit for purpose, rewarding dentists for meeting government targets for treatment and repair, but not for improving patients' oral health.&lt;ref name=contract&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bda.org/contractreform |title=The NHS contract: 10 years on |website=British Dental Association|date=March 2016  |author= |accessdate= 6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==

In June 2015 The consumer group [[Which?]] contacted 500 dental surgeries listed on the official [[NHS Choices]] website and found that 31% of them were refusing to take on any new NHS patients. They called for the [[Competition and Markets Authority]] to intervene to ensure dentists were complying with rules. The [[British Dental Health Foundation]].  [[HealthWatch England]] said that in some parts of England only a fifth of surgeries were accepting new NHS patients. The chair of the [[British Dental Association]], said the “byzantine  system” had failed dentists and patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dentists say government has 'failed' NHS patients with overcomplicated regulations|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/dentists-say-government-has-failed-nhs-patients-with-overcomplicated-regulations-10322186.html|accessdate=16 June 2015|publisher=Independent|date=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BDA said that the 2006 contract did not meet its purpose of improving access to NHS dentistry and concentrating on prevention, and had been criticised by patient groups, government, the Health Select Committee and the Chief Dental Officers for England and Wales.&lt;ref name=contract/&gt;

In January 2016, more than 400 dentists signed a letter arguing that the NHS dental system in England is unfit for purpose and are whistleblowing publicly, to warn and expose the centralised failings to develop a proper national dental health and prevention strategy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/12079233/Third-World-dentistry-crisis-in-England.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Orange Alternative''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Pomarańczowa Alternatywa'') is a Polish [[anti-communist]] underground movement, started in [[Wrocław]], a city in south-west [[Poland]] and led by [[Waldemar Fydrych]] (sometimes misspelled as Frydrych), commonly known as ''Major (Commander of [[Festung Breslau]])'' in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Its main purpose was to offer a wider group of citizens an alternative way of opposition against the [[authoritarian]] regime by means of a peaceful protest that used absurd and nonsensical elements.

By doing this, members of the Orange Alternative could not be arrested by the police for opposition to the regime without the authorities becoming a laughing stock. The Orange Alternative has been viewed as part of the broader [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement. Academics Dennis Bos and Marjolein 't Hart have asserted it was the most effective of all Solidarity's factions in bringing about the movement's success.&lt;ref name="HumourandProtest"&gt;

Initially it painted ridiculous [[graffiti]] of [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]] on paint spots covering up anti-government slogans on city walls. Afterwards, beginning with 1985 through 1990, it organized a series of more than sixty happenings in several Polish cities, including Wrocław, [[Warsaw]], [[Łódź]], [[Lublin]], and [[Tomaszów Mazowiecki]].

It was the most picturesque element of Polish opposition to [[Stalinist]] [[authoritarianism]]. It suspended activity in 1989, but reactivated in 2001 and has been active on a small scale ever since.&lt;ref name="album"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Orange Alternative – Revolution of Dwarves| place = Warsaw | year =2008 | isbn = 978-83-926511-4-7 | publisher=Fundacja Pomarańczowa Alternatywa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statue of a dwarf, dedicated to the memory of the movement, stands today on [[Świdnicka Street, Wrocław|Świdnicka Street]] in Wrocław, in the place where events took place.

The Orange Alternative movement has inspired several other similar movements in authoritarian countries including [[Czechoslovakia]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and [[Hungary]] and it has also inspired and influenced the [[Pora]] and the so-called [[Orange Revolution]] movement in [[Ukraine]],{{fact|date=April 2014}} which was in turn supported by Poland.

Some utterances ascribed to Waldemar Fydrych:
:''In Poland there are only three places when you can feel free: In churches, but only for prayers; in prisons, but not everyone can go to prison; and on the streets: they are the freest places.''

:''The Western World will find out much more about the situation in Poland from hearing that I was sent to jail for handing out sanitary pads to women, than from reading books and articles written by other members of the opposition.''

:''Can you treat a police officer seriously, when he is asking you: "Why did you participate in an illegal meeting of dwarfs?"''

==Beginnings==
The beginnings of the Orange Alternative are in a student movement called the [[Movement for New Culture]] created in 1980 at the University of Wrocław. It is in that year that Waldemar "Major" Fydrych, one of the movement's founders, proclaims the [[Socialist Surrealism Manifesto]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pomaranczowa-alternatywa.org/images/manifest-eng-big.jpg Socialist Surrealism Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt; which becomes the ideological backbone behind a gazette known as "The Orange Alternative".  Seven out of the total fifteen issues of this gazette appear during student strikes organized in November and December 1980 as part of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] upheaval. The first number is edited jointly by Major Waldemar Fydrych and [[Wiesław Cupała]] (a.k.a. "Captain") simply with an idea to have fun. The editors treat the strike and the surrounding reality as forms of Art. For the ensuing numbers, the editorial committee is joined by [[Piotr Adamcio]], known as "Lieutenant Pablo", [[Andrzej Dziewit]] and [[Zenon Zegarski]], nicknamed "Lieutenant Zizi Top". Although its avantgarde character, according to the student strike organizers, was a threat to the "higher aims of the strike", and notwithstanding attempts by the strike committee to censor it, the gazette became rapidly very popular among the students.&lt;ref name="album" /&gt;

==Dwarves==
The first known actions of the Orange Alternative consisted of painting dwarf graffiti on spots created by the [[Milicja Obywatelska|police]]'s covering up anti-regime slogans on walls of the Polish cities. The first graffiti was painted by Major Waldemar Fydrych and Wiesław Cupała on the night from the 30 to 31 August 1982 on one of the residences in the Wrocław district of Biskupin and Sępolno.

Altogether more than one thousand of such graffiti were painted in the major Polish cities such as Wrocław, [[Kraków]], [[Warsaw]], [[Łódź]], and [[Gdańsk]].
Dwarves appearing in numbers all over Poland aroused the interest of both [[Poles|Polish]] pedestrians and the militia, whose intervention led to short term arrests of the graffiti artists.

During one of these incidents, Major, a detainee at a police station in Łódź, proclaimed, in reference to the [[Marxist]] and [[Hegelian]] [[dialectics]], yet another artistic manifesto and referred to his graffiti art as "[[dialectical materialism|dialectic]] painting" stating: "The Thesis is the Anti-Regime Slogan. The Anti-thesis is the Spot and the Synthesis is the Dwarf. Quantity evolves into Quality. The more Dwarves there are, the better it is."&lt;ref name="album" /&gt;

===After Revolutions of 1989===
{{Main|Revolutions of 1989}}At the beginning of the 21st century [[Wrocław's dwarfs|Dwarf figurines]] made of bronze began to appear in Wrocław. Over time, they have become a major tourist attraction in Wrocław.

==Happenings==
[[File:Pomaranczowa alternatywa-dzien wojska.jpg|thumb|Poster]]
What brought the Orange Alternative the biggest fame were its street happenings which it organized throughout the second half of the 1980s. These actions gained it enormous popularity among the Polish youth, who joined the movement, seeing it an alternative to the opposition style presented by the Solidarity, which they viewed as more stiff and boring.

The first modest happening called the "Burning of Tubes" was organized as early as 1985 in Wrocław by Major Waldemar Fydrych accompanied by a small group of artists to which belonged: [[Krzysztof Skarbek]], [[Piotr Petyszkowski]], [[Andrzej Głuszek]], and [[Sławomir Monkiewicz]].&lt;ref name="album" /&gt;

The break-through moment came in the fall of 1987, during the [[Open Theatre Festival]] in Wrocław, when the [[Village Voice]] reported the Orange Alternative's action known as "Distribution of Toilet Paper" – a happening that satirized the annoying lack of that consumer product at the time. After the publication of this article, the Orange Alternative became of interest to a number of Polish and foreign media.

The biggest happenings however took place in the years 1987 through 1989, with the "orange" wave spilling over Poland into cities such as Warsaw, Łódź, Lublin and Tomaszów Mazowiecki, following Major Fydrych's arrest on 8 March 1988.

The actions of the Orange Alternative – although its leaders and participants often expressed [[anarchistic]] viewpoints – were not inherently ideological. No serious demands were ever expressed. Rather, the slogans were surrealist in character (such as "Vivat Sorbovit", Sorbovit being a popular soft drink at that time) or "There is no freedom without dwarves". They often paraphrased slogans used by the Solidarity Union or the communists. Their role was to laugh at absurdities and pompousness of both sides of the system and provoke independent thinking.

|}

The open street formula allowed all individuals to take part in the happenings. This openness drew thousands of pedestrians to participate in the group's actions. In such a way, the majority of the happenings could assemble thousands of participants, of whom many were accidental passers-by. The culmination point in the movement's history was the action organized on 1 June 1988, known as the "Revolution of Dwarves", during which more than 10 thousand people marched through the center of Wrocław wearing orange dwarf hats.

The happenings usually terminated with the arrest of hundreds of participants, who did not manage to escape in time from the hands of the militia. At one point, the participants were even able to provoke the Communist militia to arrest 77 Santa Clauses or, on another occasion, anyone wearing anything orange.

For each of its actions, the Orange Alternative printed leaflets and posters, featuring slogans like "Every militiaman is a piece of Art" or "Citizen, help the militia, beat yourself up".&lt;ref name="album" /&gt;

The '''Paraguayan Civil War (1922)''', took place between 27 May 1922 and 10 July 1923, within the borders of [[Paraguay]]. It started when supporters of candidate [[Adolfo Chirife]] attempted to forcefully restore the implementation of presidential elections canceled by President [[Eusebio Ayala]]. Chirife represented the so-called Constitutionalist or Schaererist side ideologically supporting liberal politician [[Eduardo Schaerer]], while troops under Ayala were named Loyalists or Gondrists ideologically pledging allegiance to former President [[Manuel Gondra]]. The conflict concluded when Gondrist forces defeated the remnants of the Schaererist army in [[Asunción]].

==Background==
In the aftermath of the 1904 revolution, the Paraguayan liberal movement entered a period of instability and factional fighting. Between 1904 and 1922, 15 Paraguayan presidents assumed office. The coups of 1908 and 1910 cemented the division of Paraguayan liberals into the "radicales" and "civicos" factions. A further split of the radicales faction into two sub-factions led by [[Manuel Gondra]] and [[Eduardo Schaerer]] respectively, gradually escalated into a full-scale civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/paraguay/14.htm|title=Liberal Decades|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, Gondra came out victorious in the presidential election. Schaerer immediately attempted to undermine Gondra by forcing the resignation of Interior Minister José Guggiari, Gondra's most vocal supporter. After Gondra's refusal to dismiss Guggiari, Gondra himself resigned, due to the emergence of a split in Paraguay's armed forces. After Vice President Félix Paiva's refusal to assume office, the congress placed senator [[Eusebio Ayala]], a moderate Gondra supporter into interim presidency.&lt;ref name=Uds&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histarmar.com.ar/ArmadasExtranjeras/Paraguay/LaGuerraCivil1922-23.htm|title=La Guerra Civil Parguaya 1922–1923|author=Adrian English|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another crisis ensued when [[Adolfo Chirife]], a supporter of Schaerer, became a presidential candidate. Amassing the support of the Colorado party along with a large percentage of supporters in the Liberal Party, Chirife gathered enough support to ensure a victory in the upcoming elections. When Ayla reacted by blocking implementation of the elections, Schaerer's supporters attempted to restore the electoral process by force.&lt;ref name=kaK&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dk1868.ru/history/PARAGVAY.htm|title=В ПАРАГВАЙСКОЙ КАВАЛЕРИИ|author=Святослав Всеволодович Голубинцев |trans-title=The Paraguayan Cavalry |work=Родимый Край, issues № 121 —123|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict==
Troops belonging to the 1st, 2nd and 4th military zones totaling 1,700 men, united under the name of the Constitutional Army, declaring its loyalty to Schaerer. Opposing them, loyalist elements of the Paraguayan Navy and the wider [[Asunción]] area garrisons pledged allegiance to Gondra. On 27 May 1922, following the failure of two weeks of negotiations between the two sides, [[Adolfo Chirife]] ordered his military and civilian supporters in [[Paraguarí]] to launch an offensive on the capital, thus beginning a civil war. Passing through [[Luque]], the constitutionalists reached Asunción on June 9. By this time the Gondrists had mustered 600 regular soldiers as well as 1,000 members of the [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho syndicalist]] Marine Workers Union. Despite enjoying limited success, the Schaererists were forced to abandon the siege of the [[barricade]]d suburbs and on June 14, battles took place in [[Pirayú]] and [[Yaguarón]] as the Schaererists retreated to Paraguarí.&lt;ref name=Uds/&gt;

Between 28 and 29 June 1922, a loyalist [[Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8]] conducted two raids on Paraguarí, first dropping pamphlets and then bombing the city. On 3 July, the same F.K.8 mistakenly bombed train wagons housing imprisoned soldiers who refused to join the Constitutionalist Army. Numerous prisoners were killed or injured in the action. On 8 July 1922, the F.K.8 was shot down over Pirayú, and British pilot Sydney Stewart was killed.&lt;ref name=kaK/&gt;&lt;ref name=Uds/&gt;

In the aftermath of the July 14 loss of Pirayú and Yaguarón, Schaererists began evacuating their troops from Paraguarí to [[Villarrica, Paraguay|Villarrica]]. Between 23 and 24 July, Loyalists overran Constitutionalist positions in [[Ybitimí]] and [[Sapucaí]]. The Gondristas continued their advance, taking [[Itapé]] and [[Salitre Cué]], and finally entering Villarrica without firing a single shot on July 31. The town of [[San Estanislao]] changed hands several times as opposing cavalries skirmished in the area during early August. The Gondrista Air Force relocated to Villarrica. Reinforced with several Italian [[World War I]] veterans including ace [[Cosimo Damiano Rizzotto]], it intensified its reconnaissance and bombing missions. On 5 September, a Constitutionalist [[Ansaldo SVA]].5 bombed Salitre-Cué. A Gondrista aircraft of the same model then took off, firing at the bomber that retreated to [[Cangó]], in an engagement that is considered to be the first recorded [[dogfight]] in South America.&lt;ref name=Uds/&gt;

Fighting continued through late October and early November, as [[Isla Alta]] and [[Cangó]] fell under Gondrist control. Schaererists entrenched themselves in the Caí Puente Coronel Bogado area 30 kilometers north west of [[Encarnación, Paraguay|Encarnación]]. On 13 November, a loyalist detachment marched on Caí Puente, while a second column perpetrated a surprise attack on the Constitutionalist rearguard, capturing [[Carmen del Paraná]]. Three days later Gondrists took the Schaererirst stronghold of Caí Puente, but many Constitutionalists managed to escape detention, reorganising and moving north towards the unprotected capital. Utilizing rail transport, the Gondrists halted the Schaererist advance, and after heavy fighting in Paraguarí, [[Piribebuy]] and [[Yhú]], the defeated Gondrists fell back beyond [[Carayaó]].&lt;ref name=Uds/&gt;

On 18 March 1923, the Schaererists mounted their first attack in three months, seizing the under-protected Villarrica. The Constitutionalists then ambushed a 20-wagon supply convoy at Pañetey, killing almost 500 soldiers. On 18 May, after Schaererist commander-in-chief [[Adolfo Chirife]] died of pneumonia, newly elected commander Pedro Mendoza initiated an offensive on [[Asunción]]. Passing through the densely forested areas of [[Carapeguá]], [[Itá, Paraguay|Itá]] and [[San Lorenzo, Paraguay|San Lorenzo]], Mendoza entered the capital on 9 July 1923 without encountering significant resistance. A day later Loyalists counterattacked the capital from the north, routing the Schaererists and effectively ending the war.&lt;ref name=Uds/&gt;

The '''Pensioners' Party''' (''Partito Pensionati'', PP) is a [[centrism|centrist]] [[List of political parties in Italy|Italian political party]], whose aim is to represent the [[List of pensioners' parties|interests of pensioners]].

==History==
The Pensioners' Party was founded in 1987 in [[Milan]], and its current leader is [[Carlo Fatuzzo]].

In the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Italy)|2004 European Parliament election]], it gained 1.1% of the national vote and elected its leader to the [[European Parliament]], where he sits in the [[European People's Party–European Democrats]] group.

On 4 February 2006, the party joined [[The Union (political coalition)|The Union]], the centre-left coalition led by [[Romano Prodi]], and was decisive in the result of the [[Italian general election, 2006|2006 general election]] (the PP scored 0.9% and the centre-left won by a 0.1% margin), but soon after the election the alliance with the centre-left turned cold and tense. In the [[European Parliament]], [[Antonio Tajani]] ([[Forza Italia]], Vice President of the [[European People's Party]]), tried successfully to convince Fatuzzo to return to the centre-right coalition.

Finally, on 20 November 2006, Carlo Fatuzzo, in a press conference along with Antonio Tajani and [[Fabrizio Cicchitto]] (national deputy-coordinator of Forza Italia), announced that its party was re-joining the centre-right [[House of Freedoms]] coalition.

In the [[Italian general election, 2008|2008 general election]] the Pensioners' Party presented its candidates into [[The People of Freedom]], but it didn't gained any seat.

In the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Italy)|2009 European Parliament election]], the party ran as part of [[The Autonomy (Italy)|The Autonomy]], an electoral coalition including [[The Right (Italy)|The Right]], the [[Movement for the Autonomies]] and the [[Alliance of the Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.partitoladestra.com/?costante_pagina=polo_autonomia&amp;id_lingua=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604151622/http://www.partitoladestra.com/?costante_pagina=polo_autonomia&amp;id_lingua=2 |archivedate=2015-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irispress.it/Iris/page.asp?VisImg=S&amp;Art=33035&amp;Cat=1&amp;I=null&amp;IdTipo=0&amp;TitoloBlocco=Italia&amp;Codi_Cate_Arti=18 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006090338/http://www.irispress.it/Iris/page.asp?VisImg=S&amp;Art=33035&amp;Cat=1&amp;I=null&amp;IdTipo=0&amp;TitoloBlocco=Italia&amp;Codi_Cate_Arti=18 |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the party enters for the first time in the Italian Parliament with one deputy, [[Lino Miserotti]], who replaces the outgoing deputy [[Marco Airaghi]], and with one senator, [[Giacinto Boldrini]], who replaces the deceased senator [[Gianpiero Carlo Cantoni]].

In the [[Italian general election, 2013|2013 general election]] the Pensioners' Party ran with the [[Centre-right coalition (Italy)|Centre-right coalition]], getting only the 0.16% of the vote for the Chamber and the 0.40% for the Senate.

In the 2018 general election the party signed a cooperation Agreement with [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] and some members of the party were candidate in FI's lists, including party's secretary [[Carlo Fatuzzo]], who was elected in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]].

{{one source|date=October 2018}}

{{Userspace draft|source=ArticleWizard|date=January 2013}} 

'''Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elect. Corp.''' is a key United States legal case from 1961 in [[trademark infringement]] law. It is also cited in [[personality rights]] particularly around celebrities. The decision set out that trademark infringement is measured by the multi-factor "likelihood of confusion" test. That is, a new mark will infringe on an existing trademark if the new mark is so similar to the original that consumers are likely to confuse the two marks, and mistakenly purchase from the wrong company.&lt;ref name=polaroid&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Polaroid v. Polarad |vol=287 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=492 |pinpoint= |court=2nd Cir. |date=1961 |url=http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Polaroid+Corporation+v.+Polarad+Electronics&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,60,107,112,114,122,127,129&amp;case=2293827617926067028&amp;scilh=0 |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The likelihood of confusion test turns on several factors,&lt;ref name=polaroid /&gt; including:
* Strength of the plaintiff's trademark; 
* Degree of similarity between the two marks at issue; 
* Similarity of the goods and services at issue;
* Evidence of actual confusion; 
* Purchaser sophistication; 
* Quality of the defendant's goods or services; 
* Defendant's intent in adopting the mark:  

This multi-factor test was famously articularted by Judge [[Henry Friendly]] in Polaroid v. Polarad.&lt;ref name=polaroid /&gt; and are often referred to as the "Polaroid Factors."&lt;ref&gt;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jdlitman/classes/SI519/PFactors.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.upcounsel.com/likelihood-of-confusion-factors&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quimbee.com/keyterms/polaroid-factors&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26860">The [[use of firearms by police forces]] varies widely across the world, in part due to differences in gun use policy, civilian firearm laws, and recording of police activity. Police may require that officers use warning shots before aiming on-target, officers may need to make verbal warnings before using their firearms, and officers may be prohibited from carrying weapons while performing tasks such as highway patrol where gun use is not expected.

==Unarmed police forces==

In some countries including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], and [[New Zealand]] police do not carry firearms unless the situation is expected to involve gunfire from the opposing force. A survey conducted in the United Kingdom in 2004 found that 47% of citizens supported arming all police while 48% were opposed to the idea.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19641398|publisher=BBC|title=Why British police don't have guns|access-date=11 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==

The [[Law enforcement in Australia|Australian police forces]] is monitored by the [[Australian Institute of Criminology]], which has recorded police shooting deaths since 1989. Police in Australia routinely wear firearms which are personally issued to them. All fatal police shootings are subject to a mandatory coronial inquest. A 2013 review by the Australian Institute of Criminology found that 42% of victims of fatal police shootings had a mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/rip/rip34/rip34.pdf#page=2|publisher=Australian Institute of Criminology |title=Research in Practice: Police shootings of people with a mental illness |access-date=9 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent history of deaths by police shootings is tabulated below.

==Denmark==

Since 1965 all Danish police officers have carried a police pistol when performing their duties. [[Danish police]] used [[Walther PPK]] 7.65&amp;nbsp;mm as the standard pistol until 2000, and then the [[Heckler &amp; Koch USP]] 9&amp;nbsp;mm was introduced. In 2008 police began to carry [[pepper spray]] in addition to their firearm.

The appropriate use of firearms is described in the ''Act on Police Activities'' regulations, section 16 and 17 is translated into English in.&lt;ref name=DEN2007&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politi.dk/NR/rdonlyres/20DE43AF-33F4-48C5-A710-6A58457E35D2/0/Engelskresum%C3%A9afendeligrapport.pdf|publisher=Politiet  |title=THE USE OF POLICE FIREARMS IN DENMARK |access-date=8 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote |text=16. (1) The police may use force only if necessary and justified and only by such means and to such extent as are reasonable relative to the interest which the police seek to protect. Any assessment of the justifiability of such force must also take into account whether the use of force involves any risk of bodily harm to third parties.

(2) Force must be used as considerately as possible under the circumstances and so as to minimise any bodily harm.

17. (1) Firearms may only be used:
 (i) to avert an on-going or imminent dangerous assault on a person;
 (ii) to avert other imminent danger to the lives of persons or of such persons incurring grievous bodily harm […]
 (iv) to secure the apprehension of persons who have or are suspected on reasonable grounds of having commenced or committed a dangerous assault on another person unless the risk that such persons will commit another such assault is deemed not to exist;

(2) Before the police fire shots involving a risk of harm to a person, the person must be informed in so far as possible, first by shouted warnings and then by warning shots, that the police intend to fire if police orders are not observed. It must also be ensured, in so far as possible, that the person is able to observe the order.

(3) In case of an obvious risk of hitting third parties, shots may only be fired as a last resort […]

(5) If police shooting has caused harm to a person, the person must immediately be examined by a doctor. 
 }}

In Denmark the police use of weapons is recorded by the police department. The police department classifies tear gas as the use of a firearm. In 2006 the death of four people by police shootings prompted an investigation into the use of firearms by the Danish police force from 1996 to 2006. The investigation found no significant trends of increased firearms use by the police.&lt;ref name=DEN2007 /&gt;

==New Zealand==
The [[New Zealand Police]] do not routinely carry firearms. When force is used (excluding handcuffs) a tactical operations report is filed. Use of tactical options is published by the police force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publication/tactical-options-research-reports |title=Tactical Options Research Reports |publisher=New Zealand Police Response and Operations: Research and Evaluation |access-date=8 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A summary of tactical options used in 2010–2014 was published in 2015. In 33,198 events over the four-year period, firearms were drawn 1,422 times, resulting in 5 injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.police.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/summary-taser-tor-data-mar2010-dec2014.pdf |title=TASER/Tactical Options Reporting (TOR) data from 22 March 2010 to 31 December 20141 |publisher=New Zealand Police Response and Operations: Research and Evaluation |access-date=8 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tactical operations resulting in fatalities are not recorded in the database.

Since 1916, [[New Zealand Police]] have used lethal force 40 times.

==Norway==

The [[Norwegian Police Service]] only carry firearms in response to specific situations.

==South Africa==
The [[South African Police Service]] is monitored by the [[Independent Police Investigative Directorate|Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID)]] which releases an annual report on the performance indicators of police activity. The IPID publishes deaths as a results of police action and deaths in police custody. Use of firearms forms the majority of the killings by police; shootings by police are all classified under ''deaths as a result of police action''.

==United Kingdom==
{{main|Police use of firearms in the United Kingdom}}
The police forces in the United Kingdom are managed by different bodies and as such they have different standards for firearms usage. Police in Northern Ireland regularly carry firearms whereas the police in Scotland, England and Wales do not.

===England and Wales===

The police force in England and Wales do not routinely carry firearms, a 2006 poll of 47,328 members of the Police Federation of England and Wales found that 82% do not want officers to be routinely armed while on duty.&lt;ref name=BBC1 /&gt; The UK home office reports annual statistics on the use of firearms by police forces. The use of firearms is recorded by the police department which publishes detailed statistics on the annual use of firearms dating back to 2003. One report published figures for 2003-2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/298435/Police_use_of_firearms_Commons.pdf|publisher=UK Home Office|title=Statistics on police use of firearms in England and Wales 2012-13|access-date=8 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; later years are published individually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/police-use-of-firearms-statistics|publisher=UK Home Office|title=Police use of firearms statistics|access-date=8 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Home Office monitors the use of police equipment the Independent Police Complaints Commission monitors the fatalities of people due to police contact.

==United States==
There is no consistent recording of firearms use across all states, some bodies such as the [[New York Police Department]] (NYPD) report on firearms discharge. In 2015 NYPD reported a record low of eight deaths as well as fifteen injuries caused by police firearms discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/analysis_and_planning/nypd_annual_firearms_discharge_report_2015V3.pdf#page=41 |title=Annual firearms discharge report |publisher=New York Police Department|access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] publish the number of justified homicides by law enforcement.

In response to the lack of published data, British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' launched ''The Counted''- a program to record the number of fatal police shootings throughout the United States. ''The Guardian'' reports that 1146 people were killed in 2015 and 1092 people in 2016.

'''Renewing the Anarchist Tradition''' is an annual [[wikt:conference|conference]] of [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[intellectuals]]. Started in 1997, it has brought together anarchists and anti-authoritarian scholars and activists desiring to critically engage both with the tradition itself and the world at large. Participants and presenters at the conference aim to foster a more rigorous contemporary theoretical framework for anarchism as well as a stronger foundation from which anti-authoritarian movements can organize and resist. The conference is co-organized by  [[Institute for Anarchist Studies]] members Andrea Maria, Cindy Milstein and John Petrovato. The 2007 conference was held in [[Montpelier, Vermont]].&lt;ref name=mckay&gt;

{{quote|In a historical moment characterized overwhelmingly by war, exploitation, forced displacement, dispossession, and environmental devastation, it might seem strange to spend a peaceful fall weekend in conversation with friends and comrades in Vermont. But we believe that the contemporary context makes it more important than ever to foster a space in which to collectively and honestly appraise the strengths as well as weaknesses of different anarchist practices, platforms, convictions, dogmas, truisms, and theories in helping us to understand and ultimately transform the layered systems of domination and oppression that structure it. We also see RAT as a place to discuss and share theoretical tools from beyond the anarchist tradition(s) that can add to building more sustainable social movements and practices, and eventually a world characterized by freedom, justice, and dignity for all.&lt;ref name=ias&gt;{{cite web

The conference intends to support and nurture "a new generation of [[anti-authoritarian]] [[public intellectual]]s" from varied backgrounds and experiences.&lt;ref name=ias/&gt; The conference is self-described as "a scholarly conference," in virtue of the claimed quality of the presentations and discussions rather than the professional identity of the participants, and being active in academia is not a requirement for participation, though notable radical academics are presenters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weikert |first=Will |year=2006 |title=Critical Multitude, War Machine: What the Left Can Learn, and the Right May Have Already Learned, From a Bunch of Bicyclists |journal=Situations: Project of the Radical Imagination |volume=1 |issue=2 |url=http://ojs.gc.cuny.edu/index.php/situations/article/view/36/23 |accessdate=2008-03-09 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The conference has served as a fertile environment for organizers, scholars, writers, artists, educators, publishers, and students from a diversity of  [[left libertarian]] and [[anarchist schools of thought|anarchist tendencies]] to collaborate and develop long-term relationships.

Presentations at the conference have focused on topics ranging from the nature of social change and the changing nature of [[State (polity)|state]], [[technology]] and [[Capital (economics)|capital]] to anarchists' position in relation to the geopolitics of war and terrorism; from emergent forms of both domination and resistance in a globalizing world to the role and possibilities of [[anarchism and the arts|anti-authoritarian art]] and [[propaganda]]; and from the persistent importance of concepts such as [[Social class|class]], community, and labor, to the challenges for anarchists of confronting issues of [[identity politics|identity]] such as gender, race and sexuality.&lt;ref name=ias/&gt;

'''Rural Reconstruction Nepal (RRN)''' ({{lang-ne|नेपाल ग्रामीण पुनर्निर्माण संस्था}}) is a non-government, not for profit, social development organisation in Nepal, initiated in 1989 in the form of a small organisation created by a group of creative graduates of the [[Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science]] in Chitwan district with its initial name 'Grass Roots Institute for Training and Services-Nepal (GRITS-Nepal)'. By subscribing to the basic principles of the International Rural Reconstruction Movement, GRITS-Nepal was renamed and officially registered in 1993 as Rural Reconstruction Nepal (RRN). With the passage of time, RRN has been able to expand itself into one of the fast-growing NGOs in the country together with its diverse development programmes covering the vast geographical area and the population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rrn.org.np/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=56&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; 

RRN enjoys the Special Consultative Status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) of the United Nations since 1997 and is also accredited to the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), and the [[Green Climate Fund]] (GCF). Currently, it is hosting the Sub-Regional Secretariat of the CSO Partnership for Development Effectiveness (CPDE)[http://www.csopartnership.org], the Regional Secretariat of the South Asia Alliance for Poverty Eradication (SAAPE) [http://www.saape.org.org], and the International Secretariat of LDC Watch [http://www.ldcwatch.org]. 

Remaining within the centre of Credo of the International [[Rural Reconstruction Movement]], RRN has been working with the poverty trodden and disadvantaged rural communities for more than one and half decade. During this period, based on the four-fold approach of rural reconstruction - education, health, livelihood and self-government, it has implemented a wide range of community development programmes and projects to address the crucial problems of the country and the people. These programmes include education, healthcare, natural resource management for livelihood, empowerment of women, children and the Dalit, and ethnic minority groups. Besides, it has also implemented activities that produced positive results in the community within a short period, particularly at the time of disasters and conflicts. Such activities included the emergency relief and rehabilitation, rural infrastructure development, life skill development, and local resource generation programmes, among others.

Since its inception, RRN has been working with the poor and marginalised people in rural Nepal to facilitate them in the process of meeting their basic needs, improving livelihoods and building their own institutions. It contributes to rural people's empowerment and socio-economic reconstruction process, by embracing the rights-based approaches to development.  RRN is also committed to creating an enabling environment for building a just, equitable, peaceful and prosperous society through social, economic and political empowerment of the rural poor, particularly the poor rural women, peasants, landless people and other disadvantaged and socially oppressed strata of Nepalese society. 

Besides implementing integrated community development programmes at grassroots, it is also engaged in advocacy, lobbying and networking at local, national and international levels for the cause of protecting and promoting human rights and social justice. 

In the post conflict context of [[Nepal]], RRN has positioned itself to facilitate in conflict transformation initiatives by adopting the approach that strongly focuses on institutionalising democracy and peace building through reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation - RRR process. In order to successfully embark on such a significant process, RRN considers such key aspects - people's genuine participation, gender equality and social inclusion, transparency, accountability, social justice, coordination and collaboration, and community's demand, community ownership over the interventions and sustainability as its strategies. 

==Core Beliefs==
*	The rural poor in Nepal, as elsewhere in the world, are confronted by four basic and interrelated problems: poverty, ignorance, disease and civic inertia.
*	Because the rural poor comprise two thirds of the world's population in the developing world; hence, social peace is likely to always remain as an unattainable dream unless these rural poor are able to solve their basic problems and achieve a standard of living equal to that of the rest of the society.
*	The rural poor have the potential power for self-development, what they lack is the opportunity to release and develop this power.
*	The rural poor also have personal dignity and should be regarded with respect, not pity.

==Four Fold Approach==
RRN focuses all its development programmes on the four-fold approach of Rural Reconstruction as the foundation upon which its programme and project activities are based. The focus lies on the following four key building blocks:
*	'''Education and awareness''' - to combat illiteracy, and provide exposure to the outside world
*	'''Livelihood''' - to fight poverty and hunger
*	'''Health''' - to prevent disease, and promote rights to health
*	'''Self-Government''' - to overcome

==RRN's Credo==

RRN subscribes to the philosophy and principles of the International Rural Reconstruction Movement, which are encapsulated in the following credo:
*	Go to the people
*	Live among them
*	Learn from them
*	Plan with them
*	Work with them
*	Start with what they know
*	Build on what they have
*	Teach by showing
*	Learn by doing
*	Not a showcase but a pattern
*	Not odds and ends but a system
*	Not piecemeal but an integrated approach
*	Not to conform but to transform
*	Not relief but release

==RRN's Working Districts==

RRN is implementing diverse community development programmes and projects in several districts of the country; covering the Mountain, Hills and Lowlands (Tarai) ecological zones. It is estimated that these programmes have benefited over 500,000 households.

== History ==

Security First Corp was founded in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=59675647 |title=Company Overview of Security First Corp. |publisher=bloomberg.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Mark O'Hare, a 26-year navy veteran&lt;ref name=loyalty360&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loyalty360.org/Content-Gallery/Daily-News/Security-First-Corp-Aims-to-Eliminate-Customer-Dat |title=Security First Corp. Aims to Eliminate Customer Data Risk |publisher=loyalty360.com |date=2014-10-20 |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had served as Program Executive Officer of the US Navy Aircraft Carrier Program.&lt;ref name = "cioreview2"/&gt;

In 2008, information technology company [[Unisys]] integrated Security First's Secure Parser technology into its Stealth brand software for Windows servers and desktops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techworld.com/news/apps/windows-workgroups-get-encrypted-sessions-107917/ |title=Windows workgroups get encrypted sessions|publisher=techworld.com |date=2008-12-03 |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, the company acquired Silicon Valley-based DRC Computer Corporation (DRC), a developer of acceleration [[coprocessor]]s.  Security First was reportedly using DRC's products for an information security appliance, and planned to operate DRC as a wholly owned subsidiary.&lt;ref name="socaltech.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socaltech.com/security_first_acquires_coprocessor_firm/s-0022074.html |title=Security First Acquires Coprocessor Firm|publisher=socaltech.com |date=2009-06-08 |accessdate=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, [[IBM]] announced they were integrating three of Security First's cryptographic technologies into its next generation of chips, to increase their security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-seeks-cloud-encryption-with-security-first-tie-up/ |title=IBM seeks cloud encryption with Security First tie-up|publisher=zdnet.com |date=2011-08-01 |accessdate=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, Security First released SPxSHARC for [[VMware]]'s vCenter Server, running on VMWare's ESXi [[hypervisor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cloudstrategymag.com/articles/85412-security-first-corp-releases-spxsharc-for-vmware-vcenter-server |title=IBM seeks cloud encryption with Security First tie-up|publisher=cloudstrategymag.com |date=2014-12-17 |accessdate=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, IBM announced it was using Security First's SPxBitFiler-IPS encryption technology to allow IBM's [[PureSystems#PureApplication|PureApplication System]] virtual pattern deployers to encrypt on-disk data.  The technology is also licensed by IBM for its Cloud Data Encryption Service (ICDES).&lt;ref name = "cioreview1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www-01.ibm.com/software/brandcatalog/puresystems/centre/details?uid=PPA_D10N0LLN  |title=IBM Encryption Pattern for Security First SPxBitFiler-IPA|publisher=ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
Security First's core product is Secure Parser Extended (SPx) technology, which encrypts data, scrambles it randomly and disperses it to different locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/4131431007001/staying-at-the-forefront-of-cybersecurity-/?%23sp=show-clips#sp=show-clips  |title=Staying at the forefront of cybersecurity |publisher=foxbusiness.com |date=2015-03-24 |accessdate=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The technology combines [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES-256]] certified encryption, [[multi-factor authentication|multi-factor]] secret sharing with keyed information dispersal, and cryptographic random bit-splitting.  The solution is compliant with common government and industry data protection standards and security requirements.&lt;ref name = "loyalty360"/&gt;

The company offers SPx SHARC, a security suite designed for multi-site data protection, SPx Gateway, a data protection solution designed to protect data stored across multiple [[cloud computing]] service providers, a process the company calls "Cloud Spanning",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://security.cioreview.com/vendor/2016/security_first_corp. |title=Security First Corp: SPx Technology: Advanced Data Security Assured|publisher=cioreview.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ParsedCloud, a file transfer application that encrypts, splits and transfers data between multiple sites, available in free and fee-based versions.&lt;ref name = "cioreview2"/&gt;

The '''shooting of Antonio Martin''' occurred on December 23, 2014, in [[Berkeley, Missouri]], a suburb of St. Louis. Martin, an 18-year-old black male, was fatally shot by a white Berkeley police officer when Martin pulled a gun on him. The shooting sparked protests in the St. Louis area and other cities in the U.S. The shooting elicited comparison to the earlier [[Shooting of Michael Brown|shooting death of Michael Brown]] two miles away in [[Ferguson, Missouri]].

==Incident==
[[File:Antonio Martin.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Antonio Martin]]
On the night of December 23, 2014, a Berkeley Police Department officer responded to an employee's emergency phone call report at 11:11&amp;nbsp;pm of shoplifting by two men at a Mobil [[On the Run (convenience store)|On the Run]] convenience store along the 6800 block of North Hanley Road.&lt;ref name="300 protesters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WP covered" /&gt; An unidentified officer arrived at 11:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. in his police cruiser and saw two men just outside the store who matched the description of the suspects.&lt;ref name="300 protesters" /&gt;

The shooting happened in a parking lot outside a Mobil gas station. The police officer was not wearing a body camera and there were no shots fired by the teen's gun.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/30/antonio-martin-police-shooting-missouri&lt;/ref&gt; As the officer fired, he stumbled backwards and fell to the ground while retreating, all of which was caught on video by the store's security cameras.&lt;ref name="300 protesters"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Byers|first1=Christine|title=St. Louis region on edge in wake of fatal police shooting in Berkeley|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/region-on-edge-in-wake-of-fatal-police-shooting-in/article_3ff750c3-aa53-53eb-bad2-049acd33e83c.html|accessdate=25 December 2014|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaken /&gt; One of the shots fired by the officer struck Martin, another struck the tire of the officer's vehicle, and the third is unaccounted for.&lt;ref name=Shaken&gt;{{cite news|last1=Byers|first1=Christine|title=Attorney: Berkeley officer 'shaken' by fatal shooting|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/attorney-berkeley-officer-shaken-by-fatal-shooting/article_90e31a8c-11b0-55a4-bb3a-56b4700480de.html|accessdate=25 December 2014|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence ==
Police recovered a [[Hi-Point Firearms|Hi-Point]] [[9 mm caliber|9mm]] handgun from the scene, said to be Martin's, with five rounds in the magazine and one round in the chamber.&lt;ref name="never fired"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Deere|first1=Stephen|title=Berkeley officials: Man killed by police had pointed gun at officer|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/berkeley-officials-man-killed-by-police-had-pointed-gun-at/article_5027be1d-c99e-5cb9-9c1a-04ca73316591.html|accessdate=31 December 2014|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=31 December 2014|quote=Martin never fired the weapon, a Hi-Point 9 mm semi-automatic pistol found near him, police said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gun's serial number had been filed off, an indication that it may have been stolen.&lt;ref name="Day-after protests" /&gt;

Footage of the incident was captured by surveillance cameras outside the convenience store.&lt;ref name="300 protesters" /&gt; According to police, several witness' accounts back up the officer's story that Martin was first to draw his weapon.&lt;ref name="WP covered" /&gt; The officer said he was not wearing the [[body camera]] he had been issued earlier that day. The police car's [[dash-camera]] was likely not recording at the time.&lt;ref name="Day-after protests" /&gt;

== Investigation ==
The officer is identified as a 34-year-old white male, and a six-year veteran of the department.&lt;ref name=Shaken /&gt; He had previously Served with the Country Club Hills, Missouri Police Department.&lt;ref name="300 protesters" /&gt; He is represented by attorney Brian Millikan who also represents St. Louis police officer Jason Flanery in the October [[2014 Ferguson unrest#Vonderrit Myers Jr.|killing of VonDeritt Myers]].&lt;ref name=Shaken /&gt;

St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney [[Robert P. McCulloch (prosecutor)|Robert McCulloch]] assigned a prosecutor to the County's investigation. The City of Berkeley will conduct its own independent investigation.&lt;ref name="300 protesters" /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Vigilers outside Cathedral Basilica.JPG|thumb|Vigilers outside the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis|Cathedral Basilica]]]]
Despite complaints about the timeliness of medical attention to arrive, paramedics arrived at 11:21&amp;nbsp;p.m. – six minutes after the shooting. Martin was declared dead, and his body covered, by 11:28&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="WP covered"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lowery|first1=Wesley|title=Police: Multiple witnesses say Antonio Martin pulled gun on officer|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/12/30/police-multiple-witnesses-say-antonio-martin-pulled-gun-on-officer/|accessdate=26 April 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=30 December 2014|quote=However, city officials insisted that paramedics arrived at the scene of the shooting at 11:21 p.m. – approximately six minutes after the shooting – and had declared Martin dead, covering his body, by 11:28 p.m.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A crowd of onlookers and protesters gathered at the scene within 20 minutes of the shooting.&lt;ref name="300 protesters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WP covered" /&gt; The county crimes against persons unit arrived at 12:15&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name="Day-after protests" /&gt; As the crowd grew angry, protesters clashed with law enforcement working to protect the scene for investigators collecting evidence. The crowd grew to an estimated 300 people as tensions escalated. Some threw rocks and other projectiles at the officers.&lt;ref name="300 protesters" /&gt; One officer received a facial laceration from a thrown brick.&lt;ref name="Day-after protests" /&gt; Another officer's leg was injured when two explosive devices were ignited at the gas station. Protesters damaged police cars and another explosive ignited a small fire at a nearby [[QuikTrip]].&lt;ref name="300 protesters" /&gt;

Media crews and surveillance video recorded an individual lighting fires with lighter fluid inside and outside the same store when looters broke in. Police say 19-year-old Joshua Williams of St. Louis was the individual. Williams, a frequently quoted advocate for peace in the aftermath of the [[Michael Brown shooting]], was charged days later with arson in the first degree, a felony; felony burglary and misdemeanor stealing. On video Williams confessed to police of lighting the fires.&lt;ref name="Peace advocate"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Christine Byers|author2=Michele Munz|title=Protester who advocates peace charged with setting fire at Berkeley QT|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/protester-who-advocates-peace-charged-with-setting-fire-at-berkeley/article_ad4006c5-06ab-5b7e-8a7f-3fd2ed4dbbcb.html|accessdate=28 December 2014|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=28 December 2014|quote=St. Louis County police arrested Joshua Williams, 19, of St. Louis, on Friday after several local media outlets and store surveillance captured images of him trying to set a pile of wood on fire outside the QuikTrip on North Hanley Road early Wednesday.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four others were arrested for assault-related offenses. Martin's body was removed from the crime scene at around 1:40&amp;nbsp;a.m. Several protesters lingered at the site throughout the night.&lt;ref name="300 protesters" /&gt;

[[File:Riot control outside Cathedral Basilica.JPG|thumb|Riot police outside the Cathedral Basilica]]
Police were seeking the unidentified second suspect who fled the scene as a "[[person of interest]]".&lt;ref name="Second man"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Mitch Smith|author2=Monica Davey|title=Cautions Against Ferguson Comparisons After Officer Kills Black Teenager|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/25/us/berkeley-missouri-police-shooting.html|accessdate=27 December 2014|work=New York Times|date=24 December 2014|quote=The second man in the images fled, the police said, and was being sought on Wednesday.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other bystanders at the scene were identified as witnesses. Martin's girlfriend was among those at the scene at the time of the shooting.&lt;ref name="Day-after protests" /&gt;

The night after the incident, dozens of people, including Martin's mother and stepfather, gathered near the scene where Martin was killed to chant and protest. Some in the group broke away to block traffic on the nearby [[Interstate 170]]. Law enforcement attempted to subdue the protesters with [[pepper spray]].&lt;ref name="Day-after protests"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Staff|title=Protesters confront police at site where Berkeley officer killed suspect who pulled gun|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/protesters-confront-police-at-site-where-berkeley-officer-killed-suspect/article_d45db16a-7422-5307-b81d-b45dbdc896ba.html|accessdate=25 December 2014|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least two were arrested.&lt;ref name="300 protesters" /&gt;

A '''state crown''' is the working [[crown (headgear)|crown]] worn or used by a [[monarch]] on recurring state occasions such as when [[State Opening of Parliament|opening Parliament]] in Britain, as opposed to the [[coronation crown]] with which they would be formally crowned.

Some state crowns might however be used during parts of the [[coronation]] ceremony. In isolated cases, individual monarchs sometimes chose to use their state crown instead of the official [[coronation crown]] for the crowning, but those cases were exceptions rather than the norm.

Some states where there was no ceremonial coronation only had state crowns, or neither as in Belgium.

The term ''state crown'' was particularly used in the [[Kingdom of England]] and its successor [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] to describe the crowns of Kings [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] that were worn on occasions such as the [[State Opening of Parliament]]. While the crown of Charles no longer exists, the [[Gemstone|jewel]]-less frame of the [[State Crown of George I]] is still kept among the [[British Crown Jewels]].
Because they were more frequently in use, in contrast to a coronation crown which was usually only worn once during each reign, state crowns were repeatedly replaced due to wear and tear. 

Because of its age and fragility, the State Crown of George I was replaced in 1838,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Charles Fox Davies  | first = Arthur  |author2=Graham Johnston  | title = A Complete Guide to Heraldry | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | year = 2004 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0EBiwcy4x5EC&amp;pg=PA359&amp;dq=%22State+crown%22+opening&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=9wIf3LqrnJi_O4wWn3U-p1lMsz8#PPA359,M1 | isbn = 1-4179-0630-8 | page = 359}}&lt;/ref&gt; the new replacement crown was instead called the [[Imperial State Crown]], as was its replacement in 1937. The adjective 'imperial' did not indicate that British Sovereigns were Emperors, even if ''rex in regno suo est imperator'' (tbe King is Emperor within his own realm), but in medieval European tradition crowns with arches were called Imperial.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16577">In [[public policy]], a '''sunset provision''' or '''clause''' is a measure within a [[statute]], [[regulation]] or other law that provides that the law shall cease to have effect after a specific date, unless further [[legislative]] action is taken to extend the law. Most laws do not have sunset clauses and therefore remain in force indefinitely, except under systems in which [[desuetude]] applies.

==Origin==
The roots of sunset provisions are laid in [[Roman law]] of the [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] but the first philosophical reference is traced in the laws of Plato &lt;ref&gt;Antonios Kouroutakis, "The Constitutional Value of Sunset Clauses" Routledge 2017&lt;/ref&gt;. At the time of the [[Roman Republic]], the empowerment of the [[Roman Senate]] to collect special taxes and to activate troops was limited in time and extent. Those empowerments ended before the expiration of an electoral office, such as the [[Proconsul]]. The rule ''Ad tempus concessa post tempus censetur  denegata'' is translated as "what is admitted for a period will be refused after the period". The same rules were applied in the Roman emergency legislation. The fundamental principle appeared in several areas of legislation and later codified in the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex Iustinianus]]'' (10, 61, 1). The principle was broken when [[Julius Caesar]] became dictator for life.

==Examples==
Sunset provisions have been used extensively throughout legal history &lt;ref&gt;Antonios Kouroutakis, "The Constitutional Value of Sunset Clauses" Routledge 2017&lt;/ref&gt;. The idea of general sunset provisions was discussed extensively in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Charnovitz, "Evaluating Sunset: What Would It Mean?", in Contemporary Public Budgeting (edited by Thomas Lynch), Washington DC: Transaction Books, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

====Federal level====
In American federal law parlance, legislation that renews an expired mandate is a ''reauthorization act'' or ''extension act''. Extensive political wrangling often precedes reauthorizations of controversial laws or agencies. High-profile examples in [[American law]] include:

=====Sedition Act of 1798=====
Part of the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], the Sedition Act was a political tool used by [[John Adams]] and the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] to suppress opposition. The authors ensured the act would terminate at the end of Adams' term so that it could not be used by [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]] against his own party.

=====USA PATRIOT Act=====
Under §224 of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], several of the surveillance portions originally expired on December 31, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/34499.pdf USA PATRIOT Act Sunset: Provisions that Expire on December 31, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; These were later renewed, but expired again on March 10, 2006, and were renewed once more in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Farrell|first=Michael B.|title=Obama signs Patriot Act extension without reforms|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0301/Obama-signs-Patriot-Act-extension-without-reforms|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The USA PATRIOT Act is set to sunset the following provisions:
* §201 [[Telephone tapping|Wiretap]]ping for [[terrorism]] cases
* §202 Wiretapping for [[computer fraud]] and abuse
* §203(b) and (d) Sharing of wiretap and [[foreign intelligence]] information
* §§204, 206, 207, 214, 215, 218, and 225 [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] related sections including roving wiretaps
* §209 Warranted seizure of [[voicemail]] messages
* §217 Computer trespasser communications
* §220 Nationwide service or warrants for electronic evidence
* §223 [[Privacy]] violation [[civil liability]]

=====Assault Weapons Ban=====
In 2004 the sunset provision of the [[Assault Weapons Ban]] terminated the law.

=====Budget Act and the Byrd Rule=====
{{further information|Reconciliation (United States Congress)}}

The [[Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974|Congressional Budget Act]] governs the role of Congress in the budget process.  Among other provisions, it affects Senate rules of debate during the budget reconciliation, not least by preventing the use of the [[filibuster]] against the budget resolutions.  The Byrd rule, named after its principal sponsor, [[Robert C. Byrd|Senator Robert C. Byrd]], was adopted in 1985 and amended in 1990 to modify the Budget Act and is contained in section 313.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rules.house.gov/Archives/RL30862.pdf The Budget Reconciliation Process: The Senate's "Byrd Rule"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202021810/http://www.rules.house.gov/archives/RL30862.pdf |date=2010-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule allows Senators to raise a point of order against any provision that is extraneous, where extraneous is defined according to one of several criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rules.house.gov/archives/byrd_rule.htm Summary Of The Byrd Rule&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205015541/http://www.rules.house.gov/archives/byrd_rule.htm |date=2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of extraneous includes provisions that are outside the jurisdiction of the committee or that do not affect revenues nor outlays.

Importantly for sunset provisions, the Byrd Rule also defines as extraneous provisions that "...would increase the deficit for a fiscal year beyond those covered by the reconciliation measure."  Since the Budget Act says the budget resolution covers at least the four years following the ''budget year,'' which is typically the year following the year it was adopted, that is the usual period of time. However, budget resolutions have covered periods as long as ten years, so a reconciliation measure may cover the ten years. This rule has the effect of allowing congress members to raise a point of order against any spending increase or tax cut that does not contain a sunset provision that ends it after five or ten years (conceivably longer).  (Otherwise, the provision increases the deficit in a fiscal year after the period covered by the budget resolution.)  Overcoming a point of order requires [[cloture]], and thus a three-fifths majority of 60 in the Senate.  In short, a net effect of the Byrd Rule is to require that any spending increase or tax cut be approved by a majority of 60 if it does not contain a sunset provision. This is intended to assure there is no increase in the deficit after the budget resolution period (though there is an exception if the total effect on the deficit in a particular title is to not increase the deficit, the point of order is not triggered).  With the sunset provision, only a simple majority is necessary in the budget reconciliation process.

=====Estate tax and other tax cuts of 2001=====
In the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]] the US Congress enacted a phaseout of the federal [[estate tax]] over the following 10 years, so that the tax would be completely repealed in 2010. However, while a majority of the Senate favored the repeal, there was not a three-fifths supermajority in favor. Therefore, a sunset provision in the Act reinstates the tax to its original levels (and indeed, all tax cuts contained in the Act) on January 1, 2011 in order to comply with the [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)#Byrd_Rule|Byrd Rule]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=396740 SSRN-The Budget Process and the 'Sunset' Provision of the 2001 Tax Law by Michael Evans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011|4}}, Republicans in Congress have tried to repeal the sunset provision, but their efforts have been unsuccessful. Uncertainty over the prolonged existence of the sunset provision has made [[estate planning]] more complicated. However, certain provisions of the Act have had their sunset provision repealed.  For example, the education savings [[529 plan]]s, also introduced in the Act, were permanently extended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://flagship.vanguard.com/VGApp/hnw/VanguardViewsArticle?ArticleJSP=/freshness/News_and_Views/news_ALL_chaircorner3Q06_10042006_ALL.jsp Vanguard − Chairman's Corner: A look at the year's sleeper hit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====State level====
According to the [[National Conference of State Legislatures]], "Colorado, Florida and Alabama passed the first sunset laws in 1976. Texas and 21 other states followed suit in 1977. Eventually, a total of 36 states passed broad sunset statutes"; however, dissatisfaction with the sunset process left only 22 states still using it by 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Is+the+sun+setting+on+the+Texas+sunset+law%3f-a015443787 McNeely, Dave. "Is the sun setting on the Texas sunset law?" The Free Library, 1 May 1994], accessed 19 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Texas=====
The Texas Sunset provision was established in 1977. Under Texas law, all agencies – except universities, courts, and agencies established by the [[Texas Constitution]] – will be abolished on a specific date, generally 12 years after creation or renewal, unless the [[Texas Legislature]] passes specific legislation to continue its functions.

A 12-member [[Sunset Advisory Commission]] oversees the provisions of the Texas Sunset Act.  The commission consisting of five members of the [[Texas Senate]] and one member from the general public appointed by the [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas]], and five members of the House and one member from the general public appointed by the Speaker of the [[Texas House of Representatives]]. Legislative members are appointed for four-year terms, with half of the commission reappointed on or before September 1 of odd-numbered years, while public members serve two-year terms. The chairman and vice-chairman are appointed by the lieutenant governor and speaker, and the chairmanship alternates between the Senate and House every two years. The Commission is assisted by an executive director and staff, who review each agency subject to sunset provisions.

Under the process, each agency must perform for the commission a self-review of its roles and responsibilities, including areas where its duties may overlap those of other agencies and the effect of the agency's abolition on loss of federal funding. The self-review must be completed by September 1 of the odd-numbered year before the year when the agency would be otherwise abolished. The commission must then complete its own review by the following January 1 and hold public hearings by the following February 1.

About 20 to 30 agencies go through the sunset process each legislative session. Constitutionally established agencies are subject to review, but they cannot be abolished under the sunset provisions.

The commission may recommend that an agency be continued in its present form (nearly always with recommendations to the legislature for improvement), consolidated with another agency, or abolished, with its duties either eliminated or transferred to other agencies.

=====Other states=====
Alabama has a similar review process with a more limited number of agencies and a review cycle of every four years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.examiners.state.al.us/SunsetComm.htm Sunset Committee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060704171944/http://www.examiners.state.al.us/SunsetComm.htm |date=2006-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
A sunset clause was introduced by the [[House of Lords]] to some parts of the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]]; the act was eventually passed without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051109/debtext/51109-03.htm#stpa_o10 |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 9 Nov 2005 (pt 3) |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=2005-11-09 |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part 5 of the Enterprise and [[Regulatory reform|Regulatory Reform]] Act 2013, "Reduction of legislative burdens", made provision for sunset and review provisions" in [[secondary legislation]], i.e.
*a power to review the effectiveness of the legislation within a specified period or at the end of a specified period
*provision for the legislation to cease to have effect at the end of a specified day or a specified period
*a power to consider whether the objectives which it was the purpose of the legislation to achieve remain appropriate and, if so, whether they could be achieved in another way.&lt;ref&gt;Section 14A of the [[Interpretation Act 1978]], inserted by section 59 of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In Canada all legislation enacted under [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] (subsection three of the ''notwithstanding clause'') has an implied sunset clause of five years, this being the maximum length legislation enacted under the section may be operative for (unless an earlier date is specified).

The [[Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act]] contains a sunset clause that went into effect in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Terrorism Act |date=2007-02-27|publisher=[[CBC.ca|CBC]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnsecurity/|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Special law]]s enacted to deal with emergency situations often contain sunset clauses; one of the most infamous special laws, [[Bill 78]], had a sunset clause.

=== Australia ===
In 2005, the Australian Government decided to legislate new [[Anti-Terrorism]] laws.  These laws have a sunset clause of ten years.

In 2007, the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Australia)|Liberal Democratic Party]] proposed a constitutional amendment to make sunset clauses compulsory in all legislation that lacks the support of a 75% parliamentary supermajority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ldp.org.au/federal/policies/Democracy.html |title=Free Trade |publisher=Ldp.org.au |date= |accessdate=2011-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706125143/http://ldp.org.au/federal/policies/Democracy.html |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00709 Legislative Instruments Act 2003] legislates the automatic expiry of most legislative instruments ([[delegated legislation]]). Starting in 2015 these legislative instruments must be renewed or they expire automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ag.gov.au/LegalSystem/AdministrativeLaw/Pages/LegislativeinstrumentsAct2003.aspx |title=Legislative Instruments Act 2003 |publisher=ag.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
In the German legislation sunset provisions are applied on several federal levels.
The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]] rules a general sunset provision of six months for emergency legislation. Some [[States of Germany|federal states]], e.g., [[Hesse]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] sporadically add sunset provisions to bills.

=== South Korea ===
A sunset provision can be found in the Corporate Restructuring Promotion Act,&lt;ref&gt;The English translation of this Act as of May 17, 2010 is [http://www.moleg.go.kr/lawinfo/engLawInfo?pstSeq=57258&amp;searchCondition=AllForEngLaw&amp;searchKeyword=%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85%ea%b5%ac%ec%a1%b0%ec%a1%b0%ec%a0%95 available here].&lt;/ref&gt; which is to facilitate [[Debt restructuring|out-of-court workout]] of insolvent companies. This Act was effective during the period: 
:i) from January 2001 to December 2005 for the first time; and again
:ii) from January 2007 to December 2010.
 
Now the Act came into force for the third time on May 19, 2011 and will be effective to December 2013. 
The main content of the Act has been kept intact for the purpose of constant corporate debt restructuring through market functions and promotion of speedy and smooth corporate restructuring, while some minor provisions were modified from time to time.

=== New Zealand ===
The Electoral Integrity Act was passed in 1999 to discourage "[[waka-jumping]]" in a [[mixed member proportional]] parliamentary system. The amendment expired as scheduled in 2005.

The '''Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre''' (VTAC) is the administrative body which processes applications for universities (and other tertiary institutions) in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)]].

==Application system==
Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre (VTAC) processes applications from suitably qualified students, which may list up to 12 preferences for tertiary courses in the state of Victoria. Tertiary institutions determine whether the applicant is given an offer to undertake a course – VTAC then informs students of the highest preferred course they have been offered, if any.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.futurestudents.unimelb.edu.au/admissions/applications/change-of-preference/vtac-preferences | title = How do VTAC preferences work? | publisher = [[The University of Melbourne]] | accessdate = 9 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter 'Z' was chosen as most letters were already assigned to other divisions. Relationships with the American intelligence community were formalised by a [[memorandum of understanding]] drawn up between the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (now the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]) in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.llnl.gov/str/JulAug02/JulAug50th.html Science and Technology Review, July/August 2002, retrieved 29/12/2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
