'''''The 2000 Year Old Man''''' is a comedy sketch, originally created by [[Mel Brooks]] and [[Carl Reiner]] in 1961.

Mel Brooks played the oldest man in the world, interviewed by Carl Reiner in a series of comedy routines that appeared on television, as well as being made into a collection of records. In a Yiddish accent, Brooks would improvise answers to topics such as the earliest-known language ("basic Rock"); manufacturing the [[Star of David]] ("I employed six men, see, each with a point. They would run together in the middle of the factory, and in the great speed, they would fuse, thus creating a star. I would make two a day, because of the many ACCidents"; manufacturing the cross ("It was simple. I didn't know then it was eloquent! Two men run together … BANG! You got a cross! I could have fired four men!"), and [[Joan of Arc]] ("KNOW her? I WENT with her, dummy, I WENT with her!").

The inspiration for the skit was a tape-recorded exchange between Brooks and Reiner at a party that took place at Brooks' beachfront house in Lonelyville, on Fire Island.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The tape recorder was brought into the mix shortly after the opening salvos, as the two comics soon had the party audience in stitches. In 1961, when the duo began doing the skit on television, Brooks had just undergone surgery for [[gout]]. Because of his post-surgical discomfort, Brooks quipped, "I feel like a 2000-year-old man," which led Reiner to begin questioning him about what it's like to be a 2000-year-old man and to describe history as Brooks saw it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Brooks and Reiner have released five comedy albums. The 2000 Year Old Man character appeared on one track for each of the first three albums, and the entirety of the final two.

# ''2000 Years with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks'' (1961)&lt;ref&gt;This album was originally released in 1960 as World-Pacific #1401. It was reissued as Capitol #1529 in 1961.  See, ''Carl Reiner &amp; Mel Brooks The Complete 2000 Year Old Man'' (Los Angeles, CA: Rhino Records), 1994, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''2000 and One Years with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks'' (1961)

# ''2000 and Thirteen'' (1973)
# ''The 2000 Year Old Man in the Year 2000'' (1997)

The last in the series won the 1998 [[Grammy Award]] for Spoken Comedy Album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=41st Annual Grammy Awards winners|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&amp;title=The+2000+Year+Old+Man&amp;year=1998|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, Inc|accessdate=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A half-hour animated [[television special]], ''The 2000 Year Old Man'', premiered January 11, 1975,&lt;ref name=AMG&gt;{{Amg movie|168}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporating some of the original recordings.&lt;ref name=AMG/&gt; This special has since been released on VHS [[videocassette]] and [[DVD]]. The musical introduction was Bach's ''Sinfonia to Cantata #29'' performed on a [[Moog synthesizer]] by [[Mort Garson]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

All five comedy albums were compiled and newly remastered on a 3-CD/1-DVD box set by [[Shout! Factory]] for the 50th anniversary. ''The 2000 Year Old Man: The Complete History'' DVD was released November 24, 2009, and features an interview with Reiner and Brooks; the 1975 animated ''2000 Year Old Man'' [[television special]], and clips of the two appearing on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The New Steve Allen Show]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Many of the jokes (especially the caveman jokes) were eventually brought to the screen in Brooks' film ''[[History of the World, Part I]]''.

==Appearances in other media==
Mel Brooks appeared as the 2000 Year Old Man to help celebrate the 2000th episode of the original ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' hosted by Art Fleming (February 21, 1972), in which the three highest-scoring undefeated champions at that point returned to play an abbreviated game for charities. During his pre-game appearance he recounted how the show was done 2,000 years earlier—"It wasn't this hippy-happy-dappy game you've got here … the moment you walked out of your cave—Jeopardy!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.j-archive.com/showplayer.php?player_id=3901 Mel Brooks' appearance on Jeopardy!]&lt;/ref&gt; On the March 17, 2014 airing of the current ''Jeopardy!'' hosted by Alex Trebek, Brooks and Reiner read an entire category of clues as their characters.

Mel Brooks adapted the character to create the 2500 Year Old Brewmaster for Ballantine Beer in the 1960s. Interviewed by [[Dick Cavett]] in a series of ads, the [[Brewmaster]] (in a German accent, as opposed to the 2000 Year Old Man's Jewish voice) said he was inside the original Trojan horse and "could've used a six-pack of fresh air."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ysos.sammigirl.com/interviews/playboy1966.html Mel Brooks Interviewed in Playboy, 1966] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512095922/http://ysos.sammigirl.com/interviews/playboy1966.html |date=May 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' entitled "[[Homer vs. Patty and Selma]]", Mel Brooks appears as himself, riding in a limo being driven by Homer. After Homer incorrectly identifies the act as "The 2000-pound man thing," he and Brooks engage in a brief sketch, with Homer playing the part of Carl Reiner. When Homer is pulled over by the police, Chief Wiggum offers to give Brooks a ride and says they can do "the $2000-Man thing." Brooks agrees, but asks that he not play Reiner's part—"I ''hate'' Carl Reiner!" he says.

In the episode of ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'' entitled "The Option Period", comedy writer Rick Tahoe uses The 2000 Year Old Man as an example of an ideal comedy sketch.

The '''405-line''' [[monochrome]] [[Analog television|analogue television]] broadcasting system was the first fully electronic television system to be used in regular broadcasting.

It was introduced with the [[BBC One|BBC Television Service]] in 1936, suspended for the duration of [[World War II]], and remained in operation in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] until 1985. It was also used between 1961 and 1982 in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], as well as from 1957 to 1973 for the [[Rediffusion Television]] [[cable television|cable]] service in [[Hong Kong]].

Sometimes called the '''Marconi-EMI system''', it was developed in 1934 by the [[EMI]] Research Team led by Sir [[Isaac Shoenberg]]. The figure of 405 lines had been chosen following discussions over Sunday lunch at the home of [[Alan Blumlein]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Robert Charles (1999). ''The Inventor of Stereo: The Life and Works of Alan Dower Blumlein'', p. 160. Oxford, Focal Press. {{ISBN|0-240-51628-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The system used [[interlacing]]; EMI had been experimenting with a 243-line all-electronic interlaced system since 1933. In the 405 system the scanning lines were broadcast in two complementary fields, 50 times per second, creating 25 frames per second. The actual image was 377 lines high and interlaced, with additional unused lines making the frame up to 405 lines to give the slow circuitry time to prepare for the next frame; in modern terms it would be described as 377i.

At the time of its introduction the 405-line system was referred to as "high definition", which it was compared to earlier systems, although of lower definition than [[576i|625-line]] and later standards.

== History ==
[[File:Emitroncamera.JPG|thumb|200px|right|A mock-up of a 1930s [[EMI]] Emitron [[405-line]] television camera, constructed for the 1986 BBC drama ''Fools on the Hill'']]

In 1934 the British government set up a committee (the "Television Committee") to advise on the future of TV broadcasting. The committee recommended that a "high definition" service (defined by them as being a system of 240 lines or more) to be run by the BBC be established. The recommendation was accepted and tenders were sought from industry. Two tenders were received: one from the [[John Logie Baird|Baird]] company offering a 240-line mechanical system, and the other from EMI offering a 405-line all-electronic one. The Television Committee advised that they were unable to choose between the two systems and that both tenders should be accepted, the two systems to be run together for an experimental period.

Broadcasting of the resulting BBC Television Service from its [[Alexandra Palace]] site began in November [[1936 in television|1936]], at first time-sharing broadcasts with the 240-line Baird system; however, in January 1937, after three months of trials, the Baird system was abandoned in favour of exclusive broadcasting with the 405-line Marconi-EMI system on [[VHF]]. This became the standard for all British TV broadcasts until the 1960s.

It soon became apparent that television reception was also possible well outside the original intended service area. In February 1938, engineers at the [[RCA]] Research Station, [[Riverhead, Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in the USA, were able to receive the BBC signal {{convert|5,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} away, due to the signal being "bounced" back to earth from the [[Ionosphere#F layer|ionosphere]]. A few minutes of programming were recorded on [[16 mm film|16mm movie film]]. This is now considered to be the only surviving example of pre-war, live British television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=First Live BBC Recording | work=Alexandra Palace Television Society | url=http://www.apts.org.uk/recording.htm | accessdate=April 26, 2005| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050404005532/http://www.apts.org.uk/recording.htm| archivedate= 4 April 2005 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images recorded included two of the original three BBC announcers, [[Jasmine Bligh]] and (in a brief shot) [[Elizabeth Cowell]], an excerpt from an unknown period costume drama, and the BBC's [[station identification]] transmitted at the beginning and end of the day's [[Television programming|programmes]].

The BBC temporarily ceased transmissions on 1 September 1939, the day of the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland]], as [[World War II|war]] was imminent. After the BBC Television Service recommenced in 1946, distant reception reports were received from various parts of the world, including [[Italy]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], the [[Middle East]], [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]].

The [[BBC]] lost its monopoly of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] market in 1954, and the following year the [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial]] network [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], comprising a consortium of regional companies, was launched.

In 1964, the BBC launched its [[BBC2]] service on [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] using only a 625-line system, which older sets could not receive. For several years [[BBC1]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] transmitted using the 405-line and BBC2 the 625-line standard; the only way to receive them all was to use a complex "dual-standard" 405- and 625-line, VHF and UHF, receiver. The introduction of colour on BBC2 in 1967 necessitated an even more complex dual-standard set to receive all three channels.

In November 1969 BBC1 and ITV also started broadcasting in 625-line [[PAL]] colour on [[UHF]]. As their programming was now entirely produced using the new standard, the 405-line broadcasts served only as a rebroadcast in monochrome for people who did not have the newer receivers.  Thereafter, receivers were of a simpler single standard design which could not receive the legacy 405-line transmissions.

One reason for the long switchover period was the difficulty in matching the coverage level of the new UHF 625-line service with the very high level of geographic coverage achieved with the 405-line VHF service.

The last 405-line transmissions were seen on 4 January 1985 in [[Scotland]]; they had been officially shut down one day earlier in the rest of the UK (although they were actually switched off at various points the next day). This left only the UHF PAL system in operation in the UK. The frequencies used by the 405-line system were initially left empty, but were later sold off; they are now used for other purposes, including [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] and [[Trunked radio system|trunked]] [[Professional Mobile Radio|PMR]] commercial two-way radio systems.

=== Ireland ===
Ireland's use of the 405-line system began in 1961, with the launch of [[Telefís Éireann]], but only extended to two main transmitters and their five relays, serving the east and north of the country. This was because many people in these areas already had 405-line sets for receiving UK broadcasts from Wales or Northern Ireland. Telefís Éireann's primary standard was 625-line; it began using this in the summer of 1962, more than two years before the UK had any 625-line channels.
* The last 405-line relays, in [[County Donegal]], were turned off in 1982; the main transmitters had been shut down in 1978 to free up frequencies for [[RTÉ Two|RTÉ 2]], and after then the relays had been fed by standards converters from the local 625-line transmitter.
* For the last five years of [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]'s 405-line simulcasting, a simple orthicon converter was used, essentially a 405-line camera pointed at a 625-line monitor, as the more expensive system converters that RTÉ had previously used were now inoperable.

===Hong Kong===
{{Main article|Rediffusion Television}}

The 405-line system was used in the Rediffusion Television [[cable television]] service in [[Hong Kong]], established in 1957, making it both the first British colony and the first predominantly Chinese city to have television. The service of 405-line system ended in 1973, replaced by 625-line [[PAL]] system [[free-to-air]] broadcast.

===Other countries===
For a brief time in 1939 there were experimental 405-line transmissions from stations in [[Montrouge]] in France and [[Eindhoven]] in the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alan Pemberton |url=http://www.pembers.freeserve.co.uk/World-TV-Standards/Line-Standards.html |title=World Analogue Television Standards and Waveforms - Line Standards |publisher=Pembers.freeserve.co.uk |date=2003-07-01 |accessdate=2014-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403105251/http://www.pembers.freeserve.co.uk/World-TV-Standards/Line-Standards.html |archivedate=3 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Czechoslovakia and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bvws.org.uk/405alive/faq/405_hist.html |title=405 Alive - FAQ - 405-Line Television in History |publisher=Bvws.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 405-line video recordings ===

====Original====
A few 405-line [[videotape]]s still survive. However, the majority of surviving 405-line programmes are in the form of black and white film [[telerecording]]s, usually with optical soundtracks. Occasionally video re-recording would be employed instead, with a 625-line camera pointing at a 405-line monitor. This preserves the original 50-field interlaced format, but with some geometrical distortions owing to the curvature of the CRT monitors used at the time.

====Modern====
405-line programming may be recorded and played on an unmodified VHS or Betamax video recorder, as long as the input to the recorder is baseband rather than RF. Thus various modern video recordings of 405-line programming also exist. Betamax was sometimes preferred for this, as the Dropout Compensator could be switched off on certain models for use with PCM digital audio decoders.

== System A ==

405-line is [[CCIR System A|System A]] in the [[ITU-R|CCIR]] assignment of [[Broadcast television system|broadcast systems]]. The audio uses [[amplitude modulation]] rather than the [[frequency modulation]] in use on modern analogue systems. In addition, the system was broadcast in an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 5:4 until 3 April 1950, when it changed to the more common 4:3 format.&lt;ref&gt;Pawley, Edward. ''BBC Engineering 1922 - 1972'', {{ISBN|0-563-12127-0}}, p 366.&lt;/ref&gt;

All System A transmitters used [[vestigial sideband]] transmission, with the single exception of Alexandra Palace in London, which closed down in 1957 when it was replaced by [[Crystal Palace transmitting station|Crystal Palace]].

=== Why 50 fields per second? ===
Since the mid-1930s it has been standard practice to use a field frequency equal to the AC mains electric supply frequency (or a submultiple thereof) 50&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] in most countries (60&amp;nbsp;Hz in the [[Americas]]) because studio lighting generally uses an alternating current supply to the lamps and if these were not synchronized with the field frequency, an unwelcome strobe effect could appear on TV pictures. Secondly, the smoothing (filtering) of power supply circuits in early TV receivers was rather poor, and ripple superimposed on the DC could cause visual interference.  However, the main problem was the susceptibility of the electron beam in the CRT being deflected by stray magnetic fields from nearby transformers or motors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/java/crt |title=MagLab - Electromagnetic Deflection in a Cathode Ray Tube Tutorial (II) |publisher=Magnet.fsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the picture was locked to the mains frequency, this interference would at least be static on the screen and thus relatively unnoticeable. The very earliest TV sets used a mains transformer; care had to be taken in design to prevent the transformer's stray magnetic field from disturbing the electron beam in the CRT.

=== Why 405 lines? ===
Because an interlaced system requires accurate positioning of scanning lines, the horizontal and vertical timebase must be in a precise ratio. This is done by passing the one through a series of electronic divider circuits to produce the other. Each division is by an odd integer.
Therefore, there has to be a straightforward mathematical relationship between the line and field frequencies, the latter being derived by dividing down from the former. The technology constraints of the 1930s meant that this division process could only be done using small integers, preferably no greater than 7, for good stability. The number of lines was odd because of 2:1 interlace. The 405-line system used a vertical frequency of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz (standard AC mains supply frequency in Britain) and a horizontal one of 10,125&amp;nbsp;Hz (&lt;span title="frame rate"&gt;50 × &lt;span title="lines"&gt;405&lt;/span&gt; ÷ &lt;span title="interlace"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; or, using the frame rate, 25 x 405), with 405 being derived from (3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 5).

==Comparison with later standards==

=== Bandwidth ===
When used with vestigial sideband filtering, the total bandwidth of a 405-line TV channel is 5&amp;nbsp;MHz, significantly less than the 8&amp;nbsp;MHz required by the 625-line system I, which replaced it in Britain. Systems in other countries used anything between six and fourteen megahertz of bandwidth per channel.

=== Coverage ===
The use of VHF frequencies combined with the narrow vision bandwidth (AM signals [at VHF low band frequencies] are less affected by noise as bandwidth is reduced) meant that 405-line signals could be received well even under marginal conditions. Therefore, it was possible to cover virtually all of the UK with a relatively [[405-line transmitters of the United Kingdom|small number of transmitting stations]].

=== Susceptibility to impulse interference ===
The use of AM (rather than FM) for sound and the use of positive (rather than negative) video modulation made 405-line signals very prone to audible and visible impulse interference, such as that generated by the ignition systems of vehicles. Such interference manifested itself as a loud popping on sound and large bright spots on the picture, which viewers found much more noticeable than the dark spots encountered when such interference is encountered on a signal using negative video modulation. With positive modulation, interference could easily be of similar amplitude to the sync pulses (which were represented by 0–30% of the transmitter output). The early time-base circuits were less able to discriminate between the signals and the picture would break up. By contrast, in negative modulation sync, pulses represent peak transmitter output (70–100% output). As a result, impulse interference would cause visual dark spots before it was large enough to affect the synchronisation of the picture. If the interference was large enough, the picture was probably unwatchable anyway. The later introduction of flywheel sync circuits rendered the picture much more stable, but these could have alleviated some of the problems with positive modulation. Almost all television systems that succeeded the 405-line system adopted negative modulation for this reason alone.

=== Automatic gain control ===
The [[AGC circuit]] was problematic. First-generation AGC merely detected the average value of the transmitted signal; however, due to the positively modulated carrier, peak power represented peak white – not guaranteed to be present. Thus for a completely black picture, the AGC circuit would increase the RF gain to restore the average carrier amplitude. The result was a screen that was not black but mid-grey. In fact, the total light output of early TV sets was practically constant regardless of the picture content.

By the mid-1950s, several manufacturers started to introduce gated-AGC systems to avoid this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pye's "Automatic Picture Control" of 1953|url=http://www.thevalvepage.com/tv/pye/v4/v4.htm|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A delayed pulse was derived from the recovered line-sync signal. This pulse would trigger a gate which would sample the received video signal during the "back porch" which was a guaranteed black-level transmitted between the end of the line-sync pulse and the start of the picture information.

The introduction of negative modulation in later systems simplified the problem because peak carrier power represented sync pulses (which were always guaranteed to be present). A simple peak-detector AGC circuit would detect the amplitude of only the sync pulses, thus measuring the strength of the received signal.

=== Whistle due to line output transformer magnetostriction ===
The 405-line system produced a noticeable 10,125&amp;nbsp;Hz whistle in many sets, equal to the number of lines per second. This high-pitched whistle was caused by [[magnetostriction]] in the [[flyback transformer|line output transformer]].

This is a common artifact in sets that use a [[cathode ray tube]]. While all CRT-based television systems produce such a noise, the higher number of lines per second in later standards produces frequencies (PAL's 15,625&amp;nbsp;Hz and NTSC's 15,734&amp;nbsp;Hz) that are at the upper end of the audible spectrum, which not all people are able to [[Human hearing range|hear]]. Modern sets using plasma, LCD or OLED display technology are completely free of this effect as they are composed of a million or more individually controllable elements, rather than using a single magnetically deflected beam, so there is no requirement to generate the scanning signal.

=== Equalizing pulses ===
The absence of equalizing pulses to facilitate interlace was defended at the start of the BBC service on the grounds that it only caused a lack of interlace with field synchronizing separators of the integrator type, and that there were, even at that time, numerous other circuits which gave completely accurate interlace without equalizing pulses. The question was raised again from time to time, but a series of tests, conducted during 1952 in cooperation with the British Radio Equipment Manufacturers' Association, confirmed that there was no general need for equalizing pulses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/archive/pdffiles/monographs/bbc_monograph_39.pdf |format=PDF| title = Twenty-five Years of BBC Television | first = Harold | last = Bishop | work = BBC Engineering Division Monograph No. 39 | year = 1961 | accessdate = 2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spot wobble===
On some larger TV screen sizes, the scanned lines were not fat enough to give 100% coverage of the CRT. The result was a lined picture with darkness between each horizontal scanned line, reducing picture brightness and contrast. Larger screen sets often used a spot wobble oscillator, that slightly elongated the scanning spot vertically at high frequency to avoid this line separation effect without reducing horizontal sharpness. Spot wobble was also utilised when making [[telerecording]]s of 405-line programmes.

== Experimental colour transmissions ==
During the late 1950s and early-to-mid 1960s, some experimental colour broadcasts were made in the UK with the 405-line system using [[NTSC]] colour encoding (this encoding was a 1953 enhancement of the original 1941 NTSC monochrome standard, added to the NTSC standard so that it could also provide for colour broadcasting).&lt;ref name="Second NTSC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1953/12/18/archives/compatible-color-approved-for-tv-fcc-reverses-itself-signal.html |first=Jack |last=Gould |title=COMPATIBLE COLOR APPROVED FOR TV; F.C.C. Reverses Itself -- Signal Receivable on Present Sets in Black and White |page=1 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1953-12-18 |accessdate=2015-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subcarrier frequency was 2.6578125&amp;nbsp;MHz (525/2 times line frequency) with an "I" signal bandwidth of 500&amp;nbsp;kHz and a "Q" signal bandwidth of 300&amp;nbsp;kHz. Tests with [[PAL]], [[SECAM]] and other NTSC subcarrier frequencies were also attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alan Pemberton |url=http://www.pembers.freeserve.co.uk/World-TV-Standards/Colour-Standards.html |title=World Analogue Television Standards and Waveforms |publisher=Pembers.freeserve.co.uk |date=2003-07-01 |accessdate=2014-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221112432/http://www.pembers.freeserve.co.uk/World-TV-Standards/Colour-Standards.html |archivedate=21 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these broadcasts were on [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] (also an experimental technology at the time), while others were carried over the regular [[Very high frequency|VHF]] network outside of normal broadcasting hours.

== United States 405-line field-sequential colour system ==
After the U.S. adopted the NTSC [[CCIR System M|525-line]] monochrome standard for commercial broadcasting in 1941, subsequent efforts were made to upgrade the standard so that it could also accommodate a "[[Color television#Compatible color|compatible]]" colour broadcasting system. Eventually these efforts would prove successful, but because repeated attempts had consistently produced unsatisfactory results, in 1950 the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) officially approved for commercial broadcast an alternate 405-line broadcasting system which the [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] (CBS) had developed over the past decade.&lt;ref name="5-2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mkxQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Bg4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3803%2C5108711 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=United Press |title=Color TV is Due Nov. 20, Barring Legal Difficulty |page=2 |newspaper=Toledo Blade (Ohio) |date=1950-10-12 |accessdate=2018-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system was a [[Field-sequential color system|field-sequential]] colour system which electronically transmitted a 405-line monochrome picture. Colour was provided mechanically by means of a synchronized rotating transparent [[RGB color model|Red-Green-Blue]] disk, which was placed in front of the receiver screen. Regular broadcast channels were used to transmit the 405-line system signals, but the millions of existing NTSC 525-line television receivers could only correctly process the audio portion of these transmissions, so unless these sets were modified they would only display a jumbled picture.&lt;ref name="5-2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS aired a [[variety show]] special entitled ''[[Premiere (TV program)|Premiere]]'' on 25 June 1951 to officially launch commercial 405-line colour broadcasting, but just four months later CBS ended its colour broadcasts. CBS’s efforts were hindered from the beginning by a widespread lack of acceptance, and the ultimate setback came at the end of the year when the U.S. government temporarily banned the manufacture of colour televisions in order to conserve resources during the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pCEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=RCA Color-TV Future Rosy As Defense Curbs Hit CBS |page=1 |newspaper=The Billboard |date=1951-10-27 |accessdate=2015-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, the [[FCC]] rescinded its approval of the CBS 405-line colour system. In its place it approved a newly improved and now satisfactory [[Color television#Second NTSC|second NTSC]] 525-line standard which had been developed by [[RCA]]. It provided for colour broadcasting yet remained compatible with existing 525-line monochrome sets.&lt;ref name="Second NTSC"/&gt;

The ARGOS Challenge was a robotic competition sponsored by [[Total S.A.]] between 2013 and 2017 and co-organized with [[Agence nationale de la recherche]]. The [[acronym]] ARGOS stands for Autonomous Robot for Gas and Oil Sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argos Challenge|url=http://www.argos-challenge.com/en|website=Argos Challenge Homepage|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a gas leak occurred at the [[Elgin–Franklin fields]] and resulted in a months long shut down of production and evacuation of personnel, [[TOTAL S.A.]] decided to apply an open-innovation approach to develop robots for increasing the safety of oil and gas production sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enhanced Safety Thanks to the ARGOS Challenge|url=http://www.total.com/en/media/news/news/enhanced-safety-thanks-argos-challenge?folder=7692|website=Total Homepage|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition was won by an Austrian-German team called "Argonauts", consisting of members from Austrian robot maker [[taurob GmbH]] and [[TU Darmstadt]] with a variant of the [[taurob tracker]] robot. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roboter der TU Darmstadt gewinnt internationalen Wettbewerb|url=http://www.echo-online.de/lokales/darmstadt/roboter-der-tu-darmstadt-gewinnt-internationalen-wettbewerb_17884408.htm|accessdate=13 May 2017|publisher=Echo Zeitungen GmbH|date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE ARGONAUTS ROBOT WINS THE ARGOS CHALLENGE!|url=http://www.total.com/en/news/argonauts-robot-wins-argos-challenge|website=Total Group Homepage|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ATSC''' ('''Advanced Television Systems Committee''') '''tuner''', often called an '''ATSC receiver''' or '''HDTV tuner''' is a type of [[tuner (television)|television tuner]] that allows reception of [[digital television]] (DTV) [[television channel]]s transmitted by [[television station]]s in [[North America]], parts of [[Central America]] and [[South Korea]] that use [[ATSC standards]]. Such tuners may be integrated into a [[television set]], [[VCR]], [[digital video recorder]] (DVR), or [[set-top box]] that provides audio/video output connectors of various types.

Another type of television tuner is a [[digital television adapter]] (DTA) with an [[analog passthrough]].

==Technical overview==

The terms "tuner" and "receiver" are used loosely, and it is perhaps more appropriately called an ATSC receiver, with the tuner being part of the receiver (see [[Metonymy]]). The receiver generates the audio and video (AV) signals needed for television, and performs the following tasks: [[demodulation]], [[Error detection and correction|error correction]], [[MPEG transport stream]] de[[multiplexing]], [[video compression|decompression]], [[audio video sync|AV synchronization]], and media reformatting to match what is optimal input for one's TV. Examples of media reformatting include: [[Interlaced video|interlace]] to [[progressive scan]] or vice versa, picture resolutions, [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] conversions (16:9 to or from 4:3), [[frame rate]] conversion, even [[image scaling]]. Zooming is an example of resolution change. It is commonly used to convert a low-resolution picture to a high-resolution display.  This lets the user eliminate [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterboxing]] or [[pillarboxing]] by stretching or cropping the picture.  Some ATSC receivers, mostly those in [[HDTV]] [[TV set]]s, will stretch automatically, either by detecting black bars, or reading the [[Active Format Descriptor]] (AFD).

==How an ATSC tuner works==
An ATSC tuner works by generating audio and video signals that are picked up from over-the-air [[broadcast television]]. ATSC tuners provide the following functions: selective tuning, demodulation, transport stream demultiplexing, decompression, error correction, analog-to-digital conversion, AV synchronization and media reformatting to fit the specific type of TV screen optimally.

=== Selective tuning ===
Selective tuning is the process by which the [[radio frequency]] (RF) of the [[television channel]] is selected by a receiver from within a [[Band (radio)|band]] of [[transmitter|transmitted]] RF signals. The tuner usually performs the function of frequency-agile selection, along with rejection of unwanted out-of-band signals.

=== Demodulation ===
[[Demodulation]] means transforming the signal from the tuner into a usable signal that a TV set can use to produce images and sound without further consideration for the frequency at which it was transmitted.  It is separation of a standard [[baseband]] signal from the RF carrier that was used to transmit it through the air (or down a coaxial cable or other long-distance medium.)  ATSC as implemented in the US uses [[8VSB]] modulation, which requires less power to transmit, as opposed to the also proposed [[COFDM]] modulation (used in European [[DVB-T]], which is less prone to [[multipath interference|multipath distortion]] and therefore better received in mobile installations).

=== Transport stream ===
In the US, multiple digital signals are combined and then transmitted from one antenna source to create over the air broadcasts.  By the reverse process ([[demultiplexing]]), an ATSC receiver first receives the combined [[MPEG transport stream]] and then decodes it to display one of its component signals on a TV set.)

=== Decompression ===
Since digital signals that are broadcast over the air are compressed (packed smaller), once they are received by the ATSC tuner, these compressed packets of digital data are then [[Data compression|decompressed]] (unpacked to their original size).  The ATSC system uses [[lossy compression]], so while the decompressed data size is the same as the original compressed data size, the data produced is not exactly the same as the original data fed into the system at the transmitting site, but it is close enough that most people don't notice the difference.

=== Error correction ===
[[Error correction]] is a technology that is used by the ATSC tuner to make sure that any data that is missing can be corrected.  For instance, sometimes interference or a poor-quality signal will cause the loss of some data that the ATSC tuner receives.  With error correction, the tuner has the ability to perform a number of checks and repair data so that a signal can be viewed on a TV set.  Error correction works by adding some extra information to the signal before transmission that can be used upon reception to fill in gaps.  Therefore, error correction has the opposite effect of compression—it increases the amount of data to transmit, rather than reducing it like compression does, and it improves the quality and robustness of the signal rather than reducing it.  Compression removes redundant (and some non-redundant) data, while error correction adds some redundant data.  The reason for using error correction rather than just using less compression and keeping the redundancy that was already there is that error correction systems are specially designed to get the maximum benefit out of a very small amount of redundant data, whereas the natural redundancy of the data doesn't do this job as efficiently, so with error correction the net amount of data needed is still smaller.
* There is a subsection in the ATSC standard (ATSC-E) that allows broadcasters to add extra (and variable types) of error correction to their broadcast streams.
* This error correction service is not mandatory in the US, nor is it mandatory in Canada.
* It is not known how many HDTV receivers support this error correction standard.
* For the transmission of HDTV at 720 or 1080, an extra 1% to 3% added error correction codes will help reduce some of ATSC's poorer performance with weak signals under adverse multipath conditions.
* Reception is greatly reduced due to EMI in the shortwave to VHF and UHF bandwidth from nearby computers of all sorts [light], portable WiFi and Broadband internet [medium to strong], microwave ovens [burst while activated], cell phones and the towers they communicate with, and even power lines with [[Power-line communication|electronic transmissions]].

=== AV synchronization ===
[[Lip sync|AV synchronization]] is the coordination of audio and video signals being displayed on a digital TV in proper time.  AV synchronization ensures that the audio does not lag behind the video that is being displayed on the TV set or vice versa, so that both audio and video are in sync.

=== Image reformatting ===
Media reformatting is extremely important because the formatting of images on TV sets differs significantly according to the technology employed.  For instance, some televisions have an [[interlaced]] picture, whereas others have a [[progressive-scan]] picture.  Different televisions have a different [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]].

*By March 1, 2006 all televisions with screen sizes over {{convert|25|in|cm}} must include a built-in ATSC DTV tuner
*By March 1, 2007 all televisions regardless of screen size, and all interface devices that include a tuner (VCR, DVD player/recorder, DVR) must include a built-in ATSC DTV tuner.

It should be noted that devices manufactured before these dates can still be sold without a built-in ATSC DTV tuner; the lack of digital tuners legally must be disclosed to consumers and most name-brand retailers have incurred onerous FCC penalties for non-compliance with these requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/eb/News_Releases/DOC-281444A1.html FCC, April 10, 2008: FCC adopts DTV enforcement orders totaling over $6 million]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2006 the US [[Deficit Reduction Act of 2005]]&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 109-171, 120 Stat. 4 (February 8, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; became law, which calls for full power [[terrestrial television|over-the-air]] [[television station]]s to cease their analog broadcasts by February 17, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= | date= 2005-11-04|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9924551/ |title=Senate approves 2009 for end of analog TV |work= |pages= |publisher=MSNBC | language= |accessdate=2006-06-05 |curly= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060510144424/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9924551/| archivedate= 10 May 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} Section 3002 of the Act amends 47 U.S.C. section 309(j)(14) to provide for the February 17, 2009 deadline.&lt;/ref&gt; (this cut-off date had been moved several times previously). On February 11, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Hachman|first= Mark|authorlink= |coauthors= | date= 2009-02-11|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2340897,00.asp |title=Obama Makes DTV Delay Official |work= |pages= |publisher=PCMAG| language= |accessdate=2009-02-12 |curly= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the mandatory DTV broadcast date was moved again to June 12, 2009, although stations were allowed to switch earlier. The delay enabled distribution of more coupons for purchase of converter boxes.&lt;ref&gt;Congress Delays Troubled Switch To Digital TV https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/04/AR2009020402584.html?hpid=topnews&lt;/ref&gt;

Since June 12, 2009, TVs and other equipment with legacy [[NTSC]] tuners are unable to receive over-the-air broadcasts from United States TV stations, unless the broadcast is from a repeater or low-power transmitter. Canada had a similar analogue TV termination date set to September 1, 2011 (except in some remote northern regions).

It was feared that the US switch-off would cause millions of non-cable- and non-satellite-connected TV sets to "go [[dark (broadcasting)|dark]]".  Viewers who did not upgrade, either to a television with a digital tuner or a set-top box, ended up losing their only source of television, unless they relied only upon the aforementioned non-full-power broadcasters. A Congressional bill authorized subsidized [[set-top box|converter boxes]] in a way that allowed viewers to receive the new digital broadcasts on their old TVs.  The actual transition proceeded smoothly with about 235,000 people requesting coupons after the June 12, 2009 transition date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-291400A1.pdf |title=FCC CONTINUES DTV OUTREACH ACROSS THE NATION |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |date=June 15, 2009 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian government mandates==
{{main|Digital television in Canada}}
In [[Canada]], the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) had set August 31, 2011 as the date where over-the-air analog TV transmission service would cease in 31 major markets of the country, including all provincial capitals, plus Ottawa (the National Capital), and most other major urban centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

As of the end of 2008, there were 22 [[Digital television in Canada|Canadian DTV transmitters]] on-air and all existing digital transitional [[television license]]s explicitly proscribe as a condition of license, the broadcast of more than fourteen hours a week of programming not already on the analogue service. Unlike in the United States, there is no plan to subsidise ATSC converter purchases and no requirement that newly imported receivers decode the digital signal. Canadian retailers are also not required to disclose the inability of new equipment to receive DTV. The Canadian market therefore has been flooded with obsolete new [[NTSC]] equipment which lawfully cannot be exported to the US. A limited number of ATSC receivers are in Canadian retail stores as [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) receivers. ATSC [[CECB]] converter boxes were first carried nationally in October 2008, with chains such as [[Best Buy]] and [[Home Hardware]] offering limited selection at higher prices than in the US with no government subsidies. ATSC tuners may also be present in most recently manufactured televisions, as well as [[DVD recorder]]s, [[HDTV]] [[FTA receiver]]s and [[personal computer]] [[TV tuner card]]s.

As of the beginning of 2012, almost all Canadian broadcasters are now broadcasting an ATSC signal, with a handful of exceptions granted for low power and regional stations. These signals can be reliably tuned in most cities with a good indoor antenna and an ATSC tuner. US based ATSC signals can be reliably tuned with an outdoor antenna and an ATSC tuner in Canadian markets within 60 miles of the US broadcast towers. These markets include Toronto (from Buffalo), Windsor (from Detroit and Toledo), Vancouver (from Seattle and Tacoma), Montreal (from Burlington and Plattsburgh), Ottawa (from Watertown and Plattsburgh), Fredericton (from Presque Isle). Indoor antennas (both passive and amplified) are easier to install, but outdoor antennas are better at tuning stations from further distances.

==Setup and operation==
Most ATSC tuners have relatively simple on-screen menus, and automatically bring the user to a [[:wikt:setup|setup]] screen when turned on for the first time.  This allows the user to pick the [[time zone]] and [[daylight-saving time]] mode (as all stations transmit time in [[UTC]]), and [[bandscan]] for stations.  The scan "listens" on [[North American broadcast television frequencies|every channel from 2 to 69]], and pauses when it detects a digital [[carrier wave]].  If it is able to decode the station, it reads its [[PSIP]] data, and adds its [[virtual channel]]s to the channel map.  If no PSIP is transmitted, the physical channel number is used, and each transport stream is [[enumeration|enumerated]] according to its TSID (converted from [[hexadecimal]]), or starting sequentially at .1, .2, .3, and so forth, depending on the tuner.

Several TV stations are using or have used a temporary channel to send their DTV signals, and upon terminating analog, move their digital transmission either back to their old analog channel, or to a third channel (sometimes the former analog of another local station), chosen in the [[digital channel election]] in the U.S.  This requires all viewers to re-scan or manually add the new channel and possibly delete the old one.  Doing a full re-scan will usually cause other channels to be dropped if they cannot be received at the moment the scan passes their physical channel, so this is typically undesirable, although many ATSC tuners only have this option.  Some have an "easy-add" feature which does not delete what is already mapped in memory.  Some allow the user to enter the physical channel and an unmapped subchannel, causing the tuner to search the physical channel.  Depending on the tuner, this may or may not automatically add the station and its [[digital subchannel]]s to the map, and/or to the user's "[[favorites]]".  This may also leave the old "dead" channel mapping in place, so that there is the new 8.1, dead 8.1, new 8.2, dead 8.2, etc. In most cases, TV stations will not have the actual frequency they are currently using on their website. If the auto scan does not pick up the signal and the tuner has manual frequency scan capability try to get the actual frequency from the station engineer. This may allow one to stay on one frequency (channel) versus "scanning" (moving too quickly through) and allow one to make antenna adjustments while observing only a problematic channel.

Other errors which appear to be in the tuner are actually the result of incorrect data sent by one or more stations, often including missing [[electronic program guide]] data.  Many ATSC tuners will remember EPG info for each station, but only for a few hours after viewing a channel on that station.  Some will not remember at all (displaying only the required [[channel banner]]), while a very few others will store data for days (although this requires staying tuned to each station for more than a few seconds in order to receive the extended info).  [[DirecTV]] receivers with ATSC tuners can download the guide at any time, while other [[TiVo]] units download guide data separately.  [[TV Guide On Screen]] can also be used for this, but very few if any ATSC tuners include this (which requires downloading all guide data for all channels from one particular station).  Stations sending the wrong time are also a major problem, as this can skew or ruin guide data for all stations until correct time is received again from a different and correctly set station.

==Manual tuning==

Each digital OTA channel number is composed of a main number and a subchannel, for example 4.1, 4.2, etc.  A dash is an alternate form of representation: 4-1, 4-2...  The dot and dash are interchangeable; they both mean the same thing.  The main channel numbers refer to the same radio frequencies as previously.  However, now "[[virtual channel]]" (technically known as ''logical channel number'') numbers are common.  So, Channel 4 digital signals may now actually be broadcast on channel 43, or any other frequency.  When the ATSC tuner does a channel scan, it finds the signal on channel 43, learns that this material is called "Channel 4", and remembers that mapping.  The user can tune to "4", and the tuner will know to tune in 43.  Before a scan is done, it may be possible to access the programs directly by manual tuning, by entering 43-1, 43-2...  After the scan, the programs would usually be accessed by entering 4-1, 4-2 etc., but it may still be possible to also access them directly at 43.  If stations change their broadcast frequencies, it may be possible to access the new frequencies directly, but the usual procedure is to rescan all of the channels.

'''Algerian Olympic and Sport Committee''' ({{lang-ar|اللجنة الأولمبية و الرياضية الجزائرية}}, {{lang-fr|Comité Olympique et Sportif Algérien}}) (IOC code: '''ALG''') is the [[National Olympic Committee]] representing [[Algeria]]. It was created in October 18, 1963 and recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] in January 27, 1964.

==History==
On October 23, 1963, Mohand-Amokrane Maouche, president of the [[Algerian Football Federation]] is elected president of the Algerian Olympic Committee by members of the Executive Board. The [[International Olympic Committee]] recognizes the Algerian Olympic Committee on January 27, 1964, on the occasion of the 62nd session held during the [[1964 Winter Olympic Games|IXth Winter Olympic Games]] in [[Innsbruck]] (Austria).

'''''Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold''''' is a 1986 American [[adventure film|adventure]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Gary Nelson (director)|Gary Nelson]] and released in [[West Germany]] on December 18, 1986, and in the United States on January 30, 1987. It is loosely based on the novel ''[[Allan Quatermain (novel)|Allan Quatermain]]'' by [[H. Rider Haggard]]. It is the sequel to ''[[King Solomon's Mines (1985 film)|King Solomon's Mines]]''.

The role of [[Allan Quatermain]] is reprised by [[Richard Chamberlain]] as is that of Jesse Huston by [[Sharon Stone]], who was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for Worst Actress for this role, for which she lost to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for ''[[Who's That Girl (1987 film)|Who's That Girl]]''. The movie also starred [[James Earl Jones]] as Umslopogaas, [[Henry Silva]] as Agon, Aileen Marson as Queen Nyleptha, [[Cassandra Peterson]] as Queen Sorais and Chamberlain's then real-life partner Martin Rabbett as Robeson Quatermain.

==Plot==
After surviving their expedition to King Solomon's Mines, [[Allan Quatermain]] and Jesse have settled down in colonial Africa. They are engaged to be married and Jesse plans that they will travel to America for the wedding. But Allan is restless.

A man chased by two strange masked men emerges from the jungle, and is recognised as one of Quatermain's friends. He is delirious and is cared for by Jesse and Allan, but at night, his pursuers return and kill him.

Before he dies, he tells Allan that his brother, supposedly lost, is alive, and that they have found the legendary 'Lost City of Gold'. Quatermain immediately starts preparing for an expedition to find his lost brother. Jesse is furious and stalks off, but then realises how important this is to Allan.

Allan and Jesse are assisted by Umslopogaas, a fearless warrior and old friend of Allan's, to put together an expedition. Swarma, a spiritual guru, and five [[Askari]] warriors, accompany them. The group crosses the [[Sahara]] desert; two Askari are lost when Swarma trips a trap that opens a pit under the road to the city. Another member of the party is lost when savage Esbowe warriors attack the group. Many spears get thrown at Quatermain and his friends, but Umslopogaas deflects most of them by with his giant axe.

Quatermain and his friends indeed discover the city. The inhabitants, both black and white, are friendly, and Allan meets his brother Robeson, seemingly in good health and at peace in the society. The city boasts two queens—the noble and beloved, Nyleptha and her power-hungry sister, Sorais. But the real leader is the evil High Priest, Agon, feared by all.

Allan raises the population against Agon and Sorais, who musters an army to recover the city by force. Allan realizes that they can make all the weapons they need out of gold, which is mined by the population. The final battle ends when, atop the temple, during a lightning storm, Allan uses Umslopogaas' axe to channel the lightning and melt the gold (into liquid form) causing it to flow off the side of the structure and pour over the attacking horde, turning Agon and his army into gold statues.

==Production==
The film was made simultaneously with its predecessor, ''King Solomon's Mines'', although it was released a couple of years later. Despite the tremendous liberties both films took with the source material, being more similar in tone to the ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' film series, ''Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold'' was loosely based, mostly, on the book sequel of Haggard's ''King Solomon's Mines'', entitled simply ''Allan Quatermain''. In that book, which depicts Quatermain's last adventure (although it's just the second in the series of novels), the character and his associates go searching for a lost white tribe in Africa, and end up involved in a war between the rival queens of the kingdom. 

An opulent set was constructed for the film just outside [[Victoria Falls]].
===Music===
The film features just over half an hour of original music written by Michael Linn; for financial reasons, the producers reused material composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]] for the first film (although Linn's score does use Goldsmith's main theme), supplemented with music composed for other productions from [[Cannon Films]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sdtom.wordpress.com/2009/09/02/allan-quatermain-and-the-lost-city-of-goldlinn/&lt;/ref&gt;

The score was initially released by Silva Screen in 1988 on a CD with cues from ''[[Manifesto (1988 film)|Manifesto]]'' (scored by [[Nicola Piovani]]), ''[[Making the Grade (film)|Making the Grade]]'' ([[Basil Poledouris]]), ''[[Doin' Time on Planet Earth]]'' (Dana Kaproff) and ''The Seven Magnificent Gladiators'' ([[Dov Seltzer]]); in 2009 it was issued on its own album by La-La Land Records. Cues in italics contain material composed by Jerry Goldsmith.

==Release==
The film debuted at number seven at the box office during its first week, earning $2 million.&lt;ref&gt;Platon marches to no. 1 at box office. (1987, Feb 04). The Ottawa Citizen Retrieved from https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.sl.nsw.gov.au/docview/239020580?accountid=13902&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a box office disappointment, one of several that led to [[Cannon Films]] reporting a loss in early 1987. The other box office disappointments for the company included ''[[Assassination (1987 film)|Assassination]]'', ''[[The Hanoi Hilton (film)|The Hanoi Hilton]]'', ''[[Over the Top (film)|Over the Top]]'' and ''[[Street Smart (film)|Street Smart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon posts loss for its 1st period as films do poorly.

"I know it went through town pretty fast," said [[Richard Chamberlain]]. "I know my family didn't like it much. My father was too ill to see it, but my mother said, 'Richard, the advertising was all wrong. They should have told people it was funny.' But I don't think it hurt my chances for other movies. I know a lot of people who do a lot of movies, and some of them are good and some of them aren't. [[Michael Caine]]'s one example. He's wonderful in some movies and forgettable in others. I think as long as you're doing generally good work that you enjoy, things will be okay."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Mietkiewicz, T. S. (1987, Feb 25). Chamberlain relished lusty libertine role.

''[[The Boston Globe]]'' film critic wrote " there's nothing new under the broiling afternoon sun. It's the same: washed-out scenery, stale dialogue and lackluster performances... Except for the presence of James Earl Jones doing a depressing turn as a native chieftain, "Allan Quatermain" is just for folks who don't mind mining for fool's gold."&lt;ref&gt;Blowen, M.

Unfortunately, most of the battle scenes were... ineptly staged... Chamberlain has none of the breezy, irreverence that made [[Harrison Ford]]'s [[Indiana Jones]] such a delightful hero. In his [[Banana republic|Banana Republic]] khaki duds and a bullet-proof undershirt, he exudes the dashing spirit of a game-show host. The rest of the cast is good largely for unintentional laughs."&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, P. (1987, Feb 02). MOVIE REVIEW CELLULOID FOOL'S GOLD IN `QUATERMAIN'.

===Criticism of racism===
Based on a 19th-century novel that, though progressive for its time, reflected some racist attitudes, the film itself has been criticized for conveying some of these same racist themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/nov/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview36|title=Boy's own adventure|last=Foden|first=Giles|date=2007-11-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Africans and the Politics of Popular Culture'' provides a harsh critique saying it reached "levels of racism unachieved since the 1930s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Africans and the Politics of Popular Culture |editor1=Falola, Toyin |editor2=Agwuele, Augustine | publisher=University Rochester Press | year=2009 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IHaT0EAHlscC | page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the film has been portrayed as a comedy and a satire not all critics have been satisfied that the racist themes are excused under this pretense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/09/of-dreck-and-drink-allan-quatermain-and-the-lost-c.html|title=Of Dreck &amp; Drink: Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold and Straight to Ale Illudium|work=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Abandoned Sequels==
[[The Cannon Group]] originally planned a trilogy of films, the third film to be an adaptation of ''[[She and Allan]]'' but this was ultimately abandoned after the extreme negative reception of ''Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold'', coupled with the financial difficulties of the company at that time.

In 2011, a new sequel was proposed by [[Menahem Golan]] called ''Allan Quatermain and the Jewel of the East''. The script was written by Golan and Richard Albiston and was to be directed by Golan himself. The plot concerned Quatermain attempting to rescue his daughter from Chinese treasure hunters in the Congo. According to the 2015 documentary ''Golan: A Farewell to Mr Cinema'', [[Richard Chamberlain]] had agreed to return as the title character but Golan died before the film began shooting.

==Home Releases==
MGM released the film on DVD on February 10, 2004.&lt;ref name="dvdtalk1"/&gt;  A Blu-ray edition followed in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/18502/allanquatermainthelostcityofgold.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Blastfighter''''' is a 1984 [[action film]] directed by [[Lamberto Bava]] starring [[Michael Sopkiw]] and [[George Eastman (actor)|George Eastman]]. 

==Plot==
Jake "Tiger" Sharp ([[Michael Sopkiw]]) is a former policeman who seeks revenge after his wife is murdered. After killing the murderer, Sharp is sentenced to seven years in prison. Upon release Jake is given a [[Spas-12]] Shotgun by his old friend Jerry in order to wreak vengeance upon the crooked attorney responsible for sending him away. However, Jake instead at the last minute decides to return to his secluded cabin in the Appalachian wilderness and bury his gun in the floorboards. Matters become complicated when a group of poachers run afoul of him and kill his baby deer. Jake goes to the Chinese herbal medicinist's office that the hunters have been selling to and smashes up the place.

Jake's estranged daughter Connie then joins him with Jerry and her boyfriend, but all of them are killed off when the hunters decide to get revenge for scaring away the herbal medicinist. Jake manages to escape back to his cabin and dig up his gun for one last battle with those who would break the law.

==Production==
''Blastfighter'' was initially going to be a film directed by [[Lucio Fulci]] with screenwriter [[Dardano Sacchetti]] as a follow-up to ''[[Warriors of the Year 2072]]''.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=274}} Sacchetti later explained that Fulci argued with the producers, which led to it being settled in court.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=274}} The film had already been sold without the original intended script being able to be used, so Lamberto Bava's ''Blastfighter'' only retains the title of the original Fulci production.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=274}}

==Release==
''Blastfighter'' was released theatrically in Italy where it was distributed by Medusa Distribuzione on 25 July 1984.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802193130/http://www.allmovie.com/movie/blastfighter-v6019|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/blastfighter-v6019|publisher=[[AllMovie]]|title=Blastfighter|first=Cavett|last=Binion|accessdate=18 January 2018|archivedate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archivio" /&gt;

'''''Brcko in Zagreb''''' (''Brcko u Zagrebu'') is a 1917 [[Croatia]]n short comedy film directed by Arsen Maas.

The film, created by a band of Zagreb-based theatrical actors and produced by Croatia Film k.d., features a simple plot&lt;ref name="EC"/&gt; in which Brcko, the titular protagonist, comes from a province to the big city. It premiered on 28 August 1917 in [[Zagreb]], making it the first Croatian [[fictional film]].

Like all other Croatian fictional films of the era, ''Brcko in Zagreb'' is now considered [[lost film|lost]]. The identity of Arsen Maas remained unknown until 2014, when it was discovered to be an alias of Ante Masovčić, previously known for his theater-related work, and for being a subject of a well-known painting by [[Miroslav Kraljević]].

==Plot==
Brcko, a provincial salesman (Arnošt Grund), comes to Zagreb and meets a diva from the operetta (Irma Polak). He takes her to various places, including a public swimming pool on the [[Sava]], and buys her a new outfit. Brcko's wife learns about what is going on in Zagreb. She arrives in the city and finds the two sitting in a café. The wife makes a scene and sprays Brcko in the face with a [[Soda syphon|soda water syphon]].&lt;ref name="EC"/&gt;

==Background, release and legacy==
''Brcko in Zagreb'' was a creation of a group of actors – Arnošt Grund, Irma Polak, Tonka Savić and Stjepan Bojničić – who were members of the ensemble of the [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb]], and had also performed in [[cabaret]] acts. They felt the time had come to shoot their first film.&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt; The film's screenplay was based on ''Alaj su nas nasamarili'' (''They Played a Trick on Us'', 1912), a then-popular comedy play written by Grund, a Czech-born actor and theatre director known for his numerous comedic roles.&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HBL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="posta.hr"/&gt;

The film was produced by Croatia k.d., established in 1917 by Hamilkar Bošković and Julio Bergman, which was the first Croatian film production company.&lt;ref name="zagreb.info"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HFS"/&gt; The actors performed virtually as amateurs, with almost no compensation.&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;

''Brcko in Zagreb'' premiered on 28 August 1917 in Metropol Cinema in Zagreb (later known as Capitol Cinema and Zagreb Cinema), making it the first Croatian fictional film.&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ZK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HFS"/&gt; It was shown in a number of cinemas across Croatia and was very popular.&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;

No copies of the film have been preserved, and it is now considered [[lost film|lost]], sharing the fate of all other feature films from the earliest days of [[Cinema of Croatia|Croatian cinema]], none of which survived in entirety.&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EC"/&gt; All that is known about it is based on contemporary newspaper articles and advertisements, as well as several surviving stills.&lt;ref name="posta.hr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HAVC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="101 years"/&gt;

In 2017, on the 100th anniversary of the film's release, the [[Croatian Post]] issued a stamp commemorating the event.&lt;ref name="posta.hr"/&gt;

Today, the main prize of the PSSST! Silent Film Festival, held annually in Zagreb since 2007, is named the Brcko Grand Prize, after the protagonist of the first Croatian silent film.&lt;ref name="infozagreb"/&gt;

===Identity of Arsen Maas===
[[File:1912, Miroslav Kraljevic, Bonvivant.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Although Ante Masovčić's identity as a subject of [[Miroslav Kraljević]]'s ''Bonvivant'' (1912) had been known for a long time, the connection with Arsen Maas was discovered only in 2014.&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;]]
The identity of the film's director, credited as Arsen Maas, was accidentally discovered after being a mystery for almost a century.&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;

In 2014, Croatian film archivist and historian Daniel Rafaelić visited a retrospective exhibition of [[Miroslav Kraljević]], held in [[Modern Gallery, Zagreb|Modern Gallery in Zagreb]]. Under the painting titled ''Bonvivant'' – one of Kraljević's most important works – he noticed a legend which identified the subject as Ante Masovčić, also known under the alias of Arsen Mazoff. Rafaelić immediately suspected that Masovčić and Maas are the same person, and subsequent research quickly found strong corroborating evidence.&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;

Ante Masovčić (1889–1948) became friends with Kraljević in [[Paris]], and was 23 years old when he posed for the painting. He wrote theater reviews for ''Obzor'', a Zagreb-based newspaper, and mingled with actors and artists. According to [[Tin Ujević]], Masovčić was "well-known in the theatrical and bohemian circles of Paris". At the time of release of ''Brcko in Zagreb'', Masovčić was the secretary of the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb, which also employed the entire main cast of the film. In the last decade of his life, Masovčić worked as a diplomat. ''Brcko in Zagreb'' most probably remained his only film work.&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SD"/&gt;

'''Canter time''', '''canter timing''' or '''canter rhythm''' is a two-beat regular rhythmic pattern of a [[musical instrument]] or in [[dance step]]s within [[3/4 time|{{music|time|3|4}} time]] music.  The term is borrowed from the  [[canter]] [[horse gait]], which sounds three hoof beats followed by a pause, i.e., 3 accents in {{music|time|4|4}} time.

In [[waltz]] dances it may mark the 1st and the 4th [[Octave|eighths]] of the [[Bar (music)|measure]], producing a [[2/4 time|{{music|time|2|4}}]] overlay beat over the {{music|time|3|4}} time. In other words, when a {{music|time|3|4}} measure is [[voice cue|cued]] as "one, two-and three", the canter rhythm marks "one" and "and". This rhythm is the basis of the Canter Waltz. In modern [[ballroom dancing]], an example is the Canter Pivot in the [[Viennese Waltz]]. 

In [[Vals (Peruvian)|Vals]] (a {{music|time|3|4}} style of [[Tango music|Tango]]), the canter rhythm is also known as '''medio galope'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundodeltango.com/syllabus/Vals/silver.html Silver Vals Syllabus] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511193402/http://www.elmundodeltango.com/syllabus/Vals/silver.html |date=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which actually means "[[canter]]" in Spanish) and may accent beats 1 and 2 of the {{music|time|3|4}} measure.

The '''Canter Waltz''' or '''Canter''' is a [[dance]] with [[waltz music]] characterized by the canter rhythm of steps.&lt;ref&gt;'Dancing' (1943) Betty Lee, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballroomdancertips.com/ballroomdancertips10.php Canter Waltz] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912005959/http://www.ballroomdancertips.com/ballroomdancertips10.php |date=September 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1922 dance manual describes it as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Charles J. Coll and Gabrielle Rosiere (1922) [https://archive.org/details/danceman048 "Dancing Made Easy"] ([[public domain]] since December 4, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; "The Canter Waltz has been revived and presents an opportunity to show the use of "direction" in the straight backward and forward series of walking steps. This dance is walking to waltz time but walking most quietly and gracefully. There are two steps to the three counts of music. Step forward on 1 and make the second step between the 2 and 3 count. Give the first step the accent, although the steps are almost of the same value. It may, perhaps, help the student practicing alone with the aid of the [[victrola]] to count "one-and two-and three-and", making the second step on the second "and", until able to do the step smoothly."

The '''Carbuncle Awards''' are [[architecture]] prizes, given by the Scottish magazine ''[[Urban Realm]]'', formerly ''Prospect'', presented to buildings and areas in Scotland intermittently since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanrealm.com/carbuncles |title=Carbuncles |work=urbanrealm.com |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were established following a discussion about why policy initiatives to improve the quality of the built environment seemed to be having so little impact beyond the centres of Scotland’s key cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanrealm.com/carbuncles/2005/The_Carbuncle_Awards_2005.html |title=The Carbuncle Awards 2005 |work=urbanrealm.com |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the awards is derived from a comment by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], an outspoken critic of modern architecture, who in 1984 described [[Ahrends Burton Koralek]]'s proposed extension of London's [[National Gallery]] as a "monstrous [[carbuncle]] on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/may/17/architecture.regeneration|title=Life after carbuncles|first=Jonathan|last=Glancey|date=17 May 2004|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html|title=A speech by HRH The Prince of Wales at the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), Royal Gala Evening at Hampton Court Palace|accessdate=2014-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213205/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three award categories:
*Plook on the Plinth Award "for the most dismal town in Scotland". A "plook" is a Scottish noun for [[pimple]].
*The Pock Mark Award "for the worst planning decision".
*The Zit Building Award "for the worst building completed since the last awards".

Public nominations are made via the magazine's website, with a small group of critics selecting the final winners.

[[Cumbernauld]] in [[Lanarkshire]] has won the Plook on the Plinth Award twice and is the town most frequently nominated for the award.

The Carbuncle Awards inspired the [[Carbuncle Cup]], another [[architecture]] prize launched in 2006 and given annually by ''[[Building Design]]'' magazine to "the ugliest building in the [[United Kingdom]] completed in the last 12 months."&lt;ref name=bd2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/six-in-race-for-carbuncle-cup/5003099.article |title=Six in race for Carbuncle Cup |date=22 July 2010 |author=Watson, Anna |work=bdonline.co.uk |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter has gone on to achieve somewhat greater prominence in the media.

'''''Charlotte's Web''''' is a [[video game]] of the 2006 film developed by [[Backbone Entertainment]], [[Sega]] and [[Atomic Planet Entertainment]] and published by Sega and Blast! Entertainment Ltd.; the game was released in 2006 for [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Nintendo DS]], and [[Microsoft Windows]], and in Europe for [[PlayStation 2]] in 2007.

The Windows version of the game is called ''Charlotte's Web: Wilbur and Friends'', and features nine mini-games based around the characters from the film. It is a title designed for young children, ages 4–7.

The DS and GBA games, both titled ''Charlotte's Web'', are action-platform titles. There are several mini-games in each; the DS version supports a 'Nintendogs' style pet simulator, which kicks in during every mid-level save point.

Both titles feature the voice of [[Dominic Scott Kay]], the actor playing Wilbur in the motion picture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6376">The '''Classic FM Hall of Fame''' is an annual compilation of the most popular 300 [[classical music|classical]] works as polled by listeners of [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]] through a public vote. With more than 150,000 voters, each choosing their three favourites in order of preference, Classic FM claim their Hall of Fame is the world's most comprehensive poll of classical music tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.classicfm.co.uk/hall-fame/|title=Classic FM - Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chart countdown is traditionally broadcast over the Easter weekend, extended by public holidays in the UK, since the event began in 1996.

The compilation is notable for featuring a wide variety of classical works. Pieces by composers such as [[Elgar]] and [[Beethoven]] feature alongside works by contemporary composers such as [[Karl Jenkins]] and [[Ludovico Einaudi]]. Movie soundtracks by [[John Williams]], [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] and [[Ennio Morricone]] are also regular features of the chart. And, for the first time in 2012, the chart featured two original works from [[Video game music|video game soundtracks]].

==Criticism and controversy==
The Hall of Fame has received some criticism due to the lack of variation at the top of the chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/apr/08/nick-ferrari-classic-fm-interview?newsfeed=true|title=Rewind radio: Classic FM Interview | location=London | work=The Guardian|first=Miranda|last=Sawyer|date=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pieces that make up the top ten have changed very little since the chart began. And, as of 2018, only five different pieces have ever held the number one position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/312810.stm|title=Bruch and Beatles top radio polls | work=BBC News | date=6 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4388427.stm|title=Rachmaninov tops classical survey | work=BBC News | date=28 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4917892.stm|title=Mozart 'UK's favourite composer' | work=BBC News | date=18 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7311173.stm|title=Vaughan Williams tops radio vote | work=BBC News | date=24 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43626603|title=1812 Overture is 'top classical piece'|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=3 April 2018|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2013 provided the most controversial Hall of Fame to date due to the prevalence of an organised voting campaign concerning [[video game soundtracks]] by UK based games promoter Mark Robins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/04/02/final-fantasy-and-skyrim-beat-beethoven-in-classic-fm-hall-of-fame-3579567/|title=Final Fantasy and Skyrim beat Beethoven in Classic FM Hall of Fame|date=2 April 2013|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several video game soundtracks were voted into the 2013 Hall of Fame, with the highest being [[Nobuo Uematsu]]'s [[Music of the Final Fantasy series|music for ''Final Fantasy'']] at number three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://halloffame.classicfm.com/2013/chart/position/3/|title=Classic FM Hall of Fame (retrieved 6 April 2013)|work=Classic FM's Hall of Fame|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comic Book Resources''', also known as '''CBR''', is a [[website]] dedicated to the coverage of [[comic book]]-related news and discussion.

==History==
Comic Book Resources was founded by Jonah Weiland in 1995 as a development of the Kingdom Come Message Board, a message forum that Weiland created to discuss [[DC Comics]]'s then-new [[Kingdom Come (comic)|mini-series of the same name]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Comic Book Resources features weekly columns written by industry professionals that have included [[Warren Ellis]], [[Erik Larsen]], [[Steven Grant]], [[Robert Kirkman]], [[Gail Simone]], [[Rich Johnston]], [[Scott Shaw (artist)|Scott Shaw]], [[Rob Worley]], [[Rik Offenberger]], [[Keith Giffen]] and [[Mark Millar]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Other columns are published by comic book historians and critics such as [[George Khoury (writer)|George Khoury]] and Timothy Callahan.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

On April 4, 2016, Jonah Weiland announced that Comic Book Resources had been sold to Valnet Inc., a company that is known for its acquisition and ownership of other media properties such as Screen Rant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Rich Johnston]] |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/04/04/comic-book-resources-sold-to-valnet-and-i-get-a-funny-feeling/ |title=How Comic Book Resources Employees Learned Their Site Had Been Sold To Valnet |publisher=Bleeding Cool |date=2016-04-04 |accessdate=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was relaunched as CBR.com on August 23, 2016 with the blogs integrated into the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Heidi MacDonald |url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/cbr-com-has-new-design-rebrand-no-blogs/ |title=CBR.com has new design, rebrand, no blogs |publisher=The Beat |date=2016-08-25 |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comic Book Idol==
'''Comic Book Idol''', also known as CBI, is an amateur comic book art competition created and hosted by comics writer [[J. Torres]], and sponsored by Comic Book Resources and its participating advertisers.&lt;ref name="Torres"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Torres|first1=J|title=Just the FAQs, m’am|url=http://cbi.comicbookresources.com/cbi3/just-the-faqs-mam/|website=Comic Book Resources|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=February 27, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428145020/http://cbi.comicbookresources.com/cbi3/just-the-faqs-mam/|archivedate=April 28, 2008|date=September 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the singing contest ''[[American Idol]]'', CBI is a five-week and five-round competition in which each contestant is given one week to draw a script provided by guest judges.

==Controversy==
In 2014, the site found itself at the center of a debate around the harassment of women trying to participate in the online comics community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Polo |first=Susana |url=http://www.themarysue.com/comic-book-resources-new-forums/ |title=CBR Overhauls Forums In Wake of Widespread Discussion of Treatment of Women in Comics |publisher=The Mary Sue |date=2014-05-01 |accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate was sparked by the community's reactions to an article by guest author Janelle Asselin, which criticized the cover of [[DC Comics]]'s ''[[Teen Titans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Asselin|first1=Janelle|title=Anatomy of a Bad Cover: DC's New "Teen Titans" #1|url=http://www.cbr.com/anatomy-of-a-bad-cover-dcs-new-teen-titans-1/|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=January 10, 2017|date=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following harassment and personal threats against the guest author, the site's main editor issued a statement condemning the way that some community members had reacted and rebooted the community forums in order to establish new ground rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=CBR Staff|title=Out With the Old: Introducing the New CBR Community|url=http://www.cbr.com/out-with-the-old-introducing-the-new-cbr-community/|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=January 10, 2017|date=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[non-fiction]] [[book]], a '''conclusion''' is an ending section which states the concluding ideas and concepts of the preceding writing.  This generally follows the body or perhaps an [[afterword]], and the conclusion may be followed by an [[epilogue]], [[outro (book)|outro]], [[postscript]], appendix/[[Addendum#In books|addendum]], [[glossary]], [[bibliography]], [[index (publishing)|index]], [[erratum|errata]], or a [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]]. [[Aristotle]], in ''The Rhetoric'', tells us a good writer should do this in the conclusion: "make the audience well-disposed towards ourselves and ill-disposed to our opponent." It's a good opportunity to make inferences or predictions, or to ask the audience to consider what would happen if they do not accept our point of view by making a connection to society in general.

[[File:Cristina-kirchner-clarin.jpeg|thumb|President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] with a [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín newspaper]]]]

The Argentine Governments of [[Néstor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] had several conflicts with major media groups. Kirchner accused the [[Grupo Clarín|Clarín Group]], ''[[La Nación]]'', ''[[Perfil]]'', and related media of having promoted their overthrow.

== Background ==

The president and most of her cabinet increasingly avoided [[press conference]]s and [[interview]]s with independent media, relying instead on [[Twitter]], [[press statement]]s, and [[public service announcement]]s to communicate with the populace. Large media groups, particularly the Clarín Group, in turn opposed [[anti-trust law]]s enacted during her administration.&lt;ref name=q&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americasquarterly.org/content/media-law-reform-pits-argentine-executive-branch-against-judiciary|title=Media Law Reform Pits Argentine Executive Branch Against Judiciary|work=Americas Quarterly|date=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics maintain that new legislation passed by the Congress would be selectively applied against dissenting media and journalists, while fostering a proliferation of supportive media.&lt;ref name=q/&gt; Supporters maintained in turn that [[media consolidation]] has become the greater threat to freedom of the press in Argentina and elsewhere in Latin America, and that measures such those abolishing media laws dating from the country's [[National Reorganization Process|last dictatorship]] and rescinding criminal penalties for defamation and [[libel]] of the president, promote [[freedom of expression]].&lt;ref name=q/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viomundo.com.br/politica/la-rue-lei-argentina-quebra-um-monopolio-local.html|title=La Rue: Lei argentina quebra um monopólio local|work=Vio Mundo|language=Portuguese|date=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other press advocacy groups, such as the Argentine Journalist Forum (FOPEA) and the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], observed that the dispute polarized news media and public opinion to the point that accuracy and objectivity in the media itself had become jeopardized.&lt;ref name=q/&gt;

==Initial conflicts==
{{See also|2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector}}
The conflict started in 2008, during a period in which the government was in open confrontation with the [[Agriculture of Argentina|agricultural sector]] over a propose hike in [[oilseed]] export taxes. The [[Grupo Clarín|Clarín Group]], led by CEO [[Héctor Magnetto]], strongly supported the sector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2010/08/12/noticia_0013.html|title=Magnetto: 'Nosotros nos pusimos al frente del conflicto y a partir de allí, el Gobierno decidió destruirnos.'|work=Perfil|date=12 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their newspapers published articles that were considered favorable to the "ruralists" or ''chacareros''.&lt;ref&gt;Petras and Veltmeyer (2009), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; At least one writer who worked for one of the conglomerate's dailies (Enrique Lacolla of ''[[La Voz del Interior]]'') was dismissed for submitting an [[op ed]] opposing the landowners' [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]] of April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prensared.com.ar/indexmain.php?lnk=1&amp;mnu=10&amp;idnota=4527|title=Intolerancia y doble discurso|work=Círculo Sindical de la Prensa y la Comunicación de Córdoba|publisher=''Crítica de la Argentina''|date=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president reacted with strong criticism of the role of media, questioning whether freedom of speech "belonged to corporations or to ordinary citizens." The Government sent its "Resolution 125" to Congress, which after an 18-hour Senate debate, fell in a tie vote broken by the Vice President [[Julio Cobos]] in a surprise vote against the [[Government of Argentina#Executive branch|executive branch]] resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1030952|title=Tras una dramática sesión, el vicepresidente Cobos desempató la votación al rechazar el proyecto oficial de retenciones|work=La Nación|date=17 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source of contention with the government arose when the Clarín Group was denied regulatory support for the planned acquisition in 2008 of a controlling stake in [[Telecom Argentina]], which would have given the media group a [[Triple play (telecommunications)|dominant position]] in domestic [[Communications of Argentina|internet, television, and phone services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradingmarkets.com/news/stock-alert/grcnl_-argentina-ex-president-clarin-offered-spin-for-telephone-co-725534.html|title=Argentina Ex-President: Clarín Offered Spin For Telephone Co|work=Trading Markets}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Nación'' was likewise at odds with the federal government over an [[injunction]] issued in October 2003 that allowed it to continue in subsequent years to claim an expired corporate tax credit on payroll taxes paid; were the injunction to be lifted, a 280 million-peso ([[United States dollar|US$]]50 million) tax debt, including interest, would result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agepeba.org/lectura.asp?id=2821|title=El diario La Nación, la cautelar más larga y una deuda de 280 millones|work=Agencia Periodística de Buenos Aires|date=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nationalization of football broadcasting==

The television broadcasting rights for all [[Football in Argentina|Argentine football]]{{#tag:ref|[[Association football|Football]] or ''fútbol'' (Spanish), is what in the United States is commonly known as soccer.|group=N}} league matches had been held by the Clarín Group cable channel [[TyC Sports]] since 1992.  That contract was terminated by the [[Argentine Football Association]] in August 2009, and broadcasts of all league matches were made freely available as ''Fútbol para Todos'' ("Football for All"). These broadcasts were afterwards used to provide advertising for the government, and with the single exception of [[Iveco]] no advertisements from nongovernmental sources were aired after March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2010/3/28/economia-480705.asp|title= El "Fútbol para todos" ya no acepta publicidad de anunciantes privados|trans-title="Soccer for all" no longer takes advertising from commercial sources|language= Spanish|author= Martín Bidegaray|date= March 28, 2010|work= Los Andes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audiovisual Media Law==
In October 2009, the [[Argentine National Congress]] approved Law 26.522, known as the "Audiovisual Media Law"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leydemedios.com.ar/ "Ley de Medios."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827120944/http://www.leydemedios.com.ar/ |date=2010-08-27 }} {{es icon}} ''leydemedios.com.'' Retrieved: 1 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but usually described as the "K Law" by the Clarín Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tn.com.ar/politica/44464/ley-k-apuran-el-dictamen|title=Ley 'K': apuran el dictamen|work=TN Noticias|date=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new law served to [[deregulation|deregulate]] the television and radio industries which until then were still limited to the few channels created by the media law enacted in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minutouno.com.ar/minutouno/nota/134581|title=Reglamentan la ley de medios audiovisuales: El Gobierno publicó la nueva norma en el Boletín Oficial a pesar de los amparos presentados|work=Minuto Uno|date=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A series of five judicial appeals and [[injunction]]s prevented it from coming into force for almost a year. The Supreme Court ruled against one of those appeals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1275277|title=La Corte rechazó un planteo contra la ley de medios y marcó límites a los jueces|work=La Nación Política|date=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; declaring that it created a precedent where "a single legislator could not challenge an act of Congress,{{#tag:ref|The single legislator who acted in this case, was Enrique Thomas ([[Federal Peronism]], [[Mendoza Province]]).|group=N}} nor judges use their authority to stop the application of an entire law."&lt;ref name="cuatro"/&gt; The [[Antitrust law|antitrust]] provisions of the law remained blocked subsequently via injunctions.&lt;ref name="cuatro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1300223|title=El Gobierno pretende hacer entrar en vigor la ley de medios pese a los frenos impuestos por la Justicia|work=La Nación|date=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A court ruling in December 2012 ruled that the Clarín Group’s television and radio licenses cannot be sold until the [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Argentine Supreme Court]] can rule on the constitutionality of articles 45 and 161, which limit the amount of licenses companies can hold and which establish a divestment procedure for companies who hold more than 24 cable television licenses and 10 [[free-to-air]] radio or television licenses. The Argentine government claims the Clarín Group has over 200 licenses; Grupo Clarín claims the number is 158.&lt;ref name=q/&gt; The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the constitutionality of the Audiovisual Media Law in its entirety on October 29, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/english/notas/201310/852-the-supreme-court-declares-the-constitutionality-of-the-media-law.html|title=The Supreme Court declares the constitutionality of the Media Law|work=Télam|date=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank LaRue]], the [[UN Special Rapporteur]] on Freedom of Expression, supports the new law, which replaces the law enacted in 1980 under the [[National Reorganization Process]] dictatorship, as "an example for the entire continent." A majority of journalist respondents in a 2011 Argentine Journalism Forum (FOPEA) survey considered the new law a partial or even substantial progress compared to the previous one.&lt;ref name=q/&gt;

==Marcela and Felipe Noble Herrera==
{{main article|Noble brothers case}}
Marcela and Felipe Noble Herrera are adopted children of [[Ernestina Herrera de Noble]], the largest shareholder of the Clarín Group. It was suspected that they may be children of [[Forced disappearance|people murdered]] during the [[Dirty War]]. The President pledged to "personally" go to international courts to seek justice done if Argentine judges did not rule on the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/BreakingNews/View/30210|title=Court rules in favour of Grandmothers|work=Buenos Aires Herald|date=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charges of illicit adoption were not ultimately proven by DNA tests against the available pool of data, and the [[Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] NGO, who advocated for these tests, celebrated that the case was at least taken up in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1435763-carlotto-el-caso-noble-quedo-resuelto-por-ley|title=Carlotto: el caso Noble 'quedó resuelto por ley'|work=La Nación|date=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estela Barnes de Carlotto]] also considered that the case will remain open, as further tests will be done as new families submit blood samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosario3.com/noticias/noticias.aspx?idNot=121361|title=Carlotto en Rosario: 'El caso Noble no está cerrado'|work=Rosario 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Noble Herrera lawyers motioned instead that the case against Ernestina Herrera de Noble be closed, as happened with all the similar cases when the DNA tests gave negative results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/politica/Caso-Noble-Herrera-ADN-negativo_0_605339518.html|title= Caso Noble Herrera: tres nuevos análisis de ADN dieron negativo|trans-title=Noble Herrera case: three new DNA tests were negative|language= Spanish|date= December 8, 2011|work=Clarín}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was finally closed in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1859283-la-jueza-sandra-arroyo-salgado-sobreseyo-a-ernestina-herrera-de-noble-en-la-causa-por-apropiacion-de-ninos-durante-la-dictadura La jueza Sandra Arroyo Salgado sobreseyó a Ernestina Herrera de Noble en la causa por apropiación de niños durante la dictadura] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cablevisión==
[[Cable television]] reaches two out of three Argentine households,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seniales.blogspot.com/2012/03/85-millones-de-hogares-argentinos.html|title=8,5 millones de hogares argentinos conectados al cable|work=Señales}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is at the center of debate over the 2009 Audiovisual Media Law.  The Clarín Group's cable TV unit, ''Cablevisión'', merged with rival ''Multicanal'' in 2007 and since then controls the majority of the cable market in Argentina, including a 90% share of cable households in Buenos Aires, Córdoba, and Santa Fe Provinces (the three largest); potential competitors have likewise been stifled by [[predatory pricing]] and by Cablevisión's control of 97% of the [[fiber optic cable]] mileage in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infonews.com/2012/08/23/economia-35420-como-se-termina-con-el-monopolio-de-cablevision.php|title=¿Cómo se termina con el monopolio de Cablevisión?|work=InfoNews|date=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the Media Law, the federal government has used its regulatory power over rates against Cablevisión; when Cablevisión and [[DirecTV]] intended to increase subscriber rates in March 2010, the Argentine government appealed. Subsequently, in August 2010, a Federal Judge {{#tag:ref|The federal court involved was Cámara de Apelaciones in the ''Contencioso Administrativo, Nº 3.''|group=N}} supported the government decision and prevented the two companies from changing their basic rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minutouno.com.ar/minutouno/nota/134554-La-Justicia-falla-contra-CableVision-por-suba-del-abono-a-los-clientes/|title=La Justicia falla contra CableVisión por suba del abono a los clientes|work=Minuto Uno|date=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cablevisión later disregarded a February 2011 order by the Federal Audioviual Services Authority that the [[INCAA]], [[CN23]], and [[TeleSUR]] networks be included in its lineup; children's programming channel [[Pakapaka]] was likewise excluded, but was added in May as part of the "premium plan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/ultimas/20-161563-2011-02-01.html|title=Mariotto: Quien no cumpla la ley será sancionado|work=Página/12|date=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A court ruling in June 2013 enjoined Cablevisión to reorganize its channel lineup and to include the hitherto excluded channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diariosobrediarios.com.ar/dsd/notas/5/483-remarcaron-que-cablevision-tendra-que-ordenar-su-grilla-e-incluir-canales.php#.UedZwm21tRw|title=Remarcaron que Cablevisión tendrá que ordenar su grilla e incluir canales|work=Diario sobre Diarios|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Papel Prensa==
[[Papel Prensa]] is the largest Argentine producer of [[newsprint]].&lt;ref name=cifras&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sur.infonews.com/notas/un-repaso-por-las-cifras-del-mercado-de-papel-de-diariohttp://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/economia/2-185676-2012-01-18.html|title=Un repaso por las cifras del mercado de papel de diario|work=Miradas Al Sur|date=January 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is owned by the newspapers ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'' and ''[[La Nación]]'', with a 27.5% share owned by the Argentine government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papelprensa.com/PP-01.html "Papel Prensa"]&lt;/ref&gt;  President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner alleged that the sale of Papel Prensa by the family of the late [[David Graiver]] in 1976 was done so by illicit means and in collusion with the dictatorship to take advantage of its use against other Argentine newspapers, as well as toeing the dictatorship line when covering the Dirty War in which up to 30,000 people were forcibly disappeared. The government presented a report, ''Papel Prensa: The Truth'', claiming that during the [[Dirty War]], while being coerced, the Graivers were forced to sell Papel Prensa at a bargain price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elargentino.com/nota-103985-Papel-Prensa-el-Gobierno-denunciara-a-Clarin-y-La-Nacion.html|title=Papel Prensa: el Gobierno denunciará a Clarín y La Nación|work=El Argentino|date=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1297608|title=Cristina Kirchner atacó a Papel Prensa y acudirá a la Justicia para que investigue la operación de compra|work=La Nación|date=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterward Isidoro Graiver denied the charges, stating that the sale of the company took place while his brothers were free, and that their detention was not related to [[Papel Prensa]] but with their link to the ''[[Montoneros]]'' guerrilla group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1297876|title=Isidoro Graiver refuta a la Presidenta|work=La Nación|date=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had made statements to the contrary one month earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiempo.infonews.com/notas/entrevista-isidoro-graiver|title=Entrevista a Isidoro Graiver|work=InfoNews|date=August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was therefore later accused of being manipulated by ''Clarín''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiempo.elargentino.com/notas/se-demostro-que-fue-pagado|title=Se demostró que fue pagado|work=Tiempo Argentino|date=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Nunca Más'' report, published in 1984 by the [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]], contains no information about the Graivers being forced to give away their property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1297858|title=Sin rastros del caso en el "Nunca Más."|work=La Nación|date=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Soltys, editor of the ''[[Buenos Aires Herald]]'' newspaper declared: "Papel Prensa is an anachronistic holdover from the military dictatorship which should not continue any further into the 21st century; but not this way. It is not only that the government is at least as interested a party when it comes to controlling newsprint — if this control is established on such a mendacious basis, the Cristina Fernández de Kirchner administration is not so much seeking the truth as to be the owner of the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/BreakingNews/View/43197|title=Super Tuesday?|work=Buenos Aires Herald|date=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On same day of its announcement, the government sent the report to the National Congress and the Judiciary for further investigation.

Another source of contention between the government and its private partners in Papel Prensa is that production at the firm's [[San Pedro, Buenos Aires|San Pedro]] facility has been well below capacity and declining, leading to increasing imports of a staple considered one of national interest.&lt;ref name=cifras/&gt; A preferential pricing scale that allowed ''La Nación'' and the Clarín Group's numerous dailies to buy newsprint at a 25% discount while other dailies were charged prices based on expensive Chilean imports, was rescinded in 2010.&lt;ref name=cifras/&gt;

On April 2013 Congressman [[Carlos Kunkel]] presented a bill to expropriate the 24% of Papel Prensa, thereby raising the state's share to 51% and thus putting the newsprint maker under state control; the bill would dismiss all current board members and executives in Papel Prensa, and appoint new ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1580641-el-oficialismo-impulsa-una-expropiacion-para-controlar-papel-prensa|title=El oficialismo impulsa una expropiación para controlar Papel Prensa|work=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fibertel==
[[Fibertel]], a [[Broadband Internet access]] provider and part of the Clarín Group,{{#tag:ref|''Fibertel'' was an independent company 1997–2003 before its acquisition by the Clarín Group in 2003.|group=N}} had its licence revoked in August 2010 by the government arguing that Clarín itself dissolved Fibertel in January 2009, merging the company with its TV cable network provider Cablevisión, and does not have a licence to provide Internet services by itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiempo.elargentino.com/notas/se-quejan-porque-que-gobierno-hizo-caducar-licencia-de-fibertel-que-dejo-de-existir-2009|title=Se quejan porque que el gobierno hizo caducar la licencia de Fibertel, que dejó de existir en 2009|work=Tiempo Argentino|date=August 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The government gave a 90-day time limit to end operations and move current users to other providers. The case was taken to the courts to prevent ''Fibertel''{{'}}s closure, which would force 10% of the country's Internet users {{#tag:ref|''Fibertel'' is the third-largest [[Internet service provider|ISP]] in Argentina with approximately 1,500,000 clients in 2012.|group=N}} to change to a new service provider or get disconnected.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ar.html "Argentina."] ''cia.gov.'' Retrieved: 30 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

More controversy arose in September 2010 when the Government's Secretary of Communications office published a list of 389 Internet providers that could potentially replace Fibertel. The list, however, was totally outdated and resulted in only 22 companies still operating and only two ''Telcos'' with nationwide coverage: ''[[Telefónica#Argentina|Telefónica de Argentina]]'' and ''[[Telecom Argentina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1298559|title=No da Internet la mayoría de las alternativas oficiales a Fibertel|work=La Nación|date=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Ernesto Marinelli of the First National Court on Federal Administration Contentions was initially chosen to preside over the case, but declared himself in a "conflict of interest" because he was a Fibertel user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abogados.com.ar/un-juez-se-excuso-en-el-caso-fibertel-por-ser-abonado-a-la-empresa/6375|title=Un Juez Se Excusó en el Caso Fibertel Por Ser Abonado a la Empresa|work=Abogados|date=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the different factions in the National Congress were divided on the issue. [[Pino Solanas]] of the [[Proyecto Sur]] Party, for example, proposed that the country should have a new law to deregulate and promote all the communication services instead of regulating a single company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-152731-2010-09-07.html|title=La oposición, separada por una red|work=Página/12|date=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International notice==
The disputes over ''Fibertel'' and ''Papel Prensa'' took place nearly at the same time, and generated strong reaction from the international media. ''El País'' from Uruguay highlighted the confrontation between government and the ''Grupo Clarín'' media concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/10/08/24/pinter_510570.asp|title=Medios denuncian embestida del gobierno 'k' y falta de libertades|work=El País|date=August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of the Argentine government included an editorial by [[Mary Anastasia O'Grady]] from ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' who said that Kirchnerism is "cracking down on the free press."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703573604574493541233653908|title=Argentina's Kirchner Targets the Press|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editorial comment from Spain's ''[[El País]]'' was of the opinion that Kirchnerism is "using methods similar to those of dictatorships to keep its power" by revisiting the ''Papel Prensa'' case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/opinion/Callar/voces/criticas/elpepiopi/20100827elpepiopi_3/Tes|title=Callar las voces críticas: La nueva campaña de Kirchner contra la prensa independiente prueba su veta más autoritaria|work=El País|date=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other voices echoed a different view, including editorial comments in ''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]'' from Colombia, declaring: "The government maintains that the company sells the paper to small newspapers at higher prices than those who buy ''Clarín'' and ''La Nación'' and considered these actions go against freedom of expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/mundo/latinoamerica/gobierno-argentino-presento-proyecto-para-reducir-poder-de-medios-sobre-papel_7882931-2|title=Presidenta argentina presenta proyecto ante Congreso para reducir poder de periódicos sobre el papel|work=El Tiempo}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression [[Frank LaRue]] also supports the new law;&lt;ref name=q/&gt; as does the world's largest federation of journalists, the [[International Federation of Journalists]], whose director, Beth Costa, visited [[Martín Sabbatella]] of the AFSCA (the agency overseeing the Audiovisual Media Law) in August 2013 to express the IFJ's "support for and commitment to the media law and the defense of freedom of expression in Argentina."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infonews.com/2013/08/31/politica-95193-fuerte-apoyo-de-la-federacion-internacional-de-periodistas-a-la-ley-de-medios-ley-de-medios.php|title=Fuerte apoyo de la Federación Internacional de Periodistas a la Ley de Medios|work=InfoNews|date=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, [[U.S. Department of State]] Deputy Spokesman Mark Toner declared that the [[Barack Obama administration]] is closely following the controversy and that concerns about press freedom are taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2010/08/26/us-closely-following-argentine-debate-on-freedom-of-the-press|title=US closely following Argentine debate on freedom of the press|work=Merco Press|date=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pro-government media and state advertising==

The government has made increasing use of advertising during the Kirchner era. State publicity - at all levels of government - accounted for 1.8% of Argentina's 3 billion-peso (US$1 billion) ad market in 2003, but fully 8% of a 19.5 billion-peso (US$4.7 billion) ad market in 2011 - an almost twentyone-fold increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chequeado.com/ultimas-noticias/1370-scoccimarro-la-pauta-oficial-representa-solo-el-5-del-total-en-relacion-a-la-privada.html|title=Scoccimarro: La pauta oficial representa sólo el 5% del total en relación a la privada|work=Chequeado.com|date=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official budget for national government publicity in 2012 was 735.8 million pesos (US$160 million); the 2011 budget was $608.1 million (US$146 million). An administrative resolution increased that number by $4.7 million, a presidential decree added $112.8 million, and another administrative resolution allowed to use $10.2 million more.&lt;ref name="doslucasaldia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/politica/Relato-gastan-millones-difundir-gobierno_0_625137508.html|title=Relato K: ya se gastan 2 millones por día para difundir actos de gobierno|work=Clarín}}&lt;/ref&gt; A General Audit Office (AGN) report showed that in 2009, the largely supportive ''[[Página 12]]'' daily and [[Veintitrés]] Group received 18% and 13% of these revenues, respectively; while ''Clarín'', ''La Nación'', and ''[[La Razón (Buenos Aires)|La Razón]]'' received 15%, 8%, and 5% despite their much larger circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ar.noticias.yahoo.com/agn-denunci%C3%B3-uso-publicidad-oficial-000000396.html|title=La AGN denunció el uso de la publicidad oficial|work=Yahoo! Noticias Argentina|date=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising is not the sole venue used by the government to broadcast publicity. The nationalized soccer broadcasts, whose commercial breaks feature mostly state ads, are officially budgeted at $690 million (US$150 million). A presidential decree allocated another $38.5 million, that with a loan of $25 million to the [[Argentine Football Association]] totals $753.5 million (US$165 million). The Ministry of Economy has a special budget for this purpose of $42.8 million.&lt;ref name="doslucasaldia"/&gt; Nor is criticism of excessive ad spending limited to the federal government; a leading opponent, Buenos Aires Mayor [[Mauricio Macri]], had the city spend over $86 million (US$20 million) in publicity during the first quarter of 2012 alone, dwarfing the 8 million pesos spent on city health and education infranstructure combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bouex.com/news/max/1255_Macri-pone-86-para-publicidad2c-3-para-escuelas-y-4-en-salud.htm|title=Macri pone 86 para publicidad, 3 para escuelas y 4 en salud|work=Bouex|date=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fear of Clowns''''' is a 2004 [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Kevin Kangas]]. It was followed by a 2007 sequel entitled ''[[Fear of Clowns 2]]''.

== Plot ==

Lynn Blodgett, an artist with [[coulrophobia]], has a nightmare in which she is a young girl and encounters a clown with a decomposing face after a car crash at a [[carnival]]. Lynn's nightmares have been getting worse since she filed for divorce from her husband, Doctor Bert Tokyo, who hit her upon getting the news, and is fighting for full custody of their son, Nicholas. One night, a shirtless clown ("Shivers") with black eyes and a [[battle axe]] gazes at Lynn's house, then walks away. In the morning, Lynn is told that a family living near where she was [[house sitting]] was massacred.

At a gallery exhibiting her work, most of which involves monstrous clowns, Lynn meets Tucker Reid, a roller coaster tycoon who purchases one of her paintings for $8000. Tuck invites Lynn to his office, and after the tour, the two are attacked by a mugger, Heston, but escape. Lynn is shaken by the attempted robbery, but brushes off Tuck's offer to stay at her house. Lynn answers a call from the gallery owner and faints after spotting Shivers standing on her patio. The gallery owner then calls the police, who later question Lynn and dismiss her story.

At the gallery, Lynn reluctantly accepts an offer of $20,000 to do a portrait of a man's father, a clown and convicted child molester. Elsewhere, Shivers is tormented by voices, which tell him that he will get better if he continues to terrorize Lynn. Lynn meets with Bert and his lawyer, who state that Bert not only wants custody of Nicholas, but also wants child support, and half the rights and profits to all the paintings that Lynn has created and sold since they married. It is also revealed that Bert has been out of work for six months, and has been lying about being preoccupied with his job.

Shivers stalks Lynn as she is walking with Tuck, and later murders Lynn's friend Amanda. Lynn is contacted by Detective Peters, who tells her about Amanda's death, and that he now believes her story about being scared by a clown, as grease paint was found under Amanda's nails, and in a colorful pattern on one of her windows. In a parking lot, Bert meets with Heston, who he has hired to kill Lynn so he can collect [[life insurance]]. Heston successfully badgers Bert into giving him more money, due to the complications caused by Shivers and the police. Bert visits Shivers, who is revealed to be Doug Richardson, a former patient of his, a sex offender with [[Leber's congenital amaurosis]]. Worried that Shivers will wreck his plans, Bert orders him to leave Lynn alone.

Ignoring Bert, Shivers sends a party clown to Lynn's house to distract the guard, who he beheads, spotting Heston nearby as he does so. When Shivers leaves, Heston breaks into Lynn's home, and is shot with his own gun during a struggle with Lynn and Tuck, who had stopped by to check on Lynn. At the Tokyo residence, Shivers murders Bert, due to Bert trying to have Heston assassinate Lynn, and thus almost ruining Shivers's chance to be "cured". While the authorities are content with believing that Heston was Shivers, Lynn is unconvinced. Nevertheless, she decides to go out on a date to a theatre with Tuck to celebrate being paid $100,000 for the painting she was hired to do.

Shivers continues his mission of trying to rid himself of his [[schizophrenia]] through Lynn. He kills her boss, abducts Nicholas after dismembering his babysitter, and breaks into the theatre, where he butchers two employees. As Shivers pursues Lynn and Tuck, Detective Peters races to the theatre, having gotten an alert about a 911 call from it, and news that the DNA under Amanda's fingernails matches Doug. Shivers uses Nicholas to lure Lynn out, and as the clown is about to kill her, Tuck blinds him from a [[projectionist]] booth, incapacitating him long enough for Peters and other officers to arrive, and arrest him.

Lynn goes home, and has a nightmare about Shivers escaping from prison, and attacking her and Nicholas.

The film made its [[DVD]] debut on Feb 28, 2006 where it was released by Live/Artisan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fear of Clowns (2004) - Kevin Kangas|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/fear-of-clowns-v340317/releases|website=Allmovie.com|publisher=AllMovie|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Critical reception for the film has been mixed to negative.

[[Dread Central]] gave ''Fear of Clowns'' a 2½ out 5, and said that while the villain was intimidating and the film had "a few ambitious twists and turns" it was marred by uneven and inconsistent writing, and poor direction, though the website ultimately admitted that "For horror fans, ''Fear of Clowns'' is definitely worth a look. The film hits its mark much more than it misses and all in all is a fun ride".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/fear-clowns-dvd|title = ''Fear of Clowns'' (DVD)|last = Barton|first = Steve|publisher = [[Dread Central]]|date = 1 March 2006|website = dreadcentral.com|accessdate = 6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2/5 was awarded by [[DVD Talk]], which wrote, "Although it has a few tense moments and creatively creepy scenes, ''Fear of Clowns'' runs on way too long" and "There's some good stuff tucked away in the generally forgettable ''Fear of Clowns'' -- and I'll gladly admit that it's a marked improvement over ''[[Hunting Humans]]'' -- but it's just too dry and familiar a tale".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/20456/fear-of-clowns/|title = ''Fear of Clowns''|last = Weinberg|first = Scott|publisher = [[DVD Talk]]|date = 3 March 2006|website = dvdtalk.com|accessdate = 6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same grade was given by [[Bloody Disgusting]], which wrote that the film was unfocused and overlong, and the characters largely two-dimensional, despite the solid performances of Jacky Reres and Mark Lassise as Lynn and Shivers, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/109109/fear-of-clowns-v-2/|title = ''Fear of Clowns'' (V)|last = |first = |publisher = [[Bloody Disgusting]]|date = 7 March 2006|website = bloody-disgusting.com|accessdate = 21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[JoBlo.com|Arrow in the Head]]'s Andre Manseau bestowed a score of 3½ out of 5, and summed up his feelings towards ''Fear of Clowns'' by calling it "a decent low budget [[Slasher film|slasher]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/dvd-reviews/fear-of-clowns|title = ''Fear of Clowns''|last = Manseau|first = Andre|publisher = Arrow in the Head|date = |website = joblo.com|accessdate = 21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ain't It Cool News]] responded well to ''Fear of Clowns'' and its sequel, concluding, "If you're patient enough to sit through some lulls and low fi rough edges, [[Kevin Kangas|Kangas]] delivers some definite shivers with his ''Fear of Clowns'' series".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.aintitcool.com/node/67916|title = AICN HORROR Send in the Clowns: Bug confronts the indie horrors of ''Fear of Clowns'' &amp; ''Fear of Clowns 2''!|last = Bug|first = Ambush|publisher = [[Ain't It Cool News]]|date = 8 July 2014|website = aintitcool.com|accessdate = 26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''From A to Z''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] [[revue]] with a book by [[Woody Allen]], Herbert Farjeon, and Nina Warner Hook and songs by [[Jerry Herman]], [[Fred Ebb]], [[Mary Rodgers]], [[Everett Sloane]], Jay Thompson, Dickson Hughes, Jack Holmes, Paul Klein, Norman Martin, William Dyer, and [[Charles Zwar]].

==Background==
[[Hermione Gingold]] was asked to appear in a revue on Broadway by millionaires (and producers) Carroll Masterson and Harris Masterson and she asked her friend, [[Christopher Hewett]] to direct. Hewitt in turn recruited some of the cast and crew from Tamiment (an entertainment camp run in the summer), including the young [[Jonathan Tunick]], then a [[Juilliard]] student, as co-orchestrator with Jay Brower.&lt;ref name=suskin&gt;Suskin, Steven.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mwnv7tXZq1sC&amp;dq=%22From+A+to+Z%22+%22Woody+Allen%22&amp;q=%22From+A+to+Z%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22From%20A%20to%20Z%22&amp;f=false " 'From A to Z' "]  ''The Sound of Broadway Music: A Book of Orchestrators and Orchestrations'' (2009)(books.google.com), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0199831076}}, p.393&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The revue had its out-of-town tryout at the [[Shubert Theatre (New Haven)|Shubert Theatre]], [[New Haven]], Connecticut starting on March 26.&lt;ref name=suskin/&gt;

''From A to Z'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Plymouth Theatre]] on April 20, 1960 and closed on May 7, 1960 after 21 performances. Directed by Christopher Hewett and choreographed by Ray Harrison, the cast included Hermione Gingold, [[Stuart Damon]], [[Bob Dishy]], [[Larry Hovis]], [[Virginia Vestoff]], Alvin Epstein and [[Paula Stewart]].&lt;ref name=brooks&gt;Atkinson, Brooks. "Hermione Gingold Seen in Revue at Plymouth", ''The New York Times'', April 21, 1960, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although a critical and commercial failure, the show is notable in that it marked the Broadway debuts of writer Allen, lyricist Ebb, composer Herman, ("Also making their mainstream debuts: Fred Ebb and Woody Allen.")&lt;ref&gt;Suskin, Steven.

==Reception==
[[Brooks Atkinson]] in his ''[[The New York Times]]'' review noted that "There is no official writer; there is no house composer. Perhaps this is the reason the revue represents no point of view... Gingold is a comic of vast self-assurance who has very little variety." Atkinson praised the scenery and costumes ("Mr. Voelpel's costumes are also superb") and the performances of Alvin Epstein and Paula Stewart.&lt;ref name=brooks/&gt;  

In its review roundup, ''The New York Times'' reported that "Only John McClain of the ''[[New York Journal-American|Journal-American]]'' gave hearty support to this new revue starring Hermione Gingold."&lt;ref&gt;Funke, Lewis. "News and Gossip of the Rialto", "Round-Up", ''The New York Times'', April 24, 1960, p.X1&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' reviewer noted that Gingold "displayed much keen sense of comedy; but one bright artist cannot make the production  ....   the scenes were not very titillating  .... Musically, the individual songs were not distinctive." &lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Paul.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=wh8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;dq=%22Hermione+Gingold%22+%22From+A+to+Z%22&amp;q=%22Hermione+Gingold%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Hermione%20Gingold%22&amp;f=false " 'A to Z' Runs Mediocre Gamut"] ''Billboard Magazine'', (books.google.com), ISSN 0006-2510, April 25, 1960, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Haze machine.jpg|thumb|right|A haze machine with remote control]]
'''Haze machines''', or haze generators (commonly referred to as hazers), are effects machines similar to [[fog machine]]s, designed to produce an unobtrusive, [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] clouds suspended in the air intended primarily to make [[light beam]]s visible or create a subtle diffusion.

==Properties==
[[File:Haze Mimi.jpg|right|thumb|Haze can reveal beams of light from [[stage lighting instrument]]s without obscuring the view of actors onstage.]]
Unlike [[Theatrical smoke and fog|theatrical fog]], which is typically intended to be dense and/or opaque, haze is generally very light and subtle.  These properties allow a venue to be filled with haze prior to or during an event without creating an overtly distracting cloud. Haze typically has a substantially longer persistence ("hang time") than conventional theatrical fog.  While conventional fog will hang in the air for several minutes, a haze effect filling the same volume of space can last upwards of an hour to several hours or more, depending on the size of the venue and the amount of [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]].

The fluid used in haze machines to generate the effects are either oil or water-based.  Most oil-based haze fluids use a [[mineral oil]] base, while water-based fluids use either a [[propylene glycol]] or [[glycerol]] base.  Although both formulations of fluid are referred to as haze fluid, the different formulations are neither compatible nor interchangeable.  Propylene glycol/water haze fluid is sometimes referred to as "water based haze" to avoid ambiguity. Describing the fluid as "glycol" might cause stagehands to use automotive antifreeze, which contains ethylene glycol,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927167&lt;/ref&gt; and unlike propylene glycol, must not be used for this purpose because of its [[toxicity]].

==Technology==

===Crackers===
Crackers (also known as "oil crackers") were first developed in the 1960 and the fluid is usually, though not always, refined mineral oil.  Crackers work by use of a spray pump powered either by electricity or compressed [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] passing through a dispersion head into a fluid reservoir.  The compressed air [[aerosol]]s the fluid, dispersing fine droplets.  Because the haze is mechanically generated, this type of machine does not require any warm up time.

===Pump spray===
Pump spray haze machines use electricity or compressed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to power a spray pump connected to a mixing valve, which draws in and atomizes the fluid.

Pump hazers also includes machines which function in the same manner as a [[fog machine]], pumping fluid into a heated chamber where it is [[vaporize|vapourized]] to produce a cloud.  Hazers which heat fluid to create an atmospheric effect only use mixtures of water and glycol or glycerine.  Spray hazers which atomize fluid can use either a water-based or mineral oil fluid.

===Aerosol===
Smaller volumes of haze can also be generated from aerosol canisters containing mineral oil under pressure.  Although to the density of haze generated and the volume of space that can be filled is significantly smaller than that of a haze machine, aerosol canisters have the advantages of portability, no requirements for electricity and finer control over the volume of haze generated.

[[Image:Fog-laser.jpg|thumb|left| A laser passing through fog]]

===Ultrasonic===
Ultrasonic haze machines use [[transducer]]s submerged in a reservoir of fluid to create atmospheric effects.  Although less common than some of the other technologies used to produce haze, ultrasonic hazers are promoted as generating their effects with much less noise than other technologies.

===Faze machines===
Faze machines, or fazers, can also be used to produce a haze-like effect. These machines are typically fog machines with a fan built in front to disperse the output, creating a haze-like effect. These machines are typically considered more cost effective, with prices ranging from $100–$400 USD as compared to haze machines with prices ranging from $400–$1,400 USD.

==Fire detection==
Although the atmospheric effect created by hazers produces a significantly smaller particle size, around 1 micrometre, compared to the effect generated by a fog machine (hence the finer composition of the "cloud"), the size of particle and effect varies by manufactures and type of fluid used. Because of this haze is far less likely to set off fire alarms than fog machines or larger smoke particles.

__NOTOC__
"'''Human Error'''" is the 164th episode of the TV series ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', the 18th episode of the [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 7)|seventh season]].

==Plot==
[[Seven of Nine|Seven]] has been using ''Voyager''{{'}}s holodeck to try to experience what it would be like to be more human; she enjoys a simulation of the upcoming baby shower for [[Tom Paris|Paris]] and [[B'Elanna Torres|Torres]], and starts to develop a relationship with a computer-generated [[Chakotay]]. Outside of the holodeck, though she has been invited to the baby shower, Seven declines. [[Tuvok]] assures her that despite their mutual discomfort at such social situations, they are good for morale and encourages her to attend. Seven still decides not to go, and later discusses her feelings while seeing the Doctor about malfunctions in one of her [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] implants. The Doctor finds he cannot extract the implant, which reminds Seven that she is not fully human.

Sometime later, ''Voyager'' is knocked out of warp by a nearby explosion. Though the ship is unharmed, they investigate the source of the explosion and find it was from a warhead launched some distance away to a nearby beacon. Fearing that another warhead may actually harm the ship, [[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]] orders Seven to find a method to detect the warheads to give them time to evade them. Seven works with [[Icheb]] in the Astrometrics lab. She also continues to use the holodeck, the relationship with the virtual Chakotay becoming more romantic.

Seven begins to have difficulty separating the events on the holodeck from that on the real ship; she interrupts Torres during a situation in Engineering to present her with a baby shower gift, mimics some of the behavior she had towards the holodeck Chakotay with the real version, and becomes short-tempered at Icheb. As a result, she fails to complete her assignment, and ''Voyager'' is rocked by an explosion from another warhead, closer than the last. Janeway speaks to Seven, seeing that she is distracted, and has Chakotay keep watch on her. Seven goes to the holodeck to break up with the virtual Chakotay, but she suddenly feels pain from her implants, and calls for the Doctor. The Doctor appears in the holodeck, sees the program that she is running, and then has her transported to Sick Bay. After some operations, Seven regains consciousness, and tells the Doctor she plans to delete that program; instead the Doctor encourages her that she just needs to find the balance between her personal life and her duties.

Seven returns to Astrometrics and completes her assignment; they discover a series of warheads approaching ''Voyager'' but are able to safely evade them without damage to the ship. Later, the Doctor tells Seven that he believes her Borg implants had malfunctioned as a failsafe that triggered if a drone would ever gain back their emotions. He suggests he could remove them after a long series of surgeries, but Seven declines, believing it necessary to keep her focused on her duties. When she later encounters Chakotay, he invites her to a dinner party for the senior crew that even Tuvok is attending, but she declines and walks away.

'''''Jim''''' is a [[comic book]] series by [[Jim Woodring]]. It began in 1980{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} as a self-published [[zine]] and was picked up by [[Fantagraphics Books]] in 1986 after cartoonist [[Gil Kane]] introduced Woodring to Fantagraphics co-owner [[Gary Groth]].  The publisher released four magazine-sized black-and-white issues starting in September 1987. A comic book-sized continuation, ''Jim Volume II'', with some color, began in 1993 and ran for six issues until 1996.

''Jim'', which Woodring described as an "autojournal", contained comics on a variety of subjects, many based on dreams, as well as [[surrealism|surreal]] drawings and free-form text which resembled Jimantha [[automatic writing]]. Besides dreams, the work drew on Woodring's childhood experiences, [[hallucination]]s, past [[alcoholism]], and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] beliefs. It also included stories of recurring Woodring characters such as Pulque (the embodiment of [[drunkenness]]), boyhood friends Chip and Monk, and, in ''Volume II'', his signature creation [[Frank (comics)|Frank]].

==Content==

''Jim'' is made up of a variety of short comics, text pieces, and artwork.  Most of the works are short comics based on Woodring's dreams.  Some of the pieces are surreal parodies of advertisements in the ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' tradition.{{sfn|Constant|2014}}

==Publication==

The series began as a photocopied 12-page [[minicomic]] that Woodring self-published in 1980.  The contents were drawn from Woodring's autojournal—a journal in which he recorded his dreams in comics, prose, drawings, and paintings.{{sfn|Van Winkle|2014}}  [[Fantagraphics Books]] co-owner [[Gary Groth]] began publishing the series;{{sfn|Constant|2014}} the four issues of the first volume ran from 1987 to 1990.{{sfn|Spurgeon|2013}}

Most of the contents of the first volume were reprinted in the book collection ''The Book of Jim'' in 1993.{{sfn|Spurgeon|2013}}  A collection of both volumes appeared in 2014 under the title ''Jim'', subtitled ''Jim Woodring's Notorious Autojournal''.{{sfn|Constant|2014}}

==Reception==

Comics critic Joe McCulloch stated, "What Woodring did better than anyone was promote the idea that the subconscious, the imaginary, and the dreamtime state were perfectly valid terrains for autobiographical exploration" at a time when the confessional work of [[Justin Green (cartoonist)|Justin Green]] and the mundane stories of [[Harvey Pekar]] defined the range of [[autobiographical comics]].{{sfn|Spurgeon|2013}}

[[File:Comic mural Le jeune Albert, Yves Chaland, Bruxelles.jpg|{{largethumb}}|[[Yves Chaland]]: ''Le jeune Albert''&lt;br&gt;([[Brussels' Comic Book Route]])]]

'''''Ligne claire''''' ([[French language|French]] for "clear line") is a style of [[drawing]] pioneered by [[Hergé]], the Belgian creator of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''. It uses clear strong lines all of the same width and no [[hatching]], while contrast is downplayed as well. Cast shadows are often illuminate. Additionally, the style often features strong colours and a combination of cartoonish characters against a realistic background. All these elements together can result in giving comics drawn this way a flat aspect. The name was coined by [[Joost Swarte]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Pleban, Dafna. [http://comicfoundry.com/?p=1526 "Investigating the Clear Line Style," ComicFoundry (Nov. 7, 2006).] Accessed Oct. 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Hergé started out drawing in a much looser, rougher style which was likely influenced by  American [[comic strip]] artists of the late 1920s and 1930s, such as [[Gluyas Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;Heer, Jeet. "Barnaby and American Clear Line Cartooning." ''Barnaby Volume One'' by [[Crockett Johnson]]. Fantagraphics Books, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George McManus]]. However the precise lines which characterize most of his work, are firmly in place from early on (e.g.: the colored version of ''The Blue Lotus'' (released in 1946) is based on the original black and white newspaper version from 1934–35 and not redrawn).&lt;ref name="rg"&gt;Fingeroth, Danny. ''The Rough Guide to Graphic Novels''. Rough Guides, 2008. {{ISBN|1843539934}} (p. 25).&lt;/ref&gt; For Hergé, the style was not limited to the drawings but extended to the story: the plot must be straightforward.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Much of the "Brussels school" started to use this style, notably [[Edgar Pierre Jacobs|Edgar P. Jacobs]], [[Bob de Moor]], [[Roger Leloup]], and [[Jacques Martin (comics)|Jacques Martin]],&lt;ref name="rg" /&gt; many of whom also worked for ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine.

The ''ligne claire'' style achieved its highest popularity in the 1950s, but its influence started to wane in the 1960s and was seen as old-fashioned by the new generation of comic book artists. In the late 1970s, it experienced a resurgence of interest, largely due to [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artists like [[Joost Swarte]]&lt;ref name="rg" /&gt; and [[Theo van den Boogaard]], who had come up through the Dutch underground comics scene, as well as the French artist [[Jacques Tardi]]. [[Henk Kuijpers]] was also successful in his application of the style.

Throughout the 1980s, [[Yves Chaland]], [[Ted Benoit]], [[Serge Clerc]] and [[Floc'h]] relaunched the ''ligne claire'' style in France. This incarnation was a very stylistic and artistic variation, which the artists also utilized for illustrating posters and LP covers etc. Swarte dubbed this variant "atoomstijl" ("atomic style").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulgravett.com/articles/article/in_search_of_the_atom_style1 In Search of the Atom Style] [[Paul Gravett]], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atoomstijl.nl/index.html Atoomstijl.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary use of the ''ligne claire'' is often ironic or post-modern. For example, Van den Boogaard used the simple, clear style to set up a conflict with the amorality of his characters, while Tardi used it in his ''[[The Extraordinary Adventures of Adèle Blanc-Sec|Adèle Blanc-Sec]]'' series to create a nostalgic atmosphere which is then ruthlessly undercut by the story. A recent serious clear line artist is the [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] [[Peter van Dongen]], who created the ''[[Rampokan]]'' series about the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonisation of Indonesia]].

''Ligne claire'' is not confined to [[Franco-Belgian comics]]. British artists such as [[Martin Handford]], [[Bryan Talbot]] and [[Garen Ewing]]; Norwegian artists like [[Jason (comics)|Jason]]; American artists like [[Chris Ware]], [[Geof Darrow]], [[Jason Lutes]], and [[Jason Little (cartoonist)|Jason Little]]; Italian artists such as [[Vittorio Giardino]]:&lt;ref name="rg" /&gt; and Spanish artists such as [[Francesc Capdevila Gisbert]] ("[[:es:Max|Max]]") have also used it.

Before achieving success, Strebler worked odd jobs ranging from a magician pitchman at Houdini's magic shop to working security at nightclubs in Las Vegas.

Strebler developed a professional persona around his signature "Liquid Metal"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penguinmagic.com/magician/morgan-strebler].

[[Image:Little Grill open mic 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A poet reads her work at the [[Little Grill Collective|Little Grill]] open mic in [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]].]]

An '''open mic''' or '''open mike''' (derived from the expression "open microphone") is a live show at a [[coffeehouse]], [[nightclub]], [[comedy club]], [[strip club]], [[institution]] or [[pub]] at which audience members who are amateur performers or professionals who want to try out new material or plug an upcoming show are given the opportunity to perform onstage. Typically, as the name suggests, the performer is provided with a [[microphone]] which is plugged into a [[PA system]], to make the individual's performance loud enough for the audience to hear. Often the performers sign up in advance for a time slot with the host or [[master of ceremonies]], typically an experienced performer or the venue manager or owner. The master of ceremonies may screen potential candidates for suitability for the venue and give individuals a time to perform in the show. These events are focused on performance arts like [[poetry]] and [[spoken word]], music (often [[singer-songwriter]]s who [[accompaniment|accompany]] themselves on guitar), and [[comedy]]. Less commonly, small groups, such as a small [[rock band]] duo/trio or a comedy duo may appear. Group performances are uncommon, because of the space and the logistics of loading in and [[soundcheck]]ing such a group. In strip club terms, '''amateur night''' is a contest for everyday women and men who compete for a cash prize by [[Striptease|taking their clothes off]] just like everyday [[strippers]].

Open mic nights may have no [[cover charge]], or a very low cover charge, although the venue may have a [[gratuity jar]] or "pass the hat" for donations. Venues that have no charge make revenue from selling [[alcoholic beverage]]s and food. The performers are not typically paid, although the venue may recompense the performers with a beverage or meal. The host or MC, as an experienced professional, is usually paid for her/his services. The host or MC may perform at some point during the evening, either a full set or to fill in when an amateur member is not available for her/his slot. Open mic events are somewhat related to [[jam session]]s, in that in both cases amateur performers are given the opportunity to sing or play instruments. The difference is that jam sessions often involve musical ensembles, possibly even a [[house band]] or [[rhythm section]] and a jam session may involve the participation of professional performers, especially at a high-end [[jazz club]].

==Poetry and spoken word==
Poetry and spoken word open mics feature a host, who is normally a [[poet]] or spoken word artist, poets and spoken word artists, and audience members. A sign-up is done before the show begins, so that the host has a list of names to call from. Some spoken word artists use [[pseudonym]]s or [[stage name]]s when they perform. Poetry/spoken word open mics range from laid back, serene settings to lively sessions where readers and/or performers compete for audience applause. They are usually held in libraries, [[coffee house]]s, cafes, bookstores and bars.

Each poet or spoken word artist is often asked to keep their performances to a minimum/specified time slot, giving each performer enough time to share some of their work with the audience. The host or MC acts as a "gatekeeper", determining which performers are suitable for the event. If a performer goes over their time limit, the host diplomatically thanks the performer for their contribution and asks them to yield the stage for the next performer.

==Comedy==
Comedy open mic nights can be held at established [[comedy club]]s, but are more commonly held at other venues with or without a stage, often the upstairs or back room of a pub or bar. Such nights give newer or emerging comedians an opportunity to practice and improve, with a view to getting paid work in the future. More experienced comedians may use open mics as an opportunity to work out newer material or a new character, as the audience is not paying in anticipation of seeing their normal act. In a typical open mic night, newer acts will get three or maybe five minutes of stage time, but more experienced acts may get ten or more minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pdxcomedyblog.com/openmics |title=PDX Comedy Blog |website=PDX Comedy Blog |access-date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are booked shows, regular open mics and "bringer" shows. A booked show is usually booked week in advance with some lottery spots selected by pulling candidates' names from a hat. With a regular open mic, a person puts their name on the list and they go on when their name is called by the host. With a "bringer" show, each performer has to bring a certain number of people (friends, family members, etc.) to get on stage. Open mic shows may have no cover charge, a reduced cover charge, or a minimum drink requirement. Open mic comedy nights are most widespread in larger English-speaking cities with a well-established stand-up comedy scene, especially [[London]] and [[New York City|New York]]. In these cities, with a plethora of aspiring comedians, the greatest challenge may be in attracting an audience.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Music==
[[Image:Open Mic No Name Bar Sausalito CA July 2008.jpg|left|140px|thumb|A musician performs open mic at No Name Bar in [[Sausalito, California]].]]
These shows provide an opportunity for emerging musicians to gain experience performing to a live audience without having to go through the process of getting normal music gigs, which is very difficult to do without experience or a demo recording.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Open mics provide an outlet for [[singer-songwriter]]s. Prior to their popularity, the only outlet generally were [[folk clubs]], which were not always friendly towards creators of new music, preferring traditional, well-known music. They also suggested that music performed by [[acoustic music]]ians or solo artists in this manner would necessarily be folk music, a misconception that still commonly exists today. Some organizers have chosen the title "acoustic night" or "acoustic club" in an attempt to indicate an event run broadly on the lines of a folk club, but with a much wider range of musical styles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Open mic events are most commonly held in the middle of the week or at the very end of the weekend when footfall through venues is low. They rarely occur on the hallowed Friday and Saturday night time slots when venues are busy with weekend revellers and any live performance is usually specifically booked, professional artists. The most common night for a [[UK]] open mic event is Thursday, followed by Wednesday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Mic Finder Statistics|url=http://openmicfinder.co.uk/Statistics|work=Open Mic Finder Statistics|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the largest ongoing open mic-styled music contest is [[Open Mic UK]], which regularly attracts 10,000 participants of all genres. The grand prize for the contest is an investment up to £30,000. The size of the event has necessitated that all participants sign up for performance slots beforehand, instead of simply walking onstage.&lt;ref name="tenwinners"&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Open_mic_blues_night.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Open mic blue jam, 2015]]
A popular open mic arrangement in the United States is the "Blues Night".  In this format a bar or club will dedicate a particular night, usually in the middle of the week, as being "open mic blues night".  The establishment may supply a [[house band]], typically guitar, bass and drums, sometimes a [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]]. Singers, guitarists, harmonica performers who wish to play sign up, usually with the master-of-ceremonies or host. This person is tasked with screening the performers, choosing and ordering, and getting the performers on and off stage in a polite manner.

Since the songs chosen need to be simple enough so that a band of musicians who have not played together can perform them without practice, blues standards are used.  Songs might be announced as a "12-bar fast shuffle in C" or "slow 12-bar blues in F", or similar phrases, that should be familiar to all concerned. Lead singers, keyboards, horn players, (usually saxophones) and various percussion instruments are common additions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rayrayblues.com/bluesjams/|title=Phoenix Blues Jams|first=|last=rayray|website=www.rayrayblues.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strip club==
In most strip clubs, amateur night is a contest held by the clubs themselves where women and men compete for cash by stripping just like their stripper counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scorestampa.com/blog/2015/02/01/want-to-be-a-stripper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stripclubs-of-las-vegas.com/deja-vu-showgirls-strip-club-review.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rarer niche variations==
The terms "open deck" (where ''deck'' refers to the kind of [[Phonograph|turntable]] used by a [[DJ]]) and "open reel" (where ''reel'' refers to a [[35 mm film]] reel) are used for more niche open mic events where keen amateurs can meet to exhibit and [[critique]] their skills/artform. A decrease in the cost of consumer video technology combined with the powerful editing capabilities of modern PCs has caused an increase in the popularity of DJing and amateur filmmaking, but these types of events are still very rare.

'''''Oz the Great and Powerful''''' is a 2013 American [[fantasy film]] directed by [[Sam Raimi]] and written by [[David Lindsay-Abaire]] and Mitchell Kapner. Based on [[L. Frank Baum]]'s [[List of Oz books|''Oz'' novels]] and set 20 years before the events of the [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|original novel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schaefer|first=Sandy|title=No Dorothy in 'Oz the Great and Powerful' Sequel; WB Developing New 'Oz' TV Series|url=http://screenrant.com/oz-great-powerful-sequel-dorothy-wizard-oz-tv-show/|accessdate=April 10, 2014|newspaper=Screen Rant, LLC|date=March 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the film is a &lt;!--Please see talk page before changing this.--&gt;[[Spiritual successor|spiritual prequel]]&lt;!--Please see talk page before changing this.--&gt; to the 1939 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brookes|title=One More Trip to Land of Oz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/business/media/disney-gambles-on-box-office-wizardry-of-oz.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=March 5, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starring [[James Franco]], [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]], [[Rachel Weisz]], [[Mila Kunis]], [[Zach Braff]], [[Bill Cobbs]], [[Joey King]] and [[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]], the film tells the story of [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Oscar Diggs]], a deceptive magician who arrives in the [[Land of Oz]] and encounters three witches: [[Wicked Witch of the West|Theodora]], [[Wicked Witch of the East|Evanora]] and [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]]. Oscar is then enlisted to restore order in Oz while struggling to resolve conflicts with the witches and himself.

Kapner began developing an origin story for the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]] after a lifelong interest of wanting to create one for the character. [[Walt Disney Pictures]] then commissioned the film's production in 2009 with [[Joe Roth]] as producer and [[Grant Curtis]], [[Joshua Donen]], Philip Steuer and Palak Patel serving as executive producers. Raimi was hired to direct the following year. After [[Robert Downey Jr.]] and [[Johnny Depp]] declined the titular role, Franco was cast in February 2011 with [[principal photography]] commencing five months later. [[Danny Elfman]] composed the film's score.

''Oz the Great and Powerful'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on February 14, 2013 followed by a general theatrical release on March 8, 2013 in [[Disney Digital 3-D]], [[RealD 3D]] and [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]] formats. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film grossed over $493 million worldwide against a $200 million budget, making it the 13th-highest-grossing [[2013 in film|film of 2013]].&lt;!-- Per WP:LEAD, the lead must summarize all parts of the article.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. --&gt;
In 1905 [[Kansas]], [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Oscar Diggs]] is a [[Magician (illusion)|magician]] and [[Confidence trick|con artist]] working for a [[Circus|traveling circus]]. As a storm approaches, the circus [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] learns that Oscar has flirted with his wife and threatens him. Oscar promptly escapes in a [[hot air balloon]], but is sucked into a [[tornado]] that takes him to the [[Land of Oz]]. There he encounters the beautiful and naïve witch Theodora, who believes him to be the wizard prophesied to become King of Oz by destroying the Wicked Witch who killed the previous king. The idea of being a wealthy monarch makes Oscar accept the role. En route to the [[Emerald City]], Theodora falls in love with Oscar though he does not reciprocate her feelings. They then encounter the flying monkey Finley who pledges a life debt to Oscar when he saves him from a [[Cowardly Lion|lion]]. Oscar reveals his deception to Finley and forces him to maintain the lie that he is really a wizard.

At the Emerald City Theodora's beautiful older sister Evanora tells Oscar that the Wicked Witch resides in the Dark Forest and can be killed by destroying her wand. On the way to the forest they are joined by China Girl, a living [[china doll]] whose village and family were destroyed by the Wicked Witch. The three reach the forest and discover the "Wicked Witch" is the late king's daughter [[Glinda the Good Witch]], and Evanora is the true Wicked Witch. Evanora sees this with her [[crystal ball]] and tricks Theodora into thinking Oscar is trying to court all three witches at once. She offers Theodora a magic apple "to remove her heartache" but it turns her into a [[Wicked Witch of the West|hideous green-skinned witch]].

Glinda brings Oscar's group to her domain to escape Evanora's army of [[Winkie Country|Winkies]] and flying [[baboon]]s. She confides in Oscar that she knows he is not a wizard but still believes he can help stop Evanora. He reluctantly takes charge of an "army" of [[Quadling]]s, Tinkers and [[Munchkin]]s. Theodora enters Glinda's domain and angrily reveals her new hideous appearance to Oscar before threatening to kill him and his allies with the Emerald City's well-prepared army. Oscar despairs at his chances of victory, but after telling China Girl about the exploits of his hero [[Thomas Edison]] he conceives a plan that relies on [[sleight of hand|trickery]].

Glinda and her subjects mount a fake attack on the Emerald City using a pulley-rig army of [[scarecrow]] puppets hidden by thick fog. The witches are tricked into sending their flying baboons through a [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]] field that puts them to sleep. However two baboons capture Glinda. Meanwhile, Oscar infiltrates the Emerald City with his allies but apparently abandons them in a hot air balloon loaded with gold, which Theodora destroys with a fireball. As the wicked sisters prepare to execute Glinda, Oscar appears, having faked his betrayal and death. Using a hidden [[Fog machine|smoke machine]] and [[Projector|image projector]], he presents a giant image of his face as his "true" form and a fireworks display to intimidate the Wicked Witches. Evanora fearfully hides in her castle while Theodora flees on her broom, unable to hurt the "invincible" wizard. Oscar offers to Theodora that she would be welcome to return if she overcomes her wickedness, but Theodora refuses and flies away to the West laughing maniacally, leaving Oscar saddened. China Girl frees Glinda who engages Evanora in a magical duel. Glinda destroys Evanora's emerald necklace revealing her to be an old hag. Evanora is carried away by two flying baboons as she vows revenge.

Oscar, now ruler of Oz, uses his projector to sustain the belief that he is a powerful wizard. He presents gifts to his friends: Master Tinker, who helped build his machines, receives Oscar's [[Pocket knife|jackknife]] while Knuck, the grumpy Munchkin herald, receives a mask with a smiley face; the long-suffering Finley receives Oscar's friendship along with his top hat and China Girl accepts her friends as her new family. Finally, Oscar takes Glinda behind the curtains of his projector, thanks her for making him a better person, and they kiss.

==Continuity==
''Oz the Great and Powerful'' features several artistic allusions, [[Homage (arts)|homage]]s and technical parallels to Baum's novels and the 1939 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film, ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.

The film's opening sequence is presented in black and white. When Oscar is caught up in the tornado, the audio switches from monaural to stereo and eventually surround sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Patterson|first=John|title='Oz the Great and Powerful': Sam Raimi's not in Kansas anymore|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/09/oz-the-great-and-the-powerful-sam-raimi|accessdate=19 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film shifts to full color when Oscar arrives in Oz; additionally, the [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] gradually widens from [[Academy ratio|4:3 Academy ratio]] to [[Aspect ratio (image)|2.35:1 widescreen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Drew|title=Oz the Great and Powerful': 10 Differences Between the Prequel and 'Wizard of Oz|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2013/03/06/oz-the-great-and-powerful-differences-wizard-of-oz_n_2820326.html#slide=2189907|accessdate=March 7, 2013|newspaper=Moviefone|date=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Patterson|first=John|title='Oz the Great and Powerful': Sam Raimi's not in Kansas anymore|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/09/oz-the-great-and-the-powerful-sam-raimi|accessdate=March 19, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the 1939 film, Glinda travels in giant bubbles, and the Emerald City is actually emerald; in the novel, characters wear tinted glasses to make it appear so. However, during the battle preparations sequence Oz can be seen wearing emerald goggles. The iconic green look of the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] is closer to her look in the 1939 film, as the Witch is a short, one-eyed crone in the novel. The Wicked Witches are portrayed as sisters, an idea which originated in the 1939 film. Also from the 1939 film is that several actors who play Oz characters make cameos in the Kansas segments, such as Frank, Oscar's assistant whom he refers to as his "trained monkey" (Frank's "Oz" counterpart is the winged monkey Finley) and a young girl in a wheelchair who serves as the Kansas counterpart to China Girl (in Kansas, Oscar is unable to make the wheelchair-bound young girl walk, and gets a chance to do so when he repairs China Girl's broken legs). Annie, a woman wearing a [[gingham]] dress who inspires Oscar to be a good and great person, informs him that she has been [[Marriage proposal|proposed]] to by John Gale, presumably hinting at [[Dorothy Gale]]'s parental lineage (Annie's "Oz" counterpart, Glinda, also inspires Oscar to be a better person).&lt;ref name="dorothy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Covert|first=Colin|title='Oz the Great and Powerful' is big and beautiful|url=http://www.salisburypost.com/article/20130310/SP03/130319982/1011|accessdate=March 11, 2013|newspaper=Salisbury Post|date=March 10, 2013|quote=He makes a young, svelte, rather hot conjurer who has broken many a heart, including that of Dorothy Gale's mom-to-be (liquid-eyed Michelle Williams, resplendent in a blond wig).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other referenced characters include the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], who is built by the townspeople as a scare tactic, and the [[Tin Woodman]], whose creator is the Master Tinker that can build "anything", and the lion that attacks Finley, a reference to the [[Cowardly Lion]].&lt;ref name="cameo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Allport|first=Lee|title=Oz the Great and Powerful: A Prequel at Its Best|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lee-allport/oz-the-great-and-powerful_1_b_2811167.html|accessdate=March 10, 2013|date=March 8, 2013|quote=There are other interesting "that explains it" moments as well. We get up-close-and-personal with The Cowardly Lion and find out what spooked him into being afraid of his own shadow. We get to know the Tin Man's father and the creators of the Scarecrow and learn more about Munchkinland.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, various other races of Oz are depicted besides the [[Munchkin Country|Munchkins]]; the [[Quadling Country|Quadlings]], the china doll inhabitants of [[Quadling Country|Dainty China Country]], and the [[Winkie Country|Winkies]] (who went unnamed in the 1939 film). Similarly, Glinda is referred to by her title in the novel (the Good Witch of the South), unlike the 1939 film, where her character's title is "Good Witch of the North" (due to her character being merged with the [[Good Witch of the North]]). Glinda is also the daughter of the late King of Oz, though in the novels, [[Princess Ozma|Ozma]] is the King's daughter. Theodora's tears leave streaks of scars on her face, reflecting her weakness to water in the original novel/film. Also, Oz is presented as a real place as it is in the novel, and not as a possible dream as the 1939 film implies.&lt;ref&gt;L.

==Production==

===Disney's history with ''Oz''===
After the success of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' in 1937, [[Walt Disney]] planned to produce an animated film based on the first of L. Frank Baum's ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|Oz]]'' books. However, [[Roy O. Disney]], the chairman of [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]], was informed by Baum's estate that they had sold the film rights to the first book to [[Samuel Goldwyn]], who re-sold it to [[Louis B. Mayer]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Angela Lansbury]], narrator, produced by John Fricke and Aljean Harmetz |date=1990 |title=The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the Making of a Movie Classic |trans-title= |medium=Television |language= |url= |access-date= |archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher=[[CBS]] Television |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was ironically approved due to the success of ''Snow White''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staskiewicz|first1=Keith|title=Hello, Yellow Brick Road|url=http://ew.com/article/2013/03/01/hello-yellow-brick-road/|accessdate=May 12, 2017|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was then developed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) into [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|the well-known musical adaptation]] which was released the following year.

In 1954, when the film rights to Baum's remaining thirteen ''Oz'' books were made available, Walt Disney Productions acquired them&lt;ref name="murchinterview"&gt;{{cite news | first=Bill | last=Chambers  | title=A Conversation: FFC Interviews Academy Award-winning editor Walter Murch | url = http://www.filmfreakcentral.net/ffc/2012/05/a-conversation-ffc-interviews-walter-murch.html | publisher =Film Freak Central |  accessdate = January 13, 2010 | archivedate = February 18, 2013 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6EXGYCKkE | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use in Walt Disney's television series ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Disneyland]]'' which led to the live-action film ''[[Rainbow Road to Oz]]'', which was abandoned and never completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hill | first = Jim | title = Disney's long, long journey to Oz | url = http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2006/11/03/6565.aspx | publisher = Jim Hill Media | accessdate = July 13, 2012 | archivedate= March 7, 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130307025232/http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2006/11/03/6565.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney's history with the ''Oz'' series continued with the 1985 film ''[[Return to Oz]]'', which performed poorly, both critically and commercially,&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F03EFD91039F932A15755C0A963948260 | title=Film: A New 'Oz' Gives Dorothy New Friends | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = June 21, 1985 | accessdate = January 14, 2012 | last=Maslin | first = Janet }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Disasters Outnumber Movie Hits|publisher= [[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1985-09-04/features/8502060585_1_ticket-million-box-office|accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Dave | last=Kehr | title=Return to Oz | url =http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/return-to-oz/Film?oid=1073337 | work = [[Chicago Reader]] | accessdate = January 13, 2010  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121011204033/http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/return-to-oz/Film?oid=1073337 | archivedate= October 11, 2012 | deadurl =no}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has developed a [[cult following]] since its release by fans of the books who considered it a more faithful adaptation to the ''Oz'' books than the 1939 classic.&lt;ref name="Geraghty"&gt;{{cite book | last =Geraghty | first =Lincoln | title =American Hollywood | publisher = Intellect Books | year =2011 | id = | isbn =978-1-84150-415-5| page =187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.etonline.com/movies/131252_Return_to_Oz_Flashback_with_Fairuza_Balk/index.html?viewFull=true | title=Flashback Exclusive: A 'Return to Oz'|date = March 5, 2013 | accessdate = March 15, 2013 | work = ET Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Return to Oz'', Disney lost the film rights to the ''Oz'' books and they were subsequently reverted to the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name="dl"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jr|first1=Mike Fleming|title=Sam Raimi Commits To Disney 'Oz' Take, While 'Rabbit Hole' Scribe Will Rewrite|url=http://deadline.com/2010/10/disneys-oz-pic-gets-sam-raimi-to-commit-rabbit-hole-scribe-to-rewrite-73026/|accessdate=September 22, 2013 |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Screenwriter Mitchell Kapner was intrigued by the prospect of exploring the origins of the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]] character which he discussed in many meetings. After ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' came out, Kapner felt he missed his window of opportunity.&lt;ref name=THRFeb2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Galloway|first=Stephen|title='Oz's' Journey: 3 Studio Chiefs, Multi-Ethnic Munchkins, James Franco Scores $7 Million|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oz-great-powerful-disneys-200-424526?page=show|accessdate=March 7, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Kapner met with [[Joe Roth]], who turned down his current pitches, request any other ideas he had. The discussion turned to what Kapner was reading which he indicated he was reading the Oz series to his kids. Roth was interested as he only knew about the first book. Kapner went through the plot of the novels, when Roth stopped him on the sixth novel in the series, ''[[The Emerald City of Oz]]'', which had some of back story of the Wizard.&lt;ref name="Huff"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Jim|title=Joe Roth Reflects on Oz The Great and Powerful, Looks Forward to Maleficent in 2014|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-hill/joe-roth-reflects-on-oz-t_b_2806542.html|accessdate=March 5, 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Joe Roth]] became involved for nearly the same reason as Kapner, stating that "…&amp;nbsp;during the years that I spent running Walt Disney Studios—I learned about how hard it was to find a fairy tale with a good strong male protagonist.

But a fairy tale with a male protagonist is very hard to come by. But with the origin story of the Wizard of Oz, here was a fairy tale story with a natural male protagonist.

Screenwriter Kapner adopted information about the Wizard from L. Frank Baum's novels to conceptualize an original story.

In June 2011, composer [[Danny Elfman]] was hired to score ''Oz the Great and Powerful'' despite Elfman and Raimi having had a falling-out over ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' and Elfman declaring that they would never again work together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chud.com/4718/elfman-vs-raimi-round-ii/ | title = Elfman vs. Raimi: Round II | first= Devin | last = Faraci | first2= Daniel Robert | last2=Epstein | date= October 13, 2005 | publisher= Chud.com | accessdate = February 17, 2013 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6EVleQIGk | archivedate = February 17, 2013 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] for ''Oz the Great and Powerful'' began July 25, 2011, at [[Motown Motion Picture Studios|Raleigh Michigan Studios]] in [[Pontiac, Michigan]], employing 3D cameras.&lt;ref name="35-SlashFilm" /&gt;

Art director [[Robert Stromberg]], who worked on ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' and ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', drew inspiration from the films of [[Frank Capra]] and [[James Wong Howe]] to achieve the [[Art Deco]] design he envisioned for the [[Emerald City]]. Stromberg contrasted the colorful tonal qualities of ''Oz'' with the restrained appearance of ''Alice'', affirming that although both films explore similar fantasy worlds, the overall atmosphere and landscape of each "are completely different."&lt;ref name="LATStromberg"&gt;{{cite news|last=McIntyre|first=Gina|title='Oz: The Great and Powerful': Robert Stromberg on Raimi, Burton, Baum|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/oz-the-great-and-powerful-robert-stromberg-on-raimi-burton-baum/#/0|accessdate=March 7, 2013|quote=If you really broke it down, they're completely different.

Although the film is a spiritual prequel to the 1939 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', it was not allowed legally to be considered as such. The filmmakers had to toe a fine line between calling the film to mind but not [[Copyright infringement|infringing]] upon it. To that end, Disney had a copyright expert on set to ensure no infringement occurred. The production team worked under the constraint of abiding by the stipulations set forth by [[Warner Bros.]], the legal owner of the rights to iconic elements of the 1939 film (via its [[Turner Entertainment]] sister company which purchased the MGM film library in 1986), including the [[ruby slippers]] worn by [[Judy Garland]]. Therefore, Disney was unable to use them nor any original character likenesses from the 1939 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zeitchik|first=Steven|title=No place like Oz?

While Warner and Disney did not engage in copyright battle, they did file rival trademarks. In October 2012, Disney filed a trademark on "Oz the Great and Powerful" while one week later Warner filed its own trademarks for "The Great and Powerful Oz." The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] suspended Warner's attempt at a trademark because Disney had filed basically the same one a week earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/wizard-of-oz-disney-warner-bros-289305|title=Disney, Warner Bros.

In addition to the legal issues, the film was also faced with delays when several cast members went on hiatus due to unrelated commitments and circumstances. [[Rachel Weisz]] left halfway through the shoot to film her entire role in ''[[The Bourne Legacy (film)|The Bourne Legacy]]'', [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] was required to promote the release of ''[[My Week with Marilyn]]'' and Franco's father died during production.

===Music===
Composer [[Danny Elfman]] noted that the film's score was accessibly quick to produce, with a majority of the music being written in six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McIntyre|first=Gina|title='Oz': Teaser, character posters hint at Sam Raimi's lavish vision|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2013/01/29/oz-teaser-character-posters-hint-at-sam-raimis-lavish-vision/#/0|accessdate=January 31, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 29, 2013 | archivedate = February 18, 2013 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6EXK8rfk5 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the tonal quality of the score, Elfman stated, "We're going to take an approach that's old school but not self-consciously old-fashioned. Let the melodrama be melodrama, let everything be what it is. I also think there's the advantage that I'm able to write narratively, and when I'm able to write narratively I can also move quicker because that's my natural instincts, I can tell a story in the music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McIntyre|first=Gina|title=Composing wizard Danny Elfman talks sweeping, gigantic 'Oz' score|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2013/01/10/danny-elfman-oz-score/#/0|accessdate=January 31, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Oz the Great and Powerful'' received an approval rating of 60% based on 253 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "It suffers from some tonal inconsistency and a deflated sense of wonder, but ''Oz the Great and Powerful'' still packs enough visual dazzle and clever wit to be entertaining in its own right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/oz_the_great_and_powerful/ |title= Oz the Great and Powerful (2013) |publisher= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date= January 5, 2017 |accessdate= March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] the film holds a score of 44 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating "mixed to average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/oz-the-great-and-powerful |title= Oz the Great and Powerful reviews|publisher= [[Metacritic]] |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kim Newman]], writing for ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and said, "If there are post-[[Harry Potter]] children who don't know or care about ''The Wizard Of Oz'', they might be at sea with this story about a not-very-nice grownup in a magic land, but long-term Oz watchers will be enchanted and enthralled&amp;nbsp;… Mila Kunis gets a gold star for excellence in bewitchery and Sam Raimi can settle securely behind the curtain as a mature master of illusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=137178 |author= Newman, Kim |authorlink= Kim Newman |date= March 2013 |title= 'Oz The Great and Powerful' |work= [[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate= March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Alonso Duralde also admired the movie: "That ''Oz the Great and Powerful'' is so thoroughly effective both on its own terms and as a prequel to one of the most beloved movies ever made indicates that this team has magic to match any witch or wizard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/oz-great-and-powerful-review-sam-raimi-manages-fill-some-mighty-big-ruby-slippers-80141|author= Duralde, Alonso |date= March 5, 2013 |title= ''Oz the Great and Powerful'' Review: Sam Raimi Manages to Fill Some Mighty Big Ruby Slippers |publisher= The Wrap |accessdate= March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]] on ''[[IndieWire]]'' claimed that "No movie ever can, or will, replace 1939's ''The Wizard Of Oz'', but taken on its own terms, this eye-filling fantasy is an entertaining riff on how the Wizard of that immortal film found his way to Oz."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.indiewire.com/leonardmaltin/oz-the-great-and-powerful |author= Maltin, Leonard |authorlink= Leonard Maltin |date= March 2013 |title= 'Oz the Great and Powerful' |publisher= [[IndieWire]] |accessdate= March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] rated the film 7.8 and said, "The film is expansive and larger-than-life in scope and so are the performances, overall. Franco in particular hams it up and is often playing to the balcony&amp;nbsp;… The 3D is utilized just as it should be in a children's fantasy epic such as this – overtly, but with skill. Snowflakes, music boxes and mysterious animals all leap through the screen towards the audience as the story unfolds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/04/oz-the-great-and-powerful-review |author= Cornet, Roth |date= March 4, 2013 |title= Who is a Good Witch, What is a Great Wizard? |publisher= IGN |accessdate= March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' had a mixed reaction, writing that the film "gets some mileage out of its game performances, luscious production design and the unfettered enthusiasm director Sam Raimi brings to a thin, simplistic origin story."&lt;ref name=JChang&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Justin|title=Film Review: 'Oz the Great and Powerful'|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-oz-the-great-and-powerful-820799/|accessdate=March 6, 2013|newspaper=Variety|date=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also compared the film's scale with the [[Star Wars|''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy]] adding, "In a real sense, ''Oz the Great and Powerful'' has a certain kinship with [[George Lucas]]'s ''Star Wars'' prequels, in the way it presents a beautiful but borderline-sterile digital update of a world that was richer, purer and a lot more fun in lower-tech form. Here, too, the actors often look artificially superimposed against their CG backdrops, though the intensity of the fakery generates its own visual fascination."&lt;ref name=JChang/&gt; [[/Film]] rated the film 7 out of 10, saying it had "many charms" while considering it to be "basically ''[[Army of Darkness]]'': (Normal guy lands in magical land, is forced to go on quest to save that land.) But just when you see Raimi's kinetic, signature style starting to unleash, the story forces the film back into its Disney shell to play to the masses. We're left with a film that's entertaining, a little scarier than you'd expect, but extremely inconsistent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slashfilm.com/oz-the-great-and-powerful-review-a-sam-raimi-movie-wrapped-inside-a-disney-movie/ |author= Lussier, Germain |date= March 5, 2013 |title= ''Oz the Great and Powerful'' Review: A Sam Raimi Movie Wrapped Inside a Disney Movie |publisher= [[/Film]] |accessdate= March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Roeper]], writing for [[Roger Ebert]], noted the film's omnipresent visual effects but was largely disappointed by the performance of some cast members; "…&amp;nbsp;to see Williams so bland and sugary as Glinda, and Kunis so flat and ineffectual as the heartsick Theodora&amp;nbsp;…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roeper|first=Richard|title=Oz the Great and Powerful review - Wicked or wussy: Which witch is worse?|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130306/REVIEWS/130309990|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=March 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marshall Fine]] of ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'' was unimpressed, writing, "Oh, it's exciting enough for a six-year-old; anyone older, however, will already have been exposed to so much on TV, at the movies and on the Internet that this will seem like so much visual cotton-candy. Even a sophisticated grade-schooler will find these doings weak and overblown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Fine, Marshall |date= March 4, 2013 |title= Movie Review: ''Oz, the Great and Powerful'' |work= Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Todd McCarthy]] criticized the characterization, writing that the film's supporting cast "can't begin to compare with their equivalents in the original&amp;nbsp;… so the burden rests entirely upon Franco and Williams, whose dialogue exchanges are repetitive and feel tentative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|title=Oz the Great and Powerful: Film Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/oz-great-powerful/review/425417|accessdate=March 6, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' agreed, giving the film a C+ and saying that the "miscast" Franco "lacks the humor, charm, and gee-whiz wonder we're meant to feel as he trades wisecracks with a flying monkey&amp;nbsp;… and soars above a field of poppies in a giant soap bubble. If ''he''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s not enchanted, how are ''we'' supposed to be?" and complaining that "while Raimi's Oz is like retinal [[Crack cocaine|crack]], he never seduces our hearts and minds."&lt;ref name="EW" /&gt; Alisha Coelho of [[in.com]] gave the movie 2.5 stars, saying "''Oz The Great and Powerful'' doesn't leave a lasting impression, but is an a-ok watch."&lt;ref name="Movie Review: Oz the Great &amp; Powerful is a-ok"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.com/news/entertainment/movie-review-oz-the-great-powerful-is-aok-50192564-in-1.html| title=Movie Review: Oz the Great &amp; Powerful is a-ok | author=Alisha Coelho | publisher=in.com| accessdate=March 5, 2013}}{{Rating|2.5|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment==

In the 1940s and 1950s, Philadelphia was an important pop music center, with many bands and singers being made or broken in the city.&lt;ref name="funsy"&gt;

Well beyond the club’s heyday, the restaurant remained popular. Sinatra visited the “black tie saloon” frequently&lt;ref name="funsy" /&gt; and Mayor [[Frank Rizzo]] spent most evenings there during his rise to power, years in office and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;

The banquet hall became a popular cultural tradition for many social groups, business organizations, family celebrations, and special events that were mostly attracted by the reasonable prices, menu items and entertainment. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1310">A '''pasindhèn''' (informally '''sindhèn'''; also called '''waranggana''') is a female solo singer who sings with a [[gamelan]]. They may perform in unaccompanied music, dance, or [[wayang]] performances.

The pesindhèn may sing together with a [[gerong]] (male chorus), but their styles and words will be different. The part of the sindhen is largely improvised within strict parameters (similar to instrumental [[cengkok]]). The sindhen is also allowed a much freer rhythm, similar to the [[rebab]] and [[suling]], instead of the strict rhythm of the gerong.

'''Sindhen''' can also refer to the choir of male and female singers used to accompany the [[bedhaya]] and [[serimpi]] court dances. In this usage, ''pesindhen'' refers to the individual members of the choir.

"'''Return of the King'''" is the ninth episode of the [[The Boondocks (season 1)|first season]] of the [[animated television series]] ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]''. It originally aired in the [[United States]] on [[Cartoon Network|Cartoon Network's]] late-night programming block [[Adult Swim]] on January 15, 2006. The episode's name was taken from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' volume ''[[The Return of the King]]''. It won a [[Peabody Award]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-boondocks-the-return-of-the-king 66th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

The episode begins with two quotes, the first being:

{{quote|I want young men and young women who are not alive today to know and see that these new privileges and opportunities did not come without somebody suffering and sacrificing for them.|[[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]]}}

And the second:

{{quote|Whatever, nigga.|[[Anonymous work|Anonymous]]}}

[[Huey Freeman]] tells an alternate version of history regarding the "attempted" [[Martin Luther King, Jr.#Assassination|assassination]] of Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 4, 1968 King is shot and critically wounded. Instead of dying, he falls into a [[coma]] in which he remains for 32 years, waking up significantly aged in a hospital bed on October 27, 2000. He shows up to vote for the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. presidential election]], but is "turned away due to [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000#Recount irregularities|voting irregularity]]". While walking along a city street which happened to bear his name, gunshots go off, causing the gathered crowd to flee. He thus learns that "streets named after him weren't the very safest."

King experiences a resurgence of popularity, obtaining a book deal and agreeing to a [[Biographical film|biopic]] of his life (starring [[Cuba Gooding, Jr.]] as King). The movie is directed by [[Oliver Stone]], "pissing off" [[Spike Lee]] (a reference to Lee's anger that [[Norman Jewison]] was initially supposed to direct ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]''). Unfortunately, the movie is released the week after the [[September 11 attacks]], making it a [[Box office bomb|flop]]. Soon after, King appears on ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'', stating that his [[Christianity|Christian]] faith teaches him to "[[turn the other cheek]]", even with respect to enemies such as [[Al-Qaeda]].  His commentary receives severe scorn from the [[White House Press Secretary]], [[CNN]] and [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], and causes his popularity to plummet.

At his vacant [[book signing]], King meets Huey and Robert Freeman, the latter of whom he became acquainted with during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] (it is later revealed in the episode that Robert Freeman participated in the [[Montgomery bus boycott]] with [[Rosa Parks]], but was completely ignored). Robert prank calls Rosa Parks out of retaliation. Learning that he is staying in a [[Holiday Inn Express]], the Freemans invite Dr. King to dinner and to sleep at their house. Riley rudely disrespects Dr. King during dinner (not knowing who he is and mistaking him for [[Morgan Freeman]]) and thus earns a spanking from Robert. Riley hates Dr. King even more while being spanked. Later that night, Huey and King, while watching television, express their disgust and disappointment with the state of black popular culture. When King asks Huey what happened to African American society, Huey responds by saying that everyone was waiting for King to return, as without strong leaders like him, the entire culture plummeted.

The next day, Huey persuades King to try to reach out to the public again.  While eating at a McWuncler's, a parody of [[McDonald's]] (where King guiltily admits to having an affinity for the [[McRib]]), Huey convinces him that the two of them should start a [[political party]], although King is insistent that Huey should get [[Oprah Winfrey]] to do so instead. King appears on a television show to explain the philosophy of his new party, but finds himself unable to expound due to frequent interruptions from the fast-talking, curt, [[Tucker Carlson#Public image|bowtie-wearing]] right-wing host (voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]]). Right before a commercial break, Huey rushes the stage after throwing a chair at the host, beating him on camera. Afterwards, King and Huey settle on spreading their message the old-fashioned way: through flyers and door-to-door solicitation.

The goal of their party is further disrupted when King hires an "urban [[Promoter (entertainment)|promotions]] firm" to advertise the party's planning meeting, which advertises it on an [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] [[pop music]] station as a "party." As a result, dozens of young black people arrive at the [[Church (building)|church]] and begin behaving as though it were a club. A [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] (voiced by [[DJ Pooh]]) prevents Huey and King's entrance, insisting that they must bribe him, which they do. Upon entering, they are stunned by the unrestrained behavior of the reveling crowd and are shocked to find that the podium has been taken over by a series of [[Rapping|rappers]], [[Televangelism|televangelists]], and other superficial black pop culture icons. King, managing to get to the podium, tries to quiet the crowd by appealing to the audience's sense of brotherhood. He fails. Suddenly becoming fiercely impassioned, he proclaims, "Will you ignorant [[nigga]]s please shut the hell up?!" The crowd is shocked.

King then goes on to ask: "Is this it? ''This'' is what I got all those ass-whoopings for?" He continues to refer to the audience repeatedly as "niggas" out of apparent frustration that the current generation of black people have willfully assumed the negative racial stereotypes associated with them. He goes on a tirade, attacking specific elements of black popular culture such as [[Black Entertainment Television]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], and ''[[Soul Plane]]''. King concludes his speech by saying, "I've seen what's around the corner, I've seen what's over the horizon, and I promise you, you niggas have nothing to celebrate! And no, I won't get there with you. I'm going to [[Canada]]."

King thanks Huey, advising him to "do what he can" and leaves. This was the last time Huey ever saw King. Media exposure of his speech causes black citizens to become angry with their situation, creating an uprising similar to those of the 1960s. The episode concludes with several news reports that all black members of the [[NBA]] are sitting the season out until "troops are withdrawn", that drop-out rates among African-American youths have suddenly plummeted, and that [[Robert L. Johnson]] issued a public apology for founding BET. The next scene shows young black men and women screaming at the gates of the [[White House]], cursing an unnamed presidential administration. Finally, the front page of a newspaper from 2020 is shown, revealing that King has died in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] at the age of 91 and, furthermore, that Oprah Winfrey has been [[United States presidential election, 2020|elected]] [[President of the United States]].

Huey concludes the episode with these words: "It's fun to dream", stating that this whole episode was Huey's interpretation as to what would happen if MLK Jr. have lived instead of being assassinated in '68.

==Controversy==
"Return of the King" was the most controversial episode of ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'''s first season. The episode received criticism from [[Al Sharpton]] for depicting Martin Luther King Jr. using the term "nigga."&lt;ref name=Cartoon_Network_response&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-01-25-sharpton-boondocks_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA |title=Sharpton criticizes 'Boondocks' for showing King saying the n-word |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2006-01-25 |accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He demanded an apology from [[Aaron McGruder]] and [[Cartoon Network]], stating "Cartoon Network must apologize and also commit to pulling episodes that desecrate black historic figures. We are totally offended by the continuous use of the n-word in McGruder's show."{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Cartoon Network replied by releasing a statement saying, "We think Aaron McGruder came up with a thought-provoking way of not only showing Dr. King's bravery but also of reminding us of what he stood and fought for, and why even today, it is important for all of us to remember that and to continue to take action."&lt;ref name=Cartoon_Network_response /&gt; McGruder himself responded to Sharpton's criticism in [[The Boondocks (comic strip)|''The Boondocks'' comic strip]], by having the characters ridicule the activist's choice to attack a cartoon over other, more relevant issues.

The incident was also referenced on the show, in the episode "[[The Block is Hot]]." While Huey listens to an [[internet radio]] station, the broadcaster mentions that Al Sharpton: "Folks, this heat will not let up, it is hot! Speaking about hot, Al Sharpton is hot right now.  Havin' a big ole protest. Seems his anger again has something to do with... I think it's a cartoon this time..."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6317">The phrase "'''Said the actress to the bishop'''" is a colloquial and vulgar British exclamation, offering humour by serving as a [[punch line]] that exposes an unintended [[double entendre]]. An equivalent phrase in North America is "'''that's what ''she'' said'''".&lt;ref name="tifo"/&gt; Each phrase is an example of a [[Wellerism]], exposing a second meaning of what precedes it. The versatility of such phrases, and their popularity, lead some to consider them [[cliché]]d.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gq.com/blogs/the-q/2010/08/thats-what-she-said-yeah-give-it-a-rest.html "That's What She Said? Yeah, Give It A Rest"] The Verge. ''GQ'' online&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and variations==
The term, or its variant "as the actress said to the bishop", is [[British people|British]] in origin. It was in popular usage in the [[Royal Air Force]] c.1944-47, but may originate from the [[Edwardian era]].&lt;ref name=Partridge&gt;{{cite book |last=Partridge |first=Eric|year=1982|edition=2|title=A Dictionary of Catch Phrases|location=London|publisher=Routledge |page=31 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0U2IAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Said%20the%20actress%20to%20the%20bishop%20origin&amp;pg=PT122#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is frequently used by the fictional character [[Simon Templar]] (alias "The Saint") in a long-running series of mystery books by [[Leslie Charteris]]. The phrase first appears in the inaugural Saint novel ''[[Meet the Tiger]]'', published in 1928.&lt;ref name="tifo"&gt;[http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/12/the-british-equivalent-of-thats-what-she-said/ The British Equivalent of 'That's What She Said'] Today I Found Out&lt;/ref&gt;

The version "as the girl said to the soldier" appears in a recorded sound test for [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1929 film ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]''.&lt;ref name=huffpo&gt;{{cite news |title=Hitchcock's 'That's What She Said' Joke Is Its First Known Recording! (video) |author=Nicholas Graham |date=2010-06-10 |work=The Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/10/hitchcocks-thats-what-she_n_607689.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kingsley Amis]] uses the line in his 1954 novel ''[[Lucky Jim]]'', where a woman offering relationship advice to Jim Dixon says "I can't show you, as the actress said to the bishop."

The title character on the US TV show ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'', after several seasons of using "phrasing!" to draw attention to double entendres, briefly toyed with "...said Ripley to the android Bishop", a reference to both this phrase and the 1986 film ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]].''

== That's what she said! ==
By 1973, "that's what ''she'' said" had already been characterized as an "ancient [[one-line joke|one-liner]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Edmond G. |last1=Addeo |first2=Robert E.|last2=Burger|title=EgoSpeak: Why No One Listens to You |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjkBAAAAMAAJ|year=1973 |publisher=[[Chilton Books]] |isbn=0801958938 |accessdate=2012-09-28|quote=The cheapest shot of all, of course, is the ancient one-liner, "That's what ''she'' said " This reply can be used after virtually any remark, however innocent, and the speaker can summon up some hint of double-entendre.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, it was a recurring joke in the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch "[[Wayne's World]]". In the [[Wayne's World (film)|movie of the same name]], the character, Wayne Campbell, uses the phrase after his partner Garth says, "Hey, are you through yet? 'Cause I'm getting tired of holding this", in regard to a picture he is holding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Corey|last=Spring|url=http://spring.newsvine.com/_news/2007/02/15/569781-international-thats-what-she-said-day |title=International 'That's What she Said' Day |website=[[Newsvine]] |date=February 15, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070217030446/http://spring.newsvine.com/_news/2007/02/15/569781-international-thats-what-she-said-day |archivedate=February 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 1896 recording by [[Len Spencer]] of the song "[[All Coons Look Alike to Me]]" includes the suggestive line{{or?|date=October 2015}} "That's what she said, yeah."&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/LenSpencer-01-10&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original [[BBC]] version of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'', [[Ricky Gervais]]'s character [[David Brent]] frequently used the phrase "as the actress said to the bishop" as an inappropriate joke. When the show was adapted for American audiences, also under the title "[[The Office (U.S. TV Series)|The Office]]", the phrase was translated to "that's what she said" for [[Steve Carell]]'s character [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]]. "That's what she said" (with an emphasis on the word "she") became a [[catchphrase]] of ''The Office'' and was used for the show's "That's What She Said" Sweepstakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Office US|title=Every That's What She Said Ever  - The Office US|date=2017-07-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClzJkv3dpY8&amp;t=8s|accessdate=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-office/the-office-launches-thats-what-34599.aspx The Office Launches 'That's What She Said' Sweepstakes]. Buddy TV.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew R. Meier of West Chester University of Pennsylvania and Christopher A. Medjesky of the University of Findlay have argued that "such off-hand, common remarks such as “that’s what she said” jokes are deeply entrenched in modern society, and contribute to humorizing and legitimizing sexual misconduct."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=180837&amp;CultureCode=en Do commonplace jokes normalize sexual misconduct experiences?]. AlphaGalileo 13 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the terminology was used again in ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' by [[Alec Baldwin]] who portrayed [[Donald Trump]] in "Paul Manafort's House Cold Open": "'I would never do that to you.' 'That's what she said.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Saturday Night Live|title=Paul Manafort's House Cold Open - SNL|date=2017-11-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spkfIpPmPgs&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Barclay Beckett''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|k|ɪ|t}}; 13 April 1906 – 22 December 1989) was an Irish [[avant-garde]] novelist, playwright, theatre director, poet, and literary translator who lived in [[Paris]] for most of his adult life. He wrote in both English and French.

Beckett's work offers a bleak, [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] outlook on human existence, often coupled with [[black comedy]] and gallows humor, and became increasingly [[Minimalism|minimalist]] in his later career. He is considered one of the last [[Modernism|modernist]] writers, and one of the key figures in what [[Martin Esslin]] called the "[[Theatre of the Absurd]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cakirtas, O. Developmental Psychology Rediscovered: Negative Identity and Ego Integrity vs. Despair in Samuel Beckett's Endgame. International Journal of Language Academy.Volume 2/2 Summer  2014 p. 194/203. http://www.ijla.net/Makaleler/1990731560_13.%20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckett was awarded the 1969 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] "for his writing, which—in new forms for the novel and drama—in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1969|publisher=Nobelprize|date=7 October 2010|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1969/|accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected [[Saoi]] of [[Aosdána]] in 1984.

==Early life and education==
Samuel Beckett was born in Dublin on [[Good Friday]], 13 April 1906, to William Frank Beckett, a [[quantity surveyor]] and descendant of the [[Huguenots]], and Maria Jones Roe, a nurse, when both were 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagi-nation.com/moonstruck/clsc7.htm |title=Samuel beckett -1906-1989 |publisher=Imagi-nation.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had married in 1901. Beckett had one older brother, Frank Edward Beckett (1902–1954). At the age of five, Beckett attended a local playschool in Dublin, where he started to learn music, and then moved to Earlsfort House School in Dublin city centre near Harcourt Street. The Becketts were members of the Anglican [[Church of Ireland]]. The family home, Cooldrinagh in the [[Dublin]] suburb of [[Foxrock]], was a large house and garden complete with tennis court built in 1903 by Samuel's father, William. The house and garden, together with the surrounding countryside where he often went walking with his father, the nearby [[Leopardstown Racecourse]], the Foxrock railway station and  Harcourt Street station at the city terminus of the line, all feature in his prose and plays.

In 1919/1920, Beckett went to [[Portora Royal School]] in [[Enniskillen]], [[County Fermanagh]] (which [[Oscar Wilde]] had also attended). He left 3 years later, in 1923. A natural athlete, Beckett excelled at cricket as a left-handed batsman and a left-arm medium-pace bowler. Later, he was to play for [[Dublin University Cricket Club|Dublin University]] and played two [[first-class cricket|first-class]] games against [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]].&lt;ref name="wisden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ireland/content/player/24553.html|title=Samuel Beckett|website=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he became the only Nobel literature laureate to have played first-class cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154150.html|title=Never a famous cricketer|last=Rice|first=Jonathan|year=2001|website=Wisden|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckett studied French, Italian, and English at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] from 1923 to 1927 (one of his tutors was the eminent [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] scholar [[A. A. Luce]], who introduced him to the work of [[Henri Bergson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Colangelo|first1=Jeremy|title=Nothing is Impossible: Bergson, Beckett, and the Pursuit of the Naught|journal=Journal of Modern Literature|date=2017|volume=40|issue=4|page=39|doi=10.2979/jmodelite.40.4.03|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/671605|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). He was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College, Dublin|elected a Scholar]] in Modern Languages in 1926. Beckett graduated with a BA and, after teaching briefly at [[Campbell College]] in Belfast, took up the post of ''lecteur d'anglais'' at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris from November 1928 to 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerley and Gontarski, ''Grove Companion to Samuel Beckett'', 161&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he was introduced to renowned Irish author [[James Joyce]] by [[Thomas MacGreevy]], a poet and close confidant of Beckett who also worked there. This meeting had a profound effect on the young man. Beckett assisted Joyce in various ways, one of which was research towards the book that became ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson (1997) p106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Beckett published his first work, a critical essay entitled "Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce".&lt;!-- sic! those periods are correct! See "An exagmination of James Joyce", page 3 --&gt; The essay defends Joyce's work and method, chiefly from allegations of wanton obscurity and dimness, and was Beckett's contribution to ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]'' (a book of essays on Joyce which also included contributions by [[Eugene Jolas]], [[Robert McAlmon]], and [[William Carlos Williams]]). Beckett's close relationship with Joyce and his family cooled, however, when he rejected the advances of Joyce's daughter [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]] owing to her progressing [[schizophrenia]]. Beckett's first short story, "Assumption", was published in Jolas's periodical [[Transition (literary journal)|''transition'']]. The next year he won a small literary prize for his hastily composed poem "Whoroscope", which draws on a biography of [[René Descartes]] that Beckett happened to be reading when he was encouraged to submit.

In 1930, Beckett returned to Trinity College as a lecturer. In November 1930, he presented a paper in French to the Modern Languages Society of Trinity on the [[Toulouse]] poet Jean du Chas, founder of a movement called ''le Concentrisme''. It was a literary parody, for Beckett had in fact invented the poet and his movement that claimed to be "at odds with all that is clear and distinct in [[Descartes]]". Beckett later insisted that he had not intended to fool his audience.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Ackerley and S. E. Gontarski, ''The Grove Companion to Samuel Beckett'' (New York: Grove Press, 2004), 108.&lt;/ref&gt; When Beckett resigned from Trinity at the end of 1931, his brief academic career was at an end. He commemorated it with the poem "Gnome", which was inspired by his reading of [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]'s ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'' and eventually published in ''[[The Dublin Magazine]]'' in 1934:

{{quote|Spend the years of learning squandering&lt;br/&gt;Courage for the years of wandering&lt;br/&gt;Through a world politely turning&lt;br/&gt;From the loutishness of learning&lt;ref&gt;"Gnome" from ''Collected Poems''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Beckett travelled in Europe. He spent some time in London, where in 1931 he published ''[[Proust (Beckett essay)|Proust]]'', his critical study of French author [[Marcel Proust]]. Two years later, following his father's death, he began two years' treatment with [[Tavistock Clinic]] psychoanalyst [[Wilfred Bion|Dr. Wilfred Bion]]. Aspects of it became evident in Beckett's later works, such as ''Watt'' and ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samuel-beckett.net/speople.html Beckett, Samuel. (1906–1989)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014215351/http://samuel-beckett.net/speople.html |date=14 October 2007 }} – Literary Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, he wrote his first novel, ''[[Dream of Fair to Middling Women]]'', but after many rejections from publishers decided to abandon it (it was eventually published in 1992). Despite his inability to get it published, however, the novel served as a source for many of Beckett's early poems, as well as for his first full-length book, the 1933 [[Short story|short-story]] collection ''[[More Pricks Than Kicks]]''.

Beckett published essays and reviews, including "Recent Irish Poetry" (in ''[[The Bookman (literary magazine)|The Bookman]]'', August 1934) and "Humanistic Quietism", a review of his friend Thomas MacGreevy's ''Poems'' (in ''[[The Dublin Magazine]]'', July–September 1934). They focused on the work of MacGreevy, [[Brian Coffey]], [[Denis Devlin]] and [[Blanaid Salkeld]], despite their slender achievements at the time, comparing them favourably with their [[Celtic Revival]] contemporaries and invoking [[Ezra Pound]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and the [[Symbolism (arts)|French symbolists]] as their precursors. In describing these poets as forming "the nucleus of a living poetic in Ireland", Beckett was tracing the outlines of an Irish poetic [[Modernism|modernist]] canon.&lt;ref&gt;''Disjecta'', 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935—the year that Beckett successfully published a book of his poetry, ''Echo's Bones and Other Precipitates''—Beckett worked on his novel ''[[Murphy (novel)|Murphy]]''. In May, he wrote to MacGreevy that he had been reading about film and wished to go to Moscow to study with [[Sergei Eisenstein]] at the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]] in Moscow. In mid-1936 he wrote to Eisenstein and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] to offer himself as their apprentice. Nothing came of this, however, as Beckett's letter was lost owing to Eisenstein's quarantine during the smallpox outbreak, as well as his focus on a script re-write of his postponed film production.  In 1936, a friend had suggested him  to look up the works of [[Arnold Geulincx]], which Beckett did and he took many notes. The philosopher's name is mentioned in ''Murphy'' and the reading apparently left a strong impression.&lt;ref&gt;The notes that Beckett took have been published and commented in ''Notes de Beckett sur Geulincx'' (2012) ed. N. Doutey, Paris: Les Solitaires Intempestifs, {{ISBN|978-2-84681-350-1}} and ''Arnold Geulincx Ethics With Samuel Beckett's Notes'', ed. H. Van Ruler,  Brill Academic Publishers {{ISBN|9789004154674}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Murphy'' was finished in 1936 and Beckett departed for extensive travel around Germany, during which time he filled several notebooks with lists of noteworthy artwork that he had seen and noted his distaste for the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] savagery that was overtaking the country. Returning to Ireland briefly in 1937, he oversaw the publication of ''Murphy'' (1938), which he translated into French the following year. He fell out with his mother, which contributed to his decision to settle permanently in Paris. Beckett remained in Paris following the outbreak of World War II in 1939, preferring, in his own words, "France at war to Ireland at peace".&lt;ref&gt;Israel Shenker, "Moody Man of Letters", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 5 May 1956; quoted in Cronin, 310&lt;/ref&gt; His was soon a known face in and around [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]] cafés, where he strengthened his allegiance with Joyce and forged new ones with artists [[Alberto Giacometti]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], with whom he regularly played [[chess]]. Sometime around December 1937, Beckett had a brief affair with [[Peggy Guggenheim]], who nicknamed him "Oblomov" (after the character in [[Ivan Goncharov]]'s [[Oblomov|novel]]).&lt;ref&gt;This character, she said, was so looed by apathia that he "finally did not even have the willpower to get out of bed"; quoted in Gussow (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1938 in Paris, Beckett was stabbed in the chest and nearly killed when he refused the solicitations of a notorious [[pimp]] (who went by the name of Prudent). Joyce arranged a private room for Beckett at the hospital. The publicity surrounding the stabbing attracted the attention of [[Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil]], who previously knew Beckett slightly from his first stay in Paris. This time, however, the two would begin a lifelong companionship. At a preliminary hearing, Beckett asked his attacker for the motive behind the stabbing. Prudent replied: "Je ne sais pas, Monsieur. Je m'excuse" ["I do not know, sir. I'm sorry"].&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson (1997)  p261&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett eventually dropped the charges against his attacker—partially to avoid further formalities, partly because he found Prudent likeable and well-mannered.

==World War II and French Resistance==
After the Nazi German occupation of France in 1940, Beckett joined the [[French Resistance]], in which he worked as a courier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Blanche/Lettres4 See Samuel Beckett, ''Lettres'', I, 1929-1940, Gallimard, Paris, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; On several occasions over the next two years he was nearly caught by the [[Gestapo]]. In August 1942, his unit was betrayed and he and Suzanne fled south on foot to the safety of the small village of [[Roussillon, Vaucluse|Roussillon]], in the [[Vaucluse]] ''département'' in [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]]. There he continued to assist the Resistance by storing armaments in the back yard of his home. During the two years that Beckett stayed in Roussillon he indirectly helped the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] sabotage the German army in the Vaucluse mountains, though he rarely spoke about his wartime work in later life.&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson (1997) p304–305&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckett was awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de guerre]] and the [[Médaille de la Résistance]] by the French government for his efforts in fighting the German occupation; to the end of his life, however, Beckett would refer to his work with the French Resistance as "boy scout stuff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |title=The Modern Word |publisher=The Modern Word |date= |accessdate=2013-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817072126/http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |archivedate=17 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson (1997)  p303&lt;/ref&gt; While in hiding in Roussillon, he continued work on the novel [[Watt (novel)|''Watt'']] (begun in 1941 and completed in 1945, but not published until 1953, though an extract had appeared in the Dublin literary periodical [[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art|''Envoy'']]).

==Fame: novels and the theatre==
[[File:Samuel Beckett.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Samuel Beckett by [[Reginald Gray (artist)|Reginald Gray]], painted in Paris, 1961 (from the collection of Ken White, Dublin).]]
In 1945, Beckett returned to Dublin for a brief visit. During his stay, he had a revelation in his mother’s room: His entire future direction in literature appeared to him. Beckett had felt that he would remain forever in the shadow of Joyce, certain to never best him at his own game. His revelation prompted him to change direction and to acknowledge both his own stupidity and his interest in ignorance and impotence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I realized that Joyce had gone as far as one could in the direction of knowing more, [being] in control of one’s material. He was always adding to it; you only have to look at his proofs to see that. I realized that my own way was in impoverishment, in lack of knowledge and in taking away, in subtracting rather than in adding."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett, as related by James Knowlson in his biography.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Knowlson argues that "Beckett was rejecting the Joycean principle that knowing more was a way of creatively understanding the world and controlling it ... In future, his work would focus on poverty, failure, exile and loss – as he put it, on man as a 'non-knower' and as a 'non-can-er.'"&lt;ref Name = "Knowlson-p352"/&gt; The revelation "has rightly been regarded as a pivotal moment in his entire career". Beckett fictionalised the experience in his play ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]'' (1958). While listening to a tape he made earlier in his life, Krapp hears his younger self say "clear to me at last that the dark I have always struggled to keep under is in reality my most...", at which point Krapp fast-forwards the tape (before the audience can hear the complete revelation). Beckett later explained to Knowlson that the missing words on the tape are "precious ally".&lt;ref Name = "Knowlson-p352"&gt;Knowlson (1997) p352–353.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]’s magazine ''Les Temps modernes'' published the first part of Beckett’s short story "''Suite''" (later to be called "''La Fin''", or "The End"), not realizing that Beckett had only submitted the first half of the story; [[Simone de Beauvoir]] refused to publish the second part. Beckett also began to write his fourth novel, [[Mercier and Camier|''Mercier et Camier'']], which was not published until 1970. The novel presaged his most famous work, the play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', which was written not long afterwards. More importantly, the novel was Beckett’s first long work that he wrote in French, the language of most of his subsequent works which were strongly supported by [[Jérôme Lindon]] director of his parisian publishing house [[Les Éditions de Minuit]], including the [[poioumenon]] "trilogy" of novels: [[Molloy (novel)|''Molloy'']] (1951); ''Malone meurt'' (1951), ''[[Malone Dies]]'' (1958); ''L'innommable'' (1953), ''[[the Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]'' (1960). Despite being a native English speaker, Beckett wrote in French because—as he himself claimed—it was easier for him thus to write "without style".&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson (1997) p324&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samuel Beckett 01-2.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Portrait, circa 1970]]
Beckett is most famous for his play ''[[Waiting for Godot|En attendant Godot]]'' (1953) (''[[Waiting for Godot]]''). In a much-quoted article, the critic [[Vivian Mercier]] wrote that Beckett "has achieved a theoretical impossibility—a play in which nothing happens, that yet keeps audiences glued to their seats. What's more, since the second act is a subtly different reprise of the first, he has written a play in which nothing happens, twice."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Irish Times]]'', 18 February 1956, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of his works after 1947, the play was first written in French with the title ''En attendant Godot''. Beckett worked on the play between October 1948 and January 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson (1997) p342&lt;/ref&gt; He published it in 1952 and it premièred in 1953; an English translation appeared two years later. Directed by [[Roger Blin]], the play was a critical, popular, and controversial success in Paris. It opened in London in 1955 to mainly negative reviews, but the tide turned with positive reactions from Harold Hobson in ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' and, later, [[Kenneth Tynan]]. In the United States, it flopped in [[Miami]] and had a qualified success in New York City. After this, the play became extremely popular, with highly successful performances in the US and Germany. It is frequently performed today.

Beckett translated all of his works into English himself, with the exception of ''Molloy'', for which he collaborated with Patrick Bowles. The success of ''Waiting for Godot'' opened up a career in theatre for its author. Beckett went on to write successful full-length plays, including ''Fin de partie'' (''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'') (1957), ''Krapp's Last Tape'' (1958, written in English), ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]'' (1961, also written in English), and ''[[Play (play)|Play]]'' (1963). In 1961, Beckett received the International Publishers' Formentor Prize in recognition of his work, which he shared that year with [[Jorge Luis Borges]].

==Later life and death==
[[File:Beckett-grave-paris.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Samuel Beckett at the Cimetière de [[Montparnasse]]]]
The 1960s were a time of change for Beckett, both on a personal level and as a writer. In 1961, he married Suzanne in a secret civil ceremony in England (its secrecy due to reasons relating to French inheritance law). The success of his plays led to invitations to attend rehearsals and productions around the world, leading eventually to a new career as a theatre director. In 1957, he had his first commission from the [[BBC Third Programme]] for a radio play, ''[[All That Fall]].'' He continued writing sporadically for radio and extended his scope to include cinema and television. He began to write in English again, although he also wrote in French until the end of his life.

Beckett bought some land in 1953 near a hamlet around {{convert|60|km|mi|-1}} northeast of Paris and built a cottage for himself with the help of some locals.

From the late 1950s until his death, Beckett had a relationship with [[Barbara Bray]], a widow who worked as a script editor for the [[BBC]]. Knowlson wrote of them: "She was small and attractive, but, above all, keenly intelligent and well-read. Beckett seems to have been immediately attracted by her and she to him. Their encounter was highly significant for them both, for it represented the beginning of a relationship that was to last, in parallel with that with Suzanne, for the rest of his life."&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson (1997) p458-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Bray died in [[Edinburgh]] on 25 February 2010.
[[File:"Samuel Beckett" by Javad Alizadeh.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature of Samuel Beckett by [[Javad Alizadeh]]]]
In October 1969 while on holiday in [[Tunis]] with Suzanne, Beckett heard that he had won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. Anticipating that her intensely private husband would be saddled with fame from that moment on, Suzanne called the award a "catastrophe".&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson (1998) p505.&lt;/ref&gt; In true ascetic fashion, he gave away all of the prize money. While Beckett did not devote much time to interviews, he sometimes met the artists, scholars, and admirers who sought him out in the anonymous lobby of the Hotel PLM St. Jacques in Paris near his Montparnasse home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |title='&amp;#39;Happiest moment of the past half million: Beckett Biography'&amp;#39; |publisher=Themodernword.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817072126/http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |archivedate=17 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Beckett was an intensely private man, a review of the second volume of his letters by Roy Foster in the 15 December 2011 issue of ''The New Republic'' reveals Beckett to be not only unexpectedly amiable but frequently prepared to talk about his work and the process behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Foster | first = Roy | title = Darkness and Kindness | url = http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/97767/beckett-letters-godot-ireland?passthru=YWEzNjliOWUzNTZhNGRmNGQ4MDMwZmNkOTVjYmY2M2E | work = The New Republic | date = 15 December 2011 | accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzanne died on 17 July 1989. Confined to a nursing home and suffering from [[emphysema]] and possibly [[Parkinson's disease]], Beckett died on 22 December. The two were interred together in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]] in Paris and share a simple granite gravestone that follows Beckett's directive that it should be "any colour, so long as it's grey".

==Works==
[[File:Samuel Beckett by Edmund S. Valtman ppmsc.07951.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Caricature of Beckett by [[Edmund S. Valtman]]]]  
Beckett's career as a writer can be roughly divided into three periods: his early works, up until the end of World War II in 1945; his middle period, stretching from 1945 until the early 1960s, during which he wrote what are probably his best-known works; and his late period, from the early 1960s until Beckett's death in 1989, during which his works tended to become shorter and his style more [[Minimalism|minimalist]].

===Early works===
Beckett's earliest works are generally considered to have been strongly influenced by the work of his friend James Joyce. They are erudite and seem to display the author's learning merely for its own sake, resulting in several obscure passages. The opening phrases of the short-story collection ''[[More Pricks than Kicks]]'' (1934) affords a representative sample of this style:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was morning and Belacqua was stuck in the first of the canti in the moon. He was so bogged that he could move neither backward nor forward. Blissful Beatrice was there, Dante also, and she explained the spots on the moon to him. She shewed him in the first place where he was at fault, then she put up her own explanation. She had it from God, therefore he could rely on its being accurate in every particular.&lt;ref&gt;''More Pricks than Kicks'', 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The passage makes reference to [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy|Commedia]]'', which can serve to confuse readers not familiar with that work. It also anticipates aspects of Beckett's later work: the physical inactivity of the character Belacqua; the character's immersion in his own head and thoughts; the somewhat irreverent comedy of the final sentence.

Similar elements are present in Beckett's first published novel, ''Murphy'' (1938), which also explores the themes of insanity and chess (both of which would be recurrent elements in Beckett's later works). The novel's opening sentence hints at the somewhat pessimistic undertones and [[Black comedy|black]] [[Gallows humor|humour]] that animate many of Beckett's works: "The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new".&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; ''Watt'', written while Beckett was in hiding in Roussillon during World War II, is similar in terms of themes but less exuberant in its style. It explores human movement as if it were a [[permutation|mathematical permutation]], presaging Beckett's later preoccupation—in both his novels and dramatic works—with precise movement.

Beckett's 1930 essay ''[[Proust (Beckett essay)|Proust]]'' was strongly influenced by [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s pessimism and laudatory descriptions of saintly asceticism. At this time Beckett began to write creatively in the French language. In the late 1930s, he wrote a number of short poems in that language and their sparseness—in contrast to the density of his English poems of roughly the same period, collected in ''Echo's Bones and Other Precipitates'' (1935)—seems to show that Beckett, albeit through the medium of another language, was in process of simplifying his style, a change also evidenced in ''Watt''.

&lt;/poem&gt; |source =From ''[[Watt (novel)|Watt]]'' (1953)&lt;ref&gt;''Watt'' by Beckett quoted in: Booth, Wayne C. (1975)  A rhetoric of irony By Wayne C. Booth Chicago University Press p258 {{ISBN|0-226-06553-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
After World War II, Beckett turned definitively to the French language as a vehicle. It was this, together with the "revelation" experienced in his mother's room in Dublin—in which he realized that his art must be subjective and drawn wholly from his own inner world—that would result in the works for which Beckett is best remembered today.

During the 15 years following the war, Beckett produced four major full-length stage plays: ''En attendant Godot'' (written 1948–1949; ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''), ''Fin de partie'' (1955–1957; ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]''), ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]'' (1958), and ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]'' (1961). These plays—which are often considered, rightly or wrongly, to have been instrumental in the so-called "[[Theatre of the Absurd]]"—deal in a [[black comedy|darkly humorous]] way with themes similar to those of the roughly contemporary [[existentialism|existentialist thinkers]]. The term "Theatre of the Absurd" was coined by Martin Esslin in a book of the same name; Beckett and ''Godot'' were centerpieces of the book. Esslin argued these plays were the fulfilment of [[Albert Camus]]'s concept of "the absurd";&lt;ref&gt;Esslin (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; this is one reason Beckett is often falsely labeled as an existentialist (this is based on the assumption that Camus was an existentialist, though he in fact broke off from the existentialist movement and founded [[absurdism|his own philosophy]]). Though many of the themes are similar, Beckett had little affinity for existentialism as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerley and Gontarski (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, the plays deal with the subject of despair and the will to survive in spite of that despair, in the face of an uncomprehending and incomprehensible world. The words of Nell—one of the two characters in ''Endgame'' who are trapped in ashbins, from which they occasionally peek their heads to speak—can best summarize the themes of the plays of Beckett's middle period: "Nothing is funnier than unhappiness, I grant you that. ... Yes, yes, it's the most comical thing in the world. And we laugh, we laugh, with a will, in the beginning. But it's always the same thing. Yes, it's like the funny story we have heard too often, we still find it funny, but we don't laugh any more."&lt;ref&gt;''Endgame'', 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckett's outstanding achievements in prose during the period were the three novels [[Molloy (novel)|''Molloy'']] (1951), ''Malone meurt'' (1951; ''[[Malone Dies]]'') and ''L'innommable'' (1953: ''[[the Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]''). In these novels—sometimes referred to as a "trilogy", though this is against the author's own explicit wishes—the prose becomes increasingly bare and stripped down.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerley and Gontarski (2004)  p586&lt;/ref&gt; ''Molloy'', for instance, still retains many of the characteristics of a conventional novel (time, place, movement, and plot) and it makes use of the structure of a [[detective novel]]. In ''Malone Dies'', movement and plot are largely dispensed with, though there is still some indication of place and the passage of time; the "action" of the book takes the form of an [[Inner monologue|interior monologue]]. Finally, in ''The Unnamable'', almost all sense of place and time are abolished, and the essential theme seems to be the conflict between the voice's drive to continue speaking so as to continue existing, and its almost equally strong urge towards silence and oblivion. Despite the widely held view that Beckett's work, as exemplified by the novels of this period, is essentially pessimistic, the will to live seems to win out in the end; witness, for instance, the famous final phrase of ''The Unnamable'': 'I can't go on, I'll go on'.&lt;ref&gt;''Three Novels'', 414&lt;/ref&gt;

After these three novels, Beckett struggled for many years to produce a sustained work of prose, a struggle evidenced by the brief "stories" later collected as ''Texts for Nothing''. In the late 1950s, however, he created one of his most radical prose works, ''Comment c'est'' (1961; ''How It Is''. An early variant version of ''Comment c'est'', ''L'Image'', was published in the British arts review, [[X (magazine)|''X: A Quarterly Review'']] (1959), and is the first appearance of the novel in any form.&lt;ref&gt;"L’Image", X: A Quarterly Review, ed. [[David Wright (poet)|David Wright]] &amp; [[Patrick Swift]], Vol. I, No. 1, November 1959 [http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/web/beckett/career/howitis/publications.html Beckett Exhibition Harry Ransom Centre University of Texas at Austin]&lt;/ref&gt;). This work relates the adventures of an unnamed narrator crawling through the mud while dragging a sack of canned food. It was written as a sequence of unpunctuated paragraphs in a style approaching [[telegraphese]]: "You are there somewhere alive somewhere vast stretch of time then it's over you are there no more alive no more than again you are there again alive again it wasn't over an error you begin again all over more or less in the same place or in another as when another image above in the light you come to in hospital in the dark"&lt;ref&gt;''How It Is'', 22&lt;/ref&gt; Following this work, it was almost another decade before Beckett produced a work of non-dramatic prose. ''How It Is'' is generally considered to mark the end of his middle period as a writer.

Throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, Beckett's works exhibited an increasing tendency—already evident in much of his work of the 1950s—towards compactness. This has led to his work sometimes being described as [[minimalism|minimalist]]. The extreme example of this, among his dramatic works, is the 1969 piece ''[[Breath (play)|Breath]]'', which lasts for only 35 seconds and has no characters (though it was likely intended to offer ironic comment on ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]'', the theatrical [[revue]] for which it served as an introductory piece).&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson  (1997) p501&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samuel Beckett DCP 1341.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Portrait by [[Reginald Gray (artist)|Reginald Gray]]]]
In his theatre of the late period, Beckett's characters—already few in number in the earlier plays—are whittled down to essential elements. The ironically titled ''[[Play (play)|Play]]'' (1962), for instance, consists of three characters immersed up to their necks in large funeral urns. The television drama ''[[Eh Joe]]'' (1963), which was written for the actor [[Jack MacGowran]], is animated by a camera that steadily closes in to a tight focus upon the face of the title character. The play ''[[Not I]]'' (1972) consists almost solely of, in Beckett's words, "a moving mouth with the rest of the stage in darkness".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Knowlson  (1997) p522&lt;/ref&gt; Following from ''Krapp's Last Tape'', many of these later plays explore memory, often in the form of a forced recollection of haunting past events in a moment of stillness in the present. They also deal with the theme of the self confined and observed, with a voice that either comes from outside into the protagonist's head (as in ''Eh Joe'') or else another character comments on the protagonist silently, by means of gesture (as in ''Not I''). Beckett's most politically charged play, ''[[Catastrophe (play)|Catastrophe]]'' (1982), which was dedicated to [[Václav Havel]], deals relatively explicitly with the idea of [[dictatorship]]. After a long period of inactivity, Beckett's poetry experienced a revival during this period in the ultra-terse French poems of ''mirlitonnades'', with some as short as six words long. These defied Beckett's usual scrupulous concern to translate his work from its original into the other of his two languages; several writers, including [[Derek Mahon]], have attempted translations, but no complete version of the sequence has been published in English.

Beckett's prose pieces during the late period were not so prolific as his theatre, as suggested by the title of the 1976 collection of short prose texts ''Fizzles'' (which the American artist [[Jasper Johns]] illustrated). Beckett experienced something of a renaissance with the novella ''[[Company (short story)|Company]]'' (1980), which continued with ''[[Ill Seen Ill Said]]'' (1982) and ''[[Worstward Ho]]'' (1984), later collected in ''[[Nohow On]]''. In these three "'closed space' stories,"&lt;ref&gt;''Nohow On'', vii&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett continued his preoccupation with memory and its effect on the confined and observed self, as well as with the positioning of bodies in space, as the opening phrases of ''Company'' make clear: "A voice comes to one in the dark. Imagine." "To one on his back in the dark. This he can tell by the pressure on his hind parts and by how the dark changes when he shuts his eyes and again when he opens them again. Only a small part of what is said can be verified. As for example when he hears, You are on your back in the dark. Then he must acknowledge the truth of what is said."&lt;ref&gt;''Nohow On'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; Themes of aloneness and the doomed desire to successfully connect with other human beings are expressed in several late pieces, including ''[[Company (short story)|Company]]'' and ''[[Rockaby]]''.

In the hospital and nursing home where he spent his final days, Beckett wrote his last work, the 1988 poem "What is the Word" ("Comment dire"). The poem grapples with an inability to find words to express oneself, a theme echoing Beckett's earlier work, though possibly amplified by the sickness he experienced late in life.

==Collaborators==

===Jack MacGowran===
[[Jack MacGowran]] was the first actor to do a one-man show based on the works of Beckett. He debuted ''End of Day'' in Dublin in 1962, revising it as ''Beginning To End'' (1965). The show went through further revisions before Beckett directed it in Paris in 1970; MacGowran won the 1970–1971 Obie for Best Performance By an Actor when he performed the show off-Broadway as ''Jack MacGowran in the Works of Samuel Beckett.'' Beckett wrote the radio play ''[[Embers]]'' and the teleplay ''[[Eh Joe]]'' specifically for MacGowran. The actor also appeared in various productions of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' and ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]],'' and did several readings of Beckett's plays and poems on BBC Radio; he also recorded the LP, ''MacGowran Speaking Beckett'' for [[Claddagh Records]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://claddaghrecords.com/index.php/jack-macgowran-macgowran-speaking-beckett.html|title=Jack MacGowran - MacGowran Speaking Beckett|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigcitybooks.com/page6.htm|title=Big City Books - First Editions, Rare, Fanzines, Music Memorabilia - contact|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124010607/http://bigcitybooks.com/page6.htm|archivedate=24 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Billie Whitelaw===
[[Billie Whitelaw]] worked with Beckett for 25 years on such plays as ''[[Not I]]'', ''[[Eh Joe]]'', ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]'', and ''[[Footfalls]]'' and ''[[Rockaby]].'' She first met Beckett in 1963. In her autobiography ''Billie Whitelaw...: Who He?,'' she describes their first meeting in 1963 was "trust at first sight". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came to be regarded as his muse, the "supreme interpreter of his work", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in ''[[Not I]]''. She said of the play ''Rockaby'': "I put the tape in my head. And I sort of look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing ''Happy Days'' and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section. And I asked, and he thought for a bit and then said, 'Inward' ".&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5423443.ece ''The Times Literary Supplement'' 31 December 2008  ''Princes and players''.] Retrieved 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/webpages4/archives/whitelaw.html Whitelaw Biography – State University of New York.] Retrieved 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/feb/10/mondaymediasection.classics Guardian article ''Muse'' 10 February 2000.] Retrieved 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; She said of her role in ''Footfalls'': "I felt like a moving, musical [[Edvard Munch]] painting and, in fact, when Beckett was directing ''Footfalls'' he was not only using me to play the notes but I almost felt that he did have the paintbrush out and was painting."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/sep/01/artsfeatures2 Guardian article ''Plays for today'' 1 September 1999.] Retrieved 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; "Sam knew that I would turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted", she explained.

===Jocelyn Herbert===
The English stage designer [[Jocelyn Herbert]] was a close friend and influence on Beckett until his death. She worked with him on such plays as ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]'' (their third project) and ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre]]. Beckett said that Herbert became his closest friend in England: "She has a great feeling for the work and is very sensitive and doesn't want to bang the nail on the head. Generally speaking, there is a tendency on the part of designers to overstate, and this has never been the case with Jocelyn."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/may/08/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1 ''Guardian'' article ''Jocelyn Herbert''. 8 May 2003.] Retrieved 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walter Asmus===
The distinguished German director [[Walter D. Asmus]] began his working relationship with Beckett in the Schiller Theatre in Berlin in 1974 and continued until 1989, the year of the playwright's death.&lt;ref&gt;The Jocelyn Herbert Lecture 2015: Walter Asmus - The Art of Beckett&lt;/ref&gt; Asmus has directed all of Beckett's plays internationally.

Of all the English-language [[modernism|modernists]], Beckett's work represents the most sustained attack on the [[Realism (literature)|realist tradition]]. He opened up the possibility of theatre and fiction that dispense with conventional plot and the unities of time and place in order to focus on essential components of the human condition. [[Václav Havel]], [[John Banville]], [[Aidan Higgins]], [[Tom Stoppard]], [[Harold Pinter]] and [[Jon Fosse]] have publicly stated their indebtedness to Beckett's example. He has had a wider influence on [[experimental literature|experimental writing]] since the 1950s, from the [[Beat generation]] to the happenings of the 1960s and after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuttingball.com/endgame/essay.php |title="Beginning to End, Ending to Begin".

Many major 20th-century composers including [[Luciano Berio]], [[György Kurtág]], [[Morton Feldman]], [[Pascal Dusapin]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Roman Haubenstock-Ramati]] and [[Heinz Holliger]] have created musical works based on Beckett's texts. His work has also influenced numerous international writers, artists and filmmakers including [[Edward Albee]], [[Avigdor Arikha]], [[Paul Auster]], [[J. M. Coetzee]],&lt;ref&gt;These three writers and the artist Arikha cited in ''Beckett Remembering, Remembering Beckett'' (ed. James and Elizabeth Knowlson, New York: Arcade, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Kalich]], [[Douglas Gordon]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Anthony Minghella]],&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Knowlson (ed.), ''Beckett Remembering, Remembering Beckett'', 280&lt;/ref&gt; [[Damian Pettigrew]]&lt;ref&gt;Cited in ''No Author Better Served: The Correspondence of Samuel Beckett and Alan Schneider'' (ed.

Beckett is one of the most widely discussed and highly prized of 20th-century authors, inspiring a critical industry to rival that which has sprung up around James Joyce. He has divided critical opinion. Some early philosophical critics, such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]] and [[Theodor Adorno]], praised him, one for his revelation of absurdity, the other for his works' critical refusal of simplicities; others such as [[Georg Lukács]] condemned him for 'decadent' lack of [[Philosophical realism|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W. (1961) "Trying to Understand Endgame". ''[[New German Critique]]'', no. 26, (Spring-Summer 1982) p119–150. In ''The Adorno Reader'' ed. Brian O'Connor. [[Blackwell Publishers]]. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Beckett's death, all rights for performance of his plays are handled by the Beckett estate, currently managed by Edward Beckett (the author's nephew). The estate has a controversial reputation for maintaining firm control over how Beckett's plays are performed and does not grant licenses to productions that do not adhere to the writer's stage directions.

Historians interested in tracing Beckett's blood line were, in 2004, granted access to confirmed trace samples of his [[DNA]] to conduct molecular genealogical studies to facilitate precise lineage determination.

Some of the best-known pictures of Beckett were taken by photographer [[John Minihan (photographer)|John Minihan]], who photographed him between 1980 and 1985 and developed such a good relationship with the writer that he became, in effect, his official photographer. Some consider one of these to be among the top three photographs of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;1998  ''The Royal Academy'' Magazine, the "Image of the century"&lt;/ref&gt; It was the theater photographer John Haynes, however, who took possibly the most widely reproduced image of Beckett: it is used on the cover of the Knowlson biography, for instance. This portrait was taken during rehearsals of the San Quentin Drama Workshop at the Royal Court Theatre in London, where Haynes photographed many productions of Beckett's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnhaynesphotography.com/ |title=Photographer John Haynes's website |publisher=Johnhaynesphotography.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Central Bank of Ireland]] launched two Samuel Beckett Centenary [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Ireland)|commemorative coins]] on 26 April 2006: €10 Silver Coin and €20 Gold Coin.

On 10 December 2009, the new bridge across the [[River Liffey]] in Dublin was opened and named the [[Samuel Beckett Bridge]] in his honour. Reminiscent of a harp on its side, it was designed by the celebrated Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], who had also designed the [[James Joyce Bridge]] further upstream opened on [[Bloomsday]] (16 June) 2003. Attendees at the official opening ceremony included Beckett’s niece Caroline Murphy, his nephew Edward Beckett, poet [[Seamus Heaney]] and [[Barry McGovern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/1211/breaking4.htm|title=Samuel Beckett Bridge opens|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shooto''' is a [[combat sport]] and [[mixed martial arts]] organization that is governed by the ''Shooto Association'' and the ''International Shooto Commission''. Shooto was originally formed in 1985, as an organization and as a particular fighting system derived from [[shoot wrestling]]. Practitioners are referred to as '''shooters''', similarly to practitioners of shoot wrestling. Shooto rules have evolved such that their events are now true [[mixed martial arts]] competitions.

The word ''shooto'' is an English [[transliteration]] of 修斗 (pronounced ''shū-to''), an [[ateji]] derived from the English word "shoot".  The word 修斗 can be translated as "learn combat".
{{TOClimit|limit=3}}

==History==
Shooto was established as a "'''New Martial arts'''" ('''Shin-Kakutōgi''') in 1985 by [[Satoru Sayama]] (the original [[Tiger Mask (professional wrestling)|Tiger Mask]]), a Japanese [[professional wrestler]] trained in [[shoot wrestling]], who wished to create a sport that revolved around a realistic and effective fighting system.&lt;ref name=change/&gt;&lt;ref name=blood1/&gt; After its establishment New Martial arts was renamed "'''Shooting'''" which came from [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|Shoot]], a term of professional wrestling meaning "Serious match", but this changed to "Shooto" to avoid confusion with [[Shooting sports]]. Compared to the other professional wrestling organizations of the time, such as the [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] and the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Japan)]], Shooto was aimed at having no predetermined results. The first amateur event was held in 1986 and the first professional event in 1989.&lt;ref name=change/&gt;&lt;ref name="blood1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/1/a-blood-called-shooto-17377|title=A Blood Called Shooto|last=Breen|first=Jordan|date=2009-05-08|publisher=Sherdog.com|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shooto organization hosted the ''[[Vale Tudo Japan]]'' tournament in the summer of 1994. Previously to this tournament, Shooto did not feature [[punch (strike)|punches]] to the face in a [[ground fighting|ground position]], but after seeing effective usage of punching by foreign participants, Sayama decided to incorporate these striking techniques into shooto. In April 1996, ''World Shooto'', the ''Shooto Association'' and the ''International Shooto Commission'' were formed. This marked the end of Shooto as a single organization, and turned it into a [[combat sport]] with governing bodies. Since establishment of ISC, the champions of Shooto are called "World Champion". ''Vale Tudo Japan'' events were held annually from 1994 to 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/fightfinder/fightfinder.asp?Organization_ID%3D12 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 28, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312200216/http://www.sherdog.com/fightfinder/fightfinder.asp?Organization_ID=12 |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, it was announced that Vale Tudo Japan would return for the first time in ten years on October 30, 2009.

Shooto was brought to America in the late 1980s by top student of Satoru Sayama, [[Yorinaga Nakamura]]. He began teaching Shooto at the Inosanto Academy in 1991, and is the instructor of Erik Paulson, Ron Balicki, Dan Inosanto, Larry Hartsell, and many others.

Shooto South America, also known as ShootoBazil is managed by founder of [[Nova União (mixed martial arts)|Nova União mixed martial arts academy]],  [[André Pederneiras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jordy McElroy |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1892314-shooto-brazil-promoting-first-male-vs-female-fight-in-mma-history |title=Shooto Brazil Promoting 'First Male vs. Female Fight in MMA History' |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=2013-12-17 |accessdate=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first event was held in Rio de Janeiro in May 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Shooto-Americas-466 |title=Shooto Americas Fights, Fight Cards, Videos, Pictures, Events and more |website=Sherdog.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been an ongoing effort to bring Shooto competition to the United States and Canada that has been spearheaded by Rich Santoro.  He was officially named the Director of the International Shooto Commission - SHOOTO Americas division (the North American branch of the Shooto Association) in 2001.  He has worked with both U.S. event promoters and state officials to spread the Shooto brand of competition throughout North America.  As of 2006 Shooto has taken place in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee, Missouri, Nevada, Hawaii, and Vancouver, British Columbia.  Promoters of Shooto events in North America have been HOOKnSHOOT, The Ironheart Crown, Midwest Fighting, Tennessee Shooto, RSF Shooto Challenge, [[Tuff-N-Uff|TUFF-N-UFF]], World Freestyle Fighting, SHOOTO Hawaii and Mannidog Productions.

Previous to 2009, Shooto's rules included a knockdown rule giving knocked down fighters an eight-count to recover as well as allowing strikes to the back of the head. Shooto had argued that the potential for a knocked out (and thus unconscious) fighter to receive unnecessary damage while on the ground necessitated the rule, but with Shooto being one of the lone organizations still having the rule, consideration of the potential for injury allowing a knocked down fighter time to recover thus allowing additional blows, and with the original vision of Shooto's founder being a synthesis of striking, throwing and submitting - the rule change was instituted in mid-2008. The disallowment of strikes to the back of the head was done for similar medical reasons.&lt;ref name="change"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/changes-come-to-shooto-fighters-react-13082|title=Changes Come to Shooto, Fighters React|last=Breen|first=Jordan|publisher=Sherdog.com|accessdate=2009-05-13|date=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-running Japanese league Shooto and sister organization Vale Tudo Japan [[live-streamed]] its first shows on [[UFC Fight Pass]] in 2016.  Vale Tudo Japan bouts are contested in a cage instead of Shooto’s traditional ring,
Broadcast schedules for both promotions were announced April 20, 2016 during a press conference in Tokyo.
Shooto made its Fight Pass debut Saturday, April 23, with “Fight &amp; Mosh” live from Maihama Amphitheater in Urayasu, Japan. Two world titles were on the line, Masaaki Sugawara made his first defense of the 125-pound belt against Hiromasa Ogikubo, plus Koshi Matsumoto and Yuki Kawana vied for the vacant 155-pound mantle.
Shooto followed that up with events on July 17 and Nov. 12, both took place at Korakuen Hall in Tokyo as well as VTJ in Osaka” June 19 at Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium, and “VTJ 9th” on Sept. 19 which saw the organization return to its birthplace of Chiba prefecture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Techniques and strategies==
The aim in a shooto match is to defeat the opponent by a [[knockout]] or a [[submission (combat sport term)|submission]], but fights can also end in a referee stoppage or by a judge decision. Legal techniques include general [[grappling]], [[chokehold]]s, [[joint lock]]s, [[kick]]s, [[knee (strike)|knee strikes]], [[punch (strike)|punches]], [[takedown (grappling)|takedowns]] and [[throw (grappling)|throws]]. Illegal techniques include [[biting]], [[elbow (strike)|elbow strikes]], [[eye-gouging]], forearm strikes, hair pulling, [[headbutt]]ing, [[kick]]ing or [[knee (strike)|kneeing]] the head of a [[downed opponent]], [[small joint manipulation]], strikes to the [[groin]] or [[throat]] and since September 1, 2008, strikes to the back of the head.&lt;ref name=change/&gt;

==Fighter classes==
Shooto fighters are categorized into four Classes.
* Class-D : Amateur (2x2min, Headgear, Special point system)
* Class-C : Amateur (2x3min, Headgear, Special point system)
* Class-C+: Amateur (2x3min)
* Class-B : Pro     (2x5min)
* Class-A : Pro     (3x5min)

Fighters start out as Class-D or Class-C fighters and enter amateur competitions that Shooto hosts together with the help of local gyms all over Japan. Class-D Shooto does not allow knee strikes to the face or striking on the ground. Class-C Shooto does not allow striking on the ground, but knee strikes to the head are allowed. There are regional championship and once a year the All-Japan amateur championships. Then a fighter can get a Class-B pro license, these fights are 2x5 minute long and use the same rules as Class-A fights. Shooto holds yearly rookie tournaments in each weightclass.

When a fighter has gathered enough wins and experience in Class-B he will get awarded with a Class-A license, as a sign that he's part of the elite professional fighters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5498">In the [[entertainment industry]], a '''summer hit''' is a [[song]] that is released and peaks in its popularity during [[summer]].&lt;ref&gt;"Les tubes de l'été: chansons cultes, des sixties au années 2000", {{ISBN|9782290353554}}{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These songs rose in popularity during summer and thus classify as summer hits. In some years, a single [[Pop music|pop]] song will gain widespread international popularity during the summer holiday season, becoming that summer's definitive summer hit in many countries. Many of the best-known summer hits emerge from outside the British and American pop music industries.

Songs that are marketed to be summer hits are very common, and often feature an [[upbeat]] [[tempo]] and descriptions of things such as relaxation outdoors and beach parties. These are songs considered ideal listening during summer activities. These intentional summer hits are most common in [[Country music|country]] (particularly [[country pop]]) and mainstream popular music but are much less common in [[Rock music|rock]].

The opposite of a summer hit in the music industries of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] in the [[Western world|West]] would be a [[Christmas music|Christmas song]], a category that usually incorporates general winter songs as well.

'''Temple Bar''' ({{lang-ga|Barra an Teampaill}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.logainm.ie/1380149.aspx| publisher = Irish Placenames Commission | website = logainm.ie | title = Barra an Teampaill / Temple Bar | accessdate = 1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an area on the south bank of the [[River Liffey]] in central [[Dublin]], Ireland. The area is bounded by the Liffey to the north, Dame Street to the south, [[Westmoreland Street]] to the east and [[Fishamble Street]] to the west. It is promoted as Dublin's 'cultural quarter' and, as a centre of Dublin's city centre's [[nightlife]], is a [[tourist destination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.visitdublin.com/dublin-vibrant-city-quarters | publisher = National Tourism Development Authority (Fáilte Ireland) | website = visitdublin.com | title = Dublin Quarters - Visit Dublin | accessdate = 1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple Bar is in the [[Dublin postal districts|postcode]] Dublin 2 (D2).

==History==
In medieval (Anglo-Norman) times, the name of the district was St. Andrews Parish.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite web|author = Sean Murphy | title = A Short History of Dublin's Temple Bar | publisher = Centre for Irish Genealogical and Historical Studies | place = Bray, County Wicklow | url = http://homepage.eircom.net/~seanjmurphy/dublin/templebar.htm | date = | accessdate = 1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a suburb, located outside the city walls. But the area fell into disuse beginning in the 14th century because it was exposed to attacks by the native Irish.&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt;

The land was redeveloped again in the 17th century, to create gardens for the houses of wealthy English families. At that time the shoreline of the [[River Liffey]] ran further inland of where it lies today, along the line formed by Essex Street, Temple Bar and Fleet Street. Marshy land to the river side of this line was progressively walled in and reclaimed, allowing houses to be built upon what had been the shoreline; but unusually, the reclaimed land was not quayed, so that the back yards of the houses ran down to the water's edge. (Not until 1812 were these back yards replaced by Wellington Quay.) The fronts of the houses then constituted a new street. The first mention of Temple Bar as the name of this street is in [[Bernard de Gomme]]'s Map of Dublin from 1673, which shows the reclaimed land and new buildings. Other street names given nearby are Dammas Street (now Dame Street) and Dirty Lane (now Temple Lane South).&lt;ref name = "Murphy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dirty Lane was originally called "Hoggen Lane" (i.e. hogs' lane); in the late 1680s it acquired the name "Dirty Lane", and this was then changed to "Temple Lane" in the early 1700s. At that time it was mostly occupied by warehouses and stables, along with the Shakespeare Tavern, "a much frequented establishment". (John T. Gilbert, ''A History of the City of Dublin'', 1859, vol. 2, p. 316.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Merchants Arch Temple Bar.jpg|thumb|upright|Entrance from Merchant's Arch]]
It is generally thought that the street known as Temple Bar got its name from the Temple family, whose progenitor [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|Sir William Temple]] built a house and gardens there in the early 1600s.&lt;ref name="curtis"&gt;{{cite book | title = Temple Bar: A History | author = Maurice Curtis | publisher = History Press Ireland | date = 2016 | isbn = 9781845888961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temple had moved to Ireland in 1599 with the [[Essex in Ireland|expeditionary force of the Earl of Essex]], for whom he served as secretary. (He had previously been secretary of [[Sir Philip Sydney]] until the latter was killed in battle.) After Essex was beheaded for treason in 1601, Temple "retired into private life", but he was then solicited to become provost of [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]], serving from 1609 until his death in 1627 at age 72. William Temple's son [[John Temple (judge)|John]] became the "Master of the Rolls in Ireland" and was the author of a famous pamphlet excoriating the native Irish population for an uprising in 1641.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.dublininquirer.com/2016/08/10/for-one-local-historian-a-rediscovery-of-temple-bar | publisher = Dublin Inquirer | website = dublininquirer.com | title = For One Local Historian, a Rediscovery of Temple Bar | date = 10 August 2016 | accessdate = 1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; John's son [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]] became a famous English statesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = John T. Gilbert | title = A History of the City of Dublin | year = 1859 | volume = 2| pages = 315-316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this grand lineage, however, the name of Temple Bar street seems to have been more directly borrowed from the storied [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar district in London]], where the main toll-gate into London was located dating back to medieval times. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;London's Temple Bar is adjoined by Essex Street to the west and Fleet Street to the east, and streets of the same names occupy similar positions in relation to Dublin's Temple Bar. It seems almost certain therefore that Dublin's Temple Bar was named firstly in imitation of the historic Temple precinct in London. However, a secondary and equally plausible reason for using the name Temple Bar in Dublin would be a reference to one of the area's most prominent families, in a sort of pun or play on words. Or as it has been put more succinctly, Temple Bar 'does honour to London and the landlord in nicely-gauged proportions'.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, op. cit., quoting National Library of Ireland, '’Historic Dublin Maps'’, Dublin 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fishamble Street near Temple Bar was the location of the first performance of [[Georg Friedrich Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' on 13 April 1742. An annual performance of the ''Messiah'' is held on the same date at the same location. A republican revolutionary group, the [[Society of the United Irishmen]], was formed at a meeting in a tavern in Eustace Street in 1791.

In the 18th century Temple Bar was the centre of prostitution in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.estudiosirlandeses.org/reviews/striapacha-tri-chead-bliain-duailcis-prostitutes-three-hundred-years-of-vice/ | title = Striapacha Tri Chead Bliain Duailcis (Prostitutes: Three Hundred Years of Vice) | author = Niamh O’Reilly | work = J Irish Studies| publisher = Estudios Irlandeses }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, the area slowly declined in popularity, and in the 20th century, it suffered from [[urban decay]], with many derelict buildings.

In the 1980s, the state-owned transport company [[Córas Iompair Éireann]] (C.I.É.) proposed to buy up and demolish property in the area and build a bus terminus in its place. While that was in the planning stages, the purchased buildings were let out at low rents, which attracted small shops, artists and galleries to the area. Protests by [[An Taisce]], residents and traders led to the cancellation of the bus station project, and then [[Taoiseach]] [[Charles Haughey]] was responsible for securing funding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/charles-haughey-482309.html | title = Obituary - Charles Haughey | publisher = The Independent | website = independent.co.uk | date = 14 June 2006 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100401045204/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/charles-haughey-482309.html | archivedate = 1 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1991, the [[Government of Ireland|government]] set up a not-for-profit company called ''Temple Bar Properties'' to oversee the regeneration of the area as Dublin's cultural quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title = Temple Bar Framework Plan | publisher = Dublin Corporation | year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.templebar.ie | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031204122614/http://www.templebar.ie/index.asp | archivedate = 4 December 2003 | title = Temple Bar - Home Page | publisher = TempleBar.ie | quote = ''Temple Bar Properties is the company established in 1991 to revitalise the area as a Cultural Quarter'' | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, "stag parties" and "hen nights" were supposedly banned (or discouraged) from Temple Bar, mainly due to drunken loutish behaviour, although this seems to have lapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19990103/ai_n9704845 | title = Bar Stag Ban Sends Revellers To London| publisher = Sunday Mirror | date = 4 January 1999 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20081014030037/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19990103/ai_n9704845 | archivedate = 14 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, noise and anti-social behaviour remain a problem at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2008/0910/1220919675018.html | title = Nightmare in a city that never sleeps | publisher = Irish Times | website = irishtimes.com | date = 9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==
[[File:20130807 dublin157.JPG|thumb|The Temple Bar Pub on Temple Lane]]
[[Image:Gogarty.JPG|thumb|The Oliver St John Gogarty Pub in Temple Bar]]
The area is the location of a number of cultural institutions, including the Irish Photography Centre (incorporating the Dublin Institute of Photography, the [[National Photographic Archive]] and the Gallery of Photography), the Ark Children's Cultural Centre, the [[Irish Film Institute]], incorporating the [[Irish Film Archive]], the Button Factory, the Arthouse Multimedia Centre, [[Temple Bar Gallery and Studio]]s, the [[Project Arts Centre]], the [[Gaiety School of Acting]], [[IBAT College Dublin]], the [[New Theatre, Dublin|New Theatre]], as well as the [[Irish Stock Exchange]].

After dark, the area is a centre for nightlife, with various tourist-focused nightclubs, restaurants and bars. Pubs in the area include The Temple Bar Pub, [[Porterhouse Brewery|The Porterhouse]], the Oliver St. John Gogarty, the Turk's Head, Czech Inn, the Quays Bar, the Foggy Dew, The Auld Dubliner and Bad Bobs.

The area has two renovated squares&amp;nbsp;– ''Meetinghouse Square'' and the central ''Temple Bar Square''. The Temple Bar Book Market is held on Saturdays and Sundays in Temple Bar Square. Meetinghouse Square, which takes its name from the nearby [[Quaker]] Meeting House, is used for outdoor film-screenings in the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.meetinghousesquare.ie/about/the_story/index.html | publisher = Temple Bar Cultural Trust | website = meetinghousesquare.ie | title = The Story of Meeting House Square | accessdate = 1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since summer 2004, Meetinghouse Square is also home to the 'Speaker's Square' project (an area of [[public speaking]]) and to the 'Temple Bar Food Market' on Saturdays.

The 'Cow's Lane Market' is a fashion and design market which takes place on Cow's Lane on Saturdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/homes-and-property/to-market-to-market-1.391808 | publisher = Irish Times | website = irishtimes.com | title = To market, to market ... | date = 13 November 2003 | accessdate = 1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the 13th century [[Holy Trinity, Dublin: Augustinian Friars|Augustinian Friary of the Holy Trinity]] is visible within an apartment/restaurant complex called 'The Friary'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Casey |first=Christine  |year=2005 |title=Dublin: The City Within the Grand and Royal Canals and the Circular Road with the Phoenix Park |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQzYxvX_U8MC&amp;pg=PA440 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=440 |isbn=0300109237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
A dance sequence from [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Ek Tha Tiger]]'' was filmed in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://filmireland.net/2011/09/29/bollywood-film-%e2%80%98ek-tha-tiger%e2%80%99-i-am-tiger-shoots-in-temple-bar-dublin-in-october/ |

'''''The American Girls Premiere''''' is an educational computer game developed and published by [[The Learning Company]] for [[American Girl]]. The game allows players to create theatrical productions featuring characters from American Girl's Historical collection, along with scenes and other elements unique to each of the girls' respective time periods.

It is the first installment of the [[American Girl (video game series)|''American Girl'' series]], and so far the only one to date to be released on [[Mac OS]]; subsequent personal computer titles in the series were released for Windows. ''The American Girls Premiere'' was later followed by ''[[The American Girls: Dress Designer]]'', a [[paper doll]]-based [[software toy]] released by [[Mattel Interactive]] in 1999.

==Gameplay==

Built upon the earlier [[MECC]] game ''[[Opening Night (video game)|Opening Night]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Alexander | first = Steve | title = CD-ROM lets girls create historical stage plays; Software industry is remiss no longer. | work = [[Star Tribune]] | date = July 16, 2003 | accessdate = September 20, 2016 | url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62616611.html | publisher = via HighBeam {{Subscription required}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The American Girls Premiere'' allows the creation and direction of unique stage plays starring the [[List of American Girl characters#BeForever|Historical Characters]], from [[Felicity Merriman]], representing the [[American Revolution]], to [[Molly McIntire]], daughter of an army doctor during [[World War II]], alongside supporting characters from each of the girls' story arcs.&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-12-18/features/9712180324_1_madeline-european-adventures-auntie-mame-game-developers|title=Non-violent Games Show Girls Just Want To Have Fun|last=Olson|first=Karen Torme|date=December 18, 1997|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SKPremiere"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superkids.com/aweb/pages/reviews/girls/2/agirlpre/merge.shtml|title=SuperKids Software Review of American Girls Premiere.|work=SuperKids|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After selecting a character, players are presented with a stage to which plays are created or presented, utilizing a drag-and-drop interface to add actors, props, lighting and other elements to the scene.&lt;ref name="Lotiempo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt; Digitized sprites taken from live actors and props from American Girl's historical collection are used throughout the game, ''à la''-''[[Mortal Kombat#Graphics|Mortal Kombat]]''. Each of the characters have their own set of outfits based on the historical era their stories take place in, e.g. long gowns and petticoats for Felicity or [[argyle (pattern)|argyle]] sweaters and blouses for Molly, along with scenarios from their respective time period. Players can also add dialogue in their productions, either through a voice recording, or using the built-in [[text-to-speech]] feature. The game develops skills in storytelling and writing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20048723.html|title=The Fun-Damentals of Learning: This Holiday Season, Leave the Video Games in the Store and Give the Gift of Knowledge Instead|last=Clarke|first=Robyn|date=December 1, 1997|work=Black Enterprise|access-date=|via=Highbeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is [[Glossary of video game terms#Sandbox game|open-ended]] in nature, allowing the player to create theatrical productions at his or her own leisure, though the limited selection of characters, props and settings may present creative constraints to some players.&lt;ref name="Savignano" /&gt;

In addition to the main game, bonus content such as a tutorial application and a sampler called the ''Director's Guide'' is included for players to get acquainted with the game's mechanics and user interface, along with a behind-the-scenes look on production as well as historical facts and commentary on American history and culture, and backstories for each of the characters.&lt;ref name="CDA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdaccess.com/html/shared/amerg2nd.htm|title=The American Girls Premiere 2nd Edition on CD-ROM from CDAccess.com|work=CDAccess|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haggerty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcnj.edu/~technj/win98/premiere.html|title=TECH-NJ: Winter 1998: THE AMERICAN GIRLS PREMIERE|last=Haggerty|first=Pamela|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The game marked the debut of [[Pleasant Company]] – the creator of the ''American Girl'' franchise – into the digital software space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56416072.html|title=All dolled up but nowhere to go|last=Ray|first=Robin|date=October 26, 1997|work=The Boston Herald|access-date=|via=Highbeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Ehrmann, vice president of Internet business strategy consulting firm Grey Interactive, said that the video game had a due potential as it was entering a relatively untapped market, commenting that in the interactive media space, "girls are for the most part totally ignored."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-22965166.html|title=SOFTWARE DESIGNERS GET WITH THE PROGRAM – AT LAST, THEY'RE DISCOVERING GIRLS|last=|first=|date=November 9, 1997|work=The Buffalo News|access-date=|via=Highbeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game could be bought from major software retailers or ordered directly from The Learning Company or American Girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-69508476.html|title=AMERICAN GIRLS CD-ROM HELPS CHILDREN CREATE STORIES|last=|first=|date=September 18, 1997|work=The Wisconsin State Journal|access-date=|via=Highbeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
A "Special Edition Collector's Set" of the title was double the price, and in addition to the CD-ROM, it came with: "a keepsake tin, a one-year club membership, a club handbook, a membership card, a baseball cap and six bi-monthly issues of the club newspaper".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=September 25, 1997|title=CD-ROM lets girls create historical stage plays; Software industry is remiss no longer.(VARIETY)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62616611.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An update to the game subtitled '''''2nd Edition''''' was released in 1998, adding Josefina Montoya to the roster in line with the aforementioned doll's debut.&lt;ref name="2ndedition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-learning-company-inc-and-pleasant-company-proudly-present-the-american-girls-premiere-2nd-edition-76498332.html|title=The Learning Company, Inc. and Pleasant Company Proudly Present The American Girls Premiere 2nd Edition|work=PRNewswire|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''2nd Edition'' release is a standalone [[expansion pack]] containing characters and scenes from the first release, and does not require a copy of the original game to play. The aforementioned ''Collector's Set'' was later updated to include the Josefina-specific content from the 2nd Edition, though it is missing the American Girls Club membership kit.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
''The American Girls Premiere'' was released to mostly positive reception, with praise being given for providing children a "creative outlet"; a number of reviewers however criticized the user interface to be intimidating and complicated.&lt;ref name="Barnabel"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/03/education/software-toonsville-tutors.html|title=Software; Toonsville Tutors|last=Barnabel|first=Josh|date=January 3, 1999|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite news | last = Rosenberg | first = Ronald | title = Edutainment software abounds; quality varies | work = [[The Boston Globe]] | date = December 14, 1997 | accessdate = September 20, 2016 | url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8447169.html | publisher = via HighBeam {{Subscription required}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's software review site SuperKids noted that "Those who chose to spend time with the program were delighted with their creations,"&lt;ref name="SKPremiere" /&gt; Lisa Karen Savignano of [[AllGame]] also noted the game's steep learning curve and limited selection of scenarios and props for authoring stage productions, but gave ''American Girls Premiere'' a largely positive review, stating "I think any girl would be entertained by this and it may start them on the road to creating not just plays, but stories and art of their own,"&lt;ref name="Savignano"/&gt; Kevin Mukhar of [[Computer Shopper (US magazine)|Computer Shopper]] thought the game would provide hours of open-ended play to young girls ages 7–12 who liked the ''American Girl'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19994381.html|title=The American Girls Premiere|last=Mukhar|first=Kevin|date=December 1, 1997|work=Computer Shopper|access-date=|via=Highbeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer from The Wisconsin State Journal praised the game for being "historically accurate", easy to use, and providing players with "limitless creativity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-69505194.html|title=DOLLED-UP CD A HIT|last=|first=|date=November 7, 1997|work=The Wisconsin State Journal|access-date=|via=Highbeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buffalo News commented that the title wouldn't appeal to the "easily bored" or "readily frustrated", but that it would thrill players who were willing to invest both the time and energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-22960656.html|title=KNOW THE FACTS, THEN GO FOR THE PROGRAMMERS' BEST|last=GALARNEAU|first=ANDREW Z.|date=November 27, 1997|work=The Buffalo News|access-date=|via=Highbeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Capital Times praised the artwork as "rich and detailed", and noted that the interface was user-friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=September 26, 1997|title=AMERICAN GIRLS GET VIRTUAL DOLL HOUSE.(Today's Business)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-69509305.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playthings deemed it a "winner".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=January 1, 2000|title=Atlanta.(Brief Article)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-59426855.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clint Basinger of ''Lazy Game Reviews'' also criticized ''Premiere'''s similarity to ''Opening Night'' and what he saw as limited educational value, but praised its appeal to fans of the American Girl franchise, calling it a "neat little program" and a "fascinating industry case study" on [[Women and video games|video games aimed at girls]] and [[White-label product|repackaging]] an existing product to drive sales through the use of a licensed property.&lt;ref name="Basinger"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqGwUffHyCo|title=American Girls Premiere: Text-To-Speech Mayhem|last=Basinger|first=Clint|date=21 April 2017|work=Lazy Game Reviews|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many reviewers noted that ''The American Girls Premiere'' was a prime example of video games targeted at the female demographic. Deborah Porterfield of the [[Chicago Sun-Times]] described the title as "for girls" and "girl-oriented".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4405381.html|title=Guide to some new girl-oriented computer games|last=Porterfield|first=Deborah|date=September 23, 1997|work=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=|via=Highbeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buffallo News suggested that the game was "at the top of many girls' Christmas wish lists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=COMPUTER GAME BRINGS AMERICAN GIRLS TO LIFE|last=LoTempio|first=Elizabeth|date=November 11, 1997|work=The Buffalo News|access-date=|via=Highbeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing this title as an example, The Boston Globe reviewer Joann Muller suggested that while the video game industry had begun to make commercially successful titles that appealed to the female demographic, the rushed targeting of games directly to girls could "perpetuate gender stereotypes" and "[not] teach girls anything of value about computers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8458666.html|title=A GAME OF THEIR OWN NEW COMPUTER SOFTWARE AIMS TO ENTERTAIN AND EDUCATE PRE-TEENAGE GIRLS|last=Muller|first=Joann|date=March 30, 1998|work=The Boston Globe|access-date=|via=Highbeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buffalo News thought this game was the first "girl-targeted software" from The Learning Company, a company that had built its catalogue from "gender-neutral educational software".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rocky Mountain News reported that Children's Software Revue gave the title a "tentative endorsement" due to offering a "female spin" to traditional video game genres such as adventure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=November 24, 1997|title=SOFTWARE BYTES.(Business)(SoftWARE page)(Review)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67745146.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sales===
In December 1997, the game "achieved the highest monthly dollar and unit sales of any single product" in the history of The Learning Company up to that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com.dbgw.lis.curtin.edu.au/docview/450040829?rfr_id=info%3Axri%2Fsid%3Aprimo|title=The American Girls Premiere Top Ranked Educational Title in December For Third Consecutive Month|last=|first=|date=January 23, 1998|work=PR Newswire|access-date=|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1998, The Boston Globe said the girls' category of the video game market was "exploding" with titles such as ''[[Barbie Fashion Designer]]'' (by [[Mattel]]), ''The American Girls Premiere, [[Let's Talk About Me]],'' (by [[Simon &amp; Schuster|Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive]]) and ''[[Rockett's New School]]'' (by [[Purple Moon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8460578.html|title=VIRTUAL EQUALITY?

==Legacy==
In a similar vein to ''[[Moonbase Alpha (video game)|Moonbase Alpha]]'', ''The American Girls Premiere'' has gained a [[cult video game|cult following]] due to its use of a [[text-to-speech]] system by [[Lernout &amp; Hauspie]], which most players find to be ironically appealing. Adding to the unintentional humor is the lack of collision detection and other quirks within the game engine allowing characters to perform unusual movements, which led to a number of parody [[machinima]] clips on [[YouTube]] and other video sharing platforms.&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/the-american-girls-pc-games-text-to-speech-feature-was-great-for-dick-jokes|title=The 'American Girls' PC Game's Text-To-Speech Feature Was Great for Dick Jokes - Motherboard|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Weiß Schwarz'''''|ヴァイスシュヴァルツ|Vaisu Shuvarutsu}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[collectible card game]] created by [[Bushiroad]]. The game is separated into Weiß-side and Schwarz-side. "Weiß" and "Schwarz" are [[German language]] for [[white]] and [[black]], respectively. 

== Gameplay ==

The game focuses on 2 main aspects, character battle and clock/level which regulate what cards can be played as well as acting as a player's life point.

== Victory conditions ==
* The player that forces his or her opponent to Level 4 wins the game immediately.
* Opposing player has no cards left in Library and Waiting Room.

== Playing Areas ==

===Deck Area === 

The player's deck is placed face down in this area and consists of 50 cards. Unlike other trading card games when the deck runs out of cards the player reconstructs a deck out of the cards in their waiting room.&lt;ref name=QGuide&gt;{{cite web|title=Trial Deck Quick Guide|url=http://ws-tcg.com/en/images/WSEN_MM_W17_BP_RULES.pdf|website=Weiβ Schwarz Official Website|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Level Area === 

Cards placed in this area represent the player's level. Upon reaching level 4, the player loses.&lt;ref name=QGuide&gt;{{cite web|title=Trial Deck Quick Guide|url=http://ws-tcg.com/en/images/WSEN_MM_W17_BP_RULES.pdf|website=Weiβ Schwarz Official Website|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clock Area === 

When a player takes damage, the amount is then added in cards to this area. This zone can hold up to six cards at time. However, when a seventh card is added the player is forced to level up.&lt;ref name=QGuide&gt;{{cite web|title=Trial Deck Quick Guide|url=http://ws-tcg.com/en/images/WSEN_MM_W17_BP_RULES.pdf|website=Weiβ Schwarz Official Website|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stock Area === 

Cards representing "Stock" are placed in this area. Cards in this area are placed faced down after trigger check and cannot be revised or rearranged.&lt;ref name=QGuide&gt;{{cite web|title=Trial Deck Quick Guide|url=http://ws-tcg.com/en/images/WSEN_MM_W17_BP_RULES.pdf|website=Weiβ Schwarz Official Website|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climax Area === 

A maximum of one face-up Climax card is allowed in this zone.

=== Stage Area === 

Consists of five stage positions. Character cards are placed face-up in these areas. There are two types of Stage Areas:

* '' Center Stage ''
The three foremost positions make up the Center Stage. Character cards placed in this area can battle with opponent's Character cards directly in front of them.&lt;ref name=QGuide&gt;{{cite web|title=Trial Deck Quick Guide|url=http://ws-tcg.com/en/images/WSEN_MM_W17_BP_RULES.pdf|website=Weiβ Schwarz Official Website|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'' Back Stage '' 
The two rear positions make up the Back stage. Character cards placed in this area cannot battle with opponent's Character cards. However, cards in this usually possess support abilities.&lt;ref name=QGuide&gt;{{cite web|title=Trial Deck Quick Guide|url=http://ws-tcg.com/en/images/WSEN_MM_W17_BP_RULES.pdf|website=Weiβ Schwarz Official Website|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Waiting Room === 

Cards that have been retired/used are placed in this area. Example: Character cards defeated in battle.&lt;ref name=QGuide&gt;{{cite web|title=Trial Deck Quick Guide|url=http://ws-tcg.com/en/images/WSEN_MM_W17_BP_RULES.pdf|website=Weiβ Schwarz Official Website|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory Area === 

The cards that are removed from the game are placed in this area.&lt;ref name=QGuide&gt;{{cite web|title=Trial Deck Quick Guide|url=http://ws-tcg.com/en/images/WSEN_MM_W17_BP_RULES.pdf|website=Weiβ Schwarz Official Website|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clock phase ===

Climax cards are played during this phase.

=== Battle phase ===

The player declares an attack of choice with his/her characters one at a time to damage the opponent's life points (called "Clock" in Weiß Schwarz) and also their characters (if present) at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;
During the first turn of the game, the player who goes first may only declare an attack with one character.&lt;br /&gt;
Only Characters that are in [Stand] Position and in the Center Stage can declare attacks.&lt;br /&gt;
Characters declaring attack will be put to [Rest] position from [Stand] position.&lt;br /&gt;
The 3 different types of Attack:
* ''Direct Attack''
This attack is the default attack when a character is attacking an empty slot.&lt;br /&gt;
The attacking character will gain an additional Soul Damage to the Soul Damage total.
* ''Front Attack''
The player may choose this attack when a character is attacking and there is a character opposing it. Battle between the characters will occur and the character with the lower Power will be put to [Reverse]. Characters that are put to [Reverse] will be sent to the Waiting Room during the Encore Phase unless otherwise stated.
* ''Side Attack''
The player may choose this attack when a character is attacking and there is a character opposing it. Battle between the characters will NOT occur. The attacking character will suffer a Soul Damage penalty that is equivalent to the Level of the opposing character.

=== Trigger phase ===

Upon declaring an attack from front attack, side attack, or direct attack, a card is flipped over from your deck as trigger to check for trigger (effect varies upon trigger) and the card goes into stock.

=== Counter phase ===

If you declared a front attack, your opponent may play a character/event counter card, if they have one.

=== Damage phase ===

Your opponent takes damage equivalent to your soul output + soul trigger upon trigger step (if any) onto their clock. 7 cards on the clock raises your level by 1, and any additional damage are retained onto your next level. However, should you flip over a climax card, all the damage sustained for that damage step is canceled, and they are moved into the waiting room (discard pile) instead.

=== Character battling phase ===

This Phase occurs only when a Front Attack is declared.&lt;br /&gt;
A Power comparison between the characters is done and the character with the lower Power is put to [Reverse].&lt;br /&gt;
If the power of both battling characters are the same, both of them are put to [Reverse].

=== Encore phase ===

This Phase occurs when the Main Player has decided to stop attacking.&lt;br /&gt;
All Characters that are in the [Reverse] state are sent to the Waiting Room.&lt;br /&gt;
Both Players are allowed to "Revive" their characters by paying the characters' respective Encore cost.&lt;br /&gt;
Even when not stated, all character cards comes with a built-in ability [Auto] Encore (3), which means that a player may pay 3 cost from his/her stock to "Revive" a character which has been put to [Reverse].&lt;br /&gt;
The Encored characters will be put back from the Waiting Room in [Rest] position to their original position on the Center Stage.

=== End phase ===

You pass on your turn to the opponent.

== Card type ==

There are 3 main type of cards in Weiß Schwarz, namely character cards, event cards and climax cards. They are further broken down into colors and level subcategory. A deck can contain any four copies of cards with the same name, and no more than 8 climax cards per deck. The number of cards in a deck build is exactly 50.

=== Character cards ===

Character cards form the base of the gameplay, serving as your means of damaging the opponent and subsequently defeating them. Character cards have several features which include the level and cost on the top left, soul trigger on the top right, effects, color, power, soul output and traits on the bottom of the card. To play a character, you have to meet the color requirement (applies only to card level 1 and above), the cost requirement and the level requirement.

=== Event cards ===

Event cards act as an instant play card during your main phase which may give functions like retrievals or healing effects. Event cards have to meet color and level requirements to be played.

=== Climax cards ===

Climax cards act as a means to boost your soul and power damage output during your climax phase upon play, as means to increase soul output or resources advantage upon triggering on trigger phase and also serves as damage canceler during damage phase. Because of the usefulness of climax cards, a deck is capped at 8 climaxes. Climax card have to meet the color requirement to be played during climax phase.

The '''Z Channel''' was one of the first [[pay television]] stations in the [[United States]]. Launched in 1974 from [[Los Angeles, California]], this station was known for its devotion to the art of cinema due to the eclectic choice of films&lt;ref name="la001"&gt;"Film-News and Notes." ''[[Daily News of Los Angeles]]'' October 3, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  by the programming chief, [[Jerry Harvey (screenwriter)|Jerry Harvey]]. It also popularized the use of [[letterbox]]ing on television, as well as showing '[[director's cut]]' versions of films (which is a term popularized after Z Channel's showing of ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]''). Z Channel's devotion to cinema and choice of rare and important films had an important influence on such directors as [[Robert Altman]], [[Quentin Tarantino]], and [[Jim Jarmusch]].

==History==
Z Channel was launched in 1974 by Theta Cable (a division of [[TelePrompTer Corporation]] and [[Hughes Aircraft Co.]]) which was acquired by [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] (Westinghouse) in 1981. Operations were located in Santa Monica, California. [[Jerry Harvey (screenwriter)|Jerry Harvey]] was hired as program director in 1980. As program director, Harvey was given permission to program the network the way he saw fit. As such, the network featured a wide variety of films not typically shown on other pay television services at the time. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Magazine-Entertainment-Subscribers-Channel-Television/dp/B019HK475M/ref=sr_1_10?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534108883&amp;sr=1-10&amp;refinements=p_27%3AHal+Kaufman Z Magazine: The Entertainment Guide for Subscribers to the Z Channel and Theta Cable Television - Feb/Mar/Apr, 1979 - Vol. 5, No. 9 - High Anxiety on cover-Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Magazine-Entertainment-Subscribers-Television-MacArthur/dp/B019HJBA0I/ref=sr_1_14?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534109115&amp;sr=1-14&amp;refinements=p_27%3AHal+Kaufman]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Magazine-Entertainment-Subscribers-Channel-Television/dp/B019HJQFLW/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534108781&amp;sr=1-8&amp;refinements=p_27%3AHal+Kaufman Z Magazine: The Entertainment Guide for Subscribers to the Z Channel and Theta Cable Television - Aug/Sept, 1979 - Vol. 6, No. 4 - Jaws on cover-Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Magazine-Entertainment-Subscribers-Channel-Television/dp/B019HJ4YL0/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534204835&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=z+channel+god]&lt;/ref&gt;

These included many [[B movies]], silent films, foreign films, and original unedited versions of films. 
On Christmas Eve 1982, Harvey made the decision to show the original (previously unreleased in two years) version of ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', a movie that had been considered a disaster by all accounts. His decision was a success and the movie became the most watched feature ever shown on Z Channel. Other networks soon followed and aired ''Heaven's Gate.''

By the mid-1980s, Z Channel had 90,000 subscribers. In 1987, Group W sold Z Channel to Seattle-based Rock Associates for $5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-22/business/fi-336_1_los-angeles|title=Rainbow to Add Hockey Games : Z Channel Sold to Sports, News Programming Firm|website=latimes|accessdate=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both increased competition and lack of interest by Group W leading up to the sale led to a decrease in subscribers. In January 1988, Rock Associates merged with [[Comcast Spectacor|American Spectacor]].

In April 1988, there were two major (though unrelated) changes; the departure of Jerry Harvey due to his suicide and the addition of sports to the network. Deals were made to bring games from the [[Los Angeles Angels|Angels]], [[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers]] and [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] to the network.&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAEnT6Z-xcw|title=Z Channel 1987|website=YouTube|accessdate=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increased the numbers of subscribers to 110,000. The sports deals were funded by selling advertising during the games. However, a lawsuit ensued with a court ruling that contracts with the movie studios stipulated that the service be commercial-free.

Out of options, the channel was sold to [[Cablevision]] and [[NBC]] on March 16, 1989, who were partners in the joint-venture [[SportsChannel]]. On June 29, 1989 Z Channel faded to black&lt;ref name="hr001"&gt;"Z Channel Fading To Black Amid Film Industry Tributes." ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' April 27, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by [[SportsChannel Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="la002"&gt;"Hollywood Freeway." ''[[Daily News of Los Angeles]]'' June 26, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The last film shown on Z Channel was the John Ford film ''[[My Darling Clementine]].''&lt;ref name="latimes2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-25/entertainment/ca-6488_1_z-channel-jerry-harvey-theta-cableable|title=The Death of Z Channel--What Now? : The History : Beset by troubles, quirky station will switch to all-sports|website=latimes|accessdate=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The channel was the subject of the 2004 documentary ''[[Z Channel: A Magnificent Obsession]]'', which was directed by [[Alexandra Cassavetes]], daughter of [[John Cassavetes]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/01/11/z-channel-a-magnificent-obsession Z Channel: A Magnificent Obsession-IGN]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live wrestling events==
In the late 1980s, Z Channel broadcast a number of the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]'s live events from the [[Los Angeles Sports Arena]], but nowhere near as many as [[Madison Square Garden]] ([[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]]), [[Boston Garden]] ([[New England Sports Network]]) or the [[Wachovia Spectrum|Philadelphia Spectrum]] ([[Prism (TV channel)|PRISM]]).
