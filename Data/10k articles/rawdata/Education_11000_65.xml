The '''Association for Student Conduct Administration (ASCA)''' (formerly the '''Association for Student Judicial Affairs''') is the leading voice for [[student affairs|student conduct]] administration within [[higher education]], conflict resolution, law and [[public policy]] related to student conduct administration.  ASCA also attracts members who work in higher education [[health education|prevention education]] and [[Title IX]] administrators in the [[United States of America|United States]].  Founded in 1987 ASCA has over 3,000 members at over 1,000 institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASCA About Page|url=http://www.theasca.org/about_asca|website=Association for Student Conduct Administration|publisher=Association for Student Conduct Administration|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASCA's headquarters reside on the campus of [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in [[College Station, Texas]], with a satellite office on [[Dupont Circle]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASCA Contact Page|url=http://www.theasca.org/contact_us|website=Association for Student Conduct Administration|publisher=Administration for Student Conduct Administration|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The mission statement of ASCA is to support higher education professionals by providing education materials and resources, intentional professional development opportunities and a network of colleagues to facilitate best practices of student conduct administration and conflict resolution on college and university campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About ASCA|url=http://www.theasca.org/about_asca|website=Association for Student Conduct Administration|publisher=Association for Student Conduct Administration|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The creation of the Association for Student Judicial Affairs was spearheaded by Donald D. Gehring of the [[University of Louisville]] in conversations with colleagues at the [[Stetson University]] Law and Higher Education Conference.  ASJA officially came to form in 1987 with the creation of a steering committee and funding support from Raymond Goldstone of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About ASCA|url=http://www.theasca.org/about_asca|website=Association for Student Conduct Administration|publisher=Association for Student Conduct Administration|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASJA held its first annual conference in 1989 and began the annual Donald D. Gehring Academy for Student Conduct Administration in 1993.  In 2008, ASJA changed its name to the Association for Student Conduct Administration (ASCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASCA History|url=http://www.theasca.org/files/history%20for%20website.pdf|website=Association for Student Conduct Administration|publisher=Association for Student Conduct Administration|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, ASCA opened a satellite office in [[Washington, D.C.]], in collaboration with the [[American College Personnel Association]], to facilitate more interaction with other higher education professional associations and to assist public policy advocacy efforts.

==Professional development==
ASCA produces several national professional development programs each year, including an annual conference, the Donald D. Gehring Academy for Student Conduct Administration, a [[Title IX]] and Sexual Misconduct Institute, as well as national collaborations with other professional associations such as [[NASPA - Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education|NASPA]], the [[Association of Fraternity Advisors]], and the [[National Association for Campus Activities]].

==Structure and communities of practice==
ASCA is organizationally divided into four geographic regions administered by regional chairs with each state having a state coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASCA Regions|url=http://www.theasca.org/coordinators|website=Association for Student Conduct Administration|publisher=Association for Student Conduct Administration|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The association sponsors committees and communities of practice on topics such as [[conflict resolution]], research, [[academic integrity]], [[Educational assessment|assessment]], [[community college]]s, [[fraternity]] and [[sorority]] life, [[public policy]] and legislative issues, [[mental health]], [[threat assessment]] and [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASCA Communities of Practice|url=http://www.theasca.org/comm_practice|website=Association for Student Conduct Administration|publisher=Association for Student Conduct Administration|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy efforts==
After the release of the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] (OCR) "Dear Colleague Letter" discussing [[Title IX]] and campus [[sexual assault]] in April 2011, ASCA leadership and publications were frequently cited in the national media to discuss topics related to sexual assault response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grassgreen|first1=Allie|title=Tide Shifts on Title IX|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/04/24/ocr-dear-colleague-letter-prompts-big-change-sexual-assault-hearings-unc|website=Inside Higher Ed|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grassgreen|first1=Allie|title=Deadlines for Campus Justice|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/10/09/duke-eliminates-statute-limitations-sex-assault-cases-after-confusion-ocr|website=Inside Higher Ed|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ASCA has voiced support for the OCR-required [[preponderance of the evidence]] standard in campus sexual assault adjudications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASCA 2014 White Paper: Student Conduct Administration &amp; Title IX: Gold Standard Practices for Resolution of Allegations of Sexual Misconduct on College Campuses|url=http://www.theasca.org/Files/Publications/ASCA%202014%20White%20Paper.pdf|website=Association for Student Conduct Administration|publisher=Association for Student Conduct Administration|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bruell|first1=Alex|title=Combating Sexual Assault in Schools|url=http://www.dailyuw.com/features/article_ae1ac346-301b-11e5-a42b-877cd0e34842.html|website=The Daily|publisher=The Daily|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; mandatory academic transcript notation for serious disciplinary matters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Transcript notations can help institutions reduce foreseeable risk|journal=Student Affairs Today|date=September 2014|volume=17|issue=6|page=1|url=http://www.theasca.org/files/Publications/transcriptnotationsarticle_SAT_17_06.pdf|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Valenti|first1=Jessica|title=College rapists should not be able to transfer schools to skip consequences|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/29/college-rapists-should-not-be-able-to-transfer-schools-to-skip-consequences|accessdate=22 July 2015|agency=The Guardian|date=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and advocacy for institutionally-based discipline processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McMurtrie|first1=Beth|title=With Fraternities Under Scrutiny, Greek Lobbyists Take to Capitol Hill|url=http://chronicle.com/article/With-Fraternities-Under/229749/|accessdate=22 July 2015|agency=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bennett|first1=Laura|title=When the Student Culture Changes|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Sexual-Assault-on-Campus-9/229279/|accessdate=22 July 2015|agency=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASCA has received criticism from popular media outlets [[Huffington Post]] and [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] for a perceived focus on educational outcomes in campus sexual assault adjudication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kingkade|first1=Tyler|title=Many Universities Don't Want You To Know How They Punish Sexual Assault|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/29/punish-sexual-assault_n_5894856.html|accessdate=22 July 2015|agency=The Huffington Post|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beusman|first1=Callie|title=Colleges Rarely Expel Students Found Responsible for Sexual Assault|url=http://jezebel.com/colleges-rarely-expel-students-found-responsible-for-se-1640310795|accessdate=22 July 2015|agency=Jezebel|publisher=Gawker Media|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASCA responded to those concerns with the publication of a "Gold Standard" report on sexual assault adjudication practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASCA 2014 White Paper: Student Conduct Administration &amp; Title IX: Gold Standard Practices for Resolution of Allegations of Sexual Misconduct on College Campuses|url=http://www.theasca.org/Files/Publications/ASCA%202014%20White%20Paper.pdf|website=Association for Student Conduct Administration|publisher=Association for Student Conduct Administration|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hamlin|first1=Kelsey|title=Office for Civil Rights investigates UW for handling of sexual assault cases|url=http://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_1d571e74-1a25-11e5-b973-13257c4e7278.html|accessdate=22 July 2015|agency=The Daily|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
The Raymond Goldstone ASCA Foundation provides funds for scholarships to ASCA professional development opportunities such as the annual conference or Gehring Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASCA Goldstone Foundation|url=http://www.theasca.org/foundation|website=Association for Student Conduct Administration|publisher=Association for Student Conduct Administration|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Auditory processing disorder''' ('''APD'''), also known as '''central auditory processing disorder''' ('''CAPD'''), is an umbrella term for a variety of disorders that affect the way the brain processes [[Sound|auditory]] information.&lt;ref name="AAA, 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=American Academy of Audiology|title=Clinical Practice Guidelines: Diagnosis, Treatment and Management of Children and Adults with Central Auditory|url=http://audiology-web.s3.amazonaws.com/migrated/CAPD%20Guidelines%208-2010.pdf_539952af956c79.73897613.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with APD usually have normal structure and function of the outer, middle, and inner ear (peripheral hearing). However, they cannot process the information they hear in the same way as others do, which leads to difficulties in recognizing and interpreting sounds, especially the sounds composing speech. It is thought that these difficulties arise from dysfunction in the [[central nervous system]].

The American Academy of Audiology notes that APD is diagnosed by difficulties in one or more auditory processes known to reflect the function of the central auditory nervous system.&lt;ref name="AAA, 2010" /&gt;

APD can affect both children and adults, although the actual prevalence is currently unknown. It has been suggested that males are twice as likely to be affected by the disorder as females,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/hcs/resources/capd/capd/index.html |title=(C)APD|author= La Trobe University |accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Musiek |first1=Frank |authorlink1= |last2=Gail |first2=Chermak |authorlink2= |title=Handbook of central auditory processing disorder |trans-title=auditory neuroscience and diagnosis |year= 2007|publisher= Plural Publishing|isbn= 1-59756-056-1|pages= 448}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are no good epidemiological studies.

==Presentation ==
CAPD can continue into adulthood. Cooper and Gates (1991) estimated the prevalence of adult APD to be 10 to 20%.&lt;ref&gt;(Cooper JC Jr., Gates GA.

===Relation to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder===

It has been discovered that APD and [[ADHD]] present overlapping symptoms. Below is a ranked order of behavioral symptoms that are most frequently observed in each disorder. Professionals evaluated the overlap of symptoms between the two disorders. The order below is of symptoms that are almost always observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chermak|first1=Gail D.|last2=Somers|first2=Erin K.|last3=Seikel|first3=J. Anthony|title=Behavioral signs of central auditory processing disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|journal=Journal of American Academy of Audiology|date=1998|page=78-84}}&lt;/ref&gt; This chart proves that although the symptoms listed are different, it is easy to get confused between many of them.

There is a high rate of co-occurrence between AD/HD and CAPD. An article published in 1994 showed that 84% of children with APD have confirmed or suspected ADHD. Co-occurrence between ADHD and APD is 41% for children with confirmed diagnosis of ADHD, and 43% for children suspected of having ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=RICCIO|first1=CYNTHIA A.|last2=HYND|first2=GEORGE W.|last3=COHEN|first3=MORRIS J.|last4=HALL|first4=JOSH|last5=MOLT|first5=LAWRENCE|title=Comorbidity of Central Auditory Processing Disorder and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|date=July 1994|volume=33|issue=6|pages=849–857|doi=10.1097/00004583-199407000-00011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''more recently published data is needed to support or refute this statement.'' 
===Relation to specific language impairment and developmental dyslexia===

There has been considerable debate over the relationship between APD and [[Specific language impairment|Specific language impairment (SLI)]].

SLI is diagnosed when a child has difficulties with understanding or producing spoken language for no obvious cause. The problems cannot be explained in terms of peripheral hearing loss. The child is typically late in starting to talk, and may have problems in producing speech sounds clearly, and in producing or understanding complex sentences. Some theoretical accounts of SLI regard it as the result of auditory processing problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=C. A.|year=2011|title= Auditory processing theories of language disorders: Past, present, and future.|journal=Language Speech and Hearing Services in Schools|volume=42|issue=3|pages=309–319|doi= 10.1044/0161-1461(2011/10-0040)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferguson, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1= M. A.|last2=Hall|first2=R. L.|last3= Riley|first3=A|last4= Moore|first4= D. R.|year=2011|title=Communication, listening, cognitive and speech perception skills in children with auditory processing disorder (APD) or specific language impairment (SLI)|journal=Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research|volume= 54|issue=1|pages=211–227| doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2010/09-0167)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view of SLI is not universally accepted, and others regard the main difficulties in SLI as stemming from problems with higher-level aspects of language processing. Where a child has both auditory and language problems, it can be hard to sort out cause-and-effect.&lt;ref name="Ferguson, 2011"/&gt;

Similarly with [[dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]], there has been considerable interest in the idea that for some children reading problems are downstream consequences of difficulties in rapid auditory processing. Again, cause and effect can be hard to unravel. This is one reason why experts such as Moore&lt;ref name='D.R.Moore (2006)'/&gt; have recommended using non-verbal auditory tests to diagnose APD. Specifically regarding the neurological factors of dyslexia, the disorder has been linked to [[polymicrogyria]] which causes cell migrational problems. This relates to APD because children that have polymicrogyri almost always present deficits on APD testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chermak|first1=Gail|last2=Musiek|first2=Frank|title=Handbook of central auditory processing disorder. comprehensive intervention|date=2014|publisher=Plural Publishing|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-1-59756-562-2|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that APD may be related to [[cluttering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pindzola, Rebekah H. |author2=Haynes, William O. |author3=Moran, Michael J. |title=Communication disorders in the classroom: an introduction for professionals in school setting |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |location=Boston |year=2006 |pages=251 |isbn=0-7637-2743-1 |oclc=59401841 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fluency disorder marked by word and phrase repetitions.

It has been found that a higher than expected proportion of individuals diagnosed with SLI and dyslexia on the basis of language and reading tests also perform poorly on tests in which APD is tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=David R.|title=Auditory processing disorders: Acquisition and treatment|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|date=July 2007|volume=40|issue=4|pages=295–304|doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2007.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; APD can be assessed using tests that involve identifying, repeating or discriminating speech, and a child may do poorly because of primary language problems.&lt;ref name='Dawes &amp; Bishop(2009)'/&gt; In a study comparing children with a diagnosis of dyslexia and those with a diagnosis of APD, they found the two groups could not be distinguished.&lt;ref name="Ferguson, 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dawes|first1=P|last2=Bishop|first2= D|year=2010|title=Psychometric profile of children with auditory processing disorder (APD) and children with dyslexia|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|volume=95|pages=432–436|doi=10.1136/adc.2009.170118|pmid=20501538|pmc=3576918}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller|first1= C.A.|last2=Wagstaff|first2=D.A.|year=2011 |title=Behavioral profiles associated with auditory processing disorder and specific language impairment.|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|volume=44|issue=6|pages=745–763 |doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2011.04.001|pmc=3174343}}&lt;/ref&gt; obtained similar findings in studies comparing children diagnosed with SLI or APD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Corriveau K, Pasquini E, Goswami U |title=Basic auditory processing skills and specific language impairment: a new look at an old hypothesis |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=647–66 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17538107 |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2007/046) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dlouha O, Novak A, Vokral J |title=Central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) in children with specific language impairment (SLI).

This raises the worrying possibility that the diagnosis that a child receives may be largely a function of the specialist they see: the same child who would be diagnosed with APD by an audiologist may be diagnosed with SLI by a speech-language therapist or with dyslexia by a psychologist.&lt;ref name='D.R.Moore (2006)'/&gt;

==Causes==

===Acquired auditory processing disorder===
Acquired APD can be caused by any damage to or dysfunction of the central auditory nervous system and can cause auditory processing problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Musiek FE, Chermak GD, Weihing J, Zappulla M, Nagle S |title=Diagnostic accuracy of established central auditory processing test batteries in patients with documented brain lesions |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=342–58 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21864472 |doi=10.3766/jaaa.22.6.4 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lew HL, Weihing J, Myers PJ, Pogoda TK, Goodrich GL |title=Dual sensory impairment (DSI) in traumatic brain injury (TBI)--An emerging interdisciplinary challenge |journal=NeuroRehabilitation |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=213–22 |year=2010 |pmid=20448311 |doi=10.3233/NRE-2010-0557 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an overview of neurological aspects of APD, see Griffiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffiths|first=T. D.|year=2002|title=Central auditory pathologies. |journal=British Medical Bulletin|volume=63|issue=1|pages=107–120| doi=10.1093/bmb/63.1.107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hereditary and genetic characteristics of central auditory processing disorder===
The ability to listen to and comprehend multiple messages at the same time is a trait that is heavily influenced by our genes say federal researchers.&lt;ref&gt;("Genetics Influence Auditory Processing." Psych Central.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 02 Dec. 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt; These "short circuits in the wiring" sometimes run in families or result from a difficult birth, just like any learning disability.&lt;ref&gt;(NCLD.org – NCLD." National Center for Learning Disabilities | NCLD.org.)&lt;/ref&gt; Auditory processing disorder can be associated with conditions affected by genetic traits, such as various developmental disorders. Inheritance of Auditory Processing Disorder refers to whether the condition is inherited from your parents or "runs" in families.&lt;ref&gt;("Inheritance and Genetics of Auditory Processing Disorder." – RightDiagnosis.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 02 Dec. 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Central auditory processing disorder may be hereditary neurological traits from the mother or the father.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Developmental auditory processing disorder===
In the majority of cases of developmental APD, the cause is unknown. An exception is acquired epileptic [[aphasia]] or [[Landau-Kleffner syndrome]], where a child's development regresses, with language comprehension severely affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fandiño M, Connolly M, Usher L, Palm S, Kozak FK |title=Landau-Kleffner syndrome: a rare auditory processing disorder series of cases and review of the literature |journal=Int.

[[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] begins [[in utero]], but the [[central auditory system]] continues to develop for at least the first decade.&lt;ref name="Moore, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moore DR |title=Auditory development and the role of experience |journal=British Medical Bulletin |volume=63 |issue= |pages=171–81 |year=2002 |pmid=12324392 |doi= 10.1093/bmb/63.1.171|url=http://bmb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12324392}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable interest in the idea that disruption to hearing during a sensitive period may have long-term consequences for auditory development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thai-Van H, Veuillet E, Norena A, Guiraud J, Collet L |title=Plasticity of tonotopic maps in humans: influence of hearing loss, hearing aids and cochlear implants |journal=Acta Otolaryngol. |volume=130 |issue=3 |pages=333–7 |date=March 2010 |pmid=19845491 |doi=10.3109/00016480903258024 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed thalamocortical connectivity [[in vitro]] was associated with a time sensitive developmental window and required a specific [[cell adhesion molecule]] (lcam5) for proper [[brain plasticity]] to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barkat TR, Polley DB, Hensch TK |title=A critical period for auditory thalamocortical connectivity |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=1189–94 |date=September 2011 |pmid=21804538 |doi=10.1038/nn.2882 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn.2882 |pmc=3419581}}&lt;/ref&gt; This points to connectivity between the [[thalamus]] and [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] shortly after being able to hear (in vitro) as at least one critical period for auditory processing.

In the 1980s and 1990s, there was considerable interest in the role of chronic [[Otitis media]] (middle ear disease or 'glue ear') in causing APD and related language and literacy problems. Otitis media with effusion is a very common childhood disease that causes a fluctuating conductive hearing loss, and there was concern this may disrupt auditory development if it occurred during a sensitive period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whitton JP, Polley DB |title=Evaluating the perceptual and pathophysiological consequences of auditory deprivation in early postnatal life: a comparison of basic and clinical studies |journal=J.

Compared with hospital studies, epidemiological studies, which assesses a whole population for otitis media and then evaluate outcomes, have found much weaker evidence for long-term impacts of otitis media on language outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feldman|first1=H.M.|year=2003|title=Parent-reported language skills in relation to otitis media during the first 3 years of life|journal=Journal of Speech, Language and Hearing Research|volume=46|pages=273–287|doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2003/022)|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Questionnaires for identifying or documenting listening problems. ==
Questionnaires can be used for the identification persons with possible auditory processing disorders, as these address common problems of listening. They can help in the decision for pursuing clinical evaluation. One of the most common listening problems is speech recognition in the presence of background noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jerger |first1=James |last2=Musiek |first2=Frank |title=Report of the Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis of Auditory Processing Disorders in School-Aged Children. |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Audiology |date=October 2000 |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=467-74 |pmid=11057730 |url=https://www.audiology.org/sites/default/files/journal/JAAA_11_09_01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asha.org/policy/PS2005-00114/|author1=Working Group on Auditory Processing Disorders |website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|title=(Central) Auditory Processing Disorders—The Role of the Audiologist [Position Statement] |date=2005 |doi=10.1044/policy.PS2005-00114}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the respondents who participated in a study by Neijenhuis, de Wit, and Luinge (2017),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Neijenhuis |first1=Karin |last2=de Wit |first2=Ellen |last3=Luinge |first3=Margreet |title=Perspectives of Dutch health professionals regarding auditory processing disorders; a focus group study |journal=International Journal of Audiology |date=13 July 2017 |volume=56 |issue=12 |pages=942–950 |doi=10.1080/14992027.2017.1347290 |pmid=28701055}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following symptoms are characteristic in children with listening difficulties, and they are typically problematic with adolescents and adults. They include:

* Difficulty hearing in noise
* Auditory attention problems
* Better understanding in one on one situations
* Difficulties in noise localization
* Difficulties in remembering oral information

According to the New Zealand Guidelines on Auditory Processing Disorders (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Keith, W.J., Purdy, S.C., Baily, M., Kay, Flora.  Draft of New Zealand APD Guidelines on Auditory Processing Disorder (2018) Published by the Auditory Processing Disorders Reference Group, New Zealand Audiological Society.  &lt;/ref&gt; a checklist of key symptoms of APD or comorbidities that can be used to identify individuals who should be referred for audiological and APD assessment includes, among others:

* Difficulty following spoken directions unless they are brief and simple
* Difficulty attending to and remembering spoken information
* Slowness in processing spoken information
* Difficulty understanding in the presence of other sounds
*Overwhelmed by complex or “busy” auditory environments e.g. classrooms, shopping malls
*Poor listening skills
* Insensitivity to tone of voice or other nuances of speech
*Acquired brain injury
*History of frequent or persistent middle ear disease (otitis media, ‘glue ear’).
*Difficulty with language, reading or spelling
*Suspicion or diagnosis of dyslexia
*Suspicion or diagnosis of language disorder or delay

Finally, the New Zealand guidelines state that behavioral checklists and questionnaires should only be used to provide guidance for referrals, for information gathering (for example, prior to assessment or as outcome measures for interventions), and as measures to describe the functional impact of auditory processing disorder.  They are not designed for the purpose of diagnosing auditory processing disorders. The New Zealand guidelines indicate that a number of questionnaires have been developed to identify children who might benefit from evaluation of their problems in listening.  Examples of available questionnaires include the Fisher’s Auditory Problems Checklist (1976&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, L. I. (1976). ''Fisher’s Auditory Problems Checklist''. Tampa, FL .

(2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Del Zoppo|first=C.|last2=Sanchez, L.|last3=Lind, C.|date=2015|title=A long-term follow-up of children and adolescents referred for assessment of auditory processing disorder.|url=|journal=International Journal of Audiology|volume=54|pages=368-375|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) a 34-item questionnaire was developed that investigates auditory processing abilities in each of the six common areas of complaint in APD (listening and concentration, understanding speech, following spoken instructions, attention, and other.)  The final questionnaire was standardized on normally achieving young adults ranging from 18 to 27 years of age.  Validation data was acquired from subjects with language-learning or auditory processing disorders who were either self-reported or confirmed by diagnostic testing.  A UCAPI  total score is calculated by combining the totals from the six listening conditions and provides an overall value to categorize listening abilities. Additionally, analysis of the scores from the six listening conditions provides an auditory profile for the subject. Each listening condition can then be utilized by the professional in making recommendation for diagnosing problem of learning through listening and treatment decisions.  The UCAPI provides information on listening problems in various populations that can aid examiners in making recommendations for assessment and management.

==Diagnosis==
APD is a difficult disorder to detect and diagnose. The subjective symptoms that lead to an evaluation for APD include an intermittent inability to process verbal information, leading the person to guess to fill in the processing gaps. There may also be disproportionate problems with decoding speech in noisy environments.

APD has been defined anatomically in terms of the integrity of the auditory areas of the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rintelmann | first1 = W.F. | title = Assessment of central auditory dysfunction : foundations and clinical correlates | chapter = Monaural speech tests in the detection of central auditory disorders. | editors = Marilyn L Pinheiro and Frank E Musiek | publisher = Williams &amp; Wilkins | year = 1985 | location = Baltimore  | pages = 173–200 | isbn = 978-0-683-06887-0 | oclc= 11497885 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, children with symptoms of APD typically have no evidence of neurological disease and the diagnosis is made on the basis of performance on behavioral auditory tests. Auditory processing is "what we do with what we hear",&lt;ref name='Katz 1992'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Katz | first1 = Jack  | title = Central auditory processing : a transdisciplinary view  | chapter = Classification of auditory processing disorders | editors = Jack Katz and Nancy Austin Stecker and Donald Henderson  | publisher = Mosby Year Book | year = 1992 | location = St. Louis | pages = 81–92 | isbn = 978-1-55664-372-9| oclc= 25877287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in APD there is a mismatch between peripheral hearing ability (which is typically normal) and ability to interpret or discriminate sounds. Thus in those with no signs of neurological impairment, APD is diagnosed on the basis of auditory tests. There is, however, no consensus as to which tests should be used for diagnosis, as evidenced by the succession of task force reports that have appeared in recent years. The first of these occurred in 1996.&lt;ref name=cap1996/&gt; This was followed by a conference organized by the American Academy of Audiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jerger J, Musiek F |title=Report of the Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis of Auditory Processing Disorders in School-Aged Children |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=467–74 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11057730 |doi= |url=http://www.taracentar.hr/download/diagnosis_apd_school.pdf |format=pdf }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts attempting to define diagnostic criteria have to grapple with the problem that a child may do poorly on an auditory test for reasons other than poor auditory perception: for instance, failure could be due to inattention, difficulty in coping with task demands, or limited language ability. In an attempt to rule out at least some of these factors, the American Academy of Audiology conference explicitly advocated that for APD to be diagnosed, the child must have a modality-specific problem, i.e. affecting auditory but not visual processing. However, an ASHA committee subsequently rejected modality-specificity as a defining characteristic of auditory processing disorders.&lt;ref name='ASHA 2005'/&gt;

Auditory processing disorder can be developmental or acquired. It may result from ear infections, head injuries or neurodevelopmental delays that affect processing of auditory information. This can include problems with: "...[[sound localization]] and lateralization (see also [[binaural fusion]]); auditory discrimination; auditory pattern recognition; temporal aspects of audition, including temporal integration, temporal discrimination (e.g., temporal gap detection), temporal ordering, and [[temporal masking]]; auditory performance in competing acoustic signals (including [[dichotic listening]]); and auditory performance with degraded acoustic signals".&lt;ref name='ASHA 2005'&gt;{{cite web |title      = (Central) Auditory Processing Disorders.

The Committee of UK Medical Professionals Steering the UK Auditory Processing Disorder Research Program have developed the following working definition of Auditory Processing Disorder: "APD results from impaired neural function and is characterized by poor recognition, discrimination, separation, grouping, localization, or ordering of speech sounds. It does not solely result from a deficit in general attention, language or other cognitive processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebsa.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=29 |title= The British Society of Audiology and the UK APD Steering Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of testing===
1. The SCAN-C&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=Robert W.|date=2000|title=SCAN-C Test for Auditory Processing Dis- orders in Children|journal=Revised, Psychological Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; for children and SCAN-A&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keith|first=Robert|date=2009|title=SCAN-3:A Tests for Auditory Processing Disorders in Adolescents and Adults.|url=https://www.pearson.com/us/|journal=|publisher=Pearson US|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for adolescents and adults are the most common tool for screening and diagnosing APD in the USA.   Both tests are standardized on a large number of subjects and include validation data on subjects with auditory processing disorders.   The test batteries include screening tests: norm-based criterion-referenced scores; diagnostic tests: scaled scores, percentile ranks and ear advantage scores for all tests except the Gap Detection test.  The four tests include four subsets on which the subject scores are derived include: discrimination of monaurally presented single words against background noise (speech in noise), acoustically degraded single words (filtered words), dichotically presented single words and sentences. 

2. Random Gap Detection Test (RGDT) is also a standardized test. It assesses an individual’s gap detection threshold of tones and white noise. The exam includes stimuli at four different frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz) and white noise clicks of 50 ms duration. It is a useful test because it provides an index of auditory temporal resolution. In children, an overall gap detection threshold greater than 20 ms means they have failed and may have an auditory processing disorder based on abnormal perception of sound in the time domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muluk|first=Nuray Bayar|last2=Yalçınkaya|first2=Fulya|last3=Keith|first3=Robert W.|date=February 2011|title=Random gap detection test and random gap detection test-expanded: Results in children with previous language delay in early childhood|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0385814610001446|journal=Auris Nasus Larynx|volume=38|issue=1|pages=6–13|doi=10.1016/j.anl.2010.05.007|issn=0385-8146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=Robert W.|title=Random gap detection test|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3. Gaps in Noise Test (GIN) also measures temporal resolution by testing the patient's gap detection threshold in white noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Musiek|first1=Frank E.|last2=Shinn|first2=Jennifer B.|last3=Jirsa|first3=Robert|last4=Bamiou|first4=Doris-Eva|last5=Baran|first5=Jane A.|last6=Zaida|first6=Elena|title=GIN (Gaps-In-Noise) Test Performance in Subjects with Confirmed Central Auditory Nervous System Involvement|journal=Ear and Hearing|date=December 2005|volume=26|issue=6|pages=608–618|doi=10.1097/01.aud.0000188069.80699.41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4. Pitch Patterns Sequence Test (PPT) and Duration Patterns Sequence Test (DPT) measure auditory pattern identification. The PPS has s series of three tones presented at either of two pitches (high or low). Meanwhile, the DPS has a series of three tones that vary in duration rather than pitch (long or short). Patients are then asked to describe the pattern of pitches presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Musiek|first1=Frank|title=Frequency (Pitch) and Duration Pattern Tests|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Audiology|date=1994|page=265-268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modality-specificity and controversies===

The issue of modality-specificity has led to considerable debate among experts in this field.  Cacace and McFarland have argued that APD should be defined as a ''modality-specific'' perceptual dysfunction that is not due to peripheral hearing loss.&lt;ref name='Cacace McFarland 1995'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Opening Pandora's Box: The Reliability of CAPD Tests | journal = American Journal of Audiology | date = July 1995 | first = Anthony T. | last = Cacace | author2 = Dennis J.

It is also impractical, as audiologists do not have access to standardized tests that are visual analogs of auditory tests. The debate over this issue remains unresolved. It is clear, however, that a modality-specific approach will diagnose fewer children with APD than a modality-general one, and that the latter approach runs a risk of including children who fail auditory tests for reasons other than poor auditory processing. Although modality-specific testing has been advocated for well over a decade, to date no tests have been published which would allow audiologists to perform a modality-specific evaluation (i.e., no clinical versions of visual analogs to auditory processing tests exist).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Another controversy concerns the fact that most traditional tests of APD use verbal materials.&lt;ref name="D.R.Moore (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=David R.|year=2006|title=Auditory processing disorder (APD): Definition, diagnosis, neural basis, and intervention|journal=Audiological Medicine|volume=4|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1080/16513860600568573}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2010-08-31--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The British Society of Audiology&lt;ref name='BSA2011'/&gt; has embraced Moore's (2006) recommendation that tests for APD should assess processing of ''non-speech sounds''.&lt;ref name='D.R.Moore (2006)'/&gt; The concern is that if verbal materials are used to test for APD, then children may fail because of limited language ability. An analogy may be drawn with trying to listen to sounds in a foreign language. It is much harder to distinguish between sounds or to remember a sequence of words in a language you do not know well: the problem is not an auditory one, but rather due to lack of expertise in the language.

In recent years there have been additional criticisms of some popular tests for diagnosis of APD. Tests that use tape-recorded American English have been shown to over-identify APD in speakers of other forms of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The SCAN-C in testing for auditory processing disorder in a sample of British children.|first1=P|last1=Dawes |first2=D.V. M.|last2=Bishop|year=2007|journal=International Journal of Audiology|volume=46|pages=780–786|doi=10.1080/14992020701545906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance on a battery of non-verbal auditory tests devised by the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]'s Institute of Hearing Research was found to be heavily influenced by non-sensory task demands, and indices of APD had low reliability when this was controlled for.&lt;ref name='Moore2010'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nature of auditory processing disorder in children.|first1=D.R.|last1=Moore|first2=M.A.|last2=Ferguson|first3=A.M.|last3=Edmondson-Jones|first4=S|last4=Ratib|first5=A|last5=Riley|year=2010|journal=Pediatrics|volume=126|issue=2|pages=e382-390|doi=10.1542/peds.2009-2826}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Moore2011'&gt;{{cite journal|title= Development of auditory processing in 6-11 year old children.|first1=D.R.|last1=Moore|first2=J.A.|last2=Cowan|first3=A|last3=Riley|first4=A.M.|last4=Edmondson-Jones|first5= M.A.|last5=Ferguson|year=2011|journal=Ear and Hearing|volume=32|issue=3|pages=269–285|doi=10.1097/AUD.0b013e318201c468}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research undermines the validity of APD as a distinct entity in its own right and suggests that the use of the term "disorder" itself is unwarranted. In a recent review of such diagnostic issues, it was recommended that children with suspected auditory processing impairments receive a holistic psychometric assessment including general intellectual ability, auditory memory, and attention, phonological processing, language, and literacy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |title= Controversies in central auditory processing disorder |veditors=Cacace AT, McFarland DJ |chapter= Putting the Auditory Processing Back into Auditory Processing Disorder in Children |vauthors=Cowan J, Rosen S, Moore DR |pages=187–197 |year=2009 |publisher= San Diego, Calif.; Abingdon: Plural. |isbn=978-159-756260-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors state that "a clearer understanding of the relative contributions of perceptual and non-sensory, unimodal and supramodal factors to performance on psychoacoustic tests may well be the key to unravelling the clinical presentation of these individuals."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Depending on how it is defined, APD may share common symptoms with [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADD/ADHD]], [[specific language impairment]], and [[autism spectrum]] disorders. A review showed substantial evidence for atypical processing of auditory information in children with autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Connor K |title=Auditory processing in autism spectrum disorder: A review |journal=Neurosci Biobehav Rev |volume= 36|issue= 2|pages= 836–54|date=December 2011 |pmid=22155284 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2011.11.008 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawes and Bishop noted how specialists in audiology and speech-language pathology often adopted different approaches to child assessment, and they concluded their review as follows: "We regard it as crucial that these different professional groups work together in carrying out assessment, treatment and management of children and undertaking cross-disciplinary research."&lt;ref name='Dawes &amp; Bishop(2009)'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dawes P, Bishop D |title=Auditory processing disorder in relation to developmental disorders of language, communication and attention: a review and critique |journal=Int J Lang Commun Disord |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=440–65 |year=2009 |pmid=19925352 |doi=10.1080/13682820902929073 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, this seems rare.

To ensure that APD is correctly diagnosed, the examiners must differentiate APD from other disorders with similar symptoms. Factors that should be taken into account during the diagnosis are: attention, [[auditory neuropathy]], fatigue, hearing and sensitivity, intellectual and developmental age, medications, motivation, motor skills, native language and language experience, response strategies and decision-making style, and [[visual acuity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jerger|first1=James|last2=Musick|first2=Frank|title=Report of the Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis of Auditory Processing Disorders in School-Aged Children|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Audiology|date=2000|volume=11|issue=9|pages=467–474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that children under the age of seven cannot be evaluated correctly because their language and auditory processes are still developing. In addition, the presence of APD cannot be evaluated when a child's primary language is not English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brandstaetter|first1=Patt|last2=Hunter|first2=Lisa|last3=Kalweit|first3=Linda|last4=Kloos|first4=Eric|last5=Landrud|first5=Sherry|last6=Larson|first6=Nancy|last7=Packer|first7=Amy|last8=Wall|first8=Deb|title=Introduction to Auditory Processing Disorders|journal=Minnesota Department of Education Total Special Education System|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* have trouble paying attention to and remembering information presented orally, and may cope better with visually acquired information
* have problems carrying out multi-step directions given orally; need to hear only one direction at a time
* have poor [[listening]] skills
* need more time to process information
* have low academic performance 
* have behavior problems
* have language difficulties (e.g., they confuse syllable sequences and have problems developing vocabulary and understanding language)
* have difficulty with reading, comprehension, spelling, and vocabulary

APD can manifest as problems determining the direction of sounds, difficulty perceiving differences between speech sounds and the sequencing of these sounds into meaningful words, confusing similar sounds such as "hat" with "bat", "there" with "where", etc.  Fewer words may be perceived than were actually said, as there can be problems detecting the gaps between words, creating the sense that someone is speaking unfamiliar or nonsense words. In addition, it is common for APD to cause speech errors involving the distortion and substitution of consonant sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeVore|first1=Brooke|last2=Nagao|first2=Kyoko|last3=Pereira|first3=Olivia|last4=Nemith|first4=Julianne|last5=Sklar|first5=Rachele|last6=Deeves|first6=Emily|last7=Kish|first7=Emily|last8=Welsh|first8=Kelsey|last9=Morlet|first9=Thierry|title=Speech errors among children with auditory processing disorder|journal=Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics|date=2016|volume=29|issue=1|page=6|doi=10.1121/2.0000440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those suffering from APD may have problems relating what has been said with its meaning, despite obvious recognition that a word has been said, as well as repetition of the word.  Background noise, such as the sound of a radio, television or a noisy bar can make it difficult to impossible to understand speech, since spoken words may sound distorted either into irrelevant words or words that don't exist, depending on the severity of the auditory processing disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson S, Kraus N |title=Sensory-cognitive interaction in the neural encoding of speech in noise: a review |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=575–85 |date=October 2010 |pmid=21241645 |pmc=3075209 |doi=10.3766/jaaa.21.9.3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a telephone can be problematic for someone with auditory processing disorder, in comparison with someone with normal auditory processing, due to low quality audio, poor signal, intermittent sounds and the chopping of words.&lt;ref name='ASHA 2005'/&gt; Many who have auditory processing disorder subconsciously develop visual coping strategies, such as lip reading, reading body language, and eye contact, to compensate for their auditory deficit, and these coping strategies are not available when using a telephone.

==Remediation and training==

{{See also|Alternative therapies for developmental and learning disabilities}}

Treatment of APD typically focuses on three primary areas: changing learning environment, developing higher-order skills to compensate for the disorder, and remediation of the auditory deficit itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bellis|first1=Teri James|title=Auditory Processing Disorders (APD) in Children|url=https://www.asha.org/public/hearing/Understanding-Auditory-Processing-Disorders-in-Children/|website=www.asha.org|publisher=ASHA|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a lack of well-conducted evaluations of intervention using [[randomized controlled trial]] methodology. Most evidence for effectiveness adopts weaker standards of evidence, such as showing that performance improves after training. This does not control for possible influences of practice, maturation, or placebo effects. Recent research has shown that practice with basic auditory processing tasks (i.e. auditory training) may improve performance on auditory processing measures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chermak GD, Silva ME, Nye J, Hasbrouck J, Musiek FE |title=An update on professional education and clinical practices in central auditory processing |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=428–52; quiz 455 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17715652 |doi= 10.3766/jaaa.18.5.7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MooreDR2007 &gt;{{cite journal |author=Moore DR |title=Auditory processing disorders: acquisition and treatment |journal=J Commun Disord |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=295–304 |year=2007 |pmid=17467002 |doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2007.03.005 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and phonemic awareness measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moore DR, Rosenberg JF, Coleman JS |title=Discrimination training of phonemic contrasts enhances phonological processing in mainstream school children |journal=Brain Lang |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=72–85 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15896385 |doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2004.11.009 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes after auditory training have also been recorded at the physiological level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Russo NM, Nicol TG, Zecker SG, Hayes EA, Kraus N |title=Auditory training improves neural timing in the human brainstem |journal=Behav.

Treating additional issues related to APD can result in success. For example, treatment for phonological disorders (difficulty in speech) can result in success in terms of both the phonological disorder as well as APD. In one study, speech therapy improved auditory [[evoked potential]]s (a measure of brain activity in the auditory portions of the brain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leite RA, Wertzner HF, Matas CG |title=Long latency auditory evoked potentials in children with phonological disorder |journal=Pró-fono : Revista De Atualização Científica |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=561–6 |year=2010 |pmid=21271117 |doi= 10.1590/s0104-56872010000400034|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0104-56872010000400034&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is evidence that language training is effective for improving APD, there is no current research supporting the following APD treatments:
* [[Auditory Integration Training]] typically involves a child attending two 30-minute sessions per day for ten days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Controversial Therapies for Developmental Disabilities|veditors=Jacobson JW, Foxx RM, Mulick JA |chapter= Auditory integration training: a critical review|vauthors=Mudford OC, Cullen C |pages=351–62|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-8058-4192-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lindamood-Bell Learning Processes (particularly, the Visualizing and Verbalizing program)
* Physical activities that require frequent crossing of the midline (e.g., [[occupational therapy]])
* Sound Field Amplification
* Neuro-Sensory Educational Therapy
*Neurofeedback

However, use of a FM transmitter has been shown to produce significant improvements over time with children.

==History==
The first research into APD began in 1954 with Helmer Myklebust's study, "Auditory Disorders in Children".&lt;ref&gt;Myklebust, H. (1954). Auditory disorders in children. New York: Grune &amp; Stratton.&lt;/ref&gt; Myklebust's work suggested auditory processing disorder was separate from [[language]] learning difficulties. His work sparked interest in auditory deficits after acquired brain lesions affecting the temporal lobes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bocca E, Calearo C, Cassinari V |title=A new method for testing hearing in temporal lobe tumours; preliminary report |journal=Acta Oto-laryngologica |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=219–21 |year=1954 |pmid=13197002 |doi= 10.3109/00016485409128700|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bocca E, Calearo C, Cassinari V, Migliavacca F |title=Testing "cortical" hearing in temporal lobe tumours |journal=Acta Oto-laryngologica |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=289–304 |year=1955 |pmid=13275293 |doi= 10.3109/00016485509124282|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and led to additional work looking at the physiological basis of auditory processing,&lt;ref name="Kimura1961"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimura|first1=Doreen|title=Cerebral dominance and the perception of verbal stimuli.|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology |

In 1977, the first conference on the topic of APD was organized by Robert W. Keith, Ph.D. at the University of Cincinnati.  The proceedings of that conference was published by Grune and Stratton under the title "Central Auditory Dysfunction" (Keith RW Ed.)  That conference started a new series of studies focusing on APD in children.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, J., &amp; Illmer, R. (1972). Auditory perception in children with learning disabilities. In J. Katz (Ed.), Handbook of clinical audiology (pp. 540–563).

These early researchers also invented many of the auditory training approaches, including interhemispheric transfer training and interaural intensity difference training. This period gave us a rough understanding of the causes and possible treatment options for APD.
Much of the work in the late nineties and 2000s has been looking to refining testing, developing more sophisticated treatment options, and looking for genetic risk factors for APD. Scientists have worked on improving behavioral tests of auditory function, [[neuroimaging]], [[electroacoustic phenomena|electroacoustic]], and [[electrophysiologic]] testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jerger J, Thibodeau L, Martin J |title=Behavioral and electrophysiologic evidence of auditory processing disorder: a twin study |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=13 |issue=8 |pages=438–60 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12371661 |doi= |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Estes RI, Jerger J, Jacobson G |title=Reversal of hemispheric asymmetry on auditory tasks in children who are poor listeners |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=59–71 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11895008 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with new technology has led to a number of software programs for auditory training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chermak GD, Musiek FE |title=Auditory training: Principles and approaches for remediation and managing auditory processing disorders |journal=Seminars in Hearing  |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=287–295  |year=2002 |ISSN=0734-0451 |pmid= |doi=10.1055/s-2002-35878 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Musiek F |title=Habilitation and management of auditory processing disorders: overview of selected procedures |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=329–42 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10385875 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With global awareness of mental disorders and increasing understanding of [[neuroscience]], auditory processing is more in the public and academic consciousness than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Task Force on Central Auditory Processing Consensus Development |title=Central auditory processing: Current status of research and implications for clinical practice  [Technical Report] |journal=American Journal of Audiology |volume=5 |issue= |pages=41–54 |year=1996 |doi=10.1044/policy.TR1996-00241 |url=http://www.asha.org/docs/html/TR1996-00241.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004220836/http://www.asha.org/docs/html/TR1996-00241.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jerger J, Musiek F |title=Report of the Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis of Auditory Processing Disorders in School-Aged Children |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=467–74 |format=pdf |date=October 2000 |pmid=11057730 |doi= |url=http://www.bsnpta.org/geeklog/public_html/filemgmt/filemgmt_data/files/Auditory_Processing_Disorders_in_Children.pdf |access-date=2012-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621224822/http://www.bsnpta.org/geeklog/public_html/filemgmt/filemgmt_data/files/Auditory_Processing_Disorders_in_Children.pdf |archive-date=2013-06-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Keith, Robert W. |title=Central auditory and language disorders in children |publisher=College-Hill Press |location=San Diego, CA |year=1981 |pages= |isbn=0-933014-74-0 |oclc=9258682 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Katz, Jack |author2=Henderson, Donald |author3=Stecker, Nancy Austin |title=Central auditory processing: a transdisciplinary view |publisher=Mosby Year Book |location=St. Louis, MO |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=1-55664-372-1 |oclc= 2587728 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Katz, Jack |author2=Stecker, Nancy Austin |title=Central auditory processing disorders: mostly management |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |location=Boston |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-205-27361-0 |oclc=246378171 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[politics]] and [[history]] the '''Black History for Action''' ('''BHA'''), founded in 1986, became a long-standing and highly regarded independent lecture and discussion forum for the [[British African-Caribbean community]] in London.

==Nature and purpose==
Notable speakers have included the Jamaican academic Dr. [[Richard Hart (Jamaican historian and politician)|Richard Hart]], Maria Florez, the Cuban ambassador to Britain, representatives of the South African [[African National Congress]] and [[Pan-African Congress]], and the Florida human-rights activist [[Omali Yeshitela]].  

Lecture topics have included: "200 years since the [[Haitian Revolution]]" (1991 season); "Black Women and the [[Garveyism|Garvey Movement]]" (1988 season) and "[[Harriet Tubman]]" (1990 season). Each lecture was followed by a public debate.

The purpose of the forum was to stimulate debate, learning and public interest in [[Pan-African]] history and politics in an atmosphere of academic and political freedom.

==Location==
BHA was held fortnightly (then monthly), primarily in [[Brixton]],&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Menezes|first1=Caroline|title=Retelling history through art – an interview with Kimathi Donkor, Studio International|url=http://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/retelling-history-through-art-an-interview-with-kimathi-donkor|website=Studio International - Visual Arts, Design and Architecture|publisher=The Studio Trust.|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also in other London locations including [[Lewisham]] and [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]]. The main venues were St Matthew (the Church of England's large chapel in the centre of Brixton), as well as Brixton Town Hall (the seat of government for the London Borough of [[Lambeth]]).

==Organisation==
Black History for Action was organised by an independent, secular management committee of invited community volunteers, prominent amongst whom was the late Afruika Bantu (formerly known as Annette Blair). The BHA's guiding principle was that, as an independent organisation, it ought not be subject to financial or political interference by corporate or government funding agencies.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

However, despite its financial independence, entrance to BHA was free. Voluntary contributions were used to pay for publicity materials and venue hire. Speakers and volunteers were not paid. Meetings were advertised in free listings sections of ''[[The Voice (newspaper)|The Voice]]'' and ''[[The Caribbean Times]]'' newspapers.

In 1987 BHA lecture facilities were greatly improved by the incorporation of a free creche. This service was provided by volunteers (who were vetted and trained by the management committee). The experience of running the creche led the management committee to form a Saturday School (now known as the [[Afruika Bantu Saturday School]], in recognition of the late community activist).

Meetings also served as a small distribution outlet for pan-African history books and pamphlets such as [[Walter Rodney]]'s ''[[How Europe Underdeveloped Africa]]'', [[Malcolm X]]'s ''On Afro-American History'' and Richard Hart's ''Black Jamaican's Struggle Against Slavery''.

The '''Braga incident''' was a 2014 [[academic scandal]] in which [[Xu Lin (Hanban)|Xu Lin]], the Director-General (''zhǔrèn'' 主任) of the Hanban and Chief Executive (''zǒnggànshi'' 总干事) of the [[Confucius Institute]] Headquarters ordered her staff to rip pages referring to Taiwanese academic institutions from the published program for the [[European Association for Chinese Studies]] July–August conference in [[Braga]], Portugal, claiming the materials were "contrary to Chinese regulations",&lt;ref name="China's Soft-Power Fail"&gt;[http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-10-07/china-s-soft-power-fail China's Soft-Power Fail], Bloomberg View, 07 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; which the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' described as the "bullying approach to academic freedom".&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijings-propaganda-lessons-1407430440 Beijing's Propaganda Lessons: Confucius Institute officials are agents of Chinese censorship], The Wall Street Journal, 7 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident led to [[Criticism of Confucius Institutes|renewed criticism of Confucius Institutes]].

== Removal of material==
On 22 July 2014, the evening before the start of the [[European Association of Chinese Studies]] (EACS) conference in [[Braga]], Portugal, Xu Lin removed four pages from the conference program and one page from the abstracts, which referred to Taiwan’s [[Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange]], a major sponsor of the conference for the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Cai, [http://www.businessspectator.com.au/article/2014/8/6/china/china-fails-soft-power-test China fails the soft-power test], [[Business Spectator]], 6 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://defence.pk/threads/china-hurts-taiwans-feelings-at-academic-conference-in-portugal.327507/ China hurts Taiwan's feelings at academic conference in Portugal], "Pakistan Defence" website, 4 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijings-propaganda-lessons-1407430440 Beijing's Propaganda Lessons: Confucius Institute officials are agents of Chinese censorship]", [[The Wall Street Journal]]", 7 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Diplomat [http://thediplomat.com/2014/08/the-undoing-of-chinas-soft-power/ The Undoing of China's Soft Power], "[[The Diplomat]]", 8 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shih Hsiu-chuan, [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/07/31/2003596335 EACS to protest Hanban’s academic meddling: source], ''[[Taipei Times]]'', 31 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201407280024.aspx China's obstruction at conference hurts cross-strait ties: Taiwan], Focus Taiwan News Channel, 28 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The EACS protested and reprinted all the deleted materials for distribution to all conference members. Roger Greatrex, president of the EACS, subsequently issued a report on the page deletions,&lt;ref&gt;Roger Greatrex, [http://www.chinesestudies.eu/index.php/432-report-the-deletion-of-pages-from-eacs-conference-materials-in-braga-july-2014 Report: The Deletion of Pages from EACS Conference materials in Braga (July 2014)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808055834/http://www.chinesestudies.eu/index.php/432-report-the-deletion-of-pages-from-eacs-conference-materials-in-braga-july-2014 |date=2014-08-08 }}, European Association for Chinese Studies, 1 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and an official letter of protest that concluded, "Such interference in the internal organization of the international conference of an independent and democratically organized non-profitable academic organization is totally unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Greatrex, [http://www.chinesestudies.eu/index.php/433-letter-of-protest-at-interference-in-eacs-conference-in-portugal-july-2014 Letter of Protest at Interference in EACS Conference in Portugal, July 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809004832/http://www.chinesestudies.eu/index.php/433-letter-of-protest-at-interference-in-eacs-conference-in-portugal-july-2014 |date=2014-08-09 }}, European Association for Chinese Studies, 1 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conference registration began on 22 July 2014, and about 100 participants received complete copies of the abstracts and program, which comprised 89 pages, including the cover and front matter. However, after Xu Lin, who was a keynote speaker, arrived that evening, she proclaimed that any mention of the Confucius China Studies Program (CCSP) sponsorship be removed from the Conference Abstracts, and ordered her entourage from Confucius Institute Headquarters to remove all conference materials and take them to the apartment of a local CI teacher. When the remaining 300 participants arrived for conference registration on 23 July, they did not receive the printed abstracts or programs but only a brief summarized schedule. After last-minute negotiations between Xu Lin and conference organizers to ensure conference members received the program, a compromise was made to allow the removal of one abstract page that mentioned the CCSP support of the conference.

On the morning of 24 July, the remaining 300 conference participants received their materials, which were now missing four printed pages: the frontispiece mentioning CCSP sponsorship in the conference abstract, and three pages from the conference program. These expurgated pages contained information of the book exhibition and library donation organized by the Taiwan [[National Central Library]], and the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eacs2014.pt/ 20th Biennial Conference EACS Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810034320/http://www.eacs2014.pt/ |date=2014-08-10 }}, original version with the censored frontispiece and pages 15/16, 19/20, and 59/60.&lt;/ref&gt; The director of the National Central Library stated that EACS officials and members had spoken out against Xu during the opening ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taiwannpfnews.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&amp;mnum=112&amp;anum=14830 European Association for Chinese Studies Offers Formal Apologies to Us], National Policy Foundation, 29 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shih Hsiu-chuan, [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/07/29/2003596160 Foundation angry over EACS brochures], ''Taipei times'', 29 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
Marshall Sahlins explained that the EACS censorship brings to light the Hanban's seriousness in enforcing its contractual provisions "the way they do in China which is not so much by going to court ... but simply by fiat".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Redden, [https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/07/24/debate-renews-over-confucius-institutes Confucius Controversies], ''Inside Higher Ed'', 24 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Redden, [https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/08/06/accounts-confucius-institute-ordered-censorship-chinese-studies-conference Accounts of Confucius Institute-ordered censorship at Chinese studies conference], Inside Higher Ed, 6 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' said that the Hanban/CI censorship has made more American, European, and Australian academics grow uneasy with CIs, and reported that when Ms. Xu met privately with foreign scholars in Shanghai, who asked specifically about the missing pages, "she denied ordering them censored."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Marquand, [http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2014/0822/Academic-flap-turns-up-heat-on-China-s-Confucius-Institutes Academic flap turns up heat on China's Confucius Institutes], ''The Christian Science Monitor'', 22 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the [[BBC]] interviewed Xu Lin in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hys6MKkJw8Y] BBC interview video]&lt;/ref&gt; When the interviewer brought up the Braga incident, Xu Lin objected and later asked for large portions of the interview to be deleted. One of the points she made in the interview is that Taiwan [[Political status of Taiwan|belongs to China]], and therefore outsiders have no business interfering. The BBC did not agree to the censorship demand.&lt;ref&gt;John Sudworth, [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-30567743], ''BBC News'', 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; "Xu Lin not only refused to answer difficult questions, she also politicised the Confucius Institutes and reinforced the idea that they are led by dogmatists," commented Gary Rawnsley, professor of Public Diplomacy at [[Aberystwyth University]], Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Marquand, [http://wwwpdic.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/bbc-interview-with-xu-lin-about.html BBC Interview with Xu Lin about Confucius Institutes], in his blog [http://wwwpdic.blogspot.co.uk/ Public Diplomacy and International Communications], 22 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported on Xu's BBC interview, and said, "Critics have argued that China’s Confucius Institutes pose a threat to academic freedom in the United States, Canada, Europe and beyond. Now the Beijing official in charge of them has confirmed it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/madam-xus-party-line-1419375797 Madam Xu’s Party Line, Beijing confirms that Confucius Institutes subvert Western academic freedom], Wall Street Journal, 23 December 2014 [behind paywall, copy [http://fofg.org/2014/12/madam-xus-party-line/ here].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Universities Leave Program===
The [[University of Chicago]], [[Pennsylvania State University]], and the [[Toronto District School Board]] left in 2014.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"&gt;[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/09/26/chicago-severs-ties-chinese-government-funded-confucius-institute Chicago to Close Confucius Institute], Inside Higher Ed, 26 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la.psu.edu/news/confucius-institute-update Confucius Institute update], Penn State College of Liberal Arts, 1 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1628071/toronto-schools-reject-tie-chinas-confucius-institute Toronto schools reject tie-up with China’s Confucius Institute], ''South China Morning Post'', 30 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, [[Stockholm University]], the first university in Europe to host a Confucius Institute, announced it was terminating the program. Press coverage of the Braga incident in the Swedish press was said to have influenced the decision. "Generally it is questionable to have, within the framework of the university, institutes that are financed by another country," said the university's chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://networks.h-net.org/node/22055/discussions/56521/stockholm-university-terminating-its-confucius-institute  Stockholm University terminating its Confucius Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edhance''' is a now inoperative [[United States|American]] [[corporation]] that operated a [[Discounts and allowances#Educational discount .28also called student discount.29|student discount]] program prior to its acquisition by BuyWithMe, Inc. The company allowed college students to register up to five existing [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] or [[MasterCard]] credit or debit cards and automatically receive discounts when shopping with participating merchants.

The company was founded in 2008 by Bjorn Larsen, KJ Gundersen, and Kris Helenek and was acquired by BuyWithMe, Inc in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/18/buywithme-acquires-card-linked-loyalty-company-edhance]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Receiving Discounts==

===Card model===
Edhance uses a registered card model to send discounts to students in the form of automatic cash back. Once a student has registered their card with Edhance any time that student uses that registered card at a participating "card model" retailer, the transaction is automatically sent to Edhance and a discount will be processed into that students Edhance account. Card model discounts are typically between 5% and 25% off.

===Online model===
In addition to the "card model" Edhance offered discounts for online deals.

==Student base==
As of June 2011, Edhance had over 2 million enrolled members.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Edhance is free for students.

==Enrollment verification==
Edhance utilized StudentsOnly enrollment verification technology &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=vcd_AAAAEBAJ&amp;d U.S. Patent 7209931]&lt;/ref&gt; to check whether or not members are currently enrolled at an accredited university or college across the United States.

Edhance was able to verify students in most cases in real time through relationships with universities. When a student was unable to be verified in real time and Edhance agent   contacted the student to verify their status using documentation  including but not limited to school transcripts, student I.D. cards, course schedules, tuition bills, etc.

==Fee Structure==
Edhance did not charge students for being part of the program. It operatedon an entirely pay for performance base with merchants and charged a commission based on student business that Edhance sends to the merchant.

==Notable merchants==
Companies like [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], [[Qdoba]], [[Fuddruckers]], [[Walmart]], [[Reebok]], [[Sephora]], [[The North Face]], [[Toshiba]], [[Puma AG|Puma]], [[Drugstore.com]], [[Adidas]] and [[PacSun]] offer student discounts via Edhance.

'''Ethical persuasion''' is a [[human being]]'s internal ability to treat others with [[respect]], understanding, caring, and fairness in order to understand themselves and phases of ethical persuasion; they are:

#Explore the other person's viewpoint.
#Explain your viewpoint.
#Create resolutions.

The [[ethics]] of [[rhetoric]] is mainly concerned with [[morality]] and a persons ability to not be tempted in certain instances into helping themselves by negatively impacting others, or just as unethical to use [[persuasion]] to increase personal gain without the knowledge of the audience.

==Foundations for arguments==
According to Richard Weaver the main components of a [[Persuasion|persuasive]] argument stem from three different argument types.

:'''Genus''' - based around the “nature” of things and their general attributes

:'''Similtude''' -  concerns using associated ideas and principals

:'''Circumstance''' - includes neither one of these philosophies and does not concern individual values or beliefs, but rather necessity and immediate [[logic]].

FIT CTU is a member of Informatics Europe, the Association of European Faculties of Informatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatics-europe.org/membership/current-members.html|title=members|website=informatics-europe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
FIT CTU was established on the 1st of July, 2009 and its first academic year started on the 21st of September, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cesnet.cz/cesnet/reports/press-releases/linuxdays-in-4k-on-the-internet/?lang=en|title=LinuxDays in 4K on the Internet|website=cesnet.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by splitting of faculty of electrical engineering's computer department. About 500 student's were admitted to the first academic year of the institution. Of these 500 students, about 10% were women and about 20% were international students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praha.eu/jnp/cz/o_meste/zivot_v_praze/skolstvi/cvut_ma_osmou_fakultu_nazyvaji_ji_fit.html|title=New faculty|website=praha.eu|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic profile ==
Students in undergraduate and graduate study programme can choose from variety of majors from [[Computer Science]], [[Computer Security]], Web and [[Software engineering|Software Engineering]] to [[Data Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fit.cvut.cz/en/prospective-students/admission-info/bachelor-programme|title=bachelor programmes|website=fit.cvut.cz/en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fit.cvut.cz/en/prospective-students/admission-info/master-programme|title=master programmes|website=fit.cvut.cz/en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major can be selected throughout the study programme, but it needs to be selected before choosing bachelor's/master's thesis topic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1505">'''Giuseppe Ciccimarra''' (22 May 1790 &amp;ndash; 5 December 1836) was an Italian [[tenor]], closely associated with [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] roles.

==Career==
Ciccimarra was born in [[Altamura]]. He was considered one of the best [[comprimario]] tenors of his time.

For Rossini, he created, at the [[Teatro San Carlo]] in Naples, several roles including: Iago in ''[[Otello (Rossini)|Otello]]'', Goffredo in ''[[Armida (Rossini)|Armida]]'', Aronne in ''[[Mosè in Egitto]]'', Ernesto in ''[[Ricciardo e Zoraide]]'', Pilade in ''[[Ermione]]'', Condulmiero in ''[[Maometto II]]''.

He retired from the stage in 1826, and taught voice and piano in Vienna. Among his pupils were [[Josef Tichatschek]], creator of Wagner's ''[[Rienzi]]'' and ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'', the Austrian tenor [[Heinrich Kreutzer]] and [[Sophie Löwe]], one of the most famous opera singers of her time. He died in Venice.

'''Horace Mann''' (May 4, 1796{{snd}}August 2, 1859) was an American educational reformer and [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] politician dedicated to promoting public education. A central theme of his life was that "it is the law of our nature to desire happiness. This law is not local, but universal; not temporary, but eternal. It is not a law to be proved by exceptions, for it knows no exception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Horace |last=Mann |title=A Few Thoughts for a Young Man: A Lecture, Delivered Before the Boston Mercantile Library Association, on Its 29th Anniversary |year=1853 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the Massachusetts State legislature  (1827–1837). In 1848, after public service as Secretary of the [[Massachusetts State Board of Education]], Mann was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] (1848–1853). From September 1852 to his death, he served as President of [[Antioch College]].

About Mann's intellectual progressivism, the historian [[Ellwood P. Cubberley]] said:

{{quote|No one did more than he to establish in the minds of the American people the conception that education should be universal, non-sectarian, free, and that its aims should be social efficiency, civic virtue, and character, rather than mere learning or the advancement of education ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ellwood P. |last=Cubberley |title=Public Education in the United States |year=1919 |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Arguing that universal public education was the best way to turn unruly American children into disciplined, judicious [[Republicanism in the United States|republican]] citizens, Mann won widespread approval from modernizers, especially in the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], for building public schools. Most states adopted a version of the system Mann established in Massachusetts, especially the program for [[normal school]]s to train professional teachers.&lt;ref name="Mark Groen 1854, pp 251–260"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark |last=Groen |title=The Whig Party and the Rise of Common Schools, 1837–1854 |journal=American Educational History Journal |date=Spring–Summer 2008 |volume=35 |issue=1/2 |pages=251–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educational historians credit Horace Mann as father of the [[Common School]] Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas L. |last=Good |title=21st century education: a reference handbook |year=2008 |page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Education===
'''Horace Mann''' was born on May 4, 1796 in [[Franklin, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His father was a farmer without much money. From ten years of age to twenty, he had no more than six weeks' schooling during any year,&lt;ref name="Appleton"&gt;{{Cite Appletons|last=Tarbell |first=Isa Arlington |wstitle=Mann, Horace|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he made use of the  [[Franklin Public Library (Massachusetts)|Franklin Public Library]], the first public library in America. At the age of 20, he enrolled at [[Brown University]] and graduated in three years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McFarland |first=Philip |title=Hawthorne in Concord |location=New York |publisher=Grove Press |year=2004 |page=72 |isbn=0-8021-1776-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as valedictorian (1819). The theme of his oration was "The Progressive Character of the Human Race."&lt;ref name="Appleton"/&gt; He then studied law for a short time in [[Wrentham, Massachusetts]] and was a tutor of Latin and Greek (1820–1822) and a librarian (1821–1823) at Brown University. During 1822, he also studied at [[Litchfield Law School]] and, in 1823, was admitted to the bar in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Catalogue of the Litchfield Law School |location=Hartford, CT |publisher=Press of Case, Tiffany and Company |year=1849}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned Greek and Latin from [[Samuel Barrett (minister)]], who later became a famous Unitarian Minister.

===Massachusetts legislature===
Mann was elected to the legislature in 1827, and in that role was active in the interests of education, public charities, and laws for the suppression of intemperance and lotteries. He established the state lunatic asylum in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], and in 1833 was chairman of its board of trustees. Mann continued to be returned to the legislature as representative from Dedham until his removal to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in 1833. While in the legislature he was a member and part of the time chairman of the committee for the revision of the state statutes, and a large number of salutary provisions were incorporated into the code at his suggestion. After their enactment he was appointed one of the editors of the work, and prepared its marginal notes and its references to judicial decisions. He was elected to the [[Massachusetts State Senate]] from Boston in 1835, and was its president in 1836–1837.  As a member of the Senate, he spent time as the majority leader, and aimed his focus at infrastructure, funding the construction of railroads and canals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sarah |last=Mondale |title=School: The Story of American Public Education |location=New York |publisher=Beacon |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Horace-Mann|title=Horace Mann {{!}} American educator|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=May 1, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriages===
In 1830, Mann married Charlotte Messer, who was the daughter of the president of Brown University. She died two years later on August 1, 1832, and he never fully recovered from the intense grief and shock that accompanied her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McFarland |first=Philip |title=Hawthorne in Concord |location=New York |publisher=Grove Press |year=2004 |page=73 |isbn=0-8021-1776-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843, he married [[Mary Tyler Peabody Mann|Mary Tyler Peabody]].  Afterward, the couple accompanied [[Samuel Gridley Howe]] and [[Julia Ward Howe]] on a dual honeymoon to Europe. They then purchased a home in West Newton, MA at the corner of Chestnut and Highland Streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newtonma.gov/gov/historic/research/collections/papers/allen.asp|title=Allen Family Papers 1846-1915|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masshist.org/collection-guides/view/fa0234|title=Horace Mann Papers|last=|first=|date=|website=Massachusetts Historical Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horace and Mary had three sons:  [[Horace Mann Jr.]], George Combe Mann, and Benjamin Pickman Mann.

==Education reform==

It was not until he was appointed secretary in 1837 of the newly created [[board of education]] of Massachusetts (the first such position in the United States) that he began the work which was to place him in the foremost rank of American educators. Previously, he had not shown any special interest in education. He was encouraged to take the job only because it was a paid office position established by the legislature. He began as secretary of the board. On entering on his duties, he withdrew from all other professional or business engagements and from politics.

This led him to become the most prominent national spokesman for that position. He held this position, and worked with a remarkable intensity, holding teachers' conventions, delivering numerous lectures and addresses, carrying on an extensive correspondence, and introducing numerous reforms.

Mann traveled to every school in the state so he could physically examine each school ground.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} He planned and inaugurated the Massachusetts [[normal school]] system in [[Framingham State College|Lexington]] (which shortly thereafter moved to Framingham), [[Westfield State College|Barre]] (which shortly thereafter moved to Westfield) and [[Bridgewater State College|Bridgewater]], and began preparing a series of annual reports, which had a wide circulation and were considered as being "among the best expositions, if, indeed, they are not the very best ones, of the practical benefits of a common school education both to the individual and to the state".&lt;ref name="hinsdale"&gt;Hinsdale (1898).&lt;/ref&gt; By his advocacy of the disuse of corporal punishment in school discipline, he was involved in a controversy with some of the Boston teachers that resulted in the adoption of his views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&amp;psid=3535 |title=The Struggle for Public Schools |work=Digital History |last1=Mintz |first1=S. |last2=McNeil |first2=S. |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, he founded and edited ''The Common School Journal''. In this journal, Mann targeted the public school and its problems. His six main principles were: (1) the public should no longer remain ignorant; (2) that such education should be paid for, controlled, and sustained by an interested public; (3) that this education will be best provided in schools that embrace children from a variety of backgrounds; (4) that this education must be [[non-sectarian]]; (5) that this education must be taught using the tenets of a [[free society]]; and (6) that education should be provided by well-trained, professional teachers. Mann worked for more and better-equipped school houses, longer school years (until 16 years old), higher pay for teachers, and a wider curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biography.com/people/horace-mann-9397522&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the auspices of the board, but at his own expense, he went to Europe in 1843 to visit schools, especially in [[Prussia]], and his seventh annual report, published after his return, embodied the results of his tour. Many editions of this report were printed, not only in Massachusetts but in other states, in some cases by private individuals and in others by legislatures; several editions were issued in England. In 1852, he supported the decision to adopt the [[Prussian education system]] in Massachusetts. Shortly after Massachusetts adopted the Prussian system, the Governor of New York set up the same method in twelve different New York schools on a trial basis.

Mann hoped that by bringing all children of all classes together, they could have a common learning experience. This would also give an opportunity to the less fortunate to advance in the social scale and education would "equalize the conditions of men." Moreover, it was viewed also as a road to social advancement by the early labor movement and as a goal of having common schools. Mann also suggested that by having schools it would help those students who did not have appropriate discipline in the home. Building a person's character was just as important as reading, writing and arithmetic. Instilling values such as obedience to authority, promptness in attendance, and organizing the time according to bell ringing helped students prepare for future employment. Mann faced some resistance from parents who did not want to give up the moral education to teachers and bureaucrats. The normal schools trained mostly women, giving them new career opportunities as teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Linda |last=Eisenmann |title=Historical dictionary of women's education in the United States |year=1988 |page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practical result of Mann's work was a revolution in the approach used in the common school system of Massachusetts, which in turn influenced the direction of other states. In carrying out his work, Mann met with bitter opposition by some Boston schoolmasters who strongly disapproved of his innovative pedagogical ideas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Myra |last= Glenn |title= Campaigns Against Corporal Punishment |year= 1984 |isbn= 0-87395-813-6 |pages= 104–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by various religious sectarians, who contended against the exclusion of all sectarian instruction from the schools. Mann is often called  "the father of American public education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2007/07/04/no_children_need_apply/ |title=No children need apply |first=Steve |last=Baily |work=Boston Globe |date=July 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular nature===
As the ''Old Deluder Satan Act'' and other [[Massachusetts School Laws]] attest, early education even under state control in Massachusetts had a clear religious intent. However, by the time of Mann's leadership in education, various developments (including a vibrant populist Protestant faith and increased religious diversity) fostered a secular school system with a religiously passive stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Stephen V. |last1=Monsma |first2=J. Christopher |last2=Soper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LqtOyWU3D54C |title=The Challenge of Pluralism: Church and State in Five Democracies |chapter=2. The United States |pages=18–22|isbn=9780742557406 |date=September 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Mann affirmed that "our Public Schools are not Theological Seminaries" and that they were "debarred by law from inculcating the peculiar and distinctive doctrines of any one religious denomination amongst us ... or all that is essential to religion or to salvation," he assured those who objected to this secular nature that "our system earnestly inculcates all Christian morals; it founds its morals on the basis of religion; it welcomes the religion of the Bible; and, in receiving the Bible, it allows it to do what it is allowed to do in no other system—to speak for itself. But here it stops, not because it claims to have compassed all truth; but because it disclaims to act as an umpire between hostile religious opinions."

Mann stated that this position resulted in a near-universal use of the Bible in the schools of Massachusetts and that this served as an argument against the assertion by some that Christianity was excluded from his schools, or that they were anti-Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eURNAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=inculcates+all+Christian+morals;+it+founds+its+morals+on+the+basis+of+religion |last=Mann |first=Horace |title=Twelfth Annual Report for 1848 of the Secretary of the Board of Education of Massachusetts |pages=116, 177, 121, 122|year=1849 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mann also once stated that "it may not be easy theoretically, to draw the line between those views of religious truth and of Christian faith which is common to all, and may, therefore, with propriety be inculcated in schools, and those which, being peculiar to individual sects, are therefore by law excluded; still it is believed that no practical difficulty occurs in the conduct of our schools in this regard."

Rather than sanctioning a particular church as was often the norm in many states, the Legislature proscribed books "calculated to favor the tenets of any particular set of Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9S4XAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA14&amp;dq=may+not+be+easy+theoretically,+to+draw+the+line+between+those+views+of+religious+truth+and+of+Christian+faith+which+is+common+to+all,+and+may,+therefore,+with+propriety+be+inculcated+in+schools,+and+those+which,+being+peculiar+to+individual+sects,+are+therefore+by+law+excluded;+still+it+is+believed+that+no+practical+difficulty+occurs+in+the+conduct+of+our+schools+in+this+regard |author=Massachusetts Board of Education |title=Annual Report of the Board of Education |origyear=Covering the year 1837 |pages=14, 15|year=1838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. Congress==
In the spring of 1848 he was elected to the [[United States Congress]] as a [[Whig party (United States)|Whig]] to fill the vacancy caused by the death of [[John Quincy Adams]]. His first speech in that role was in advocacy of its right and duty to exclude [[slavery]] from the territories, and in a letter in December of that year he said: "I think the country is to experience serious times. Interference with slavery will excite civil commotion in the South. But it is best to interfere. Now is the time to see whether the Union is a rope of sand or a band of steel." Again he said: "I consider no evil as great as slavery, and I would pass the [[Wilmot Proviso]] whether the South rebel or not."{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} During the first session, he volunteered as counsel for [[Pearl incident|Drayton and Sayres]], who were indicted for stealing 76 slaves in the [[District of Columbia]], and at the trial was engaged for 21 successive days in their defense. In 1850, he was engaged in a controversy with [[Daniel Webster]] in regard to the extension of slavery and the [[Fugitive Slave Law]], calling Webster's support for the [[Compromise of 1850]] a "vile catastrophe", and comparing him to "Lucifer descending from Heaven".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Speech_Costs_Senator_His_Seat.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|title=Profiles in Courage| year=2004| pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mann was defeated by a single vote at the ensuing nominating convention by Webster's supporters; but, on appealing to the people as an independent anti-slavery candidate, he was re-elected, serving from April 1848 until March 1853.

==Leadership of Antioch College and last years==
[[File:HMann.jpg|left|thumb|Original daguerreotype of Rep. Mann (Mass.) from [[Mathew Brady]]'s studio, c. 1849.]]
In September 1852, he was nominated for [[governor of Massachusetts]] by the [[Free Soil Party]], and the same day was chosen president of the newly established [[Antioch College]] at [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]]. Failing in the election for governor, he accepted the presidency of the college, in which he continued until his death.  There he taught economics, philosophy, and theology; he was popular with students and with lay audiences across the Midwest who attended his lectures promoting public schools. Mann also employed the first woman faculty member to be paid on an equal basis with her male colleagues, [[Rebecca Pennell]], his niece. His commencement message to the class of 1859 was to "be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antiochcollege.edu/news/archive/antioch-college-announced-horace-mann-fellowship-first-class |title=Antioch College Announced the Horace Mann Fellowship for First Class |publisher=Antioch College |date=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antioch College was founded by the [[Christian Connexion]] which later withdrew its financial support causing the college to struggle for many years with meager financial resources due to sectarian infighting.  Mann himself was charged with nonadherence to sectarianism because, previously a Congregationalist by upbringing, he joined the [[American Unitarian Association|Unitarian Church]].

He collapsed shortly after the 1859 commencement and died that summer. Antioch historian Robert Straker wrote that Mann had been "crucified by crusading sectarians." [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] lamented "what seems the fatal waste of labor and life at Antioch." Mann's wife, who wrote in anguish that "the blood of martyrdom waters the spot," later disinterred his body from Yellow Springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Burton R. |title=The Distinctive College |publisher=Adline Publishing Co. |year=1970 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in the [[North Burial Ground]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|664}}&lt;/ref&gt; next to his first wife, Charlotte Messer Mann. (Charlotte Messer Mann was the daughter of Asa Messer, an early president of [[Brown University]].)

==Legacy==
Most historians treat Mann as the most important and beneficial leader of education reform in the antebellum period.

He has many places, including schools, around the world that are named after him.

Horace Mann's statue stands in front of the [[Massachusetts State House]] along with that of [[Daniel Webster]].

At Antioch College a monument carries his quote, which has been recently adopted as the college motto: "Be Ashamed to Die Until You Have Won Some Victory for Humanity."

The [[University of Northern Colorado]] named the gates to their campus in his dedication, a gift of the Class of 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unco.edu/library/archives/arc_photohist_BldgsandGrounds_Central_Campus.htm |title=University History: A Photographic History of UNC |publisher=University of Northern Colorado |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041207/http://www.unco.edu/library/archives/arc_photohist_BldgsandGrounds_Central_Campus.htm |archivedate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Springfield, Illinois]]-based Illinois Education Association Mutual Insurance Company, was renamed in honor of Mann in 1950 as the Horace Mann Educators Corporation.

In [[Massachusetts]], public charter schools that are authorized by local school districts are known as Horace Mann charters.

==Emulation of the Prussian education system in the United States==
American educators were fascinated by German educational trends. In 1818, [[John Griscom]] gave a favorable report of [[Prussian education system|Prussian education]].  Beginning in 1830, English translations were made of French philosopher [[Victor Cousin]]'s work, "Report on the State of Public Education in Prussia."  [[Calvin E. Stowe]], [[Henry Barnard]], Horace Mann, [[George Bancroft]] and [[Joseph Cogswell]] all had a vigorous interest in German education. In 1843, Mann traveled to Germany to investigate how the educational process worked. Upon his return to the United States, he lobbied heavily to have the "Prussian model" adopted.

Mann persuaded his fellow modernizers, especially those in the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], to legislate tax-supported elementary public education in their states. Indeed, most northern states adopted one version or another of the system he established in Massachusetts, especially the program for "[[normal schools]]" to train professional teachers.&lt;ref name="Mark Groen 1854, pp 251–260"/&gt; In 1852, Mann was instrumental in the decision to adopt an Prussian-style education system in Massachusetts.

The '''Illinois Loop''' is an organization of parents, teachers, school board members, and others working to restore academic substance and effective teaching methods into schools.

The Illinois Loop started informally in about 1995, when a group of parents and teachers in the west suburbs of [[Chicago]] shared their concerns and opinions about what they perceived as dangerous trends in reading and math instruction in their schools.  Using online message boards, and later the Internet, they shared news, tips and discoveries to better prepare for their efforts in their own schools.
	
Since then, the Illinois Loop has helped thousands of parents, teachers and school board members better understand the nature, the promise and the risks associated with promoted innovations in education.

Today, hundreds of people receive updates from the Illinois Loop's email news list. Participants include teachers, board members, nationally known education experts, and many parents.  While a principal focus is on education in [[Illinois]], much of the group's activities and information is applicable throughout the United States.

Areas of particular concern to the Illinois Loop include expansion of [[whole language]] to the detriment of reading skills, adoption by schools of so-called [[fuzzy mathematics|fuzzy math]] programs instead of [[traditional mathematics | mastery-based math programs]], reduction of the role of the teacher as an instructor, and overall lessening of substance and factual content in courses such as history, literature, geography, [[grammar]] and [[science education | science]].

==Issues==

Some supporters of constructivist approaches in education accuse the Illinois Loop of being a "conservative political organization".  The group is highly apolitical, does not get involved in political issues, and has leaders and members who are Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives and libertarians. 

Other criticisms:  "Illinois Loop does not support the concept of differentiation" (wrong, it does), "or changing instruction methods to support the learning style of particular students" (also wrong, since the Illinois Loop is highly supportive of finding the best environment for individual children).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1646">The '''Indian National Chemistry Olympiad''' ('''INChO''' for short) is an [[Olympiad]] in [[Chemistry]] held in [[India]].

The theory part of the INChO examination is held in end-January/beginning February of every year. It is conducted by the [[Indian Association of Chemistry Teachers]]. School students (usually of standards 11, 12) first need to qualify the [[National Standard Examination in Chemistry]] (NSEC) held in November of the preceding year. Among the 30,000+ students who sit for the NSEC, only the top 1% are selected for the INChO.

About 35 students are selected from the written examination. A total of 30 students are selected from these to attend the Orientation-Cum-Selection-Camp (OCSC), chemistry, held at [[HBCSE]], Mumbai.

Most of the students qualifying the INChO are those completing their twelfth standard. However, there have been some cases of students qualifying INChO at the end of eleventh, or tenth standard itself.

== OCSC Chemistry ==
The Orientation-Cum-Selection-Camp (OCSC), Chemistry consists of rigorous training and testing in theory and experiment. The top four performers here are selected to represent India in the [[International Chemistry Olympiad]]. Before IChO, the selected team undergoes rigorous training in theory and experiment, in a Pre-Departure Training Camp, held in HBCSE.

==Biography==
Breeden was born on 9 May 1872 to Fredrick Breeden and Jane Breeden at St. Saviour in [[Surrey]], England. He spent his [[adolescence]] with his family at [[Newington, London]] and finished his primary education at St John’s, [[Inner London]]. Having been influenced by the teachings of [[John Wesley]], founder of [[Methodism|Methodist Movement]], from his early life, he joined [[City College, Birmingham|Handsworth College, Birmingham]] and studied for [[ordination]] as a [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyan Methodist Minister]]. While studying at Handsworth College, he met James Cooling, who was on [[sabbatical]] leave from [[Madras]] and was a speaker on the [[Methodist Circuit]]; James remained as a mentor of Breeden till his death in [[Madras]] in 1915.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;

In 1888, he entered the ministry and learnt the [[Tamil language]] in London under the guidance of [[missionaries]] who had served in [[India]]. Having volunteered for service as a missionary in Madras Presidency with Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society (WMMS), he sailed to India on 30 September 1898. Upon arrival in Madras, he served as a minister in the Wesley Church at [[Black Town]], also known as [[George Town, Chennai]] where he preached the [[sermon]] ''The Unpardonable Sin''. In 1899, he worked as [[probation]]er with the Foreign Missions, active with recording and officiating at Births, Deaths and Marriages at Wesleyan Methodist Church in [[Perambur]]. In 1901, he married Frances Cox and served in Madras in the English colonies of the WMMS, referred to as the [[Methodist Circuit|Madras English circuit]], between 1898 and 1911. During this time, he was involved in raising money to build a new church at [[Egmore]] called the Egmore Church, the present [[Wesley Church, Chennai]]; for this, he visited the homes of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] and Eurasian families (or Anglo-Indian), [[British Raj]] [[government]] servants, and visitors to Madras-both Christian and non-Christians alike. Egmore Church was formally inaugurated on 11 February 1905 by James Cooling, his mentor; Breeden was appointed as its first minister by Cooling.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;

During his [[furlough]] in England, he served as missionary lecturer at Richmond Theological College in 1907. After he returned from England to Madras, Breeden devoted most of his time to the cause of education of [[orphans]] of European, [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]], or [[Anglo-Indians]] origin, between 1911 and 1915 as his ministry was the English circuit in Madras, which meant that his flock were the families of British Raj soldiers, [[civil servants]], and Eurasian population; during this time, he founded St. George's Homes an Orphanage, initially at [[Kodaikanal]] and later moved to [[Ketti]] in [[Nilgiri mountains|Nilgiris]]—St. George's Homes was subsequently named as Laidlaw Memorial School &lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R4"/&gt;

He returned to England in 1921 due to ill-health after missionary service of twenty-three years. In 1937, he published ''He Suffered There'', an [[ecumenical]] book. During [[World War II]], he continued to work from St. Stephens House in [[Westminster]] which was used to provide relief for those displaced by the bombing of London. At the age of 70, he died in the district of [[Meriden, West Midlands|Meriden]] in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;

==St. George's Homes==
Being a minister in the English circuit of the Wesleyan Mission in Madras, he was more associated and observant of the ostracised and neglected members of the Anglo-Indian community — during those times, European schools in colonial British Raj catered to pure and mixed-race Europeans who retained "European habits or modes of life". Anglo-Indians were not accepted in better schools, and indigenous [[Indian people|Indians]] were entirely prohibited - British parents often objected to their children rubbing shoulders with mixed-race students; accordingly, he made their education and accommodation as the central-point of his missionary work in Madras. In 1910, J. Breeden first thought of establishing a home for orphans and destitute children of the Anglo-Indian community, also known as Eurasians — unwanted children of illicit and mixed relationships born out of wedlock - these offspring were of unofficial unions of Europeans (mostly English, Americans and Europeans) on the payroll of the
[[East India Company|British East India Company]] like soldiers and civil servants with Asians or local Indians - these children, usually had no identification with their country of birth — A study conducted in 1879 found that except pure European descent, most of the Anglo-Indians in [[Bengal]], especially Anglo-Indians living in the slums of [[Calcutta]] and Madras received no formal education.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mm"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kennedy |first= Dane Keith  |title= The Magic Mountains: Hill Stations and the British Raj |publisher= University of California Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UveLzKDlZBEC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=St.+George%E2%80%99s+Homes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IarUT-7QIoarrAe-0vz7Dw&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=St.%20George%E2%80%99s%20Homes&amp;f=false|year= 1996 |pages= 140- |isbn= 978-0-520-20188-0|id= {{ISBN|0-520-20188-4}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1910, he addressed the Madras Missionary Conference where he made his first appeal for the establishment of St. George's Homes evincing the plight of poor and deprived children. In the conference, he proposed the neglected Eurasians be given an opportunity to emerge from a tangled growth with their European and Indian origins overcoming the neglect and prejudice from both British Raj government policy and European population. He advocated for the support following the model of [[Dr. Graham's Homes|St. Andrew's Colonial Homes]](later renamed to [[Dr. Graham's Homes]]), an Orphanage-cum-School, established at [[Kalimpong]] by [[John Anderson Graham]], a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] missionary. He put forth before the committee that the Anglo-Indian community cannot sustain purely on alms alone, but pleaded for government support too; consequently, a committee was constituted with Breedon as its secretary and his mentor James Cooling as its chairman — James Cooling at that time was the chairman of WMMS Madras district and also the Principal of "[http://www.wesleyschool.in/headmasters.html Wesley High School]" in [[Royapettah]]. His thoughts on the subject were published in ''Harvest Field'' later in November 1910. As the WMMS role was to oversee only missionary problems and spread fellowship among the various societies, the body stated that it had no power to initiate new work when the committee's resolution was submitted to WMMS; consequently, the missionary conference decided to form a separate organization to work for the realization of its resolution. Hence, St. George's Homes society formed in 1910, had in fact became the foundation of the establishment of the Homes with sincere efforts from John Breeden. For the first committee, then Governor of Madras [[Arthur Lawley, 6th Baron Wenlock|Arthur Lawley]] consented to be the President of the Homes with a promise to grant 1000 acres of land in [[Kodaikanal]].&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hind"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hindu.com/mp/2010/03/01/stories/2010030151000600.htm |title= Persistence pays|date= 1 March 2010 |quote= St. George's Homes, which opened its doors in May 1914 after planning and fund-raising efforts that John Breeden had started in 1910, is now called the Laidlaw Memorial School and Junior College |publisher= hindu.com|accessdate= 10 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sm"&gt;{{cite book |last= Mizutani |first= Satoshi |title= The Meaning of White: Race, Class, and the 'Domiciled Community' in British India 1858-1930 |publisher= Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Mt78VcAhfIC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=St.+George%E2%80%99s+Homes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3MXUT7CULI7jrAfE0YD9Dw&amp;ved=0CGoQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=St.%20George%E2%80%99s%20Homes&amp;f=false |year= 2012 |pages= 144- |isbn= 978-0-19-969770-0|id= {{ISBN|0-19-969770-1}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, John Anderson Graham visited Madras and spoke about his work in Kalimpong homes influencing many, including Arthur Lawley, the then Governor of Madras and also the President of the committee. St. George’s Homes to be constructed later in Kodaikanal had the same purpose as that of the Kalimpong homes. The committee at its first meeting decided to establish an institution for European and Eurasian orphans in Kodaikanal on the lines of Dr. Graham's Homes in Kalimpong. During this meeting, it was decided to send John Breeden to work in Great Britain soliciting funds for "European and Eurasian Education Fund" to raise necessary funds for St. George's Homes. As part of collecting funds for St. George's Homes and other  educational institutions for Anglo-Indians, "European and Eurasian Education Fund" was formed with its own National Council, in January 1911. The aim of this is to send a delegation to England and solicit the funds on name of orphans.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sm"/&gt;

In April 1911, a delegation of the All India Central Committee led by W.H. Arden-Wood,  Principal of [[La Martiniere, Calcutta]] and a Fellow of [[Calcutta University]], representing all the Christian communities of the British Raj except Roman Catholics went to England to portray the plight of domiciled Anglo-Indian communities with respect to their education and collect funds. John Breeden was one among the five delegates who visited England.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hind"/&gt;

In May 1911, as part of fundraising efforts through donations for "European and Eurasian Education Fund" with Breeden as its Organising secretary, they published their appeals in major journals like [[The Times]] (in London). Breeden, who was prominent in advocacy for the collection of funds wrote an appeal in ''The Child'', a monthly [[Magazine|journal]] devoted to Child 
welfare, in October 1912 as:{{cquote|the domiciled British and Anglo-Indian community in India – numbering 250,000 to 300,000 – has been steadily declining in the social scale. In some of the cities of India 50 percent of these people are living below the pauper line. Lord Lansdowne says that this condition of affairs is a national reproach, which ought to have been removed years ago; Lord Roberts describes the problem as ‘one of the most painful in any part of the Empire.’ The question of adult pauperism in India is too big a problem to come within the scope of the present movement. But all authorities on India agree that the best solution is to be founding concentrating on the children of school-going age.....&lt;BR/&gt;....there are 44,000 Anglo-Indian children and about 10,000 of these children are receiving no education whatsoever… we are asking for justice not charity for these neglected little ones…..if these children were in Great Britain their birthright would ensure compulsory and free education.’ Rev Breeden then adds clarification in his appeal writing that....&lt;BR/&gt;....missionary societies cannot, without a breach of trust, use money for Europeans when it has been donated for evangelization of non-Christian peoples. Hence the need for this special fund… and donations can be sent to Sir Capel Wolseley, Bart, 55 Market Street (Room 7), Manchester’.....&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;}}

The fund raising delegation and the All Indian Central Committee in which John Breeden was a member, was recognized by [[Buckingham Palace]] and the work of fund raising efforts continued till December 1913. In 1913, Breeden along with  Capel Wolseley established  Lancashire Committee to solicit funds in the mid counties of the [[United Kingdom]]. Breeden finally reverted to Madras in 1913 and started his preparation for the establishment of St. George's Homes. Breeden succeeded in raising nearly 7,000 [[Pound sterling|British pounds]] for initial buildings for the Homes. By February 1914, 10,000 British pounds was raised.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hind"/&gt;

St. George's Homes was registered under ''Act XXI of 1860'' in February 1914. British Raj government reserved 600 acres of land for the Homes in Pulney Hills, Kodaikanal. [[John Sinclair, 1st Baron Pentland|John Sinclair]], then-[[Governor of Madras]], as the first President of the St. George's Homes turned the first sod on the site for Homes on 17[18] February  1914. Homes first Vice-president was [[bishop]] of Madras, and John Breeden was appointed as its first Secretary and the Principal of St. George's Homes. [[Harold Stuart]], a Civil servant, was elected as the first chairman of the board of Homes. In May 1914, first two orphan children were admitted in a rented cottage triggering the start of the activities of the new school for Homes. In November 1914, additional cottages were rented out for accommodation of girls and babies. On 25 November 1914, first school teacher from England joined the Homes. In its first year of inception, the school grew to twenty-one boys and twelve girls, including seven babies. In 1922, St. George's Homes was moved from Kodaikanal to [[Ketti]] of [[Nilgiris district]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], after John Breeden left to England in 1921 due to ill-health that forced him to retire.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hind"/&gt;

===Criticism===
G. F. Paddison, then-[[District Collector|Collector]] of Madras, speaking on the occasion of first year of St. George's Homes described John Breeden as a "great beggar." He also said, as reported in Madras Mail on 8 June 1915:{{cquote|...we have had experience with such ‘beggars’ in the past, and we have come to recognise that their secret of success has in all cases been the same – an unbound faith in the cause they espouse. Unwearying patience, unquenchable importunity, and a gift for advertising that would put a Yankee patent medicine ‘drummer’ to shame.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;}}
He compared the work of John Breeden on behalf of St. George's Homes and the "European Education Fund" as qualifying him to be recognized as "the best beggar in the Madras Presidency." Adding further, he also said "...&amp;nbsp;Mendicancy of this nature is a holy gift applied to holy cause&amp;nbsp;... will see St Georges Homes expand and succeed&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;

'''Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi''' (28 October 1764 – 26 September 1852) was an Italian [[archdeacon]], [[scientist]], [[mathematician]], [[political economist]].&lt;ref name="Patriarca 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Patriarca |first=S. |title=Numbers and Nationhood: Writing Statistics in Nineteenth-Century Italy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |series=Cambridge Studies in Italian H |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-52260-1 |url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=wolc03t9QdoC&amp;pg=PA27 |access-date=7 October 2018 |pages=27-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a few books about [[pedagogy]] and he invented the [[tonograph]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#tonografia1841|Tonografia escogitata (1841)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
[[File:Tonograph - Device invented by Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi (1764-1852).jpg|thumb|left|[[Tonograph]] invented by Cagnazzi]]
He taught [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] in the ancient [[University of Altamura]] under the rectorship of Msgr. [[Gioacchino de Gemmis]]. In 1799 he first moved to [[Florence]] where he worked as a teacher and then he moved to the [[University of Naples Federico II]] where he became a professor of statistics and of economics, and a member of the [[Royal Society of Encouragement to Natural Sciences of Naples]].

He also became head of the Office of Statistics and Trade of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], under [[Joachim Murat]]'s rule, and he kept that position until 1821. He was a frequent contributor to ''{{ill|Il progresso delle scienze, delle lettere e delle arti|it}}'', of which he was also editor for a short time. In 1848, at age of 84, he was elected member of the newly born Parliament of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]; he was involved in the riots of Naples on 15 May 1848 and, because of this, he ended up under trial in Naples. He died in 1852, aged 88, during a trial session.

'''Martin Petzold''' (born 1955) is a German classical [[tenor]] who performs in opera and in concert. A former member of the [[Thomanerchor]], he is particularly known for the part of the [[Evangelist (Bach)|Evangelist]] in oratorios and [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].

== Career ==

Petzold was born in [[Leipzig]], the son of the theologian [[Ernst Petzold]]. He received his first musical education as a member of the [[Thomanerchor]],&lt;ref name="bc" /&gt; where he was a member from 1965 to 1974, at the same time as [[Georg Christoph Biller]]. His father, his brother and later his son Jakob were also choir members.

As Petzold initially refused to join the [[National People's Army|army]], the [[East Germany|East German]] authorities denied him the right to study music. He served for 18 months and then studied voice from 1979 to 1985 at the [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig]] with Eva Schubert and Bernd Siegfried Weber.&lt;ref name="bc" /&gt; He wanted to sing in an opera chorus, but while still a student was engaged as a soloist in [[Halberstadt]] and [[Altenburg]]. In 1985 he became a member of the [[Landestheater Halle]].&lt;ref name="bc" /&gt; He appeared regularly at the [[Leipzig Opera]] from 1986, and has been a permanent member of the ensemble since 1988. He has sung the parts of David in Wagner's ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'', Pedrillo in Mozart's ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'', Toni in Henze's ''[[Elegie für junge Liebende]]'', Flaut in ''Ein Sommernachtstraum'' and Iwan in Shostakovich's ''[[Die Nase (opera)|Die Nase]]'', among others.&lt;ref name="bc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="trio" /&gt;

In concert, Petzold has collaborated with major orchestras and choirs, such as the Thomanerchor, the [[Dresdner Kreuzchor]], the [[Monteverdi-Chor Hamburg]], the [[Gewandhausorchester]], the [[MDR Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Freiburg Baroque Orchestra]].&lt;ref name="bc" /&gt; A particular focus of his work is works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]; he has sung the part of the [[Evangelist (Bach)|Evangelist]] in his ''[[Christmas Oratorio]]'' and ''[[Passions (Bach)|Passions]]'', conducted by Biller, [[Peter Schreier]], [[Kurt Masur]], [[Roderich Kreile]], [[Rolf Schweizer]] and [[David Timm]].&lt;ref name="bc" /&gt; Petzold also works for the preservation of German folk songs.

In teaching, Martin Petzold has worked since 2002 as a lecturer at international master classes&lt;ref name="bc" /&gt; and is also a vocal coach of the Thomanerchor. In 2001, Martin Petzold was appointed [[Kammersänger]].&lt;ref name="trio" /&gt; &lt;!-- In addition, he is making an increasing name for himself as an illustrator and cartoonist. --&gt;

'''Mësonjëtorja''' or '''The Albanian School''' was the first secular school in the [[Albanian language]] within [[Ottoman Albania]].&lt;ref name="Sultana26"/&gt; It was opened in [[Korçë]] during the late Ottoman period.&lt;ref name=Palairet115/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sultana26"/&gt; The school building serves as a museum&lt;ref name=Palairet115/&gt; and is located on the north side of ''Bulevardi Shën Gjergji'' (St. George Boulevard).

The opening of the school was a result of the [[Albanian National Awakening|Albanian National Movement]] which aimed to create an independent Albania and to secure denied rights to [[Albanian people]] within the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Among others Mësonjëtorja was an important center of cultural and patriotic education. The school's importance was raised because until then giving lessons in the Albanian language was done in private and secret due to Ottoman rule. The school opened its doors on 7 March 1887 and since then the day is celebrated by Albanians as the "Day of Teachers". 

== History ==
[[File:Mesonjetorja1899.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Pupils of the "Mësonjëtorja" in 1899]] 
In 1885, [[Naim Frashëri]], a government civil servant in the education ministry, [[Sami Frashëri]] and along with other influential Albanians involved in the [[Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings]] managed to get permission from the sultan for the opening of a private Albanian boys elementary school in [[Korçë]].&lt;ref name="Skendi134"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych88"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ozdalga264265/&gt; Financial support for the school came from a diaspora organisation [[Drita (magazine)|Drita]] ({{lang-en|the Light}}), an Albanian society based in [[Bucharest]], while Albanians from Istanbul got [[Pandeli Sotiri]] to become its first school director.&lt;ref name="Skendi134"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clayer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clayer|first=Natalie|title=Aux origines du nationalisme albanais: la naissance d'une nation majoritairement musulmane en Europe|publisher=KARTHALA Editions|year=2007|pages=301–10|isbn=2-84586-816-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=umotBF3KFWgC&amp;pg=PA301|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Society for Albanian Writings and Drita had agreed in past times not to antagonize town notables who were under Greek cultural influence by founding Albanian schools.&lt;ref name="Skendi134"/&gt; As such Drita sent one of its members [[Thimi Marko]], a town native on a mission to discuss the matter and he met with the Orthodox Metropolitan and his council (demogerontia) in Korçë.&lt;ref name="Skendi134"/&gt; The [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople Patriarchate]] refused have Albanian taught within existing Greek schools belonging to the Korçë Orthodox community.&lt;ref name="Skendi134"/&gt; Pandeli Sotiri was sent to Korçë and opened the school on 7 March 1887.&lt;ref name="Skendi134"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=134.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sultana26"&gt;{{harvnb|Sultana|2002|p=26.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych88"/&gt; Due to a lack of education material Sami, his brother [[Naim Frashëri]] and several other Albanians wrote textbooks in the Albanian language for the school.&lt;ref name="Gawrych88"/&gt; During 1887, Pandeli Sotiri had to leave Korçë and administration of the school passed to [[Petro Nini Luarasi]], a revolutionary and [[Thanas Sina]].&lt;ref name="Skendi135"/&gt; The Ottoman authorities gave permission only for Christian children to be educated in Albanian, but the Albanians did not follow this restriction and allowed Muslim children to attend.&lt;ref name=Ozdalga264265/&gt; In the first few years, the school overall had some two hundred enrolled students of Muslim and Christian faiths.&lt;ref name="Gawrych88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi134135"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|pp=134-135.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1888, the elementary school had 100 Christian and 60 Muslim students.&lt;ref name="Gawrych88"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=88.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Korça Mësonjtorja.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The Mësonjëtorja in Korçë]]
Local pressure against parents sending their children to the school grew.&lt;ref name="Gawrych89"/&gt; The Constantinople Patriarchate was opposed the school's establishment and along with mainly Greek clerics both were concerned that the development of a national consciousness among Orthodox Albanians could lead to the creation of an Orthodox Albanian church.&lt;ref name="Gawrych89"/&gt; As such from its founding the metropolitan and Orthodox notables intensified attacks against the school, while the school was denounced as subversive to Orthodox unity by local Greek priests.&lt;ref name="Skendi135"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych89"/&gt; The Orthodox church threatened excommunication and forced parents to remove their children from attending the school resulting in a drastic drop of student numbers.&lt;ref name="Skendi135"/&gt; During the same time Muslims were discouraged from enrollment and forced by the local Ottoman administration to withdraw attending the school as they feared that an Albanian national renaissance might eventuate in revolutionary activity.&lt;ref name="Skendi135"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych89"/&gt; Over time due to pressure coming from both sides school enrollment went down to eighty students.&lt;ref name="Gawrych89"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=89.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the school's existence, the organisation Drita (later renamed as Dituria) and the Albanian Society of Istanbul viewed as one of their aims being to support the elementary school in Korçë.&lt;ref name="Skendi146147"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|pp=146-147.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial difficulties however plagued the school as Albanians could not raise the needed funds to support it.&lt;ref name="Skendi135"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=135.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pro-Patriarchate party in Korçë falsely accused Albanians involved with the school of raising funds for [[Komitadji|Komita]] guerilla bands against Ottoman rule.&lt;ref name="Skendi136"/&gt; Support came from the people and school managed to survive for fifteen years.&lt;ref name="Sultana27"/&gt; Nuçi Naçi, had become the new director of the school and had managed to get support from the Turkish governor general based in Monastir (modern [[Bitola]]).&lt;ref name="Skendi136"/&gt; A translated version of Sami's play [[Sami Frashëri#The Besa yahut Ahde Vefa play|''Besa yahut Ahde Vefa'']] (Pledge of Honour or Loyalty to an Oath) in Albanian celebrating an Albanian identity also became part of the school curriculum in 1901.&lt;ref name="Gawrych148"/&gt; After a visit (1902) to Bucharest, [[Idhomene Kosturi]] told Albanians in Korçë that the main concern of Dituria was to improve the boys school through student attainment of higher grades, selecting better teachers and introducing new subjects.&lt;ref name="Skendi146147"/&gt; The mistrust of Christians by the sultan increased who thought that Albanian education could contribute to the concept of Albanian unity and nationality open to exploitation by foreign interests.&lt;ref name="Skendi136"/&gt; [[Abdul Hamid II]] ordered the school closed down in 1902.&lt;ref name="Gawrych148"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gawrych|first=George|title=The Crescent and the Eagle: Ottoman rule, Islam and the Albanians, 1874–1913|year=2006|location=London|publisher=IB Tauris|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wPOtzk-unJgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+crescent+and+the+eagle:+Ottoman+rule,+Islam+and+the+Albanians,+1874-1913+lexicon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT94zl8ebXAhWJT7wKHYRLADEQ6AEIJjAA#v=snippet&amp;q=Then%20in%201886&amp;f=false|isbn=9781845112875|pages=148.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehmed Ali Pasha Delvina, the new Ottoman governor of Korçë supported the empire, was against Albanian nationalism and in 1902 Nuçi Naçi was arrested and incarcerated in Salonica.&lt;ref name="Skendi136"/&gt; The school had survived until 1902 under the teachers Leonidis and Naum Naça who were arrested and declared as traitors by Ottoman authorities at the request of Greek clergy with the school being closed down, vandalised and wrecked.

It is, however, the first Albanian school to be founded, and the building in Korçë (or a facsimile thereof) is preserved as a museum. It survived till 1902, under teachers Naum and Leonidas Natcha, but they were incarcerated as traitors (to the Ottoman state) at the behest of the Greek clergy, and their school was wrecked and vandalized.

[[File:OliveRush1912.png|thumb|Olive Rush, from a 1912 publication.]]
'''Olive Rush''' (June 10, 1873 near [[Fairmount, Indiana]] – August 20, 1966 in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]) was an illustrator, muralist, and an important pioneer in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[art education]].

Today her paintings are held in a number of private collections and museums, including the [[Haan Mansion Museum of Indiana Art]].

==Education==
Raised as a [[Society of Friends|Quaker]], Olive Rush studied at [[Earlham College]], the art school associated with the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] and at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] before becoming an illustrator in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abatemarco|first=Michael|title=A Hoosier in Santa Fe: Artist Olive Rush|work=McClatchy-Tribune Business News|publisher=Tribune Content Agency LLC|date=December 5, 2015|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1630391659|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was well known for her portraits and paintings of children and women, many of  which were featured in magazines such as ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'' and ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine|St. Nicholas]]''. In 1904 she moved to [[Wilmington, Delaware]], to study with [[Howard Pyle]], and she stayed until 1910.  She spent the next year in Europe studying British and French painters, and finished her art education at the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Boston Museum School]] in 1912. In 1913 Rush returned to Europe with her friend, the watercolorist [[Alice Schille]], visiting Belgium and France.

==Career==
In 1914 Rush, with her father, visited [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]], and she had a one-person exhibition at the [[Palace of the Governors]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. She made several visits to New Mexico over the next couple of years and moved permanently to Santa Fe in 1920. Despite the relative isolation of Santa Fe, Rush continued to contribute to national and international shows over the next thirty years, which activity culminated in a retrospective at the [[New Mexico Museum of Art|Museum of New Mexico Art Gallery]] in 1957.

Her former studio on Canyon Road in Santa Fe is now the home to the Santa Fe Quaker Meeting, as well as having guest house facilities available on the site.

Rush considered her major influences to be early Chinese art, Japanese art, and [[El Greco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rush|first=Olive|title=Olive Rush Paintings|year=1957|publisher=Museum of New Mexico Art Gallery|location=Santa Fe}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also inspired by the colorful style of [[Hopi]] and other Puebloan artists of the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Booker|first=Margaret M.|title=Hopi|work=Grove Art Online|publisher=University Oxford Press|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T038894|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murals==
Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the [[United States]] through the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]], later called the [[Section of Fine Arts]], of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]]. The murals were intended to boost the morale of the American people from the effects of [[Great Depression in the United States|the Depression]] by depicting uplifting subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/arts_and_architecture/2805/post_office_murals/432816 Rediscovering the People's Art: New Deal Murals in Pennsylvania’s Post Offices]". Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission: 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 850 artists were commissioned to paint 1371 murals, most of which were installed in post offices, libraries, and other public buildings.&lt;ref name="ark"&gt;University of Central Arkansas. "[http://uca.edu/postofficemurals/home/ Arkansas Post Office Murals]".&lt;/ref&gt; 162 of the artists were women. The murals were funded as a part of the cost of the construction with 1% of the cost set aside for artistic enhancements.&lt;ref name= "ark" /&gt;

Olive Rush was commissioned by the Section of Fine Arts to complete painted murals for several public buildings in the American West. In Santa Fe, New Mexico she completed ''The Library Reaches the People'', a fresco at the public library (now part of the [[New Mexico History Museum]]), as well as at the hotel [[La Fonda on the Plaza|La Fonda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Broder|first1=Patricia|title=The American West : the modern vision|date=1984|publisher=Little, Brown, and Company|location=Boston|isbn=0821215787|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Pawhuska, Oklahoma]] she completed an oil on canvas mural, ''Osage Treaties'' for the  post office.  In [[Florence, Colorado]] she painted ''Antelope'' for the post office. Lastly, she completed two frescos, ''Cotton Industry and Farming'' and ''Natural History of Plant and Animal Life'' for the Foster Hall Biology Building at [[New Mexico State University]]. Also, her mural for the Maisel's Trading Post on Central in Albuquerque is still in place. She taught mural painting to students at the Santa Fe Indian School, which is now the [[Institute of American Indian Arts]].

'''Peter Rose''', is an [[architect]] and educator from [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada. He is the principal of Peter Rose + Partners, an architectural practice based in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].

Rose's best-known work in Canada is the [[Canadian Centre for Architecture]] (CCA), which was designed by Rose with CCA founder [[Phyllis Lambert]] as consulting architect and [[Erol Argun]] as associate architect.&lt;ref name="Wagg1"&gt;{{cite book|last=WAGG|first=SUSAN|title=Canadian Centre for Architecture/Centre Canadien d'Architecture|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/canadian-centre-for-architecturecentre-canadien-darchitecture/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completed in 1989, the CCA received the [[Honor Awards for Architecture|Honor Award for Architecture]] from the [[American Institute of Architects]] and the [[Governor General's Awards#Governor General's Medals in Architecture|Governor General's Medals in Architecture]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="Wagg2"&gt;{{cite book|last=WAGG|first=SUSAN|title=Rose, Peter Douglas|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/peter-douglas-rose/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose founded the Alcan Lectures in Architecture, which ran from 1974 to 1992. This lecture series sponsored by [[Alcan Aluminium Limited]] brought architects, architectural historians and planners to the city. Rose's association with Alcan also included interior planning and design with [[Peter Lanken]] on the company's world headquarters [[Maison Alcan]] on [[Sherbrooke Street]], which preserved a row of historic buildings in city's [[Golden Square Mile]] district.&lt;ref name="Wagg2"/&gt;

In collaboration with [[Aurèle Cardinal]], Rose designed the plans for the redevelopment of the [[Old Port of Montreal]] in the early 90s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

After studying architecture at [[Yale University]], where he worked under [[Vincent Scully]] and [[Charles Willard Moore|Charles Moore]], Rose returned to Montreal, designing [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodern]] [[vacation house]]s in the [[Eastern Townships]] and [[Laurentides|Laurentian]] regions. He is noted for his residential designs for homes in western [[New England]], including several vacation cottages in northern Vermont and individual houses in [[Sharon, Connecticut]] and [[Stowe, Vermont]]. His design for the house in Stowe was selected as one of ''[[Architectural Record]]'''s Record Houses in 1998. The ''[[New York Times]]'' featured his renovation of a [[townhouse]] for [[Edgar Bronfman, Jr.]] in [[Manhattan]] in September 1999.&lt;ref name="Wagg2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Morgan, [http://www.projo.com/opinion/contributors/content/CT_morgan2_02-02-10_FVH9FOK_v16.3f8daa3.html The unaccidental Rose bends annex at Kripalu Yoga], ''The Providence Journal'', February 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, construction was completed on Rose's design for a dormitory at the [[Kripalu Center|Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health]] in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Campbell (journalist)|Robert Campbell]], [http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2010/05/09/new_dorm_at_kripalu_center_radiates_sustainability_and_simplicity/ Kripalu center dorm radiates simple sustainability], ''The Boston Globe'', May 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose is adjunct professor of Architecture at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] and has taught at [[Princeton University]], [[McGill University]] and the [[University of Toronto]]. He is the author of ''Peter Rose: Houses'', published by [[Princeton Architectural Press]].&lt;ref name="papress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papress.com/html/book.details.page.tpl?isbn=9781568988214|title=Peter Rose: Houses |work=[[Princeton Architectural Press]]|accessdate=6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6601">A '''pracademic''' is someone who is both an [[academic]] and an active practitioner in their subject area. 

The term has a history of at least 30 years, but its first coining is unclear. The earliest reference may have been identified by a subscriber to Worldwide Words&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/backissues/wbi080830.txt Worldwide Words] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720080943/http://www.worldwidewords.org/backissues/wbi080830.txt |date=July 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as being 1973. 

In his 2001 Article 'The Life and Times of Pracademics', Paul L Posner &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxwell.syr.edu/pa/minnowbrook3/PDF%20Files/Phase%20II%20Papers/Posner%20-%20The%20Pracademic.pdf Article] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the term pracademic. Since Posner's article many academics have used the term in journals and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpa.niu.edu/pub_ad/publications/pracademic.shtml |accessdate=February 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828061229/http://www.mpa.niu.edu/pub_ad/publications/pracademic.shtml |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 Maria R Volpe and David Chandler in their paper in Negotiation Journal &lt;ref&gt;Maria R Volpe and David Chandler, Resolving and Managing conflicts in Academic Communities: The Emerging Role of the "Pracademic", Negotiation Journal, Vol 17 Iss 3, P245-255, 2001, Wiley InterScience&lt;/ref&gt; describe the bridging role as that of the 'Pracademic'. Again in 2001 Willard T. Price uses the term in the same context of academic and practicing professional in Public Works.&lt;ref&gt;Willard T. Price, A Pracademic Research Agenda for Public Infrastructure, Public Works Management &amp; Policy, Vol. 5, No. 4, 287-296 (2001), Sage&lt;/ref&gt; George L Hanbury builds on the term in his paper on the ethics of honor by describing himself as a Pracademic and observing his subject from this stand point.&lt;ref&gt;George L. Hanbury, A “Pracademic’s” Perspective of Ethics and Honor: Imperatives for Public Service in the 21st Century!, Public Organization Review, Volume 4, Number 3, September 2004 , pp. 187-204, Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the core bridging concept appears to be the main theme several other usages have emerged. The idea of the Pracademic being a type of teaching style for [[Entrepreneur]]s has appeared in several places. A pracademic degree &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dream-start.com/pracademic%20degree.htm Pracademic Degree] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922063618/http://www.dream-start.com/pracademic%20degree.htm |date=2008-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance describes the case of a new degree in the UK that is taught by practitioners to students who want to be entrepreneurs. However this use of the term remains close to the main definition of bridging the academic and practical professional world. Additionally many academics now describe themselves as Pracademics on their web sites and this use of the term aligns well with definition set out here. There may be other uses of the term.

In 2000 the term was used to describe Ross James, who conceptualised the Transitional Learning Model &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Transitional_Learning_Model.html?id=ysoSAAAACAAJ The Transitional Learning Model: A Handbook for Training Design - Ross W. James - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; following extensive research for his doctoral dissertation. The model integrated learning and cross-cultural theories into a practical model to help workplace trainers design and deliver training. The model has been applied in a wide range of workplace settings. Health Communication Resources &lt;ref&gt;[http://h-c-r.org/ Health Communication Resources&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; has used the model in its extensive international delivery of resources for training learner-centred trainers in international radio broadcast networks.
    
The term was first used in relation to the UK [[resilience (organizational)|resilience community]] at the inaugural conference of the Institute of Civil Protection and Emergency Management (April 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icpem.net/Resources/Documentlinks/tabid/107/Default.aspx ICPEM | Institute of Civil Protection and Emergency Management | Document links&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Simpson from the [[London Fire Brigade]], who undertook a Master’s programme at [[Leicester University]] as a mature student, described people like himself and others in the resilience community as ‘pracademics’ and showed delegates the ‘Pracademic Curve’, which clearly illustrated the inter-relationship between the practitioner and academic communities, particularly as it affects those who go into academia having already embarked on a career as a practitioner.

In 2008, the term was introduced in the Criminal Justice education arena, with a paper and presentation entitled The Pracademic and Academic in Criminal Justice Education at the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences by Stephen A. Morreale of Worcester State University and James E. McCabe of Sacred Heart University. The paper focuses on the benefit of blending faculty that represent both the academic and pracademic perspectives, for the benefit of both the academic department and Criminal Justice students.    

Many designers also have started taking interest in this term lately in their theories, research as well as practice. In 2008, Ahmedabad based architectural firm has named their office as studio prAcademics. Studio is led by Tejas Kathiriya providing architecture, interior design and urban design services. They are involved in merging the design theories with professional practice and vice versa.

In 2013, the term was introduced to the field of teacher education as well. Writing about teacher education practices in general, and teacher education in the Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) in particular, Jain &lt;ref&gt;Jain, R. (2013) Practitioner Research as Dissertation: Exploring the Continuities between Practice and Research in a Community College ESL Classroom. Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Maryland, College Park. Retrieved from http://hdl.handle.net/1903/14515.&lt;/ref&gt; theorized about the relevance of the term to the lives of those who work on the intersections of practice and research. Jain used the term 'pracademic' to (re)imagine her professional identity as that comprising a coherent, albeit hybridized, unity--that of a practitioner as well as an academic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11031">The '''Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies''' ('''PIAAC''') is a worldwide study by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in 24 countries of cognitive and workplace skills. The main aim is to be able to assess the skills of [[literacy]], [[numeracy]] and [[problem solving]] in technology-rich
environments, and use the collected information to help countries develop ways to further improve these skills. The focus is on the working-age population (between the ages of 16 and 65). The first data was released on October 8, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=OECD Skills Outlook 2013|author=OECD|year=2013|url=http://skills.oecd.org/skillsoutlook.html|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thorn2009"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Since the early 1990s the need for assessing literary skills in developed countries has been addressed by two large international surveys. The first was the [[International Adult Literacy Survey]] (IALS) which was
implemented in 1994, 1996, and 1998. The second was the [[International Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey]] carried out in 2003, and between 2006 and 2008.&lt;ref name="nces.ed.gov"&gt;http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/all/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic Skills Assessed==
Three central basic skills are assessed in PIAAC: literacy, numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environments.&lt;ref name="Beatrice Rammstedt, Daniela Ackermann, Susanne Helmschrott, Anja Klaukien, Débora B. Maehler, Silke Martin, Natascha Massing and Anouk Zabal 2013"&gt;{{cite book|title=PIAAC 2012: Overview of the Main Results|author1=Beatrice Rammstedt |author2=Daniela Ackermann |author3=Susanne Helmschrott |author4=Anja Klaukien |author5=Débora B. Maehler |author6=Silke Martin |author7=Natascha Massing |author8=Anouk Zabal |year=2013|url=http://www.gesis.org/fileadmin/piaac/Downloadbereich/PIAAC_Zusammenfassung_engl.pdf|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literacy===
Literacy encompasses the ability to understand, use and interpret written texts. Literacy is a prerequisite for developing one’s knowledge and potential and participating in society. The literacy domain in PIAAC includes tasks such as reading and understanding a drug label or a brief newspaper article. In addition, there are tasks that involve digital media, such as reading an online job posting.

===Numeracy===
Numeracy refers to the ability to access, use and interpret everyday mathematical information in order to manage mathematical demands in daily life. This is measured, for example, with items involving the evaluation of a special offer or the interpretation of numerical information in figures and tables.

===Problem solving in technology-rich environments===
PIAAC is the first international survey to implement problem solving in technology-rich environments ([[Information and Communication Technology|ICT]]). This key skill is defined as the ability to successfully use digital technologies, communication tools and networks to search for, communicate and interpret information. The first wave of PIAAC focuses on how persons access and make use of information in a computer-based environment. Items include sorting and sending e-mails, filling out digital forms, and evaluating the informational content and credibility of different websites.

==Survey Design==
PIAAC was initiated by the OECD member states in 2008 and, like PISA, it is designed as a multi-cycle programme. Round 1 took place in 2008-13 (main study in 2011&lt;ref name="nces.ed.gov"/&gt;), supplementary Round 2 in 2012-16, and Round 3 in 2014-18 (main study in 2016-17).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/site/piaac/surveyofadultskills.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent cycles will allow future changes in adult skills to be monitored and analysed and will provide first indications of where improvements have been achieved and deficits persist. Twenty-four countries participated in PIAAC Round I. Nine additional countries also expressed interest in participating in PIAAC. At least 5 000 randomly selected respondents between the ages of 16 and 65 were interviewed and assessed in each participating country. The survey was carried out as a personal interview comprising a questionnaire followed by a skills assessment, a computer- or paper-based version of which was independently completed by the respondent in the presence of the interviewer; the entire interview (including the assessment) took between 1 1/2 and 2 hours to administer.&lt;ref name="Beatrice Rammstedt, Daniela Ackermann, Susanne Helmschrott, Anja Klaukien, Débora B. Maehler, Silke Martin, Natascha Massing and Anouk Zabal 2013"/&gt;

==Results==
The results were published in 2013, together with summaries in 25 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OECD|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes:''' 
#Sub-national entities (Belgium and UK) are placed at the end followed by two partner countries (Cyprus and Russia) who took part. The figures for Russia are preliminary and do not include Moscow or any items in the 'Missing' category.
#Participants were ranked at 5 levels (3 in problem solving). Level 1 corresponds to 176 points. Those who scored less than level 1 are listed above as well as those marked as 'Non-starters' above or 'Missing' in the report, referring to 'literacy-related non-responses' due to mental or learning disabilities or language difficulties. These were marked at 85 (out of 500) in calculating the mean figures.
#The last three columns show the extra points scored on average by the first group compared with the second. The last compares native-born native language speakers with foreign-born foreign language speakers.
#France, Italy, Spain and Cyprus did not participate in the Problem Solving test, which is officially described as 'Problem Solving in technology-rich environments'. The 'No ICT' column includes those who had no computer experience, opted out or failed a basic IT competence test.
#Cyprus only refers to that part under control of the Republic of Cyprus.

===Competence groups===
*Missing: Individuals at this level were unable to complete the background questionnaire.
*Below Level 1: can read brief texts on familiar topics and locate a single piece of specific information identical in form to information in the question or directive. 
*Level 1: (176 points) can complete simple forms, understand basic vocabulary, determine the meaning of sentences, and read continuous texts with a degree of fluency.
*Level 2: (226 points) can integrate two or more pieces of information based on criteria, compare and contrast or reason about information and make low-level inferences
*Level 3: (276 points) can understand and respond appropriately to dense or lengthy texts, including continuous, non-continuous, mixed, or multiple pages.
*Level 4: (326 points) can perform multiple-step operations to integrate, interpret, or synthesise information from complex or lengthy continuous, non-continuous, mixed, or multiple-type texts that involve conditional and/or competing information.
*Level 5: (376 points) can perform tasks that involve searching for and integrating information across multiple, dense texts; constructing syntheses of similar and contrasting ideas or points of view, or evaluating evidence and arguments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20700">A '''qualifications framework''' is a formalized structure in which [[learning level descriptors]] and qualifications are used in order to understand learning outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=Qualifications%20Framework|title=Qualifications Framework|last=|first=|date=|website=UNESCO-UNEVOC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for the ability to develop, assess and improve quality education in a number of contexts. Qualifications frameworks are typically found at the National, Regional, and International level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=10, 12–13, 15–16, 21, 31–33, 35, 76–77, 80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The origin of qualification structures can be traced back to organized education in antique civilizations such as [[Greece]], [[Sparta]], [[Rome]] and [[China]]. As no specialized career structure existed in these cultures, organized education focused on broad issues of international citizenship, and not on vocational preparedness, which was achieved mainly through informal apprenticeships. As civilizations developed, the role of social class and caste received more emphasis, and people who displayed certain competences were grouped together. The advantage of having participated in and benefited from education gradually became more visible as civilizations developed. In this respect the Chinese civilization was the most organized, with a series of levels attached to examinations, which in turn granted the right of access to public office. During the [[Middle Ages]] education had a particularly religious nature, while the late medieval centuries were categorized by a new approach to education alongside the clergy and feudal knighthood. New economic objectives as a result of the [[Crusades]] and the development of banking, importing and shipping across Europe and the West gave rise to the development of cities, and a new form of education aimed at professional life. Education became available to the middle classes, and the merchant and craft guild system developed.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;De Villiers, H. C. 1997. Affirmative action and the qualification structure. Unpublished Master's dissertation, University of Pretoria.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first institutions of formal higher education were established at this time in the Islamic universities of [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]] in Cairo and [[Sankore Madrasah|Sankore]] in Timbuktu.&lt;ref&gt;Serpell, R. 2007. Bridging between orthodox Western higher educational practices and an African sociocultural context. ''Comparative Education'', Vol. 43, No. 1, pp. 23–51.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; By the eleventh century, universities were developing in Europe, largely in reaction to the previous narrow religious doctrine. The establishment of the [[University of Bologna]] marked the beginning of the European university tradition. This was also the time when the term 'qualification' acquired a more definite meaning, although it retained its emphasis on social class structures. The nineteenth century brought with it a wave of liberalism and consciousness of equal rights and opportunities, accompanied by increased specialization and bureaucratization.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The increased need for skilled employees eventually resulted in an emphasis on&amp;nbsp;credentials which persists to the present day. During the twentieth century the emphasis shifted to [[Human Capital Theory|human capital theory]] and technological development, eventually leading to concerns whether the education system was able to meet the demands of the labour market. At the time it was argued that the strong divisions were creating barriers to learning, and that there was a need to do away with the sharp distinction between academic and vocational systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the late 1980s, and strongly influenced by the thinking on integration but also by a focus on vocational training through a competency approach, the notion of a National Qualification Frameworks (NQF) emerged in the United Kingdom. Its roots lay in the competence approach to vocational education which was broadened by Jessup,&lt;ref&gt;Jessup, G. 1991. ''Outcomes: NVQs and the Emerging Model of Education mid Training''. New York, RoutledgeFalmer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Scottish Action Plan]] which led to the modularization of vocational education and training in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Education Department (SED). 1983. ''16–18s in Scotland: An Action Plan''. Edinburgh, SED.&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea developed that all qualifications could be expressed in terms of outcomes without prescribing learning pathways or programmes.&lt;ref&gt;Young, M. F. D. 2005. ''National Qualifications Frameworks: Their Feasibility and Effective Implementation in Developing Countries''. Geneva, ILO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Within this politically charged melting pot of factors, and a renewed emphasis on the importance of lifelong learning, the first NQFs were established in Australia, England, Scotland, New Zealand, Ireland and South Africa between 1989 and 1995.&amp;nbsp;France, as a country with a different, notably non-Anglo Saxon tradition, was also a member of this group of first-generation NQFs (Bouder, 2003; Keevy et al., 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Bouder, A. 2003. Qualifications in France: towards a national framework? Journal of Education and Work, Vol. 16, No. 3, pp. 347–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keevy, J., Charraud, A. and Allgoo, K. 2011. National qualifications frameworks developed in Anglo-Saxon and French traditions. Considerations for sustainable development in Africa. Research report for the ADEA Triennial on Education and Training in Africa, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, 27 November – 2 December 2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of France, the NQF drew on a hierarchy of qualifications that found official expression at the end of 1960s in a nomenclature which tried to rationalize the number of students leaving the education and training system to correspond with the needs of the labour market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Across the first-generation countries, NQFs were conceptualized as hierarchical classifications of levels of formal learning programmes and their associated qualifications and certificates.&lt;ref&gt;Coles, M., Keevy, J., Bateman, A. and Keating, J. 2014. Flying blind: policy rationales for national qualifications frameworks and how they tend to evolve.&lt;/ref&gt; Integral features of NQFs included new quality assurance and standards-setting regimes based on learning outcomes, and importantly for this study, level descriptors which are used to determine the level at which a qualification should be pegged.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck, R. 2007. An Introductory Guide to NQFs: Conceptual and Practical Issues for Policy Makers. Geneva, ILO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

== Construction ==
All qualifications frameworks are learning outcomes-based. In qualifications frameworks, qualifications are developed using learning outcomes, and the set of hierarchical levels they consist of are described with a set of learning level descriptors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Qualifications frameworks emerged from two complementary education and training discourses in the late 1980s: the competence approach to [[vocational education]], and the shift to learning outcomes, embedded within the broader concept of [[lifelong learning]]. As a result, the interrelationship between competences and learning outcomes was not only firmly embedded in qualifications framework thinking from the very outset, but was also used in a hybridized form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

== National level ==
{{Main|National Qualifications Framework}}

A National Qualifications Framework (NQF) addresses the educational quality concerns of specific countries. Some examples include:
* [[Australian Qualifications Framework]] (AQF)
* [[Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework]] (SCQF)
* German Qualifications Framework (Deutsche Qualifikationsrahmen, DQR)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Regional level ==
A Regional Qualifications Framework (RQF) focuses specifically on qualifications at the regional level. Some examples include:
* [[European Qualifications Framework]] (EQF)
* [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]] RQF 
* [[Caribbean Community|CARICOM]] TVET Qualifications Framework (TVET QF) 
* [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] RQF
* Qualifications Framework for the [[European Higher Education Area]] (QF-EHEA) 
* Pacific Qualifications Register (PQR)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== International level/World reference levels ==
The purpose of the world reference levels lies mainly in their potential to provide a neutral and independent reference point against which a level of learning can be assessed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The idea of a set of world reference levels was considered in May 2012, during the Third International Congress on [[TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)|TVET]], held in [[Shanghai|Shanghai, China]]. The research included in this report was initiated by [[UNESCO]] based on the recommendation from the Congress to the UNESCO Director-General to undertake this work. The UNESCO TVET Section, in cooperation with the European Commission's [[Directorate-General for Education and Culture|Directorate General for Education and Culture]] and the [[European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training]] (CEDEFOP), subsequently invited key organizations in [[Brussels]] to deliberate on the [[Shanghai Consensus Recommendation]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;UNESCO. 2012. Shanghai Consensus: Recommendations of the Third International Congress on Technical and Vocational Education and Training 'Transforming TVET: Building skills for work and life', Shanghai, People's Republic of China, 14 to 16 May.&lt;/ref&gt; in September 2013. The deliberations included regional developments in Europe, notably the [[European Qualifications Framework]] (EQF) and in Asia, notably a common standard for competences developed by the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|Association of South East Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), as well as the move towards [[regional qualifications frameworks]] (RQFs) in [[Central America]] and the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC). At the national level, the development of [[National Qualifications Framework|national qualifications frameworks]] (NQFs) was considered across and beyond these regions, including [[Mercosur]] (Mercado Común del Sur, the Common Market of the South) in South America and the development of a [[transnational qualifications framework]] (TQF) by twenty-nine small states of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;COL and SAQA. 2008. Transnational Qualifications Framework for the Virtual University of Small States of the Commonwealth. Concept Document. Pretoria: Commonwealth of Learning and South African Qualifications Authority.&lt;/ref&gt; The additional dimension of learning metrics as used in longitudinal studies, international competence assessments and diagnostics reviews was also considered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Brussels deliberations concluded that the mobility of people (both learners and workers, including migrant workers) and jobs (including outsourcing and offshoring) constitutes an important driver for the world reference levels&lt;ref&gt;Chakroun. 2013. Outcomes of the workshop, Engaging global conversations on recognition of TVET quali cations based on learning outcomes, 25–27 September 2013, Brussels, unpublished report.&lt;/ref&gt; emanating from the Shanghai Consensus Recommendation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was noted that jobs are not always matched to demands during these movements, because of demographic shifts and the differential capacities of economies to create jobs. The cross-border provision of education and training, as well as the technological developments resulting in increased open and distance learning, and online learning, were also identified as important drivers towards world reference levels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another important driver identified in the Brussels deliberations was the need for international dialogue, cooperation and capacity-building in the  field of the recognition of qualifications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Other types of frameworks ==

=== Sectoral qualifications frameworks&amp;nbsp;===
Sectoral qualifications frameworks are developed within a specific country and with a specific sectoral focus. Examples include: 
* a TVET framework in Jamaica 
* the occupational qualifications subframework in South Africa 
* the General Education Qualifications Framework in Poland
* the Engineering Sectoral Framework in Armenia&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

=== Transnational qualifications frameworks&amp;nbsp;===
Transnational qualifications frameworks are developed across a range of countries. Where these countries are in the same geographical proximity they are referred to as regional qualifications frameworks (examples include the SADC RQF and the EQF). Transnational qualifications frameworks can also be developed across countries that are not in the same geographic proximity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

=== For online learning ===

==== The E-xcellence framework ====
The E-xcellence framework was developed by the European Association of Distance Teaching Universities (EADTU). It is an instrument for benchmarking the quality of online, open and flexible education at programme, faculty and institutional levels. The framework defines requirements (called "benchmarks") for the entire process, from [[Curriculum development|curriculum design]] to delivery, including the management and support of online and blended learning.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002451/245122E.pdf|title=Making Sense of MOOCs: A Guide for Policy-Makers in Developing Countries|last=Patru|first=Mariana|last2=Balaji|first2=Venkataraman|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100157-4|location=|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The OpenupEd quality label ====
The OpenupEd quality label is derived from the E-xcellence framework. Ossiannilsson and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Ossiannilsson, E., Williams, K., Camilleri, A., &amp; Brown, M. (2015). ''Quality models in online and open education around the globe: State of the art and recommendations''. Oslo, Norway: International Council for Open and Distance Education.&lt;/ref&gt; identified this framework as useful for certification and benchmarking. The label describes a self-assessment and review Quality Assurance (QA) process for the [[Massive open online course|MOOCs]] (Massive open online courses) in the European OpenupEd partnership,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.openuped.eu&lt;/ref&gt; but the OpenupEd framework can be used for the QA of any MOOC. The benchmarks statements in this label, derived from benchmarks produced by the E-xcellence framework, are divided into two groups: those that apply at the institutional level and those for individual courses (MOOCs).&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

== Learning level descriptors ==
{{Main|Learning level descriptors}}

Learning level descriptors are essential elements in Qualifications Frameworks. Learning Level descriptors are statements that provide a broad indication of learning appropriate to attainment at a particular level, describing the characteristics and context of learning expected at that level. They are designed to support the reviewing of specified learning outcomes and assessment criteria in order to develop particular modules and units and to assign credits at the appropriate level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vlasceanu, L., Grünberg, L. and Pârlea, D. 2007. Quality assurance and accreditation: a glossary of basic terms and de nitions. Bucharest, UNESCO Centre Européen pour l'Enseignement Supérieur (CEPES). &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001346/134621e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Learning outcomes ==
A learning outcome is a measurable result of a learning experience which allows us to ascertain to which extent / level / standard a competence has been formed or enhanced.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lokho , J., Wegewijs, B., Durkin, K., Wagenaar, R., González, J., Isaacs, A., Rose, L. and Gobbi, M. (eds). 2010. ''A Tuning Guide to Formulating Degree Programme Profiles Including Programme Competences and Programme Learning Outcomes''. Bilbao, Groningen and The Hague. Manabile, E. 2007. Summary of the revised Bloom's taxonomy. Unpublished.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learning outcomes can be used to describe many things, including knowledge, skills and competences (KSC), in the context of qualifications frameworks. Learning outcomes are increasingly being used in global context 'as a dynamic tool for modernisation and reform'.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;CEDEFOP. 2009. ''The Shift to Learning Outcomes''. Luxembourg, CEDEFOP.&lt;/ref&gt; The key mechanism through which the learning outcomes approach is being implemented is qualifications frameworks, but there are also others, such as within [[curriculum]] reform on both national and international levels. [[The Tuning Project]], which started in 2000, stands out as a good example of the introduction of learning outcomes outside of, but nonetheless related to, qualifications frameworks. Learning outcomes are used in the formulation of qualifications, and also in the formulation of level descriptors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Definitions of the concept of learning outcomes vary across contexts, although some common elements can be identified. Here are several definitions. Learning outcomes...
* Describe what students will know and be able to do upon successful completion of a course or programme.&lt;ref&gt;University of Adelaide. 2014. Guide to writing learning outcomes. www.adelaide.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt;
* The contextually demonstrated end-products of specific learning processes which include knowledge, skills and values.&lt;ref&gt;SAQA. 2014. NQFpedia: Standard Glossary of Terms. www.saqa.org.za&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Statements of what a learner knows, understands and is able to do after the completion of learning.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* A statement of what students should know, understand and can do upon the completion of a period of study.&lt;ref&gt;MQA. 2011. ''Malaysian Qualifications Framework. Point of Reference and joint understanding of higher education qualifications in Malaysia''. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian Quali cations Authority.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Knowledge, skill, and aspects of competence that a learner is expected to know and be able to do.&lt;ref&gt;NQAUAE. 2012. ''Qualifications Framework Emirates Handbook''. Abu Dhabi, NQAUAE.&lt;/ref&gt;
From a review of the interpretation of learning outcomes it is evident that learning outcomes are understood to be statements that describe mainly three major domains: knowledge (learning to know), skills (learning to do) and competences (learning to be).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 1996. Learning: ''The Treasure Within. Report of the International Commission on Education for the 21st Century''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competences ===
The interrelationship between learning outcomes and competences is best illustrated in qualifications frameworks.&amp;nbsp;While learning outcomes often describe competences, competences can also be stand alone. Competences represent a dynamic combination of cognitive and meta-cognitive skills, demonstration of knowledge and understanding, interpersonal, intellectual and practical skills, and ethical values.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3512">'''REPLAY''' is a management system for audiovisual content developed at [[ETH Zurich]].

==Background==
REPLAY was developed as the future Multimedia Portal of [[ETH Zurich]] within the scope of the [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] strategy 2006–2009 and got branded „REPLAY“ in 2007. It is to manage the audiovisual content of [[ETH Zurich]] from production to distribution in an automated manner.

==Application area==
The main focus of REPLAY is the quasi-automated handling of large number of [[lecture recording]]s (&gt;150 per week) and to provide an integrated management solution for other video objects (films, [[digitizing|digitization]] results etc.). Thus, it covers all the audiovisual material usually to be found in academic and other institutions (museums, companies etc.). 

==Workflow==
REPLAY covers the complete lifecycle of the audiovisual objects: In the classroom / lecture hall, the [[Linux]]-based Playmobil as an additional hardware component automatically captures audio, video, and [[VGA]] (for slides/presentations/computer display/other devices). After the lecture, these sources are bundled with metadata and proceeded into the REPLAY backend. Other video material can be ingested through an inbox.

All bundles are then:
* archived,
* indexed (based on slide content, using [[Optical Character Recognition]]),
* encoded according to settings and
* distributed in various channels ([[RSS]], streaming, download etc.)
One of the distribution channels is Interplay, a user interface designed for interactive consumption of video.

==Qualities==
REPLAY is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Open-source software|open source]] and oriented towards standards wherever possible. It is modular in design and envisaged to run on a singular machine as well as in a distributed environment.

==License==
{{Portal|Free software}}
REPLAY is [[Open-source software|open source]] under [[GNU Lesser General Public License|GNU LGPL license version 2]]. 

== Development ==
[https://web.archive.org/web/20090403002529/http://replay.origo.ethz.ch/ Development website]. Replay has been developed towards release 0.7 (March 2009); as of June 2009 the project has ended and support was suspended by the end of 2009. Efforts around REPLAY and its technology are being transferred to the [[Opencast Matterhorn]] project.

The '''Renren Network''' ({{zh|s=人人网|hp=Rénrénwǎng|l=Everyone's Network}}), formerly known as the '''Xiaonei Network''' ({{zh|c=校内网|l=on-campus network}}) is a [[China|Chinese]] [[social networking service]] similar to [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/05/renren/ Renren, China's 'Facebook', Raises $740 Million in IPO]. 4 May 2011.

Renren also has offices in [[Shanghai]] and [[Guangzhou]].

== History ==
Renren, which started as Xiaonei.com, was founded by a group of students, including [[Wang Xing]], Wang Huiwen and Lai Binqiang at Tsinghua University and Tianjin University in December 2005. Joseph Chen, who had himself tried to launch a student community website called ChinaRen as early as 1999 and sold it in 2000, acquired Xiaonei through his new company Oak Pacific in October 2006.

Born in 1970 in China, Chen moved with his family to the US where he studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and later earned an MBA from Stanford University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/MD22Cb01.html|title=Asia Times Online : Renren seeks US listing, Apr 22, 2011|website=www.atimes.com|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remains the chairman and CEO.[6]

In March 2008, Xiaonei launched its WAP version, which users can access through mobile phones.[7] Xiaonei features an instant messaging service (Rénrénzhuōmiàn, Chinese: 人人桌面) designed typically for its users using XMPP, which is more popular than Facebook chat.[8]&lt;!-- the mention "more popular than Facebook chat" could be out of date and might have to be deleted. Also unlcear why "chat" and not "instant messaging" --&gt;

In August 2009, Xiaonei officially changed its name to Renren, as well as its domain to www.renren.com. And also, the logo has changed from the Chinese word "xiaonei" to the Chinese word "renren"("ren", meaning "people" or "person", and "everyone" when used twice in a row). This name change from 'inside the school' (Xiaonei 校内) to 'everybody' (renren 人人) reflected the expansion aspirations held by Oak Pacific – to be more than a network dedicated to students, but instead be the biggest Chinese social network website.[9]

In April 2011, the company filed with the SEC to raise $584 million in a US IPO,[5] offering Renren stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The company reported 2010 revenue of $76 million USD.[10]

At the beginning of creating "renren.com", users were only able to use specific IP address from specified colleges. This action was to encourage all the users to use their true names to post blogs and pictures.

== Corporate affairs ==
Renren Inc. has its headquarters on the 23rd floor of the Jing An Center (S: 静安中心, T: 靜安中心, P: ''Jìng'ān Zhōngxīn'') in [[Chaoyang District, Beijing|Chaoyang District]], [[Beijing]]. Renren has its Shanghai office in the [[SOHO China|SOHO]] Zhong Shan Square (S: SOHO中山广场, T: SOHO中山廣場, P: ''SOHO Zhōngshān Guǎngchǎng'') in [[Changning District]], [[Shanghai]]. Renren has its Guangzhou office in the China Shine Plaza (S: 耀中广场, T: 耀中廣場, P: ''Yàozhōng Guǎngchǎng'') in [[Tianhe District]], [[Guangzhou]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.renren-inc.com/en/contact/ Contact Us]." Renren Corporate. Retrieved on November 19, 2012. "Renren Inc.

== Open platform ==
In July 2007, Xiaonei officially facilitated its [[open platform]], allowing third parties to integrate with platform by rendering modifications and adding functionalities. The APIs Xiaonei listed are quite similar with those Facebook provided, and some of Xiaonei's developers are developing based on the SDK of Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.xiaonei.com/wiki/%E9%A6%96%E9%A1%B5 校内开放平台 Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/API Facebook Developers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://group.xiaonei.com/GetThread.do?id=327168364&amp;parentpage=0&amp;curpage=0&amp;label=&amp;tribeId=237768885 校内群组 - PHP开发Xiaonei应用库v1.0发布，是基于facebook php5库]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Privacy policy ==
Renren has a privacy policy to preserve personal information. Different privacy levels for profile, contact info and blogs can be modified in the privacy settings, thus others that fail to match the privacy requirements cannot browse the specific information or contents of a given user.

In April 2008, [[SoftBank]] bought a 14% share of Xiaonei, becoming its largest shareholder. As a result, a rumor came out that “the personal data of millions of Chinese college students on Xiaonei will be exposed to the Japanese since the Japanese company became the boss of Xiaonei". Soon, such claim was spread all over various popular forums, QQ groups, and social networking sites like Xiaonei. Later, Xiaonei declared the denouncement towards its rivals for slander and denied what had been described in the rumor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.163.com/wl_bermuda/blog/static/1089248220085211386436/ 雷总管直面校内网CEO陈一舟，谈校内网被日本软银收购一事]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Privacy leak April 2011 ===
On April 29, 2011 a number of Renren users received a personal message saying that there's someone loving you, along with a piece of malicious code, providing the user's ID, name, school, birth date, cell-phone number, MSN, etc. to a third-party website. Such personal message exploited a bug of Renren and a built-in automatic-forwarding feature. So a great number of users were affected.
On the next day, such news was reported by major IT news websites in China but those articles were removed. Only a series of screenshots,&lt;ref&gt;http://i.imgur.com/4r3FN.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://i.imgur.com/NCUi5.png&lt;/ref&gt; a short statement&lt;ref&gt;http://page.renren.com/699131345/note/724338594&lt;/ref&gt; and a piece of attacking code survived.
The community has criticized Renren's reaction towards this event. They did not clarify what happened to its users or to the media, but tried to delete the data and also made use of its public relationship team to delete the posts on every IT news websites.

== Functions ==
Renren is a typical SNS with a variety of functions with its own characteristics. In general, it is updated once or twice a year when the system's functions require rectification and further development. In addition, it changes the web page's design on special days, like Spring Festival or National Day.

=== Profile ===
As Renren mainly caters to college students, the key information to make one’s identity effective is [[college]], [[high school]], [[middle school]] and hometown. At present, 32,000 universities and colleges, 56,000 high schools and 85,000 companies in China and 1,500 universities in 29 other countries are available on Renren’s confirmation system. The social networks for each of these specified colleges, schools and companies have been established.
In the additional section of personal profiles, users can also put on information about their contact information, hobbies, favorite music, movies, the clubs they joined, etc. To personalize the profile, Renren has also developed functions to edit profile music and background.

=== Friends ===
Registered users can add friends to the friend list. By specifying educational information in the profile, a user can easily find other users. Users can be also affiliated with groups (usually an existing class, school or organization).

=== Applications and censorship ===
There are some common kinds of expressions on Renren, such as renewing the mood (lit. updating personal state), blogging, voting and sharing others’ blogs. In addition, users upload photos and share photos, articles  and external links (usually videos). Leaving a message or commenting on photos, blogs, status, etc. is quite commonly seen; the interacting users leaving and replying to messages is considered a prominent instance of basic communication on Renren. Activities can be held online by calling on friends to participate. There are also several peripheral applications, such as online mini games, regular games, doggies, testing, parking lot, and selling and buying of friends.

However, Renren's censorship is fairly strict, especially to sensitive keywords in the blogs, compared with other SNS websites in China. Blog entries containing keywords like [[Tiananmen Square Massacre]], [[Falun Gong]] and [[Zhao Ziyang]] cannot be released. Others that are suspected to be related to political topics, obscenity or thrillers are manually censored by administrators, delaying or blocking their release.

Renrenzhuomian is a kind of instant message service provided to renren.net users and it is established on year 2009. It allows users viewing news and messages online, generating new short blogs, replying to others, and forwarding news by simply opening this software and logging into the account.

Nowadays, people show more preference to install this simple and smart program to log into Renren, browsing and sharing news with others, rather than login to the original webpage on browsers. This is mainly because the establishment of Renrenzhuomian mobile app (for both IOS and Android). People can log into their renren accounts anywhere and this is much more convenient.

=== Academic studies ===
Unlike many other social networks, Renren has collaborated with academic researchers to understand the growth and structure of its user community. The results have produced several academic publications. One of the first studies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2010/ |title= Understanding Latent Interactions in Online Social Networks |author=Jing Jiang  |author2=Christo Wilson |author3=Xiao Wang |author4=Peng Huang |author5=Wenpeng Sha |author6=Yafei Dai |author7=Ben Y. Zhao  |date= November 2010 |booktitle=Proc. of Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) |location= Melbourne, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the Renren social graph structure and found it similar to prior studies of Facebook's social graph. The study also used Renren's unique feature, a per-user "recent visitors" log, to create an anonymous history of users and how they browse each other's profiles, which was the first of its kind.  A second study &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2011/ |title=Uncovering Social Network Sybils in the Wild |author=Zhi Yang |author2=Christo Wilson |author3=Xiao Wang |author4=Tingting Gao |author5=Ben Y. Zhao |author6=Yafei Dai
   |date= November 2011 |booktitle=Proc. of Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) |location=Berlin, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt; detailed the process of analyzing and improving detection of fake users (also called Sybil accounts) on Renren.

=== Points and levels ===
Renren users earn "points" for various activities, such as logging in regularly, posting updates, and receiving comments and replies from contacts. As users earn points, their "level" on the website increases, and at certain levels users gain extra privileges such as access to additional emoticons, [[skin (computing)|skins]] for their profile, and the ability to view other users' profiles without their knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sc.renren.com/scores/help | title=成长体系介绍 (Introduction to the maturation system) | accessdate=2011-06-20 | publisher = Renren}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, users can gain access to all privileges by paying a monthly fee to become a VIP user.

=== Renrendou ===
The '''Renrendou''', or '''Renren beans''' (人人豆), is the virtual currency on Renren. Due to some functions charging users fees, Renrendou can be used to purchase gifts, commence the Purple Bean service (紫豆服务), exchange for game coins and advertise. 1 RMB is equivalent to 1 Renrendou.

== Kaixin ==
Renren's parent company, Oak Pacific Interactive, launched a copy of [[Kaixin001]] called Kaixin. On September 29, 2010, Oak Pacific announced it would integrate Renren with Kaixin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinatechnews.com/2010/09/29/12550-oak-pacific-to-integrate-two-chinese-social-media-websites Oak Pacific To Integrate Two Chinese Social Media Websites]&lt;/ref&gt; Users can use the same username to log into Renren and Kaixin. Kaixin used the same layout as Kaixin001.

On April 11, 2011, Renren was found guilty of infringing on Kaixin001's rights and ordered to pay 400,000 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] to its rival. Kaixin001.com announced on April 26, 2011 that it had appealed the April 11 ruling as it was unsatisfied with the amount of compensation as well as the lack of change regarding Renren's usage of Kaixin.com. It also demanded an official apology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.globaltimes.cn/industries/2011-04/649453.html Kaixin 001 seeks more compensation] GlobalTimes&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''research fellow''' is an academic [[research]] position at a [[university]] or a similar research institution, usually for [[Academic rank|academic staff or faculty members]]. A research fellow may act either as an independent investigator or under the supervision of a principal investigator.

In contrast to a [[research assistant]], the position of research fellow normally requires a [[Doctorate|doctoral degree]], or equivalent work experience for instance in industry and research centers. Some research fellows undertake [[postdoctoral research]] or have some moderate teaching responsibilities. Research fellow positions vary in different countries and academic institutions. In some cases, they are permanent with the possibility of promotion, while in other instances they are temporary.

==United Kingdom==
In many universities this position is a career grade of a ''Research Career Pathway'', following on from a postdoctoral position such as Research Associate, and may be open-ended, subject to normal probation regulations. Within such a path, the next two higher career grades are usually senior research fellow and professorial fellow. Although similar to the position of a research fellow, these two positions are research only posts, with the rise of the career grade there will normally be a formal requirement of a moderate amount of teaching and/or supervision (often at postgraduate level). These positions are for researchers with a proven track record of generating research income to fund themselves and producing high-quality research output that is internationally recognised.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In some universities, research career grades roughly correspond to the grades of the ''Teaching and Scholarship Career Pathways'' in the following way: research fellow—[[lecturer]], professorial fellow—[[professor]], whereas senior research fellow is somewhere between a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] and a senior lecturer. However, at some top universities, a senior research fellowship may be a position of comparable academic standing to a full professorship at these universities, without any teaching requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asc.ox.ac.uk/categories-fellowship |title=All Souls College Oxford: Categories of Fellowship|publisher=asc.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the term research fellow often referred to a junior researcher, who worked on a specific project on a temporary basis. Research fellows tended to be paid either from central university funds or by an outside organisation such as a charity or company, or through an external grant-awarding body such as a research council or a royal society, for example in the [[Royal Society University Research Fellowship]].&lt;ref name=urf&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/university-research/|website=royalsociety.org|title=University Research Fellowship|author=Anon|year=2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203164426/https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/university-research/|archivedate=2016-02-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in [[Oxbridge]] style colleges, research fellows appointed as [[fellow]]s of a college tended to, or still do, partially receive remuneration in form of college housing and subsistence. Colleges may award junior research fellowships as the equivalent of [[post-doctoral research]] posts, lasting for three or four years. In contrast, senior research fellows tended to be established academics, often a professor on sabbatical from another institution, conducting temporally research elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==India==
In India, the position of research fellowship is provided to scholars from various streams like science, arts, literature, agriculture to reward their excellence {{Citation needed|reason=In Indian context they are Research Assistant positions and not Assistant Research fellows. There is a clear difference between the two as mentioned in the beginning of article)|date=August 2018}}. Research fellowship is funded by government academic and research institutes, and private companies as well. Research fellows research under the supervision of experienced faculty, professor, head of department, Dean on two different posts known as junior research fellow(JRF) and senior research fellow(SRF). Research organisations like ICAR, [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research|CSIR]], UGC, ICMR, SERB recruit research fellows through [[National Eligibility Test]]. After the completion of pre-defined tenure, JRF can be considered for senior research fellowship based on research fellow's performance &amp; interview conducted by committee by research institute, research fellow is working with.

==Russian Federation==
In the [[Russian Federation]], the position and title research fellow is unknown; however, there is a broadly similar position of ({{lang-ru|Научный сотрудник|italic=yes}}, literally "scientific worker"). This position normally requires a degree of [[Candidate of Sciences]] approximately corresponding to the PhD. More senior positions normally require, in addition to the aforementioned degree, a track record of publications or certified inventions, as well as practical contributions to major research and development projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==South Africa==
Research fellows in South Africa are considered as the best asset to research organisations and universities. There are highly ranked universities like University of the Witwatersrand, University of Stellenbosch Business School, rhode university which offers fellowship to South Africa's nationals in a certain field of research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usb.ac.za/Pages/Visiting-research-fellowships.aspx "Research Fellowship in South Africa"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipient of research fellowship==

In some countries, the English term research fellow is sometimes used to refer to the ''holder'' of a ''research fellowship'' that funds research.

In Germany, institutions such as the [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]] offer research fellowship for postdoctoral research and refer to the holder as research fellows, while the award holder may formally hold a specific title at his or her home institution (e.g., ''Privatdozent'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avh.de/web/884.html ''Ten Years' Growth - What Fruit Has the Georg Forster Programme Borne?''], Retrieved on 18 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ROOMMATES_....jpg|thumb|right|Roommates]]
A '''roommate''' is a person with whom one shares a living facility such as a [[room]] or [[dormitory]] without being family or romantically involved. Similar terms include '''dormmate''', '''suitemate''', '''housemate''', '''flatmate''' ("flat": the usual term in [[British English]] for an [[apartment]] – in New Zealand, "flatmate" is solely used, regardless of whether the dwelling is an apartment or a detached house), or '''sharemate''' (shared living spaces are often called ''sharehomes'' in Australia and other Commonwealth countries). A '''sharehome''' is a model of [[household]] in which a group of usually unrelated people reside together. The term generally applies to people living together in [[rental]] properties rather than in properties in which any resident is an [[Owner-occupier|owner occupier]]. In the UK, the term "roommate" means a person living in the same ''bedroom'', whereas in the United States and Canada, "roommate" and "housemate" are used interchangeably regardless whether a bedroom is shared, although it is common in US universities that having a roommate implies sharing a room together. This article uses the term "roommate" in the US sense of a person one shares a ''residence'' with who is not a relative or [[significant other]]. The informal term for roommate is '''roomie''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/thesaurus/american/roomie/roomie_4/Friends-and-acquaintances |title=Roomie definition |publisher=MacMillan Dictionary/Thesaurus |accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is commonly used by university students.

The most common reason for sharing housing is to reduce the cost of housing. In many rental markets, the monthly rent for a two- or three-bedroom apartment is proportionately less per bedroom than the rent for a one-bedroom apartment (in other words, a three-bedroom flat costs more than a one-bedroom, but not three times as much). By pooling their monthly housing money, a group of people can achieve a lower housing expense at the cost of less privacy. Other motivations are to gain better amenities than those available in single-person housing, to share the work of maintaining a household, and to have the companionship of other people.

People become roommates when they move into a rental property, with one or more of them having applied to rent the property through a [[real estate agent]], being accepted and having signed a [[lease]].

==Demographics==
Housemates and [https://www.flatmate.in roommates] are typically unmarried young adults, including workers and students. It is not rare for middle-aged and elderly adults who are single, divorced, or widowed to have housemates. Married couples, however, typically discontinue living with roommates, especially when they have children.

Those moving to another city or [[Expatriate|another country]] may decide to look for a shared house or apartment to avoid [[loneliness]]. Social changes such as the declining affordability of [[home ownership]] and decreasing [[marriage]] rates are reasons why people may choose to live with roommates.  Despite this rise, shared housing is little researched.&lt;ref name="research"&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a778613460~db=all Research about Share Housing]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roommates are a fairly common point of reference in Western culture. In the United States, most young adults spend at least a short part of their lives living with roommates after they leave their family's home. Very often this involves moving out of the home and to college, where the primary option for living is with a roommate. Therefore, many novels, movies, plays, and television programs employ roommates as a basic principle or a [[plot device]] (such as the popular series ''[[Friends]]'' or ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''). Sharing a house or a flat is also very common in European countries such as France (French ''colocation'', corenting) or Germany (German ''WG'' for ''Wohngemeinschaft'', living [together] community). Many websites are specialized in finding a flatmate. On the other hand, it is less common for people of any age to live with roommates in some countries, such as [[Japan]], where single-person one-room apartments are plentiful.

There are many different forms of flat shares also, from the more established flat shares where the flatmate will get their own room that is furnished to "couch surfing" where people lend their sofa for a short period.
Sharehome residents are typically unrelated to each other in that they generally come from different [[family|families]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}, although they may be composed of some [[sibling]]s and sometimes [[single parent]]s and their [[children]]. Perhaps because of the [[social cohesion]] required for their formation, sharehomes will often be composed of members of the same [[peer group]]. For example, [[university student]]s who have relocated to a new area to commence a course of study often need to form a sharehome. Share housing often occurs in the 18-35 age bracket – during a life stage between leaving home and having children. Sharehome residents may have pre-existing [[friendship]]s or other [[interpersonal relationship]]s or they may form new relationships whilst living together.

Many [[universities]] in the United States require first-year students to live in on-campus residence halls, sharing a [[dormitory]] room with a same-sex roommate.

==Popularity==

According to the [[American Community Survey]], 7.7% of Americans lived with a roommate in 2014. From 2000 to 2014, the proportion of Americans living with roommates increased by 13%, revealing that it is an increasingly popular lifestyle choice.&lt;ref name=priceonomics&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kopf|first1=Dan|title=Where Is the Roommate Capital of the United States?|url=http://priceonomics.com/where-is-the-roommate-capital-of-the-united-states/|website=Priceonomics|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change in the cost of housing makes the consideration of roommates more attractive. As the housing market increases, so too does the roommate ratio rate. When house prices drop, the opposite can be expected. This has been seen extensively in cities such as Washington D.C., Phoenix, and San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washtimes.com/business/20050627-093703-6322r.htm Washington Times – Wanted: Roommates&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Student exchange]]s are getting more and more popular with globalization and has influenced a lot in the Roommate Boom. The [[ERASMUS program|Erasmus exchange program]] in [[Europe]] has contributed as being the biggest exchange program in Europe. Exchange students can live in [[dormitory|university residences]] but a growing number want to share apartments with other international students in shared apartments.

Roommates and house-sharing are not limited to students and young adults however. American politicians [[Chuck Schumer]], [[William Delahunt]], [[Dick Durbin|Richard Durbin]], and [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] famously share a house in [[Washington, D.C.]] while Congress is in session.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/18/garden/18roomies.html Taking Power, Sharing Cereal], [[New York Times]], Jan. 18, 2007; [http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Politics/story?id=2942649 D.C. Lawmakers Share 'Animal House'], [[ABC News]], Mar. 12, 2007; [http://www.house.gov/list/hearing/ma10_delahunt/art_070118_bg_animalhouse.html Capitol Hill's Animal House is Their Home Away From Home], [[Boston Globe]], Jan. 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]]n universities and colleges it is quite common that students share their rooms with a couple of others. Usually students in the master or doctoral programs are allocated with own rooms.

Sharing an apartment is quite popular by young adults (most of them university students) in countries like [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]], while sharing a bedroom is more uncommon.

==Challenges==

One difficulty is finding suitable roommates. Living with a roommate can mean much less [[privacy]] than having a residence of one's own, and for some people this can cause a lot of [[stress (biology)|stress]]. Another thing to consider when choosing a roommate is how to divide the cost of living. Who pays for what, or are the shared expenses divided between the two or more roommates. Also, the potential roommate should be trusted to pay their share and trusted to pay it on time. Sleeping patterns can also be disrupted when living with a number of people. Some of the challenges that come with share housing may include advertising for, interviewing and choosing potential [[flatmate|housemates]]; sharing communal household goods, [[Renting|rent]] (often this may be determined by the size or position of respective [[bedroom]]s); sharing [[household]] bills and [[food|grocery]] costs; and sharing [[Homemaking|housework]], [[Housekeeping|cleaning]], and [[cooking]] responsibilities. Conflicts may arise if, for example, residents have different standards of [[cleanliness]], different [[Diet (nutrition)|diets]], or different hours of [[employment]] or study. Guests and partners may also begin to board frequently, which can raise complications pertaining to [[Public utility|utility expenses]], additional rent and further possible cleaning duties. Often when these responsibilities go untended, friction may result between co-tenants. For this reason, responsibilities should be delegated and fairly assigned as early as possible in any living arrangement with roommates. A clear and defined list of alternating chores and bill lists are easy to see and enforce.

Roommates matter, as they have a great impression upon the ones whom they live with and therefore surround themselves by. More and more research has been produced in order to properly understand this impact. The areas of impact can vary greatly in both positive and negative ways; most important is that individuals should be aware of the possible behaviour and social changes that may happen when living with a roommate.

===Eating and drinking habits===
Living with an individual who exercises and diets can be beneficial because it very often "rubs off" on the other roommates, while a calorie cutting roommate could be a potential negative influence. College is a time that students often start drinking, specifically binge drinking (more than 4 or 5 drinks in a row). By the end of second semester in college 53% of freshman students had binged. Students explained that having a drinking roommate provided a “buddy” to go through it all and was a big influence in the decision to do so. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[Mood (psychology)|Mood]] susceptible: "Each happy friend a person has increases that person's probability of being happy by 9 percent and each unhappy friend decreases it by 7 percent," says Nicholas A. Christakis, a co-author of "Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore|first=Abigail|title=The Science of Roommates|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/education/25roomscience-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the roommates are friends or not the interactions and behaviors shared and expressed will undoubtable have an effect on the roommates. Although shown not to be as impressionable as eating habits are moods can change, specifically more in male roommates based on the others emotions.

Effects on Studies: Studies showed that having a roommate that plays video games causes the other to most likely participate, which reflected in a half-hour less of studying, also showing GPA's .02 lower than others. When dealing with a college roommate the choice to study or sleep should take precedence over the choice to party or play loud music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nueman|first=Fredrick|title=Getting Along With Roommates|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fighting-fear/201401/getting-along-roommates|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding allows those to choose to focus differently on school to do so without harm to the roommate relationship or grades.

Addressing an Issue:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roommate Conflicts: Confrontation, Communication, Mediation|url=http://www.slc.edu/studentlife/residence-life/roommate-conflicts-confrontation,-communication,-mediation.html|publisher=Sarah Lawrence College|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
The best approach to address an issue with a roommate is an upfront and in person conversation, preferably a one on one conversation. While approaching the issues understand and respect each other's differences. When discussing the issues allow both sides to express their thoughts and feelings on the issue. And after both listening and speaking to each other present a resolution. and in doing so create a win-win situation this allows for the conflict to be more easily resolved. The resolution may not be the personal idea, but it should help the situation to some degree.

'''Row Lewis''' is a [[Grenadian people|Grenadian]] activist, teacher, life coach, vocalist, and liberation theologian. She is the founder of Liberty Fellowship Center, a non-profit ministry, where she serves as the Executive Director and Spiritual Advisor.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
The daughter of a Pentecostal Pastor, Rev. Raymond Lewis of the [[True Vine Church]], Row Lewis is an ordained minister with academic studies in Comparative Religion, World Religion, Psychology, Counseling, and Journalism from the [[University of Florida]] and Hope Theological Seminary. She has enjoyed a career in television broadcasting for over a decade, winning [[Associated Press]] Awards (1998, 2001) for interviews with former [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]], [[William Cohen]], and recording artists, The [[Baha Men]].

Born into a musical family, Row took the stage singing and performing at age 5, but still feels she has more to accomplish:

:''"I have tested the physical constraints of my body from a young age…defying time, space, and circumstance on track fields, [[basketball]] courts, [[martial art]] arenas.  I have pushed and prodded my intellect on [[academic]] as well as home fronts…always seeking…always yearning…always pressing for more…more…and more still.  I am more than well aware of what it's like to achieve and succeed, but now view 'success' in very different constructs...I still have much work to do."''

Row says her focus now is stayed on the human condition.

:''"My message is one of [[liberty|liberation]]...It's my desire to bring healing to all oppressed people.  I want to encourage a higher state of spiritual vibration in this world...and bring us all back to a greater [[connectedness]] to our Creator Source and thus to each other."''

=== Career ===
In 1994 Row started the music group, ''[[Fresh Fire]]'', with her brother (Attorney and Music Producer, Esmond Lewis) and sister (Entrepreneur, Rachel Lewis) serving as lead vocalist.  Her band toured and shared stages with such gospel artists as: [[Kirk Franklin]], [[Yolanda Adams]], Cece Winans, Donnie McClurkin, [[T-Bone]], Hezekiah Walker, and Vicki Winans.  ''Fresh Fire'' recorded two albums, including the acclaimed, ''Summer of '94''.  Fusing [[jazz]], [[Calypso music|calypso]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[reggae]], [[Soul music|soul]] and [[blues]] with inspirational lyrics, the group enjoyed several crossover hits.

In 2003 through 2004, Row took the stage as a solo artist and performer, of original musical and [[spoken word]] pieces, under her "Soul Connection" label.  Currently, Row is working on a new project entitled, "The Poet Speaks", where she takes on the issues of race, class, gender, religion, and social justice.

=== Personal life ===
Row Lewis is originally from the Island of [[Grenada]], born to her [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] mother Yvonne, and her Grenadian/[[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Vincentian]] father, Raymond.  She is the fourth of seven children.  Row currently resides in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].

'''Sterling Professor''' is the highest academic rank at [[Yale University]], awarded to a tenured faculty member considered one of the best in his or her field. It is akin to the rank of [[university professor]] at other universities.

The appointment, made by the [[List of presidents of Yale University|President of Yale University]] and confirmed by the [[Yale Corporation]], can be granted to any Yale faculty member, and up to forty professors can hold the title at the same time.&lt;ref name="Fellman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dockendorf" /&gt; The position was established through a 1918 bequest from [[John William Sterling]], and the first Sterling Professor was appointed in 1920.

==History==
[[File:Johnwilliamsterling.jpg|thumb|200px|right|John W. Sterling, namesake of the title]]
The professorships are named for and funded by a $15-million bequest left by [[John William Sterling|John W. Sterling]], partner in the New York law firm [[Shearman &amp; Sterling]] and an 1864 graduate of [[Yale College]]. In addition to financing the university's largest construction projects throughout the 1920s, including the [[Sterling Memorial Library]] and flagship facilities for many of its professional schools, Sterling stipulated the bequest would allow "to some extent, the foundation of Scholarships, Fellowships or Lectureships, the endowment of new professorships and the establishment of special funds for prizes."&lt;ref name="Dockendorf"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dockendorf |first=Jay |title=The Sterling Professors of Yale: Evolution of a species |date=January 21, 2011 |newspaper=[[Yale Daily News]] |url=http://yaledailynews.com/weekend/2011/01/21/the-sterling-professors-of-yale-evolution-of-a-species/ |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Sterling Bequest to Yale University |journal=Science |volume=48 |number=1230 |date=July 26, 1918 |page=87 |url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-1642065 |accessdate=April 4, 2014|doi=10.1126/science.48.1230.87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterling's trustees eventually left the university more than $5&amp;nbsp;million for this purpose—about $225,000 per chair.&lt;ref name="Fellman"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Fellman |first=Bruce |title=How Sterling Professors Get That Way |magazine=[[Yale Alumni Magazine]] |date=February 1999 |url=http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/99_02/sterling.html |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science1921"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RrNJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=University and Educational News |date=April 22, 1921 |journal=Science |volume=53 |number=1373 |page=387 |accessdate=March 10, 2015 |doi=10.1126/science.53.1373.386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Sterling Professor was chemist [[John Johnston (chemist)|John Johnston]], who was awarded the rank in 1920, and was joined later that year by school administrator Frank E. Spaulding, biochemist [[Lafayette Mendel]], and astronomer [[Ernest William Brown]].&lt;ref name="Fellman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science1921"/&gt; By the mid-1920s, the endowment allowed eighteen Sterling Professors to be appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hicks |first=Frederick C. |title=Review: 'John William Sterling' |date=1930 |series=Faculty Scholarship Series |journal=Yale Law Journal |number=4712 |url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/4712 |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the [[Yale Corporation]] capped the number of simultaneous appointments at 27,&lt;ref name="Fellman" /&gt; but further endowment growth allowed this number to expand to 40 by 2011.&lt;ref name="Dockendorf"/&gt; In addition to currently appointed faculty, a number of former Sterling Professors retain emeritus appointments at the university and continue to teach.&lt;ref name="Dockendorf"/&gt;

The first woman to be named Sterling Professor was cell biologist Marilyn Farquhar, in 1987.&lt;ref name="Fellman"/&gt; After Farquhar left Yale in 1989, Middle English scholar [[Marie Borroff]] and geneticist [[Carolyn Slayman]] were the next women appointed, in 1991.&lt;ref name="Fellman"/&gt; Among the youngest appointees were [[John Farquhar Fulton]], made Sterling Professor of Physiology in 1929 at age 30,{{sfn|Burrow|2002|pp=128}} and later-U.S Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]], appointed in 1932 at the age of 33.{{sfn|Smith|2004|pp=141}} [[Joan Steitz]] and [[Thomas Steitz]], biochemists appointed in 1999 and 2001 respectively, are the only married couple to have both held the appointment.

'''Theodore "Ted" Michael Drange''' (born 1934) is a [[philosopher of religion]] and [[Professor Emeritus]] at [[West Virginia University]], where he taught [[philosophy]] from 1966 to 2001.

==Life==
After graduating from Fort Hamilton High School, he received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Brooklyn College]] in 1955 and a Ph.D. from [[Cornell University]] in 1963, where he moved to after one year of graduate school at Yale.

He taught at Brooklyn College (1960–62), the University of Oregon (1962–65), Idaho State University (1965–66) and West Virginia University, 1966-2001 after becoming a full professor in 1974. Drange retired in 2001 and moved to Ventura, CA.&lt;ref&gt;http://home.earthlink.net/~writetdrange/bio.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Drange's primarily interests, until the early 1980s were in philosophy of language and epistemology, later shifting to philosophy of religion.

Drange's first book, ''Type Crossings'' (The Hague: Mouton &amp; Co., 1966) was a revision of his Ph.D. dissertation under Max Black on the philosophy of language and was published in 1966. His other book was in the philosophy of religion, ''Nonbelief and Evil'' (Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 1998), in 1998. Drange has also written several articles on the philosophy of religion and atheism, particularly for the [[Internet Infidels]] organization. In 1997, he debated Christian apologist [[William Lane Craig]] on the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|YfUfs3PyM4A|Does God Exist?}} University of Illinois, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/resourcedescriptions.html |title=Does God Exist? |website=LeaderU |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drange married his wife Annette in 1959 and had two children, Susan and Michael.

[[File:Tompkins Table 1997 - 2015.jpg|300px|thumb|Chart of Tompkins rankings for the years 1997 to 2016]]

The '''Tompkins Table''' is an annual ranking that lists the [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge]] in order of their undergraduate students' performances in that year's examinations. Two colleges - Darwin and Clare Hall - do not have undergraduate students and therefore do not feature in the list. It was created in 1981 by Peter Tompkins, then a third-year undergraduate [[mathematics]] student at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], who until 2015 compiled it every year exclusively for the newspaper ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Garner |title=First-class arts and humanities students help Trinity to top place in Cambridge league table |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/firstclass-arts-and-humanities-students-help-trinity-to-top-place-in-cambridge-league-table-2315422.html |work= [[The Independent]] |date=18 July 2011 |accessdate=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2016, it has been published by [[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]], a student newspaper of the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.varsity.co.uk/news/10514|title=The Tompkins Table 2016: Christ's has risen|access-date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not an official [[University of Cambridge]] table.  It does not take account of students who are not candidates for Honours degrees, or those who have failed to gain a degree.

==Rankings==

===Current rankings===
Initially, it only included final year exams but since 1997 has covered all exams for which grades are allocated. The table allocates 5 points for a First Class degree, 3 points for an Upper Second (known also as a 2.i), 2 points for a Lower Second (a 2.ii), 1 point for a Third and no points for someone only granted an allowance towards an Ordinary Degree. The scores in each subject are then weighted to a common average, to avoid the bias towards colleges with higher proportions of students entered for subjects which receive higher average grades. The result is expressed as a percentage of the total number of points available. The differences between the highest places on the table are usually very slight. [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]] was the top college in 2018 following seven years in which [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] came top. The rankings are not officially endorsed by the University. Since [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin College]] and [[Clare Hall, Cambridge|Clare Hall]] admit only graduate students, they do not feature in this undergraduate ranking. Some of the mature colleges, including [[St Edmund's College, Cambridge|St. Edmund's College]], [[Hughes Hall, Cambridge|Hughes Hall]], [[Lucy Cavendish College]], and [[Wolfson College, Cambridge|Wolfson College]], tend to perform relatively more poorly in the Tompkins Table, but have significantly more graduate students than undergraduate students, so the results here are not representative of the majority of the student population of each of these colleges.

Most of the colleges fall within a 10% range of one another therefore the table should be taken lightly with regards to determining the academic standing of the colleges.

Below is the table for 2018:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/15936|title=Exclusive: Christ’s and Pembroke victorious over Trinity in Tompkins Table|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar league tables==

===Baxter tables===
Certain [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge]] commission similar tables called Baxter Tables from Martin Baxter who is a financial analyst specialising in [[mathematical modelling]] and who developed the [[Electoral Calculus]] web site. Baxter tables rank colleges' undergraduate students by their year and subject separately and are delivered in July or August.[https://web.archive.org/web/20120112040817/http://timesonline.typepad.com/dons_life/2006/08/the_perils_of_l.html] They are compiled using published Class Lists, which do not include students who are not candidates for Honours degrees, or those who have failed to gain a degree, or those whose names the Council have determined should be withheld from public display.[https://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2004-05/weekly/6000/6.html] They are meant for internal use of Colleges but not the University, being distributed to the Senior Tutors of the Colleges [http://www.varsity.co.uk/comment/718], with the full tables not being published publicly or outside of the Colleges, and some students being unaware of their existence. However, the rankings of Colleges in the Baxter Tables are sometimes referred to by Colleges in publicly available literature,[https://web.archive.org/web/20111007044240/http://www.clarealumni.com/s/845/1col.aspx?sid=845&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=252&amp;cid=2038&amp;ecid=2038&amp;crid=0&amp;calpgid=61&amp;calcid=779] [http://www.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/alumni/news/detail.asp?ItemID=1179] and the methodology used to compile the Baxter Tables is also available. There is also a 'value-added' table, which shows how students' results improve over the course of their years at Cambridge, and is intended to give a measure or indication of the quality of teaching at the different Colleges.[http://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduates/subjects/mathematics/] However, with such small sample sizes, the amount of meaningful information which can be extracted from these tables is questionable.[http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=967654]

===Norrington table===
The corresponding ranking for [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|Oxford colleges]] is the [[Norrington Table]]. Since 1986, when the [[University of Oxford]] adopted split second-class degrees, the Norrington Table has adopted the same method of scoring as the Tompkins Table, but without the weighting attached to individual subject scores.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1735">In China, the term '''"training school"''' or '''"training center"''' can refer to a private company that helps students, typically from 3-12 years old, improve their performance in academic subjects such as English, math, or Chinese. These schools normally operate in the evenings, on weekends, or both. Many hold classes during school recesses. Training schools can range anywhere from a one-room operation with only one teacher to very large corporations with hundreds of thousands of students.  The more well-known national-level training schools include "EF ([[EF English First|English First]]), Giraffe, Aston, Hess, and Best Learning".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hanacore.com/training-schools-vs-primary-schools-china/ Hanacore&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the existence of training schools in China is the "large gap between the demand for and supply of elementary and secondary teachers",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpre.org/images/stories/cpre_pdfs/sixnations_final.pdf The Consortium for Policy Research in Education (CPRE)&lt;/ref&gt; which causes an increase in the value of premium teaching.

The purpose of a training school is to help students achieve higher scores on the tests they will face in their public schools.  There is a strong distinction in China between a training school and one that will explicitly get students ready for an international school or an overseas education.  Training schools focus on memorization and test taking, but schools geared towards child development emphasize games and activities.

A '''varsity match''' is a [[sport|sporting]] fixture between two [[university]] teams, particularly [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/varsity|title=Varsity|accessdate=23 September 2018|work=Oxford Living Dictionary|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scottish Varsity]] [[rugby union|rugby]] match between the [[University of St Andrews]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]] at [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield stadium]] is claimed to be the oldest recurring varsity match in the world, having been played since the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/13214474.World_s_oldest_varsity_match_returns_to_Scotland/|date=19 May 2015|title=World's oldest varsity match returns to Scotland|work=The Herald (Glasgow)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is predated by the [[The University Match (cricket)|University Match in Cricket]] between Oxford and Cambridge, which was first played in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historychannel.com.au/this-day-in-history/oxford-and-cambridge-play-their-first-cricket-match/|publisher=[[The History Channel]]|title=

==Varsity in England==
The country's longest-running series of varsity matches is played between the [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[University of Oxford]], dating back, in addition to the 1827 University Match in Cricket mentioned above, to the first "Boat Race" in 1829&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theboatrace.org/the-basics|title=The Boat Race Basics|publisher=The Boat Race Company Ltd|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first "Varsity Match" (in Rugby Union) in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thevarsitymatch.com/about/|title=About – The Varsity Match|publisher=The Varsity Match|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually for British university sporting events, both of these are shown on broadcast television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00s4wb4|publisher=BBC|title=BBC One – The Boat Race|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourfc.org/NewsItem.aspx?ID=2804|title=varsity match returns TO TRADITIONAL HOME ON THE BBC|date=16 July 2015|accessdate=23 September 2018|publisher=
Oxford University Rugby Football Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many more recent varsity competitions, the Oxford–Cambridge matches stand alone rather than being part of a wider multi-sport varsity competition.

British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' proposed in 2008 that [[University of Bath|Bath]] vs [[University of Loughborough| Loughborough]] was "the real varsity match" on the basis that these were the top two teams (at that time) in [[British Universities Sports Association]] (BUSA) competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/why-bath-vs-loughborough-is-the-real-varsity-match-845128.html|title=Why Bath vs Loughborough is the real varsity match|author=Richard Garner |date= 12 June 2008|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2015, [[British Universities and Colleges Sport]] (BUCS), the successor to BUSA, has organised fixtures between Loughborough and [[Durham University|Durham]] (the top two universities since 2011/12) to occur on the same day, in what has been termed the "BUCS Varsity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=Durham vs Loughborough on Wednesday 25th November is no ordinary day of University sport. It’s been christened a Varsity and it will have all the hallmarks of one – jam packed, competitive and hectic. However, in truth, it will be so much more than that.&lt;br/&gt; Durham and Loughborough have topped the BUCS Points table every year since 2011/12 and it’s for that reason that the day takes on such significance. It will be a celebration of top-level University sport, crucial in the outcome of this year’s Premiership divisions and a veritable feast of sport for enthusiastic spectators.|url=https://www.bucs.org.uk/news.asp?itemid=19181&amp;itemTitle=Durham%27s+%23BUCSWednesday+breakdown&amp;section=8&amp;sectionTitle=News|title=Durham's #BUCSWednesday breakdown|date= 25 November 2015|author=Matt Roberts|publisher=BUCS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.palatinate.org.uk/clash-of-the-titans-–-durham-vs-loughborough-varsity-preview/|title=Clash of the Titans – Durham vs Loughborough Varsity Preview|date=21 November 2015|author=Simon Carey|work=[[Palatinate (newspaper)|Palatinate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of city and regional sporting rivalries exist between universities, which are also dubbed varsity matches. The [[Roses Tournament]] between the universities of [[University of York|York]] and [[University of Lancaster|Lancaster]] is one of the oldest and largest of these, dating back to 1965. It is frequently referred to as the  largest inter-university sports tournament in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/wars-of-the-roses-how-the-rivalry-between-yorkshire-and-lancashire-still-exists-today-1-9170624|work=[[The Yorkshire Post]]|publisher=Johnston Publishing Ltd|title=Wars of the roses: How the rivalry between Yorkshire and Lancashire still exists today|date=18 May 2018|author=Helen Johnson|quote=The sporting rivalry between the two counties has even filtered through to University life, with an annual sporting competition called the ‘Roses Tournament’ existing between University of York and Lancaster University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4657">The '''Worcester County Mathematics League''' ('''WOCOMAL''') is a [[high school]] [[mathematics]] league composed of 32 high schools, most of which are in [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]], [[Massachusetts]].  It organizes seven mathematics competitions per year, four at the "varsity" level (up to grade 12) and three at the "freshman" level (up to grade nine, including [[middle school]] students).  In the 2013-14 school year, WOCOMAL began allowing older students to compete in the freshman level competitions, calling this level of participation "junior varsity."

Top schools from the varsity competition are selected to attend the Massachusetts Association of Math Leagues state competition.

==Contest format==

A competition consists of four, or nine rounds at the Freshman level or five rounds at the Varsity level. The team round consists of eight problems at the Freshman level and nine at the Varsity level.  Regardless of level, each student competes in three of the individual rounds.

In each individual round, competing students have ten minutes to answer three questions, worth one, two, and three points.  The maximum meet score for a student is eighteen points.

==History==
The Worcester County Mathematics League was originally formed in 1963 as the '''Southern Worcester County Mathematics League''' ('''Sowocomal''').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wocomal.org/coaches/bylaws/196768bylaws.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The winningest school in league history is [[St. John's High School (Massachusetts)|St. John's High School]], with twelve league championships in the fourteen-year span between 1983–84 and 1996-97. [[Algonquin Regional High School]] won six consecutive league championships from 1998-99 to 2003-04.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wocomal.org/statistics/varsity/alltime/team/championshipsbyyear.html WOCOMAL All-Time Team Records]&lt;/ref&gt;
