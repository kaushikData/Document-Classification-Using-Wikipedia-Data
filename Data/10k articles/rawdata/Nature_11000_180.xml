[[File:Tajikistan 2008 Winter 1.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Supplies are unloaded from a truck in Tajikistan during the harsh 2007–2008 winter]]The '''2008 Central Asia energy crisis''' was an [[energy shortage]] in [[Central Asia]], which, combined with the severe weather of the 2007-08 [[winter]]  (the coldest since 1969&lt;ref&gt;GHCN Climate data for Tashkent 1880 to 2008&lt;/ref&gt;) and high prices for food and fuel, caused considerable hardship for many.&lt;ref name=EN&gt;{{cite web|author=Farangis Najibullah |date=January 13, 2008 |title=Tajikistan: Energy shortages, extreme cold create crisis situation |work=[[EurasiaNet]] |accessdate=2008-02-08 |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/pp011308.shtml |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mq7fTQ7g?url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/pp011308.shtml |archivedate=January 17, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The abnormally cold weather has pushed demand up for [[electricity]], exacerbating the crisis. The situation was most dire in [[Tajikistan]].  An international appeal was made by the [[United Nations]], [[Nongovernmental organizations|NGOs]], and the [[Red Cross and Red Crescent]] for around [[U.S. dollar|US$]]25&amp;nbsp;million to assist the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110521063044/http://ochaonline.un.org/OchaLinkClick.aspx?link=ocha&amp;docId=1086738 Situation Report No. 4 – Tajikistan – Cold Wave/Compound crisis (25 February 2008)] United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, The UN warned that millions face starvation during the 2008-09 winter.&lt;ref name="eurasianet.org"&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav100708.shtml Tajikistan: Almost One-Third of the Population Is in Danger of Going Hungry This Winter &amp;#124; EurasiaNet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Bank debt and price hikes==

[[File:Tajikistan 2008 Winter 2.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Aid supplies in Tajikistan]]
At the beginning of January 2008, officials announced an electricity price hike of 20 percent to allow the "government [to] repay its debt to the [[World Bank]]."&lt;ref name=EN/&gt; According to an official at [[Barqi Tojik]], a national power company, limits will become stricter, and the price for electricity is expected to rise until 2010.&lt;ref name=EN/&gt;

On April 2008, Pradeep Mitra, World Bank chief economist for Europe and Central Asia, issued an uncharacteristic statement, urging the worse-hit countries to spend more on social assistance and "top up" their social programs.&lt;ref name="unian"&gt;[http://unian.net/eng/news/news-246839.html ], ''[[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency|UNIAN]]'', April 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Mitra focus remained centred "on inflation management," suggesting that the affected countries "especially refrain from imposing controls on trade" (measures recently [[2007–2008 world food price crisis#Effects on developing countries|undertaken by many countries]] to protect their populations from food price inflation and keep food available domestically), arguing that "it could work against the food supply in the longer term."&lt;ref name="unian"/&gt;

==Power shortages==

Starting on January 13, 2008, many villages received only one to three hours of electricity per day, and the capital [[Dushanbe]] cut power to residential areas overnight.&lt;ref name=EN/&gt; On January 26, 2008, Dushanbe cut power to places of entertainment (including [[restaurant]]s, shops, pharmacies, markets, and [[Public bathing|public bathhouses]]), causing many to close until spring. There were only few visible lights in the city which were from the owners of [[Electrical generator|generators]], [[factory|factories]], or people who had illegally tapped the power lines. The restriction was set to end February 10, however it was subsequently extended.&lt;ref name=pullplug&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.iwpr.net/ovPs2m|title= Tajiks Pull the Plug on Cafés|author= Nafisa Pisarejeva|accessdate=2008-02-09|work=[[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]]|date=February 1, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080219071730/http://www.iwpr.net/?p=rca&amp;s=f&amp;o=342388&amp;apc_state=henh| archivedate= 19 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were only few exemptions to the restrictions which included government offices, [[hospital]]s, and certain industrial cities, such as [[Tursunzoda]], which had a large [[aluminum]] plant. Because of inoperable central heating systems in Dushanbe and other cities, residents in apartment blocks had no means other than electricity to heat their homes.&lt;ref name=EN/&gt;

==Harsh winter==

The situation was exacerbated by the cold winter, with temperatures reaching -20 degrees Celsius. Dushanbe residents reported wearing several jackets and overcoats to sleep and all family members sleeping under a single blanket to share warmth.&lt;ref name=EN/&gt; The UN's [[World Food Programme]] also declared the food situation as being in emergency shortage, in both cities and rural areas.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7231528.stm|title=Tajikistan 'facing food crisis'|work=[[BBC News]]|date=February 6, 2008|author=Natalia Antelava|accessdate=2008-02-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080209124108/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7231528.stm| archivedate= 9 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of media suppression==

As of mid-January 2008, the state-run media did not discuss the problem.&lt;ref name=EN/&gt; Subsequently throughout the month of February, there emerged numerous Western media reports of children dying in maternity wards of hospitals during blackouts. The Tajik government maintains that the blackouts were not responsible for any deaths.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web|title=Crisis Looms as Bitter Cold, Blackouts Hit Tajikistan|work=[[National Public Radio]] [[All Things Considered]]|author=Ivan Watson|date=February 8, 2008|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18784716|accessdate=2008-02-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080210054339/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18784716| archivedate= 10 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tajik government has appealed for international aid.&lt;ref name=CARE&gt;{{cite web|title=Severe energy crisis leaves Tajikistan without heat and water|url=http://www.careinternational.org.uk/Severe%20energy%20crisis%20leaves%20Tajikistan%20without%20heat%20and%20water+10700.twl|date=February 7, 2008|work=[[CARE International]]|accessdate=2008-02-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, aid workers and diplomats urged the government to declare a state of emergency.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; The handling of the crisis has raised questions about the competence of the political leadership.&lt;ref name=coldsnap&gt;{{cite web|author=Jyldyz Mamytova and Yaroslav Razumov|date=January 31, 2008|title=Cold Snap Wreaks Havoc on Central Asian Power|accessdate=2008-02-08|work=Institute for War and Peace Reporting|url=http://www.iwpr.net/?p=rca&amp;s=f&amp;o=342358&amp;apc_state=henprca| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080217083948/http://www.iwpr.net/?p=rca&amp;s=f&amp;o=342358&amp;apc_state=henprca| archivedate= 17 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famine warning==

On March 3, 2008 it was reported that the crisis in Tajikistan has eased: "From now on (at least till the next winter) Dushanbe is not going to have problems with electricity and the tough schedule introduced in the beginning of this winter was abandoned on March 1, 2008 in Dushanbe by the decision of Barqi Tojik."&lt;ref name=neweurasia&gt;{{cite web|title=Electricity crisis solved in Dushanbe|work=[[neweurasia]]|author=Vadim|date=March 3, 2008|url=http://tajikistan.neweurasia.net/2008/03/03/electricity-crisis-solved-in-dushanbe/|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202071352/http://tajikistan.neweurasia.net/2008/03/03/electricity-crisis-solved-in-dushanbe/ |archivedate=December 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Christian Science Monitor]], neweurasia, and other media observers predicted that a nascent hunger crisis will erupt into a full [[famine]] as a consequence of the energy shortages, which subsequently happened.&lt;ref name="neweurasia1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hunger to replace energy crisis|work=[[neweurasia]]|author=Vadim|date=March 4, 2008|url=http://tajikistan.neweurasia.net/2008/03/04/hunger-to-replace-energy-crisis/|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090114031922/http://tajikistan.neweurasia.net/2008/03/04/hunger-to-replace-energy-crisis/ |archivedate=January 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN experts announced on 10 October that almost one-third of Tajikistan’s 6.7 million inhabitants did not have enough to eat for the winter of 2008-09.&lt;ref name="eurasianet.org"/&gt;

==Kyrgyzstan==
[[File:Kyrgyz power station.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A power station in Kyrgyzstan]]
In [[Kyrgyzstan]], also rich in hydroelectric resources, the cold weather had made demand 10% higher than in the winter of 2006/2007, which depleted the main [[Toktogul]] reservoir for hydroelectric power.&lt;ref name=coldsnap/&gt;

==Uzbekistan==
Beginning in late December 2007, the unusually harsh weather had frozen the gas supply to numerous homes and businesses across Uzbekistan. As a result, there had been numerous demonstrations and protests against the government, in favor of an insured uninterrupted supply of gas and electricity.&lt;ref name=uzbek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwpr.net/?p=rca&amp;s=f&amp;o=342233&amp;apc_state=henfrca342235|title=Uzbekistan Sees Rare Protests Over Gas Shortage|date=January 25, 2008|accessdate=2008-02-09|work=Institute for War and Peace Reporting}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government response was varied, and in [[Karakalpakstan]], they met protesters and promised to rectify the situation, while the local government head of [[Hazarasp]] responded to a complaint by one woman by cutting off gas altogether to all the houses on her street.&lt;ref name=uzbek/&gt;

Some in Uzbekistan were able to turn to "traditional methods" for heating, and it was reported that some villages which had no [[tree]]s left because villagers have cut them down to heat their homes and cook food. This had an expected negative effect on the economy, because the leaves are essential to the local [[silk]] industry, and the [[fruit]] grown on these trees are the main source of income for many villagers.&lt;ref name=EN/&gt;

==Turkmenistan==
In some provinces of [[Turkmenistan]], villagers were burning [[Haloxylon ammodendron|saxaul]] plants, a traditional [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] way to heat homes, since in the cities, the central heating pipes have been neglected and failed to produce adequate heat.&lt;ref name=EN/&gt;

'''{{mp|2010 AL|30}}''' is a [[near-Earth asteroid]] that was discovered on 10 January 2010.&lt;ref name=jpldata&gt;{{cite web |title=JPL Small-Body Database Browser |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2010AL30;cad=1 |accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian scientists Ernesto Guido and Giovanni Sostero told [[RIA Novosti]] that it had an orbital period of almost exactly one year and might be a spent rocket booster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-01-14/us/28126845_1_object-orbit-amateur-telescope What was that Mystery object whizzes past Earth], The Times of India, January 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it was determined that it is a near-Earth asteroid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news167.html Small Asteroid 2010 AL30 Will Fly Past The Earth]. [[NASA]]/[[JPL]] Near-Earth Object Program, January 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 2010 at 1246 UT it passed Earth at {{convert|0.0008624|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}},&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; about 1/3 of the distance from the Earth to the Moon (or 0.33 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|LD]]).

Based an estimated diameter of {{convert|10|-|15|m|ft|abbr=on}}, if 2010 AL30 had entered the Earth's atmosphere, it would have created an [[air burst]] equivalent to between 50 kT and 100 kT ([[TNT equivalent|kilotons of TNT]]). The Nagasaki "[[Fat Man]]" atom bomb had a yield between 13–18 kT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epod.usra.edu/blog/2010/03/nearearth-object-2010-al30.html Near-Earth Object 2010 AL30]. [[NASA]] Earth Science Picture of the Day March 06, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has an [[Uncertainty Parameter U|uncertainty parameter]] of 2 and has been observed by [[radar astronomy|radar]].&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; Radar observations show the asteroid is elongated and is about 30 meters in diameter.&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt; It may be a [[contact binary (small Solar System body)|contact binary]].

'''''A Field Guide to the Birds of Hawaii and the Tropical Pacific''''' is a 1987 book by [[Harold Douglas Pratt, Jr.]], [[Phillip L. Bruner]] and [[Delwyn G. Berrett]] (with illustrations by Pratt). It is published by [[Princeton University Press]] and is produced as both hardback ({{ISBN|978-0-691-08402-2}}) and softback ({{ISBN|978-0-691-02399-1}}) editions. The book is primarily a [[field guide]] to birds found in the [[Hawaiian islands]], [[Micronesia]], [[Fiji]] and tropical [[Polynesia]] (plus some northern subtropical Polynesian islands), including some distribution and status data. It was the first identification work to cover the birds of the whole of this region.

The book is 190&amp;nbsp;mm high by 128&amp;nbsp;mm wide. It comprises xx + 409 pages, with 45 colour plates (43 of which contain Pratt's illustrations of birds; the remaining two contain photographs of plants important to birds in the region). The main text is divided up into three sections:
* "How to use this book" (pages 3 – 14)
* "A birder's-eye view of the Tropical Pacific" (pages 15 – 44) which contains descriptions of the types of island, their habitats and the bird communities found in them, with some information about bird conservation in the region.
* Individual species accounts, which make up the bulk of the book's text, between pages 45 and 319

Appendix A (pages 321 - 328) contains a [[hypothetical list of biota|hypothetical list]] for the region, and Appendix B (pages 329 - 258) a series of species checklists for the individual subdivisions. A map of the region covered is given on pages xvi - xvii, with more detailed maps of individual parts of the region in Appendix C (pages 359 - 372). These appendices are followed by a [[glossary]], [[bibliography]] and [[Index (publishing)|index]].

A list of extinct species is given on page 36, and a number of these are illustrated in the book's artwork section.

The book is dedicated to Dr. [[Robert J. Newman]].

[[Greek mythology]] describes three floods, the flood of [[Ogyges]], the flood of [[Deucalion]], and the flood of [[Dardanus (son of Zeus)|Dardanus]]. Two of the Greek [[Ages of Man]] concluded with a flood: The Ogygian Deluge ended the [[Silver age|Silver Age]], and the flood of Deucalion ended the [[Greek Heroic Age|First Bronze Age]]. In addition to these floods, Greek mythology says the world was also periodically destroyed by fire. See [[Phaethon|Phaëton]].

| style="text-align: left;" |"Many great deluges have taken place during the nine thousand years, for that is the number of years which have elapsed since the time of which I am speaking; and during all of this time and through so many changes, there has never been any considerable accumulation of the soil coming down from the mountains, as in other places, but the earth has fallen away all round and sunk out of sight. The consequence is, that in comparison of what then was, there are  remaining only the bones of the wasted body, as they may be called, as in the case of small islands, all the  richer and softer parts of the soil having fallen away, and the mere skeleton of the land being left."

The Ogygian flood is so called because it occurred in the time of [[Ogyges]],&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*)wgu%2Fgios Ωγύγιος] at [[Liddell &amp; Scott]]&lt;/ref&gt; a mythical king of [[Attica]]. The name ''"Ogyges"'' and ''"Ogygian"'' is synonymous with "primeval", "primal" and "earliest dawn". Others say he was the founder and king of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]]. In many traditions the Ogygian flood is said to have covered the whole world and was so devastating that Attica remained without kings until the reign of [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodor Gaster|Gaster, Theodor H.]] [http://home.earthlink.net/~misaak/floods.htm#Gaster Myth, Legend, and Custom in the Old Testament] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020204111850/http://home.earthlink.net/~misaak/floods.htm#Gaster |date=2002-02-04 }}, Harper &amp; Row, New York, 1969.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] in his [[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]], Book III,&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Laws, Book III, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0166%3Abook%3D3%3Apage%3D677 677a]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that this flood had occurred 
ten thousand years&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0165%3Abook%3D3%3Apage%3D677 Greek] original text is "''μυριάκις μύρια ἔτη διελάνθανεν''", where [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmuria%2Fs μυριάς] is the myriad or 10,000 (years)&lt;/ref&gt; before his time, as opposed to only "one or two thousand years that have elapsed" since the discovery of music, and other inventions. Also in ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (22)  and in ''[[Critias (Plato)|Critias]]'' (111-112) he describes the "great deluge of all" as having been preceded by 9,000 years of history before the time of his contemporary [[Solon]], during the [[10th millennium BCE]]. In addition, the texts report that "many great deluges have taken place during the nine thousand years" since Athens and [[Atlantis]] were preeminent.&lt;ref&gt;Luce, J.V. (1971), "The End of Atlantis: New Light on an Old Legend" (Harper Collins)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deucalion==
The [[Deucalion]] legend as told by the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' has some similarity to other [[deluge myths]] such as the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] and the story of [[Noah's Ark]]. The [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]] advised his son Deucalion to build a chest. All other men perished except for a few who escaped to high mountains. The mountains in [[Thessaly]] were parted, and all the world beyond the Isthmus and Peloponnese was overwhelmed. Deucalion and his wife [[Pyrrha]], after floating in the chest for nine days and nights, landed on [[Mount Parnassus|Parnassus]].  An older version of the story told by [[Hellanicus of Lesbos|Hellanicus]] has Deucalion's "ark" landing on [[Mount Othrys]] in [[Thessaly]]. Another account has him landing on a peak, probably Phouka, in [[Argolis]], later called [[Nemea]]. When the rains ceased, he sacrificed to [[Zeus]]. Then, at the bidding of Zeus, he threw stones behind him, and they became men, and the stones Pyrrha threw became women. The ''Bibliotheca'' gives this as an [[etymology]] for Greek ''Laos'' "people" as derived from ''laas'' "stone".&lt;ref&gt;
Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dla%3Das λᾶας] at [[Liddell &amp; Scott]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Megarians]] told that Megarus, son of Zeus and a Sithnid nymph, escaped Deucalion's flood by swimming to the top of Mount Gerania, guided by the cries of [[Crane (bird)|cranes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 1. 40. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===From The Theogony of the ''Bibliotheca''===
According to the ''[[Theogony]]'' of the ''Bibliotheca'', Prometheus moulded men out of water and earth and gave them fire which, unknown to Zeus, he had hidden in a stalk of fennel. When Zeus learned of it, he ordered Hephaestus to nail Prometheus to Mount Caucasus, a Scythian mountain. Prometheus was nailed to the mountain and kept bound for many years. Every day an eagle swooped on him and devoured the lobes of his liver, which grew by night. That was the penalty that Prometheus paid for the theft of fire until Heracles afterwards released him.

Prometheus had a son Deucalion. He, reigning in the regions about Phthia, married Pyrrha, the daughter of [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]] and [[Pandora (mythology)|Pandora]], the first woman fashioned by the gods. And when Zeus would destroy the men of the Bronze Age, Deucalion, by the advice of Prometheus, constructed a chest. Having stocked it with provisions, he embarked in it with Pyrrha. Zeus, by pouring heavy rain from heaven, flooded the greater part of Greece, so that all men were destroyed, except a few who fled to the high mountains in the neighbourhood as Peloponnesus was overwhelmed. But Deucalion, floating in the chest over the sea for nine days and as many nights, drifted to Parnassus, and there, when the rain ceased, he landed and made a sacrifice to Zeus, the god of Escape. And Zeus sent Hermes to him and allowed him to choose what he would, and he chose to get men.

At the bidding of Zeus he took up stones and threw them over his head, and the stones Deucalion threw became men, and the stones Pyrrha threw became women. Hence people were called metaphorically people (Laos) from laas, "a stone." And Deucalion had children by Pyrrha, first Hellen, whose father some say was Zeus, and second [[Amphictyon]], who reigned over Attica after [[Cranaus]], and third a daughter Protogonia, who became the mother of [[Aethlius]] by Zeus. Hellen had Dorus, [[Xuthus]], and [[Aeolus (son of Hellen)|Aeolus]] by a nymph Orseis. Those who were called Greeks he named Hellenes after himself, and divided the country among his sons. Xuthus received Peloponnese and begat [[Achaeus (son of Xuthus)|Achaeus]] and [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]] by [[Creusa (daughter of Erechtheus)|Creusa]], daughter of [[Erechtheus]], and from Achaeus and Ion the Achaeans and Ionians derive their names. Dorus received the country over against Peloponnese and called the settlers Dorians after himself.

Aeolus reigned over the regions about Thessaly and named the inhabitants Aeolians. He married [[Enarete]], daughter of [[Deimachus]], and begat seven sons, [[Cretheus]], [[Sisyphus]], [[Athamas]], [[Salmoneus]], Deion, [[Magnes (mythology)|Magnes]], [[Perieres]], and five daughters, [[Canace]], [[Alcyone]], [[Pisidice]], [[Calyce (mythology)|Calyce]], [[Perimede]]. Perimede had [[Hippodamas (Greek mythology)|Hippodamas]] and [[Orestes]] by Achelous; and Pisidice had [[Antiphus]] and Actor by Myrmidon. Alcyone was married by Ceyx, son of Lucifer (?). These perished by reason of their pride, for he said that his wife was Hera, and she said that her husband was Zeus. But Zeus turned them into birds; her he made a kingfisher (alcyon) and him a gannet (ceyx).

==Dardanus==
This one has the same basic story line.
According to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], [[Dardanus (son of Zeus)|Dardanus]] left [[Feneos|Pheneus]] in [[Arcadia]] to colonize a land in the North-East [[Aegean Sea]]. When Dardanus' deluge occurred, the land was flooded and the mountain where he and his family survived formed the island of [[Samothrace]]. He left Samothrace on an inflated skin to the opposite shores of [[Asia Minor]] and settled on [[Mount Ida]]. Due to the fear of another flood, they refrained from building a city and lived in the open for fifty years. His grandson [[Tros (mythology)|Tros]] eventually moved from the highlands down to a large plain, on a hill that had many rivers flowing down from Ida above. There he built a city, which was named [[Troy]] after him.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Laws, Book III, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0166%3Abook%3D3%3Apage%3D682 682a]&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, we call the area "the [[Dardanelles]]" (formerly known as [[Hellespont]]), a narrow strait in northwestern [[Turkey]] that connects the [[Aegean Sea]] to the [[Sea of Marmara]].  The name is derived from [[Dardanus (city)|Dardania]], an ancient land on the Asian shore of the strait which in turn takes its name from [[Dardanus (son of Zeus)|Dardanus]], the mythical son of [[Zeus]] and [[Electra (Pleiad)|Electra]].

{{Infobox atom}}

An '''atom''' is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary [[matter]] that has the properties of a [[chemical element]]. Every [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] is composed of neutral or [[ionized]] atoms. Atoms are extremely small; typical sizes are around 100&amp;nbsp;[[picometer]]s (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the [[short scale]]).

Atoms [[Matter wave#The de Broglie hypothesis|are small enough]] that attempting to predict their behavior using classical physics – as if they were [[billiard ball]]s, for example – gives noticeably incorrect predictions due to [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]]. Through the development of physics, atomic models have incorporated [[#Further developments in quantum physics|quantum principles]] to better explain and predict this behavior.

Every atom is composed of a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] and one or more [[electron]]s bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made of one or more [[proton]]s and typically a similar number of [[neutron]]s. Protons and neutrons are called [[nucleon]]s. More than 99.94% of an atom's [[mass]] is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive [[electric charge]], the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively, and it is called an [[ion]].

The electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by this [[electromagnetic force]]. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by a different force, the [[nuclear force]], which is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force repelling the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force, and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus, leaving behind a different element: [[nuclear decay]] resulting in [[nuclear transmutation]].

The number of protons in the nucleus defines to what [[chemical element]] the atom belongs: for example, all [[copper]] atoms contain 29 protons. The number of neutrons defines the [[isotope]] of the element. The number of electrons influences the [[magnetic]] properties of an atom. Atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by [[chemical bond]]s to form [[chemical compound]]s such as [[molecule]]s. The ability of atoms to associate and dissociate is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature and is the subject of the discipline of [[chemistry]].

==History of atomic theory==
{{Main|Atomic theory}}

===Atoms in philosophy===
{{Main|Atomism}}
The idea that matter is made up of discrete units is a very old idea, appearing in many ancient cultures such as Greece and India. The word "atom" ({{lang-grc-gre|[[:wikt:ἄτομος|ἄτομος]]}}; ''{{lang|grc-Latn|atomos}}''), meaning "uncuttable", was coined by the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]] [[Leucippus]] and his pupil [[Democritus]] ({{circa}} 460 – {{circa}} 370 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pullman|first1=Bernard|title=The Atom in the History of Human Thought|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-19-515040-7|pages=31–33|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IQs5hur-BpgC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=Leucippus+Democritus+atom#v=onepage&amp;q=Leucippus%20Democritus%20atom&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kenny2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenny|first=Anthony|authorlink=Anthony Kenny|date=2004|title=Ancient Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cpYUDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Anthony+Kenny+Ancient+Philosophy#v=onepage&amp;q=Democritus&amp;f=false|series=A New History of Western Philosophy|volume=1|location=Oxford, England|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-875273-8|pages=26–28|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GraftonMostSettis2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pyle|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Pyle (philosopher)|date=2010|chapter=Atoms and Atomism|title=The Classical Tradition|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbqF8z2bq3sC&amp;q=Epicurus#v=snippet&amp;q=Atoms&amp;f=false|editor1-last=Grafton|editor1-first=Anthony|editor1-link=Anthony Grafton|editor2-last=Most|editor2-first=Glenn W.|editor2-link=Glenn W.

In the fourteenth century, the rediscovery of major works describing atomist teachings, including [[Lucretius]]'s ''[[De rerum natura]]'' and [[Diogenes Laërtius]]'s ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', led to increased scholarly attention on the subject.&lt;ref name="GraftonMostSettis2010"/&gt; Nonetheless, because atomism was associated with the philosophy of [[Epicureanism]], which contradicted orthodox Christian teachings, belief in atoms was not considered acceptable.&lt;ref name="GraftonMostSettis2010"/&gt; The French Catholic priest [[Pierre Gassendi]] (1592–1655) revived Epicurean atomism with modifications, arguing that atoms were created by God and, though extremely numerous, are not infinite.&lt;ref name="GraftonMostSettis2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CohenLefebvre2017"/&gt; Gassendi's modified theory of atoms was popularized in France by the physician [[François Bernier]] (1620–1688) and in England by the natural philosopher [[Walter Charleton]] (1619–1707).&lt;ref name="GraftonMostSettis2010"/&gt; The chemist [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691) and the physicist [[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727) both defended atomism and, by the end of the seventeenth century, it had become accepted by portions of the scientific community.&lt;ref name="GraftonMostSettis2010"/&gt;

===First evidence-based theory===
[[File:Daltons symbols.gif|right|thumb|Various atoms and molecules as depicted in [[John Dalton]]'s ''A New System of Chemical Philosophy'' (1808).]]
In the early 1800s, [[John Dalton]] used the concept of atoms to explain why [[Chemical element|elements]] always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the [[law of multiple proportions]]). For instance, there are two types of [[tin oxide (disambiguation)|tin oxide]]: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen ([[tin(II) oxide]] and [[tin dioxide]] respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in multiples of discrete units — in other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.&lt;ref name="From AtomosToAtom"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew G. van Melsen |year=1952 |title=From Atomos to Atom |isbn= 978-0-486-49584-2 |publisher=Dover Publications |location=Mineola, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalton also believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, he found that water absorbs [[carbon dioxide]] far better than it absorbs [[nitrogen]].&lt;ref name = "Dalton_1803_paper"&gt;Dalton, John. "[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~GIUNTA/dalton52.html On the Absorption of Gases by Water and Other Liquids]", in ''Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester''. 1803. Retrieved on August 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Dalton hypothesized this was due to the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases' respective particles, and carbon dioxide molecules (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Brownian motion===
In 1827, [[Botany|botanist]] [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]] used a microscope to look at dust grains floating in water and discovered that they moved about erratically, a phenomenon that became known as "[[Brownian motion]]". This was thought to be caused by water molecules knocking the grains about. In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] proved the reality of these molecules and their motions by producing the first [[statistical physics]] analysis of [[Brownian motion]].&lt;ref name=adp322_8_549/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|oclc=48753074|pages=1–7}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lee_hoon1995/&gt; French physicist [[Jean Perrin]] used Einstein's work to experimentally determine the mass and dimensions of atoms, thereby conclusively verifying [[Dalton's atomic theory]].&lt;ref name=e31_2_50/&gt;

===Discovery of the electron===
[[File:Gold foil experiment conclusions.svg|thumb|right|The '''[[Geiger–Marsden experiment]]'''&lt;br /&gt; ''Top:'' Expected results: alpha particles passing through the plum pudding model of the atom with negligible deflection.&lt;br /&gt; ''Bottom:'' Observed results: a small portion of the particles were deflected by the concentrated positive charge of the nucleus.]]
The physicist [[J.J. Thomson]] measured the mass of [[cathode ray]]s, showing they were made of particles, but were around 1800 times lighter than the lightest atom, [[hydrogen]]. Therefore, they were not atoms, but a new particle, the first ''[[subatomic particle|subatomic]]'' particle to be discovered, which he originally called "''[[wikt:corpuscle|corpuscle]]''" but was later named ''electron'', after particles postulated by [[George Johnstone Stoney]] in 1874. He also showed they were identical to particles given off by [[Photoelectric effect|photoelectric]] and radioactive materials.&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=J.J.|title=On bodies smaller than atoms|journal=The Popular Science Monthly|volume=|issue= |pages=323–335|date=August 1901|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3CMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA323|doi= |id= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was quickly recognized that they are the particles that carry [[electric current]]s in metal wires, and carry the negative electric charge within atoms. Thomson was given the 1906 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this work. Thus he overturned the belief that atoms are the indivisible, ultimate particles of matter.&lt;ref name=nobel1096/&gt; Thomson also incorrectly postulated that the low mass, negatively charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom in a uniform sea of positive charge. This became known as the [[plum pudding model]].

===Discovery of the nucleus===
{{main|Geiger-Marsden experiment}}
In 1909, [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]], under the direction of [[Ernest Rutherford]], bombarded a metal foil with [[alpha particle]]s to observe how they scattered. They expected all the alpha particles to pass straight through with little deflection, because Thomson's model said that the charges in the atom are so diffuse that their electric fields could not affect the alpha particles much. However, Geiger and Marsden spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90°, which was supposed to be impossible according to Thomson's model. To explain this, Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the center of the atom.&lt;ref name=pm21_669/&gt;

===Discovery of isotopes===
While experimenting with the products of [[radioactive decay]], in 1913 [[radiochemistry|radiochemist]] [[Frederick Soddy]] discovered that there appeared to be more than one type of atom at each position on the [[periodic table]].&lt;ref name=npc1921/&gt; The term [[isotope]] was coined by [[Margaret Todd (doctor)|Margaret Todd]] as a suitable name for different atoms that belong to the same element. J.J. Thomson created a technique for [[isotope separation]] through his work on [[ionized gas]]es, which subsequently led to the discovery of [[stable isotope]]s.&lt;ref name=prsA_89_1_1913/&gt;

===Bohr model===
[[File:Bohr atom animation 2.gif|right|thumb|The Bohr model of the atom, with an electron making instantaneous "quantum leaps" from one orbit to another. This model is obsolete.]]
{{main|Bohr model}}

In 1913 the physicist [[Niels Bohr]] proposed a model in which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only do so in a finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon.&lt;ref name=stern20050516/&gt; This quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see ''[[synchrotron radiation]]'') and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.&lt;ref name=bohr19221211/&gt;

Later in the same year [[Henry Moseley]] provided additional experimental evidence in favor of [[Bohr model|Niels Bohr's theory]]. These results refined [[Ernest Rutherford]]'s and [[Antonius Van den Broek]]'s model, which proposed that the atom contains in its [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] a number of positive [[nuclear charge]]s that is equal to its (atomic) number in the periodic table. Until these experiments, [[atomic number]] was not known to be a physical and experimental quantity. That it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model today.&lt;ref name="Pais"&gt;{{Cite book

===Chemical bonding explained===
[[Chemical bond]]s between atoms were now explained, by [[Gilbert Newton Lewis]] in 1916, as the interactions between their constituent electrons.&lt;ref name=jacs38_4_762/&gt; As the [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the [[periodic law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of [[electron shell]]s about the nucleus.&lt;ref name=jacs41_6_868/&gt;

===Further developments in quantum physics===
The [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]] of 1922 provided further evidence of the quantum nature of atomic properties. When a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split in a way correlated with the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or [[spin (physics)|spin]]. As this spin direction is initially random, the beam would be expected to deflect in a random direction. Instead, the beam was split into two directional components, corresponding to the atomic [[spin (physics)|spin]] being oriented up or down with respect to the magnetic field.&lt;ref name=fop17_6_575/&gt;

In 1925 [[Werner Heisenberg]] published the first consistent mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics ([[Matrix Mechanics]]).&lt;ref name="Pais"/&gt; One year earlier, in 1924, [[Louis de Broglie]] had proposed that all particles behave to an extent like waves and, in 1926, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] used this idea to develop a mathematical model of the atom (Wave Mechanics) that described the electrons as three-dimensional [[waveform]]s rather than point particles.

A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the [[Point (geometry)|position]] and [[momentum]] of a particle at a given point in time; this became known as the [[uncertainty principle]], formulated by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in 1927.&lt;ref name="Pais"/&gt; In this concept, for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chad Orzel|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQKELOE9eY4|title=What is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle? |website=TED-Ed|date=16 September 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This model was able to explain observations of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as certain structural and [[Spectral line|spectral]] patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen. Thus, the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described [[atomic orbital]] zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be observed.&lt;ref name=brown2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=harrison2000/&gt;

===Discovery of the neutron===
The development of the [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy. The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions, and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge. The chemist [[Francis William Aston]] used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses. The [[atomic mass]] of these isotopes varied by integer amounts, called the [[whole number rule]].&lt;ref name=pm39_6_449/&gt; The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the [[neutron]], an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the [[proton]], by the physicist [[James Chadwick]] in 1932. Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus.&lt;ref name=chadwick1935/&gt;

===Fission, high-energy physics and condensed matter===
In 1938, the German chemist [[Otto Hahn]], a student of Rutherford, directed neutrons onto uranium atoms expecting to get [[transuranium element]]s. Instead, his chemical experiments showed [[barium]] as a product.&lt;ref name=Bowden/&gt;&lt;ref name=CHF/&gt; A year later, [[Lise Meitner]] and her nephew [[Otto Frisch]] verified that Hahn's result were the first experimental ''nuclear fission''.&lt;ref name=nature143_3615_239/&gt;&lt;ref name=schroeder/&gt; In 1944, Hahn received the [[Nobel prize]] in chemistry. Despite Hahn's efforts, the contributions of Meitner and Frisch were not recognized.&lt;ref name=pt50_9_26/&gt;

In the 1950s, the development of improved [[particle accelerator]]s and [[particle detector]]s allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies.&lt;ref name=kullander2001/&gt; Neutrons and protons were found to be [[hadron]]s, or composites of smaller particles called [[quark]]s. The [[standard model of particle physics]] was developed that so far has successfully explained the properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub-atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions.&lt;ref name=npp1990/&gt;

==Structure==
===Subatomic particles===
{{Main|Subatomic particle}}
Though the word ''atom'' originally denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom is composed of various [[subatomic particle]]s. The constituent particles of an atom are the [[electron]], the [[proton]] and the [[neutron]]; all three are [[fermion]]s. However, the [[hydrogen|hydrogen-1]] atom has no neutrons and the [[hydron (chemistry)|hydron ion]] has no electrons.

The electron is by far the least massive of these particles at {{val|9.11|e=-31|u=kg}}, with a negative [[Electric charge|electrical charge]] and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Demtröder|first=Wolfgang|year=2002|title=Atoms, Molecules and Photons: An Introduction to Atomic- Molecular- and Quantum Physics|publisher=Springer|edition=1st|isbn=978-3-540-20631-6|oclc=181435713|pages=39–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured, until the discovery of [[neutrino]] mass. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an [[ion]]. Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to [[J.J. Thomson]]; see [[history of subatomic physics]] for details.

Protons have a positive charge and a mass 1,836 times that of the electron, at {{val|1.6726|e=-27|u=kg}}. The number of protons in an atom is called its [[atomic number]]. [[Ernest Rutherford]] (1919) observed that nitrogen under alpha-particle bombardment ejects what appeared to be hydrogen nuclei. By 1920 he had accepted that the hydrogen nucleus is a distinct particle within the atom and named it [[proton]].

Neutrons have no electrical charge and have a free mass of 1,839 times the mass of the electron,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woan|first=Graham|year=2000|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Physics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57507-2|oclc=224032426|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{val|1.6929|e=-27|u=kg}}, the heaviest of the three constituent particles, but it can be reduced by the [[nuclear binding energy]]. Neutrons and protons (collectively known as [[nucleon]]s) have comparable dimensions—on the order of {{val|2.5|e=-15|u=m}}—although the 'surface' of these particles is not sharply defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacGregor|first=Malcolm H.|year=1992|title=The Enigmatic Electron|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-521833-6|oclc=223372888|pages=33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neutron was discovered in 1932 by the English physicist [[James Chadwick]].

In the [[Standard Model]] of physics, electrons are truly elementary particles with no internal structure. However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of [[elementary particle]]s called [[quark]]s. There are two types of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two [[up quark]]s (each with charge +{{sfrac|2|3}}) and one [[down quark]] (with a charge of −{{sfrac|1|3}}). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.&lt;ref name=pdg2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=schombert2006/&gt;

The quarks are held together by the [[strong interaction]] (or strong force), which is mediated by [[gluon]]s. The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held to each other in the nucleus by the [[nuclear force]], which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more). The gluon is a member of the family of [[gauge boson]]s, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.&lt;ref name=pdg2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=schombert2006/&gt;

===Nucleus===
{{Main|Atomic nucleus}}
[[File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg|thumb|The [[binding energy]] needed for a nucleon to escape the nucleus, for various isotopes]]&lt;!-- A brief explanation is provided here because 'binding energy' is not explained until the end of the section. --&gt;

All the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny [[atomic nucleus]], and are collectively called [[nucleon]]s. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07&amp;nbsp;{{radic|''A''|3}}&amp;nbsp;[[femtometre|fm]], where ''A'' is the total number of nucleons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jevremovic|first=Tatjana|year=2005|title=Nuclear Principles in Engineering|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-23284-3|oclc=228384008|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the [[residual strong force]]. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the [[electrostatic force]] that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pfeffer|first=Jeremy I.|last2=Nir|first2=Shlomo|year=2000|title=Modern Physics: An Introductory Text|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=978-1-86094-250-1|oclc=45900880|pages=330–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atoms of the same [[chemical element|element]] have the same number of protons, called the [[atomic number]]. Within a single element, the number of neutrons may vary, determining the [[isotope]] of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons determine the [[nuclide]]. The number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing [[radioactive decay]].&lt;ref name=wenner2007/&gt;

The proton, the electron, and the neutron are classified as [[fermion]]s. Fermions obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] which prohibits ''[[identical particles|identical]]'' fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state at the same time. Thus, every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum state different from all other protons, and the same applies to all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud.&lt;ref name="raymond"/&gt;

A nucleus that has a different number of protons than neutrons can potentially drop to a lower energy state through a radioactive decay that causes the number of protons and neutrons to more closely match. As a result, atoms with matching numbers of protons and neutrons are more stable against decay. However, with increasing atomic number, the mutual repulsion of the protons requires an increasing proportion of neutrons to maintain the stability of the nucleus, which slightly modifies this trend of equal numbers of protons to neutrons.&lt;ref name="raymond"/&gt;

[[File:Wpdms physics proton proton chain 1.svg|right|thumb|upright|Illustration of a nuclear fusion process that forms a deuterium nucleus, consisting of a proton and a neutron, from two protons. A [[positron]] (e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)—an [[antimatter]] electron—is emitted along with an electron [[neutrino]].]]

The number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies because of the strong force. [[Nuclear fusion]] occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, at the core of the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the [[coulomb barrier]]—and fuse together into a single nucleus.&lt;ref name=mihos2002/&gt; [[Nuclear fission]] is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.&lt;ref name=lbnl20070330/&gt;&lt;ref name=makhijani_saleska2001/&gt;

If the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a [[gamma ray]], or the kinetic energy of a [[beta particle]]), as described by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[mass–energy equivalence]] formula, ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''m'' is the mass loss and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. This deficit is part of the [[binding energy]] of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shultis|first1=J. Kenneth|last2=Faw|first2=Richard E.|title=Fundamentals of Nuclear Science and Engineering|year=2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-0834-4|oclc=123346507|pages=10–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than [[iron]] and [[nickel]]—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an [[exothermic reaction|exothermic process]] that releases more energy than is required to bring them together.&lt;ref name=ajp63_7_653/&gt; It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in [[star]]s a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per [[nucleon]] in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and [[atomic mass]]es higher than about 60, is an [[endothermic reaction|endothermic process]]. These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] of a star.&lt;ref name="raymond"/&gt;

===Electron cloud===
{{Main|Atomic orbital|Electron configuration}}

[[File:Potential energy well.svg|right|thumb|A potential well, showing, according to [[classical mechanics]], the minimum energy ''V''(''x'') needed to reach each position ''x''. Classically, a particle with energy ''E'' is constrained to a range of positions between ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
The electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the [[electromagnetic force]]. This force binds the electrons inside an [[electrostatic]] [[potential well]] surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.

Electrons, like other particles, have properties of both a [[Wave–particle duality|particle and a wave]]. The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional [[standing wave]]—a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus. This behavior is defined by an [[atomic orbital]], a mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears to be at a particular location when its position is measured.&lt;ref name=science157_3784_13/&gt; Only a discrete (or [[wikt:quantize|quantized]]) set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form.&lt;ref name=Brucat2008/&gt; Orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures, and differ from each other in size, shape and orientation.&lt;ref name=manthey2001/&gt;

[[File:S-p-Orbitals.svg|left|thumb|Wave functions of the first five atomic orbitals. The three 2p orbitals each display a single angular [[Node (physics)|node]] that has an orientation and a minimum at the center.]]
[[File:Atomic orbitals and periodic table construction.ogv|left|thumb|How atoms are constructed from electron orbitals and link to the periodic table.]]

Each atomic orbital corresponds to a particular [[energy level]] of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a [[photon]] with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through [[spontaneous emission]], an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states, are responsible for [[atomic spectral line]]s.&lt;ref name=Brucat2008/&gt;

The amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron—the [[electron binding energy]]—is far less than the [[binding energy|binding energy of nucleons]]. For example, it requires only 13.6&amp;nbsp;eV to strip a [[Stationary state|ground-state]] electron from a hydrogen atom,&lt;ref name=herter_8/&gt; compared to 2.23&amp;nbsp;''million'' eV for splitting a [[deuterium]] nucleus.&lt;ref name=pr79_2_282/&gt; Atoms are [[electric charge|electrically]] neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called [[ion]]s. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism, atoms are able to [[chemical bond|bond]] into [[molecule]]s and other types of [[chemical compound]]s like [[Ionic crystal|ionic]] and [[Covalent bond|covalent]] network [[Crystallization|crystals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smirnov|first=Boris M.|year=2003|title=Physics of Atoms and Ions|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-95550-6|pages=249–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
===Nuclear properties===
{{Main|Isotope|Stable isotope|List of nuclides|List of elements by stability of isotopes}}

By definition, any two atoms with an identical number of ''protons'' in their nuclei belong to the same [[chemical element]]. Atoms with equal numbers of protons but a different number of ''neutrons'' are different isotopes of the same element. For example, all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton, but isotopes exist with no neutrons ([[hydrogen-1]], by far the most common form,&lt;ref name=matis2000/&gt; also called protium), one neutron ([[deuterium]]), two neutrons ([[tritium]]) and [[isotopes of hydrogen|more than two neutrons]]. The known elements form a set of atomic numbers, from the single proton element [[hydrogen]] up to the 118-proton element [[oganesson]].&lt;ref name=weiss20061017/&gt; All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive, although the radioactivity of element 83 ([[bismuth]]) is so slight as to be practically negligible.&lt;ref name=s131&gt;{{cite book|last=Sills|first=Alan D.|year=2003|title=Earth Science the Easy Way|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|isbn=978-0-7641-2146-3|oclc=51543743|pages=131–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dume20030423/&gt;

About 339 nuclides occur naturally on [[Earth]],&lt;ref name=lidsay20000730/&gt; of which 254 (about 75%) have not been observed to decay, and are referred to as "[[stable isotope]]s". However, only 90 of these nuclides are stable to all decay, even [[list of nuclides|in theory]]. Another 164 (bringing the total to 254) have not been observed to decay, even though in theory it is energetically possible. These are also formally classified as "stable". An additional 34 radioactive nuclides have half-lives longer than 80 million years, and are long-lived enough to be present from the birth of the [[solar system]]. This collection of 288 nuclides are known as [[primordial nuclide]]s. Finally, an additional 51 short-lived nuclides are known to occur naturally, as daughter products of primordial nuclide decay (such as [[radium]] from [[uranium]]), or else as products of natural energetic processes on Earth, such as cosmic ray bombardment (for example, carbon-14).&lt;ref name=tuli2005/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;For more recent updates see [http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart Interactive Chart of Nuclides (Brookhaven National Laboratory)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- See article [[list of nuclides]]. The numbers are derived by [[WP:CALC]] (counting the table), which is not [[WP:OR]]--&gt;

For 80 of the chemical elements, at least one [[stable isotope]] exists. As a rule, there is only a handful of stable isotopes for each of these elements, the average being 3.2 stable isotopes per element. Twenty-six elements have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element [[tin]]. Elements [[technetium|43]], [[promethium|61]], and all elements numbered [[bismuth|83]] or higher have no stable isotopes.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;CRC Handbook (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}

Stability of isotopes is affected by the ratio of protons to neutrons, and also by the presence of certain "magic numbers" of neutrons or protons that represent closed and filled quantum shells. These quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the [[Nuclear shell model|shell model]] of the nucleus; filled shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual stability on the nuclide. Of the 254 known stable nuclides, only four have both an odd number of protons ''and'' odd number of neutrons: [[hydrogen-2]] ([[deuterium]]), [[lithium-6]], [[boron-10]] and [[nitrogen-14]]. Also, only four naturally occurring, radioactive odd–odd nuclides have a half-life over a billion years: [[potassium-40]], [[vanadium-50]], [[lanthanum-138]] and [[tantalum-180m]]. Most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to [[beta decay]], because the decay products are even–even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to [[Semi-empirical mass formula#Pairing term|nuclear pairing effects]].&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}

===Mass===
{{Main|Atomic mass|mass number}}

The large majority of an atom's mass comes from the protons and neutrons that make it up. The total number of these particles (called "nucleons") in a given atom is called the [[mass number]]. It is a positive integer and dimensionless (instead of having dimension of mass), because it expresses a count. An example of use of a mass number is "carbon-12," which has 12 nucleons (six protons and six neutrons).

The actual [[Invariant mass|mass of an atom at rest]] is often expressed using the [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass unit]] (u), also called dalton (Da). This unit is defined as a twelfth of the mass of a free neutral atom of [[carbon-12]], which is approximately {{val|1.66|e=-27|u=kg}}.&lt;ref name=iupac/&gt; [[hydrogen atom|Hydrogen-1]] (the lightest isotope of hydrogen which is also the nuclide with the lowest mass) has an atomic weight of 1.007825&amp;nbsp;u.&lt;ref name=chieh2001/&gt; The value of this number is called the [[atomic mass]]. A given atom has an atomic mass approximately equal (within 1%) to its mass number times the atomic mass unit (for example the mass of a nitrogen-14 is roughly 14&amp;nbsp;u). However, this number will not be exactly an integer except in the case of carbon-12 (see below).&lt;ref name=nist_wc/&gt; The heaviest [[stable atom]] is lead-208,&lt;ref name=s131/&gt; with a mass of {{val|207.9766521|u=u}}.&lt;ref name=audi2003/&gt;

As even the most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly, chemists instead use the unit of [[Mole (unit)|moles]]. One mole of atoms of any element always has the same number of atoms (about [[Avogadro constant|{{val|6.022|e=23}}]]). This number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of 1&amp;nbsp;u, a mole of atoms of that element has a mass close to one gram. Because of the definition of the [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass unit]], each carbon-12 atom has an atomic mass of exactly 12&amp;nbsp;u, and so a mole of carbon-12 atoms weighs exactly 0.012&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name=iupac&gt;{{cite book

===Shape and size===
{{Main|Atomic radius}}
Atoms lack a well-defined outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually described in terms of an [[atomic radius]]. This is a measure of the distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus.&lt;ref name=Ghosh02&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ghosh, D.C. |author2= Biswas, R. | title = Theoretical calculation of Absolute Radii of Atoms and Ions.

Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a [[chemical bond]].

When subjected to external forces, like [[electrical field]]s, the shape of an atom may deviate from [[spherical symmetry]]. The deformation depends on the field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons, as shown by [[group theory|group-theoretical]] considerations. Aspherical deviations might be elicited for instance in [[crystal]]s, where large crystal-electrical fields may occur at [[crystal symmetry|low-symmetry]] lattice sites.&lt;ref name= Bethe1929&gt;{{cite journal|author = Bethe, Hans|title = Termaufspaltung in Kristallen|journal = Annalen der Physik|volume = 3|issue = 2|pages = 133–208|year = 1929|doi = 10.1002/andp.19293950202|bibcode = 1929AnP...395..133B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= ZPB1995a&gt;{{cite journal | author = Birkholz, Mario | title = Crystal-field induced dipoles in heteropolar crystals – I. concept | journal = Z.

Atomic dimensions are thousands of times smaller than the wavelengths of [[light]] (400–700&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]]) so they cannot be viewed using an [[optical microscope]].

===Radioactive decay===
{{Main|Radioactive decay}}

[[File:Isotopes and half-life.svg|right|thumb|This diagram shows the [[half-life]] (T&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt;) of various isotopes with Z protons and N neutrons.]]

Every element has one or more isotopes that have unstable nuclei that are subject to radioactive decay, causing the nucleus to emit particles or electromagnetic radiation. Radioactivity can occur when the radius of a nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force, which only acts over distances on the order of 1&amp;nbsp;fm.&lt;ref name=splung/&gt;

The most common forms of radioactive decay are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* [[Alpha decay]]: this process is caused when the nucleus emits an alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons. The result of the emission is a new element with a lower [[atomic number]].
* [[Beta decay]] (and [[electron capture]]): these processes are regulated by the [[weak force]], and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an [[antineutrino]], while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a [[positron]] and a [[neutrino]]. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.
* [[Gamma decay]]: this process results from a change in the energy level of the nucleus to a lower state, resulting in the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The excited state of a nucleus which results in gamma emission usually occurs following the emission of an alpha or a beta particle. Thus, gamma decay usually follows alpha or beta decay.

Other more rare types of [[radioactive decay]] include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of [[nucleon]]s from a nucleus, or more than one [[beta particle]]. An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is [[internal conversion]]—a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous [[nuclear fission]].

Each [[radioactive isotope]] has a characteristic decay time period—the [[half-life]]—that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an [[exponential decay]] process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth.&lt;ref name=splung/&gt;

===Magnetic moment===
{{Main|Electron magnetic moment|Nuclear magnetic moment}}

Elementary particles possess an intrinsic quantum mechanical property known as [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. This is analogous to the [[angular momentum]] of an object that is spinning around its [[center of mass]], although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point-like and cannot be said to be rotating. Spin is measured in units of the reduced [[Planck constant]] (ħ), with electrons, protons and neutrons all having spin ½&amp;nbsp;ħ, or "spin-½". In an atom, electrons in motion around the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] possess orbital [[angular momentum]] in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin.&lt;ref name=hornak2006/&gt;

The [[magnetic field]] produced by an atom—its [[magnetic moment]]—is determined by these various forms of angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a magnetic field. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due to the nature of electrons to obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], in which no two electrons may be found in the same [[quantum state]], bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.&lt;ref name=schroeder2/&gt;

In [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] elements such as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an [[exchange interaction]]. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. [[Paramagnetism|Paramagnetic materials]] have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the presence of a field.&lt;ref name=schroeder2/&gt;&lt;ref name=goebel20070901/&gt;

The nucleus of an atom will have no spin when it has even numbers of both neutrons and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, for certain elements (such as [[xenon|xenon-129]]) it is possible to [[spin polarization|polarize]] a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction—a condition called [[hyperpolarization (physics)|hyperpolarization]]. This has important applications in [[magnetic resonance imaging]].&lt;ref name=yarris1997/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Energy levels===
[[Image:Atomic orbital energy levels.svg|thumb|right|These electron's energy levels (not to scale) are sufficient for ground states of atoms up to [[cadmium]] (5s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 4d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) inclusively. Do not forget that even the top of the diagram is lower than an unbound electron state.]]
The [[potential energy]] of an electron in an atom is [[negative number|negative]], its dependence of its [[position (vector)|position]] reaches the [[minimum]] (the most [[absolute value]]) inside the nucleus, and vanishes when the [[distance]] from the nucleus [[limit at infinity|goes to infinity]], roughly in an [[inverse proportion]] to the distance. In the quantum-mechanical model, a bound electron can only occupy a set of [[quantum state|states]] centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific [[energy level]]; see [[time-independent Schrödinger equation]] for theoretical explanation. An energy level can be measured by the [[ionization potential|amount of energy needed to unbind]] the electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of [[electronvolt]]s (eV). The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state, i.e. [[stationary state]], while an electron transition to a higher level results in an excited state.&lt;ref name=zeghbroeck1998/&gt; The electron's energy raises when ''[[principal quantum number|n]]'' increases because the (average) distance to the nucleus increases. Dependence of the energy on [[azimuthal quantum number|{{ell}}]] is caused not by [[electrostatic potential]] of the nucleus, but by interaction between electrons.

For an electron to [[atomic electron transition|transition between two different states]], e.g. grounded state to first excited level ([[ionization]]), it must absorb or emit a [[photon]] at an energy matching the difference in the potential energy of those levels, according to [[Niels Bohr]] model, what can be precisely calculated by the [[Schrödinger equation]].
Electrons jump between orbitals in a particle-like fashion. For example, if a single photon strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon; see [[Atomic orbital|Electron properties]].

The energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its [[frequency]], so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Each element has a characteristic spectrum that can depend on the nuclear charge, subshells filled by electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors.&lt;ref name=martin2007/&gt;

[[File:Fraunhofer lines.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|An example of absorption lines in a spectrum]]

When a continuous [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum of energy]] is passed through a gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark [[absorption band]]s in the energy output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of [[emission line]]s from the photons emitted by the atoms.) [[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] measurements of the strength and width of [[atomic spectral line]]s allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.&lt;ref name=avogadro/&gt;

Close examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a [[fine structure]] splitting. This occurs because of [[spin–orbit coupling]], which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron.&lt;ref name=fitzpatrick20070216/&gt; When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the [[Zeeman effect]]. This is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple [[electron configuration]]s with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines.&lt;ref name=weiss2001/&gt; The presence of an external [[electric field]] can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the [[Stark effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

If a bound electron is in an excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause [[stimulated emission]] of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make [[laser]]s, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.&lt;ref name=watkins_sjsu/&gt;

===Valence and bonding behavior===
{{Main|Valence (chemistry)|Chemical bond}}

Valency is the combining power of an element. It is equal to number of hydrogen atoms that atom can combine or displace in forming compounds.&lt;ref&gt;oxford dictionary – valency&lt;/ref&gt; The outermost electron shell of an atom in its uncombined state is known as the [[valence shell]], and the electrons in
that shell are called [[valence electron]]s. The number of valence electrons determines the [[chemical bond|bonding]]
behavior with other atoms. Atoms tend to [[Chemical reaction|chemically react]] with each other in a manner that fills (or empties) their outer valence shells.&lt;ref name=reusch20070716/&gt; For example, a transfer of a single electron between atoms is a useful approximation for bonds that form between atoms with one-electron more than a filled shell, and others that are one-electron short of a full shell, such as occurs in the compound [[sodium chloride]] and other chemical ionic salts. However, many elements display multiple valences, or tendencies to share differing numbers of electrons in different compounds. Thus, [[chemical bond]]ing between these elements takes many forms of electron-sharing that are more than simple electron transfers. Examples include the element carbon and the [[organic compounds]].&lt;ref name=chemguide/&gt;

The [[chemical element]]s are often displayed in a [[periodic table]] that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with the same number of valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table. (The horizontal rows correspond to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.) The elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons, which results in chemically inert elements known as the [[noble gas]]es.&lt;ref name=husted20031211/&gt;&lt;ref name=baum2003/&gt;

===States===
{{Main|State of matter|Phase (matter)}}

[[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|right|thumb|Graphic illustrating the formation of a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]]]
Quantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as [[temperature]] and [[pressure]]. By varying the conditions, materials can transition between [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, [[gas]]es and [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Identification==

The surface atoms deviate from the bulk [[crystal structure]] and arrange in columns several atoms wide with pits between them (See [[surface reconstruction]]).]]
The [[scanning tunneling microscope]] is a device for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. It uses the [[quantum tunneling]] phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on each of which is an [[adsorb]]ed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels—the [[Fermi level]] [[local density of states]].&lt;ref name=jacox1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=nf_physics1986/&gt;

An atom can be [[ion]]ized by removing one of its electrons. The [[electric charge]] causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a [[magnetic field]]. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field is determined by the mass of the atom. The [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] uses this principle to measure the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include [[inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy]] and [[inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]], both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.&lt;ref name=sab53_13_1739/&gt;

A more area-selective method is [[electron energy loss spectroscopy]], which measures the energy loss of an [[electron beam]] within a [[transmission electron microscope]] when it interacts with a portion of a sample. The [[atom probe|atom-probe tomograph]] has sub-nanometer resolution in 3-D and can chemically identify individual atoms using time-of-flight mass spectrometry.&lt;ref name=rsi39_1_83/&gt;

Spectra of [[excited state]]s can be used to analyze the atomic composition of distant [[star]]s. Specific light [[wavelength]]s contained in the observed light from stars can be separated out and related to the quantized transitions in free gas atoms. These colors can be replicated using a [[gas-discharge lamp]] containing the same element.&lt;ref name=lochner2007/&gt; [[Helium]] was discovered in this way in the spectrum of the Sun 23&amp;nbsp;years before it was found on Earth.&lt;ref name=winter2007/&gt;

===Formation===
Electrons are thought to exist in the Universe since early stages of the [[Big Bang]]. Atomic nuclei forms in [[nucleosynthesis]] reactions. In about three minutes [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] produced most of the [[helium]], [[lithium]], and [[deuterium]] in the Universe, and perhaps some of the [[beryllium]] and [[boron]].&lt;ref name=ns1794_42/&gt;&lt;ref name=science267_5195_192/&gt;&lt;ref name=hinshaw20051215/&gt;

Ubiquitousness and stability of atoms relies on their [[binding energy]], which means that an atom has a lower energy than an unbound system of the nucleus and electrons. Where the [[temperature]] is much higher than [[ionization potential]], the matter exists in the form of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]—a gas of positively charged ions (possibly, bare nuclei) and electrons. When the temperature drops below the ionization potential, atoms become [[statistical physics|statistically]] favorable. Atoms (complete with bound electrons) became to dominate over [[electric charge|charged]] [[particle]]s 380,000&amp;nbsp;years after the Big Bang—an epoch called [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], when the expanding Universe cooled enough to allow electrons to become attached to nuclei.&lt;ref name=abbott20070530/&gt;

Since the Big Bang, which produced no [[carbon]] or [[atomic number|heavier elements]], atomic nuclei have been combined in [[star]]s through the process of [[nuclear fusion]] to produce more of the element [[helium]], and (via the [[triple alpha process]]) the sequence of elements from carbon up to [[iron]];&lt;ref name=mnras106_343/&gt; see [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] for details.

Isotopes such as lithium-6, as well as some beryllium and boron are generated in space through [[cosmic ray spallation]].&lt;ref name=nature405_656/&gt; This occurs when a high-energy proton strikes an atomic nucleus, causing large numbers of nucleons to be ejected.

Elements heavier than iron were produced in [[supernova]]e through the [[r-process]] and in [[Asymptotic giant branch|AGB stars]] through the [[s-process]], both of which involve the capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei.&lt;ref name=mashnik2000/&gt; Elements such as [[lead]] formed largely through the radioactive decay of heavier elements.&lt;ref name=kgs20050504/&gt;

===Earth===
Most of the atoms that make up the [[Earth]] and its inhabitants were present in their current form in the [[nebula]] that collapsed out of a [[molecular cloud]] to form the [[Solar System]]. The rest are the result of radioactive decay, and their relative proportion can be used to determine the [[age of the Earth]] through [[radiometric dating]].{{sfn|Manuel|2001|pp=407–430, 511–519}}&lt;ref name=gs190_1_205/&gt; Most of the [[helium]] in the crust of the Earth (about 99% of the helium from gas wells, as shown by its lower abundance of [[helium-3]]) is a product of [[alpha decay]].&lt;ref name=anderson_foulger_meibom2006/&gt;

Atoms can also combine to create materials that do not consist of discrete molecules, including [[crystal]]s and liquid or solid [[metal]]s.&lt;ref name=pidwirnyf/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas99_22_13966/&gt; This atomic matter forms networked arrangements that lack the particular type of small-scale interrupted order associated with molecular matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Rare and theoretical forms===

====Superheavy elements====
{{Main|Transuranium element}}

While isotopes with atomic numbers higher than [[lead]] (82) are known to be radioactive, an "[[island of stability]]" has been proposed for some elements with atomic numbers above 103. These [[superheavy element]]s may have a nucleus that is relatively stable against radioactive decay.&lt;ref name=cern28509/&gt; The most likely candidate for a stable superheavy atom, [[unbihexium]], has 126&amp;nbsp;protons and 184&amp;nbsp;neutrons.&lt;ref name=cen84_10_19/&gt;

====Exotic matter====
{{Main|1=Exotic matter}}

Each particle of matter has a corresponding [[antimatter]] particle with the opposite electrical charge. Thus, the [[positron]] is a positively charged [[antielectron]] and the [[antiproton]] is a negatively charged equivalent of a [[proton]]. When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance between the number of matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although theories of [[baryogenesis]] may offer an explanation. As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature.&lt;ref name=koppes1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=cromie20010816/&gt; However, in 1996 the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom ([[antihydrogen]]) was synthesized at the [[CERN]] laboratory in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name=nature419_6906_439/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC20021030/&gt;

Other [[exotic atom]]s have been created by replacing one of the protons, neutrons or electrons with other particles that have the same charge. For example, an electron can be replaced by a more massive [[muon]], forming a [[muonic atom]]. These types of atoms can be used to test the fundamental predictions of physics.&lt;ref name=ns1728_77/&gt;&lt;ref name=psT112_1_20/&gt;&lt;ref name=ripin1998/&gt;

'''Beni Abbes Museum''' also known as ('''Béni Abbès Museum''') ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;متحف بني عباس&lt;/big&gt;}}) is an [[art museum]] located in oasis town of [[Beni Abbes]], [[Béchar Province]], [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Algeria-LIBRARIES-AND-MUSEUMS.html|title=Libraries and museums - Algeria - located|website=www.nationsencyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is "a resource dedicated to desert fauna, fossils and Algerian arts and crafts."&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.africa.com/guide_to_museums/algeria_museums|title= Museums in Algeria|accessdate=25 June 2012|author= |publisher= Africa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Displays==
Béni Abbès Museum is very popular in Algeria. It is supported by the Saharan Research Center. The museum houses displays desert fauna, fossils and traditional arts and crafts, such as carpets, wall hangings, ceramic items, woodcarvings and jewelry. The museum, which is supported by the Saharan Research Center, displays an extensive range of different types of dates. Dates are one of the mainstay crops of oasis towns and villages in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://saoura.over-blog.com/article-le-musee-de-beni-abbes-a-bechar-un-patrimoine-a-l-etat-d-abandon-41660219.html|title=Le musée de Béni Abbès à Béchar : Un patrimoine à l'état d'abandon - Béchar et la région de la Saoura|last=Sofiane|work=Béchar et la région de la Saoura|access-date=2018-02-01|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algerianembassy.org.my/musee.htm Algerian Museums Beni Abbes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322203903/http://www.algerianembassy.org.my/musee.htm |date=March 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myth==

The oasis of Beni Abbes has its own myth. Local people claim that:

:“The spring which waters this lush oasis came about as a miracle. It is said that a traveler pushed his walking-stick into the ground, declaring that if he should die in this place, water would come out of the ground. He apparently died the following night, possibly due to lack of water, and the spring began to flow, continuing to do so to this day”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.algeria.com/museums/beni-abbes/|title=Beni Abbes Museum, Saoura  {{!}} By Algeria Channel|website=www.algeria.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourist Destination==
The town of Beni Abbès is a popular tourist destination and the museum provides insights into its [[history]] and [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://looklex.com/algeria/beniabbs.htm|title=LookLex / Algeria / Beni Abbes|website=looklex.com|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biocol.org/search/node|title=Search|website=Global Registry of Biodiversity Repositories|language=en|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamanrasset.net/algerie.item.19/musees-en-algerie.html Beni Abbes Museum on Tamanrasset] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604215429/http://www.tamanrasset.net/algerie.item.19/musees-en-algerie.html |date=June 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arctic amplification===
{{main|Arctic amplification}}
The poles of the Earth are more sensitive to any change in the planet's climate than the rest of the [[planet]].  In the face of ongoing global warming, the poles are warming faster than lower latitudes.  The primary cause of this phenomenon is [[ice-albedo feedback]], whereby melting ice uncovers darker land or ocean beneath, which then absorbs more sunlight, causing more heating.&lt;ref name="RCAmp"&gt;[http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/01/polar-amplification/ Cecilia Bitz (2006): ''Polar Amplification'', in: RealClimate.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nature09051"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt; The loss of the Arctic sea ice may represent a [[tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]] in global warming, when [[runaway climate change|'runaway' climate change]] starts,&lt;ref name="2005gl025080"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2004gc000854"/&gt; but on this point the science is not yet settled.&lt;ref name="Arctic summer sea ice loss may not 'tip' over the edge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenman2009"/&gt; According to a 2015 study, based on computer modelling of aerosols in the atmosphere, up to 0.5 degrees Celsius of the warming observed in the Arctic between 1980 and 2005 is due to aerosol reductions in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/03/14/how-cleaner-air-could-actually-make-global-warming-worse|title=How cleaner air could actually make global warming worse|date=2015|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black carbon===
[[Black carbon]] deposits (from the exhaust system of marine engines that often run on [[bunker fuel]]) reduce the albedo when deposited on snow and ice, and thus accelerate the effect of the melting of snow and sea ice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rivm.nl/en/Documents_and_publications/Common_and_Present/Newsmessages/2016/Documentary_Sea_Blind_on_Dutch_Television Seablind documentary mentioning that the burning of bunker fuel by ships contributes to black carbon deposits on snow and ice in the Arctic]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2015 study, reductions in black carbon emissions and other minor greenhouse gases, by roughly 60 percent, could cool the Arctic up to 0.2&amp;nbsp;°C by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecentral.org/news/race-to-understand-black-carbons-climate-impact-21458|title=The Race to Understand Black Carbon's Climate Impact|publisher=ClimateCentral|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of sea ice==
{{See also|Arctic sea ice decline}}

Sea ice is currently in decline in area, extent, and volume and may cease to exist sometime during the 21st century.  Sea ice area refers to the total area covered by ice, whereas sea ice extent is the area of ocean with at least 15% sea ice, while the volume is the total amount of ice in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daily Updated Time series of Arctic sea ice area and extent derived from SSMI data provided by NERSC |url=http://arctic-roos.org/observations/satellite-data/sea-ice/ |accessdate=14 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910091853/http://arctic-roos.org/observations/satellite-data/sea-ice |archivedate=10 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in extent and area===

Blue shading indicates the pre-satellite era; data then is less reliable. In particular, the near-constant level extent in autumn up to 1940 reflects lack of data rather than a real lack of variation.]]

Reliable [[measurement of sea ice]] edges began with the satellite era in the late 1970s. Before this time, sea ice area and extent were monitored less precisely by a combination of ships, buoys and aircraft.&lt;ref name="Whither Arctic sea ice? A clear signal of decline regionally, seasonally and extending beyond the satellite record"/&gt; The data show a long-term negative trend in recent years, attributed to global warming, although there is also a considerable amount of variation from year to year.&lt;ref name="NASASeesArcticOcean"/&gt; Some of this variation may be related to effects such as the [[Arctic oscillation]], which may itself be related to global warming.&lt;ref name="The Arctic and Antarctic Oscillations and their Projected Changes Under Global Warming"/&gt;

The Arctic sea ice September minimum extent (i.e., area with at least 15% sea ice coverage) reached new record lows in 2002, 2005, 2007, and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/archive/2012/sea-ice-minimum|title= Record Arctic sea ice minimum confirmed by NSIDC|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130729155912/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/archive/2012/sea-ice-minimum|archivedate= 29 July 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 melt season let to a minimum 39% below the 1979–2000 average, and for the first time in human memory, the fabled [[Northwest Passage]] opened completely.&lt;ref name="nsidc"/&gt; The dramatic 2007 melting surprised and concerned scientists.&lt;ref name="Remarkable"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA - Monitoring Sea Ice"/&gt;

Multi-year ice is shown in bright white, while average sea ice cover is shown in light blue to milky white. The data shows the ice cover for the period of 1 November through 31 January in their respective years.]]

From 2008 to 2011, Arctic sea ice minimum extent was higher than 2007, but it did not return to the levels of previous years.&lt;ref name="nsidc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arcticseaiceextent"/&gt; In 2012 however, the 2007 record low was broken in late August with three weeks still left in the melt season.&lt;ref name="nsidc2"/&gt; It continued to fall, bottoming out on 16 September 2012 at 3.41 million square kilometers (1.32 million square miles), or 760,000 square kilometers (293,000 square miles) below the previous low set on 18 September 2007 and 50% below the 1979–2000 average.&lt;ref name="nsidc3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Record Arctic sea ice minimum confirmed by NSIDC"&gt;Record Arctic sea ice minimum confirmed by NSIDC&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of the decline in entire Arctic ice coverage is accelerating. From 1979–1996, the average per decade decline in entire ice coverage was a 2.2% decline in ice extent and a 3% decline in ice area. For the decade ending 2008, these values have risen to 10.1% and 10.7%, respectively. These are comparable to the September to September loss rates in year-round ice (i.e., perennial ice, which survives throughout the year), which averaged a retreat of 10.2% and 11.4% per decade, respectively, for the period 1979–2007.&lt;ref name="Accelerated decline in Arctic sea ice cover"/&gt;

===Changes in volume===
[[File:Plot arctic sea ice volume.svg|thumb|Seasonal variation and long-term decrease of Arctic sea ice volume as determined by measurement backed numerical modelling.&lt;ref name="zhangrothrock1"/&gt;]]
The sea ice thickness field and accordingly the ice volume and mass, is much more difficult to determine than the extension. Exact measurements can be made only at a limited number of points. Because of large variations in ice and snow thickness and consistency air- and spaceborne-measurements have to be evaluated carefully.  Nevertheless, the studies made support the assumption of a dramatic decline in ice age and thickness.&lt;ref name="Arcticseaiceextent" /&gt; While the Arctic ice area and extent show an accelerating downward trend, arctic ice volume shows an even sharper decline than the ice coverage. Since 1979, the ice volume has shrunk by 80% and in just the past decade the volume declined by 36% in the autumn and 9% in the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Masters|first=Jeff|title=Arctic sea ice volume now one-fifth its 1979 level|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/article.html?entrynum=2352|work=weather underground|date=19 February 2013|accessdate=14 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219012233/http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/article.html?entrynum=2352|archivedate=19 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===An end to summer sea ice?===

The IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 summarized the current state of sea ice projections: "the projected reduction &lt;nowiki&gt;[in global sea ice cover]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is accelerated in the Arctic, where some models project summer sea ice cover to disappear entirely in the high-emission A2 scenario in the latter part of the 21st century.″ &lt;ref name="Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Chapter 10"/&gt; However, current [[climate model]]s frequently underestimate the rate of sea ice retreat.&lt;ref name="2007gl029703"/&gt; A summertime ice-free Arctic would be unprecedented in recent geologic history, as currently [[scientific evidence]] does not indicate an ice-free polar sea anytime in the last 700,000 years.&lt;ref name="overpeck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ottera"/&gt;

The [[Arctic ocean]] will likely be free of summer [[sea ice]] before the year 2100, but many different dates have been projected. One study suggests 2060–2080&lt;ref name="ngeo467"/&gt; and another suggests 2030.&lt;ref name="Arctic Largely Ice Free in Summer Within Ten Years?"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Richard A.

==Permafrost thaw==

{{Main|Arctic methane release}}
This century, thawing of the various types of Arctic permafrost could release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. It has been estimated that about two-thirds of released carbon escapes to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, originating primarily from ancient ice deposits along the ~7,000 kilometer long coastline of the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) and shallow subsea permafrost. Following thaw, collapse and erosion of coastline and seafloor deposits may accelerate with Arctic amplification of climate warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=J. E. Vonk, L. Sánchez-García, B.

Climate models suggest that during periods of rapid sea-ice loss, temperatures could increase as far as {{convert|1450|km|abbr=on}} inland, accelerating the rate of terrestrial permafrost thaw, with consequential effects on carbon and methane release.&lt;ref name="yale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ucar.edu"/&gt;

As of 2018, modeling of the permafrost carbon feedback has focused on gradual surface thawing, models have yet to account for deeper soil layers. A new study used field observations, radiocarbon dating, and remote sensing to account for [[thermokarst]] lakes, the authors concluded that, "..methane and carbon dioxide emissions from abrupt thaw beneath thermokarst lakes will more than double radiative forcing from circumpolar permafrost-soil carbon fluxes this century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature|year=2018|title=21st-century modeled permafrost carbon emissions accelerated by abrupt thaw beneath lakes|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05738-9|doi=10.1038/s41467-018-05738-9|authors=Anthony et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Subsea permafrost===
{{Main|Clathrate gun hypothesis}}
Subsea permafrost occurs beneath the seabed and exists in the continental shelves of the polar regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=IPCC AR4|title=Climate Change 2007: Working Group I: The Physical Science Basis|date= 2007|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch4s4-7-2-4.html|accessdate= 12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This source of methane is different from methane clathrates, but contributes to the overall outcome and feedbacks.

[[Sea ice]] serves to stabilise methane deposits on and near the shoreline,&lt;ref name="2005gl022751"/&gt; preventing the [[clathrate]] breaking down and venting into the water column and eventually reaching the atmosphere. From sonar measurements in recent years researchers quantified the density of bubbles emanating from the subsea permafrost into the Ocean (a process called ebullition), and found that 100–630&amp;nbsp;mg methane per square meters is emitted daily along the East Siberian Shelf, into the water column. They also found that during storms, methane levels in the water column drop dramatically, when wind-driven air-sea gas exchange accelerates the ebullition process into the atmosphere. This observed pathway suggests that methane from seabed permafrost will progress rather slowly, instead of abrupt changes. However, Arctic cyclones, fueled by [[global warming]] and further accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could contribute to more release from this methane cache, which is really important for the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shakhova|first1=Natalia|last2=Semiletov|first2=Igor|last3=Leifer|first3=Ira|last4=Sergienko|first4=Valentin|last5=Salyuk|first5=Anatoly|last6=Kosmach|first6=Denis|last7=Chernykh|first7=Denis|last8=Stubbs|first8=Chris|last9=Nicolsky|first9=Dmitry|date=24 November 2013|title=Ebullition and storm-induced methane release from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf|url=http://www.homepages.ed.ac.uk/shs/Methane/Shakhova%202013.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Nature|volume=7|issue=1|pages=64–70|doi=10.1038/ngeo2007|accessdate=12 April 2014|via=|first10=Vladimir|last10=Tumskoy|first11=Örjan|last11=Gustafsson|bibcode=2014NatGe...7...64S}}&lt;/ref&gt; An update to the mechanisms of this permafrost degradation, implying the possibility of being close to an acceleration of methane release was published in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15872?WT.feed_name=subjects_climate-sciences | doi=10.1038/ncomms15872| pmid=28639616| pmc=5489687| title=Current rates and mechanisms of subsea permafrost degradation in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf| journal=Nature Communications| volume=8| pages=15872| year=2017| last1=Shakhova| first1=Natalia| last2=Semiletov| first2=Igor| last3=Gustafsson| first3=Orjan| last4=Sergienko| first4=Valentin| last5=Lobkovsky| first5=Leopold| last6=Dudarev| first6=Oleg| last7=Tumskoy| first7=Vladimir| last8=Grigoriev| first8=Michael| last9=Mazurov| first9=Alexey| last10=Salyuk| first10=Anatoly| last11=Ananiev| first11=Roman| last12=Koshurnikov| first12=Andrey| last13=Kosmach| first13=Denis| last14=Charkin| first14=Alexander| last15=Dmitrevsky| first15=Nicolay| last16=Karnaukh| first16=Victor| last17=Gunar| first17=Alexey| last18=Meluzov| first18=Alexander| last19=Chernykh| first19=Denis| bibcode=2017NatCo...815872S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing season has lengthened in the far northern latitudes, bringing major changes to plant communities in tundra and boreal (also known as taiga) ecosystems.

For decades, NASA and NOAA satellites have continuously monitored vegetation from space. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments measure the intensity of visible and near-infrared light reflecting off of plant leaves. Scientists use the information to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an indicator of photosynthetic activity or “greenness” of the landscape.

The maps above show the Arctic Vegetation Index Trend between July 1982 and December 2011 in the [[Arctic Circle]]. Shades of green depict areas where plant productivity and abundance increased; shades of brown show where photosynthetic activity declined.  The maps show a ring of greening in the treeless tundra ecosystems of the circumpolar Arctic—the northernmost parts of Canada, Russia, and Scandinavia. Tall shrubs and trees started to grow in areas that were previously dominated by tundra grasses. The researchers concluded that plant growth had increased by 7 to 10 percent overall.

However, boreal forests, particularly those in North America, showed a different response to warming. Many boreal forests greened, but the trend was not as strong as it was for tundra of the circumpolar Arctic. In North America, some boreal forests actually experienced “browning” (less photosynthetic activity) over the study period. Droughts, forest fire activity, animal and insect behavior, industrial pollution, and a number of other factors may have contributed to the browning.

"Satellite data identify areas in the boreal zone that are warmer and drier and other areas that are warmer and wetter," explained co-author Ramakrishna Nemani of NASA’s Ames Research Center. "Only the warmer and wetter areas support more growth."

"We found more plant growth in the boreal zone from 1982 to 1992 than from 1992 to 2011, because water limitations were encountered in the later two decades of our study," added co-author Sangram Ganguly of the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute and NASA Ames.&lt;ref name="The Greening Arctic"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=80637 | title = The Greening Arctic, NASA Image of the Day | accessdate = 16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The less severe winters in tundra areas allow [[shrubs]] such as [[alder]]s and [[Betula nana|dwarf birch]] to replace [[moss]] and [[lichen]]s. The impact on mosses and lichens is unclear as there exist very few studies at species level, also climate change is more likely to cause increased fluctuation and more frequent extreme events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alatalo | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Jägerbrand | first2 = A.K. | last3 = Molau | first3 = U. | year = 2014 | title = Climate change and climatic events: community-, functional- and species level responses of bryophytes and lichens to constant, stepwise and pulse experimental warming in an alpine tundra | url = | journal = Alpine Botany | volume = 124 | issue = 2| pages = 81–91 | doi = 10.1007/s00035-014-0133-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; The feedback effect of shrubs on the tundra's permafrost is unclear. In the winter they trap more snow which insulates the permafrost from extreme cold spells, but in the summer they shade the ground from direct sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The reduction of sea ice has boosted the productivity of [[phytoplankton]] by about twenty percent over the past thirty years. However, the effect on [[marine ecosystem]]s is unclear, since the larger types of phytoplankton, which are the preferred food source of most [[zooplankton]], do not appear to have increased as much as the smaller types. So far, Arctic phytoplankton have not had a significant impact on the global carbon cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Changes for animals==
{{further|Effects of global warming on marine mammals}}
The northward shift of the [[subarctic climate]] zone is allowing animals that are adapted to that climate to move into the far north, where they are replacing species that are more adapted to a pure [[Arctic climate]]. Where the Arctic species are not being replaced outright, they are often [[Grizzly–polar bear hybrid|interbreeding]] with their southern relations. Among slow-breeding [[vertebrate]] species, this often has the effect of reducing the [[genetic diversity]] of the [[genus]]. Another concern is the spread of [[Infection|infectious diseases]], such as [[brucellosis]] or [[phocine distemper virus]], to previously untouched populations. This is a particular danger among [[marine mammal]]s who were previously segregated by sea ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Polar Bear Habitat.png|thumb|left|Projected change in polar bear habitat from 2001–2010 to 2041–2050]]
3 April 2007, the [[National Wildlife Federation]] urged the [[United States Congress]] to place [[polar bear]]s under the [[Endangered Species Act]].&lt;ref name="Protection For Polar Bears Urged By National Wildlife Federation"/&gt;
Four months later, the [[United States Geological Survey]] completed a year-long study&lt;ref name="Uncertainty in Climate Model Projections of Arctic Sea Ice Decline: An Evaluation Relevant to Polar Bears"/&gt; which concluded in part that the floating [[Arctic sea ice]] will continue its rapid shrinkage over the next 50 years, consequently wiping out much of the polar bear [[habitat]]. The bears would disappear from Alaska, but would continue to exist in the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] and areas off the northern Greenland coast.&lt;ref name="Warming Is Seen as Wiping Out Most Polar Bears"/&gt; Secondary ecological effects are also resultant from the shrinkage of sea ice; for example, [[polar bear]]s are denied their historic length of seal hunting season due to late formation and early thaw of [[pack ice]].

==Melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet==
[[File:Greenland Albedo Change.png|left|thumb|Albedo Change on Greenland]]
[[File:Greenland Ice Mass Trend.jpg|thumb|[[Greenland Ice Sheet]] Mass Trend 2003–2005]]
Models predict a sea-level contribution of about {{convert|5|cm|in|0}} from melting in [[Greenland]] during the 21st century.&lt;ref name="ipcc"/&gt; It is also predicted that Greenland will become warm enough by 2100 to begin an almost complete melt during the next 1,000 years or more.&lt;ref name="Climatology: threatened loss of the Greenland ice-sheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Regional Sea Level Change"/&gt; In early July 2012, 97% percent of the Ice Sheet experienced some form of surface melt including the summits.&lt;ref name="nasa"/&gt;

Ice thickness measurements from the [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] satellite indicate that ice mass loss is accelerating. For the period 2002–2009, the rate of loss increased from −137 Gt/yr to −286 Gt/yr, with an acceleration of −30 gigatonnes per year per year.&lt;ref name="Increasing rates of ice mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets revealed by GRACE"/&gt;

==Effect on ocean circulation==
{{See also|Shutdown of thermohaline circulation|Ocean anoxic event}}

Although this is now thought unlikely in the near future, it has also been suggested that there could be a [[shutdown of thermohaline circulation]], similar to that which is believed to have driven the [[Younger Dryas]], an [[abrupt climate change]] event. There is also potentially a possibility of a more general disruption of [[ocean circulation]], which may lead to an [[ocean anoxic event]], although these are believed to be much more common in the distant past. It is unclear whether the appropriate pre-conditions for such an event exist today.

==Territorial claims==
{{Main|Territorial claims in the Arctic}}
Growing evidence that global warming is shrinking polar ice has added to the urgency of several nations' [[Territorial claims in the Arctic|Arctic territorial claims]] in hopes of establishing resource development and new shipping lanes, in addition to protecting sovereign rights.&lt;ref name="WashPost"/&gt;

Danish Foreign Minister [[Per Stig Møller]] and Greenland's Premier [[Hans Enoksen]] invited [[foreign minister]]s from Canada, Norway, Russia and the United States to [[Ilulissat|Ilulissat, Greenland]] for a summit in May 2008 to discuss how to divide borders in the changing Arctic region, and a discussion on more cooperation against climate change affecting the Arctic.&lt;ref name="EUX"/&gt; At the [[Arctic Ocean Conference]], Foreign Ministers and other officials representing the five countries announced the [[Ilulissat Declaration]] on 28 May 2008.&lt;ref name="Conference in Ilulissat, Greenland: Landmark political declaration on the future of the Arctic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Ilulissat Declaration"/&gt;

==Social impacts==
People are affecting the geographic space of the Arctic and the Arctic is affecting the population. Much of the climate change in the Arctic can be attributed to humans influences on the atmosphere, such as an increased [[greenhouse effect]]  caused by the increase in {{CO2}} due to the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciesin.org/docs/003-074/003-074.html|title=Greenhouse Effect|website=ciesin.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change is having a direct impact on the people that live in the Arctic, as well as other societies around the world.&lt;ref name="ClimateImpactAssessment"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hassol|first=Susan Joy|title=Impacts of a warming Arctic|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-61778-9|edition=Reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The warming environment presents challenges to local communities such as the [[Inuit]]. Hunting, which is a major way of survival for some small communities, will be changed with increasing temperatures.&lt;ref name="ethz.ch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecology.ethz.ch/education/Resilience_Stuff/Berkes_and_Jolly_2001.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JqZEroXP?url=http://www.ecology.ethz.ch/education/Resilience_Stuff/Berkes_and_Jolly_2001.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of [[sea ice]] will cause certain species populations to decline or even become extinct.&lt;ref name="ClimateImpactAssessment" /&gt; In good years, some communities are fully employed by the commercial harvest of certain animals.&lt;ref name="ethz.ch"/&gt;{{dead link|date=October 2016}} The harvest of different animals fluctuates each year and with the rise of temperatures it is likely to continue changing and creating issues for Inuit hunters. Unsuspected changes in river and snow conditions will cause herds of animals, including reindeer, to change migration patterns, [[Birth#Cattle|calving]] grounds, and [[forage]] availability.&lt;ref name="ClimateImpactAssessment" /&gt;

Other forms of transportation in the Arctic have seen negative impacts from the current warming, with some transportation routes and pipelines on land being disrupted by the melting of ice.&lt;ref name="ClimateImpactAssessment" /&gt; Many Arctic communities rely on frozen roadways to transport supplies and travel from area to area.&lt;ref name="ClimateImpactAssessment" /&gt; The changing landscape and unpredictability of weather is creating new challenges in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nuttall|first=Mark|author2=Pierre-André Forest|author3=Svein D.

===Navigation===
The [[Transpolar Sea Route]] is a future Arctic shipping lane running from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean across the center of the Arctic Ocean. The route is also sometimes called Trans-Arctic Route. In contrast to the [[Northeast Passage]] (including the [[Northern Sea Route]]) and the [[North-West Passage]] it largely avoids the territorial waters of Arctic states and lies in international high seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humpert|first=Malte|last2=Raspotnik|first2=Andreas|title=The Future of Shipping Along the Transpolar Sea Route|journal=The Arctic Yearbook|year=2012|volume=1|issue=1|pages=281–307|url=http://www.arcticyearbook.com/images/Articles_2012/Humpert_and_Raspotnik.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments and private industry have shown a growing interest in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/energy-development-arctic|title=As The Earth Warms, The Lure Of The Arctic's Natural Resources Grows|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major new shipping lanes are opening up: [[Northern Sea Route|the northern sea route]] had 34 passages in 2011 while the [[Northwest Passage]] had 22 traverses, more than any time in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/12/2011121913304370977.html|title=Melting Arctic brings new opportunities|first=Michael|last=Byers|website=aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shipping companies may benefit from the shortened distance of these northern routes. Access to natural resources will increase, including valuable minerals and offshore oil and gas.&lt;ref name="ClimateImpactAssessment" /&gt; Finding and controlling these resources will be difficult with the continually moving ice.&lt;ref name="ClimateImpactAssessment" /&gt; Tourism may also increase as less sea ice will improve safety and accessibility to the Arctic.&lt;ref name="ClimateImpactAssessment" /&gt;

The melting of Arctic ice caps is likely to increase traffic in and the commercial viability of the Northern Sea Route. One study, for instance, projects, "remarkable shifts in trade flows between Asia and Europe, diversion of trade within Europe, heavy shipping traffic in the Arctic and a substantial drop in Suez traffic. Projected shifts in trade also imply substantial pressure on an already threatened Arctic ecosystem."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bekkers|first=Eddy|last2=Francois|first2=Joseph F.|last3=Rojas-Romagosa|first3=Hugo|date=2016-12-01|title=Melting Ice Caps and the Economic Impact of Opening the Northern Sea Route|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=128|issue=610|language=en|pages=1095-1127|doi=10.1111/ecoj.12460|issn=1468-0297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===National===
Individual countries within the Arctic zone, [[Canada]], [[Denmark]] ([[Greenland]]), [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], and the [[United States]] ([[Alaska]]) conduct independent research through a variety of organizations and agencies, public and private, such as Russia's [[Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute]]. Countries who do not have Arctic claims, but are close neighbors, conduct Arctic research as well, such as the [[Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration]] (CAA).  The United States's [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) produces an [[Arctic Report Card]] annually, containing [[Peer review|peer-review]]ed information on recent observations of environmental conditions in the Arctic relative to historical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mashable.com/2017/12/12/arctic-ice-melt-warming-unprecedented-1500-years-report-card |title=Arctic warming, ice melt 'unprecedented' in at least the past 1,500 years |author=Andrew Freedman |date=12 December 2017 |website=[[Mashable.com]] |access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arctic.noaa.gov/Report-Card/Report-Card-2017 |title=Arctic Report Card: Update for 2017; Arctic shows no sign of returning to reliably frozen region of recent past decades |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;  |date= |website=[[NOAA.gov]] |access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
International cooperative research between nations has become increasingly important:
* Arctic [[climate change]] is summarized by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) in its series of [[IPCC#Assessment reports|Assessment Reports]] and the [[Arctic Climate Impact Assessment]].
* [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) launched [[CryoSat#CryoSat II|CryoSat-2]] on 8 April 2010. It provides satellite data on Arctic ice cover change rates.&lt;ref name="esa"/&gt;
* [[International Arctic Buoy Program]]: deploys and maintains buoys that provide real-time position, pressure, temperature, and interpolated ice velocity data
* [[International Arctic Research Center]]: Main participants are the United States and [[Japan]].
* [[International Arctic Science Committee]]: [[non-governmental]] [[organization]] (NGO) with diverse membership, including 23 countries from 3 continents.
* 'Role of the Arctic Region', in conjunction with the [[International Polar Year]], was the focus of the second international conference on Global Change Research, held in [[Nynäshamn]], [[Sweden]], October 2007.&lt;ref name="Global Environmental Change – The Role of the Arctic Region"/&gt;&lt;ref name="E SF, VR, FORMAS sign MOU to promote Global Environmental Change Research"/&gt;
* SEARCH ([[Study of Environmental Arctic Change]]): A research framework originally promoted by several US agencies; an international extension is ISAC (the International Study of Arctic Change&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcticchange.org/|title=Arctic Change|website=International Study of Arctic Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Compressed air''' is air kept under a [[pressure]] that is greater than atmospheric pressure. Compressed air is an important medium for transfer of energy in industrial processes. Compressed air is used for power tools such as air hammers, drills, wrenches and others. Compressed air is used to atomize paint, to operate air cylinders for automation, and can also be used to propel vehicles. Brakes applied by compressed air made large railway trains safer and more efficient to operate. Compressed air brakes are also found on large highway vehicles.

Compressed air is used as a breathing gas by [[underwater divers]]. It may be carried by the diver in a high pressure [[diving cylinder]], or [[surface supplied diving|supplied from the surface]] at lower pressure through an [[air line]] or [[diver's umbilical]].&lt;ref name="US Navy Diving Manual 2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=US Navy|first=|title=U.S. Navy Diving Manual Revision 7 SS521-AG-PRO-010 0910-LP-115-1921|url=http://www.navsea.navy.mil/Portals/103/Documents/SUPSALV/Diving/US%20DIVING%20MANUAL_REV7.pdf?ver=2016-12-14-135043-757|date=1 December 2016|publisher=US Naval Sea Systems Command|location=Washington, DC.|ref={{harvid|US Navy Diving Manual|2016}}|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228033101/http://www.navsea.navy.mil/Portals/103/Documents/SUPSALV/Diving/US%20DIVING%20MANUAL_REV7.pdf?ver=2016-12-14-135043-757|archivedate=28 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar arrangements are used in breathing apparatus used by firefighters, mine rescue workers and industrial workers in hazardous atmospheres.

In Europe, 10 percent of all industrial electricity consumption is to produce compressed air—amounting to 80 [[terawatt hour]]s consumption per year.&lt;ref name="tekniikkatalous"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tekniikkatalous.fi/energia/article218734.ece?s=u&amp;wtm=tt-24022009 |title=Paineilma hukkaa 15 hiilivoimalan tuotannon |first=Raili |last=Leino |date=24 February 2009 |language=fi |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717044303/http://www.tekniikkatalous.fi/energia/article218734.ece?s=u&amp;wtm=tt-24022009 |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fraunhofer"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://isi.fraunhofer.de/isi-de/publ/download/isi04p20/compressed-air-benchmarking.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111224105715/http://isi.fraunhofer.de/isi-de/publ/download/isi04p20/compressed-air-benchmarking.pdf |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2011-12-24 |title=Compressed Air System Audits and Benchmarking Results from the German Compressed Air Campaign "Druckluft effizient"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Industrial use of piped compressed air for power transmission was developed in the mid 19th century; unlike [[steam]], compressed air could be piped for long distances without losing pressure due to condensation.  An early major application of compressed air was in the drilling of the [[Mont Cenis Tunnel]] in Switzerland in 1861, where a 600 kPa (87 psi) compressed air plant provided power to [[Jackhammer|pneumatic drills]], increasing productivity greatly over previous manual drilling methods.  Compressed air drills were applied at mines in the United States in the 1870s. [[George Westinghouse]] invented [[Railway air brake|air brakes]] for trains starting in 1869; these brakes considerably improved the safety of rail operations.&lt;ref&gt;Lance Day, Ian McNeil (ed.), ''Biographical Dictionary of the History of Technology'', Routledge, 2002, {{ISBN|1134650205}},p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, Paris had a system of pipes installed for municipal distribution of compressed air to power machines and to operate generators for lighting.  Early air compressors were steam-driven, but in certain locations  a [[trompe]] could directly obtain compressed air from the force of falling water.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Darling (ed.), ''SME Mining Engineering Handbook, Third Edition'' Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration (U.S.) 2011, {{ISBN|0873352645}},p. 705&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breathing==
Air for breathing may be stored at high pressure and gradually released when needed, as in [[scuba diving]]. Air for breathing must be free of oil and other contaminants; carbon monoxide, for example, in trace amounts that might not be dangerous at normal atmospheric pressure may have deadly effects when breathing pressurized air. Air compressors and supply systems intended for breathing air are not generally also used for pneumatic tools or other purposes.

Workers constructing the foundations of bridges or other structures may be working in a pressurized enclosure called a [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]], where water is prevented from entering the open bottom of the enclosure by filling it with air under pressure. It was known as early as the 17th century that workers in [[diving bell]]s experienced shortness of breath and risked asphyxia, relieved by the release of fresh air into the bell. Such workers also experienced pain and other symptoms when returning to the surface, as the pressure was relieved.  [[Denis Papin]] suggested in 1691 that the working time in a diving bell could be extended if fresh air from the surface was continually forced under pressure into the bell. By the 19th century, caissons were regularly used in civil construction, but workers experienced serious, sometimes fatal, symptoms on returning to the surface, a syndrome called [[caisson disease]] or [[decompression sickness]]. Many workers were killed by the disease on projects such as the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] and the [[Eads Bridge]] and it was not until the 1890s that it was understood that workers had to decompress slowly, to prevent the formation of dangerous bubbles in tissues.&lt;ref&gt;E. Hugh Snell, ''Compressed Air Illness Or So-called Caisson Disease'' H. K. Lewis, 1896 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Air under moderately high pressure, such as is used when diving below about {{convert|20|m|ft|-1}}, has an increasing [[narcotic]] effect on the nervous system. [[Nitrogen narcosis]] is a hazard when diving. For diving much beyond {{convert|30|m|ft|-1}}, it is less safe to use air alone and [[Breathing gas|special breathing mixes]] containing helium are often used.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Uses of compressed air ==
[[File:Kompressorstation mit Druckluftspeicher.jpg|thumb|Air compressor station in a power plant]]
In industry, compressed air is so widely used that it is often regarded as the fourth utility, after electricity, natural gas and water. However, compressed air is more expensive than the other three utilities when evaluated on a per unit energy delivered basis.&lt;ref&gt;Yuan, C., Zhang, T., Rangarajan, A., Dornfeld, D., Ziemba, B., and Whitbeck, R. “A Decision-based Analysis of Compressed Air Usage Patterns in Automotive Manufacturing”, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 25 (4), 2006, pp.293-300&lt;/ref&gt;

Compressed air is used for many purposes, including:
* [[Pneumatics]], the use of pressurized gases to do work
** [[Pneumatic tube#Pneumatic post|Pneumatic post]], using capsules to move paper and small goods through tubes.
** [[Air tool]]s
** [[HVAC control system]]s

== Design of systems ==
Compressor rooms must be designed with ventilation systems to remove [[waste heat]] produced by the compressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://kaesertalksshop.com/2015/05/05/some-like-it-hot-your-compressor-room-doesnt/ |title=Some Like It Hot…Your Compressor Room Doesn’t |date=5 May 2015 |website=Compressed Air Tips from Kaeser Talks Shop |access-date=2017-01-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113165807/https://kaesertalksshop.com/2015/05/05/some-like-it-hot-your-compressor-room-doesnt/ |archivedate=13 January 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When air at atmospheric pressure is compressed, it contains much more water vapor than the high-pressure air can hold. [[Relative humidity]] is governed by the properties of water and is not affected by air pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fluidairedynamics.com/relative-humidity-vs-dew-point/ Fluid-Aire Dynamics, Inc. | Relative Humidity vs. Dew Point in Compressed Air Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; After compressed air cools, then the vaporized water turns to liquefied water.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.quincycompressor.com/why-dry-air-before-it-enters-air-compressor/ Quincy Compressor]&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.atlascopco.com/en-ph/compressors/wiki/compressed-air-articles/what-is-condensate-in-air Atlas Copco | How can water harm my compressed air system?]&lt;/ref&gt; Management of the excessive moisture is a requirement of a compressed air distribution system. System designers must ensure that piping maintains a slope, to prevent accumulation of moisture in low parts of the piping system.  Drain valves may be installed at multiple points of a large system to allow trapped water to be blown out.  Taps from piping headers may be arranged at the tops of pipes, so that moisture is not carried over into piping branches feeding equipment.

{{Distinguish|Dunnite}}
[[Image:Basanite&amp;Dunite bomb.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Small [[volcanic bomb]] of (black) [[basanite]] with (green) dunite]]
'''Dunite''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|d|ʌ|n|aɪ|t}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dj|uː|n|aɪ|t}}) (also known as '''olivinite''', not to be confused with the mineral [[olivenite]]) is an [[igneous rock|igneous]], [[plutonic]] [[rock (geology)|rock]], of [[ultramafic]] composition, with coarse-grained or [[phaneritic]] texture. The [[mineral]] assemblage is greater than 90% [[olivine]], with minor amounts of other minerals such as [[pyroxene]], [[chromite]], [[magnetite]], and [[pyrope]]. Dunite is the olivine-rich end-member of the [[peridotite]] group of mantle-derived rocks. Dunite and other peridotite rocks are considered the major constituents of the Earth's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] above a depth of about 400 kilometers. Dunite is rarely found within continental rocks, but where it is found, it typically occurs at the base of [[ophiolite]] sequences where slabs of mantle rock from a [[subduction zone]] have been thrust onto [[continental crust]] by [[obduction]] during continental or [[island arc]] collisions ([[orogeny]]). It is also found in alpine peridotite massifs that represent slivers of sub-continental mantle exposed during collisional orogeny. Dunite typically undergoes retrograde [[metamorphism]] in near-surface environments and is altered to [[serpentinite]] and [[soapstone]].

[[File:Peridotite Olivine-Orthopyroxene-Clinopyroxene Dunite highlighted.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|The dunite field is highlighted in green.]]
The type of dunite found in the lowermost parts of ophiolites, alpine peridotite massifs, and [[xenolith]]s may represent the refractory residue left after the extraction of [[basalt]]ic [[magma]]s in the upper mantle. However, a more likely method of dunite formation in mantle sections is by interaction between [[lherzolite]] or [[harzburgite]] and percolating silicate melts, which dissolve orthopyroxene from the surrounding rock, leaving a progressively olivine-enriched residue. Dunite may also form by the accumulation of olivine crystals on the floor of large basaltic or [[Picrite|picritic]] magma chambers. These "[[Cumulate rock|cumulate]]" dunites typically occur in thick layers in [[layered intrusion]]s,  associated with cumulate layers of [[wehrlite]], olivine [[pyroxenite]], [[harzburgite]], and even [[chromitite]] (a cumulate rock consisting largely of chromite). Small layered intrusions may be of any geologic age, for example, the [[Triassic]] [[Palisades Sill]] in New York and the larger [[Eocene]] [[Skaergaard complex]] in Greenland. The largest layered mafic intrusions are tens of kilometers in size and almost all are [[Proterozoic]] in age, e.g., the [[Stillwater igneous complex]] (Montana), the [[Muskox intrusion]] (Canada), and the [[Great Dyke]] (Zimbabwe). Cumulate dunite may also be found in ophiolite complexes, associated with layers of wehrlite, pyroxenite, and [[gabbro]].

Dunite was named by the German geologist [[Ferdinand von Hochstetter]] in 1859, after [[Dun Mountain]] near [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/287/1/375.abstract Johnston, M. R.; ''Nineteenth-century observations of the Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt, Nelson, New Zealand and trans-Tasman correlations,'' Geological Society, London, Special Publications 2007, v. 287, p. 375-387]&lt;/ref&gt; Dun Mountain was given its name because of the dun colour of the underlying ultramafic rocks. This color results from surface [[weathering]] that [[oxidation|oxidizes]] the iron in olivine in temperate climates (weathering in tropical climates creates a deep red soil). The Dunite from Dun Mountain is part of the ultramfic section of the [[Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt]].  

A massive exposure of dunite in the United States can be found as [[Twin Sisters Mountain]], near [[Mount Baker]] in the northern [[Cascade Range]] of Washington. In Europe it occurs in the [[Troodos mountains]] of [[Cyprus]]. In southern [[British Columbia]], Canada dunite rocks form the core of an ultramafic rock complex located near the small community of [[Tulameen]]. The rocks are locally enriched in [[platinum]] group metals, [[chromite]] and [[magnetite]].

==Carbon sequestration potential==
{{See also|Carbon dioxide removal|Enhanced weathering}}
Dunite could be used to [[Carbon dioxide sequestration|sequester]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and help mitigate [[Global warming|global climate change]] via accelerated chemical rock [[weathering]]. This would involve the mining of dunite rocks in quarries followed by [[comminution|crushing and grinding]] as to create fine ground rock that would react with the atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]]. The resulting products are [[magnesite]] and [[silica]] which could be commercialized.&lt;ref&gt;Danae A. Voormeij, George J.

[[File:Dybboel-moelle.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dybbøl with the historic [[Dybbøl Mill]]]]
'''Dybbøl''' is a small town with a population of 2,495 (1 January 2014)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistikbanken.dk/Statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?Maintable=BEF44&amp;PLanguage=1 "BEF44: Population 1st January, by urban areas"] database from [[Statistics Denmark]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the southeastern corner of [[South Jutland County|South Jutland]], Denmark. It is around {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Sønderborg]]. It is mainly known for being the site of a famous [[last stand]] [[Battle of Dybbøl|battle in 1864]].

During the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864, the Danish Army withdrew from the traditional fortified defence line, the [[Danevirke|Dannevirke]] (after waters and marshes which supported its flanks froze solid in a hard winter), and marched for Dybbøl to find a more defensible position. Although much [[artillery]] was abandoned and the evacuation was executed through a snow-laden north gale in winter, the army arrived almost intact. It entrenched itself at the Dybbøl Trenches, which became the scene of the siege and subsequent [[Battle of Dybbøl]] (7 April &amp;ndash; 18 April 1864). This battle resulted in a [[Prussia]]n-[[Austria]]n victory over Denmark.

In the following peace settlement, Denmark surrendered [[Schleswig]]. Following World War I, Denmark recovered the northern part of Schleswig as a result of the [[Schleswig Plebiscites]] as described in the [[Treaty of Versailles]].

The Dybbøl Mill is considered a Danish national symbol.

Dybbøl is also the birthplace of American landscape architect [[Jens Jensen (landscape architect)|Jens Jensen]].

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
Dybbøl has gone under a myriad of names throughout history, but it is theorized to have started as '''Dyttis Bol'''; after the founder Dytti, with Bol being an old Danish word for a single farm.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://navn.ku.dk/maanedens_navn/dybboel|title=Dybbøl|last=Knudsen|first=Bo Nissen|date=2014-04-01|website=navn.ku.dk|language=da|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://naturstyrelsen.dk/naturoplevelser/naturguider/dybboel-banke/historie/|title=Dybbøl Banke Historie|website=naturstyrelsen.dk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name would later evolve into its first written form, '''Duttebul''', as recorded in a Schleswig tax registry from 1352.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This name would be used for many years, until the T's started to get dropped, leading to the words eventual change to '''Dyppell''' in, for example, [[Johannes Mejer's atlas]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The name would continue to evolve in this trend, eventually changing out Bol/Bel in favour of the newer word Bøl, to finally produce '''Dybbøl'''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The town was also renamed to '''Düppel''' while under the rule of [[Prussia]] and later [[North German Confederation|German Confederation]] and [[German Empire|Empire]], from 1864 to 1920.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://1864.dk/dybboel-moelle/moellens-historie/|title=Møllens historie – Historiecenter Dybbøl Banke|website=1864.dk|language=da-DK|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-War ===
The town of Dybbøl started as part of a larger wave of [[expansionism]] during the [[Viking Age]] in Denmark, where hundreds of new land areas were settled, both in geographic Denmark as well as its many settlements abroad in, for example, England.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first traces of human settlement in Dybbøl go back to around 4.500 BC, and the town itself is estimated to have been founded around 800 AD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The town was, during the pre-war times, quite typical of the area. It's oldest building, from around 1100 AD, is a part of the local church structure, and the local peasants were [[serfs]] tied to [[Sandbjerg|Sandbjerg Castle]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ownership of the castle changed hands to the Reventlow Family, which meant that the serfs in the area got to benefit from being some of the first serfs able to buy their land and become independent when Conrad Georg Reventlow started to sell his property after the [[Stavnsbånd]] was lifted. Conrad Georg was one of the first lords to do this, which makes Dybbøl home of some of the very first self-bought free peasants in Denmark.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The First Schleswig War ===
{{Main|Battle of Dybbøl (1848)}}
During the First Schleswig War, Dybbøl was used as a flanking position for the Danish army in case of an attack from the south. The first battle of Dybbøl was fought on the 5. July 1848, when Prussian troops were driven back from Dybbøl by the Danish troops garrisoned there. During the month of April, there were regular skirmishes in and around the Dybbøl area, leading to the famous Dybbøl Mill being burnt down, resulting in it being out of commission for 4 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Interwar ===
During later years between the two Schleswig Wars, namely in 1861, Danish engineers began construction of Dybbøls [[trench]] system, which was finished in 1862. The system consisted of 10 [[Redoubt|redoubts]] in a 3 km long half-circle that stretched from [[Vemmingbund]] to the [[Alssund|Als Sound]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Geografi_og_historie/Milit%C3%A6re_forhold_og_krigshistorie/Milit%C3%A6r-_og_krigshistorie/Dybb%C3%B8l|title=Dybbøl {{!}} Gyldendal - Den Store Danske|website=denstoredanske.dk|language=da|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The redoubts were small earthen constructions with large powder stashes of concrete, as well as wooden [[Blockhouse|blockhouses]] for soldiers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The Second Schleswig War ===
{{Main|Battle of Dybbøl}}
As part of the Second Schleswig War, Danish forces retreating from the [[Danevirke]] arrived in Dybbøl on the 5. February.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The massive influx of soldiers and officers meant that the Dybbøl Mill became a temporary military headquarter, a role that the owners of the mill (a married couple) were famously happy to fulfil, to the point of them being honoured by veterans of the later battle at their wedding anniversary a century later.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On the 15. March the Prussian forces arrived to Dybbøl as part of their larger advance up [[Jutland]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They began a month long bombardment of the position, something they could do with impunity as they had [[Rifling|rifled]] [[Cannon|cannons]], something the Danish army did not. During the bombardment, the Prussian army worked to dig their own trenches towards the Danish ones as part of their assault preparations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

On the 18. April 1864, at 10:00, the Prussian army assaulted the Danish trench system. This was after 6 hours of continual bombardment, with more than 8.000 shells falling on the Danish trenches.

The assault was successful, and the Danish forces had to fall back to [[Als (island)|Als]].

=== After the war ===
After the Danish defeat in the Second Schleswig War, the resulting [[Treaty of Vienna (1864)|Treaty of Vienna]] meant that Dybbøl was now German territory as part of Prussia's conquest of the Duchy of Schleswig.

After the [[Unification of Germany]], the German Empire erected a large monument called the Düppel Denkmal, which became a tourist attraction for Germans all the way up to the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The monument was later destroyed in 1945 by [[Danish resistance movement|Danish rebels]] during the [[Denmark in World War II|Nazi-German occupation of Denmark]]. The mill in Dybbøl became a monument for the Danish-speaking part of Dybbøl however, which was the majority at that time as well, going so far as becoming the subject of several poems by Danish poet [[Holger Drachmann]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The German Empire also rebuilt the trench system in Dybbøl, making it much bigger and more expansive. These additional reinforcements never got to be used however, as Denmark did not participate in World War I. These newer fortifications are still visible at the Dybbøl Museum to this day.

In 1914, right before the advent of WW1, the German Empire celebrated the anniversary of their victory at Als. The celebrations were held at the newly constructed trench system at Dybbøl, where about 2.000 war veterans from both Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]] attended, along with the Emperors brother, [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1862–1929)|Prince Heinrich]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This would be the last German celebration in Dybbøl, as WW1 would break out shortly after.

=== The Reunification ===
After the end of World War I, populations in the former Duchy of Schleswig were given the opportunity through the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Treaty]] to vote for which country they would rather be part of; Germany (now the [[Weimar Republic]]) or Denmark. The votes resulted in the borders as they are to this day.

The reunification resulted in celebration in Dybbøl, culminating in a visit by [[Christian X of Denmark|King Christian X]] on the 11. July 1920. A massive party was held while the king visited in the 10th redoubt in the newer German trenches. This redoubt would later become known as Kongeskansen (The Royal Redoubt).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Around 50.000 people were present for the celebrations, along with the King and the entire royal Danish family. The climax of the celebrations were the handing over of an old [[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]] to the king by a veteran of the Battle of Dybbøl.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Modern day ===
Dybbøl continues to be a symbol of pride in Denmark, with it often being associated with a heroic last, similar to the [[Battle of the Alamo|Alamo]] in American conscience. Because of this, the entire town and most of the surrounding area has gradually become protected area, with it being illegal to disturb the trenches, mill and surrounding area.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The most notable institution in the town today is the museum, which is a popular school trip destination.

== National Park status ==
The site is a national memorial and museum of the Battle of Dybbøl and was therefore included in the 'National Park Dybbøl Skanser,' inaugurated in 1924. This park is not included in the Danish National Park laws of 2007, but it can still use the name National Park. The area is today administered as a 'Historiecenter Dybbøl Banke' (Dybbøl Banke Museum and History Centre).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danmarksnationalparker.dk/Om/Hvad/ What is a Danish National Park?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203065709/http://www.danmarksnationalparker.dk/Om/Hvad/ |date=3 December 2013 }} Danish Nature Agency {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum-sonderjylland.dk/dybbol-banke.html Dybbøl Banke Museum and History Centre] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fulgurites''' (from the [[Latin]] ''fulgur'', meaning "[[lightning]]") are natural tubes, clumps, or masses of sintered, vitrified, and/or fused soil, sand, rock, organic debris and other sediments that can form when lightning discharges into ground. They can therefore be referred to as petrified lightning. They are classified as a variety of the [[mineraloid]] [[lechatelierite]], although their absolute chemical composition is dependent on the physical and chemical properties of the usually granular-crystalline material providing an electrically and thermally conductive dissipation network for lightning-facilitated energy transfer. They are commonly hollow and/or branching assemblages of [[glassy]], [[protocrystalline]], and heterogeneously [[microcrystalline]] tubes, crusts, [[slag]]s, vesicular masses, and clusters of refractory materials that often form during the discharge phase of lightning strikes propagating into [[silica]]-rich [[quartz]]ose [[sand]], mixed [[soil]], [[clay]], or other sediments.&lt;ref name="scholarcommons.usf.edu"&gt;{{cite web |last=Joseph |first=Michael L. |url=http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5289&amp;context=etd |title=A Geochemical Analysis of Fulgurites: from the inner glass to the outer crust |date=January 2012 |publisher=Scholarcommons.usf.edu |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arizona.openrepository.com"&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://arizona.openrepository.com/arizona/handle/10150/144596 |title=Fulgurite Classification, Petrology, and Implications for Planetary Processes - The University of Arizona Campus Repository |publisher=Arizona.openrepository.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fulgurites are homologous to [[Lichtenberg figure]]s, which are the branching patterns produced on surfaces of [[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]]s during [[dielectric breakdown]] by high-voltage discharges, such as lightning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sgsmp.ch/lichtenberg.htm |title=SGSMP : Lichtenberg figures |publisher=Sgsmp.ch |date=2005-07-28 |accessdate=2015-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802001819/http://www.sgsmp.ch/lichtenberg.htm |archivedate=2015-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lichtenberg"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ouellette |first=Jennifer |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/fermilab-physicist-makes-frozen-lightning-art-with-accelerators/ |title=Fermilab Physicist Makes "Frozen Lightning" Art with Accelerators |publisher=Scientific American blog |date=23 July 2013 |accessdate=11 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Fulgurites are formed when lightning strikes the ground, fusing and vitrifying mineral grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/234/4773/189.short |title=Lightning Strike Fusion: Extreme Reduction and Metal-Silicate Liquid Immiscibility |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=1986-10-10 |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peak temperatures within a lightning channel are known to exceed 30,000 K, with sufficient pressure to produce [[planar deformation features]], or "shock lamellae," in SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a kind of [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]]. This is also known colloquially as [[shocked quartz]].&lt;ref name="ammin.geoscienceworld.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ammin.geoscienceworld.org/content/100/7/1645.abstract |title=Lightning-induced shock lamellae in quartz |publisher=Ammin.geoscienceworld.org |date=2015-07-01 |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471175943 ]{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.uncfsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&amp;context=chemphys_wp.html] {{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Artificial fulgurites" can also be produced when the controlled arcing of electricity into an appropriate medium.  Downed [[high voltage]] power lines have produced fulgurite-like [[lechatelierite]]s, occasionally colored by [[copper]] from the power lines themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agatelady.blogspot.com/2014/09/more-about-fulgurites.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase in common tube fulgurites is [[lechatelierite]], a silica glass also found in [[impactite]]s, but many other glasses may result from the processes involved with the production of fulgurites given their chemical context. Because their [[groundmass]] is generally [[amorphous]] in structure, fulgurites are classified as [[mineraloid]]s.

The optical properties (color, surface texture modulation) of fulgurites vary widely, depending on bulk composition, refractory inclusions, interface dynamics, and chemical "impurities," among other possible sources of variation.  Most natural fulgurites fall on a spectrum from colorless (transparent), to white, to black; moderate iron oxide content, among other factors, can result in a deep brownish-green coloration.  More colorful variants are usually synthetic and reflect incorporation of synthetic materials.  The interior of Type I (sand) fulgurites normally is very smooth or lined with fine bubbles, while other types are often both vesicular and dense, almost pore-free, or even [[scoria]]-like; their exteriors generally can be coated with rough sedimentary particles or small rocks and can be porous, smooth, or topologically-complex. Branching fulgurites display [[fractal]]-like [[self-similarity]] and structural [[scale invariance]] as a macroscopic or microscopic network of root-like branches, and can display this texture without central channels or obvious divergence from morphology of context or target (e.g. sheet-like melt, rock fulgurites). Fulgurites formed in sand or loose soil are mechanically fragile, making the field collection of large specimens difficult. Other fulgurite classes are often very durable and may withstand a long residence in the geologic record, an issue of some contention in planetary sciences, such as [[impact geology]].

Fulgurites can exceed tens of centimeters in diameter and can penetrate deep into the [[subsoil]], sometimes occurring as far as {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the surface that was struck, but may form directly on appropriate sedimentary surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ripley |first=George |last2=Dana |first2=Charles Anderson |title=The New American Cyclopaedia |page=2 |publisher=Appleton |date=1859}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the longest fulgurites to have been found in modern times was a little over {{convert|4.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, and was found in northern [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="grapes"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pyrometamorphism |first=R.

==Classification==

Fulgurites have been classified by Pasek et al. (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00410-012-0753-5#page-1 |title=Fulgurite morphology: a classification scheme and clues to formation - Springer |publisher=Link.springer.com |date=2012-04-24 |accessdate=2015-08-16 |doi=10.1007/s00410-012-0753-5 |volume=164 |journal=Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology |pages=477–492|bibcode=2012CoMP..164..477P }}&lt;/ref&gt; into five types related to the type of sediment in which the fulgurite formed, as follows:

*Type I - sand fulgurites with tubaceous structure; their central axial void may be collapsed
*Type II - soil fulgurites; these are glass-rich, and form in a wide range of sediment compositions, including clay-rich soils, silt-rich soils, gravel-rich soils, and [[loess]]oid; these may be tubaceous, branching, vesicular, irregular/slaggy, or may display a combination of these structures, and can produce exogenic fulgurites (droplet fulgurites)
*Type III - [[caliche]] or [[calcic]] sediment fulgurites, having thick, often surficially glazed granular walls with calcium-rich vitreous groundmass with little or no lechatelierite glass; their shapes are variable, with multiple narrow central channels common, and can span the entire range of morphological and structural variation for fulguritic objects
*Type IV - rock fulgurites, which are either crusts on minimally altered rocks, networks of tunneling within rocks, vesicular outgassed rocks (often glazed by a [[silicide]]-rich and/or metal oxide crust), or completely vitrified and dense rock material and masses of these forms with little sedimentary groundmass
*Type V - [droplet] fulgurites (exogenic fulgurites), which show evidence of ejection (e.g. spheroidal, [[botryoidal]], filamentous, or aerodynamic),&lt;ref name="scholarcommons.usf.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00410-012-0753-5#page-1 |title=Fulgurite morphology: a classification scheme and clues to formation - Springer |publisher=Link.springer.com |date=2012-04-24 |accessdate=2015-08-16 |doi=10.1007/s00410-012-0753-5 |volume=164 |journal=Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology |pages=477–492|bibcode=2012CoMP..164..477P }}&lt;/ref&gt; related by composition to Type II and Type IV fulgurites

== Significance ==
=== Paleoenvironmental indicator ===

The presence of fulgurites in an area can be used to predict the prevalence of lightning over the particular area over a certain period of time, which in turn can help in understanding the past climates, in the study of [[paleolightning]].&lt;ref name="Sponholz" /&gt; For instance, the fact that fulgurites are abundant in the central [[Sahara Desert]], where thunderstorm activity is very rare, demonstrates that thunderstorms were once more frequent in that region. As their spatial distributions guide reconstruction of convection and precipitation patterns, their bulk chemistry may lead to inferences about surface sediments and generally porous structures enclose and preserve samples of the ancient atmosphere in which they formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quest.nasa.gov/projects/spacewardbound/docs/NavarroGonzalez_etal_2007.pdf |format=PDF |title=Paleoecology reconstruction from trapped gases in a fulgurite from the late Pleistocene of the Libyan Desert |publisher=Quest.nasa.gov |accessdate=2015-08-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020150156/http://quest.nasa.gov/projects/spacewardbound/docs/NavarroGonzalez_etal_2007.pdf |archive-date=2011-10-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of [[paleolightning|LIRM]] anomaly (see [[paleomagnetism]]) and reconstruction of ancient environmental conditions are motivations for the identification and study of fulgurites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sponholz |first=B. |title=Fulgurites as paleoclimatic indicators: New approaches on Holocene climatic change in the Sahara |journal=First Joint Meeting of IGCP 490 and ICSU: Environmental Catastrophes in Mauritania, the Desert and the Coast |date=January 4–18, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Place in planetary processes and the geologic record ===

Many observations have been made in fulgurites of high-pressure, high-temperature materials more commonly assumed to be exclusive to meteoritic sources, products of asteroid impacts, comet airbursts, or [[cosmic dust]]. Such materials - as a suite - formerly considered to be unique to [[hypervelocity impact]]s, have been identified in fulgurites, including highly reduced silicon-metal alloys ([[silicides]]), the [[fullerene]] [[allotropes of carbon|allotropes]] C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; ([[buckminsterfullerene]]) and C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as high-pressure [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, collectively known as [[shocked quartz]], in fulgurites.&lt;ref name="arizona.openrepository.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ammin.geoscienceworld.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lightning strike fusion: extreme reduction and metal-silicate liquid immiscibility"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title= Fullerenes from a fulgurite|date=2015-04-20 |pmid=17733026 |doi=10.1126/science.259.5101.1599 |volume=259 |journal=Science |pages=1599–601 | last1 = Daly | first1 = TK | last2 = Buseck | first2 = PR | last3 = Williams | first3 = P | last4 = Lewis | first4 = CF|bibcode=1993Sci...259.1599D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heymann |first=D. |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc1996/pdf/1270.pdf |format=PDF |title=Chemistry of Fullerenes on the Earth and in the Solar System : A 1995 Review |journal=LPS |volume=XXVII |publisher=Lpi.usra.edu |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lpi.usra.edu"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Macdonald |first=F.A. |last2=Mitchell |first2=K. |last3=Cina |first3=S.E. |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2004/pdf/1406.pdf |format=PDF |title=Evidence for a Lightning-Strike Origin of the Edeowie Glass |journal=Lunar and Planetary Science |volume=XXXV |publisher=Lpi.usra.edu |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054051/http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/metsoc2010/pdf/5211.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title= Rapid Raman mapping of a fulgurite|date=2015-04-20 |pmid=20229006 |doi=10.1007/s00216-010-3593-z |volume=397 |journal=Anal Bioanal Chem |pages=2647–58 | last1 = Carter | first1 = EA | last2 = Pasek | first2 = MA | last3 = Smith | first3 = T | last4 = Kee | first4 = TP | last5 = Hines | first5 = P | last6 = Edwards | first6 = HG}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/368/1922/3087 |title=A Raman spectroscopic study of a fulgurite &amp;#124; Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences |publisher=Rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org |date=2010-06-07 |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v2/n8/full/ngeo580.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930024840/http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v2/n8/full/ngeo580.html |date=September 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sheffer |first=A.A. |last2=Dyar |first2=M.D. |last3=Sklute |first3=E.C. |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2006/pdf/2009.pdf |format=PDF |title=Lightning Strike Glasses as an Analog for Impact Glasses |journal=Lunar and Planetary Science |volume=XXXVII |date=2006 |publisher=Lpi.usra.edu |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kochemasov |first=G.G. |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc1985/pdf/1226.pdf |format=PDF |title=Fulgurite |journal=Lunar and Planetary Science |publisher=Lpi.usra.edu |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parnell |first=J. |last2=Thackrey |first2=S. |last3=Muirhead |first3=D. |last4=Wright |first4=A. |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2008/pdf/1286.pdf |format=PDF |title=Transient High-Temperature Processing of Silicates in Fulgurites as Analogues for Meteorite and Impact Melts |journal=Lunar and Planetary Science |volume=XXXIX |publisher=Lpi.usra.edu |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Galapagos Triple Junction''' is a geological area in the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] several hundred miles west of the [[Galapagos Islands]] where three tectonic plates - the [[Cocos Plate]], the [[Nazca Plate]] and the [[Pacific Plate]] - meet. It is an unusual type of [[triple junction]] in which the three plates do not meet at a simple intersection.  Instead, the junction includes two small microplates, the [[Galapagos Microplate]] and the Northern Galapagos Microplate, caught in the junction, turning synchronously with respect to each other and separated by the Hess Deep rift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v433/n7028/abs/nature03262.html|title=Counter-rotating microplates at the Galapagos triple junction|date=24 February 2005|author = Emily M.

'''George Shelvocke''' (baptised 1 April 1675{{spaced ndash}}30 November 1742) was an English [[Royal Navy]] officer and later [[privateer]] who in 1723 wrote ''A Voyage Round the World by Way of the Great South Sea'' based on his exploits. It includes an account of how his [[Captain (nautical)|second captain]], [[Simon Hatley]], shot an [[albatross]] off [[Cape Horn]], an incident which provided the dramatic motive in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''.

==Early life and naval career==
Born into a farming family in [[Shropshire]]{{sfnp|Poolman|1999|p=5}} and christened at [[St Mary's, Shrewsbury]], on 1 April 1675,{{sfnp|Fowke|2010|p=139}} Shelvocke joined the [[Royal Navy]] when he was fifteen years old. During two long wars with France he rose through the ranks to become a [[sailing master]] and finally [[lieutenant (navy)|second lieutenant]] of a flagship serving under Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Dilkes in the [[Mediterranean]]. However, when war ended in [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|1713]] he was beached without even [[half-pay]] for support. By the time he was offered a commission as [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] of the privateering ship ''Speedwell'', he was living in poverty.{{sfnp|Poolman|1999|pp=5–6}}

==Privateering voyage==
[[File:Dore - it was wondrous cold.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Engraving of sailors in the forward part of a sailing ship, with sea lions off the bow|Sailors in cold waters of the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Sea]] gawk at sea lions off their bow, in ''The Rime of the Ancient Mariner''. Engraving by [[Gustave Doré]].]]
Alongside the ''Success'', captained by [[John Clipperton]], the ''Speedwell'' was involved in a 1719 expedition to loot Spanish ships and settlements along the Pacific coast of the Americas. The English  had just renewed hostilities with Spain in the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]], and the ships carried [[letters of marque]] which gave them official permission to wage war on the Spanish and keep the profits.{{sfnp|Betagh|1728|pp=4, 6–7}} Shelvocke broke away from Clipperton shortly after leaving British waters and appears to have avoided contact as much as possible for the rest of the voyage.{{sfnp|Betagh|1728|p=13|ps=, "To show that Shelvocke was well enough pleased to part with his consort, he steered a course quite different from the ''Success'', and contrary to his duty".}}

On 25 May 1720 the ''Speedwell'' was wrecked on an island of [[Juan Fernández Archipelago|Juan Fernández]] called [[Más a Tierra]] by the Spanish.{{sfnp|Shelvocke|1726|pp=205–206}} Shelvocke and his crew were [[maroon]]ed there for five months but managed to build a 20-ton boat using some timbers and hardware salvaged from the wreck, in addition to wood obtained from locally felled trees. Leaving the island on 6 October,{{sfnp|Severin|2002|pp=77–78, 92}} they transferred into their first [[prize ship|prize]], renamed the ''Happy Return'',{{sfnp|Shelvocke|1726|p=293}} and resumed [[privateer]]ing, despite the war having ended in February and rendered their letter of marque invalid.{{sfnp|Severin|2002|pp=93–94}} They continued up the coast of South America from Chile to [[Baja California]], capturing more vessels along the way, before crossing the Pacific to [[Macao]] and returning to England in July 1722.{{sfnp|Fowke|2010|p=181}}

==Later life==
In England Shelvocke was arrested on charges of [[fraud]] at the instigation of the principal shareholders of the voyage, though he avoided conviction through out-of-court settlements with two of the complainants. They suspected, probably with reason, that he had failed to let them know about a significant portion of the loot obtained from the voyage, and planned to keep it for himself and other members of his crew. In this he likely succeeded.{{sfnp|Fowke|2010|pp=184–185}} The self-justifying version of events given by Shelvocke in the book ''A Voyage Round the World by Way of the Great South Sea'' was disputed by some who had accompanied him on that expedition, in particular by his [[Captain of Marines|captain of marines]], William Betagh.{{sfnp|Betagh|1728|pp=10–11}}

Shelvocke nevertheless went on to re-establish his reputation and died on 30 November 1742 at the age of 67,{{sfnp|Lysons|1796|loc=n.&amp;nbsp;55}} a wealthy man as a result of his [[buccaneer]]ing activity.{{sfnp|Fowke|2010|p=192|ps=, "Crime pays ... . Shelvocke, destitute when [shipowner] Edward Hughes offered him the position of commander in 1718, ended his days in ease and affluence".}} His chest tomb (since removed) in the churchyard of [[Deptford#Churches|St Nicholas, Deptford]], [[London]], by the east wall eulogised "a gentleman of great abilities in his profession and allowed to have been one of the bravest and most accomplished seamen of his time."{{sfnp|Lysons|1796|loc=n.&amp;nbsp;55}} A wall tablet in the [[chancel]] commemorates his son, also George Shelvocke, who died in 1760 and accompanied his father on the journey round the world before becoming Secretary of the [[General Post Office]] and a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]].{{sfnp|Lysons|1796|loc=n.&amp;nbsp;34}}

==Influence on Coleridge==
{{Wikisourcehas|1=the original text of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's|2=[[:wikisource:The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1800)|The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]}}
In his book Shelvocke described an event wherein his second captain, [[Simon Hatley]], shot a black [[albatross]] while the ''Speedwell'' was attempting to round [[Cape Horn]] in severe storms. Hatley took the giant sea bird to be a bad omen, and hoped that by killing it he might bring about a break in the weather.{{sfnp|Shelvocke|1726|pp=72–73}} Some seventy years later the episode would become the inspiration for the central [[plot device]] in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s narrative poem ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''.{{sfnp|Holmes|1989|pp=171–172}} Coleridge's friend and fellow poet [[William Wordsworth]] shared the following reminiscences on the origins of the poem:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Much the greatest part of the story was Mr Coleridge's invention; but certain parts I myself suggested: for example, some crime was to be committed which should bring upon the old navigator, as Coleridge afterwards delighted to call him, the spectral persecution, as a consequence of that crime, and his own wanderings. I had been reading in Shelvock's ''Voyages'' a day or two before that while doubling Cape Horn they frequently saw albatrosses in that latitude, the largest sort of sea-fowl, some extending their wings twelve or fifteen feet. "Suppose," I said, "you represent him as having killed one of these birds on entering the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Sea]], and that the [[tutelary spirit]]s of those regions take upon them to avenge the crime. The incident was thought fit for the purpose and adopted accordingly."{{sfnp|Holmes|1989|p=171}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] '''George Vancouver''' (22 June 1757 – 10 May 1798) was a British officer of the [[Royal Navy]], best known for his [[Vancouver Expedition|1791–95 expedition]], which explored and charted North America's northwestern [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] regions, including the coasts of contemporary  [[British Columbia]], Canada and [[Alaska]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Oregon]], United States. He also explored the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and the southwest coast of Australia.

[[Vancouver Island]] and the city of [[Vancouver]], British Columbia are named for him, as is [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], Washington. [[Mount Vancouver]] of [[Yukon]] and Alaska, on the Canadian-American border and [[Mount Vancouver (New Zealand)|New Zealand's sixth highest mountain]],&lt;ref name="Place Names"&gt;{{cite book|last= Reed|first= A.

==Early life and career==

George Vancouver was born in the seaport town of [[King's Lynn]] (Norfolk, England) on 22 June 1757 as the sixth, and youngest, child of John Jasper Vancouver, a Deputy Collector of Customs, and Bridget Berners.

In 1771, at the age of 13, George Vancouver entered the Royal Navy as a "young gentleman," a future candidate for [[midshipman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Landauer |first1=Lyndall Baker |title=Dictionary of World Biography: The 17th and 18th Centuries |chapter=George Vancouver |volume=4 |editor-last=Magill |editor-first=Frank N. |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |page=1355 |isbn=9781135924140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected to serve as a midshipman aboard {{HMS|Resolution|Cook|6}}, on [[Captain James Cook|James Cook]]'s [[Second voyage of James Cook|second voyage]] (1772–1775) searching for ''[[Terra Australis]]''. He also accompanied Cook's [[Third voyage of James Cook|third voyage]] (1776–1780), this time aboard ''Resolution'''s companion ship, {{HMS|Discovery|1774|6}}, and was present during the first European sighting and exploration of the [[Hawaiian Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/6771/ |title = Chart of the NW Coast of America and Part of the NE of Asia with the Track of his Majesty's Sloops 'Resolution' and 'Discovery' from May to October 1778 |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1778 |accessdate = 27 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to Britain in October 1780, Vancouver was [[commissioned officer|commissioned]] as a lieutenant and posted aboard the [[sloop]] {{HMS|Martin|1761|6}} initially on escort and patrol duty in the English Channel and North Sea. He accompanied the ship when it left [[Plymouth]] on 11 February 1782 for the West Indies. On 7 May 1782 he was appointed fourth Lieutenant of the 74-gun [[ship of the line]] [[HMS Fame (1759)|HMS ''Fame'']] which was at the time part of the British West Indies Fleet and assigned to patrolling the French-held [[Leeward Islands]]. Vancouver returned to England in June 1783.&lt;ref name="vancouverarchives"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sue Bigelow|title=Captain George Vancouver: original documents|url=http://www.vancouverarchives.ca/2013/06/20/captain-george-vancouver-original-documents/|publisher=City of Vancouver Archives|date=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1780s the [[Spanish Empire]] commissioned an expedition to the Pacific Northwest. The 1789 [[Nootka Crisis]] developed, and Spain and Britain came close to war over ownership of the [[Nootka Sound]] on contemporary [[Vancouver Island]], and of greater importance, the right to colonise and settle the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Northwest coast]]. [[Henry Roberts (Royal Navy officer)|Henry Roberts]] had recently taken command of the survey ship {{HMS|Discovery|1789|6}} (a new vessel named in honour of the ship on Cook's voyage), which was to be used on another round-the-world voyage, and Roberts selected Vancouver as his first lieutenant, but they were then diverted to other warships due to the crisis. Vancouver went with [[Joseph Whidbey]] to the 74-gun ship of the line {{HMS|Courageux|1761|6}}. When the first [[Nootka Convention]] ended the crisis in 1790, Vancouver was given command of ''Discovery'' to take possession of Nootka Sound and to survey the coasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, Robert J. |title=George Vancouver and the contemplated settlement at Nootka Sound|journal=The Great Circle|volume=32|issue=1|year= 2010|pages=6–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite book

===Vancouver Expedition===
{{Main|Vancouver Expedition}}
Departing England with two ships, HMS ''Discovery'' and {{HMS|Chatham|1788|6}}, on 1 April 1791, Vancouver commanded an expedition charged with exploring the Pacific region. In its first year the expedition travelled to Cape Town, Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, and Hawaii, collecting botanical samples and surveying coastlines along the way. He formally claimed at Possession Point, [[King George Sound]] Western Australia, now the town of [[Albany, Western Australia]] for the British. Proceeding to North America, Vancouver followed the coasts of present-day [[Oregon]] and Washington northward. In April 1792 he encountered American Captain [[Robert Gray (sea-captain)|Robert Gray]] off the coast of Oregon just prior to Gray's sailing up the [[Robert Gray's Columbia River expedition|Columbia River]].

Vancouver entered the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], between [[Vancouver Island]] and the Washington state mainland on 29 April 1792. His orders included a survey of every inlet and outlet on the west coast of the mainland, all the way north to Alaska. Most of this work was in small craft propelled by both sail and oar; manoeuvring larger sail-powered vessels in uncharted waters was generally impractical and dangerous.

Vancouver named many features for his officers, friends, associates, and his ship ''Discovery'', including:
* [[Mount Baker]] – after ''Discovery's'' 3rd Lieutenant [[Joseph Baker (captain)|Joseph Baker]], the first on the expedition to spot it
* [[Mount St. Helens]] –  after his friend, [[Alleyne Fitzherbert, 1st Baron St Helens]]
* [[Puget Sound]] – after ''Discovery's'' 2nd lieutenant [[Peter Puget]],&lt;ref name=wing&gt;{{cite book
|author1=Wing, Robert  |author2=Newell, Gordon
|title=Peter Puget: Lieutenant on the Vancouver Expedition, fighting British naval officer, the man for whom Puget Sound was named 
|publisher=Gray Beard Publishing
|year=1979|isbn=0-933686-00-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; who explored its southern reaches.
* [[Mount Rainier]] –  after his friend, Rear Admiral [[Peter Rainier, junior|Peter Rainier]].
* [[Port Gardner]] and [[Port Susan]], Washington –  after his former commander Vice Admiral [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Sir Alan Gardner]] and his wife Lady Susan.
* [[Whidbey Island]] – after naval engineer [[Joseph Whidbey]].
* [[Discovery Passage]], [[Discovery Island (British Columbia)|Discovery Island]], [[Discovery Bay, Washington|Discovery Bay]] and [[Port Discovery, Washington|Port Discovery]].

Vancouver was the second European to enter [[Burrard Inlet]] on 13 June 1792, naming it for his friend [[Sir Harry Burrard-Neale, 2nd Baronet|Sir Harry Burrard]]. It is the present day main harbour area of the City of Vancouver beyond [[Stanley Park]]. George Vancouver surveyed [[Howe Sound]] and [[Jervis Inlet]] over the next nine days.&lt;ref&gt;Little, Gary. [http://www.garylittle.ca/van250.html George Vancouver (1757–2007). 250th Birth Anniversary, Survey of the Southwest Coast of BC, June 1792]&lt;/ref&gt; Then, on his 35th birthday on 22 June 1792, he returned to [[West Point Grey|Point Grey]], the present-day location of the [[University of British Columbia]]. Here he unexpectedly met a Spanish expedition led by [[Dionisio Alcalá Galiano]] and [[Cayetano Valdés y Flores]]. Vancouver was ''"mortified"'' (''his word'') to learn they already had a crude chart of the [[Georgia Strait|Strait of Georgia]] based on the 1791 exploratory voyage of [[José María Narváez]] the year before, under command of [[Francisco de Eliza]]. For three weeks they cooperatively explored the Georgia Strait and the [[Discovery Islands]] area before sailing separately towards [[Nootka Sound]].

After the summer surveying season ended, in August 1792, Vancouver went to [[Nootka Sound|Nootka]], then the region's most important harbour, on contemporary Vancouver Island. Here he was to receive any British buildings and lands returned by the Spanish from claims by Francisco de Eliza for the [[Spanish crown]]. The Spanish commander, [[Juan Francisco Bodega y Quadra]], was very cordial and he and Vancouver exchanged the maps they had made, but no agreement was reached; they decided to await further instructions. At this time, they decided to name the large island on which Nootka was now proven to be located as ''Quadra and Vancouver Island''. Years later, as Spanish influence declined, the name was shortened to simply [[Vancouver Island]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Voyage of George Vancouver 1791–1795, Volume 1''. W. Kaye Lamb (ed.). Hakluyt Society. 1984. {{ISBN|978-0-904180-17-6}}. p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Nootka Sound Vancouver acquired Robert Gray's chart of the lower Columbia River. Gray had entered the river during the summer before sailing to Nootka Sound for repairs. Vancouver realised the importance of verifying Gray's information and conducting a more thorough survey. In October 1792, he sent Lieutenant [[William Robert Broughton]] with several boats up the [[Columbia River]]. Broughton got as far as the [[Columbia River Gorge]], sighting and naming [[Mount Hood]].&lt;ref name="Etulain2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Etulain|first=Richard W.|title=Western Lives: A Biographical History Of The American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8yXv_OdXxBUC&amp;pg=PA97|year=2004|publisher=UNM Press|isbn=978-0-8263-3472-5|pages=97–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vancouver sailed south along the coast of Spanish [[Alta California]], visiting [[Chumash people|Chumash]] villages at [[Point Conception]] and near [[Mission San Buenaventura]].&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;McLendon, Sally and Johnson, John R. (1999). [http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/chis/chumash.pdf ''Cultural Affiliation and Lineal Descent of Chumash Peoples in the Channel Islands and the Santa Monica Mountains''] Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History pp. 139–40 (98–99) Accessed 18 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Vancouver spent the winter in continuing exploration of the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]], the contemporary islands of Hawaii.

===Further explorations===
The next year, 1793, he returned to [[British Columbia]] and proceeded further north, unknowingly missing the overland explorer [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] by only 48 days. He got to 56°30'N, having explored north from Point Menzies in Burke Channel to the northwest coast of [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]]. He sailed around the latter island, as well as circumnavigating [[Revillagigedo Island]] and charting parts of the coasts of [[Mitkof Island|Mitkof]], [[Zarembo Island|Zarembo]], [[Etolin Island|Etolin]], [[Wrangell Island|Wrangell]], [[Kuiu Island|Kuiu]] and [[Kupreanof Island]]s.&lt;ref name=Vancouver1801&gt;{{cite book

He again spent the winter in the Sandwich Islands.

In 1794, he first went to [[Cook Inlet]], the northernmost point of his exploration, and from there followed the coast south. Boat parties charted the east coasts of [[Chichagof Island|Chichagof]] and [[Baranof Island]]s, circumnavigated [[Admiralty Island]], explored to the head of [[Lynn Canal]], and charted the rest of Kuiu Island and nearly all of Kupreanof Island.&lt;ref name=Vancouver1801/&gt; He then set sail for Great Britain by way of [[Cape Horn]], returning in September 1795, thus completing a [[circumnavigation]] of South America.

==Later life==
[[File:The caneing in Conduit Street. Dedicated to the flag officers of the British Navy.jpg|thumb|In ''The Caneing in Conduit Street'' (1796), [[James Gillray]] caricatured Pitt's streetcorner assault on Vancouver.]]

Impressed by the view from [[Richmond Hill, London|Richmond Hill]], Vancouver retired to [[Petersham, London|Petersham]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Three Intrepid Explorers, Discovery Richmond | url = http://www.discoveryrichmond.com/three-intrepid-explorers | accessdate = 30 January 2014 | ref = retire | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140228134747/http://www.discoveryrichmond.com/three-intrepid-explorers/ | archive-date = 28 February 2014 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vancouver faced difficulties when he returned home to England. The accomplished and politically well-connected [[naturalist]] [[Archibald Menzies]] complained that his servant had been pressed into service during a shipboard emergency; [[sailing master]] [[Joseph Whidbey]] had a competing claim for pay as expedition [[astronomer]]; and [[Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford]], whom Vancouver had disciplined for numerous infractions and eventually sent home in disgrace, proceeded to harass him publicly and privately.

Pitt's allies, including his cousin, Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]], attacked Vancouver in the press. Thomas Pitt took a more direct approach; on 29 August 1796 he sent Vancouver a letter heaping many insults on the head of his former captain, and challenging him to a duel. Vancouver gravely replied that he was unable "in a private capacity to answer for his public conduct in his official duty," and offered instead to submit to formal examination by [[flag officer]]s. Pitt chose instead to stalk Vancouver, ultimately assaulting him on a London street corner. The terms of their subsequent legal dispute required both parties to keep the peace, but nothing stopped Vancouver's civilian brother Charles from interposing and giving Pitt blow after blow until onlookers restrained the attacker. Charges and counter-charges flew in the press, with the wealthy Camelford faction having the greater firepower until Vancouver, ailing from his long naval service, died.

==Death==
Vancouver, at one time amongst Britain's greatest explorers and navigators, died in obscurity on 10 May 1798 at the age of 40, less than three years after completing his voyages and expeditions.&lt;ref name=cave&gt;{{cite book | last=Cave | first1=Edward ("Sylvanus Urban") | authorlink=Edward Cave | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fNERAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover| title=[[The Gentleman's Magazine]], and Historical Chronicle | chapter=Obituary of Remarkable Persons with Biographical Anecdotes | volume=68 | location=London | publisher=John Nichols | year=1798 | page=447}}&lt;/ref&gt; No official cause of death was stated, as the medical records pertaining to Vancouver were destroyed; one doctor named John Naish claimed Vancouver died from kidney failure, while others believed it was a [[Hyperthyroidism|hyperthyroid]] condition.&lt;ref name="cooksociety"&gt;{{cite web|title=George Vancouver (1757–1798) part five: after the voyage|url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/home/detail/george-vancouver-1757-1798-part-five-after-the-voyage|publisher=The Captain Cook Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grave is in the churchyard of [[St Peter's Church, Petersham]], in the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|4947|Capt George Vancouver}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Hudson's Bay Company]] placed a memorial plaque in the church in 1841.&lt;ref name= "Unchartered"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Boyes |first1=Valerie |last2=Wintersinger |first2=Natascha|publisher=[[Museum of Richmond]] | title =Encountering the Unchartered and Back – three explorers: Ball, Vancouver and Burton|pages=9–10 |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His grave in [[Portland stone]], renovated in the 1960s, is now [[Listed building|Grade II listed]] in view of its historical associations.&lt;ref name= "Unchartered"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Listing"&gt;{{NHLE | num=1380182 | desc=Tomb of Captain George Vancouver in the Churchyard of St Peter's Church | accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===Navigation===
Vancouver determined that the [[Northwest Passage]] did not exist at the latitudes that had long been suggested. His charts of the North American northwest coast were so extremely accurate that they served as the key reference for coastal navigation for generations. Robin Fisher, the academic Vice-President of [[Mount Royal University]] in Calgary and author of two books on Vancouver, states:
{{quote|He put the northwest coast on the map...He drew up a map of the north-west coast that was accurate to the 9th degree, to the point it was still being used into the modern day as a navigational aid. That's unusual for a map from that early a time.&lt;ref name=pynn530&gt;Pynn, Larry (30 May 2007) "Charting the Coast," ''The [[Vancouver Sun]]'', p.B3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, Vancouver failed to discover two of the largest and most important rivers on the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific coast]], the [[Fraser River]] and the [[Columbia River]]. He also missed the [[Skeena River]] near Prince Rupert in northern British Columbia. Vancouver did eventually learn of the river before he finished his survey—from [[Robert Gray (sea-captain)|Robert Gray]], captain of the American merchant ship that conducted the first [[Robert Gray's Columbia River expedition|Euroamerican sailing of the Columbia River]] on 11 May 1792, after first sighting it on an earlier voyage in 1788. However it and the Fraser River never made it onto Vancouver's charts.
Stephen R. Bown, noted in ''[[Mercator's World]]'' magazine (November/December 1999) that:

{{quote|How Vancouver could have missed these rivers while accurately charting hundreds of comparatively insignificant inlets, islands, and streams is hard to fathom. What is certain is that his failure to spot the Columbia had great implications for the future political development of the Pacific Northwest....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Stephen R. |year=1999 |title=In the Most Faithful Manner |journal=Mercator's World |volume=4 |issue=6 |url=//mercatorsworld.com/article.php3?i=67 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030619143254/http://mercatorsworld.com/article.php3?i=67 |archivedate=19 June 2003 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bcgnis|id=24320 |title=Vancouver}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While it is difficult to comprehend how Vancouver missed the Fraser River, much of this river's delta was subject to flooding and summer [[freshet]] which prevented the captain from spotting any of its great channels as he sailed the entire shoreline from [[Point Roberts, Washington]] to [[West Point Grey|Point Grey]] in 1792.&lt;ref name=Hume&gt;Hume, Stephen (17 November 2007) "The Birth of Modern British Columbia Part 7", ''The Vancouver Sun'', p. D9&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest]], with the 1791 [[Francisco de Eliza]] expedition preceding Vancouver by a year, had also missed the Fraser River although they knew from its muddy plume that there was a major river located nearby.&lt;ref name=Hume/&gt;

===Indigenous peoples===
Vancouver generally established a good rapport with both Indigenous peoples and European trappers. Historical records show Vancouver enjoyed good relations with native leaders both in Hawaii – where King [[Kamehameha I]] ceded Hawaii to Vancouver in 1794 – as well as the Pacific Northwest and California.&lt;ref name=Pynn529&gt;Pynn, Larry "Peaceful Encounters" (29 May 2007), ''The [[Vancouver Sun]]'', p. B3&lt;/ref&gt; Vancouver's journals exhibit a high degree of sensitivity to natives. He wrote of meeting the [[Chumash people]],&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt; and of his exploration of a small island on the Californian coast on which an important burial site was marked by a sepulchre of "peculiar character" lined with boards and fragments of military instruments lying near a square box covered with mats.&lt;ref name=Pynn529/&gt; Vancouver states:

{{quote|This we naturally conjectured contained the remains of some person of consequence, and it much excited the curiosity of some of our party; but as further examination could not possibly have served any useful purpose, and might have given umbrage and pain to the friends of the deceased, should it be their custom to visit the repositories of their dead, I did not think it right that it should be disturbed.&lt;ref name=Pynn529/&gt; }}

Vancouver also displayed contempt in his journals towards unscrupulous western traders who provided guns to natives by writing:

{{quote|I am extremely concerned to be compelled to state here, that many of the traders from the civilised world have not only pursued a line of conduct, diametrically opposite to the true principles of justice in their commercial dealings, but have fomented discords, and stirred up contentions, between the different tribes, in order to increase the demand for these destructive engines... They have been likewise eager to instruct the natives in the use of European arms of all descriptions; and have shewn by their own example, that they consider gain as the only object of pursuit; and whether this be acquired by fair and honourable means, or otherwise, so long as the advantage is secured, the manner how it is obtained seems to have been, with too many of them, but a very secondary consideration.&lt;ref name=Pynn529/&gt;}}

Robin Fisher notes that Vancouver's "relationships with aboriginal groups were generally peaceful; indeed, his detailed survey would not have been possible if they had been hostile."&lt;ref name=Pynn529/&gt; While there were hostile incidents at the end of Vancouver's last season – the most serious of which involved a clash with [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]s at [[Behm Canal]] in southeast Alaska in 1794 – these were the exceptions to Vancouver's exploration of the US and Canadian Northwest coast.&lt;ref name=Pynn529/&gt;

Despite a long history of warfare between Britain and Spain, Vancouver maintained excellent relations with his Spanish counterparts and even fêted a Spanish sea captain aboard his ship {{HMS|Discovery|1789|2}} during his 1792 trip to the Vancouver region.&lt;ref name=pynn530/&gt;

This may be the first Canadian stamp not to show the subject's face.&lt;ref&gt;Pynn, Larry (24 May 2007) [http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/story.html?id=9a727afd-5ae5-4ffe-98ff-65f52dcea471&amp;k=40125 Mystery man: The Canada Post stamp honouring Captain George Vancouver has created a buzz with collectors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210032624/http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/story.html?id=9a727afd-5ae5-4ffe-98ff-65f52dcea471&amp;k=40125 |date=10 December 2007 }}, ''Vancouver Sun''&lt;/ref&gt;

The City of [[Vancouver]] in Canada organised a celebration to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Vancouver's birth, in June 2007 at the [[Vancouver Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref name=pynn623&gt;Pynn, Larry (23 June 2007) "Native elder embraces captain's legacy", ''The Vancouver Sun'', p. B9&lt;/ref&gt; The one-hour festivities included the presentation of a massive 63 by 114 centimetre [[carrot cake]], the firing of a gun salute by the [[Royal Canadian Artillery]]'s 15th Field Regiment and a performance by the Vancouver Firefighter's Band.&lt;ref name=pynn623/&gt;
Vancouver's then-mayor, [[Sam Sullivan]], officially declared 22 June 2007 to be "George Day".&lt;ref name=pynn623/&gt;

The [[Musqueam]] (xʷməθkʷəy̓əm) Elder sɁəyeɬəq (Larry Grant) attended the festivities and acknowledged that some of his people might disapprove of his presence, but also noted:

{{quote|Many people don't feel aboriginal people should be celebrating this occasion...I believe it has helped the world and that's part of who we are. That's the legacy of our people. We're generous to a fault. The legacy is strong and a good one, in the sense that without the first nations working with the colonials, it [B.C.] wouldn't have been part of Canada to begin with and Britain would be the poorer for it.&lt;ref name=pynn623/&gt;}}

==Origins of the family name==
There has been some debate about the origins of the Vancouver name. It is now commonly accepted that the name Vancouver derives from the expression '''''van Coevorden''''', meaning "(originating) from [[Coevorden]]", a city in the northeast of the Netherlands. This city is apparently named after the "Coeverden" family of the 13th–15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=G.H. Anderson|title=Vancouver and his Great Voyage – The Story of a Norfolk Sailor|date=1923|publisher=Thew &amp; Son|location=[[King's Lynn]]|url=http://handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/182291|via=[[State Library of Victoria]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, a number of businessmen from the Coevorden area (and the rest of the Netherlands) moved to England. Some of them were known as ''[[Van Coeverden]]''. Others adopted the surname [[Oxford]], as in [[ford (crossing)|oxen fording (a river)]], which is approximately the English translation of ''Coevorden''. However, it is not the exact name of the noble family mentioned in the history books that claim Vancouver's noble lineage: that name was Coeverden not Coevorden.

In the 1970s, Adrien Mansvelt, a former consul general of the Netherlands based in Vancouver, published a collation of information in both historical and genealogical journals and in the ''Vancouver Sun'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Mansvelt, Adrien (February 1975) "The Vancouver – Van Coeverden Controversy". ''The British Columbia Genealogist'' Vol 4 No. 1,2,3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mansvelt|first1=Adrien|title=Vancouver: A lost branch of the van Coeverden Family|journal=BC Historical News|publisher=British Columbia Historical Association|volume=6|issue=2|date=February 1973|url=http://www.library.ubc.ca/archives/pdfs/bchf/bchn_1973_02.pdf|format=PDF|pages=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mansvelt, Adrien (1 September 1973) "Solving the Captain Vancouver mystery" and "The Original Vancouver in Old Holland", ''The Vancouver Sun''&lt;/ref&gt; Mansvelt's theory was later presented by the city during the [[Expo 86]] [[World's Fair]], as historical fact. The information was then used by historian [[W. Kaye Lamb]] in his book ''A Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean and Round the World, 1791–1795'' (1984).&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, W. Kaye [https://archive.org/details/voyageofdiscover01vanc ''A Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean and Round the World, 1791–1795''].  London, Printed for G.G. and J. Robinson&lt;/ref&gt;

W. Kaye Lamb, in summarising Mansvelt's 1973 research, observes evidence of close family ties between the Vancouver family of Britain and the Van Coeverden family of the Netherlands as well as George Vancouver's own words from his diaries in referring to his Dutch ancestry:

{{quote|text=As the name Vancouver suggests, the Vancouvers were of Dutch origin. They were descended from the titled van Coeverden family, one of the oldest in the Netherlands. By the twelfth century, and for many years thereafter, their castle at [[Coevorden]], in the Province of [[Drenthe]], was an important fortress on the eastern frontier. George Vancouver was aware of this. In July 1794, he named the [[Lynn Canal]] "after the place of my nativity" and Point Couverden (which he spelt incorrectly) "after the seat of my ancestors". Vancouver's great grandfather, Reint Wolter van Couverden, was probably the first of the line to establish an English connection. While serving as a squire at one of the German courts he met Johanna (Jane) Lilingston, an English girl who was one of the ladies in waiting. They were married in 1699. Their son, Lucas Hendrik van Couverden, married Vancouver's grandmother, Sarah. In his later years he ''probably'' anglicized his name and spent most of his time in England. By the eighteenth century, the estates of the van Couverdens were mostly in the Province of [[Overijssel]], and some of the family were living in [[Vollenhove]], on the [[Zuider Zee]]. The English and Dutch branches kept in touch, and in 1798 (the date of Vancouver's death) George Vancouver's brother Charles would marry a kinswoman, Louise Josephine van Couverden, of [[Vollenhove]]. Both were great-grandchildren of Reint Wolter van Couverden."&lt;ref&gt;''The Voyage of George Vancouver 1791–1795, Volume 1''. W. Kaye Lamb (ed.). Hakluyt Society. 1984. {{ISBN|978-0-904180-17-6}}. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2006 John Robson, a librarian at the [[University of Waikato]], conducted his own research into George Vancouver's ancestry, which he published in an article published in the British Columbia History journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robson|first1=John|title=Origins of the Vancouver Name|journal=British Columbia History|year=2006|volume=39|issue=4|pages=23–24|url=http://www.library.ubc.ca/archives/pdfs/bchf/bch_2006_04.pdf|publisher=British Columbia Historical Federation|format=PDF|issn=1710-7881}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robson theorises that Vancouver's forebears may have been Flemish rather than Dutch; he believes that Vancouver is descended from the Vangover family of [[Ipswich]] and [[Colchester]] in Suffolk. Those towns had a significant Flemish population in the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Baecklandt, David, "Was George Vancouver Flemish?", ''The Brussels Journal'', 21 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

George Vancouver named the south point of what is now [[Couverden Island]], Alaska, as ''Point Couverden'' during his exploration of the North American Pacific coast, in honour of his family's hometown of Coevorden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chuckdavis.ca/archives_coevorden.htm History of Metropolitan Vancouver]; chuckdavis.ca&lt;/ref&gt; It is located at the western point of entry to [[Lynn Canal]] in southeastern Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnr.state.ak.us/mlw/planning/areaplans/nseap/maps/13_haines_couverden.pdf Couverden Island]. dnr.state.ak.us&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works by George Vancouver==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Petersham, London|Petersham]] --&gt;
The Admiralty instructed Vancouver to publish a narrative of his voyage which he started to write in early 1796 in [[Petersham, London|Petersham]]. At the time of his death the manuscript covered the period up to mid-1795. The work, ''A Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean, and Round the World'', was completed by his brother John and published in three volumes in the autumn of 1798.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Review of new books|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000545/17990901/014/0033|work=The Scots Magazine|date=1 September 1799|pages=33–38|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second edition was published in 1801 in six volumes.&lt;ref name="cooksociety"&gt;{{cite web|title=George Vancouver (1757–1798) part five: after the voyage|url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/home/detail/george-vancouver-1757-1798-part-five-after-the-voyage|publisher=The Captain Cook Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vancouver's voyage round the world|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001475/18011107/010/0001|work=London Courier and Evening Gazette|date=7 November 1801|page=1|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Good Hope Jet''' is the northward-running shelf edge frontal jet of the Southern [[Benguela Current]] off the [[Cape Peninsula]] of [[South Africa]]'s west coast. The jet, an intrusion of water from the Agulhas Current, was first described by South African [[oceanographer]]s, [[Nils Bang]] and W.R.H. (Bill) Andrews&lt;ref&gt;Bang, N. D., and W. R. H. Andrews (1974), ''Direct current measurements of a shelf-edge frontal jet in the southern Benguela system'', ''[[Journal of Marine Research]]'', 32, 405 – 417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''South African Journal of Science'' (January 1978) Vol 74&lt;/ref&gt; in 1974.

The '''Gran Desierto de Altar''' is one of the major sub-[[ecoregion]]s of the [[Sonoran Desert]], located in the [[Sonora|State of Sonora]], [[Northwest Mexico]]. It includes the only active [[Erg (landform)|erg]] dune region in [[North America]]. The desert extends across much of the northern border of the [[Gulf of California]], reaching more than {{convert|100|km|mi}} east to west, and over {{convert|50|km|mi}} north to south. It constitutes the largest continuous wilderness area within the Sonoran Desert.

The eastern portion of the area contains the volcanic [[Pinacate Peaks]] region, and with the western Gran Desierto de Altar area, together they form the [[El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve]] and a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1410 UNESCO World Heritage Centre.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:20091211 - Puerto Penasco -63.jpg|375px|thumb|Sand dunes at [[El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve]], northwestern Sonora, México.]]
The Gran Desierto covers approximately {{convert|5700|sqkm}}, most of it in the Mexican state of Sonora. The northernmost edges overlap the border into [[Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument]] and [[Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge]] in southwestern [[Arizona]]. The dominant sand sheets and dunes range in thickness from less than {{convert|1|km|mi}} to greater than {{convert|12|km|mi}}. The total volume of sand in the Gran Desierto is about 60 cubic km. Most of that volume was delivered by the [[Pleistocene]] [[Colorado River]] which flowed through the present-day Gran Desierto area ~120,000 years before present. This Pleistocene [[River delta|delta]] migrated westward concomitant with [[strike-slip fault]]ing and [[rift]]ing associated with the opening of the [[Salton Trough]] and the [[Gulf of California]].&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, G., The Colorado Delta, Carnegie Institution/American Geographical Society, New York, 193 p., 1937a.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiography==
The eastern margin of the Gran Desierto abuts the [[Cenozoic]] [[volcanic]] complex of the [[Sierra Pinacate]], a composite volcanic field covering more than {{convert|1800|km|mi}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a summit elevation of {{convert|1206|m|ft}}. [[Aeolian processes|Aeolian]] sands have climbed onto many of the western slopes of the Sierras Pinacate, defining the eastern limit of the dune field. To the north, the sands thin out against the distal margins of [[alluvial fan]]s from the [[Tinajas Altas]] and [[Tule Mountains]] along the Arizona-Sonora border.  The southern border of the sand sea is the northern shore of the Gulf of California.

The southernmost extension of the [[San Andreas Fault]] cuts across the area and lies beneath several prominent [[granite]] [[inselberg]]s, most notably the Sierra del Rosario mountains which are surrounded by the erg on all sides. The Sierra Enternada is a smaller inselberg almost completely buried by the sand near the boundary of the Gran Desierto and the [[Pinacate Peaks|Pinacate volcanic complex]].

==Sand dune distribution==
The Gran Desierto is best known for its magnificent Star Dunes, many in excess of {{convert|100|m|ft}} high. More than two-thirds of the Gran Desierto is covered by sand sheets and sand streaks. The remaining area is split equally between a western population of [[star dune]]s and an eastern set of transverse or crescentic dunes. Some of the larger [[Dune#Crescentic|crescentic dune]]s in the northeastern sand sea exhibit reversing crests, a transitional morphologic feature associated with star dunes.

==Flora==
{{see also|List of flora of the Sonoran Desert Region by common name}} 
Vegetation assemblages of the Gran Desierto are typical of the lower Sonoran Desert with a marked difference in vegetation type and density with location. Large areas of the southern and eastern sand sea, especially near the margins, have a moderately dense (up to 20%) cover of perennial low shrubs and herbs such as bursage (''[[Ambrosia dumosa]]'') and longleaf jointfir (''[[Ephedra trifurca]]'') with creosote bush (''[[Larrea tridentata]]'') in areas of thin sand cover. [[Parkinsonia|Palo verde]]/[[acacia]]/[[Fouquieria splendens|ocotillo]] communities occur on alluvial slopes on the northern side of the sand sea, particularly in [[arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] and washes.&lt;ref&gt;Felger, R.S., Vegetation and flora of the Gran Desierto, Sonora, Mexico, Desert Plants, 2, 87-114, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Its estimated total vegetation cover at 15% in the star dunes and about 10% in the low transverse or crescentic dunes areas. These percentages are substantially greater than in most active dune fields where vegetation covers of 15% are more typical.&lt;ref&gt;[Seely and Louw, 1980]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several teams have examined the nests ([[Pack rat#Midden|middens]]) built by [[pack rat]]s as a proxy for ancient vegetation regimes.&lt;ref name="Van Devender 1979"&gt;Van Devender, T.R. and Spaulding, W.G., Development of vegetation and climate in the southwestern United States, Science, 204, 701-710, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall, W.E., Van Devender, T.R. and Olson, C.A., Late Quaternary arthropod remains from Sonoran desert packrat middens, southwestern Arizona and northwestern Sonora, Quaternary Research, in press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; All have concluded that the Gran Desierto has been a refugia for desert plants since at least the late Pleistocene. The Gran Desierto has served as a refuge for most dominant [[Mojave Desert]] plant species during cooler pluvial epochs as well. [[Carbon-14 dating|C14 dates]] for a midden from the [[Tinajas Altas Mountains]] showing assemblages of [[juniper]] and [[Yucca brevifolia|Joshua trees]] coexisting with contemporary Gran Desierto flora and fauna more than 43,000 years before present.&lt;ref name="Van Devender 1979"/&gt; Although midden studies do not provide information beyond the late Pleistocene, they do indicate that, in gross form, the climate of the Gran Desierto as recorded by plant communities has been desert-like since at least the peak of the [[Wisconsinan glaciation]].

==Climate==
The Gran Desierto has a warm-to-hot [[arid climate]]. Mean annual rainfall, most of which occurs between September and December, is 73&amp;nbsp;mm at [[Puerto Peñasco]], Sonora (located on the southeastern margin of the sand sea) and decreases northward toward [[Yuma, Arizona]] (on the northwestern edge) to 62&amp;nbsp;mm per year.&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster, N., Greeley, R. and Christensen, P.R., Dunes of the Gran Desierto sand sea, Sonora, Mexico, ''[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]'', 12, 277 -288, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mid-summer highs in excess of 45&amp;nbsp;°C are common in the central sand sea. Mid-winter lows of less than 10&amp;nbsp;°C are rare. Winds are controlled in part by the position and strength of the [[Sonoran Low]] in summer, creating southerly winds, and by the [[Great Basin High]] in winter, with north-to-northeasterly winds.

==Paleoclimate==
The well-documented [[pluvial]] epochs which occurred over much of the southwestern United States during the most-recent ([[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsin]]) [[ice age]] may not have extended as far south as the Gran Desierto.&lt;ref name="Van Devender 1979"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spaulding, W.G., Leopold, E.B. and Van Devender, T.R., Late Wisconsin paleoecology of the American Southwest, in, Wright, H.E., Jr., ed., Late Quaternary Environments of the United States, v. 1, Univ. of Minnesota Press, 259-293, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that the climatic regime of the past 150,000 years at this site has been one of gradually increasing aridity with current hyperarid conditions being firmly in place by at least 43,000 years ago.

As a minimum, it may be assumed that onshore coastal winds from the south were less important to sand movement when the Wisconsin shoreline was located 45&amp;nbsp;km seaward of its current position.

==Tectonics==
The Gran Desierto is located adjacent to a rapidly subsiding [[tectonic basin]], the [[Salton Sink|Salton Trough]], which is a northern extension of the Gulf of California, an embayment created by rifting initiated during the [[Pliocene]] along the [[East Pacific Rise]] and the [[San Andreas fault]] system &lt;ref name="Larson, R.L. 1968"&gt;Larson, R.L., Menard, H.W. and Smith, S., Gulf of California: A result of ocean floor spreading and transform faulting, Science, 161, 881-884, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelier, J., Colleta, B., Chorowicz, J., Ortlieb, L. and Rangin, C., Fault tectonics of the Baja California peninsula and the opening of the Sea of Cortez, Mexico, Journal of Structural Geology, 3, 347- 357, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;  Regional subsidence has propagated to the northwest as rifting and strike-slip faulting continues into the present day. The central portion of the nearby Salton Trough is more than {{convert|70|m|ft}}  below [[sea level]]; it is protected from marine embayment only by the natural dike of the [[Colorado River Delta]].
 
Ongoing tectonic activity modifies the Gran Desierto today. The southernmost extension of the San Andreas fault system, the [[Cerro Prieto Fault]], passes directly through the area before continuing offshore into the Gulf of California.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam, R., San Jacinto fault in northwestern Sonora, Mexico, Bull. G.S.A., 76, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;  Strike-slip movement in the area is as high as 60&amp;nbsp;mm/year.&lt;ref&gt;Curray, J.R. and Moore, D.G., Geologic history of the mouth of the Gulf of California, in, Crouch, J.K. and Bachman, S.B., eds., Tectonics and Sedimentation along the California Margin, Pacific Section-S.E.P.M., 17-36, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Gastil, R.G., Phillips, R.P. and Allison, E.C., Reconnaissance geology of the state of Baja California, G.S.A. Mem. 140, 170 p., 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1900, one magnitude 6.3 and two magnitude 7.1 [[earthquake]]s have originated within the erg. Most seismicity within the Gran Desierto originates at depths of five to six kilometers, corresponding to the transition between [[River delta#Sedimentary structure|deltaic deposits]] and [[Basement (geology)|basement]] [[crystalline rock]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Von der Haar, S. and Howard, J.H., Intersecting faults and sandstone stratigraphy at the Cerro Prieto geothermal field, Geothermics, 10, 145-167, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Local [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]] is still occurring along the [[Mesa Arenosa]], a drag folded fault block forming the coastal boundary.

==Origin==
The geological history of the Gran Desierto is intimately linked to the opening of the Gulf of California and the capture of the ancestral Colorado River; source areas that were adjacent to the Gran Desierto have shifted in position, basement topography has been altered continuously, and bedforms have been created, modified or completely destroyed and then reworked.

The Gran Desierto sand sheets and dunes are located atop deltaic deposits of the Pleistocene Colorado River. The lower Colorado River was captured by the Gulf of California 1.2 million years before present.&lt;ref&gt;Lucchitta, I., History of the Grand Canyon and of the Colorado River in Arizona, Az. Geol. Soc., in press, 15 p., 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  This event places an upper bound on the age of the Gran Desierto with the Colorado's major [[clastic sediment]] sources. [[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomeritic]] sands and silts beneath the Mesa Arenosa were examined by Colletta and Ortlieb and dated at between 700,000 and 120,000 years before present.&lt;ref name="colleta"&gt;Colleta, B. and Ortlieb, L., Deformations of middle and late Pleistocene deltaic deposits at the mouth of the Rio Colorado, northwestern Gulf of California, in Malpica-Cruz, V. et al.(eds.), Neotectonics and sea level variations in the Gulf of California area: A symposium, University Nacional Auton Mexico, Institute Geolocia, 31-53, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vertebrate]] [[fossil]]s found by Merriam within the deltaic deposits include [[Equus (genus)|Equus]], [[Gomphotherium]] and [[Bison]] and were assigned to [[Irvingtonian]] age (0.5 to 1.8 million years before present); dates consistent with the aforementioned capture of the lower Colorado River.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam [1965]&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of a [[giant anteater]] [[Myrmecophaga tridactyla]] was found in the deltaic deposits in the southern Gran Desierto. Van Devender notes that the specimen was found in association with fossils of [[mammoth]]s, [[sloth]]s and [[boa constrictor]]s; a tropical [[faunal assemblage]] which supports a contention that the Colorado River delta of a previous [[interglacial period]] (&gt;120,000 years ago) was much warmer and wetter than the present interglacial.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, C.A. and McDonald, H.G., First record of Giant Anteater (Xenarthra, Myrmecophagidae) in North America, Science, 236, 186-188, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paleo-deltaic deposits near [[Salina Grande]] correlate with a ubiquitous indurated shell deposit dated by Io/U [[Radiometric dating|radiometric methods]] at 146,000 + 13,000/-11, 000 years of age.&lt;ref name="colleta"/&gt;   Slate obtained [[Potassium-argon dating|K-Ar ages]] for [[basalt]] flows in the western Pinacates.&lt;ref&gt;Slate, J.L., Soil-Carbonate genesis in the Pinacate volcanic field, northwestern Sonora, Mexico, M.S. thesis, University of Arizona, Tucson, 85 p., 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this work, some aeolian activity may have been present as early as 700,000 years ago, as evidenced by the dated accretionary mantles on basalt flows of the Pinacate volcanic field.

Blount and Lancaster proposed that by late Pleistocene time, the Colorado River was a highly competent stream flowing through the area which is occupied today by the massive western star dune zone.&lt;ref&gt;Blount, Grady and Nicholas Lancaster, Development of the Gran Desierto sand sea, northwestern Mexico, Geology, v. 18, pp.&amp;nbsp;724–728, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  The seashore at this time was at least {{convert|45|km|mi}} south of its present-day location. Primary bed loads of poorly sorted gravel were deposited from present-day Yuma, Arizona to an area south of the present-day Sierra del Rosario mountains.
 
As rifting of the Gulf of California progressed to the northwest, and uplift along the coast began, the river channel shifted westward, leaving primary bedload deposits in the former channel and floodplain. Deltaic sediments beneath the Gran Desierto may be as much as {{convert|6000|km|mi}} deep.&lt;ref name="colleta"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biehler, S., Kovach, R.L. and Allen, C.R., Geophysical framework of the northern end of the Gulf of California structural province, in Marine Geology of the Gulf of California, van Andel, T .H. and Shor, G.G., eds., A.A.P.G., Memoir 3, 126-143, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual sediment loads prior to the damming of the Colorado River were prodigious. A single flood event deposited an estimated 100,000,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of coarse to medium sand as a sheet deposit on the modern delta just south of the international boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, G., Delta, estuary, and lower portion of the channel of the Colorado River, 1933 to 1935, Carnegie Institution, New York, 76 p., 1937b.&lt;/ref&gt;  Events like this, even if rare, could fill up the Gran Desierto in only a few millennia.

==Offshore features==
The synchronous development of the [[Colorado River Delta]] and the associated Gran Desierto sand sink continues offshore into the Gulf of California. Reports on the submarine [[topography]] of the Gulf of California by van Andel, describe three former [[river channel]]s on the [[seafloor]]: one originating at the present-day Colorado delta, another from the area of the paleo-delta between El Golfo and Salina Grande, and a third to the area of present-day [[Puerto Penasco]].&lt;ref&gt;van Andel, T.H., Recent marine sediments of Gulf of California, in Marine Geology of the Gulf of California, van Andel, T.H. and Shor, G.G., eds., A.A.P .G., Memoir 3, 216-310, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rusnak reported on sonar soundings which discovered the valleys and also describe two elongate depressions, each about {{convert|40|km|mi}} in length, into which the valley networks terminate at a depth of ~{{convert|180|m|ft}} below sea level. Those incised valley systems were also interpreted as [[fluvial]] in origin.&lt;ref name="Larson, R.L. 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruznak, G.A. and Fisher, R.L., Structural history and evolution of the Gulf of California, in Marine Geology of the Gulf of California, van Andel, T.H. and Shor, G.G., eds., A.A.P .G., Memoir 3, 144-156, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Jenny''' (16 August 1904, [[Basel]] – 23 June 1972, [[Dornach]]) was a [[physician]] and [[natural scientist]] who coined the term [[cymatics]] to describe acoustic effects of [[sound wave]] phenomena.

==Life and career==
Jenny was born in [[Basel]], Switzerland. After completing a [[doctorate]] he taught [[science]] at the [[Rudolph Steiner School]] in [[Zürich]] for four years before beginning [[medicine|medical practice]].

In 1967, Jenny published the first volume of ''Cymatics: The Study of Wave Phenomena.'' The second volume came out in 1972, the year he died. This book was a written and photographic documentation of the effects of sound [[vibration]]s on [[fluid]]s, [[Powder (substance)|powders]] and liquid paste. He concluded, "This is not an unregulated [[Chaos theory|chaos]]; it is a dynamic but ordered pattern."

Jenny made use of crystal [[oscillator]]s and his so-called [[tonoscope]] to set plates and [[artificial membrane|membrane]]s vibrating. He spread [[quartz]] sand onto a black drum membrane 60&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. The membrane was caused to vibrate by [[singing]] loudly through a cardboard pipe, and the sand produced [[symmetry|symmetrical]] [[Chladni patterns]], named after [[Ernst Chladni]], who had discovered this phenomenon in 1787. Low [[Pitch (music)|tones]] resulted in rather simple and clear pictures, while higher tones formed more complex structures.&lt;ref name="deschin"&gt;Deschin, Jacob (April 28, 1968). Science Vibrates to Make Pictures. ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Chladni's and Jenny's work influenced [[Alvin Lucier]] and helped lead to his composition ''Queen of the South''. Cymatics was also followed up by [[Center for Advanced Visual Studies]] (CAVS) founder [[György Kepes]] at [[MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/cavs/people/kepes/kepes.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2002-11-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021104072629/http://web.mit.edu/cavs/people/kepes/kepes.html |archivedate=November 4, 2002 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work in this area included an [[Acoustics|acoustically]] vibrated piece of sheet metal in which small holes had been drilled in a grid. Small flames of gas burned through these holes and [[thermodynamic]] patterns were made visible by this setup. A special edition of the [[Hafler Trio]]'s work ''Exactly As I Say'' includes a DVD containing material said to be "based on and extended from techniques suggested by Prof. Hans Jenny".
Photographer [[Alexander Lauterwasser]] has also captured imagery of water surfaces set into motion by sound sources ranging from [[sine wave]]s to music by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] and [[overtone singing]].

'''Hin Namno''' or Hin Namno National Biodiversity Conservation Area is a nature reserve in [[Khammouane|Khammouane Province]], [[Laos]]. This area borders [[Phong Nha-Ke Bang]] of [[Vietnam]] to the east.

The area protects the [[biodiversity]] of Laos and Southeast Asia. Hin Namno topography and geology feature [[karst]] formation. If this area and Phong Nha-Ke Bang are combined into a contiguous area, then this would be one of the largest karst region in the world.{{citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Species ==
Key species living in the reserve include Douc and Francois’s langur, giant muntjac, fruit bat, harlequin bat, great evening bat, wreathed and great hornbills and the sooty babbler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hin Namno NBCA - Ecotourism Laos|url = http://www.ecotourismlaos.com/hinnamno.htm|website = www.ecotourismlaos.com|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitats ==
Certain habitats and forestry in the reserve include evergreens, both mixed deciduous and dipterocarp forest. Due to Hin Namno being located between the Central Indochina Limestone and Annamite Chain there are many caves and limestone escarpments including a 5&amp;nbsp;km cave along the Xe Bangfai River.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/hnn_comgt_plan_eng_final_6_5_10.pdf|title = Hin Namno National Protected Area Co-Management Plan|date = |accessdate = December 1, 2015|website = |publisher = Department of Forestry, Division of Forest Resources Conservation and With Technical Assistance from IUCN Lao PDR|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IEC 61850''' is an international standard defining communication protocols for [[intelligent electronic device]]s at [[electrical substation]]s. It is a part of the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|International Electrotechnical Commission's]] (IEC) [[IEC TC 57|Technical Committee 57]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://tc57.iec.ch Technical Committee 57 (TC57)]&lt;/ref&gt; reference architecture for [[electric power]] systems. The abstract data models defined in IEC 61850 can be mapped to a number of protocols. Current mappings in the standard are to MMS ([[Manufacturing Message Specification]]), [[GOOSE]] (Generic Object Oriented Substation Event), SMV (Sampled Measured Values),{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and soon to [[Web Services]]. These protocols can run over [[TCP/IP]] networks or substation [[LAN]]s using high speed switched [[Ethernet]] to obtain the necessary response times below four milliseconds for protective relaying.

==History==
Multiple protocols exist for substation automation, which include many proprietary protocols with custom communication links. Interoperation of devices from different vendors would be an advantage to users of substation automation devices. An IEC project group of about 60 members from different countries worked in three IEC working groups from 1995. They responded to all the concerns and objectives and created IEC 61850. The objectives set for the standard were:
# A single protocol for complete substation considering modelling of different data required for substation
# Definition of basic services required to transfer data so that the entire mapping to communication protocol can be made future proof
# Promotion of high inter-operability between systems from different vendors
# A common method/format for storing complete data
# Define complete testing required for the equipment which conforms to the standard

# ''[[Data Modeling]]'' — Primary process objects as well as protection and control functionality in the substation is modelled into different standard logical nodes which can be grouped under different logical devices. There are logical nodes for data/functions related to the logical device (''LLN0'') and physical device (''LPHD'').
# ''Reporting Schemes'' — There are various reporting schemes (''BRCB &amp; URCB'') for reporting data from server through a server-client relationship which can be triggered based on pre-defined trigger conditions.
# ''Fast Transfer of events'' — [[Generic Substation Events]] (''GSE'') are defined for fast transfer of event data for a peer-to-peer communication mode. This is again subdivided into ''[[GOOSE]]'' &amp; [[Generic Substation Events#Generic Substation State Events (GSSE)|''GSSE'']].
# ''Setting Groups'' — The setting group control Blocks (''SGCB'') are defined to handle the setting groups so that user can switch to any active group according to the requirement.
# ''Sampled Data Transfer'' — Schemes are also defined to handle transfer of sampled values using Sampled Value Control blocks (''SVCB'')
# ''Commands'' — Various command types are also supported by IEC 61850 which include direct &amp; select before operate (SBO) commands with normal and enhanced securities.
# ''Data Storage'' — [[Substation Configuration Language]] (''SCL'') is defined for complete storage of configured data of the substation in a specific format.

The title of the "'''largest [[naval battle]] in history'''" is disputed between adherents of different criteria which include the numbers of personnel and/or vessels involved in the battle, and the total tonnage of the vessels involved. While battles fought in modern times are comparatively well-documented, the figures from those in pre-Renaissance times are generally believed to be exaggerated by contemporary chroniclers.

==The candidates==
* '''[[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]]''', September (28?) 480 BC. 371 [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ships defeated 300–600 [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] ships in this decisive battle. Greek [[trireme]]s had a crew of about 200 while their small [[Penteconter (ship)|penteconters]] had 50 oarsmen.
* '''[[Battle of Cape Ecnomus|Cape Ecnomus]]''', 256 BC. One of [[Roman Republic|Rome's]] first major naval victories over its rival, the city of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], in the [[First Punic War]]. The battle itself involved around 680 ships and 300,000 personnel from both sides. Total casualties were about 40,000–50,000, of which roughly 10,000 were on the Roman side and the rest from the Carthaginian side.
*'''[[Battle of Red Cliffs|Red Cliffs]]''', winter of 208 AD. A decisive naval engagement between the forces of [[Cao Cao]] and the allied forces of [[Liu Bei]] and [[Sun Quan]], this battle resulted in the defeat of Cao Cao and confirmed the separation of China into northern and southern halves, the [[Yangtze River valley|Yangtze River Valley]] as a border. Between 270,000 and 850,000 personnel participated in this battle.
*'''[[Battle of the Masts]]''', 654 AD. The Battle of the Masts, or the Battle of [[Finike]] (Phoenix), was an engagement involving the [[Byzantine Empire]], with 500 ships and led personally by Emperor [[Constans II]], and the newly formed navy of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], commanded by Admiral [[Abu'l-Awar]], with 200 ships. The Byzantines hastily attacked, resulting in a decisive victory for the Arabs. Emperor Constans II barely escaped with his life, and this battle marked the emergence of Arabs on the Mediterranean. 
* '''[[Battle of Yamen|Yamen]]''', March 19, 1279. The battle which ended the Mongol-led [[Yuan Dynasty]]'s conquest of [[Southern Song Dynasty]]. It is claimed that more than 1,000 [[Song Dynasty]] warships were destroyed by the [[Yuan Dynasty]] near Yamen, [[Guangdong]], China.
*  '''[[Battle of Lake Poyang|Lake Poyang]]''', August 30&amp;ndash;October 4, 1363. Claimed to be the largest naval battle in terms of personnel, with a reported 850,000 sailors and soldiers involved. A [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] rebel force, said to be 200,000 strong, commanded by [[Zhu Yuanzhang]], met a [[Han (people)|Han]] rebel force, claimed to be 650,000-strong, commanded by [[Chen Youliang]], on [[Lake Poyang]], China's largest freshwater lake.
* '''[[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]]''', May 31&amp;ndash;June 1, 1916. The Imperial German Navy's [[High Seas Fleet]] commanded by Vice-Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]] and the British [[Grand Fleet]] under [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Admiral Sir John Jellicoe]] engaged in battle near Jutland, Denmark during World War I. The German fleet consisted of 16 [[dreadnought]] and 6 [[Pre-dreadnought battleship|pre-dreadnought]] battleships, 5 [[Battlecruiser|battle cruisers]], 11 [[light cruiser]]s, and 61 fleet torpedo boats, while the numerically superior British fleet was composed of 28 battleships, 9 battle cruisers, 8 [[Armored cruiser|armoured cruisers]], 26 light cruisers, 78 destroyers, 1 [[minelayer]], and 1 [[Seaplane tender|seaplane carrier]]. Britain lost more ships and twice as many men as Germany, although ultimately the outcome was beneficial for the British as the battle resulted in the successful containment of the German fleet. In terms of total tonnage of ships involved, this was the largest surface battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Largest Naval Sea Battles in Military History|url=http://militaryhistory.norwich.edu/largest-naval-sea-battles-in-military-history/|website=Norwich University|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Battle of the Philippine Sea|Philippine Sea]]''', June 19–20, 1944. The largest aircraft carrier battle in history, involving fifteen U.S. [[Fleet carrier|fleet]] and [[Light aircraft carrier|light carriers]], nine Japanese carriers, 170 other warships and some 1,700 aircraft.  In terms of tonnage, the U.S. Fifth Fleet's [[Task Force 58]] is the largest single naval formation ever to give battle.
* '''[[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Leyte Gulf]]''', October 23&amp;ndash;26, 1944. The largest in terms of [[tonnage]] of ships in the combined orders of battle, if not necessarily in terms of tonnage of the ships engaged; it is also the largest in terms of the tonnage of ships sunk, and in terms of the size of the area within which the component battles took place. The [[United States]] [[U.S. Third Fleet|Third]] and [[U.S. Seventh Fleet|Seventh]] Fleets, including some [[Royal Australian Navy|Australian]] warships, comprised 8 large [[aircraft carrier]]s, 8 [[light aircraft carrier|light carriers]], 18 [[escort carrier]]s, 12 [[Battleship#World War II|battleship]]s, 24 [[cruiser]]s, 141 [[destroyer]]s and [[destroyer escort]]s, many other ships, and around 1,500 aircraft. They won a decisive victory over [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces, which consisted of 1 large [[aircraft carrier]], 3 [[light aircraft carrier|light carriers]], nine battleships, 19 cruisers, 34 destroyers and several hundred aircraft. The opposing fleets carried a total of about 200,000 personnel. Leyte Gulf consisted of four major subsidiary battles: [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of the Sibuyan Sea (24 October)|Battle of the Sibuyan Sea]], [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October)|Battle of Surigao Strait]], [[Battle of Samar]] and [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of Cape Engaño (25–26 October)|Battle of Cape Engano]], along with other actions. These are counted together by virtue of their all being caused by the Japanese operation ''Sho-Go'', which was aimed at destroying the Allied amphibious forces involved in the [[Battle of Leyte|invasion of Leyte]]. However, the individual battles were separated by distances as great as two hundred miles, as well as several days time, from the first submarine action to the Japanese withdrawal.

[[Cambridgeshire]] is a county in eastern England, with an area of {{convert|1,308|sqmi|sqkm}} and a population as of 2011 of 708,719. It is crossed by two major rivers, the [[River Nene|Nene]] and the [[River Great Ouse|Great Ouse]]. The main manufacturing area is [[Peterborough]], and the foundation of the [[University of Cambridge]] in the thirteenth century made the county one of the country's most important intellectual centres. A large part of the county is in [[The Fens]], and drainage of this habitat, which was probably commenced in the Roman period and largely completed by the seventeenth century, considerably increased the area available for agriculture.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Cambridgeshire|title=Cambridgeshire|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|year=2013|accessdate=17 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011224415/https://www.britannica.com/place/Cambridgeshire|archivedate=11 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrative county was formed in 1974, incorporating most of the historic county of [[Huntingdonshire]].&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; Local government is divided between [[Cambridgeshire County Council]] and [[Peterborough City Council]], which is a separate [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]]. Under the county council, there are five district councils, [[Cambridge City Council]], [[South Cambridgeshire District Council]], [[East Cambridgeshire District Council]], [[Huntingdonshire District Council]] and [[Fenland District Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/info/20050/council_structure/81/local_government_in_cambridgeshire|title=Local government in Cambridgeshire|publisher=Cambridgeshire County Council|accessdate=25 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819221806/http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/info/20050/council_structure/81/local_government_in_cambridgeshire|archivedate=19 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Local Nature Reserve]]s (LNRs) are designated by local authorities, which must have a legal control over the site, by owning or leasing it or having an agreement with the owner. LNRs are sites which have a special local interest either biologically, geologically or education. Local authorities can either manage sites themselves or through other groups such as "friends of" and wildlife trusts, and can apply local [[Byelaws in the United Kingdom|bye-laws]] to manage and protect LNRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/create-and-manage-local-nature-reserves|title=Local Nature Reserves: Setting up and Management|date=2 October 2014|publisher=Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs and Natural England|accessdate=17 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118052129/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/create-and-manage-local-nature-reserves|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest is [[Little Paxton Pits]] at sixty hectares, which is of national importance for wintering wildfowl,&lt;ref name=lpsssi/&gt; and the smallest is [[St Denis Church, East Hatley|St Denis Churchyard, East Hatley]], which has grassland with diverse flowers.&lt;ref name=lnrdenis/&gt; There is public access to all sites.

'''Læsø''' ("Isle of [[Ægir|Hlér]]") is the largest island in the [[North Sea]] bay of [[Kattegat]], and is located {{convert|19|km}} off the northeast coast of the [[Jutland Peninsula]], the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[mainland]]. Læsø is also the name of the municipality ([[Danish language|Danish]], ''[[Municipalities of Denmark|kommune]]'') on that island. The island is a location mentioned in several instances in [[Norse mythology]], including as the dwelling of the sea [[jötunn]] [[Ægir]] and as a feasting place of the Norse gods, the [[Æsir]].

==The Municipality of Læsø==
The municipality is in [[Region Nordjylland]] in northern [[Denmark]]. The municipality, Denmark's least populous, covers Læsø and neighboring small islands for a total area of {{convert|114|km2}}, and has a total population of 1,793 as of 1 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Danmarks_kommuner/L%C3%A6s%C3%B8_Kommune "Læsø Kommune",] ''Den store Danske''. {{Da icon}} Retrieved 28 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="statistikbanken"&gt;[http://statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1024 "Danmarks Statistik."] Retrieved 11 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The population has been steadily declining, and according to Danmarks Statistik (Statistikbanken.dk) was: 2091 inhabitants (year:2006); 2056 inh. (2007); 2003 inh. (2008);1993 inh.(2009);1969 inh. (2010);1949 inh. (2011);1897 inh. (2012);1839 inh. (2013);1808 inh. (2014);1795 inh. (2015);1817 inh. (2016);1793 inh. (2017).  Its mayor is Karsten Nielsen as of 1 January 2018. He is a member of the [[Danish People's Party]] [[Politics of Denmark|political party]].

The main town and the site of its municipal council is [[Byrum, Denmark|Byrum]].

Because Læsø is an island and lies in the [[Kattegat]], its neighboring municipality, [[Frederikshavn]] on the Jutland peninsula, is separated by water, the ''Læsø Rende'', from the island municipality.

Ferry service connects [[Frederikshavn]] on the Jutland peninsula to the municipality at the town of [[Vesterø Havn]] while [[Østerby Havn]] is the island's fishing harbour.

Læsø Municipality was not merged with any adjacent municipality under the [[Municipalities of Denmark#Municipality Reform 2007|municipal reform of 2007]], as it agreed to enter into a "municipal cooperation agreement" with [[Frederikshavn Municipality]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=10080&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature and protections==
Læsø has an outstanding botanical interest. The nature-types on and around Læsø includes open water, extensive [[mudflats]], [[sand banks]], [[heathland]], [[islet]]s and areas of arable land. It houses Denmarks largest tidal [[saltmarsh]] outside the [[Wadden Sea]] but the decline in [[grazing]] animals has led to a gradual vegetational succession. Invasive species are colonizing the site, especially [[Rosa rugosa|Japanese Rose]], and scrub clearance has been implemented to re-establish the former [[pasture]]s open heathland. Seals like the [[Harbor seal]] are breeding around Læsø and the whole area is an internationally important area for wintering, molting and staging [[waterbird]]s. Therefore, a [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] protection was put into force in 1977 (number 149) and today it encompass 66,548 ha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-documents-list-anno-denmark/main/ramsar/1-31-218%5E16427_4000_0__ The Annotated Ramsar List: Denmark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222170305/http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-documents-list-anno-denmark/main/ramsar/1-31-218%5E16427_4000_0__ |date=2014-02-22 }} Ramsar, 05.08.2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Læsø house.jpg|left|thumb|A particular feature of Læsø is its [[half-timber]]ed houses thatched with [[Zostera|eelgrass]]]]

==Climate, industry and wildlife==
Together with [[Anholt (Denmark)|Anholt]], Læsø belongs to the Danish "desert belt"; during the summer months there is so little rain that streams and ponds partly dry up.

In the [[Middle Ages]], the island was known for its [[salt]] industry. The ground water can reach over 15 percent salt, and this was naturally concentrated in flat salt meadows during the hot dry summers. The final concentration, carried out in hundreds of salt [[kiln]]s, consumed large amounts of [[wood]]. Eventually the island became deforested, sandstorms buried villages, and salt extraction was banned. Since the end of the 1980s it has been resumed on a small scale as an archaeological experiment and a tourist attraction.

Læsø is home to the bee subspecies [[European dark bee]]. The species is protected by Danish law which prohibits the import of other species to the island. The law has not been enforced and today normal bees and brown bees are both used for the production of honey. The island has been split in two parts for bee management, one for each species.

Læsø is home to unique styles of Danish traditional music. Most of it is not played any more but has been preserved through intense documentation and research in the 1980s and 1990s.

The HVDC powerline [[Kontiskan]] crosses Læsø as overhead line. On Læsø, there is also a 160 metres tall radio relay mast.

==Etymology==
Modern Danish ''Læsø'' is first attested in [[Old Norse]] as '''Hlésey''', meaning "Isle of [[Hlér]]". According to the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', ''Hlér'' is another name for the sea [[jötunn]] [[Ægir]] who, according to the same book, there held feasts for the gods.&lt;ref name="HLESEY"&gt;McKinnell (2005:110) and Faulkes (1995:59).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norse mythology==
In the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' poem ''[[Hárbarðsljóð]]'', the god [[Thor]] comments that it was on Hlésey that he was attacked by and so fought "berserk women" or "brides of [[berserker|berserks]]" who had bewitched all of the men on the island. Thor details that, upon beaching his ship, the women battered it, threatened him with iron clubs and chased his servant, [[Þjálfi and Röskva|Þjálfi]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|
:&lt;small&gt;[[Benjamin Thorpe]] translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:She-wolves they were, and scarcely women.
:They crushed my ship, which with props I had secured,
:with iron clubs threatened me, and drove away Thiâlfi.
:What meanwhile didst thou, Harbard?&lt;ref name=THORPE21&gt;Thorpe (1866:76).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
:&lt;small&gt;[[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]] translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:She-wolves they were like, and women little;
:My ship, which well I had trimmed, did they shake;
:With clubs of iron they threatened, and Thjalfi they drove off.
:What, Harbarth, didst thou the while?&lt;ref name=BELLOWS133&gt;Bellows (1923:92).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These "women" are either personified waves or [[jötunn|jötnar]]. The island is also a setting in the poems ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]'' and ''[[Oddrúnargrátr]]'', the saga ''[[Örvar-Odds saga]]'', in two [[skald]]ic [[kenning]]s, and the aforementioned (see etymology section above) ''Prose Edda'' book ''Skáldskaparmál''.&lt;ref name="MCKINELL110"&gt;McKinell (2005:110).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable residents==
Since 1992 the island has been home to the noted chef [[Mogens Bay Esbensen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stephendownes.com/?p=72|title=HugeDomains.com - StephenDownes.com is for sale (Stephen Downes)|author=|date=|website=stephendownes.com|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist [[Per Kirkeby]] owns a house and studio on the island.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1691">The '''Marathon Large Igneous Province''' is a [[Paleoproterozoic]] [[large igneous province]] along the southern [[Superior craton]] of [[Ontario]], Canada, located around the northern margin of [[Lake Superior]]. It consists of three [[diabase]] [[dike swarm]]s known as Marathon, Kapuskasing and Fort Frances. The Kapuskasing and Marathon dike swarms range in age from about 2,126&amp;nbsp;to 2,101&amp;nbsp;million years old while the Fort Frances dike swarm is between 2,076&amp;nbsp;and 2,067&amp;nbsp;million years old.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halls|first1=Henry C.|last2=Davis|first2=D.W.|last3=Stott|first3=G.M.|last4=Ernst|first4=R.E.|last5=Hamilton|first5=M.A.|title=The Paleoproterozoic Marathon Large Igneous Province: New evidence for a 2.1Ga long-lived mantle plume event along the southern margin of the North American Superior Province|journal=Precambrian Research|date=May 2008|volume=162|issue=3–4|pages=327–353|doi=10.1016/j.precamres.2007.10.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single, periodically active [[mantle plume]] was responsible for the creation of the Marathon Large Igneous Province due to the lack of apparent [[polar wander]] during the formation of the igneous province.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; The large magmatic event covers an area of at least {{Convert|400000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} and the entire large igneous province was constructed in 60&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

{{Chinese|s=崂山|t=嶗山|p=Láoshān|order=st}}

'''Mount Lao''', or '''Laoshan''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|崂|山}}|t={{linktext|嶗|山}}|p={{linktext|Láo| Shān}}}}) is a mountain located near the [[East China Sea]] on the southeastern coastline of the [[Shandong Peninsula]] in China. The mountain is culturally significant due to its long affiliation with [[Taoism]] and is often regarded as one of the "cradles of Taoism". It is the highest coastal mountain in China and the second highest mountain in Shandong, with the highest peak (Jufeng) reaching {{convert|1132.7|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sohu.com/20070428/n249760057.shtml (Chinese)崂山有了权威“身高”1132.7米 高度精确到石头尖]&lt;/ref&gt; The mountain lies about {{convert|30|km|mi}} to the northeast of the downtown area of the City of [[Qingdao]] and is protected by the Qingdao Laoshan National Park that covers an area of 446 square kilometers.

==Geology==
Mount Lao consists of [[granite]]. The mountain's landforms were formed due to the action of glaciers during the [[Quaternary]] and erosion by meltwater released from the icecap that covered a large portion of Shandong during the late [[Pleistocene]].

==History==
Laoshan is known as one of the birthplaces of [[Taoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qingdao: A City Profile|url=http://gochina.about.com/od/qingdao/a/Qingdao.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the place where the [[Quanzhen School|Complete Perfection School of Taoism]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|全|真}}|p={{linktext|Quán|zhēn}}}}) developed. In 412 CE the Chinese [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] pilgrim [[Faxian]] landed near Laoshan on his return from [[India]]. In the course of history, the mountain has been known by various other names, which includes different spellings of "Laoshan" (劳山, 牢山) as well as entirely different names such as Mount Futang and Mount Ao (鰲山). The latter name was used by the Taoist [[Qiu Chuji]] who served as the top religious affairs official to Genghis Khan.

==Sites==
In the course of history, numerous palaces, [[Taoist]] temples, and nunneries have been constructed on Mount Lao. At the peak of Taoist worship, Mount Lao was home to about 1000 monks and nuns. However, many of these structures have not survived to the present. Major sites on Mount Lao are:

===Temple of Supreme Purity===

The largest temple complex on Mount Lao is that of the Temple of Supreme Purity ({{zh|c={{linktext|太|清|宮}}|p={{linktext|Tàiqīng| Gōng}}|l=Supreme Purity Palace}}), a Taoist temple that was first built during the [[Song dynasty|Northern Song dynasty]] with the present structures dating to the reign of the [[Wanli Emperor]] in the [[Ming dynasty]]. The temple is located near the coast, below Pantao Peak on the southeastern foot of Mount Lao and is hence also known as the Lower Temple ({{zh|c={{linktext|下|宮}}|p={{linktext|Xià |Gōng}}}}), The main structure of the temple is the Hall of the Three Pure Ones ({{zh|c={{linktext|三|清|馆}}|p={{linktext|Sān|qīng |Guǎn}}}}) with houses statues of the [[Three Pure Ones|Taoist Trinity]] ([[Daode Tianzun|the Grand Pure One]], [[Lingbao Tianzun|the Supreme Pure One]], [[Yuanshi Tianzun|the Jade Pure One]]). It is flanked by the Three Emperors Hall (to the left, {{zh|c={{linktext|三|皇|馆}}|p={{linktext|Sān|huáng |Guǎn}}}}) and the Three Officials Hall (to the left, {{zh|c={{linktext|三|官|店}}|p={{linktext|Sān|guān |Diàn}}}}). The Three Emperors Hall enshrines statues of [[Fuxi]], [[Shennong]], and the [[Yellow Emperor]]. In the Three Officials Halls are the statues of the Three Gods (the God of Heaven, the God of Earth, and the God of Water) along with other statues, such as of the warrior god [[Xuan Wu (god)|Xuan Wu]] and of [[Lei Gong]], the God of Thunder. Two ancient [[Cypress]] trees in front of the Three Emperors Hall are said to have been planted during the [[Han Dynasty]]. Two old [[camellia]] trees are standing in front of the Three Officials Hall. On the walls outside of the Three Emperors Hall an imperial decree by [[Genghis Khan]] granting Daoism protection. A natural feature on the grounds of the temple is the Shenshui (Immortal Water) Spring that is fed by Mount Lao's considerable underground waters. The [[Qing dynasty]] writer [[Pu Songling]] is said to have resided in the Temple of Supreme Purity in his later years. His stories "The Taoist Priest of Laoshan" ({{zh|c={{linktext|崂|山|道|士}}|p={{linktext|Láo|shān |Dào|shì}}}}) and "The Flower Nymphs" ({{zh|c={{linktext|香|玉}}|p={{linktext|Xiāng|yù}}}}) from the collection [[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]] are set on Mount Lao with the latter story specifically referring to peonies and camellias in the Temple of Supreme Purity.

===Yakou Temple===

===Temple of Great Purity===

[[File:Shang Qing Gong of Lao shan.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the Temple of Great Purity]]
The Temple of Great Purity ({{zh|c={{linktext|上|清|宮}}|p={{linktext|Shàng|qīng| Gōng}}}}) also known as the Upper Temple ({{zh|c={{linktext|上|宮}}|p={{linktext|Shàng| Gōng}}}}) is located on the southeastern slope of Mount Lao above the Temple of Supreme Purity. It was established during the Song Dynasty and rebuilt during the Yuan Dynasty, in the years 1297 to 1307. It is one of the oldest extant structures on Mount Lao. Like the Temple of Supreme Purity, the Temple of Great Purity features a spring. The spring in the Temple of Great Purity is called the "Shengshuiyang (Ocean of Holy Water) Spring".

===Longtan Waterfall===

The Longtan Waterfall ({{zh|c={{linktext|龙|潭|瀑}}|p={{linktext|Lóng|tán| Pù}}}}) has a height of about 20 meters and is located to the south of the Temple of Great Purity.

===Temple of Supreme Peace===

The Temple of Supreme Peace ({{zh|c={{linktext|太|平|宮}}|p={{linktext|Tài|píng| Gōng}}}}) is located on the northern slope of Mount Lao. It was established during the Song Dynasty, but has been rebuilt several times.

===Hualou Temple===

The Hualou Temple ({{zh|c={{linktext|华|楼|宮}}|p={{linktext|Huá| lóu| Gōng}}}}) was established by the Daoist Liu Zhijian during the Yuan Dynasty (in 1325) and subsequently rebuilt during the Ming and Qing Dynasties, as well as during the Republican era.

===Huayan Temple===

The Huayan Temple ({{zh|c={{linktext|华|严|寺}}|p={{linktext|Huá|yán |Sì}}}}) is the only Buddhist temple on Mount Lao and is located on the eastern slope of the mountain.

==12 Sceneries==
Traditionally, 12 sceneries ({{zh|c={{linktext|崂|山|十|二|景}}|p={{linktext|Láo|shān |Shí|èr|jǐng}}}}) on Mount Lao have been regarded as particularly beautiful:

# Mingxia Sanyi (明霞散绮, rays of sunshine)
# Weizhu Mingquan (尉竹鸣泉, spring with sound)
# Yundong Pansong (云洞蟠松, pine tree on the rock)
# Yanpu Chaoyin (岩瀑潮音, waterfall with sound of tide)
# Qipan Xian Yi (棋盘仙弈, megalith at Qipan)
# Hualou Dieshi (华楼叠石, various stones)
# Shiling Hengyun (狮岭横云, clouds hung on the top of the peak)
# Naluoyanku (那罗延窟, rock cave)
# Haiqiao Xiandun (海峤仙墩, seaside cliffs)
# Taiqing Suiyue (太清水月, bright moon in spring water of Taiqing Palace)
# Longtan Penyu (龙潭喷雨, water flowing out of the dragon pool)
# Jufeng Xuzhao (巨峰旭照, rising sun in the morning on the highest peak)

==Culture==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Wang lang.JPG|thumb|140px|left|Wang Lang monument, of [[Northern Praying Mantis (martial art)|Northern Praying Mantis]] boxing.]] --&gt;

Mount Lao is featured in many legends and local traditions.  For example, the mountain is said to have been visited by the emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] and [[Emperor Wu of Han]], both hoping to meet immortals and gain immortality there.

The martial arts style of the [[Northern Praying Mantis (martial art)|Northern Praying Mantis]] is attributed to Wang Lang, who is said to have developed while living on Mount Lao. Wang Lang is commemorated by a contemporary stone statue on the mountain.

Many gamblers visit Mount Lao for the famous tree located in the mountain, as it is said that three pats of the tree's trunk will bring instant luck for those seeking money.

The beer of the [[Tsingtao Brewery]] is brewed with Laoshan spring water.

Mount Lao is also famous for its green tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/131Kaleidoscope298.html|title=Qingdao Laoshan Tea|publisher=Cultural China|accessdate=|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
Laoshan is a popular tourist site with a 5A government rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=旅游名录－5A级景区|url=http://www.cnta.gov.cn:8000/forms/travelcatalog/travelcataloglist.aspx?catalogtype=view&amp;resulttype=5a|work=China National Tourism Administration|publisher=China National Tourism Administration|accessdate=22 May 2013|author=China National Tourism Administration|page=6|year=2011|quote=景点名称：山东青岛崂山景区 所属地区：山东 A级：5A 年度：2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714172658/http://www.cnta.gov.cn:8000/Forms/TravelCatalog/TravelCatalogList.aspx?catalogType=view&amp;resultType=5A|archivedate=14 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2012 [[Golden Week (China)|Golden Week]], it received about 176,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=zh:雙節期間嶗山風景區接待遊客17.6萬人次|url=http://big5.chinanews.com:89/gate/big5/qd.chinanews.com/xinwen/qdnews/201210/1015089.html|accessdate=22 May 2013|date=2012-10-10|author=張曜啟|agency=China News Service|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130731060349/http://big5.chinanews.com:89/gate/big5/qd.chinanews.com/xinwen/qdnews/201210/1015089.html|archivedate=31 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are six designated scenic areas on Mount Lao: Taiqing (太清景区), Chessboard Stone (棋盘石景区, Yangkou（仰口景区), Jufeng (巨峰景区), Beijiushui (北九水景区), and Hualou (华楼景区).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qdlaoshan.cn/en/ScenicSpot.html|title=Qingdao Laoshan Scenic Spot|publisher=Qingdao Laoshan Scenic Spot Administration|accessdate=22 May 2013|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NOAA-20''', designated '''JPSS-1''' prior to launch, is the first of the United States [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s latest generation of U.S. polar-orbiting, non-geosynchronous, environmental satellites called the [[Joint Polar Satellite System]]. NOAA-20 was launched on November 18, 2017 and joined the [[Suomi NPP|Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership]] satellite in the same orbit. NOAA-20 operates about 50 minutes ahead of Suomi NPP, allowing important overlap in observational coverage. Circling the Earth from pole-to-pole, it crosses the equator about 14 times daily, providing full global coverage twice a day. This will give meteorologists information on "atmospheric temperature and moisture, clouds, sea-surface temperature, ocean color, sea ice cover, volcanic ash, and fire detection" so as to enhance weather forecasting including hurricane tracking, post-hurricane recovery by detailing storm damage and mapping of power outages.&lt;ref name="launch"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Russell|first1=Kendall|title=Next-Gen Weather Satellite JPSS 1 Readies for Launch|url=http://www.satellitetoday.com/government/2017/10/27/next-gen-weather-satellite-jpss-1-readies-launch/|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project incorporates five instruments, and these are substantially upgraded since previous satellite equipment. The project's greater-detailed observations will provide better predictions and emphasize climate behavior in cases like El Niño and La Nina.&lt;ref name="launch"/&gt;

The project's satellite bus and Ozone Mapping and Profiler equipment, was designed by Ball Aerospace. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite and the Common Ground System were built by Raytheon, and the Cross-track Infrared Sounder was by Harris. The Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder and the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System instrument were built by Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems.&lt;ref name="launch"/&gt;

== Launch ==
The NOAA-20 launch was delayed several times. When the contract was awarded in 2010, launch was scheduled for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cole|first1=Steve|title=NASA Awards Contract For JPSS-1 Spacecraft|url=https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/sep/HQ_C10-058_JPSS-1_Spacecraft.html|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, launch had slipped to 2016, and by 2012 that had slipped to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BALL AEROSPACE MAKES PROGRESS FOR NASA'S JOINT POLAR SATELLITE SYSTEM-1 SPACECRAFT|url=http://www.ball.com/aerospace/newsroom/detail?newsid=123384|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BALL AEROSPACE INCORPORATES ENHANCED DATA COMMUNICATION FOR JPSS-1 SATELLITE|url=http://www.ball.com/aerospace/newsroom/detail?newsid=123282|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, following environmental testing, launch slipped from January 20, 2017 to March 16, 2017 due to problems with ATMS and the ground system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foust|first1=Jeff|title=Instrument, ground systems problems blamed for JPSS-1 launch delay|url=http://spacenews.com/instrument-ground-systems-problems-blamed-for-jpss-1-launch-delay/|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, launch was delayed from March 2017 to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, or July to September for the same reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foust|first1=Jeff|title=JPSS-1 launch date slips again|url=http://spacenews.com/jpss-1-launch-date-slips-again/|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch was delayed from September 2017 to November 10, 2017 to provide extra time for engineers to complete testing of the spacecraft and electronics as well as the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Marcia|title=JPSS-1 now scheduled for launch in November|url=https://spacepolicyonline.com/news/jpss-1-now-scheduled-for-launch-in-november/|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also experienced several brief launch delays in the final weeks before launch. Originally scheduled to launch on November 10, 2017, it was delayed to the 14th following the discovery of a faulty battery on the [[Delta 2]] launch vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foust|first1=Jeff|title=Battery problem delays JPSS-1 launch|url=http://spacenews.com/battery-problem-delays-jpss-1-launch/|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch was then delayed to November 15, 2017 due to boats being in the launch safety zone minutes before the launch and due to a bad reading on the first stage of the launch vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewin|first1=Sarah|title=Rocket Issue Delays Launch of Advanced New JPSS-1 Weather Satellite|url=https://www.space.com/38770-rocket-glitch-delays-jpss1-weather-satellite-launch.html|website=Space.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was delayed a 3rd time to November 18 due to high winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malik|first1=Tariq|title=High Winds Delay Launch of Advanced Weather Satellite JPSS-1|url=https://www.space.com/38795-high-winds-delay-jpss-1-weather-satellite-launch.html|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was launched along with 5 CubeSats that conducted research in "3D-printed polymers for in-space manufacturing, weather data collection, bit flip memory testing, radar calibration and the effects of space radiation on electronic components".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ray|first=Justin|title=NASA gives the Delta 2 rocket a new lease on life |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1207/16delta2/|publisher=SpaceFlightNow|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between Nov 29, 2017, when ATMS produced its "first light" image and Jan 5, 2018 when VIIRS and [[OMPS]] produced theirs, the satellite went through activation, outgassing and decontamination on the path to operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NOAA-20 First Light Images|url=https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/jpss/N20_FirstLight_Images.php|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite]] (VIIRS): takes global visible and infrared observations of land, ocean, and atmosphere parameters at high temporal resolution. Developed from the [[MODIS]] instrument flown on the Aqua and Terra [[Earth Observing System]] satellites, it has significantly better performance than the [[AVHRR]] radiometer previously flown on NOAA satellites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jointmission.gsfc.nasa.gov/viirs.html "The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite."] ''NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center.'' Retrieved: 22 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 
;Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS): will produce high-resolution, three-dimensional temperature, pressure, and moisture profiles. These profiles will be used to enhance weather forecasting models, and will facilitate both short- and long-term weather forecasting. Over longer timescales, they will help improve understanding of climate phenomena such as [[El Niño]] and [[La Niña]]. This is a brand-new instrument with breakthrough performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jointmission.gsfc.nasa.gov/cris.html "The Cross-track Infrared Sounder."] ''NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center.'' Retrieved: 22 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; CrIS represents a significant enhancement over NOAA's legacy infrared sounder—High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounders (HIRS) and is meant to be a counterpart to the [[Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer]] (IASI).
;Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS): a cross-track scanner with 22 channels, provides sounding observations needed to retrieve atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles for civilian operational weather forecasting as well as continuity of these measurements for climate monitoring purposes. It is a lighter-weight version of the previous [[Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit|AMSU]] and [[Microwave Humidity Sounder|MHS]] instruments flown on previous NOAA and NASA satellites with no new performance capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jointmission.gsfc.nasa.gov/atms.html The Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder] ''NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center.'' Retrieved: 22 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite]] (OMPS): an advanced suite of three [[hyperspectral]] instruments, extends the 25-plus year total-ozone and ozone-profile records. These records are used by ozone-assessment researchers and policy makers to track the health of the ozone layer. The improved vertical resolution of OMPS data products allows for better testing and monitoring of the complex chemistry involved in ozone destruction near the troposphere. OMPS products, when combined with cloud predictions, also help produce better ultraviolet index forecasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jointmission.gsfc.nasa.gov/omps.html "Ozone Mapper Profiler Suite."] ''NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center.'' Retrieved: 22 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; OMPS carries on a long tradition of space borne measurements of ozone beginning in 1970 with the Nimbus 4 satellite and continuing with the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV and SBUV/2), [[Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer]] (TOMS) and [[Ozone Monitoring Instrument]] (OMI) instruments on various NASA, NOAA, and international satellites. Over the more than 30-year period in which these instruments have been operating, they have provided a very detailed and important long-term record of the global distribution of ozone.
;[[Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System]] (CERES): senses both solar-reflected and Earth-emitted radiation from the top of the atmosphere to the Earth's surface. Cloud properties are determined using simultaneous measurements by other JPSS instruments such as the VIIRS and will lead to a better understanding of the role of clouds and the energy cycle in global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/ "Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System."] ''NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center.''

[[File:Phase Angle 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Phase angle diagram]]

'''Phase angle''' in [[Observational astronomy|astronomical observation]]s is the angle between the light incident onto an observed [[Astronomical object|object]] and the light reflected from the object. In the context of astronomical observations, this is usually the angle [[Sun]]-object-observer.

For terrestrial observations, "Sun–object–Earth" is often nearly the same thing as "Sun–object–observer", since the difference depends on the [[parallax]], which in the case of observations of the [[Moon]] can be as much as 1°, or two full Moon diameters. With the development of [[Spaceflight|space travel]], as well as in hypothetical observations from other points in space, the notion of phase angle became independent of Sun and Earth.

The [[etymology]] of the term is related to the notion of [[planetary phase]]s, since the [[brightness]] of an object and its appearance as a "phase" is the function of the phase angle.

The phase angle varies from 0° to 180°. The value of 0° corresponds to the position where the illuminator, the observer, and the object are collinear, with the illuminator and the observer on the same side of the object. This is known as [[astronomical opposition]]. The value of 180° is the position where the object is between the illuminator and the observer. Values less than 90° represent [[backscatter]]ing; values greater than 90° represent [[forward scatter]]ing.

For some objects, such as the [[Moon]] (see [[lunar phases]]), [[Venus]] and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] the phase angle (as seen from the Earth) covers the full 0&amp;ndash;180° range. The [[superior planet]]s cover shorter ranges. For example, for [[Mars]] the maximum phase angle is about 45°.

The brightness of an object is a function of the phase angle, which is generally smooth, except for the so-called [[opposition spike]] near 0°, which does not affect gas giants or bodies with pronounced atmospheres, and when the object becomes fainter as the angle approaches 180°. This relationship is referred to as the [[Phase curve (astronomy)|phase curve]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="65961">'''Photogeochemistry''' merges [[photochemistry]] and [[geochemistry]] into the study of light-induced chemical reactions that occur or may occur among natural components of Earth's surface. The first comprehensive review on the subject was published in 2017 by the chemist and soil scientist Timothy A Doane,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 5307419 | pmid=28246525 | doi=10.1186/s12932-017-0039-y | volume=18 | title=A survey of photogeochemistry | journal=Geochem Trans | page=1 | last1 = Doane | first1 = TA | year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term photogeochemistry appeared a few years earlier as a keyword in studies that described the role of light-induced mineral transformations in shaping the [[biogeochemistry]] of Earth;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = J.

== The domain of photogeochemistry ==
The context of a photogeochemical reaction is implicitly the surface of Earth, since that is where [[sunlight]] is available (although other sources of light such as [[chemiluminescence]] would not be strictly excluded from photogeochemical study). Reactions may occur among components of land such as [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[soil]] and [[detritus]]; components of [[surface water]] such as sediment and dissolved organic matter; and components of the [[Planetary boundary layer|atmospheric boundary layer]] directly influenced by contact with land or water, such as mineral [[aerosol]]s and gases. [[Visible spectrum|Visible]] and medium- to long-wave [[ultraviolet]] radiation is the main source of energy for photogeochemical reactions; wavelengths of light shorter than about 290&amp;nbsp;nm are completely absorbed by the present atmosphere,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Pharmaceutical Journal and Transactions|publisher = Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain|year = 1881|isbn = |location = |pages = 227|volume = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Development and evaluation of chemical actinometers|last = Dulin|first = David|date = 1982|journal = Environmental Science and Technology|doi = 10.1021/es00105a017|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Mill|first2 = Theodore|issue = |volume = 16|pages = 815–820|bibcode = 1982EnST...16..815D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics: From Air Pollution to Climate Change|last = Seinfield|first = J.H.|publisher = Wiley|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Pandis|first2 = S.N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore practically irrelevant, except in consideration of atmospheres different from that of Earth today.

Photogeochemical reactions are limited to chemical reactions not facilitated by living organisms. The reactions comprising [[photosynthesis]] in plants and other organisms, for example, are not considered photogeochemistry, since the physiochemical context for these reactions is installed by the organism, and must be maintained in order for these reactions to continue (i.e. the reactions cease if the organism dies). In contrast, if a certain compound is produced by an organism, and the organism dies but the compound remains, this compound may still participate independently in a photogeochemical reaction even though its origin is biological (e.g. biogenic mineral precipitates&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Biogeochemical properties of bacteriogenic iron oxides|last = Ferris|first = F.G.|date = 2005|journal = Geomicrobiology Journal|doi = 10.1080/01490450590945861|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 22|pages = 79–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Bacteriogenic manganese oxides|last = Spiro|first = T.G.|date = 2010|journal = Accounts of Chemical Research|doi = 10.1021/ar800232a|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Bargar|first2 = J.R.|last3 = Sposito|first3 = G|last4 = Tebo|first4 = B.M.|volume = 43|pages = 2–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; or organic compounds released from plants into water&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Aquatic Ecosystems: Interactivity of Dissolved Organic Matter|publisher = Academic Press|year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The study of photogeochemistry is primarily concerned with naturally occurring materials, but may extend to include other materials, inasmuch as they are representative of, or bear some relation to, those found on Earth. For example, many inorganic compounds have been synthesized in the laboratory to study [[Photocatalysis|photocatalytic]] reactions. Although these studies are usually not undertaken in the context of [[Environmental science|environmental]] or [[Earth science]]s, the study of such reactions is relevant to photogeochemistry if there is a geochemical implication (i.e. similar reactants or reaction mechanisms occur naturally). Similarly, photogeochemistry may also include photochemical reactions of naturally occurring materials that are not touched by sunlight, if there is the possibility that these materials may become exposed (e.g. deep soil layers uncovered by mining).

Photogeochemical research, however, may be set apart in light of its specific context and implications, thereby bringing more exposure to this "poorly explored area of experimental geochemistry".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Past studies that fit the definition of photogeochemistry may be designated retroactively as such.

== Early photogeochemistry ==

The first efforts that can be considered photogeochemical research can be traced to the "formaldehyde hypothesis" of [[Adolf von Baeyer]] in 1870,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Ueber die Wasserentziehung und ihre Bedeutung fur das Pflanzenleben unt die Gahrung|last = von Baeyer|first = A|date = 1870|journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft|doi = 10.1002/cber.18700030123|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 3|pages = 63–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[formaldehyde]] was proposed to be the initial product of plant photosynthesis, formed from carbon dioxide and water through the action of light on a green leaf. This suggestion inspired numerous attempts to obtain formaldehyde ''in vitro'', which can retroactively be considered photogeochemical studies. Detection of organic compounds such as formaldehyde and sugars was reported by many workers, usually by exposure of a solution of carbon dioxide to light, typically a mercury lamp or sunlight itself. At the same time, many other workers reported negative results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Photosynthesis in tropical sunlight.

Some experiments included reducing agents such as hydrogen gas,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Synthese photochimique des hydrates de carbone aux depens des elements de l'anhydride carbonique et de la vapeur d'eau, en l'absence de chlorophylle; synthese photochimique des composes quaternaires|last = Berthelot|first = D|date = 1910|journal = Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Gaudechon|first2 = H|volume = 150|pages = 1690–1693}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others detected formaldeyhde or other products in the absence of any additives,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The mechanism of carbon assimilation: Part III|last = Usher|first = F.L.|date = 1911|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|doi = 10.1098/rspb.1911.0052|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Priestley|first2 = J.H.|volume = 84|pages = 101–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  although the possibility was admitted that reducing power may have been produced from the decomposition of water during the experiment.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; In addition to the main focus on synthesis of formaldehyde and simple sugars, other light-assisted reactions were occasionally reported, such as the decomposition of formaldehyde and subsequent release of [[methane]], or the formation of [[formamide]] from carbon monoxide and ammonia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1912 Benjamin Moore summarized the main facet of photogeochemistry, that of inorganic [[photocatalysis]]: "the inorganic colloid must possess the property of transforming sunlight, or some other form of radiant energy, into chemical energy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Origin and Nature of Life|last = Moore|first = Benjamin|publisher = Williams and Norgate|year = 1912|isbn = |location = |pages = 182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many experiments, still focused on how plants assimilate carbon, did indeed explore the effect of a "transformer" (catalyst); some effective "transformers" were similar to naturally occurring minerals, including iron(III) oxide or colloidal iron hydroxide;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Photosynthesis in tropical sunlight.

At this time, however, the intricate details of plant photosynthesis were still obscure, and the nature of photocatalysis in general was still actively being discovered; Mackinney in 1932 stated that "the status of this problem [photochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction] is extraordinarily involved."&lt;ref name=":21"/&gt;  As in many emerging fields, experiments were largely empirical, but the enthusiasm surrounding this early work did lead to significant advances in photochemistry. The simple but challenging principle of transforming solar energy into chemical energy capable of performing a desired reaction remains the basis of application-based photocatalysis, most notably [[artificial photosynthesis]] (production of [[solar fuel]]s).

After several decades of experiments centered around the reduction of carbon dioxide, interest began to spread to other light-induced reactions involving naturally occurring materials. These experiments usually focused on reactions analogous to known biological processes, such as soil [[nitrification]],&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dhar | first1 = NR | last2 = Bhattacharya | first2 = AK | last3 = Biswas | first3 = NN | year = 1932 | title = Photonitrification in soil | url = | journal = Soil Science | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 281–284 | doi=10.1097/00010694-193304000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which the photochemical counterpart "photonitrification" was first reported in 1930.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Classifying photogeochemical reactions ==
Photogeochemical reactions may be classified based on thermodynamics and/or the nature of the materials involved. In addition, when ambiguity exists regarding an analogous reaction involving light and living organisms ([[phototroph]]y), the term "photochemical" may be used to distinguish a particular abiotic reaction from the corresponding photobiological reaction. For example, "photooxidation of iron(II)" can refer to either a biological process driven by light (phototrophic or photobiological iron oxidation)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hegler | first1 = F | last2 = Posth | first2 = NR | last3 = Jiang | first3 = J | last4 = Kappler | first4 = A | year = 2008 | title = Physiology of phototrophic iron(II)-oxidizing bacteria: implications for modern and ancient environments | url = | journal = FEMS Microbiology Ecology | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 250–260 | doi=10.1111/j.1574-6941.2008.00592.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a strictly chemical, abiotic process (photochemical iron oxidation). Similarly, an abiotic process that converts water to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under the action of light may be designated "photochemical oxidation of water" rather than simply  "photooxidation of water", in order to distinguish it from photobiological oxidation of water potentially occurring in the same environment (by algae, for example).

=== Thermodynamics  ===
Photogeochemical reactions are described by the same principles used to describe photochemical reactions in general, and may be classified similarly:
# Photosynthesis: in the most general sense, photosynthesis refers to any light-activated reaction for which the change in [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] (ΔG&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;) is positive for the reaction itself (without considering the presence of a catalyst or light).  The products have higher energy than the reactants, and therefore the reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable, except through the action of light in conjunction with a catalyst.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = An overview of semiconductor photocatalysis|last = Mills|first = A|date = 1997|journal = Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A|doi = 10.1016/s1010-6030(97)00118-4|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Le Hunte|first2 = S|volume = 108|pages = 1–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of photosynthetic reactions include the splitting of water to form H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the reaction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water to form O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and reduced carbon compounds such as methanol and methane, and the reaction of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with water to yield NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
# Photocatalysis: this refers to reactions that are accelerated by the presence of a catalyst (the light itself is not the catalyst as may be erroneously implied). The overall reaction has a negative change in free energy, and is therefore thermodynamically favored.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; Examples of photocatalytic reactions include the reaction of organic compounds with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water, and the reaction of organic compounds with water to give H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
# Uncatalyzed photoreactions: photoinduced or photoactivated reactions proceed via the action of light alone. For example, [[photodegradation]] of organic compounds often proceeds without a catalyst if the reactants themselves absorb light.

=== Nature of reactants ===
Any reaction in the domain of photogeochemistry, either observed in the environment or studied in the laboratory, may be broadly classified according to the nature of the materials involved.
# Reactions among naturally occurring compounds. Photogeochemistry, both observational and exploratory, is concerned with reactions among materials known to occur naturally, as this reflects what happens or may happen on Earth.  
# Reactions in which one or more of the reactants are not known to occur naturally. Studies of reactions among materials related to naturally occurring materials may contribute to understanding of natural processes. These complementary studies are relevant to photogeochemistry in that they illustrate reactions that may have a natural counterpart. For example, it has been shown that soils, when irradiated, can generate [[reactive oxygen species]]&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gohre | first1 = K | last2 = Miller | first2 = GC | year = 1983 | title = Singlet oxygen generation on soil surfaces | url = | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 1104–1108 | doi=10.1021/jf00119a044}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[clay minerals]] present in soils can accelerate the degradation of synthetic chemicals;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Katagi | first1 = T | year = 1990 | title = Photoinduced oxidation of the organophosphorus fungicide tolclofos-methyl on clay minerals | url = | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 1595–1600 | doi=10.1021/jf00097a035}}&lt;/ref&gt; it may therefore be postulated that naturally occurring compounds are similarly affected by sunlight acting on soil. The conversion of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has been observed upon irradiation in the presence of the iron titanate Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Nitrogen photofixation on nanostructured iron titanate films|last = Rusina|first = O.|date = 2003|journal = Chemistry: A European Journal|doi = 10.1002/chem.200390059|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Linnik|first2 = O|last3 = Eremenko|first3 = A|last4 = Kisch|first4 = H|volume = 9|pages = 561–565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Linnik | first1 = O | last2 = Kisch | first2 = H | year = 2006 | title = On the mechanism of nitrogen photofixation at nanostructured iron titanate films | url = | journal = Photochemical and Photobiological Sciences | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 938–942 | doi=10.1039/b608396j}}&lt;/ref&gt; While such a compound is not known to occur naturally, it is related to [[ilmenite]] (FeTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[pseudobrookite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), and can form upon heating of ilmenite;&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gupta | first1 = SK | last2 = Rajakumar | first2 = V | last3 = Grieveson | first3 = P | year = 1991 | title = Phase transformations during heating of ilmenite concentrates | url = | journal = Metallurgical Transactions B - Process Metallurgy | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 711–716 | doi=10.1007/bf02679027| bibcode = 1991MTB....22..711G }}&lt;/ref&gt; this may imply a similar reaction with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the naturally occurring minerals.

== Photogeochemical catalysts ==

=== Direct catalysts ===
Direct photogeochemical catalysts act by absorbing light and subsequently transferring energy to reactants.

==== Semiconducting minerals ====
The majority of observed photogeochemical reactions involve a [[mineral]] catalyst. Many naturally occurring minerals are [[semiconductor]]s that absorb some portion of solar radiation.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = Y | last2 = Schoonen | first2 = MAA | year = 2000 | title = The absolute energy positions of conduction and valence bands of selected semiconducting minerals | url = | journal = American Mineralogist | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 543–556 | doi=10.2138/am-2000-0416| bibcode = 2000AmMin..85..543X }}&lt;/ref&gt; These semiconducting minerals are frequently [[transition metal]] oxides and sulfides and include abundant, well-known minerals such as hematite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), magnetite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), goethite and lepidocrocite (FeOOH), and pyrolusite (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Radiation of energy equal to or greater than the [[band gap]] of a semiconductor is sufficient to excite an electron from the valence band to a higher energy level in the conduction band, leaving behind an electron hole (h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;); the resulting electron-hole pair is called an [[exciton]]. The excited electron and hole can reduce and oxidize, respectively, species having suitable redox potentials relative to the potentials of the valence and conduction bands. Semiconducting minerals with appropriate band gaps and appropriate band energy levels can catalyze a vast array of reactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Semiconductor photocatalysis: principles and applications|last = Kisch|first = Horst|publisher = Wiley|year = 2015|isbn = 978-3-527-33553-4|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; most commonly at mineral-water or mineral-gas interfaces.

==== Organic compounds ====
Organic compounds such as "bio-organic substances"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gomis | first1 = J | last2 = Vercher | first2 = RF | last3 = Amat | first3 = AM | last4 = Martire | first4 = DO | last5 = Gonzalez | first5 = MC | last6 = Bianco Prevot | first6 = A | last7 = Montoneri | first7 = E | last8 = Arques | first8 = A | last9 = Carlos | first9 = L | year = 2013 | title = Application of soluble bio-organic substances (SBO) as photocatalysts for wastewater treatment: sensitizing effect and photo-Fenton-like process | url = | journal = Catalysis Today | volume = 209 | issue = | pages = 176–180 | doi=10.1016/j.cattod.2012.08.036}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Humic acid|humic substances]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Curtis | first1 = TP | last2 = Mara | first2 = DD | last3 = Silva | first3 = SA | year = 1992 | title = Influence of pH, oxygen, and humic substances on ability of sunlight to damage fecal coliforms in waste stabilization pond water | url = | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 1335–1343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Selli | first1 = E | last2 = De Giorgi | first2 = A | last3 = Bidoglio | first3 = G | year = 1996 | title = Humic acid-sensitized photoreduction of Cr(VI) on ZnO particles | url = | journal = Environmental Science and Technology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 598–604 | doi=10.1021/es950368+| bibcode = 1996EnST...30..598S }}&lt;/ref&gt; are also able to absorb light and act as catalysts or sensitizers, accelerating photoreactions that normally occur slowly or facilitating reactions that might not normally occur at all.

=== Indirect catalysts ===
Some materials, such as certain [[silicate minerals]], absorb little or no solar radiation, but may still participate in light-driven reactions by mechanisms other than direct transfer of energy to reactants.

==== Production of reactive species ====
Indirect photocatalysis may occur via the production of a reactive species which then participates in another reaction. For example, photodegradation of certain compounds has been observed in the presence of kaolinite and montmorillonite, and this may proceed via the formation of [[reactive oxygen species]] at the surface of these clay minerals.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Indeed, reactive oxygen species have been observed when soil surfaces are exposed to sunlight.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Georgiou | first1 = CD | display-authors = etal   | year = 2015 | title = Evidence for photochemical production of reactive oxygen species in desert soils | url = | journal = Nature Communications | volume =  6| issue = | pages =  7100| doi = 10.1038/ncomms8100 | pmid=25960012| bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E7100G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of irradiated soil to generate singlet oxygen was found to be independent of the organic matter content, and both the mineral and organic components of soil appear to contribute to this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gohre | first1 = K | last2 = Scholl | first2 = R | last3 = Miller | first3 = GC | year = 1986 | title = Singlet oxygen reactions on irradiated soil surfaces | url = | journal = Environmental Science and Technology | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 934–938 | doi=10.1021/es00151a013| bibcode = 1986EnST...20..934G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect photolysis in soil has been observed to occur at depths of up to 2&amp;nbsp;mm due to migration of reactive species; in contrast, direct photolysis (in which the degraded compound itself absorbs light) was restricted to a "photic depth" of 0.2 to 0.4&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hebert | first1 = VR | last2 = Miller | first2 = GC | year = 1990 | title = Depth dependence of direct and indirect photolysis on soil surfaces | url = | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 913–918 | doi=10.1021/jf00093a069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like certain minerals, organic matter in solution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coelho | first1 = C | last2 = Guyot | first2 = G | last3 = ter Halle | first3 = A | last4 = Cavani | first4 = L | last5 = Ciavatta | first5 = C | last6 = Richard | first6 = C | year = 2011 | title = Photoreactivity of humic substances: relationship between fluorescence and singlet oxygen production | url = | journal = Environmental Chemistry Letters | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 447–451 | doi=10.1007/s10311-010-0301-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glaeser | first1 = SP | last2 = Berghoff | first2 = BA | last3 = Stratmann | first3 = V | last4 = Grossart | first4 = HP | last5 = Glaeser | first5 = J | year = 2014 | title = Contrasting effects of singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide on bacterial community composition in a humic lake | journal = PLOS ONE | volume =  9| issue = | pages =  e92518| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0092518 | pmid=24667441 | pmc=3965437| bibcode = 2014PLoSO...992518G }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as particulate organic matter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Appiani | first1 = E | last2 = McNeill | first2 = K | year = 2015 | title = Photochemical production of singlet oxygen from particulate organic matter | url = | journal = Environmental Science and Technology | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 3514–3522 | doi=10.1021/es505712e| bibcode = 2015EnST...49.3514A }}&lt;/ref&gt; may act as an indirect catalyst via formation of singlet oxygen which then reacts with other compounds.

==== Surface sensitization ====
Indirect catalysts may also act through surface sensitization of reactants, by which species sorbed to a surface become more susceptible to photodegradation.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ausloos | first1 = P | last2 = Rebbert | first2 = RE | last3 = Glasgow | first3 = L | year = 1977 | title = Photodecomposition of chloromethanes absorbed on silica surfaces | url = | journal = Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards | volume = 82 | issue = | page = 1 | doi=10.6028/jres.082.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== True catalysis ===
Strictly speaking, the term "catalysis" should not be used unless it can be shown that the number of product molecules produced per number of active sites is greater than one; this is difficult to do in practice, although it is often assumed to be true if there is no loss in the photoactivity of the catalyst for an extended period of time.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; Reactions that are not strictly catalytic may be designated "assisted photoreactions".&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; Furthermore, phenomena that involve complex mixtures of compounds (e.g. soil) may be hard to classify unless complete reactions (not just individual reactants or products) can be identified.

== Experimental approaches ==
The great majority of photogeochemical research is performed in the laboratory, as it is easier to demonstrate and observe a particular reaction under controlled conditions. This includes confirming the identity of materials, designing reaction vessels, controlling light sources, and adjusting the reaction atmosphere. However, observation of natural phenomena often provides initial inspiration for further study. For example, during the 1970s it was generally agreed that nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) has a short residence time in the troposphere, although the actual explanation for its removal was unknown. Since N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O does not absorb light at wavelengths greater than 280&amp;nbsp;nm, direct photolysis had been discarded as a possible explanation. It was then observed that light would decompose chloromethanes when they were absorbed on silica sand,&lt;ref name=":18"/&gt; and this occurred at wavelengths far above the absorption spectra for these compounds. The same phenomenon was observed for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, leading to the conclusion that particulate matter in the atmosphere is responsible for the destruction of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O via surface-sensitized photolysis.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Decomposition of N2O over particulate matter|last = Rebbert|first = R.E.|date = 1978|journal = Geophysical Research Letters|doi = 10.1029/gl005i009p00761|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Ausloos|first2 = P|volume = 5|pages = 761–764 |bibcode=1978GeoRL...5..761R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the idea of such a sink for atmospheric N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O was supported by several reports of low concentrations of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in the air above deserts, where there is a high amount of suspended particulate matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pierotti | first1 = D | last2 = Rasmussen | first2 = LE | last3 = Rasmussen | first3 = RA | year = 1978 | title = The Sahara as a possible sink for trace gases | url = | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 1001–1004 | doi=10.1029/gl005i012p01001 | bibcode=1978GeoRL...5.1001P}}&lt;/ref&gt; As another example, the observation that the amount of nitrous acid in the atmosphere greatly increases during the day lead to insight into the surface photochemistry of humic acids and soils and an explanation for the original observation.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stemmler | first1 = K | last2 = Ammann | first2 = M | last3 = Donders | first3 = C | last4 = Kleffmann | first4 = J | last5 = George | first5 = C | year = 2006 | title = Photosensitized reduction of nitrogen dioxide on humic acid as a source of nitrous acid | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 440 | issue = | pages = 195–198 | doi=10.1038/nature04603 | pmid=16525469| bibcode = 2006Natur.440..195S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Photogeochemical reactions ==
The following table lists some reported reactions that are relevant to photogeochemical study, including reactions that involve only naturally occurring compounds as well as complementary reactions that involve synthetic but related compounds.  The selection of reactions and references given is merely illustrative and may not exhaustively reflect current knowledge, especially in the case of popular reactions such as nitrogen photofixation for which there is a large body of literature. Furthermore, although these reactions have natural counterparts, the probability of encountering optimal reaction conditions may be low in some cases; for example, most experimental work concerning CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction is intentionally performed in the absence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, since O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; almost always suppresses the reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In natural systems, however, it is uncommon to find an analogous context where CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a catalyst are reached by light but there is no O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; present.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8347">[[File:Racal Space Suits.JPG|thumb|Racal suits used at the [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]]]]

A '''racal suit''' (also known as '''racal space suit''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Racal space suit|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Racal+space+suit|website=McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a protective suit with [[powered air-purifying respirator]] (PAPR). It consists of a plastic suit and a battery-operated blower with [[HEPA filter]]s that supplied filtered air to a positive-pressure hood (also known as '''racal hood'''). Racal suits were among the protective suits used by [[Aeromedical Isolation Team]] (AIT) to [[medical evacuation|evacuate]] patients with highly [[infectious disease]]s for treatment.&lt;ref name=hearing&gt;{{cite journal|title=The threat to the United States from Emerging Infectious Diseases, Hearing before the Committee on International Relations, House of Representatives|url=http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/intlrel/hfa46765.000/hfa46765_0f.htm|date=30 July 1997|page=9|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sidell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sidell|first1=Frederick R.|last2=Takafuji|first2=Ernest T.|last3=Franz|first3=David R., D.V.M.|title=Medical Aspects of Chemical and Biological Warfare|date=1997|publisher=Office of The Surgeon General Department of the Army, United States of America|url=http://www.sc-ems.com/ems/NuclearBiologicalChemical/MedicalAspectsofNBC/chapters/chapter_19.htm|accessdate=15 April 2015|chapter=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
[[File:Aeromedical isolation team members in field-protective suits.jpg|thumb|right|Details of the suit components]]

===Protective suit===
The main body of the protective suit consists of a lightweight [[coverall]] made of [[polyvinyl chloride]], rubber gloves, and rubber boots.&lt;ref name=marklund/&gt; Originally, the coverall was in a bright orange color, and the racal suit was known as the '''orange suit'''.&lt;ref name=hotzone/&gt;

===Hood===
The hood is a separate component from the protective suit. The racal hood is a type of PAPR consisting of a transparent hood connected to a respirator, which is powered by a rechargeable battery. The respirator has three HEPA filters that are certified to remove 99.7% of particles of 0.03 to 3.0 microns in diameter. The filtered air is supplied at the rate of 170 [[standard litre per minute|L/min]] to the top of hood under [[positive pressure]] for breathing and cooling. The air is forced out through an air exhaust valve at the base of the hood. A two-way radio system is installed inside the hood for communication.&lt;ref name=hearing/&gt;&lt;ref name=cdc&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christopher|first1=George|title=Air Evacuation under High-Level Biosafety Containment: The Aeromedical Isolation Team|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|date=April 1999|volume=5|issue=2|pages=241–246|doi=10.3201/eid0502.990208|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/5/2/99-0208_article|accessdate=17 April 2015|pmid=10221876|pmc=2640682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the hood was manufactured by Racal Health &amp; Safety, Inc. located in [[Frederick, Maryland]], the same city in which the AIT unit of the [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] was based.&lt;ref name=sidell/&gt; The division of Racal responsible for the suit's manufacture later became part of [[3M]], and the respirator product line was branded as 3M/Racal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Racal Health &amp; Safety to be sold to 3M for GBP432 mil|url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/racal-health-and-safety-to-be-sold-to-3m-for-gbp432-mil--124544|accessdate=17 April 2015|work=Telecompaper|issue=5 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NIOSH Respirator User Notice|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/usernotices/notices/run-061298a.html|accessdate=17 April 2015|work=The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL)|date=12 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AIT later switched from using transparent bubble hoods to [[butyl rubber]] hoods.&lt;ref name=marklund&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marklund|first1=LA|title=Transporting patients with lethal contagious infections.|journal=International journal of trauma nursing|date=2002|volume=8|issue=2|pages=51–3|pmid=12000908|url=http://intljourtranur.com.marlin-prod.literatumonline.com/article/S1075-4210(02)70009-6/pdf|doi=10.1067/mtn.2002.121669a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedures==
The main purpose of the AIT was to evacuate a patient from the field to a specialized isolation unit. As part of their procedures, AIT members wore racal suits while transporting the patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hatfill|first1=Steven J.|last2=Nordin|first2=Trevor|last3=Shapiro|first3=Geoffrey L.|title=Ebola Virus Disease|journal=Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons|date=Winter 2014|volume=19|issue=4|pages=111|url=http://www.jpands.org/vol19no4/hatfill.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were trained to take a bathroom break before suiting up, since the time they would be in the suits could be 1 hour and 45 minutes for a training session and 4 to 6 hours for an actual mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming-Michael|first1=Karen|title=Training Day|url=http://ww2.dcmilitary.com/dcmilitary_archives/stories/092805/37324-1.shtml|accessdate=17 April 2015|work=Comprint Military Publications|date=28 September 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120160922/http://ww2.dcmilitary.com/dcmilitary_archives/stories/092805/37324-1.shtml|archivedate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patient was placed in a mobile stretcher isolator during transit. After the patient was delivered to the isolation unit, the members would leave the unit and enter into an [[anteroom]] with an [[airlock]]. They were then sprayed with [[glutaraldehyde]] solution to disinfect before the suit was cut away and sent to an on-site [[incinerator]] for complete destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hamblin|first1=James|title=21 Days|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/21-days/381901/|accessdate=17 April 2015|work=The Atlantic|date=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar suits==
The racal suit is similar to other [[positive pressure personnel suit]]s such as Chemturion, in that there is an air supply to provide positive pressure to reduce the chance of [[Airborne disease|airborne agents]] entering the suit. However, several components are different. The positive pressure section for the racal suit is only available at the hood. The air supply for racal suits comes from a battery-operated blower that makes the suit portable, whereas other suits must be connected to an air [[hose]] that is part of the building, such as in [[biosafety level 4]] laboratories. The main body part of the racal suit is also more lightweight and can be disposed of by burning after use.&lt;ref name=hotzone&gt;{{cite book|last1=Preston|first1=Richard|title=The Hot Zone|date=1994|publisher=Anchor (Random House)|isbn=0385479565|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0zNBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT130#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Racal suits were used in films such as ''[[Outbreak (film)|Outbreak]]'' in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Day|first1=Kathleen|title=A Clothes Call With Danger|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1995/03/11/a-clothes-call-with-danger/b1633930-89ac-4258-b7fa-5674a7dc4f8f/|accessdate=30 October 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=11 March 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used in many literatures related to situations with infectious diseases, such as in ''[[The Hot Zone|The Hot Zone: A Terrifying True Story]]'',&lt;ref name=hotzone/&gt; ''[[Infected (novel)|Infected]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sigler|first1=Scott|title=Infected a novel|date=2008|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9780307409171|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ihfWe10gLasC&amp;q=Racal&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Executive Orders]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clancy|first1=Tom|title=Executive orders|date=1996|publisher=Berkley Books|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=9780425158630|edition=Berkley mass market|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o4_E84Ch1MoC&amp;q=Racal#v=snippet&amp;q=Racal&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9584">[[File:Solar energy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Visible light]] such as [[sunlight]] carries radiant energy, which is used in [[solar power]] generation.]]
In [[physics]], and in particular as measured by [[radiometry]], '''radiant energy''' is the [[energy]] of [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] and [[gravitational radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;"''[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-029/_4341.htm Radiant energy]''". [[Federal standard 1037C]]&lt;/ref&gt; As energy, its SI unit is the [[joule]] (J). The quantity of radiant energy may be calculated by [[Integral|integrating]] [[radiant flux]] (or [[radiant flux|power]]) with respect to [[time]]. The symbol ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is often used throughout literature to denote radiant energy ("e" for "energetic", to avoid confusion with photometric quantities). In branches of physics other than radiometry, electromagnetic energy is referred to using ''E'' or ''W''. The term is used particularly when electromagnetic radiation is emitted by a source into the surrounding environment. This radiation may be visible or invisible to the human eye.&lt;ref&gt;George Frederick Barker, ''Physics: Advanced Course'', page 367&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardis, Jonathan E., "[http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/sp958-lide/025-027.pdf Visibility of Radiant Energy]". [[Portable Document Format|PDF]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology use and history==
The term "radiant energy" is most commonly used in the fields of [[radiometry]], [[solar energy]], [[heating]] and [[lighting]], but is also sometimes used in other fields (such as [[telecommunications]]). In modern applications involving transmission of power from one location to another, "radiant energy" is sometimes used to refer to the electromagnetic waves ''themselves'', rather than their ''energy'' (a property of the waves). In the past, the term "electro-radiant energy" has also been used.&lt;ref&gt;Examples: {{patent|US|1005338|"Transmitting apparatus"}}, {{patent|US|1018555|"Signaling by electroradiant energy"}}, and {{patent|US|1597901|"Radio apparatus"}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "radiant energy" also applies to [[gravitational radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennefick|first1=Daniel|title=Traveling at the Speed of Thought: Einstein and the Quest for Gravitational Waves|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-11727-0|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=UgggNsJhCp8C&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=Gravitational+wave+radiant+energy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pvL_LiTw5y&amp;sig=By_HN_Vh4fL6eI0oboKA19ctKNI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi80YfB_bLLAhUG9WMKHaahBaQ4FBDoAQgvMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=gravitational%20waves%20radiant%20energy&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sciama|first1=Dennis|title=Cutting the Galaxy's losses|journal=New Scientist|date=17 February 1972|page=373|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=_BnfnEMifSoC&amp;pg=PA373&amp;lpg=PA373&amp;dq=gravitational+waves+radiant+energy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O1eV9nnKiD&amp;sig=Ah71OYHbrG8XFk-kNNQHZl9awMc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-ztqv_rLLAhUW8GMKHTdpCwk4ChDoAQgaMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=radiant%20energy&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[First observation of gravitational waves|first gravitational waves ever observed]] were produced by a black hole collision that emitted about 5.3{{e|47}} joules of gravitational-wave energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbott|first1=B.P.|title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger|date=11 February 2016|url=http://physics.aps.org/featured-article-pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
[[File:TrigaReactorCore.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Cherenkov radiation]] glowing in the core of a [[TRIGA|TRIGA reactor]].]]
Because electromagnetic (EM) radiation can be conceptualized as a stream of [[photon]]s, radiant energy can be viewed as [[photon energy]] – the energy carried by these photons. Alternatively, EM radiation can be viewed as an electromagnetic wave, which carries energy in its oscillating electric and magnetic fields. These two views are completely equivalent and are reconciled to one another in [[quantum field theory]] (see [[wave-particle duality]]).

EM radiation can have various [[frequency|frequencies]]. The bands of frequency present in a given EM signal may be sharply defined, as is seen in [[Emission spectrum|atomic spectra]], or may be broad, as in [[blackbody radiation]]. In the photon picture, the energy carried by each photon is proportional to its frequency. In the wave picture, the energy of a monochromatic wave is proportional to its [[intensity (physics)|intensity]]. This implies that if two EM waves have the same intensity, but different frequencies, the one with the higher frequency "contains" fewer photons, since each photon is more energetic.

When EM waves are [[Absorption (optics)|absorbed]] by an object, the energy of the waves is converted to [[heat]] (or converted to electricity in case of a [[photoelectric effect|photoelectric]] material). This is a very familiar effect, since sunlight warms surfaces that it irradiates. Often this phenomenon is associated particularly with [[infrared]] radiation, but any kind of electromagnetic radiation will warm an object that absorbs it. EM waves can also be [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] or [[scattering|scattered]], in which case their energy is redirected or redistributed as well.

===Open systems===
Radiant energy is one of the mechanisms by which energy can enter or leave an [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]].&lt;ref&gt;Moran, M.J. and Shapiro, H.N., ''Fundamentals of Engineering
Thermodynamics'', Chapter 4. "Mass Conservation for an Open System", 5th Edition, John Wiley and Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-27471-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Christopherson, ''Elemental Geosystems'', Fourth Edition. Prentice Hall, 2003. Pages 608. {{ISBN|0-13-101553-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Grier Miller and Jessie L. Miller, ''[http://www.newciv.org/ISSS_Primer/asem22jm.html The Earth as a System]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a system can be man-made, such as a [[solar energy]] collector, or natural, such as the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. In [[geophysics]], most atmospheric gases, including the [[greenhouse gas]]es, allow the Sun's short-wavelength radiant energy to pass through to the Earth's surface, heating the ground and oceans. The absorbed solar energy is partly re-emitted as longer wavelength radiation (chiefly infrared radiation), some of which is absorbed by the atmospheric greenhouse gases. Radiant energy is produced in the sun as a result of [[nuclear fusion]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://assets.cambridge.org/97805217/91656/excerpt/9780521791656_excerpt.pdf Energy transformation]''. assets.cambridge.org. (excerpt)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Radiant energy is used for [[radiant heating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|1317883|"Method of generating radiant energy and projecting same through free air for producing heat"}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be generated electrically by [[infrared lamp]]s, or can be absorbed from [[sunlight]] and used to heat water. The heat energy is emitted from a warm element (floor, wall, overhead panel) and warms people and other objects in rooms rather than directly heating the air. Because of this, the air temperature may be lower than in a conventionally heated building, even though the room appears just as comfortable.

Various other applications of radiant energy have been devised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/go/classification/uspc250/defs250.htm Class 250, Radiant Energy], USPTO. March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; These include treatment and inspection, separating and sorting, medium of control, and medium of communication. Many of these applications involve a source of radiant energy and a detector that responds to that radiation and provides a signal representing some characteristic of the radiation. Radiant energy detectors produce responses to incident radiant energy either as an increase or decrease in [[electric potential]] or [[electric current|current]] flow or some other perceivable change, such as exposure of [[photographic film]].

Paden, "From the Churches of Christ to the Boston Movement", thesis submitted to the University of Kansas 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; When a denomination rebaptizes members of another denomination, it is a sign of significant differences in theology. Churches that practice exclusive [[adult baptism]], including [[Baptists]], [[Churches of Christ]] and [[Christian Churches]], rebaptize those who were baptized as infants because they do not consider [[infant baptism]] to be valid.

Rebaptism is generally associated with:
* [[Anabaptism]], from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἀνα-'' (re-) and ''βαπτίζω'' (baptize)
* Denominations that require [[believer's baptism]]
* [[Rebaptism (Mormonism)|Mormonism]]
* [[Oneness Pentecostal]] churches

In the 4th century, controversy was provoked by the [[Donatist]] sect's practice of re-baptizing Christians who had renounced their faith under persecution. The mainstream church decided that the [[Lapsi (Christian)|lapsi]] could not be rebaptized, because the [[Sacramental character|sacrament of baptism]] was irrevocable, leaving an [[indelible mark]] on the soul of the baptized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm, ''Catechism of the Catholic Church: The Sacrament of Baptism'' (Vatican.va Archive)]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, rebaptism of [[Arians]] was deemed necessary because Arians did not believe in the identical [[Holy Trinity]] as defined by the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]] and their baptism was therefore not in the name of the Trinity as understood by the Council.

== In the Catholic Church ==
The [[Catholic Church]] does not admit the possibility of rebaptism:&lt;blockquote&gt;1272. Incorporated into Christ by Baptism, the person baptized is configured to Christ. Baptism seals the Christian with the indelible spiritual mark (''character'') of his belonging to Christ. No sin can erase this mark, even if sin prevents Baptism from bearing the fruits of salvation. Given once for all, Baptism cannot be repeated.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;CCC 1256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The baptisms of those to be received into the Catholic Church from other Christian communities are held to be [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church#Validity and liceity of administration of the sacraments|valid]] if administered using the [[Trinitarian formula]].  As the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' explains:&lt;blockquote&gt;1256. The ordinary ministers of Baptism are the bishop and priest and, in the Latin Church, also the deacon. In case of necessity, anyone, even a non-baptized person, with the required intention, can baptize, by using the Trinitarian baptismal formula. The intention required is to will to do what the Church does when she baptizes. The Church finds the reason for this possibility in the universal saving will of God and the necessity of Baptism for salvation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1284. In case of necessity, any person can baptize provided that he have the intention of doing that which the Church does and provided that he pours water on the candidate's head while saying: "I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."&lt;ref&gt;CCC 1284.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The ''[[1983 Code of Canon Law]]'' (1983 CIC) addresses cases in which the validity of a person's baptism is in doubt:&lt;blockquote&gt;Can.  869 §1. If there is a doubt whether a person has been baptized or whether baptism was conferred validly and the doubt remains after a serious investigation, baptism is to be conferred conditionally.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;§2. Those baptized in a non-Catholic ecclesial community must not be baptized conditionally unless, after an examination of the matter and the form of the words used in the conferral of baptism and a consideration of the intention of the baptized adult and the minister of the baptism, a serious reason exists to doubt the validity of the baptism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;§3. If in the cases mentioned in §§1 and 2 the conferral or validity of the baptism remains doubtful, baptism is not to be conferred until after the doctrine of the sacrament of baptism is explained to the person to be baptized, if an adult, and the reasons of the doubtful validity of the baptism are explained to the person or, in the case of an infant, to the parents.&lt;ref&gt;1983 CIC, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2X.HTM Can. 869].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In cases where a valid baptism is performed subsequent to an invalid attempt, it is held that only one baptism actually occurred, namely the valid one.  Thus baptism is never repeated.

== In the Orthodox Church ==
Some have claimed the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] members have rebaptized [[Catholics]], but no evidence (besides rumors) has come to light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/byz/2005/00000029/00000001/art00003 Tia Kolbaba, "On the closing of the churches and the rebaptism of Latins: Greek perfidy or Latin slander?" in ''Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies'', Volume 29, Number 1, 2005 , pp. 39-51(13)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025144935/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/byz/2005/00000029/00000001/art00003 |date=October 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The only source is a dead link. The old claim needs to be explained before being dismissed--&gt; Greek Orthodox practice changed in 1755, when [[Patriarch Cyril V of Constantinople]] issued the ''Definition of the Holy Church of Christ Defending the Holy Baptism Given from God, and Spitting upon the Baptisms of the Heretics Which Are Otherwise Administered'', however, the Greek Orthodox does not now insist on rebaptizing Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jbburnett.com/resources/erickson_reception-svtq97.pdf John H. Erickson, "The Reception of Non-Orthodox into the Orthodox Church: Contemporary Practice" in ''St Vladimir’s Theological Quarterly'' 41 (1997) pp. 1-17]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other Christian Movements ==
[[Latter Day Saints]] practice rebaptism, as they do not accept the doctrine of the Trinity, in whose name mainstream Christian baptisms are conducted. They also believe they are the only church with the priesthood authority to perform saving ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] do not recognize previous baptisms conducted by any other denomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Awake!|date=January 8, 1994|pages=26&amp;ndash;27|title=Should You Be Baptized Again?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Scattering}}
'''Scattering''' is a general physical process where some forms of [[radiation]], such as [[light scattering|light]], [[sound]], or moving particles, are forced to deviate from a straight [[trajectory]] by one or more paths due to localized non-uniformities in the medium through which they pass. In conventional use, this also includes deviation of reflected radiation from the angle predicted by the [[law of reflection]]. Reflections that undergo scattering are often called ''[[diffuse reflection]]s'' and unscattered reflections are called ''[[specular]]'' (mirror-like) reflections. 

Scattering may also refer to [[particle collision |particle-particle collisions]] between molecules, atoms, [[electron]]s, photons and other particles. Examples include: [[cosmic ray]] scattering in the Earth's upper atmosphere; particle collisions inside [[particle accelerator]]s; electron scattering by gas atoms in fluorescent lamps; and [[neutron scattering]] inside [[nuclear reactor]]s. 

The types of non-uniformities which can cause scattering, sometimes known as ''scatterers'' or ''scattering centers'', are too numerous to list, but a small sample includes [[particle]]s, [[Liquid bubble|bubble]]s, [[droplet]]s, [[density]] fluctuations in [[fluid]]s, [[crystallite]]s in [[polycrystal]]line solids, defects in [[monocrystal]]line solids, [[surface roughness]], [[cell (biology)|cell]]s in organisms, and textile [[fiber]]s in clothing. The effects of such features on the path of almost any type of propagating wave or moving particle can be described in the framework of [[scattering theory]].

Some areas where scattering and scattering theory are significant include radar sensing, [[medical ultrasound]], [[semiconductor wafer]] inspection, [[polymerization]] process monitoring, acoustic tiling, free-space communications and [[computer-generated imagery]]. Particle-particle scattering theory is important in areas such as [[particle physics]], [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics]], [[nuclear physics]] and [[astrophysics]].

==Single and multiple scattering==
[[File:Zodiacal Glow Lightens Paranal Sky.jpg|thumb|[[Zodiacal light]] is a faint, diffuse glow visible in the [[night sky]]. The phenomenon stems from the [[light scattering by particles|scattering]] of [[sunlight]] by [[interplanetary dust cloud|interplanetary dust]] spread throughout [[invariable plane|the plane]] of the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1348a/ |title=Zodiacal Glow Lightens Paranal Sky |work=ESO Picture of the Week |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory]] |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{unreferenced-section|date=January 2017}}

When radiation is only scattered by one localized scattering center, this is called ''single scattering''. It is very common that scattering centers are grouped together; in such cases, radiation may scatter many times, in what is known as ''multiple scattering''. The main difference between the effects of single and multiple scattering is that single scattering can usually be treated as a random phenomenon, whereas multiple scattering, somewhat counterintuitively, can be modeled as a more deterministic process because the combined results of a large number of scattering events tend to average out. Multiple scattering can thus often be modeled well with [[diffusion theory]].

Because the location of a single scattering center is not usually well known relative to the path of the radiation, the outcome, which tends to depend strongly on the exact incoming trajectory, appears random to an observer. This type of scattering would be exemplified by an electron being fired at an atomic nucleus. In this case, the atom's exact position relative to the path of the electron is unknown and would be unmeasurable, so the exact trajectory of the electron after the collision cannot be predicted. Single scattering is therefore often described by probability distributions.

With multiple scattering, the randomness of the interaction tends to be averaged out by the large number of scattering events, so that the final path of the radiation appears to be a deterministic distribution of intensity. This is exemplified by a [[light beam]] passing through thick [[fog]]. Multiple scattering is highly analogous to [[diffusion]], and the terms ''multiple scattering'' and ''diffusion'' are interchangeable in many contexts. Optical elements designed to produce multiple scattering are thus known as ''diffusers''. [[Coherent backscattering]], an enhancement of [[backscattering]] that occurs when coherent radiation is multiply scattered by a random medium, is usually attributed to [[weak localization]].

Not all single scattering is random, however.  A well-controlled laser beam can be exactly positioned to scatter off a microscopic particle with a deterministic outcome, for instance. Such situations are encountered in [[radar]] scattering as well, where the targets tend to be macroscopic objects such as people or aircraft.

Similarly, multiple scattering can sometimes have somewhat random outcomes, particularly with coherent radiation. The random fluctuations in the multiply scattered intensity of coherent radiation are called [[speckle pattern|speckle]]s. Speckle also occurs if multiple parts of a coherent wave scatter from different centers. In certain rare circumstances, multiple scattering may only involve a small number of interactions such that the randomness is not completely averaged out. These systems are considered to be some of the most difficult to model accurately.

The description of scattering and the distinction between single and multiple scattering are tightly related to [[wave–particle duality]].

== Scattering theory ==
{{Main|Scattering theory}}

''[[Scattering theory]]'' is a framework for studying and understanding the scattering of [[wave|waves]] and [[Elementary particle|particles]].  Prosaically, wave scattering corresponds to the collision and scattering of a wave with some material object, for instance [[sunlight]] scattered by [[rain drop]]s to form a [[rainbow]]. Scattering also includes the interaction of [[billiard balls]] on a table, the [[Rutherford scattering]] (or angle change) of [[alpha particle]]s by [[gold]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], the Bragg scattering (or diffraction) of electrons and X-rays by a cluster of atoms, and the [[inelastic scattering]] of a fission fragment as it traverses a thin foil. More precisely, scattering consists of the study of how solutions of [[partial differential equations]], propagating freely "in the distant past", come together and interact with one another or with a [[boundary condition]], and then propagate away "to the distant future".

== Electromagnetic scattering ==
{{unreferenced-section|date=January 2017}}
[[Image:Electron-scattering.png|thumb|220px|A [[Feynman diagram]] of scattering between two electrons by emission of a virtual [[photon]].]]
[[Electromagnetic radiation|Electromagnetic waves]] are one of the best known and most commonly encountered forms of radiation that undergo scattering. [[light scattering|Scattering of light]] and radio waves (especially in [[radar]]) is particularly important. Several different aspects of electromagnetic scattering are distinct enough to have conventional names. Major forms of elastic light scattering (involving negligible energy transfer) are [[Rayleigh scattering]] and [[Mie theory|Mie scattering]]. Inelastic scattering includes [[Brillouin scattering]], [[Raman scattering]], inelastic [[X-ray]] scattering and [[Compton scattering]].

Light scattering is one of the two major physical processes that contribute to the visible appearance of most objects, the other being absorption. Surfaces described as ''white'' owe their appearance to multiple scattering of light by internal or surface inhomogeneities in the object, for example by the boundaries of transparent microscopic crystals that make up a stone or by the microscopic fibers in a sheet of paper. More generally, the [[Gloss (material appearance)|gloss]] (or [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]] or [[Gloss (paint)|sheen]]) of the surface is determined by scattering. Highly scattering surfaces are described as being dull or having a matte finish, while the absence of surface scattering leads to a glossy appearance, as with polished metal or stone. 

Spectral absorption, the selective absorption of certain colors, determines the color of most objects with some modification by [[elastic scattering]]. The apparent blue color of [[veins]] in skin is a common example where both spectral absorption and scattering play important and complex roles in the coloration. Light scattering can also create color without absorption, often shades of blue, as with the sky ([[Rayleigh scattering]]), the human blue [[iris (anatomy)|iris]], and the feathers of some birds (Prum et al. 1998). However, resonant light scattering in [[nanoparticles]] can produce many different highly saturated and vibrant hues, especially when [[surface plasmon resonance]] is involved (Roqué et al. 2006).

Models of light scattering can be divided into three domains based on a dimensionless size parameter, ''α'' which is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \pi D_\text{p} / \lambda,&lt;/math&gt;
where π''D''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the circumference of a particle and ''λ'' is the wavelength of incident radiation. Based on the value of ''α'', these domains are:
:''α'' ≪ 1: [[Rayleigh scattering]] (small particle compared to wavelength of light);
:''α'' ≈ 1: [[Mie scattering]] (particle about the same size as wavelength of light, valid only for spheres);
:''α'' ≫ 1: geometric scattering (particle much larger than wavelength of light).

[[Rayleigh scattering]] is a process in which electromagnetic radiation (including light) is scattered by a small spherical volume of variant refractive index, such as a particle, bubble, droplet, or even a density fluctuation. This effect was first modeled successfully by [[Lord Rayleigh]], from whom it gets its name. In order for Rayleigh's model to apply, the sphere must be much smaller in diameter than the [[wavelength]] (''λ'') of the scattered wave; typically the upper limit is taken to be about 1/10 the wavelength. In this size regime, the exact shape of the scattering center is usually not very significant and can often be treated as a sphere of equivalent volume. The inherent scattering that radiation undergoes passing through a pure gas is due to microscopic density fluctuations as the gas molecules move around, which are normally small enough in scale for Rayleigh's model to apply. This scattering mechanism is the primary cause of the blue color of the Earth's sky on a clear day, as the shorter blue wavelengths of sunlight passing overhead are more strongly scattered than the longer red wavelengths according to Rayleigh's famous 1/''λ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; relation. Along with absorption, such scattering is a major cause of the attenuation of radiation by the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. The degree of scattering varies as a function of the ratio of the particle diameter to the wavelength of the radiation, along with many other factors including [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], angle, and [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]].

For larger diameters, the problem of electromagnetic scattering by spheres was first solved by [[Gustav Mie]], and scattering by spheres larger than the Rayleigh range is therefore usually known as [[Mie theory|Mie scattering]]. In the Mie regime, the shape of the scattering center becomes much more significant and the theory only applies well to spheres and, with some modification, [[spheroids]] and [[ellipsoids]]. Closed-form solutions for scattering by certain other simple shapes exist, but no general closed-form solution is known for arbitrary shapes.

Both Mie and Rayleigh scattering are considered elastic scattering processes, in which the energy (and thus wavelength and frequency) of the light is not substantially changed. However, electromagnetic radiation scattered by moving scattering centers does undergo a [[Doppler shift]], which can be detected and used to measure the velocity of the scattering center/s in forms of techniques such as [[lidar]] and [[radar]]. This shift involves a slight change in energy.

At values of the ratio of particle diameter to wavelength more than about 10, the laws of [[geometric optics]] are mostly sufficient to describe the interaction of light with the particle, and at this point the interaction is not usually described as scattering.

For modeling of scattering in cases where the Rayleigh and Mie models do not apply such as irregularly shaped particles, there are many numerical methods that can be used. The most common are [[finite element method|finite-element methods]] which solve [[Maxwell's equations]] to find the distribution of the scattered electromagnetic field. Sophisticated software packages exist which allow the user to specify the refractive index or indices of the scattering feature in space, creating a 2- or sometimes 3-dimensional model of the structure. For relatively large and complex structures, these models  usually require substantial execution times on a computer.

The '''Southern African Power Pool''' ('''SAPP''') is a cooperation of the national electricity companies in Southern Africa under the auspices of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC). The members of SAPP have created a common power grid between their countries and a common market for electricity in the SADC region. SAPP was founded in 1995.

==Development==

The Southern African Power Pool has many long-term goals it wishes to achieve. 
Main goals include increasing the accessibility of electricity to rural communities, better the relationships between the involved countries, create strategies that will support sustainable development priorities, and to co-ordinate the planning of electric power.&lt;ref name="energy.gov.za"&gt;http://www.energy.gov.za/files/esources/electricity/electricity_powerpool.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with industrial productivity, electricity generation can assist in the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC)’s mandate of poverty elimination across Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sadc.int/themes/infrastructure/en/electricity-generation/&lt;/ref&gt; Only 5% of rural areas in Southern Africa have access to electricity, which prevents their ability to control sanitation, clean water, and food. In 2010, SADC passed the Regional Energy Access Strategy and Action Plan, which aims to combine regional energy resources as a means of ensuring the entire SADC region has access to affordable, sustainable electricity. The plan’s goal is to within ten years reduce half the number of people in the region without access to energy, and then halving it every five years until the region has universal access.

The most recent developments to the Southern African Power Pool came between the years of 1995 and 2005, where multiple interconnections were added. In 1995, an interconnector that ran from South Africa to Zimbabwe was completed, a Mozambique-South Africa interconnector was fixed in 1997, a Mozambique-Zimbabwe interconnector was finished, and most recently two power lines connecting South Africa to Maputo were finished.&lt;ref name="sustainabledevelopment.un.org"&gt;http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/3214interconnection_powerpools.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently being planned for future development is a Zambia-Tanzania power line, a Mozambique-Malawi power line, the fixing of the old Zambia power line, and the construction of a third [[Inga dams|Inga]] hydropower station by means of the [[Western Power Corridor|Westcor]] Project.

The Botswansa Power Corporation, Electricidade de Mocambique, ESKOM, Lesotho Electricity Corporation, NAMPOWER, Societe Nationale d'Electricitite, Swaziland Electricity Board, Zesco Limited, and the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority are operating members of the Power Pool. The Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi, Empresa Nacional de Electricidade, and the Tanzania Electricity Supply Company Ltd are the non-operating members of the Power Pool. The [[Copperbelt Energy Corporation]] is the only Independent Transmission Company of the Power Pool.&lt;ref name="sari-energy.org"&gt;http://www.sari-energy.org/PageFiles/What_We_Do/activities/sapp_eev_feb_2010/Presentations/Feb_14/Overview_of_the_SAPP.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Power trading between regions started in 1950 after the signed agreement between the Democratic Republicans of Congo and Zambia. Other parts of the continent also started a power trading business until 1995. In 1995 SAPP was founded and it was the first and advanced power pool in Africa. Since then the SAPP influenced the energy market and started competitive energy markets such as a day-ahead market (DAM).&lt;ref&gt;[[Electricity market]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afdb.org/en/blogs/integrating-africa/post/power-trade-in-africa-and-the-role-of-power-pools-12101/&lt;/ref&gt; Every year, each member donates a certain amount of money to the group as pre-determined in the document that set up the Power Pool.&lt;ref name="sari-energy.org"/&gt;
Today, most of the money that funds the Pool comes from donors, such as the World Bank and the Development Bank of Southern Africa.&lt;ref name="sari-energy.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dbsa.org/EN/NEWS/Pages/SADC-approves-more-than-US$3m-towards-regional-interconnector-project.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==

Despite being the most advanced power plant ever developed in Africa, the SAPP has some challenges and shortcomings. Its takes money to keep the plant running and the SAPP does not have the funds to create new investments. The SAPP also suffered from lack of infrastructure across the continent along with lack of maintenance for the existing infrastructure. There is not enough production because of the additional power that began running out by 2007.&lt;ref name="energy.gov.za"/&gt; One major challenge that the Power Pool encounters is the establishment of the dependable power supply in a location that lacks the surplus of invention ability and low costs. Another significant challenge that the SAPP is confronted with is the skills development and preservation of qualified workers.&lt;ref name="sari-energy.org"/&gt; The Southern African Power Pool 
faces the problem that power pools can only be sustained in areas with developed grid interconnections, an already decent amount of generating capacity that could be difficult for some other countries to meet, a legal framework that the members can agree to, and most importantly trust between the members.&lt;ref name="sustainabledevelopment.un.org"/&gt; As of right now the legal documents and framework that hold the Southern African Power Plant is from the PEAC legal framework which includes the Intergovernmental MOU, and the Inter-Utility MOU.

==Future Plans==

Despite recent challenges, the SAPP have long committed goals that can help in its expansion and company’s growth. The following plans are investment projects, interconnected grid, electricity access, and competitive market. Investment projects that creates new revenue includes hydropower and clean coal power plant alternative over nuclear. They also plan to improve SAPP central grid to improve the link between North and South Africa regarding to the new alternative power plant, hydropower and clean coal. Interconnected grids can expand SAPP activities. Along with the current SAPP members, there are future plans to involve other areas such as Tanzania, Malawi and Angola. Electricity access would expand the use of electricity to more areas in order to make it accessible to new borders. Lastly, strengthen and regulating competitive markets plan that sets up new rules that help meets consumers and investors satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esmap.org/sites/esmap.org/files/BN004-10_REISP-CD_South%20African%20Power%20Pool-Transmission%20&amp;%20Trading.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other African Power pools==
There are five African Power Pools, SAPP  (Southern African Power Pool), EAPP ([[East African Power Pool]]), CAPP ([[Central African Power Pool]]), WAPP ([[West African Power Pool]]) &amp; [[COMELC]].  

The DRC is the only member that is part of three pools, SAPP, EAPP and CAPP
Burundi is part of EAPP and CAPP. Tanzania is a member of SAPP and EAPP.  Guinea is part of CAPP and WAPP

'''St Mary the Virgin, Mortlake''' is a [[parish church]] in [[Mortlake]], in the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]].  It is part of the [[Church of England]] and the [[Anglican Communion]]. The [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Historical_usage|rector]] is The Revd Canon Dr Ann Nickson.

The building, on Mortlake High Street, London SW14, dates from 1543 and is [[listed building|Grade II* listed]].&lt;ref name=HE_listing&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1357705|desc=Parish Church of St Mary|accessdate= 8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first chapel in Mortlake, founded in 1348,&lt;ref name=HE_listing/&gt; stood on the river side of the High Street, on a site later occupied by [[Mortlake#Economy|Mortlake Brewery]]. The only surviving relic is a 15th-century [[Baptismal font|font]] presented to this church by [[Thomas Bourchier (cardinal)|Archbishop Bourchier]] (c.1404–86).&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

The present churchyard and church were given to the parish by [[King Henry VIII]] in 1543, an event commemorated by a stone in the west front of the tower. Its inscription "VIVAT RH8 1543"&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; is dismissed by [[Bridget Cherry|Cherry]] and [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] as "bogus".&lt;ref name="Cherry and Pevsner"/&gt;

The 1543 building has undergone many alterations and enlargements during its long history and, of the original [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] church, only the tower remains.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book | title=Barnes and Mortlake Past with East Sheen | publisher=Historical Publications | author= Maisie Brown  | year=1997 | location=London | pages=87–88 | isbn=0-948667-46-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[bell tower|belfry]] and the [[cupola]] are a distinctive feature of the tower which appears as a [[landmark]] in many historic prints and pictures of the [[Thames]] bank. The current appearance of the church is mostly the work of local architect Sir [[Arthur Blomfield]], who built the [[chancel]] in 1885; his firm built the [[nave]] in 1905.&lt;ref name="Cherry and Pevsner"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[The Buildings of England]]&amp;nbsp;– London 2: South | publisher=[[Penguin Books]] | author=[[Bridget Cherry]] and [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] | year=1983 | location=London | page=513 | isbn=0-14-0710-47-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vestry]] house dates from 1670. It was restored in 1979/80.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

===Internal fittings===
The church's [[pulpit]] was installed in 1902 in memory of Albert Shadwell Shutt, who had been the church's vicar from 1866 to 1896.

===Memorials===
The earliest surviving tomb in the churchyard is that of the astrologer [[John Partridge (astrologer)|John Partridge]], who died in 1715. Memorials to other famous people include a British Prime Minister, [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth]] (1757–1844)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-empire.com/iconography/tombe_addington-tombs.php?dansletitre=Tomb%20of%20Henry%20Addington |title=Tomb of Henry Addington |publisher=Napoleon-empire.com |accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Empire"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.napoleon-empire.com/personalities/addington.php | title=Henry Addington (1757–1844) First Viscount Sidmouth | work= Personalities|publisher=Napoleon &amp; Empire |authors= Lionel A Bouchon and Didier Grau| accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three [[Lord Mayors of London]].&lt;ref name="Churchyard"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stmarymortlake.org.uk/churchyard-and-labyrinth/ | title=Churchyard and Labyrinth | publisher=St Mary the Virgin Mortlake | accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial to [[John Dee]] (1527–1609), who lived opposite the church and is buried in an unmarked spot beneath the [[chancel]],&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; was unveiled in June 2013.&lt;ref name="Dee"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://johndeemortlakesoc.org/ | title=Welcome | publisher=John Dee of Mortlake Society | date=2013 | accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==
Together with [[Christ Church, East Sheen]] and [[All Saints Church, East Sheen|All Saints' Church, East Sheen]], St Mary's forms the parish of Mortlake with East Sheen. The parish publishes a monthly magazine, ''Parish Link''.&lt;ref name="Parish Link"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mortlakeparish.org.uk/parish-link-august/ | title=Parish Link | publisher=Parish of Mortlake with East Sheen | accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church stands in the [[Central Churchmanship|Central]] and [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal]] [[Churchmanship|traditions]] of the Church of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Team Vicar for All Saints East Sheen|url=http://www.allsaintschurch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Parish-Profile-post-CG-7.9.16.pdf|website=All Saints Church, East Sheen|accessdate=11 July 2017|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Services are held on Tuesday, Saturday and Sunday mornings.&lt;ref name="Services"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stmarymortlake.org.uk/our-services/ | title=Our Services | publisher=St Mary the Virgin Mortlake | accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18455">{{About|the superposition principle in linear systems|other uses|Superposition (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Anas platyrhynchos with ducklings reflecting water.jpg|thumb|right|Superposition of almost [[plane wave]]s (diagonal lines) from a distant source and waves from the [[wake]] of the [[duck]]s. [[Linearity]] holds only approximately in water and only for waves with small amplitudes relative to their wavelengths.]]
[[File:Rolling animation.gif|right|thumb| [[Rolling]] motion as superposition of two motions. The rolling motion of the wheel can be described as a combination of two separate motions: [[translation (geometry)|translation]] without [[rotation]], and rotation without translation.]]

The '''superposition principle''',&lt;ref&gt;The Penguin Dictionary of Physics,  ed. Valerie Illingworth, 1991, Penguin Books, London&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''superposition property''', states that, for all [[linear system]]s, the net response caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the responses that would have been caused by each stimulus individually. So that if input ''A'' produces response ''X'' and input ''B'' produces response ''Y'' then input (''A'' + ''B'') produces response (''X'' + ''Y'').

The homogeneity and additivity properties together are called Superposition. A linear function is one that satisfies the properties of superposition. It is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;F(x_1+x_2)=F(x_1)+F(x_2) \,&lt;/math&gt;{{pad|3em}}'''Additivity'''

:&lt;math&gt;F(a x)=a F(x) \,&lt;/math&gt;{{pad|10em}}'''Homogeneity'''

:for scalar {{mvar|a}}.

This principle has many applications in [[physics]] and [[engineering]] because many physical systems can be modeled as linear systems. For example, a [[beam (structure)|beam]] can be modeled as a linear system where the input stimulus is the [[structural load|load]] on the beam and the output response is the deflection of the beam.  The importance of linear systems is that they are easier to analyze mathematically; there is a large body of mathematical techniques, [[frequency domain]] [[linear transform]] methods such as [[Fourier transform|Fourier]], [[Laplace transform]]s, and [[linear operator]] theory, that are applicable.  Because physical systems are generally only approximately linear, the superposition principle is only an approximation of the true physical behaviour.

The superposition principle applies to ''any'' linear system, including [[algebraic equation]]s, [[linear differential equations]], and [[system of equations|systems of equations]] of those forms. The stimuli and responses could be numbers, functions, vectors, [[vector field]]s, time-varying signals, or any other object that satisfies [[vector space|certain axioms]]. Note that when vectors or vector fields are involved, a superposition is interpreted as a [[vector sum]].

==Relation to Fourier analysis and similar methods==
By writing a very general stimulus (in a linear system) as the superposition of stimuli of a specific, simple form, often the response becomes easier to compute.

For example, in [[Fourier analysis]], the stimulus is written as the superposition of infinitely many [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]s. Due to the superposition principle, each of these sinusoids can be analyzed separately, and its individual response can be computed. (The response is itself a sinusoid, with the same frequency as the stimulus, but generally a different [[amplitude]] and [[phase (waves)|phase]].) According to the superposition principle, the response to the original stimulus is the sum (or integral) of all the individual sinusoidal responses.

As another common example, in [[Green's function|Green's function analysis]], the stimulus is written as the superposition of infinitely many [[impulse function]]s, and the response is then a superposition of [[impulse response]]s.

Fourier analysis is particularly common for [[wave]]s. For example, in electromagnetic theory, ordinary [[light]] is described as a superposition of [[plane wave]]s (waves of fixed [[frequency]], [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], and direction). As long as the superposition principle holds (which is often but not always; see [[nonlinear optics]]), the behavior of any light wave can be understood as a superposition of the behavior of these simpler [[plane wave]]s.

==Wave superposition==
{{further|Wave|Wave equation}}

[[File:Standing wave 2.gif|thumb|right|Two waves traveling in opposite directions across the same medium combine linearly. In this animation, both waves have the same wavelength and the sum of amplitudes results in a [[standing wave]].]]

Waves are usually described by variations in some parameter through space and time—for example, height in a water wave, [[pressure]] in a sound wave, or the [[electromagnetic field]] in a light wave. The value of this parameter is called the [[amplitude]] of the wave, and the wave itself is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] specifying the amplitude at each point.

In any system with waves, the waveform at a given time is a function of the [[wave equation|sources]] (i.e., external forces, if any, that create or affect the wave) and [[initial condition]]s of the system. In many cases (for example, in the classic [[wave equation]]), the equation describing the wave is linear. When this is true, the superposition principle can be applied.
That means that the net amplitude caused by two or more waves traversing the same space is the sum of the amplitudes that would have been produced by the individual waves separately. For example, two waves traveling towards each other will pass right through each other without any distortion on the other side. (See image at top.)

===Wave diffraction vs. wave interference{{anchor|Diffraction vs. interference}}{{anchor|Interference vs. diffraction}}===
With regard to wave superposition, [[Richard Feynman]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Lectures in Physics, Vol, 1, 1963, pg. 30-1, Addison Wesley Publishing Company Reading, Mass [https://books.google.com/books?id=S-JFAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=SA30-PA1&amp;dq=feynman%20interference%20and%20diffraction&amp;pg=SA30-PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=feynman%20interference%20and%20diffraction&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|No-one has ever been able to define the difference between [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] and diffraction satisfactorily.  It is just a question of usage, and there is no specific, important physical difference between them.  The best we can do is, roughly speaking, is to say that when there are only a few sources, say two, interfering, then the result is usually called interference, but if there is a large number of them, it seems that the word diffraction is more often used.}}

Other authors elaborate:&lt;ref&gt;N. K. VERMA, ''Physics for Engineers'', PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd., Oct 18, 2013, p. 361. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kY-7AQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA361&amp;dq=feynman%20interference%20and%20diffraction&amp;pg=PA361#v=onepage&amp;q=feynman%20interference%20and%20diffraction&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The difference is one of convenience and convention. If the waves to be superposed originate from a few coherent sources, say, two, the effect is called interference. On the other hand, if the waves to be superposed originate by subdividing a wavefront into infinitesimal coherent wavelets (sources), the effect is called diffraction. That is the difference between the two phenomena is [a matter] of degree only, and basically they are two limiting cases of superposition effects.}}

Yet another source concurs:&lt;ref&gt;Tim Freegard, ''Introduction to the Physics of Waves'', Cambridge University Press, Nov 8, 2012. [https://books.google.com/books?id=eMMgAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=feynman%20interference%20and%20diffraction&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q=feynman%20interference%20and%20diffraction&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Inasmuch as the interference fringes observed by Young were the diffraction pattern of the double slit, this chapter [Fraunhofer diffraction] is therefore a continuation of Chapter 8 [Interference]. On the other hand, few opticians would regard the Michelson interferometer as an example of diffraction. Some of the important categories of diffraction relate to the interference that accompanies division of the wavefront, so Feynman's observation to some extent reflects the difficulty that we may have in distinguishing division of amplitude and division of wavefront.}}

===Wave interference===
{{main|Interference (wave propagation)}}

The phenomenon of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] between waves is based on this idea. When two or more waves traverse the same space, the net amplitude at each point is the sum of the amplitudes of the individual waves. In some cases, such as in [[noise-cancelling headphone]]s, the summed variation has a smaller [[amplitude]] than the component variations; this is called ''destructive interference''. In other cases, such as in a [[line array]], the summed variation will have a bigger amplitude than any of the components individually; this is called ''constructive interference''.

===Departures from linearity===
In most realistic physical situations, the equation governing the wave is only approximately linear. In these situations, the superposition principle only approximately holds. As a rule, the accuracy of the approximation tends to improve as the amplitude of the wave gets smaller. For examples of phenomena that arise when the superposition principle does not exactly hold, see the articles [[nonlinear optics]] and [[nonlinear acoustics]].

===Quantum superposition===
{{main|Quantum superposition}}

In [[quantum mechanics]], a principal task is to compute how a certain type of wave [[wave propagation|propagates]] and behaves. The wave is described by a [[wave function]], and the equation governing its behavior is called the [[Schrödinger equation]]. A primary approach to computing the behavior of a wave function is to write it as a superposition (called "[[quantum superposition]]") of (possibly infinitely many) other wave functions of a certain type—[[stationary state]]s whose behavior is particularly simple. Since the Schrödinger equation is linear, the behavior of the original wave function can be computed through the superposition principle this way.&lt;ref name="QuaMech"&gt;Quantum Mechanics, [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers|Kramers, H.A.]] publisher Dover, 1957, p. 62 {{ISBN|978-0-486-66772-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|projective2016-01-30}}The projective nature of quantum-mechanical-state space makes an important difference:  it does not permit superposition of the kind that is the topic of the present article.  A quantum mechanical state is a ''ray'' in [[projective Hilbert space]], not a ''vector''.  The sum of two rays is undefined.  To obtain the relative phase, we must decompose or split the ray into components
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi_i\rangle = \sum_{j}{C_j}|\phi_j\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;C_j\in \textbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;|\phi_j\rangle&lt;/math&gt; belongs to an orthonormal basis set.  The equivalence class of &lt;math&gt;|\psi_i\rangle&lt;/math&gt; allows a well-defined meaning to be given to the relative phases of the &lt;math&gt;C_j&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solem|first=J.

There are some likenesses between the superposition presented in the main on this page, and quantum superposition. Nevertheless, on the topic of quantum superposition, [[Hans Kramers|Kramers]] writes: "The principle of [quantum] superposition ... has no analogy in classical physics." According to [[Dirac]]: "''the superposition that occurs in quantum mechanics is of an essentially different nature from any occurring in the classical theory'' [italics in original]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac|Dirac, P.A.M.]] (1958). ''The Principles of Quantum Mechanics'', 4th edition, Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boundary value problems==
{{further|Boundary value problem}}

A common type of boundary value problem is (to put it abstractly) finding a function ''y'' that satisfies some equation
:&lt;math&gt;F(y)=0&lt;/math&gt;
with some boundary specification
:&lt;math&gt;G(y)=z&lt;/math&gt;
For example, in [[Laplace's equation]] with [[Dirichlet problem|Dirichlet boundary conditions]], ''F'' would be the [[Laplacian]] operator in a region ''R'', ''G'' would be an operator that restricts ''y'' to the boundary of ''R'', and ''z'' would be the function that ''y'' is required to equal on the boundary of ''R''.

In the case that ''F'' and ''G'' are both linear operators, then the superposition principle says that a superposition of solutions to the first equation is another solution to the first equation:
:&lt;math&gt;F(y_1)=F(y_2)=\cdots=0\ \Rightarrow\ F(y_1+y_2+\cdots)=0&lt;/math&gt;
while the boundary values superpose:
:&lt;math&gt;G(y_1)+G(y_2) = G(y_1+y_2)&lt;/math&gt;
Using these facts, if a list can be compiled of solutions to the first equation, then these solutions can be carefully put into a superposition such that it will satisfy the second equation. This is one common method of approaching boundary value problems.

==Additive state decomposition==
{{main|Additive state decomposition}}
Consider a simple linear system :&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=Ax+B(u_{1}+u_{2}), x(0)=x_{0}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By superposition principle, the system can be decomposed into&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_{1}=Ax_{1}+Bu_{1}, x_{1}(0)=x_{0}.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_{2}=Ax_{2}+Bu_{2}, x_{2}(0)=0.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
with&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x=x_{1}+x_{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Superposition principle is only available for linear systems. However, the [[Additive state decomposition]] can be applied not only to linear systems but also nonlinear systems. Next, consider a nonlinear system&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=Ax+B(u_{1}+u_{2})+ \phi (c^Tx), x(0)=x_{0}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a nonlinear function. By the additive state decomposition, the system can be ‘additively’ decomposed into&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_{1}=Ax_{1}+Bu_{1}+ \phi (y_{d}), x_{1}(0)=x_{0}.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_{2}=Ax_{2}+Bu_{2}+ \phi (c^Tx_{1}+c^Tx_{2})- \phi (y_{d}), x_{2}(0)=0.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
with&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x=x_{1}+x_{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This decomposition can help to simplify controller design.

==Other example applications==
* In [[electrical engineering]], in a [[linear circuit]], the input (an applied time-varying voltage signal) is related to the output (a current or voltage anywhere in the circuit) by a linear transformation. Thus, a superposition (i.e., sum) of input signals will yield the superposition of the responses. The use of [[Fourier analysis]] on this basis is particularly common. For another, related technique in circuit analysis, see [[Superposition theorem]].
* In [[physics]], [[Maxwell's equations]] imply that the (possibly time-varying) distributions of [[electric charge|charges]] and [[electric current|currents]] are related to the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s by a linear transformation. Thus, the superposition principle can be used to simplify the computation of fields which arise from a given charge and current distribution. The principle also applies to other linear differential equations arising in physics, such as the [[heat equation]].
* In [[mechanical engineering]], superposition is used to solve for beam and structure deflections of combined loads when the effects are linear (i.e., each load does not affect the results of the other loads, and the effect of each load does not significantly alter the geometry of the structural system).&lt;ref&gt;Mechanical Engineering Design, By Joseph Edward Shigley, Charles R. Mischke, Richard Gordon Budynas, Published 2004 McGraw-Hill Professional, p. 192 {{ISBN|0-07-252036-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mode superposition method uses the natural frequencies and mode shapes to characterize the dynamic response of a linear structure.&lt;ref&gt;Finite Element Procedures, Bathe, K. J., Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1996, p. 785 {{ISBN|0-13-301458-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[hydrogeology]], the superposition principle is applied to the [[Drawdown (hydrology)|drawdown]] of two or more [[water well]]s pumping in an ideal [[aquifer]].
* In [[process control]], the superposition principle is used in [[model predictive control]].
* The superposition principle can be applied when small deviations from a known solution to a nonlinear system are analyzed by [[linearization]].
* In [[music]], theorist [[Joseph Schillinger]] used a form of the superposition principle as one basis of his ''Theory of [[Rhythm]]'' in his ''[[Schillinger System of Musical Composition]]''.

==History==

According to [[Léon Brillouin]], the principle of superposition was first stated by [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1753: "The general motion of a vibrating system is given by a superposition of its proper vibrations." The principle was rejected by [[Leonhard Euler]] and then by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Joseph Lagrange]]. Later it became accepted, largely through the work of [[Joseph Fourier]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Léon Brillouin|Brillouin, L.]] (1946).

'''''The Language Instinct''''' is a 1994 book by [[Steven Pinker]], written for a general audience. Pinker argues that [[human]]s are born with an innate capacity for [[language]]. He deals sympathetically with [[Noam Chomsky]]'s claim that all human language shows evidence of a [[universal grammar]], but dissents from Chomsky's skepticism that evolutionary theory can explain the human language instinct.

==Thesis==
Pinker criticizes a number of common ideas about language, for example that children must be taught to use it, that most people's [[grammar]] is poor, that the quality of language is steadily declining, that language has a heavy influence on a person's possible range of thoughts (the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]), and that nonhuman animals have been taught language (see [[Great Ape language]]). Pinker sees language as an ability unique to humans, produced by [[evolution]] to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He compares language to other species' specialized adaptations such as [[spider]]s' web-weaving or [[beaver]]s' dam-building behavior, calling all three "[[instinct]]s".

By calling language an instinct, Pinker means that it is not a human invention in the sense that [[metalworking]] and even [[writing]] are. While only some human cultures possess these [[technology|technologies]], all cultures possess language. As further evidence for the universality of language, Pinker&amp;mdash;mainly relying on the work of [[Derek Bickerton]]&amp;mdash;notes that children spontaneously invent a consistent grammatical speech (a [[creole language|creole]]) even if they grow up among a mixed-culture population speaking an informal trade [[pidgin]] with no consistent rules. Deaf babies "babble" with their hands as others normally do with voice, and spontaneously invent [[sign language]]s with true grammar rather than a crude "me Tarzan, you Jane" pointing system. Language (speech) also develops in the absence of formal instruction or active attempts by parents to correct children's grammar. These signs suggest that rather than being a human invention, language is an innate human ability. Pinker also distinguishes language from humans' general reasoning ability, emphasizing that it is not simply a mark of advanced intelligence but rather a specialized "mental module". He distinguishes the linguist's notion of grammar, such as the placement of adjectives, from formal rules such as those in the  [[American English]] [[writing]] [[style guide]].   He argues that because rules like "a preposition is not a proper word to end a sentence with" must be explicitly taught, they are irrelevant to actual communication and should be ignored.  

Pinker attempts to trace the outlines of the language instinct by citing his own studies of language acquisition in children, and the works of many other linguists and psychologists in multiple fields, as well as numerous examples from popular culture. He notes, for instance, that specific types of brain damage cause specific impairments of language such as [[Expressive aphasia|Broca's aphasia]] or [[Receptive aphasia|Wernicke's aphasia]], that specific types of grammatical construction are especially hard to understand, and that there seems to be a [[critical period]] in childhood for language development just as there is a critical period for vision development in cats. Much of the book refers to Chomsky's concept of a [[universal grammar]], a meta-grammar into which all human languages fit. Pinker explains that a universal grammar represents specific structures in the human brain that recognize the general rules of other humans' speech, such as whether the local language places adjectives before or after nouns, and begin a specialized and very rapid learning process not explainable as reasoning from [[first principles]] or pure logic. This learning machinery exists only during a specific critical period of childhood and is then disassembled for thrift, freeing resources in an energy-hungry brain.

==Reception==
Pinker's assumptions about the innateness of language have been challenged; English linguist [[Geoffrey Sampson]] claims that "either the logic is fallacious, or the factual data are incorrect (or, sometimes, both)".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Sampson: [http://www.grsampson.net/BLID.html The ‘Language Instinct’ Debate].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]], writing in ''[[Why Freud Was Wrong]]'' (1995), concludes that Pinker argues cogently that the human capacity for language is part of the genetic endowment associated with the evolution through natural selection of specialised neural networks within the brain, and that its attack on the '[[standard social science model]]' of human nature is effective. Webster accepts Pinker's argument that, for ideological motives, twentieth-century social scientists have minimized the extent to which human nature is influenced by genetics. However, Webster finds Pinker's speculation about other specialized neural networks that may have evolved within the human brain—such as "intuitive mechanics" and "intuitive biology"—to be questionable, and believes that there is a danger that they will be treated by others as science. Webster believes that such speculations strengthen supporters of extreme genetic determinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Webster, Richard |title=Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis |publisher=The Orwell Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |pages=609–610 |isbn=0-9515922-5-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Paradisus Londonensis''''' (full title '''''The Paradisus Londonensis : or Coloured Figures of Plants Cultivated in the Vicinity of the Metropolis''''') is a book dated 1805–1808. It consists of coloured illustrations of 117 plants drawn by [[William Hooker (botanical illustrator)|William Hooker]], with explanatory text by [[Richard Anthony Salisbury]].

==Publication==
''The Paradisus Londinensis'' was constructed as two volumes, each of two parts. The plates were in one part, the text in the other. The title page of the first volume and part bears the date 1805 and identifies the illustrator and publisher as Hooker. The title page of the second part identifies the author of the text as Salisbury.&lt;ref name=Note2/&gt; It has often been catalogued as 1805–1807,&lt;ref name=Note1/&gt; although some later plates are dated 1808.&lt;ref name=Note2/&gt; The [[International Plant Names Index]]  dates the parts as follows:&lt;ref name=IPNI_pub/&gt;

==Botanical significance==

===New botanical names===
''The Paradisus Londinensis'' (abbreviated to ''Parad. Lond.'' in botanical citations) is a significant source of [[botanical name]]s, with around 150 attributed to Salisbury on the basis of this publication. Some have been superseded, but others are still in use. The names include:&lt;ref name=IPNI_adv/&gt;
* Two families, [[Dilleniaceae]] and [[Droseraceae]]
* 36 genera, including ''[[Acis (plant)|Acis]]'', ''[[Calypso (orchid)|Calypso]]'', ''[[Eustoma]]'' and ''[[Phyllodoce (plant)|Phyllodoce]]''
* 108 species, including ''[[Byblis liniflora]]'', ''[[Curcuma aromatica]]'', ''[[Goodia lotifolia]]'' and ''[[Lilium concolor]]''

===Dispute with Smith===
''The Paradisus Londinensis'' preserves a record of a dispute between Salisbury and [[James Edward Smith]] which had (and still has) consequences for the acceptance of botanical names first published by Salisbury, in this work and others. Smith and Salisbury had become friends while studying at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Later in life, in 1802, they quarrelled. Smith was a strong supporter of Linnaeus's ''[[systema sexuale]]'' (sexual system) for classifying plants.&lt;ref name=Boul97/&gt; He had bought Linnaeus's entire collection of books, manuscripts and specimens, and founded the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]] in 1788.&lt;ref name=Boul98/&gt;  Salisbury on the other hand was a supporter of the natural system of classification,&lt;ref name=Boul97/&gt; in particular that of [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu]], published in ''[[Genera Plantarum (1789)|Genera Plantarum]]'' in 1789 – the system used in ''Paradisus Londinensis''.&lt;ref name=Note4/&gt;

In his 1807 work, ''An introduction to physiological and systematical botany'', Smith had used newly discovered plants from the west coast of [[British Columbia]], Canada (plants which he did not name) to support the view that the [[tepal]]s of [[lilioid monocots]] were actually [[sepal]]s, since their flowers had what Smith regarded as six internal petals.&lt;ref name=Smit07/&gt; In ''The Paradisus Londinensis'', in the notes to number 98, dated 1 March 1808, Salisbury named these plants as the genus ''Hookera'' with two species ''H.&amp;nbsp;coronaria'' and ''H.&amp;nbsp;pulchella''. (The latter is illustrated as number 117.) Salisbury pointed out that the supposed internal petals were actually stamens (three sterile ones and the bases of three normal ones). He also disputed Smith's association of the plant with ''[[Agapanthus]]'', placing it instead with ''[[Allium]]''. He says "I regret much to dissent so often from the celebrated lecturer [Smith]".{{sfn|ps=|Salisbury|Hooker|1805–1808|loc=no. 98}}

Shortly afterwards in 1808, Smith named a moss genus ''[[Hookeria]]'' and read to the Linnean Society a formal description of a new genus, based on the same species as Salisbury's ''Hookera coronaria'', naming the genus ''Brodiaea'' in honour of Scottish botanist [[James Brodie (botanist)|James Brodie]]. (The presentation was not published until 1810.)&lt;ref name=Smit10/&gt; [[George Simonds Boulger|George Boulger]], writing in the ''Dictionary of National Biography'', says that Smith's actions were deliberately intended to deprive Salisbury of credit for the genus ''Hookera''.&lt;ref name=Boul97/&gt; In the text for figure 117, dated 1 September 1808, Salisbury says that "Smith, to suit his own purpose, was utterly silent" on the prior naming of the genus by Salisbury, and that Smith's "multiplied acts of injustice to me whether open or concealed, I sincerely forgive."{{sfn|ps=|Salisbury|Hooker|1805–1808|loc=no. 117}}

If it was Smith's deliberate intention to suppress Salisbury's botanical names by giving a moss a confusingly similar name and by renaming ''Hookera'' to ''Brodiaea'', he was, initially at least, successful. [[James Britten]], writing much later in 1886, argued that the then established name ''Brodiaea'' should be replaced by ''Hookera'', which had priority.&lt;ref name=Brit86a/&gt; (He also showed how many of Salisbury's other names had been ignored.&lt;ref name=Brit86b/&gt;) However, Smith's ''Hookeria'' and ''Brodiaea'' had become so widely used that they were made [[conserved name]]s, and ''Hookera'' was not reinstated. Salisbury's epithet ''coronaria'' in his ''Hookera coronaria'' is still used in the combination ''[[Brodiaea coronaria]]''. {{As of|2013|September}}, ''Hookera pulchella'' is considered as a synonym, either in full or in part, for ''[[Dichelostemma congestum]]'' or ''[[Dichelostemma capitatum]]'',&lt;ref name=ITISHp/&gt; and the epithet ''pulchella'' is not used, although Britten had argued for its priority.&lt;ref name=Brit86a/&gt;

[[File:6A8.JPG|thumb|100px|6A8 [[pentagrid converter]] with grid 4 on the top cap]]

In [[vacuum tube]] technology, a '''top cap''' is a terminal at the top of the tube envelope that connects one of the electrodes, the other electrodes being connected via the [[tube socket]].

Top caps have most commonly been used for:

* Amplifier or similar tube [[control grid]] connection, to provide greater circuit stability by isolating the low-signal circuit from the rest of the tube connections.
* [[Anode]] connection, to isolate the [[HT (vacuum tube)|high-tension]] circuit, allowing higher voltages to be used.
* Physical convenience. Grid top caps on frequency converters could be connected directly to an adjacent coil; Anode top caps on output tubes could be connected by ''flying leads'' directly to an output transformer. Shorter leads generally mean greater stability.

A few amplifier tubes used two top caps, symmetrically placed, one for anode and the other for grid.

[[File:866 mercury rectifier 1.jpeg|thumb|100px|866 mercury rectifier with anode top cap]]

In audio amplifier tube application, the top cap was originally used for the grid connection, and a serviceman could apply a moist finger to the terminal to confirm that the stage and subsequent circuits were working by listening for the hum this produced in the loudspeaker. This practice led to some nasty accidents when anode top caps were first introduced to amplifier stages (they had been used on rectifiers for some time).

'''Vacuum engineering''' deals with technological processes and equipment that use [[vacuum]] to achieve better results than those run under atmospheric [[pressure]]. The most widespread applications of vacuum technology are:
* [[Pyrolytic chromium carbide coating]]
* [[Antireflecting]] glass
* [[Glass colouring]]
* [[Vacuum impregnation]]
* [[Vacuum coating]]
* [[Vacuum drying]]

[[Vacuum coaters]] are capable of applying various types of coatings on [[metal]], [[glass]], [[plastic]] or [[ceramic]] surfaces, providing high quality and uniform thickness and color. [[Vacuum dryers]] can be used for delicate materials and save significant quantities of energy due to lower drying temperatures.

==Design and mechanism==
Vacuum systems usually consist of gauges, vapor jet and pumps, vapor traps and valves along with other extensional piping’s.  A vessel that is operating under vacuum system may be any of these types such as processing tank, steam simulator, particle accelerator, or any other type of space that has an enclosed chamber to maintain the system in less than atmospheric gas pressure.  Since a [[vacuum]] is created in an enclosed chamber, the consideration of being able to withstand external [[atmospheric pressure]] are the usual precaution for this type of design.  Along with the effect of buckling or collapsing, the outer shell of vacuum chamber will be carefully evaluated and any sign of deterioration will be corrected by the increase of thickness of the shell itself.The main material used for vacuum design are usually mild steel, stainless steel, and aluminum.Other sections such as glass are used for gauge glass or view ports or sometimes electrical insulation. The interior of [[vacuum chamber]] should always be smooth and free of rush and defections.
High pressure solvent are usually used to remove any excess oil and contaminants that will affect vacuum in any way.Due to [[vacuum chamber]] is in an enclosed space, very specific detergents can be used to prevent any hazards or danger during cleaning. Any [[vacuum chamber]] should always have a certain number of access and viewing ports.  These are usually served as a flange connection to the attachment of pumps, piping or any other parts required for system operation.  The most importance is the fabrication of vacuum chambers sealing capability.The chamber itself must be airtight to maintain perfect vacuum, this is ensure through the process of leaking hunting generally using mass [[spectrometer]] leak detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vacuum Science and Engineering|last=Atta|first=C.M. Van|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1965|isbn=|location=New York|pages=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All openings and connections are also assembled with O rings and gaskets to prevent any further possible leakage of air in the system.

==Technology==

Vacuum engineering uses techniques and equipment that vary greatly depending on the level of vacuum used. Pressure slightly reduced from atmospheric pressure may be used to control airflow in ventilation systems, or in material handling systems. Lower-pressure vacuums may be used in vacuum evaporation in processing of food stuffs without excessive heating. Higher grades of vacuum are used for degassing, vacuum metallurgy, and in the production of light bulbs and cathode ray tubes. So-called "ultrahigh" vacuums are required for certain semiconductor processing; the "hardest" vacuums with the lowest pressure are produced for experiments in physics, where even a few stray atoms of air would interfere with the experiment in progress.

Apparatus used varies with decreasing pressure. Blowers give way to various kinds of reciprocating and rotary pumps. For some important applications, a [[steam ejector]] can quickly evacuate a large process vessel to a rough vacuum, sufficient for some processes or as a preliminary to more complete pumping processes. The invention of the [[Sprengel pump]] was a critical step in the development of the incandescent light bulb as it allowed creation of a vacuum that was higher than previously available, which extended the life of the bulbs. At higher vacuum levels (lower pressures), diffusion pumps, absorption, cyrogenic pumps are used. Pumps are more like "compressors" since they gather the rarefied gases in the vacuum vessel and push them into a much higher pressure, smaller volume, exhaust. A chain of two or more different kinds of vacuum pumps may be used in a vacuum system, with one "roughing" pump removing most of the mass of air from the system, and the additional stages handling relatively smaller amounts of air at lower and lower pressures. In some applications, a chemical element is used to combine with the air remaining in an enclosure after pumping. For example, in electronic [[vacuum tube]]s, a metallic "getter" was heated by induction to remove the air left after initial pump down and closure of the tubes. The "getter" would also slowly remove any gas evolved within the tube during its remaining life, maintaining sufficiently good vacuum.

==Applications==
Vacuum technology is a method used to evacuate air from a closed volume by creating a pressure differential from the closed volume to some vent, the ultimate vent being the open atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vacuum Technology|last=|first=|publisher=Hydraulics &amp; Pneumatics|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=83–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; When using an industrial vacuum system, a vacuum pump or generator creates this pressure differential. A variety of technical inventions were created based on the idea of vacuum discovered during the 17th century. These range from vacuum generation pumps to X-ray tubes, which were later introduced to the medical field for use as sources of [[X-ray | X-ray radiation]]. The vacuum environment has come to play an important role in scientific research as new discoveries are being made by looking back to the basic fundamentals of pressure. The idea of “perfect vacuum” cannot be realized, but very nearly approximated by the technological discoveries of the early 20th century. Vacuum engineering today uses a range of different material, from aluminum to zirconium and just about everything in between. There may be the popular belief that vacuum technology deals only with valves, flanges, and other vacuum components, but novel scientific discoveries are often made with the assistance of these traditional vacuum technologies, especially in the realm of high-tech. Vacuum engineering is used for [[List of semiconductor materials#Compound semiconductors|compound semiconductors]], power devices, memory logic, and [[photovoltaics]].

Another technical invention is the vacuum pump. Such invention is used to remove gas molecules from sealed volume thus leaving behind a partial vacuum. More than one vacuum pumps are used in a single application to create fluent flow. Fluent flow is used to allow a clear path made using vacuum to remove any air molecules in the way of the process. Vacuum will be used in this process to attempted to create a perfect vacuum. A type of vacuum such as partial vacuum can be caused by the usage of [[positive displacement pump|positive displacement]] type pumps. A positive displacement pump is able to transfer gas load from the entrance to the exit port, but due to its limitation of design it can only achieve a relatively low vacuum. In order to reach a higher vacuum, other techniques must be used. By using a series of pump such as following up a fast pump down with a positive displacement type pump will create a way better vacuum than using a single pump. These combination of pump used is usually determined by the need of vacuum in the system.

[[Materials for use in vacuum]] systems must be carefully evaluated. Many materials have a degree of porosity, unimportant at ordinary pressures, but which would continually admit minute amounts of air into a vacuum system if incorrectly used. Some items, such as rubber and plastic, [[outgassing|give off gases into a vacuum]] that can contaminate the system. At high and ultrahigh vacuum levels, even metals must be carefully selected - air molecules and moisture can cling to the surface of metals, and any trapped gas within the metal may percolate to the surface under vacuum. In some vacuum systems, a simple coating of low-volatile grease is sufficient to seal gaps in joints, but at ultrahigh vacuum, fittings must be carefully machined and polished to minimize trapped gas. It is usual practice to bake components of a high-vacuum system; at high temperatures, any gases or moisture adhering to the surface is driven off. However, this requirement affects which materials can be used.

[[Particle accelerator]]s are the largest ultrahigh vacuum systems and can be up to kilometres in length.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Jousten (ed),C. Benjamin Nakhosteen (transl.),  ''Handbook of Vacuum Technology'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2016 {{ISBN|3527688242}}, chapters 1, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word “Vacuum” is originated from the Latin word “vacua”, which is translated to the word “empty”.Physicist use vacuum to describe a partially empty space, where air or some other  gases are being removed from one container. The idea of vacuum relating to the empty space has been speculated as early as 5th century from Greek philosophers, [[Aristotle]] (384-322 B.C.) was the one who came up with the relation of vacuum being an empty space in nature would be impossible to ever create.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7018/85d89b6a00275ba0cb627f54b5db326011f4.pdf .]&lt;/ref&gt; This idea had stuck around for over centuries until the 17th century, when vacuum technology and physics was discovered. In the mid 17th century, [[Evangelista Torricelli]] studied the properties of a vacuum generated by a mercury column in a glass tube; this became the [[barometer]], an instrument to observe variations in atmospheric air pressure.  [[Otto von Guericke]] spectacularly demonstrated the effect of atmospheric pressure in 1654, when teams of horses could not separate two 20-inch diameter hemispheres, which had been placed together and evacuated. In 1698, [[Thomas Savery]] patented a steam pump that relied on condensation of steam to produce a low-grade vacuum, for pumping water out of mines. The apparatus was improved in the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine]] of 1712; while inefficient, it allowed coal mines to be exploited that otherwise would flood by ground water. During the years of 1564-1642, the famous scientist [[Galileo]] was one of the first physicist to conduct experiments to develop measured forces to develop vacuum using a piston in a cylinder.This was a big discovery for scientist and was shared among others. French scientist and philosopher [[Blaise Pascal]] used the idea that was discovered to look into further research of vacuum. Pascal discoveries were similar to Torricelli’s research as Pascal used similar methods to pull vacuum using mercury. It was until the year 1661, when the mayor of the city of [[Magdeburg]] used this discovery to invent or retrofit new ideas. The mayor Otto von Guericke created the first air pump, modified the idea of water pumps, and also modified manometers.Vacuum engineering today, provides the solution for all thin film needs in the mechanical industry. This method of engineering is typically used for R&amp;D needs or large scale material production.

[[Atmospheric railway|Vacuum was used to propel trains]] experimentally.

Pump technology hit a plateau until [[Heinrich Geissler|Geissler]]  and [[Sprengel pump|Sprengle]] in the mid 19th century, who finally gave access to the high-vacuum regime. This led to the study of electrical discharges in vacuum, discovery of cathode rays,discovery of X-rays and the discovery of the electron. The photoelectric effect was observed in high vacuum, which was a key discovery that lead to the formulation of quantum mechanics and much of modern physics.

The [http://verra.org/project/vcs-program/ '''Verified Carbon Standard''' (VCS)], formerly the Voluntary Carbon Standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Peters-Stanley |first1=Molly |title=Regulators Embrace Voluntary Carbon |url=https://www.forest-trends.org/ecosystem_marketplace/regulators-embrace-voluntary-carbon/ |accessdate=2018-09-17 |publisher=Ecosystem Marketplace |date=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a standard for certifying carbon emissions reductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Verified Carbon Standard |url=http://verra.org/project/vcs-program/ |website=Verra |accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; VCS is administered by Verra, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who We Are |url=http://verra.org/about-verra/who-we-are/ |website=Verra |accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[The Climate Group]], [http://www.ieta.org International Emissions Trading Association (IETA)] and The [[World Economic Forum]] - convened a team of global carbon market experts to draft the first VCS requirements. The [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]] (WBCSD) joined the effort soon after. These experts soon formed the VCS Steering Committee, which worked to draft the first and subsequent versions of the VCS Standard. Many of the members of the original steering committee went on to be on the original [http://verra.org/about-verra/board-of-directors/ Board of Directors], which now has evolved into a body of 12 members that offers input and guidance to the organization.

By 2008, with the VCS Standard becoming more widely adopted, the Board of Directors named [http://verra.org/staff/david-antonioli/ David Antonioli] the organization’s first Chief Executive Officer. Soon after in 2009, VCS incorporated in [[Washington D.C.]] as a non-profit NGO.

On February 15, 2018, the organization that maintains the Verified Carbon Standard changed its name from Verified Carbon Standard to Verra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zwick |first1=Steve |title=Verified Carbon Standard Changes Name To Verra |url=https://www.forest-trends.org/ecosystem_marketplace/verified-carbon-standard-changes-name-verra/ |date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Volcano Museum''' ({{lang-de|Vulkanmuseum}}) in the old district administrative office (''Landratsamt'') in [[Daun]], [[Germany]], was set up as an extension of the existing 'geopaths' at [[Hillesheim (Eifel)|Hillesheim]], [[Manderscheid, Bitburg-Prüm|Manderscheid]] and [[Gerolstein]] and is part of the [[Volcanic Eifel Nature Park|Volcanic Eifel Nature and Geopark]].

Numerous information boards, photographs and exhibits from the [[Volcanic Eifel]], as well as of currently active volcanoes in Europe and Asia, offer insights into the geological development of the Volcanic Eifel region.

In addition there are several other volcano museums that cover the Eifel, such as the [[Maar Museum]] in Manderscheid and the [[Volcano House, Strohn]].

== Exhibits == 
In the [[exhibition room]]s are interactive computer models about the [[geology]] and [[volcanism]] of the Eifel. On a large overview map at the entrance, the phenomena of continental movement ([[plate tectonics]]) is explained, and currently active volcanoes can be viewed by means of fluorescent lights. A computer simulation shows the distribution of the continents in the geological eras of the past and also in the future. Other exhibits explain the origin and evolution of the rocks. In the exhibition room "Eifel Volcanism" the visitor can even simulate a volcanic eruption using a model of a [[cinder cone]].

Other models show the entire region of the volcanic [[West Eifel]] and the formation of volcano types in Eifel region. The models are supplemented in turn by numerous exhibits from the Volcanic Eifel. In the Volcanic Eifel Geo Centre all the geologically-related facilities of the Volcanic Eifel are summarized on an information board. These include the Devonian Route, the Bunter Sandstone Route, the Volcano Route, the Mineral Spring Route as well as mining and other museum facilities. Once again, visitors can illuminate geologically interesting places on a clear wall map using  buttons. In the basement of the museum, the training centre of the Geo Centre offers a wide range of media and exhibits relating to geology.

[[Image:Západní Sibiř.png|thumb|right|Western Siberian plain on a satellite map of [[North Asia]]]]
The '''West Siberian Plain''', also known as '''Zapadno-sibirskaya Ravnina''', ({{lang-ru|За́падно-Сиби́рская равни́на}}) is a large [[plain]] that occupies the western portion of [[Siberia]], between the [[Ural Mountains]] in the west and the [[Yenisei River]] in the east, and by the [[Altay Mountains]] on the southeast. Much of the plain is poorly drained and consists of some of the world's largest swamps and floodplains. Important cities include [[Omsk]], [[Novosibirsk]], [[Tomsk]] and [[Chelyabinsk]].

==Geography==
[[File:Siberian plain.jpg|thumb|right|Western Siberian plain seen from the [[Trans-Siberian railway]] outside [[Tatarsky District|Tatarskaya]]]]
The West Siberian Plain is located east of the [[Ural Mountains]] mostly in the territory of [[Russia]]. It has been described as the world's largest unbroken [[lowland]]&amp;mdash;more than 50 percent is less than 100 metres (330 ft) above sea level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-38578/Russia
|title=Russia
|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica
|accessdate=2006-10-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;and covers an area of about 2.6–{{convert|2.7|e6km2|abbr=off}} which is about one third of Siberia,&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/we/WestSibe.html
|title=Western Siberian Plain
|publisher=Columbia Encyclopedia
|accessdate=2006-10-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt; extending from north to south for 2,400&amp;nbsp;km (1,490&amp;nbsp;mi), from the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the foothills of the [[Altay Mountains]], and from east to west for 1,900&amp;nbsp;km (1,180&amp;nbsp;mi) from the [[Ural Mountains]] to the [[Yenisei River]].

The plain has eight distinct vegetation regions: [[tundra]], forest-tundra, northern [[taiga]], middle taiga, southern taiga, sub-taiga forest, forest-steppe, and [[steppe]]. The number of animal species in the West Siberian Plain ranges from at least 107 in the tundra to 278 or more in the forest-steppe region. The long Yenisei river flows broadly south to north, a distance of 3,530&amp;nbsp;km (2,195&amp;nbsp;mi) to the Arctic Ocean, where it discharges more than 20 million litres (5 million gallons) of water per second at its mouth. Together with its tributary Angara, the two rivers flow 5,530&amp;nbsp;km (3,435&amp;nbsp;mi). The valley formed by the Yenisei  acts as a rough dividing line between the West Siberian Plain and the Central Siberian Plateau. Glacial deposits extend as far south as the Ob-Irtysh confluence, forming occasional low hills and ridges, but otherwise the plain is exceedingly flat and featureless.

Winters on the West Siberian Plain are harsh and long. The climate of most of the plains is either subarctic or continental. Two of the larger cities on the plain{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} are [[Surgut]] and [[Nizhnevartovsk]].

==Geology==
The West Siberian Plain consists mostly of [[Cenozoic]] [[alluvial deposits]] and is extraordinarily flat. A rise of fifty metres in [[sea level]] would cause all land between the [[Arctic Ocean]] and [[Novosibirsk]] to be inundated (see also [[Turgai Straits]], [[West Siberian Glacial Lake]]). It is a region of the Earth’s crust that has undergone prolonged subsidence and is composed of horizontal deposits from as much as 65,000,000 years ago. Many of the deposits on this plain result from [[Ice jam|ice dam]]s that reversed the flow of the [[Ob River|Ob]] and [[Yenisei]] rivers, redirecting them into the [[Caspian Sea]], and perhaps the [[Aral Sea]] as well. It is very [[swamp]]y and soils are mostly [[peat]]y [[Histosol]]s and, in the treeless northern part, [[Histel]]s.

This is one of the world's largest areas of peatlands, which are characterized by [[Bog#Raised bog|raised bog]]s. It is believed that [[Vasyugan Swamp]] is the world’s largest single raised bog, covering approximately {{convert|51,600|sqkm|sqmi|-2}}.

In the south of the plain, where [[permafrost]] is largely absent, rich [[grassland]]s that are an extension of the [[Kazakh Steppe]] formed the original vegetation, which has almost all been cleared as of the early 21st century.

Large regions of the plains are flooded in the spring, and [[marshland]]s make much of the area unsuitable for agriculture. The principal rivers in the West Siberian Plain are from west to east the [[Irtysh]], [[Ob River|Ob]], [[Nadym River|Nadym]], [[Pur River|Pur]], [[Taz River|Taz]] and [[Yenisei]]. There are many lakes and swamps. This area had large [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] reserves. Most of Russia’s oil and gas production was extracted from this area during the 1970s and 80s.&lt;ref name="columbia"/&gt;
