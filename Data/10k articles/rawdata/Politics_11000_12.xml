{{Property law}}

A '''72-hour clause''', typically inserted in [[Real estate contract|real estate sale contracts]], is also known as an [[escape clause]], '''release clause''', '''kick-out clause''', '''hedge clause''' or '''right of first refusal clause'''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.property24.com/articles/72-hour-clause-explained/7959&lt;/ref&gt;

The 72-hour clause is a [[seller]] contingency which allows the seller to accept a [[buyer]]'s contingent [[Offer and acceptance|offer to purchase]] his/her [[property]], while allowing the seller to continue to market the property.

If the seller now receives another (better) offer to purchase the same property, he/she can also accept this offer, as a back-up offer. The seller can then activate the escape clause by notifying the original buyer about the back-up offer.

The first buyer now has a specified period of time to fulfil all the buyer contingencies in the contract of sale, or cancel the contract and lose the property. If the buyer cannot fulfil the contingencies in time, the original contract will cancel and the back-up offer will move into first position.

The term 72-hour clause can be somewhat misleading, because the notice period within which the buyer must fulfill the buyer contingencies can be negotiated. The effective notice period may therefore be longer or shorter than 72 hours. Further ambiguities arise if the 72 hours were only considered counted on business working days, excluding weekends and [[legal holiday]]s

'''Amado Boudou''' ({{IPA-es|aˈmaðo βuˈðu}}; born 19 November 1962) is an Argentine businessman and politician who served as the [[Vice President of Argentina]] from 2011 to 2015. He was previously [[Minister of Economy of Argentina|Minister of the Economy]] from 2009 to 2011.

In August 2018, following a [[Boudougate|lengthy investigation]], he was convicted of corruption. He was then sentenced to five years and ten months in prison, and banned for life from holding public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Argentina's former Vice-President Amado Boudou jailed for corruption |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45104286 |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=BBC News |date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Amado Boudou was born in [[Buenos Aires]], in 1962. His father, also named Amado, was born to a [[French Argentine|French immigrant]] from [[Aveyron]] named ''Aimé'', and this became a nickname for both.&lt;ref name=nacion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1149568-quien-es-amado-boudou|title=¿Quién es Amado Boudou?|work=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in the ocean-front city of [[Mar del Plata]] and enrolled in the [[National University of Mar del Plata]], where he received a degree in economics, in 1986; described by acquaintances as a sociable type and fond of the bass guitar, he helped produce a number of rock concerts in Mar del Plata in his days as a student, including a festival attended by 15,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=nacion /&gt;&lt;ref name=cv&gt;[http://www.consejo.org.ar/Cv05/boudou_amado.htm Amado Boudou: curriculum vitae] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boudou attended graduate courses in economics and was awarded a master's degree in economics by a private institution, the [[Universidad del CEMA|Argentine Macroeconomic Studies Center]] (CEMA), which is well-known locally for its support of [[neo-liberal]] and [[free market]] policies.&lt;ref name=nacion /&gt; Boudou was then brought in as a salesman by Venturino Ehisur S.A. (a local sanitation services company). Following his role in securing a number of lucrative hospital contracts for the company, he was named general manager in 1992 of their government contracts office. The company closed, however, when one of its top municipal clients terminated the contract in 1995.&lt;ref name=perfil&gt;[http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2008/10/25/noticia_0015.html ''Perfil'' (25 October 2008)] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then co-founded Ecoplata S.A., another sanitation services firm, and acted as its project manager; Ecoplata was awarded sanitation contracts by the resort cities of [[Villa Gesell]] and [[Pinamar]].&lt;ref name=cv /&gt; He married Daniela Andriuolo in 1993, but they were divorced five years later; they had no children.&lt;ref name=historia /&gt;

Boudou entered public service in 1998, when he was named to the Comptroller's Office of the National Social Security Administration ([[ANSES]]) by Economy Minister [[Roque Fernández]] (a fellow CEMA alumnus),&lt;ref name=nacion /&gt; and in February 2001, he was named that office's general manager. The election of [[Justicialist Party]] candidate Juan Pablo de Jesús as Mayor of the sea-side [[La Costa Partido|La Costa District]] resulted in Boudou's appointment as Finance Secretary for the popular resort district, which the policy maker accepted.&lt;ref name=cv /&gt;

The Finance Secretary subscribed to the 2005 Federal Housing Plan promulgated by President [[Néstor Kirchner]], a decision which made La Costa eligible for 486 low-income housing units. The contract, awarded to local builder Cantera FC in May 2005 for nearly US$10&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name=perfil /&gt; was followed by Boudou's return to the ANSES, in January 2006.&lt;ref name=nacion /&gt; The Cantera FC contract resulted in an administrative debacle, however, when the builder abandoned the works in June 2007, having by then received over US$7&amp;nbsp;million in payments (for which the Mayor never initiated litigation).&lt;ref name=perfil /&gt;

== National policy maker ==
Returned to the ANSES by its Director, [[Sergio Massa]], Boudou was named its Financial Director (a post second only to the director's in importance), and oversaw the voluntary conversion of several million private pension accounts to the ANSES' aegis when this choice was made available in December 2006. He was appointed its Director in October 2008, after Massa's promotion to the powerful post of Presidential Cabinet Chief.&lt;ref name=perfil /&gt;

Boudou's appointment coincided with President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]]'s controversial decision to transfer loss-plagued private [[pension funds]]' assets of nearly US$30&amp;nbsp;billion to the ANSES, citing the cost of subsidizing 77% of the funds' beneficiaries and the effects of the [[Financial crisis of 2008|international crisis]] on the government's ability to obtain financing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2008/10/20/elpais/p-01785008.htm "Analizan cambios profundos en el sistema de jubilación privada"] ''Clarín'' (20 October 2008) {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the ruling [[Front for Victory]]'s defeat in the June 2009 [[Argentine legislative election, 2009|mid-term elections]], Economy Minister [[Carlos Rafael Fernández]] tendered his resignation to the President, effective 7 July, and was replaced by the ANSES Director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/07/07/um/m-01954438.htm "Tras la dura derrota electoral, Cristina cambia medio Gabinete"], ''Clarín'' (7 July 2009) {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallout from the international, [[2008 financial crisis]] later forced the left-wing Argentine government of President [[Cristina Kirchner]] to seek domestic financing for growing public spending, as well as for [[foreign debt]] service obligations. These policies and ongoing [[capital flight]] put further pressure on the [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]]'s ability to finance debt service obligations, and the president ordered a US$6.7&amp;nbsp;billion account opened at the Central Bank for the latter purpose in December 2009, implying the use of the Central Bank's [[foreign exchange reserve]]s, and drawing direct opposition from the institution's President, [[Martín Redrado]]; Redrado was ultimately forced to resign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2010/01/22/um/m-02125286.htm "Aníbal Fernández: 'Redrado no entra más al Banco Central'"], ''Clarín'' (22 January 2010) {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boudou presented a [[Debt restructuring|debt swap]] package on 3 May 2010, for the holders of over US$18&amp;nbsp;billion in bonds who did not participate in the 2005 [[Argentine debt restructuring]] prepared by former Economy Minister [[Roberto Lavagna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2010/5/3/un-487506.asp ''Los Andes'' (3 May 2010)] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/63mtJIrUB?url=http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2010/5/3/un-487506.asp |date=8 December 2011 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Holdout problem|holdouts]] include numerous [[vulture fund]]s which had eschewed the 2005 offer, and had instead resorted to the courts in a bid for higher returns on their defaulted bonds. These disputes had led to a number of liens against central bank accounts in New York and, indirectly, to reduced Argentine access to international credit markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2010/01/12/um/m-02118566.htm "Embargaron fondos del Central en EE.UU. y el Gobierno volvió a denunciar maniobras desestabilizadoras"], ''Clarín'' (12 January 2010) {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010 Boudou compared Candelaria de la Sota and Martín Kanenguiser, journalists from ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'' and ''[[La Nación]]'', with the people cleaning the gas chambers during the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1313281 Agresión de Boudou a periodistas] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanenguiser requested clarification, but Boudou instead defended his statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1314013 La agresión de Boudou a periodistas fue un agravio para toda la sociedad] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attack was condemned by the FOPEA (an organization of journalists), members of the legislature,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1314035 Críticas a Boudou por la agresión a dos periodistas] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[DAIA]].&lt;ref name="daia"&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1313539 Unánime rechazo al ministro] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DAIA accused him of trivializing the holocaust, and Congressman [[Eduardo Amadeo]] demanded his resignation;&lt;ref name="daia" /&gt; Boudou later stated that this was a badly chosen metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1314115 "Se trató de una metáfora inadecuada", dijo Boudou tras la agresión a periodistas] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Economy Minister announced his bid for the office of [[Mayor of Buenos Aires]] in December 2010 as a candidate in the [[Front for Victory]] primaries ahead of the 2011 race; hoping to solidify his base among the country's influential trade unions, he made the announcement at the headquarters of SMATA (the machinists' and auto workers' union).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elargentino.com/nota-119189-Boudou-lanza-su-candidatura-a-Jefe-de-Gobierno.html ''El Argentino'': Boudou lanza su precandidatura a Jefe de Gobierno] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723093419/http://www.elargentino.com/nota-119189-Boudou-lanza-su-candidatura-a-Jefe-de-Gobierno.html |date=23 July 2011 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, however, Senator [[Daniel Filmus]] was nominated in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1375035-elecciones-en-la-capital-reunion-en-olivos-para-definir-candidatos|title=Filmus-Tomada, la fórmula kirchnerista para la Capital|work=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trial and conviction ===
{{Main|Boudougate}}
The vice president faced accusations of [[influence peddling]] in 2012 regarding contracts awarded by the Economy Ministry to Ciccone Printing for the supply of 100 peso bills, license plates, and other government issues. The controversy arose following statements made by the ex-wife of Ciccone executive Alejandro Vanderbroele to the effect that Boudou was his [[Sleeping partner|silent partner]] in the firm. It was alleged that [[César Guido Forcieri]], who had previously worked under Boudou, had made the connection between the two men. Pursuant to prosecutor Carlos Rívolo's request and following news that the [[Puerto Madero]] condominium rented by Boudou was owned by a friend of Vanderbroele who had, moreover, borrowed funds from Boudou, Judge Daniel Rafecas ordered the residence searched for proof of business associations between Vanderbroele and the vice president;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/politica/Allanaron-Amado-Boudou-Puerto-Madero_0_676132617.html|title=Operativo judicial en un departamento de Boudou|work=Clarín}}&lt;/ref&gt; a receipt for one month of [[homeowner association]] dues owed by the condominium's owner, Fabián Carosso, and paid instead by Vanderbroele was located in the search on 4 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infonews.com/2012/04/04/politica-16779-otra-operacion-de-clarin-vandenbroele-no-pago-expensas-de-boudou.php|title=Otra operación de Clarín: Vandenbroele no pagó expensas de Boudou|work=Info News|date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an August 2013 judicial ruling ordering prosecutors to provide evidence of wrongdoing, and their subsequent failure to do so, on 11 September a Federal Court granted a motion by Boudou's attorneys that would allow them to file for a [[Nolle prosequi|dismissal of charges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perfil.com/politica/Guio-judicial-a-Boudou-podria-pedir-su-sobreseimiento-en-el-caso-Ciccone-20130911-0025.html|title=Guiño judicial a Boudou: podría pedir su sobreseimiento en el caso Ciccone|work=Perfil|date=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, indicted on [[Bribery#Forms of bribery|passive bribery]] and influence peddling charges by Judge Ariel Lijo on 27 June 2014; Boudou appealed the indictment on 10 July, alleging [[malicious prosecution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buenosairesherald.com/article/164256/vp-amado-boudou-files-appeal-against-corruption-indictment|title=VP Amado Boudou files appeal against corruption indictment|work=Buenos Aires Herald|date=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boudou is also being investigated for several other offenses and/or crimes, and is a defendant in a total of ten cases in the Federal Courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perfil.com/politica/Boudou-suma-diez-causas-en-la-Justicia-federal-20140629-0053.html Boudou suma diez causas en la Justicia federal], Perfil, 29 June 2014 (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November 2017, Boudou was arrested on charges of [[money laundering]] and [[racketeering]], during the ongoing trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Argentina VP Boudou arrested in corruption case|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-corruption/ex-argentina-vp-boudou-arrested-in-corruption-case-idUSKBN1D317J|accessdate=4 November 2017|work=[[Reuters]]|date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was ended in August 2018, and he was sentenced to five years and ten months.

An '''admissions''' or '''application essay''', sometimes also called a '''personal statement''' or a '''statement of purpose''', is an [[essay]] or other written statement written by an applicant, often a prospective student applying to some [[college]], [[university]], or [[graduate school]]. The application essay is a common part of the [[university and college admissions]] process.

Some applications may require one or more essays to be completed, while others make essays optional or supplementary. Essay topics range from very specific to open-ended.

The [[University of Chicago]] is known for its unusual essay prompts in its undergraduate admissions application, including "What would you do with a foot-and-a-half-tall jar of [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]]"?&lt;ref&gt;Tamar Lewin, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/education/01chicago.html Earful Over Cheeky University Essay]" (December 31, 2009). ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0502/chicagojournal/report.shtml College Report]." ''Chicago Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Common Application]], used for undergraduate admissions by many American colleges and universities, requires a general admissions essay, in addition to any supplemental admissions essays required by member institutions. The Common Application offers students six admissions essay prompts from which to choose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegeapps.about.com/od/essays/a/EssayPrompts.htm|title=Tips and Samples for the Common Application Essay Options|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the essays – and even the way you put things in order throughout the application – should be directed towards getting one "big idea", a personal thesis that will be remembered after the entire package is read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.universityconsultantsofamerica.com/single-post/2016/02/09/Myths-About-%E2%80%9CThe-Essay%E2%80%9D | title=Myths About "The Essay" | date=February 9, 2016 | accessdate=September 23, 2016 | author=Robert LeVine}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Uni in the USA]]'', the Common Application essay is intended as a chance to describe "things that are unique, interesting and informative about yourself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniintheusa.com/how-why/us-applications/604/how-do-i-apply|title=How do I apply? - The Good Schools Guide|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104155800/http://www.uniintheusa.com/how-why/us-applications/604/how-do-i-apply|archivedate=2012-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application process for [[All Souls College, Oxford]], has the reputation of being the hardest examination in the world.  It consists of several specialist papers and, until 2010, also required candidates to write an essay upon a [[All Souls College, Oxford#Subjects of the .22Essay.22|topic]] suggested by a single word&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/7740812/All-Souls-Oxford-should-continue-to-put-genius-to-the-test.html |title=All Souls, Oxford should continue to put genius to the test |author=Harry Mount |date=19 May 2010 |journal=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''Possessions'', which was the topic of successful [[Fellow]], [[A.

'''Ferdinand August Bebel''' (22 February 1840 – 13 August 1913) was a German socialist politician, writer, and orator. He is best remembered as one of the founders of the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany]] (SDAP) in 1869, which in 1875 merged with the [[General German Workers' Association]] into the [[History of the Social Democratic Party of Germany|Socialist Workers' Party of Germany]] (SAPD). During the repression under the terms of the [[Anti-Socialist Laws]], Bebel became the leading figure of the [[Social democracy|social democratic]] movement in Germany and from 1892 until his death served as chairman of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Ferdinand August Bebel, known to all by his middle name, was born on 22 February 1840, in [[Deutz, Cologne|Deutz]], Germany, now a part of [[Cologne]]. He was the son of a [[Prussia]]n [[noncommissioned officer]] in the Prussian infantry, initially from [[Ostrów Wielkopolski|Ostrowo]] in the [[Province of Posen]], and was born in military barracks.&lt;ref name=americana&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Bebel, Ferdinand August}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young man, Bebel apprenticed as a carpenter and joiner in [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref name="People"&gt;"August Bebel, German Socialist Leader, Dies in Switzerland," ''The Weekly People'' [New York], vol. 23, no. 21 (23 August 1913), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Like most German workmen at that time, he traveled extensively in search of work and he thereby obtained a first-hand knowledge of the difficulties facing the working people of the day.

At [[Salzburg]], where he lived for some time, he joined a [[Roman Catholic]] workmen's club. When in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] in 1859 he volunteered for service in the war against Italy, but was rejected; and in his own country he was rejected likewise as physically unfit for the army.&lt;ref name=americana/&gt;

In 1860 he settled in Leipzig as a master turner, making horn buttons.&lt;ref name=americana/&gt; He joined various labor organizations.&lt;ref name=colliers&gt;{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Bebel, Ferdinand August}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially an opponent of socialism, Bebel gradually was won over to socialist ideas through pamphlets of [[Ferdinand Lassalle]], which popularized the ideas of [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref name="Lenin297"&gt;Vladimir Lenin, "August Bebel," ''Severnaia Pravada,'' 6 August 1913. Reprinted in Vladimir Lenin, ''Collected Works: Volume 19.'' Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1963; p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865 he came under the influence of [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] and was thereafter committed fully to the socialist cause.&lt;ref name="People" /&gt;

===Political career===
[[File:August Bebel c1910.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|August Bebel c. 1910]]
{{Marxism}}
Following the death of Lassalle, Bebel was among the group of Socialists that refused to follow new party leader [[Johann Baptist von Schweitzer]] at the Eisenach Conference of 1867, an action which gave rise to the name "Eisenachers" for this Marxist faction.&lt;ref name="People" /&gt; Together with Liebknecht, he founded the  ''[[Sächsische Volkspartei]]'' ("Saxon People's Party"). Bebel was also President of the Union of German Workers' Associations from 1867 and a member of the [[First International]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Pozdnyakov, "August Bebel," ''Karl Marx, Frederick Engels Collected Works: Volume 44.'' New York: International Publishers, 1989; p. 684.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bebel was elected to the [[North German Confederation|North German]] [[Reichstag (North German Confederation)|Reichstag]] as a member from [[Saxony]] in that same year.&lt;ref name="People" /&gt;

In 1869 he helped found the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany]] (SDAP), which later merged with another organization in 1875 to form the [[SAPD|Socialist Workers' Party of Germany]] (SAPD), which in turn became the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) in 1890.

Bebel's great organizing talent and oratorical power quickly made him one of the leaders of the socialists and their chief spokesman in parliament. He remained a member of the North German Parliament, and later of its counterpart for the [[German Empire]], the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]], until his death, except for the interval of 1881–83.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; He represented successively the districts of [[Glauchau]]-[[Meerane]], [[Dresden]], [[Strassburg]], and [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name=nie/&gt; Later in his life, he acted as chairman of the SPD. Representing as he did Marxian principles, he was bitterly opposed by certain factions of his party.&lt;ref name=colliers/&gt;

In 1870 he spoke in parliament against the continuance of the [[Franco-Prussian War|war with France]].&lt;ref name=americana/&gt; Bebel and Liebknecht were the only members who did not vote the extraordinary subsidy required for the war with France.&lt;ref name="People" /&gt; Bebel was one of only two socialists elected to the Reichstag in [[German federal election, 1871|1871]], and he used his position to protest against the annexation of [[Alsace and Lorraine]] and to express his full sympathy with the [[Paris Commune]]. German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] afterwards said that this speech of Bebel's was a “ray of light” showing him that socialism was an enemy to be fought against and crushed.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; Falsely accused of being in league with the French and part of a conspiracy to free French [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] held in Germany and to lead them in an attack from the rear, Bebel and Liebknecht were arrested for [[high treason]], but no prosecution was possible for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name="People" /&gt;

Not wanting to release such important opponents of the war effort, old charges of preaching dangerous doctrines and plotting against the state were levied against Bebel and Liebknecht in 1872.&lt;ref name="People" /&gt;  The pair were convicted and sentenced to two years in ''{{ill|Festungshaft|de}}'' (imprisonment in a fortress), which was spent at the famous [[Königstein Fortress]]. For insulting the German emperor, Bebel was additionally sentenced to nine months' ordinary imprisonment.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; This incarceration served to increase Bebel's prestige among his party associates and the sympathetic public at large.&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Bebel, Ferdinand August|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874 Bebel took a partner and founded a small button factory, for which he acted as salesman, but in 1889 he gave up his business to devote himself wholly to politics.&lt;ref name=americana/&gt;  In 1868 he became connected with the staff of the ''Volksstaat'' ("The People's State") at Leipzig, and in 1891 with that of the ''[[Vorwärts]]'' ("Forward") at [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;

After his release from prison, he helped to organize, at the congress of [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], the united party of Social Democrats, which had been formed during his imprisonment. After the passing of the Socialist Law he continued to show great activity in the debates of the Reichstag, and was also elected a member of the Saxon parliament; when the [[state of siege]] was proclaimed in Leipzig he was expelled from the city, and in 1886 condemned to nine months' imprisonment for taking part in a secret society.&lt;ref name=eb1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bebel, Ferdinand August}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In party meetings of 1890 and 1891, Bebel's policies were severely attacked, first by the extremists, the “young” Socialists from Berlin, who wished to abandon parliamentary action; against these Bebel won a complete victory. On the other side he was involved in a quarrel with Volmar and his school, who desired to put aside from immediate consideration the complete attainment of the socialist ideal, and proposed that the party should aim at bringing about, not a complete overthrow of society, but a gradual amelioration. This conflict of tendencies continued, and Bebel came to be regarded as the chief exponent of the traditional views of the orthodox Marxist party. Though a strong opponent of militarism, he publicly stated that foreign nations attacking Germany must not expect the help or the neutrality of the Social Democrats.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; Already in 1911 amid the rising tensions between the European powers, Bebel publicly predicted an upcoming [[World War I|great war]] with millions of soldiers confronting each other&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Das Nahen des Weltkriegs |trans-title=The Dawning of the World War |first=Gerd |last=Krumeich |work=[[Damals]] |language=German |pages=7–22 |year=2013 |volume=Special volume}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a [[Great Depression|great collapse]], "mass bankruptcy, mass misery, mass unemployment and great famine."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Stephen (8 January 2014) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25635311 Berlin 1914: A city of ambition and self-doubt], ''BBC News'', Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, at the [[Hanover Congress (1899)|Hanover Congress]] of the SPD, Bebel delivered a speech condemning [[Eduard Bernstein]]'s [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]]. His resolution, ''Attacks on the Fundamental Views and Tactics of the Party'', garnered the support of the vast majority of the Congress, including Bernstein's supporters.&lt;ref name="witbd"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/witbd/i.htm |title=What Is To Be Done? — I. Dogmatism And "Freedom of Criticism" |author=Vladimir Lenin |date=1902 |website=Marxists Internet Archive |publisher= |access-date= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class, race, pacifism, and 'prurient' sex===
Bebel particularly distinguished himself by his denunciation of the maltreatment of soldiers by officers and still more frequently by non-commissioned officers. His efforts in this matter had received great encouragement when King [[Albert of Saxony]] issued an edict dealing with the maltreatment of soldiers in the Saxon contingent, thus cutting the ground from under the feet of the Imperial Government, which had persistently attempted to deny or to explain away the cases put forward by Bebel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Bebel, Ferdinand August}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking before the ''Reichstag'',  Bebel criticized the war to crush the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in [[China]] in 1900, saying:

{{quote|No, this is no crusade, no holy war; it is a very ordinary war of conquest...A campaign of revenge as barbaric as has never been seen in the last centuries, and not often at all in history...not even with the Huns, not even with the Vandals...That is no match for what the German and other troops of foreign powers, together with the Japanese troops, have done in China…&lt;ref&gt;Mombaurer, Annika "Wilhelm II, Waldersee, and the Boxer Rebellion" pages 91–118 from The Kaiser edited by Annika Mombaurer, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003 page 97.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bebel is also famed for his outrage at the news of German mistreatment of indigenous people in its South-West African colony, the [[Herero people|Herero]] nation in particular. In 1904 following a revolt by the Herero people who were being pushed off their land to make way for German settlers, the government launched the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide]] to crush the revolt by waging a "war of extermination" against the Herero. He and the [[German Social Democratic Party]] thus became the only party in the Reichstag to oppose increased colonial expenditures,&lt;ref name="Deas2009"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=MA thesis  |institution=Brandeis University |url=https://bir.brandeis.edu/bitstream/handle/10192/23234/adeas_mathesis_0509.pdf.txt |first= Andrew |last=Deas |date=April 2009 |title=Germany's Introspective Wars. Colonial and Domestic Conflict in the German Press. Discourse on Race. 1904–1907 |page=45 |accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a speech in March 1904 Bebel classified the policy in [[German West Africa]] as ‘not only barbaric, but bestial.’ This caused some sections of the contemporary German press to scathingly classify Bebel as 'Der hereroische Bebel' (''Coburger Zeitung'', 17 January 1904).&lt;ref name="Deas2009" /&gt; Bebel was not deterred; he later followed this up with strongly worded warnings against the rising tide of theories of [[racial hierarchy]] and [[racial purity]], causing the general election to the [[German Reichstag]] in 1907 to go over in history as the ‘[[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentot]] Election.’&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Helmut Walser; ‘''The Talk of Genocide’'', the Rhetoric of Miscegenation: Notes on Debates in the German Reichstag Concerning Southwest Africa, 1904–1914, in The Imperialist Imagination: German Colonialism and its Legacy, (Sara Friedrichsmeyer etc. eds. 1998), p 107–23, 116, 111–12 &amp; 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bebel's book, ''Women and Socialism'' was translated into English by [[Daniel DeLeon]] of the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]] as ''Woman under Socialism''.&lt;ref&gt;August Bebel: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bebel/1879/woman-socialism/index.htm ''Women and Socialism''], Translation by Meta L. Stern (Hebe), Socialist Literature Co., New York 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; It figured prominently in the Connolly-DeLeon controversy after [[James Connolly]], then a member of the [[Socialist Labor Party of America|SLP]], denounced it as a "quasi-prurient" book that would repel potential recruits to the socialist movement.&lt;ref&gt;James Connolly &amp; Daniel DeLeon: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/connolly/1904/condel/index.htm ''The Connolly-DeLeon controversy'']. Cork Workers' Club, Cork 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The book contained an attack on the institution of marriage which identified Bebel with the most extreme forms of socialism.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; In the preface to DeLeon's translation, 'Woman Under Socialism', DeLeon distanced himself from Bebel on this point, holding that monogamy was the most desirable form of social organisation.

===Death and legacy===
August Bebel died on 13 August 1913 of a heart attack during a visit to a sanatorium in [[Churwalden|Passugg]], Switzerland. He was 73 years old at the time of his death. His body was buried in [[Zürich]].

At the time of his death Bebel was eulogized by Russian Marxist leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] as a "model workers' leader," who had proven himself able to "break his own road" from being an ordinary worker into becoming a political leader in the struggle for a "better social system."&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Lenin, "August Bebel," ''Collected Works: Vol. 19, pp. 300–301.&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-known saying "Anti-Semitism is the socialism of fools" ("''Der Antisemitismus ist der Sozialismus der dummen Kerle''") is frequently attributed to Bebel, but probably originated with the Austrian democrat [[Ferdinand Kronawetter]]; it was in general use among German Social Democrats by the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Evans, ''The Coming of the Third Reich'' (Penguin Group, 2005: {{ISBN|0-14-303469-3}}), p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bebel, along with [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Ferdinand Lassalle]], was among the socialist icons included in bas relief portraits on the facade of [[The Forward]] building, erected in 1912 as the headquarters of the New York Yiddish-language socialist newspaper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4466">The '''''Bangsa Malaysia''''' ({{lang-en|'''Malaysian nation'''}}) policy was introduced by [[Mahathir Mohamad]], then [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], to create an inclusive national identity for all inhabitants of [[Malaysia]], thus abandoning the [[National Culture Policy]] that asserted a [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] ethnic national identity. Mahathir Mohamad said it means "people being able to identify themselves with the country, speak ''Bahasa Malaysia'' (the [[Malay language]]) and accept the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Constitution]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/95/1006/nat4.html One nation, one people]. (Jun. 10, 1995). ''[[Asiaweek]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy's support in the government appears to be variable, however. [[Abdul Ghani Othman]], the Menteri Besar of [[Johor]], alleged that ''Bangsa Malaysia'' was a "nebulous concept" which overstepped the bounds of the Constitution. "Even if the term ''Bangsa Malaysia'' is to be used, it must only be applied in the context of all the peoples of Malaysia with the Malays as the pivotal race," he said.&lt;ref&gt;Nambiar, Ravi &amp; Nadzmi, Siti Nurbaiyah (Nov. 6, 2006). "Ghani: Bangsa Malaysia is rojak and unacceptable", p. 10. ''New Straits Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Lim Keng Yaik]], a Minister in the federal government, insisted that ''Bangsa Malaysia'' was an official government policy.&lt;ref&gt;"'Johor Umno going against government'", p. 10. (Nov. 6, 2006). ''New Straits Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Ministers also criticised Ghani's statement; one said that the policy "has nothing to do with one race given a pivotal role over others", while another said that "It does not impinge on the rights of Bumiputeras or other communities."&lt;ref name="reaction to ghani"&gt;"'Rejection of concept affects integration efforts'", p. 7. (Nov. 7, 2006). ''New Straits Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deputy Prime Minister [[Najib Tun Razak]] argued that attempting to define the policy from a political viewpoint was pointless, as it had no official standing in the Constitution, and called for the debate to cease. He also said that "Bangsa Malaysia means we do not evaluate someone by his skin colour, race or religion," and contradicted Ghani, saying: "It does not question the special rights of the Malays, our quota or anything of that sort."&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Marsha, Teh, Eng Hock, Vijayan, Meera &amp; Zolkepli, Farik (Nov. 7, 2006). [http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/11/7/nation/15939803&amp;sec=nation&amp;focus=1 Bangsa Malaysia in mind]. ''The Star''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ghani insisted, however, that those advocating ''Bangsa Malaysia'' were echoing [[Lee Kuan Yew]]'s call for a "[[Malaysian Malaysia]]" made during the early 1960s when [[Singapore]] was a state in Malaysia, even though the campaign had been repudiated by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Nambiar, Ravi &amp; Nadzmi, Siti Nurbaiyah (Nov. 7, 2006). "No Bangsa Malaysia in Constitution, says Najib", p. 6. ''New Straits Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

One academic suggested that the conflict stemmed from the different meanings of the word "bangsa", which can mean either race or nation. Although the concept of a Malaysian race could be confusing, he suggested, taking ''Bangsa Malaysia'' to imply a Malaysian nation would be more sensible.&lt;ref name="reaction to ghani"/&gt;

After the UMNO Annual General Assembly that year, Ghani elaborated that his opposition to ''Bangsa Malaysia'' and "Malaysian Malaysia" was because:

{{quote|It is about everything being equal and this does not capture the hearts of Malaysians. Therefore, regardless of whatever name is given, the concept is similar and this is against ''idea kenegaraan'' (the idea of nationhood) which we have inherited.}}

Ghani defined his ''idea kenegaraan'' as "the idea that has united the Malays, and also the same idea that has given privileges to other races to be citizens, live together and share power and prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Marsha (Dec. 3, 2006). [http://thestaronline.com/news/story.asp?file=/2006/12/3/nation/16212464&amp;sec=nation Ghani on why people cannot accept concept] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521031546/http://thestaronline.com/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F12%2F3%2Fnation%2F16212464&amp;sec=nation |date=2008-05-21 }}.

'''George Ernest “Bartlett” Adamson''' (22 December 1884 – 4 November 1951) was an Australian journalist, poet, author and political activist.

==Life and work==

Adamson was born at Cascade, [[Ringarooma]], [[Tasmania]], on 22 December 1884 to a Scottish miner, George Adamson, and his English wife, Jane, nee Bartlett. He was educated at [[Zeehan, Tasmania|Zeehan]] and [[Dundas, Tasmania|Dundas]] and then worked as a clerk at a mine. The family moved to [[New Zealand]] where he worked as a clerk with publishers [[Whitcoulls|Whitcomb and Tombs]] in [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]]. He was rejected for military service during [[World War I]] on medical grounds.

He married Scottish-born Mary Anne McLachlan in November 1917 and they went on to have four sons. Always interested in literature, he published a volume of verse, ''Twelve Sonnets'' in 1918. This was well received and prompted his departure for [[Australia]]. In [[Sydney]] he took a position as a journalist with ''[[Smith's Weekly]]'', writing feature articles, verse and light fiction. He left the paper in 1923 and began work as a freelance writer, especially for the ''Sunday Times''. He worked on the side as an orchadist and helped to establish a co-operative for local orchardists.

He established the periodical ''Sydneysider'', but it crashed during the [[Great depression|Depression]]. This forced a return, in 1935, to ''[[Smith's Weekly]]'', where he remained till its closure, in 1950.

He was active on the executive of the [[Fellowship of Australian Writers]], and served a term as its president. In that capacity he was successful in persuading the [[Government of Australia|federal government]] to increase funding for the [[Commonwealth Literary Fund]] in 1938. He also lobbied for more liberal changes to the Obscene and Indecent Publications (Amendment) Act of 1946. His left wing sympathies and the rise of fascism in Europe during [[World War II]] saw him join the [[Communist Party of Australia|Australian Communist Party]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;William H. Wilde, Joy Hooton &amp; Barry Andrews, ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature'', OUP, Melbourne, 1986, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subjects of his books varied widely and ranged from children's books to collections of leftist political verse. He was a campaigner for civil liberties and often used his writing to try and improve the condition of ordinary people.

He died suddenly, on 4 November 1951, while addressing a crowd in [[the Domain, Sydney|the Domain]], Sydney.

==Publications==

'''Comitato Parlamentare di Controllo per i Servizi di Informazione e Sicurezza e per il Segreto di Stato''' (Parliamentary Committee for the Intelligence and Security Services and for State Secret Control), is a body of the Italian Parliament deputed to survey and oversee the activities of the [[Italian intelligence agencies]].

== History ==
Since the end of World War II, Italian intelligence agencies have been reorganized many times in an attempt to increase their effectiveness and bring them more fully under civilian control.

The committee was established as part of a broader reform of the Italian intelligence community, which represented the latest in a long string of government attempts to effectively manage Italy's intelligence agencies.

* In 1977, with Legislative Act n.801 of 24/10/1977, this came after a former chief of [[Servizio Informazioni Difesa|SID]], [[Vito Miceli]], was arrested for "conspiration against the State" (See [[Golpe Borghese]]), and the intelligence agencies were reorganized in a democratic attempt. This re-organization mainly consisted of:
** The split of [[Servizio Informazioni Difesa|SID]], the intelligence agency at that time, into two separate agencies with different roles: [[SISDE]] (the domestic one) and [[SISMI]] (the military one).
** The creation of [[CESIS]], with a coordination role between the two intelligence agencies and the [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|Presidency of the Council of Ministers]].
** The creation of the Parliamentary Committee, COPACO, to oversee the activities of the two agencies.
* Since 1 August 2007, with Legislative Act n.124 of 08/03/2007, following the reform of the Italian intelligence agencies, SISDE, SISMI and CESIS were replaced respectively by [[Agenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Interna|AISI]], [[Agenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Esterna|AISE]] and [[Dipartimento delle Informazioni per la Sicurezza|DIS]];&lt;ref&gt;Legislative Act n.124 of 08/03/2007, reported on the Official Gazette of the Italian Republic, General Series, n.187 of 08/13/2007. [http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/gurifulcrum/dispatcher?service=1&amp;datagu=2007-08-13&amp;task=sommario&amp;numgu=187&amp;tmstp=1189016330697]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.{{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the COPACO was renamed COPASIR ('''Comitato Parlamentare per la Sicurezza della Repubblica''', Parliamentary Committee for the Security of the Republic) and granted additional oversight and control powers.

== Mission ==
Following the reform of the Italian intelligence agencies approved on 1 August 2007, COPACO has the power to:

* Dismiss the State Secret, but only if all members of the Committee agree at the unanimity.
* Acquire acts and dossiers from judicial investigations, with the authority to overcome the professional secrecy, both of judicial and banking nature.
* Have free access to intelligence agencies' offices and documentations.

COPACO is constituted by four Senators and four Deputies, designated proportionally by the Presidents of the two Chambers (the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Italian Senate|Senate of the Republic]]).

The Committee is composed of:

* President: deputy [[Lorenzo Guerini]]
* Vice-president: senator [[Adolfo Urso]]
* Secretary: deputy [[Federica Dieni]]
* Components: deputies [[Riccardo Molinari]], [[Elio Vito]] and [[Antonio Zennaro]]; senators [[Paolo Arrigoni]], [[Francesco Castiello]], [[Claudio Fazzone]] and [[Ernesto Magorno]].

=== List of presidents ===
* Deputy [[Claudio Scajola]] (2007-2008, [[Forza Italia]])
* Senator [[Francesco Rutelli]] (2008-2010, [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]])
* Deputy [[Massimo D'Alema]] (2010-2013, [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]])
* Senator [[Giacomo Stucchi]] (2013-2018, [[Northern League (Italy)|Northern League]])
* Deputy [[Lorenzo Guerini]] (since 2018, [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]])

[[File:Ecological Cannabis Party.jpg|thumb|The purposal to renew Cannabis party [[Cannabis Party (Spain)|PCLYN]] as "Ecological Cannabis Party" in Spain 2006, from the people who were in the Cannabis Valencia Party in Spain's March 2004 general election]]

'''Cannabis political parties''' are generally [[Single-issue politics|single-issue]] parties that exist to oppose the laws against [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].

==Australia==
In 2013, the Drug Law Reform Party successfully registered with the Australian Electoral Commission, with over 500 members as required. Although the party represented the liberalisation of drug laws in general, [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] was a primary focus. The party officially deregistered on 31 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Deregistered_parties/files/2017-6252.pdf Drug Law Reform Australia Voluntary Deregistration]. Accessed via the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) (official website). Retrieved 7 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, J.J. McRoach ran for parliament as candidate for the [[Australia]]n [[Marijuana Party (Australia)|Marijuana Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=McRoach, J. J | author2=Australian Marijuana Party | title=A dozen dopey yarns : tales from the pot prohibition | publication-date=1979 | publisher=Australian Marijuana Party | isbn=978-0-908200-00-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an advertising campaign funded by an anonymous dealer. His party came fourth in the elections.
In 1986 Nick Brash ran for the "Marijuana Party" for the Kiama NSW by-election against ALP heavy-weight Bob "Bobo" Harrison. Then in 1987 Nick Brash ran in the Heathcote NSW by-election with 13 other candidates including the infamous Rex "Buckets" Jackson. This campaign was partly funded by the late John Marsden, solicitor and  outspoken civil libertarian. In the 1988 NSW State Election he joined Macciza Macpherson in running for the Legislative Council Soon after, the electoral laws were changed requiring all political parties to prove a membership of 500 enrolled voters, an impossible task for the Marijuana Party. 
The independent [[HEMP Legalise Marijuana]] party continues to run in the upper house in [[South Australian state elections]], with their best result being in 1997 when they received 1.7% of the vote, beating relatively popular parties such as the [[SA Greens]] and the SA branch of the [[National Party of Australia]].
The Party was founded in 1993 and has a constitution, which describes an organisation with the aim of endorsing candidates to contest elections to the Federal Parliament of Australia.

More recently, the [[HEMP Party]] (Help End Marijuana Prohibition) was first registered in 2000, and then de-registered in 2006 under Schedule 3 of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Act 2006. During that time candidates stood in state and federal elections. Since that time it has been difficult to prove a membership of 500, as members contacted by the AEC ([[Australian Electoral Commission]]) sometimes disavowed membership, or had changed address without notifying the Party or the AEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianhempparty.com/ |title=Help End Marijuana Prohibition: HEMP Party |publisher=Australianhempparty.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several applications later the AEC has assessed the party as meeting the test of being a political party under s4 of the Electoral Act. On 17 June 2010 the delegate determined that the party's application had passed its initial consideration for registration and the application was advertised for public objection on 23 June 2010. The issue of writs on 19 July 2010 for the federal elections meant that no further action could be taken on this application until the final return of all outstanding writs on 17 September 2010. No objections to the registration of the HEMP Party were received. The AEC assessed the party's application against the technical requirements in s126(2) of the Electoral Act. The application meets the technical requirements in s126(2). The delegate of the Australian Electoral Commission determined that the HEMP Party should therefore be registered under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/party_registration/Registration_Decisions/3788.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In [[Canada]], the [[Marijuana Party of Canada]] was launched by Marc-Boris St-Maurice in February 2000. The party is seen as a follow up to the [[Quebec|Québécois]] [[Bloc pot]], in order to work at the federal level. There are also other party organizations at the provincial level. The [[Liberal Party of Canada]] adopted a pot legalization policy at their recent party convention.

===Saskatchewan===
The [[Saskatchewan Marijuana Party]]&lt;ref&gt;See ''[http://www.saskmp.ca The Saskatchewan Marijuana Party]''&lt;/ref&gt; functions in a politically independent fashion, and does not hold any formal association to any other political organizations federally or provincially. On April 20 of 2006, the party submitted their petition of registration to elections Saskatchewan. The petition was successful and the party was fully registered as a political party in the province of Saskatchewan as of June 7, 2006.

The party leader is currently Nathan Holowaty. Nathan Holowaty has referred to himself as a socially responsible libertarian and believes in the full scale legalization of cannabis. Nathan has a degree in political studies from the [[University of Saskatchewan]].

===British Columbia===
In [[British Columbia]], the [[British Columbia Marijuana Party]] works independently from the Marijuana Party of Canada.

===Quebec===
In [[Quebec]], the ''[[Quebec|Québécois]]'' [[Bloc pot]], created by Marc-Boris St-Maurice, ran their first election campaign in 1998. In February 2000, the party launched the [[Marijuana Party of Canada]] which ran 73 candidates in the [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 federal election]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}  Bloc pot is now the provincial counterpart of the Marijuana Party of Canada.

==Denmark==
Political Parties in [[Folketinget]], which is the Danish parliament, who wants to legalize cannabis:

[[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]] are in favor of cannabis legalization. This is the case for both medical and recreational. "I want a state regulated sale of cannabis, like the state regulates alcohol and cigarrettes. That way, we have a better control of which drugs are on the market, and that they aren't sold to kids." - [[Christina Egelund]].

[[Alternativet]] are in factor of cannabis legalization. This is the case for both medical and recreational. "This is a great way to take a stand against criminal gangs, decriminalize normal Danes and to secure that there aren't any dangerous chemicals added." - [[Josephine Fock]].

[[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]] are in factor of a regulated legalization of cannabis. "Today, some people smoke way too much cannabis and get problems, but we doesn't help them by punishing them, when they in reality need help. We should treat cannabis like alcohol, and focus on the one's, who get addicted." - [[Lisbeth Bech Poulsen]].

After the incident at [[Freetown Christiania]], where the police destroyed all the stalls, and cleared them of cannabis, the [[Danish Social Liberal Party]] have chanced stance on this issue. They now want a 3-year trial, where you can buy state regulated cannabis across the country.

[[Red-Green Alliance]] wants to legalize cannabis sold and produced by the state. "It will secure that criminals can't make money off the import, nor make money off the illegal sale of cannabis. The money, the state makes off the sale, shall be used on information, treatment for the addicts and welfare benefits, instead of giving the money to the criminals" - [[Rune Lund]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/overblik-det-mener-partierne-om-legalisering-af-hash&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hampepartiet]] was formed in 2001.

==Greece==
As of 2015, there have been ongoing attempts for the establishment of the Cannabis Party of Greece, but they haven't resulted in the creation of a registered political party yet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zougla.gr/politiki/article/idriete-to-koma-kanavis-eladas&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israel==
[[File:Marijuana.jpg|thumb|Cannabis leaf]]
In [[Israel]], the [[Ale Yarok]] (''Green Leaf'') party participated in the past six  elections and came close to winning a [[Knesset]] seat.

==Ireland==
In [[Ireland]], there were attempts to establish a [[Cannabis legalisation Party]] however the government have so far refused to allow any such parties to be registered. A number of individuals including journalist [[Olaf Tyaransen]] and [[Phoenix Park]] festival organiser [[Ubi Dwyer]] have stood in various elections (national, Local and European) as independent candidates on a legalise cannabis platform. The only success to date has been the election of [[Luke 'Ming' Flanagan]] to [[The Dáil]] in the [[Irish general election, 2011|2011 General Election]] although it is generally accepted that Flannigan's success was also mainly due to his stance on other political issues.

==New Zealand==
In [[New Zealand]], the [[Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party]] ran for the first time in 1996. They have never had any Members of Parliament, but have averaged around 1% of the popular vote - one fifth of what is necessary to gain MPs under New Zealand's proportional representation system. A former member, [[Nándor Tánczos]], was an MP as part of the [[New Zealand Green Party]] (1999–2008). (He was also New Zealand's first ever [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] Member of Parliament). The party had candidates in the [[New Zealand general election, 2008|2008 general election]].

The [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand]] has said that if it forms a government in the [[New Zealand general election, 2017|2017 election]] it will [[Cannabis in New Zealand|legalise cannabis]]. 'Under its proposal, people would be able to legally grow and possess marijuana for personal use'. The party would also 'urgently amend the law so sick people using medicinal marijuana were not penalised'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/87388713/legal-cannabis-in-nz-green-party-offers-green-light-to-pot-smokers Legal cannabis in NZ?

The former leader of the [[ACT Party]] [[Don Brash]] has spoken out in favour of decriminalizing cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://act.org.nz/news/law-and-order-protecting-new-zealanders-from-crime |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711042422/http://act.org.nz/news/law-and-order-protecting-new-zealanders-from-crime |archivedate=2012-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norway==
On 22 September 2009, the political party DnC or [[Det norske Cannabispartiet]] was registered in Stavanger by Even Ganja Helland and Sigbjørn Eskeland, both from Jørpeland, Norway.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Spain==
In [[Spain]], the [[Partido Cannabis]] participated in the [[Spanish general election, 2004]], by standing candidates for seats in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] in three provinces, ([[Valencia (province)|Valencia]], [[Alicante (province)|Alicante]] and [[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]]). They scored between 0.35% and 1.11% of votes cast.

==South Africa==
The nationally registered political party Iqela Lentsango: The [[Dagga Party]] of South Africa is South Africa's first and foremost Cannabis legalization group. This group are also activists and supporters of people arrested, charged and/or imprisoned for the possession of dagga (the South Africa word for Cannabis) and related charges.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Daggaparty/?hc_ref=SEARCH&amp;fref=nf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://roodepoortrecord.co.za/2016/09/05/daggaspringbok-the-dagga-party-of-south-africa-enters-the-fray/&lt;/ref&gt;

Also deserving of mention is Dr. Mario Oriani-Ambrosini. A Member of Parliament in South Africa, he was diagnosed with cancer and subsequently began lobbying for the legalization of Medical Marijuana. He went so far as to address the entire Parliament sitting in Cape Town with an impassioned plea for the Members of Parliament to consider the legalization of Medical Marijuana. He died shortly after this but thanks to him and other activists, South Africa seems to be heading in the direction of eventually legalizing Cannabis for medical use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ifp-welcomes-giant-step-forward-for-medical-cannabis-use-20161124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/ill-mp-to-introduce-dagga-bill-1649727#.UwWvfYV8rIg&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Legalise Cannabis Alliance]] (LCA), registered as a political party from 1999 to 2006, with Alun Buffry as its leader-for-the-purpose-of-registration-only, fielding candidates in elections to the [[House of Commons (UK)|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and to local government councils. The LCA de-registered itself as a political party, and continues to work as a pressure group.

The party drew inspiration from the performances of [[Howard Marks]] and Buster Nolan as independent ''legalise cannabis'' candidates in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]]. (Howard Marks stood in four different [[constituencies]] of the House of Commons.) The LCC, Legalise Cannabis Campaign, founded in the late 60s acted as a pressure group throughout the 1970s and 80s and provided a seedbed of support for these later political manifestations.

By the time of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]] the party had experience of campaigns in two House of Commons [[by-election]]s and various local government elections. In the general election the party contested 13 constituencies and their share of the vote ranged from 1.1% to 2.5%.

In January 2004, cannabis prohibition in the UK was relaxed. Cannabis had been a class B substance under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]. It became a class C substance, and many people saw this change as virtual 'decriminalisation'. It was a long way short of full legalisation. It has recently returned to a class B substance.

The LCA contested 21 constituencies in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]]. Their share of the vote ranged from 0.6% to 1.8%, falling significantly from its previous levels, presumably because [[Cannabis reclassification in the United Kingdom|reclassification of cannabis]] had made the case for legalisation less pressing.

The de-registered, Legalise Cannabis Alliance, adopted a new identity as [[Cannabis Law Reform|CLEAR - Cannabis Law Reform]], in 2011. Upon this identity change there was also a change of policy, spokespersons, logo, emblems, fliers and aims. CLEAR was a registered political party from 2011–2013. The organisation now works as a lobby group.

[[Cannabis Is Safer Than Alcohol]] (CISTA) was a political party founded in 2015. In the 2015 General Election they campaigned for a [[Royal Commission]] to review the UK's drug laws relating to cannabis. CISTA is for harm reduction.&lt;ref&gt;http://cista.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The party was deregistered by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] on 3 November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Registrations/PP2552 Cannabis is Safer than Alcohol [De-registered 03/11/16&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]. The Electoral Commission. Retrieved 8 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], [[Green Party of England and Wales]] and [[Scottish Green Party]] all support the legalisation of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libdems.org.uk/liberal_democrats_call_for_a_legalised_cannabis_market# Liberal Democrats call for a legalised cannabis market].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2022">'''Capital punishment''' is abolished in the U.S. state of '''Maine'''.

Between 1644 and 1885, 21 people were executed in Maine.  Ten of these executions were carried out before [[U.S. state|statehood]] (gained on March 15, 1820), and eleven after. [[Hanging]] was the only method of execution.

All but two executed people were males. The first person executed in Maine, sometime in 1644, was Mrs. Cornish. Also, 23-year-old [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] Patience Sampson was hanged on July 31, 1735.

Sixteen of those executed were white, two were Native American, and three were [[African American]].

All but one of the death sentences actually carried out were imposed for [[murder]]. Only Jeremiah Baum, executed sometime in 1780, was put to death for [[treason]].

A 40-year-old escaped convict, [[Daniel Wilkinson (murderer)|Daniel Wilkinson]], was the last person executed in Maine. He was hanged on November 21, 1885 for the murder of police constable William Lawrence.

The death penalty in Maine was officially abolished in 1887, just two years after Wilkinson's execution.

'''City Environmental Quality Review''' ('''CEQR''') is a process [[New York City]] agencies must undergo to determine if any discretionary action they approved has any deteriorating impact on the environment.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/site/oec/environmental-quality-review/ceqr-basics.page|title=CEQR Basics - OEC|last=NYC|first=Office of Environmental Coordination|date=|website=www1.nyc.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects that have to be reviewed by CEQR are either in need of permits or approval from a city agency, need city funding, or are directly undertaken by a city agency.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/site/oec/environmental-quality-review/ceqr-faqs-general.page|title=CEQR FAQs - General - OEC|last=NYC|first=Office of Environmental Coordination|date=|website=www1.nyc.gov|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1973, New York City put into place Executive Order No. 87, meaning that any city project being implemented must be assessed for the impact it could have on the environment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/site/oec/environmental-quality-review/ceqr-laws-regulations.page#resources|title=CEQR Laws &amp; Regulations - OEC|last=NYC|first=Office of Environmental Coordination|date=|website=www1.nyc.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative was in response to the country's [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA), which was enacted in 1970 and was one of the first national laws dedicated to protecting the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-national-environmental-policy-act|title=Summary of the National Environmental Policy Act|last=EPA, OA, OP, ORPM, RMD|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing after that, in 1975 the State of New York put into place the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQR). SEQR required that state and local government agencies must review the environmental impact of any discretionary action before funding or approving that action.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

From the SEQR came the CEQR in 1977. SEQR regulations allowed local governments to create their own environmental review procedures. Through the Executive Order No. 91, CEQR was established in New York City and so was the creation of a two co-lead agency system that would handle most of the environmental review functions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, in 1991 the two co-lead agency system was replaced by a new system of lead agencies, where City agencies would act as the lead agency to any projects they wished to fund or implement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Environmental review process==
An environmental review process starts when an agency proposes a project. In addition to the proposal, the agency must have a completed list of any permits, approvals, or funding needed to complete the project.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The list will help guide the CEQR process; determining how intensely the CEQR process must be, or if a CEQR is even needed for a project.

Once the CEQR process begins, it is separated into two stages. The first stage is an initial assessment, known as the [[Environmental Assessment]] Statement (EAS), which discloses the description of the project and any potential impacts it could have.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/site/oec/environmental-quality-review/ceqr-faqs-procedures.page|title=CEQR FAQs - Procedures - OEC|last=NYC|first=Office of Environmental Coordination|date=|website=www1.nyc.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EAS is then reviewed for any significant impacts that could arise and if any are found, the lead agency declares an [[Environmental impact statement|Environmental Impact Statement]] (EIS) to be completed, which analyzes the impacts described in the EAS.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

During the review, projects can be categorized into several defining labels. One label is '''Project Development,''' where the project is still being defined and the data is being gathered before the CEQR process. Another label is '''Active''', where the CEQR process is in progress. '''On Hold,''' where the review has been suspended. '''Complete''', when the CEQR process is completed. '''Withdrawn''', where an applicant withdraws the review. '''Terminated''', when the review, after 6 months of inactivity, becomes canceled. And '''Monitoring''', when a project, which has completed the CEQR process, is tracked, making sure guidelines are being followed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Environmental aspects==
When conducting the review, CEQR takes the following areas into account for their assessment:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Land Use, Zoning, and Public Policy
* Socioeconomic Conditions
* Community Facilities and Services
* Open Space
* Shadows
* Historic and Cultural Resources
* Urban Design and Visual Resources
* Natural Resources
* Hazardous Materials
* Infrastructure
* Solid Waste and Sanitation Services
* Energy
* Transportation
* Air Quality
* Greenhouse Gas Emissions
* Noise
* Public Health
* Neighborhood Character
* Construction Impacts

{{Policy Debate}} 
In [[policy debate]], a '''disadvantage''' (abbreviated as '''DA''', and sometimes referred to as:  '''Disad''') is an argument that a team brings up against a policy action that is being considered.

==Structure==
A Disadvantage usually has four key elements. These four elements are not always necessary depending on the type of disadvantage run, and some are often combined into a single piece of evidence. A Unique Link card, for example, will include both a description of the status quo and the plan's effect on it. A traditional threshold DA, however, has a structure as follows:

===Uniqueness===

Uniqueness shows why the Impacts have not occurred yet or to a substantial extent and will ''uniquely'' occur with the adoption of either the Affirmative's plan or the Negative's counterplan.

Example: If the negative team argues that the affirmative plan will result in nuclear proliferation, it would also argue that the status quo will avoid nuclear proliferation.  If the Affirmative claims that nuclear proliferation is already occurring, the negative team could argue that adoption of the plan would result in a ''unique'' increase in nuclear proliferation.  If the plan causes no net change in the rate of nuclear proliferation, the disadvantage is not unique to the plan, and therefore not relevant.

===External links===
For the disadvantage to have relevance in the round, the negative team must show that the affirmative plan causes the disadvantage that is claimed.  If the DA stated that the plan takes money from the government, and the affirmative team shows that the plan does not increase governmental spending, then the DA would be considered to have "no link".

===Internal link===

The internal link connects the link to the impact, or, it shows the steps the link causes to get to the impact. Not all DA's use an internal link but some have multiple internals. The internal link in our example would be that government spending leads to economic collapse.

===Impact===
The impact is the result of the policy action that make it undesirable. These results are at the end of the chain of reasoning of your DA (starts with your link with internal links spanning over the Brink with Uniqueness and lead to the Impact), then continuing along with the example, an impact would be that economic collapse may cause [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. The Impact is the edge of the sword of your DA and is usually a significantly bad event caused by inertia evident through the internal links inside the link off over the brink and uniquely so.

Internal links are often undesirable things by themselves, and could be considered impacts.  However, the worst of the consequences, or the final one in the chain of events, is usually given the label of "impact".  For example, nuclear war is probably worse than economic collapse, so nuclear war is given the "impact" label, even though economic collapse (the internal link) could itself be viewed as an impact.

The nuclear war impact is the terminal (i.e. final) impact in virtually every disadvantage today. While it appears outlandish to outsiders and even to some debaters now, it originated in the 1980s during the height of the [[nuclear freeze]] movement, specifically after the publication of ''[[The Fate of the Earth]]'' by [[Jonathan Schell]]. Barring nuclear war, the terminal impact usually ends up as [[extinction]] anyway, either [[human extinction]] or the extinction of all life on Earth; the most common mechanisms for these are cataclysmic climatic change (in the style of ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''), or uncontrolled undiscovered uncurable disease. Most debate coaches use the nuclear war argument as  away of training young policy debaters.

Other terminal impacts might include severe human rights abuses, such as near universal slavery or loss of individuality.  These types of impacts are usually argued under a [[deontological]] framework or as a turn to a human rights advantage.

==Types of disadvantages==

===Traditional===
A traditional DA follows the structure above.  Traditional DA's can include or exclude the internal link.

===Linear===
A linear disadvantage does not have uniqueness.  The negative concedes that the status quo has a problem but insists the plan increases that problem's severity. A commonly accepted theory holds that a sufficiently philosophical linear disadvantage with an alternative becomes a [[kritik]]. There is also much controversy over kritiks being linear disadvantages, due to the fact that most kritik argue the affirmative plan over a discursive level, while a disadvantage argues the affirmative's actions.

Non-kritikal linear disadvantages frequently face attacks from the Affirmative on debate theory; the theory that linear disadvantages are abusive (i.e. unfair) to the affirmative team has much popularity.

===Brink===
A brink disadvantage is a special type of linear disadvantage which claims that the affirmative will aggravate the problem in the status quo to the extent that it passes a brink, at which time the impact happens all at once. The negative team claims that in the status quo, we are near the brink, but the affirmative team's plan will push us "over the edge."

===Politics disadvantage===
A politics disadvantage is unique in the way that it links to affirmative plan . Rather than linking to the specific plan action, it links to the fact that a plan passes at all. Politics disadvantages typically will say that a plan will pass through Congress, thus causing a shift in the "political capital" of either the President, or a political party, which will affect
the ability of the affected group to pass other bills. An example of a politics disadvantage would be: Uniqueness: Immigration Reform will pass in the status quo. Link: Plan decreases the President's political capital, perhaps with a specific link that increasing civil liberties would be a flip-flop for President Obama. Thus, Obama has no political capital to pass his Immigration Reform. Impact elections cycles. For example, in a presidential election, it might argue that a certain Presidential candidate or his or her opponent is currently weak (or strong), but the affirmative plan will cause him or her to gain (or lose) popularity, and that either his or her election is undesirable or the election of his or her opponent is undesirable.  A midterms version could focus on particular races or the general balance of the Congress; an example of a single-race midterms disadvantage would be that the reelection of Senator [[Daniel Akaka]] is critical to [[free speech]], and plan prevents Akaka from winning; a "balance of Congress" disadvantage might hold that the plan is a credit to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], who would increase their grip on Congress and allow extensive drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]].

====Controversy====
 on the disadvantage. Supporters, however, say the politics disadvantages are "real world" and provide education on how bills are passed and politics in general.

Other debate theorists have recently created a model of [[fiat (policy debate)|fiat]] that appears to preclude the politics disadvantage; however, its use in any given debate round is entirely dependent on how well the affirmative argues that the judge should accept the model, a somewhat time-consuming process. Examples of these fiat arguments include Vote No and Intrinsicness. Vote No says that the debate should be a simulation of the debate before congress therefore the president has already exerted political capital meaning there is no disadvantage. Intrinsicness, popularized by New Trier Coach Michael Greenstein, says that there is no reason that congress can't pass both the plan and the bill meaning they aren't competitive.
.

===Other types of D/As===
Tradeoff DA - plan takes money from more important things

Economy/Spending DA - plan leads to economy collapse/recession
- Biscon: Plan actually or perceptually harms business
- Spending: Plan costs too much money causing the dollar to lose value. A more nuanced version of this argument focuses on rather invistors will buy our t-bills or if a credit agency will downgrade our credit.

Federalism DA - aka the "fism DA" - says that plan = undermine federalism (balance of powers between USFG and states), and since most countries model their democracy on the US, if the US destroys their federalism, then wars will break out in other countries as a result

Constitutionality DA - plan = unconstitutional, and creating it would set a bad precedent, causing other unconstitutional policies to be passed

Overpopulation or "Malthus DA" DA - By the plan saving lives, it undermines natural death checks, which lead to overpopulation and a "Malthusian" catastrophe because of it

Relation Disadvantages: Plan harms our relationship with another nation

==Responding to disadvantages==
Disadvantage responses can generally be classified into two categories: '''takeouts''', which simply seek to refute a claim made by the negative in the disadvantage, and '''[[Turn (policy debate)|turns]]''', which argue that the situation is somehow the reverse of the negative's claim.

===Takeouts===

====Non-unique====

The "non-unique" argument says that the impact will happen in the status quo with or without the passage of the plan or that it is happening in the status quo. The links and impacts (and thus the entire disadvantage) become largely irrelevant since the status quo is no different from the plan.

====No link====
A very simple argument. The affirmative simply claims that the plan does not cause the impact.

An example:

*'''Uniqueness:''' The United States-India nuclear deal is likely to pass now, but just barely. It requires extensive expenditure of limited [[political capital]].
*'''Link:''' The plan uses political capital that would otherwise be used for passage of the deal.
*'''Internal Link:''' Failure to pass the deal will reduce American influence on the [[Indian subcontinent]].
*'''Internal Link:''' Reduction of American influence on the Indian subcontinent will lead to nuclear war between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]].
*'''Impact''': India-Pakistan nuclear war will spiral out of control into a global nuclear conflict.

'''No Link:''' The plan expends no political capital

====No internal link====
A variant on the No Link, it states that either the link or the previous internal link does not lead to another internal link.

Using the example above, a no-internal-link could either be that the failure to pass the deal will not reduce American influence on the Indian subcontinent, or that reduction of American influence on the Indian subcontinent will not lead to nuclear war between India and Pakistan.

====Impact uniqueness====
Arguing the impact's uniqueness is an underused but effective argument. To prove that an impact is non-unique the affirmative must show that the link has already happened in the past but the impact didn't happen.

For example:

Uniqueness: American oil consumption high now!

Link: Ethanol trades off with oil!

Internal: OPEC will flood the market with cheap oil

Impact: Destroys Russian and Canadian Economies—global economic collapse—Nuclear war!

Impact Uniqueness—OPEC flooded the market last year with really cheap oil and there was no nuclear war

===Turns===

====Link Turn====
The Link Turn is generally accepted to be a better attack on a disadvantage than the defensive take-out arguments, as it is an [[Offense and Defense (policy debate)|offensive argument]]. The link-turn is in two parts: a card that says the disadvantage is non-unique(the impact is going to happen in the status quo)--and reading a link-turn (a piece of evidence that states the plan does the opposite of what the negative link says).

For Example:

'''Original DA'''

'''Uniqueness:''' US Military Strong

'''Link:''' Plan Decreases military power

'''Impact:''' Weak military leads to nuclear conflict.

A non-unique and a link turn would go something like this:

'''Non-unique:''' Military weak now.

'''Link Turn:''' Plan increases military power.

This strategy turns what was previously a "disadvantage" to the plan into a benefit or advantage of the plan. This helps the affirmative debaters prove that they should win on presumption(that the aff plan is proven to be the better policy option than the status quo).

====Impact turn====
Another way to debate against a disadvantage is an impact turn, in which the affirmative team reads evidence stating that the disadvantages impact would actually be good or that the status quo creates a worse impact. If the impact to a disad was global nuclear war, an impact turn would say that death is good or that the status quo creates a bigger nuclear war.  Often impact turns function at the level above this.  The argument is then sometimes called an internal link turn.  For example, if the disadvantage argued that the plan hurt free trade, which was key to avoiding war, the affirmative might argue that in fact free trade caused war, environmental destruction, and other negative consequences.  This type of turn is often much harder to convince the judge of (in part because of the [[Structure of policy debate|structure]] of a debate round, in particular, the negative block), but some believe that it makes a round much more interesting.

====Straight turn====
One strategy the affirmative may use in order to attack the Disadvantage is to "straight turn it." To straight turn something means to run only offensive arguments against it. Such an example would be to run 3 impact turns against a Disadvantage. This forces the negative team to not kick the Disadvantage because it automatically becomes an extra advantage for the affirmative. If the affirmative did run defensive arguments such as non-unique and an impact turn, then the negative could concede that it is non-unique so the impact turn would be rendered useless thus the negative could kick out of the disadvantage.

The affirmative team should never run an impact turn and a link turn together—this is called double turning. When the affirmative team double turns themself they claim that "right now the status quo is doing something, and the affirmative plan stops it, but what the affirmative stops is a good thing." In simple terms, the affirmative runs a disadvantage on themselves.

====Other ways to answer a disadvantage====
In answering the Link, an affirmative might argue that the link has '''no threshold''', i.e. that the link does not make clear when the impact will happen or even that the impact will happen solely based on what the affirmative plan causes. Or the aff may claim that '''uniqueness overwhelms the link'''; that conditions in the status quo are so far away from the threshold that the impact will not happen.  This second answer is rarely made however, because it is a strategic gamble.

A disadvantage can also be answered by no longer doing a part of the plan that causes the aff to link into the disadvantage.  This is often referred to as a severance perm, because by making this claim the affirmative does all parts of the plan except the part that links to the disadvantage, thus severing out of part of their own plan.  This argument is also rarely made, due to the theory arguments it brings up on the affirmative changing its plan in the round in order to avoid the disadvantage.

Also if the negative runs a Counterplan in addition to the Disadvantage (which commonly occurs) the affirmative can make a permutation and say that the combination of the counterplan and plan shields the link to the disadvantage. For example: the plan repeals the Hyde Amendment to allow abortion funding through federal sources by using congress; the negative runs a courts counterplan that repels the hyde amendment and runs a politics disadvantage that says the plan will drain the political capital of the president which causes a certain bill not to be passed; the affirmative would claim that the "perm shields the link" because congress would claim that the courts made them repeal the hyde amendment, therefore no political capital would be lost.

[[File:DCFM Calculator.JPG|thumb|Spreadsheet uses [[Free cash flow]]s to estimate stock's [[Fair Value]] and measure the sensibility of [[Weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] and [[Perpetual growth]] ]]

In [[finance]], '''discounted cash flow''' ('''DCF''') analysis is a method of valuing a project, company, or [[financial asset|asset]] using the concepts of the [[time value of money]]. All future [[cash flow]]s are estimated and [[Discounting|discounted]] by using cost of capital to give their [[present value]]s (PVs). The sum of all future cash flows, both incoming and outgoing, is the [[net present value]] (NPV), which is taken as the value of the cash flows in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wallstreetoasis.com/finance-dictionary/what-is-a-discounted-cash-flow-DCF|title = Wall Street Oasis (DCF)|date = |accessdate = 5 February 2015|website = Wall Street Oasis|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using DCF analysis to compute the NPV takes as input cash flows and a discount rate and gives as output a present value The opposite process takes cash flows and a price (present value) as inputs, and provides as output the discount rate; this is used in bond markets to obtain the [[Yield (finance)|yield]].

Discounted cash flow analysis is widely used in investment finance, [[real estate developer|real estate development]], [[corporate financial]] management and [[patent valuation]].  It was used in industry as early as the 1700s or 1800s, widely discussed in financial economics in the 1960s, and became widely used in U.S. Courts in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simkovic|first1=Michael|title=The Evolution of Valuation in Bankruptcy|journal=American Bankruptcy Law Journal|date=2017|ssrn=2810622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discount rate==
{{main|Discounting}}
The most widely used method of [[discounting]] is exponential discounting, which values future cash flows as "how much money would have to be invested currently, at a given rate of return, to yield the cash flow in future." Other methods of discounting, such as [[hyperbolic discounting]], are studied in academia and said to reflect intuitive decision-making, but are not generally used in industry.

The discount rate used is generally the appropriate [[weighted average cost of capital]] (WACC), that reflects the risk of the cash flows. This WACC can be found using Perry's calculation model which was developed in 1996. The discount rate reflects two things:

# Time value of money ([[Risk-free interest rate|risk-free rate]]) – according to the theory of [[time preference]], investors would rather have cash immediately than having to wait and must therefore be compensated by paying for the delay
# [[Risk premium]] – reflects the extra return investors demand because they want to be compensated for the risk that the cash flow might not materialize after all

==History==
Discounted cash flow calculations have been used in some form since money was first lent at interest in ancient times. Studies of ancient Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics suggest that they used techniques similar to discounting of the future cash flows. This method of asset valuation differentiated between the accounting book value, which is based on the amount paid for the asset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = O.E.H. Neugebaner, The Exact Sciences in Antiquity (Copenhagen :Ejnar Mukaguard, 1951) p.33|last = O.E.H. Neugebaner, The Exact Sciences in Antiquity (Copenhagen :Ejnar Mukaguard, 1951) p.33|first = |publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1969|isbn = 0486223329|location = US|pages = 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the stock market crash of 1929, discounted cash flow analysis gained popularity as a valuation method for stocks. [[Irving Fisher]] in his 1930 book ''The Theory of Interest'' and [[John Burr Williams]]'s 1938 text ''[[The Theory of Investment Value]]'' first formally expressed the DCF method in modern economic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Irving. "The theory of interest." ''New York'' 43 (1930).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics==

===Discounted cash flows===
The discounted cash flow formula is derived from the [[future value]] formula for calculating the [[time value of money]] and compounding returns.

:&lt;math&gt;DCF = \frac{CF_1}{(1+r)^1} + \frac{CF_2}{(1+r)^2} + \dotsb +
\frac{CF_n}{(1+r)^n}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;FV = DCF \cdot (1+r)^n&lt;/math&gt;
Thus the discounted present value (for one cash flow in one future period) is expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;DPV =  \frac{FV}{(1+r)^n}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* ''DPV'' is the discounted present value of the future cash flow (''FV''), or ''FV'' adjusted for the delay in receipt;
* ''FV'' is the nominal value of a cash flow amount in a future period;
* ''r'' is the interest rate or discount rate, which reflects the cost of tying up capital and may also allow for the risk that the payment may not be received in full;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.gov.uk/sib_knowledge_box/discount-rates-and-net-present-value |title=Discount rates and net present value |publisher=Centre for Social Impact Bonds |accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''n'' is the time in years before the future cash flow occurs.

Where multiple cash flows in multiple time periods are discounted, it is necessary to sum them as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;DPV = \sum_{t=0}^{N} \frac{FV_t}{(1+r)^{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

for each future cash flow (''FV'') at any time period (''t'') in years from the present time, summed over all time periods. The sum can then be used as a [[net present value]] figure. If the amount to be paid at time&amp;nbsp;0 (now) for all the future cash flows is known, then that amount can be substituted for ''DPV'' and the equation can be solved for ''r'', that is the [[internal rate of return]].

All the above assumes that the interest rate remains constant throughout the whole period.

If the cash flow stream is assumed to continue indefinitely, the finite forecast is usually combined with the assumption of constant cash flow growth beyond the discrete projection period. The total value of such cash flow stream is the sum of the finite discounted cash flow forecast and the [[Terminal value (finance)]].

===Continuous cash flows===
For continuous cash flows, the summation in the above formula is replaced by an integration:

:&lt;math&gt;DPV= \int_0^T  FV(t) \, e^{-\lambda t} dt = \int_0^T \frac{FV(t)}{(1 + r)^t} \, dt\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;FV(t)&lt;/math&gt; is now the ''rate'' of cash flow, and &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \log(1+r)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example DCF==
To show how discounted cash flow analysis is performed, consider the following example.

: John Doe buys a house for $100,000. Three years later, he expects to be able to sell this house for $150,000.

Simple subtraction suggests that the value of his profit on such a transaction would be $150,000 − $100,000 = $50,000, or 50%. If that $50,000 is [[amortization (business)|amortized]] over the three years, his implied annual return (known as the [[internal rate of return]]) would be about 14.5%. Looking at those figures, he might be justified in thinking that the purchase looked like a good idea.

1.145&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; x $100,000 = $150,000, approximately.

However, since three years have passed between the purchase and the sale, any cash flow from the sale must be discounted accordingly. At the time John Doe buys the house, the 3-year [[United States Treasury security#Treasury note|US Treasury Note]] rate is 5% per annum. Treasury Notes are generally considered to be inherently less risky than real estate, since the value of the Note is guaranteed by the US Government and there is a [[liquidity|liquid]] market for the purchase and sale of T-Notes. If he hadn't put his money into buying the house, he could have invested it in the relatively safe T-Notes instead. This 5% per annum can, therefore, be regarded as the [[risk-free interest rate]] for the relevant period (3 years).

Using the DPV formula above (FV=$150,000, i=0.05, n=3), that means that the value of $150,000 received in three years actually has a [[present value]] of $129,576 (rounded off). In other words, we would need to invest $129,576 in a T-Bond now to get $150,000 in 3 years almost risk-free. This is a quantitative way of showing that money in the future is not as valuable as money in the present ($150,000 in 3 years isn't worth the same as $150,000 now; it is worth $129,576 now).

Subtracting the purchase price of the house ($100,000) from the [[present value]] results in the [[net present value]] of the whole transaction, which would be $29,576 or a little more than 29% of the purchase price.

Another way of looking at the deal as the excess return achieved (over the risk-free rate) is (114.5 - 105)/(100 + 5) or approximately 9.0% (still very respectable).

But what about risk?

We assume that the $150,000 is John's best estimate of the sale price that he will be able to achieve in 3 years time (after deducting all expenses). There is a lot of uncertainty about house prices, and the outcome may end up higher or lower than this estimate.

(The house John is buying is in a "good neighborhood," but market values have been rising quite a lot lately and the real estate market analysts in the media are talking about a slow-down and higher interest rates. There is a probability that John might not be able to get the full $150,000 he is expecting in three years due to a slowing of price appreciation, or that loss of liquidity in the real estate market might make it very hard for him to sell at all.)

Under normal circumstances, people entering into such transactions are risk-averse, that is to say that they are prepared to accept a lower expected return for the sake of avoiding risk. See [[Capital asset pricing model]] for a further discussion of this. For the sake of the example (and this is a gross simplification), let's assume that he values this particular risk at 5% per annum (we could perform a more precise probabilistic analysis of the risk, but that is beyond the scope of this article). Therefore, allowing for this risk, his expected return is now 9.0% per annum (the arithmetic is the same as above).

And the excess return over the risk-free rate is now (109 - 105)/(100 + 5) which comes to approximately 3.8% per annum.

That return rate may seem low, but it is still positive after all of our discounting, suggesting that the investment decision is probably a good one: it produces enough profit to compensate for tying up capital and incurring risk with a little extra left over. When investors and managers perform DCF analysis, the important thing is that the net present value of the decision after discounting all future cash flows at least be positive (more than zero). If it is negative, that means that the investment decision would actually ''lose'' money even if it appears to generate a nominal profit. For instance, if the expected sale price of John Doe's house in the example above was not $150,000 in three years, but ''$130,000'' in three years or $150,000 in ''five'' years, then on the above assumptions buying the house would actually cause John to ''lose'' money in present-value terms (about $3,000 in the first case, and about $8,000 in the second). Similarly, if the house was located in an undesirable neighborhood and the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] was about to raise interest rates by five percentage points, then the risk factor would be a lot higher than 5%: it might not be possible for him to predict a profit in discounted terms even if he thinks he could sell the house for ''$200,000'' in three years.

In this example, only one future cash flow was considered.  For a decision which generates multiple cash flows in multiple time periods, all the cash flows must be discounted and then summed into a single [[net present value]].

==Methods of appraisal of a company or project==
This is offered as a simple treatment of a complex subject. More detail is beyond the scope of this article.

For these valuation purposes, a number of different DCF methods are distinguished today, some of which are outlined below. The details are likely to vary depending on the [[capital structure]] of the company. However the assumptions used in the appraisal (especially the equity discount rate and the projection of the cash flows to be achieved) are likely to be at least as important as the precise model used.

Both the income stream selected and the associated [[cost of capital]] model determine the valuation result obtained with each method.
This is one reason these valuation methods are formally referred to as the Discounted Future Economic Income methods.

===Equity-approach===
* [[Flows to equity]] approach (FTE)
** Discount the cash flows available to the holders of equity capital, after allowing for cost of servicing debt capital
** Advantages: Makes explicit allowance for the cost of debt capital
** Disadvantages: Requires judgement on choice of discount rate

===Entity-approach===
* [[Adjusted present value]] approach (APV)
** Discount the cash flows before allowing for the debt capital (but allowing for the tax relief obtained on the debt capital)
** Advantages: Simpler to apply if a specific project is being valued which does not have earmarked debt capital finance
** Disadvantages: Requires judgement on choice of discount rate; no explicit allowance for cost of debt capital, which may be much higher than a [[risk-free rate]]
* [[Weighted average cost of capital]] approach (WACC)
** Derive a weighted cost of the capital obtained from the various sources and use that discount rate to discount the cash flows from the project
** Advantages: Overcomes the requirement for debt capital finance to be earmarked to particular projects
** Disadvantages: Care must be exercised in the selection of the appropriate income stream. The net cash flow to total invested capital is the generally accepted choice.
* [[Total cash flow]] approach (TCF){{Clarify|date=February 2009}}
** This distinction illustrates that the Discounted Cash Flow method can be used to determine the value of various business ownership interests. These can include equity or debt holders.
** Alternatively, the method can be used to value the company based on the value of total invested capital. In each case, the differences lie in the choice of the income stream and discount rate. For example, the net cash flow to total invested capital and WACC are appropriate when valuing a company based on the market value of all invested capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortcomings==

Commercial banks have widely used discounted cash flow as a method of valuing commercial real estate construction projects. This practice has two substantial shortcomings. 1) The discount rate assumption relies on the market for competing investments at the time of the analysis, which would likely change, perhaps dramatically, over time, and 2) straight line assumptions about income increasing over ten years are generally based upon historic increases in market rent but never factors in the cyclical nature of many real estate markets. Most loans are made during boom real estate markets and these markets usually last fewer than ten years. Using DCF to analyze commercial real estate during any but the early years of a boom market will lead to overvaluation of the asset.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Discounted cash flow models are powerful, but they do have shortcomings. DCF is merely a mechanical valuation tool, which makes it subject to the principle "[[garbage in, garbage out]]". Small changes in inputs can result in large changes in the value of a company. Instead of trying to project the cash flows to infinity, terminal value techniques are often used. A simple perpetuity is used to estimate the terminal value past 10 years, for example. This is done because it is harder to come to a realistic estimate of the cash flows as time goes on involves calculating the period of time likely to recoup the initial outlay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp |title=Discounted Cash Flow - DCF|publisher=investopedia.com |access-date=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another shortcoming is the fact that the Discounted Cash Flow Valuation should only be used as a method of intrinsic valuation for companies with predictable, though not necessarily stable, cash flows. The Discounted Cash Flow valuation method is widely used in valuing mature companies in stable industry sectors such as Utilities. At the same time, this method is often applied to valuation of high growth technology companies. In valuing young companies without much cash flow track record, the Discounted Cash Flow method may be applied a number of times to assess a number of possible future outcomes, such as the best, worst and mostly likely case scenarios.

=== Doesn't account for all variables ===
Traditional DCF calculations only consider the financial costs and benefits of a decision and do not not fully "capture the short- or long-term importance, value, or risks associated with natural and social capital"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Integrated Management: How Sustainability Creates Value for Any Business|last=Sroufe|first=Robert|publisher=Emerald Publishing|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; because they do not integrate the environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of an organization. Without a metric for measuring the short and long term environmental, social and governance performance of a firm, decision makers are planning for the future without considering the extent of the impacts associated with their decisions.

== Integrated Future Value (IntFV) ==
To address the lack of integration of the short and long term importance, value and risks associated with natural and social capital into the traditional DCF calculation, companies are valuing their environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance through an [[Integrated management|Integrated Management]] approach to reporting that expands DCF or Net Present Value to Integrated Future Value. This allows companies to value their investments not just for their financial return but also the long term environmental and social return of their investments. By highlighting environmental, social and governance performance in reporting, decision makers have the opportunity to identify new areas for value creation that are not revealed through traditional financial reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Report: Integrated Reporting for a Sustainable Strategy|last=Eccles|first=Robert|last2=Krzus|first2=Michael|publisher=Wiley|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[social cost of carbon]] is one value that can be incorporated into Integrated Future Value calculations to encompass the damage to society from greenhouse gas emissions that result from an investment. This is an integrated approach to reporting that supports Integrated Bottom Line (IBL) decision making, which takes [[triple bottom line]](TBL) a step further and combines financial, environmental and social performance reporting into one balance sheet. This approach provides decision makers with the insight to identify opportunities for value creation that promote growth and change within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sroufe|first=Robert|date=July 2017|title=Integration and Organizational Change Towards Sustainability|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318126290_Integration_and_Organizational_Change_Towards_Sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=162|pages=315-329|via=Research Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edith Irby Jones''' (born December 23, 1927) is an American physician who was the first [[African American]] to be accepted as a non-segregated student at the [[University of Arkansas]] Medical School and the first black student to attend racially mixed classes in the [[Southern United States|American South]]. She was the first African American to graduate from a southern medical school, first black intern in the state of Arkansas, and later first black intern at [[Baylor College of Medicine]]. Jones was the first woman president of the [[National Medical Association]]. She has been honored by many awards, including induction into both the University of Arkansas College of Medicine Hall of Fame and the inaugural group of women inducted into the [[Arkansas Women's Hall of Fame]].

==Biography==
Edith Mae Irby was born on December 23, 1927, near [[Conway, Arkansas|Conway]] in [[Faulkner County, Arkansas]], to Mattie (née Buice) and Robert Irby. At the age of eight, she lost her father, an older sister died at 12 years of age from [[typhoid fever]], and Irby herself suffered from [[rheumatic fever]] as a child. These were motivating factors in her desire to help those who were underserved and impoverished and which propelled her toward a career in medicine. Her mother relocated the family to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]], where Irby graduated from Langston Secondary School in 1944. After winning a scholarship, she studied chemistry, biology and physics at [[Knoxville College]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Edith Irby Jones|url=http://www.arwomenshalloffame.com/#/edith-jones/|publisher=Arkansas Women's Hall of Fame|accessdate=December 26, 2015|location=Little Rock, Arkansas|date=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irby was well aware of the role she was playing and obligation she had for the black community. One of her teachers had helped her attain the scholarship, members of the local African American community collected change and the black press ran a campaign in the ''[[Daisy Bates (civil rights activist)#Arkansas State Press|Arkansas State-Press]]'' which they donated to help with her tuition and living expenses.&lt;ref name="National Library of Medicine bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Edith Irby Jones|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_175.html|publisher=National Library of Medicine|accessdate=December 26, 2015|location=Bethesda, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her schooling, she secretly made trips with teams of workers from the [[NAACP]] to enroll members for the organization.{{sfn|More|1999|p=237}} She graduated with her BS from Knoxville College in 1948 and then completed a graduate course at [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]] to prepare for Medical School.&lt;ref name="graduation 1952"&gt;{{cite news|title=University to Graduate First Negro Student|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3893535/university_to_graduate_first_negro/|accessdate= December 26, 2015|work=Hope Star|date=May 19, 1952|location=Hope, Arkansas|page=3|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Endeavour Forum''' (originally '''Women Who Want to be Women''') is a conservative political organisation describing itself as "a Christian, pro-life, pro-family organisation that was founded to counter feminism, to defend the right to life of the unborn, and to support marriage and the natural family."  It was founded in 1979 by Babette Francis and has links to similar groups, such as the [[Australian Family Association]] and the [[World Congress of Families]].

The Endeavour Forum is listed on the ''Australian National Women's Register'' as a lobby group and as a women's rights organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE0738b.htm  |title=Australian National Women's Register |author=Carey, Jane|work=Australian National Women's Register|date=16 March 2004 |accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United States Fellowship of Reconciliation''' (FOR USA) was founded in 1915 by sixty-eight [[pacifism|pacifist]]s, including  [[A. J. Muste]],  [[Jane Addams]] and [[Paul Jones (bishop)|Bishop Paul Jones]], and claims to be the "largest, oldest interfaith peace and justice organization in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forusa.org/ |title=Fellowship of Reconciliation{{snd}}For a World of Peace, Justice and Nonviolence |publisher=Forusa.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norman Thomas]], at first skeptical of its program, joined in 1916 and would become the group's president. Its programs and projects involve domestic as well as international issues, and generally emphasize [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] alternatives to conflict and the rights of [[Conscientious objection|conscience]]. Unlike the U.K. movements, it is an interfaith body, though its historic roots are in Christianity.

== History ==
FOR in the USA was formed initially in opposition to the entry of the [[United States]] into [[World War I]]. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] developed out of FOR's [[conscientious objector]]s program and the Emergency Committee for [[Civil Liberties]].

In 1918, FOR and the [[American Federation of Labor]] formed [[Brookwood Labor College]], which lasted until 1937. Also in January 1918, FOR began publication of [[The World Tomorrow (magazine)|''The World Tomorrow'']], with Norman Thomas as its first editor.

National Secretary Paul Jones wrote in 1921 that the Fellowship of Reconciliation was established as one vehicle to aid in the application of Christian principles to "every problem of life."&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;Paul Jones, "The Fellowship of Reconciliation," ''The World Tomorrow'' [New York], vol. 4, no. 10 (Oct. 1921), p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the impossibility of harmonizing war with "the way of Christ," Jones stated that members of the organization had come to believe in the parallel necessity of a "reorganization of Society as will establish it on a Christian basis, so that no individual may be exploited for the profit or pleasure of another."&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt; Rather than the FOR itself serving as the primary fulcrum for this activity, "in general the members of the Fellowship endeavor to work out their aims through existing organizations and discussion," Jones noted.&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt;

[[John Nevin Sayre]] was active in FOR between 1924 and 1967, and was its chairman from 1935 to 1940.

From 1935 onwards, the US branch of FOR published a magazine, ''Fellowship''. ''Fellowship's'' contributors included
[[Mohandas Gandhi]], [[Vera Brittain]], [[Norman Thomas]], [[Oswald Garrison Villard]],
[[E. Stanley Jones]], [[Walter P. Reuther]] and  [[Muriel Lester]].&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement for "Fellowship",
in ''[[politics (magazine 1944-1949)|politics]]'' magazine, March 1947  (p. 46).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, FOR and the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], or CORE, which had been founded by FOR staffers [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|James Farmer]] and [[George Houser]] along with [[Bernice Fisher]], sponsored the [[Journey of Reconciliation]], the first [[Freedom Ride]] against southern [[Racial segregation|segregation]] in the wake of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] 1946 [[Irene Morgan]] decision.

In 1954, [[China]] was facing famine and the [[United States]] was enjoying surplus harvests, so the FOR organized the Surplus Food for China campaign to convince the government to send food to the Chinese.  

In 1955 and 1956, [[Glenn E. Smiley]], a white Methodist minister, was assigned by the FOR to assist the Rev. [[Martin Luther King]] in the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. The two, sitting behind the Rev. [[Ralph Abernathy]], were seatmates on the first interracial bus ride in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. Smiley and FoR executive secretary and director of publications [[Alfred Hassler]]&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;Forest, Jim (former FoR Publication Director). Comment on Ethan Persoff's blog (2011): "The author of the text and the man who had the idea for the comic was Al Hassler, executive secretary of the Fellowship on Reconciliation. He convinced comic artist Al Capp of the value of the project. Capp's studio did the drawings gratis."&lt;/ref&gt; later spearheaded FoR's production and distribution of the 1957 comic book ''[[Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story]]''.&lt;ref name=Aydin&gt;Aydin, Andrew. [http://clatl.com/atlanta/the-comic-book-that-changed-the-world/Content?oid=8807186&amp;showFullText=true "The comic book that changed the world: Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story's vital role in the Civil Rights Movement,"] ''Creative Loafing'' (Aug. 1, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, the organization's headquarters moved to [[Shadowcliff]] in [[Upper Nyack, New York]].&lt;ref name="NysNrhpNom"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cris.parks.ny.gov/ |title=Cultural Resource Information System (CRIS) |publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]] |format=Searchable database |accessdate=2015-12-01 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web|url=https://cris.parks.ny.gov/Uploads/ViewDoc.aspx?mode=A&amp;id=294765&amp;q=false |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Shadowcliff |accessdate=2015-12-01 |author=William E. Krattinger |format=PDF |date=October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shadowcliff was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/listings/20140418.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=2014-04-18|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 4/07/14 through 4/11/14|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, FOR launched "Shelters for the Shelterless," and built real shelters for homeless people, in response to increasing public demand for fallout shelters. FOR members such as [[Alfred Hassler]] made contact with the Vietnamese Buddhist pacifist movement and sponsored a world tour by Buddhist monk Thich [[Nhat Hanh]]. &lt;ref&gt;Mary Hershberger, 
''Traveling to Vietnam: American Peace Activists and the War''. Syracuse University Press, 1998 {{ISBN|081560517X}}, (pp. 21, 157) &lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, FOR founded Dai Dong, a transnational project linking war, environmental problems, poverty and other social issues, involving thousands of scientists around the world. They sought to reverse the Cold War and the arms race with campaigns, marches, educational projects and civil disobedience, and opposed the death penalty in a concerted campaign with ACLU.

Beginning in 1975, FOR supported [[Lee Stern]] as he helped found Children's Creative Response to Violence (CCRV) and the Alternatives to Violence Project (AVP). CCRV has had serious impact on K-8 education in the United States including introduction of the Peer Mediation Program. AVP seeks to build beloved community in prisons. For more than forty years it has worked with prison inmates to build spread peaceful community life in prison. In recent years, AVP has been the basis for building beloved communities in the Great Lakes Region of Africa.

In the 1980s, FOR took the lead in initiating the [[Nuclear Freeze]] Campaign in cooperation with other groups. They initiated a US-USSR reconciliation program, which included people-to-people exchanges, artistic and educational resources, teach-ins and conferences. They led nonviolence training seminars in the [[Philippines]] prior to the nonviolent overthrow of the Marcos dictatorship.

In the 1990s, the organization sent delegations of religious leaders and peace activists to Iraq to try to prevent war and later, to see the massive devastation caused by the economic sanctions imposed upon Iraq. They initiated a "Start the Healing" campaign in response to escalating levels of gun violence in the United States, and FOR is an organizational and founding member of the [[Coalition to Stop Gun Violence]], which advocates [[gun control]]. FOR initiated the "[[Bosnia]]n Student Project," which brought students from the former [[Yugoslavia]] out of war zones and into US homes and schools, and later started the International Reconciliation Work Camp Project. They also worked to get the US military to withdraw from Panama. 

FOR has most recently been active in advocating for the demilitarization of US foreign policy. It works to counter military recruitment of young people in the United States{{snd}}through FOR's [http://archives.forusa.org/groups/campaigns/i-will-not-kill "I Will Not Kill"] campaign, and in partnership with the [[Ruckus Society]], the [[War Resisters League]], and others in the Not Your Soldier project. A July 2016 action in Minneapolis, in response to the death of [[Philando Castile]], included the statement "Among their demands are the dismantling of the police department . . . disarming, defunding, demilitarizing, and disbanding police."&lt;ref&gt;Arrested in MN for Black Lives Matter [http://forusa.org/blog.php?i=58 FOR press release] July 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Particular areas of geographic focus have been the Middle East{{snd}}especially Israel/Palestine and Iran{{snd}}and Latin America and the Caribbean{{snd}}especially [[Colombia]] and [[Puerto rico|Puerto Rico]]. In the Middle East, FOR's Interfaith Peace-Builders program (now independent) builds relationships between Israeli, Palestinian, and North American peace activists. Founded in 2005, its Iran program has drawn on FOR's legacy of sending delegations to nations that are labeled as enemies by the US government, and is working to prevent war and create peace-centered connections between ordinary citizens of both countries. In the Americas, FOR has a permanent five-person Colombia peace team of volunteers who provide human rights accompaniment to endangered civilians and support locally organized peace initiatives. FOR was also instrumental in the movement to pressure the [[United States Navy in Vieques, Puerto Rico|US Navy to stop using Vieques as a bombing range]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6018">'''Fiscalism''' is a term sometimes used to refer the [[economic]] [[theory]] that the [[government]] should rely on [[fiscal policy]] as the main instrument of [[macroeconomic]] policy.  Fiscalism in this sense is contrasted with [[monetarism]],&lt;ref&gt;"monetarist-fiscalist controversy", Martín Bronfenbrenner, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=z2nWAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Fiscalism&amp;dq=Fiscalism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BlrdS76gDZKcmAPN0pTWBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ Macroeconomic alternatives]'', AHM Pub. Corp., 1979&lt;/ref&gt; which is associated with reliance on [[monetary policy]]. Fiscalists reject monetarism in a non-convertible floating rate system as inefficient if not also ineffective &lt;ref&gt;http://mikenormaneconomics.blogspot.cz/2011/08/monetarism-v-fiscalism.html&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of Fiscalism:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.investordictionary.com/definition/fiscalism&lt;/ref&gt;
- Contained fiscalism does not allow the economy to grow or decline as much as possible.
- Elevated fiscalism does not allow the economy to decline but, it does allow for the economy to grow unrestrained

== Roots ==
Fiscalism relies heavily on Keynesian theories which states that an active government intervention is necessary to ensure economic growth and stability.&lt;ref&gt;http://dirtyeconomics.com/fiscalism-will-pick-gauntlet/&lt;/ref&gt;

For fiscalists, employment is of primary concern. Y (income) is the independent variable in PY = MV (where P = price level, M = amount of money, V = velocity/turnover of money), changes in which affect effective demand. So fiscalists hold that Y needs to be controlled through fiscal policy, which affects effective demand. Effective demand draws forth investment to meet profit opportunity, and effective demand is income-dependent, since consumption cannot be funded by drawing down savings, selling assets, or financed by borrowing sustainably. If supply and demand are stabilized at optimal resource use, they unemployment is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;http://mikenormaneconomics.blogspot.cz/2011/08/monetarism-v-fiscalism.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiscalism and Modern Monetary Theory ==

The holy grail of macroeconomics is full employment along with price stability, which implies highly efficient use of resources while controlling price level.

In the first place, MMT rejects the monetarist explanation virtually in toto, claiming that it is based on an incorrect view of actual operations of the Treasury, central bank, and commercial banking, and how they interact. Secondly, MMT explains how to succeed in the quest for the holy grail through employment of the sectoral balance approach developed by Wynne Godley and functional finance developed by Abba Lerner. The thrust of this approach is to maintain effective demand sufficient for purchase of production (supply) at full employment by offsetting non-government saving desire with the currency issuer's fiscal balance. This stabilizes aggregate demand and aggregate supply at full employment (adjusting aggregate demand wrt changes in population and productivity) without risking inflation arising owing to excessive demand.

Note that this does not apply to price level rising due to supply shock, such as an oil crisis provoked by a cartel exerting a monopoly, or shortage of real resources., e.g. due to natural disaster, war, or climate. This is a separate issue and must be addressed differently according to MMT.

In a non-convertible floating rate monetary system, the currency issuer is not constrained operationally. The only constraint is real resources. If effective demand outruns the capacity of the economy to expand to meet it, then inflation will result. If effective demand falls short of the capacity of the economy to produce at full employment, then the economy will contract, an output gap open, and unemployment will rise.

This view is based on a Treasury-based monetary regime, in which money is created through currency issuance mediated by government fiscal expenditure. Issuance of Treasury securities to offset deficits functions as a reserve drain, which functions as a monetary operation that enables the central bank to hit its target rate rather than being a fiscal operation involving financing. Similarly, taxes are seen not as a funding operation for government expenditure, but as a means to withdraw non-government net financial assets created government expenditure, in order to control effective demand and thereby reduce inflationary pressure as needed iaw the sectoral balance approach and functional finance.

This view is quite the opposite of the credit-based monetary presumptions of monetarists, which MMT regards as appropriate to a convertible fixed rate regime like the gold standard but not to the current non-convertible floating rate system that began when President Nixon shut the gold window on August 15, 1971, and was later adopted by most nations, excepting those that pegged their currencies, ran currency boards, or gave up currency sovereignty as did members of the European Monetary Union in adopting the euro as a common currency.

It is important to note that MMT economists are NOT recommending the adoption of a Treasury-based monetary system. Rather, they are asserting that the present monetary system is already Treasury-based operationally, even when governments choose to impose political restraints that mimic obsolete practices and create the impression that these are operationally necessary.

MMT also recommends an employer assurance program (ELR, JG) to create a buffer stock of employed that the private sector can draw on as needed. This reduces idle resources and presents the possibility of achieving actual full employment (allowing 2% for transitional) along with price stability, which monetarism presumes inflationary. The ELR program also establishes a wage floor as price anchor for price stability.&lt;ref&gt;http://mikenormaneconomics.blogspot.cz/2011/08/monetarism-v-fiscalism.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:HarmonistChurchEconomyPA.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Harmony Society church in [[Old Economy Village|Old Economy Village, Pennsylvania]]]]

The '''Harmony Society''' was a [[Christian theosophy]] and [[Pietism|pietist]] society founded in [[Iptingen]], [[Germany]], in 1785. Due to religious persecution by the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]] and the government in [[Württemberg]], the group moved to the [[United States]],&lt;ref name="Sutton1"&gt;Robert Paul Sutton, ''Communal Utopias and the American Experience: Religious Communities'' (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2004) p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; where representatives initially purchased land in [[Butler County, Pennsylvania]]. On February 15, 1805, the group of approximately 400 followers formally organized the Harmony Society, placing all their goods in [[Commune (intentional community)|common]].

Under its founder and spiritual leader, [[George Rapp|Johann Georg Rapp]] (1757–1847); Frederick (Reichert) Rapp (1775–1834), his adopted son who managed its business affairs; and their associates, the Society existed for one hundred years, roughly from 1805 until 1905. Members were known as Harmonists, Harmonites, or Rappites. The Society is best known for its worldly successes, most notably the establishment of three model communities, the first at [[Harmony, Pennsylvania]]; the second, also called Harmony, in the [[Indiana Territory]], now [[New Harmony, Indiana]]; and the third and final town at [[Old Economy Village|Economy]], now [[Ambridge, Pennsylvania]].

[[Image:Johann Georg Rapp 1757 - 1847.jpg|thumb|Johann Georg Rapp ([[George Rapp]]) 1757–1847.]]

[[George Rapp|Johann Georg Rapp]] (1757 – 1847), also known as George Rapp, was the founder of the religious sect called Harmonists, Harmonites, Rappites, or the Harmony Society. Born in [[Iptingen]], Duchy of [[Württemberg]], [[Germany]], Rapp was a "bright but stubborn boy" who was also deeply religious. His "strong personality" and religious convictions began to concern local church authorities when he refused to attend church services or take communion.&lt;ref&gt;Karl J. R. Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society, 1785–1847'' (Philadelphia: [[University of Pennsylvania]] Press, 1965), p. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Rapp and his group of believers began meeting in Iptengen and eventually emigrated to the United States, where they established three communities: [[Harmony, Pennsylvania|Harmony]], [[Butler County, Pennsylvania|Butler County]], [[Pennsylvania]]; [[New Harmony, Indiana|Harmony (later named New Harmony)]], [[Posey County, Indiana|Posey County]], [[Indiana]]; and [[Old Economy Village|Economy]], [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania]].

Rapp became inspired by the philosophies of [[Jakob Böhme]], [[Philipp Jakob Spener]], [[Johann Heinrich Jung]], and [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], among others, and later wrote ''Thoughts on the Destiny of Man'', published in German in 1824 and in English a year later, in which he outlined his ideas and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;John Archibald Bole, ''The Harmony Society: A Chapter in German American Culture History'' (Philadelphia: Americana Germanica Press, 1904) p. 45, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Rapp lived out his remaining days in [[Old Economy Village|Economy]], where he died on August 7, 1847, at the age of 89.&lt;ref&gt;Karl J. R. Arndt, ''George Rapp's Successors and Material Heirs, 1847–1916'' (Rutherford, NJ: [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] Press, 1971), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1780s, Rapp had begun preaching to the Separatists, his followers in Iptengen, who met privately and refused to attend church services or take communion.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; As their numbers increased, Rapp's group officially split with the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]] in 1785 and was banned from meeting. Despite warnings from local authorities, the group continued to meet privately and attract even more followers.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1798 Rapp and his group of followers had already begun to distance themselves from mainstream society and intended to establish a new religious congregation of fellow believers. In the Lomersheimer declaration, written in 1798, these religious Separatists presented their statement of faith, based on Christian principles, to the Wurttemberg legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Rapp's followers declared their desire to form a separate congregation who would meet in members' homes, free from Lutheran Church doctrines. The group supported the belief that baptism was not necessary until children could decide for themselves whether they wanted to become a Christian. They also believed that confirmation for youth was not necessary and communion and confession would only be held a few times a year. Although the Separatists supported civil government, the group refused to make a physical oath in its support, "for according to the Gospel not oath is allowed him who gives evidence of a righteous life as an upright man."&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; They also refused to serve in the military or attend [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] schools, choosing instead to teach their children at home.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration of faith, along with some later additions, guided the Harmony Society's religious beliefs even after they had emigrated from Germany to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1790s, Rapp's followers continued to increase, reaching as many as 10,000 to 12, 000 members.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing numbers, which included followers outside of Rapp's village, continued to concern the government, who feared they might become rebellious and dangerous to the state.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no severe actions were initially taken to repress the Separatists, the group began to consider emigration to France or the United States. In 1803, when the government began to persecute Rapp's followers, he decided to move the entire group to the [[United States]]. Rapp and a small group of men left Iptingen in 1803 and traveled to America to find a new home.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 1804, the first group of emigrants departed for the United States. The initial move scattered the followers and reduced Rapp's original group of 12,000 to just a few followers. Johan Frederich Reichert, who later agreed to become Rapp's adopted son and took the name of Frederick Reichert Rapp, reported in a letter dated February 25, 1804, that there were "at least 100 families or 500 persons actually ready to go" even if they had to sacrifice their property.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlements in the United States==
In 1804, while Rapp and his associates remained in the United States looking for a place to settle, his followers sailed to America aboard several vessels and made their way to western [[Pennsylvania]], where they waited until land had been selected for their new settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 65–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Rapp was able to secure a large tract of land in [[Pennsylvania]] and started his first [[commune (intentional community)|commune]], known as Harmonie or [[Harmony, Pennsylvania|Harmony]], in [[Butler County, Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; where the Society existed from 1804 to 1815.&lt;ref name=beginnings189&gt;Karl J. R. Arndt, ''The Harmony Society from its beginnings in Germany in 1785 to its Liquidation in the United States in 1905'' (Philadelphia: [[American Philosophical Society]], 1953), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; It soon grew to a population of about 800, and was highly profitable. Ten years later, the town was sold and the Harmonists moved westward to the [[Indiana Territory]], where they established the town of Harmony, now called [[New Harmony, Indiana]], and remained there from 1815 to 1825.&lt;ref name=beginnings189/&gt; The Indiana settlement was sold to [[Robert Owen]] and was renamed [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]]. Ten years after the move to Indiana the commune moved again, this time returning to western [[Pennsylvania]], and named their third and final town [[Old Economy Village|Economy]] ('Ökonomie' in German).&lt;ref name=engineers&gt;{{cite web|author=David Schwab, comp.|title=The Harmony Society|publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers–Pittsburg District|date=2010-05-20|url=http://www.lrp.usace.army.mil/lmon/harmony.htm|accessdate=2012-06-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207155204/http://www.lrp.usace.army.mil/lmon/harmony.htm|archivedate=2012-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harmonists lived in Economy until the Society was dissolved in 1905.&lt;ref name=beginnings189/&gt;

===Articles of association===
On February 15, 1805, the settlers at Harmony, Pennsylvania, signed articles of association to formally establish the Harmony Society in the United States. In this document, Society members agreed to hold all property in a common fund, including working capital of $23,000 to purchase land, livestock, tools, and other goods needed to establish their town.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement gave the Society legal status in the United States and protected it from dissolution. Members contributed all of their possessions, pledged cooperation in promoting the interests of the group, and agreed to accept no pay for their services. In return, the members would receive care as long as they lived with the group. Under this agreement, if a member left the Society, their funds would be returned without interest or, if they had not contributed to the Society's treasury, they would receive a small monetary gift.&lt;ref name=Bole3334&gt;Bole, p. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society was a religious congregation who submitted to spiritual and material leadership under Rapp and his associates and worked together for the common good of all its members.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]] would occur during their lifetimes, the Harmonists contented to live simply under a strict religious doctrine, gave up tobacco, and advocated celibacy.&lt;ref name=engineers/&gt;

===First settlement: Harmony, Pennsylvania===
[[Image:HarmonyPAmuseum.jpg|thumb|Harmony Society building in [[Harmony, Pennsylvania]], built in 1809.]]
{{main|Harmony, Pennsylvania}}

In December 1804 Rapp and a party of two others initially contracted to purchase {{convert|4,500|acre|km2}} of land for $11,250 in [[Butler County, Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref&gt;William E. Wilson, ''The Angel and the Serpent: The Story of New Harmony'' (Bloomington: [[Indiana University Press]], 1964), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and later acquired additional land to increase their holdings to approximately {{convert|9,000|acre|km2}} by the time they advertised their property for sale in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 135, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Here they built the town of [[Harmony, Pennsylvania|Harmony]], a small community that had, in 1805, nearly 50 log houses, a large barn, a gristmill, and more than 150 acres of cleared land to grow crops.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the climate was not well suited for growing grapes and nearby property was not available to expand their landholdings, the Harmonists submitted a petition to the U.S. government for assistance in purchasing land elsewhere. In January 1806 Rapp traveled to Washington, D.C. to hear discussions in Congress regarding the Harmonists' petition for a grant that would allow them to purchase approximately {{convert|30,000|acre|km2}} acre of land in the Indiana Territory. While the Senate passed the petition on January 29, it was defeated in the House of Representatives on February 18. The Harmonists had to find other financial means to support their plans for future expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 84, 86–90.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1810 the town's population reached approximately 700, with about 130 houses. The Society landholdings also increased to {{convert|7,000|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Christiana F. Knoedler, ''The Harmony Society: A 19th-Century American Utopia'' (New York: Vantage Press, 1954), p. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, the Society survived disagreements among its members, while shortages of cash and lack of credit threatened its finances. Still, the young community had a good reputation for its industry and agricultural production.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Harmony, George Rapp, also known as Father Rapp, was recognized as the spiritual head of the Society, the one that they went to for discussions, confessions, and other matters.&lt;ref name=usi&gt;{{cite web|author= Historic New Harmony|title= The Harmonie Society|publisher= [[University of Southern Indiana]]|year= 2008|url= http://www.usi.edu/hnh/pdf/Expanded%20Text%20on%20the%20Harmonist%20Society.pdf|accessdate= 2012-06-13|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120330112904/http://www.usi.edu/hnh/pdf/Expanded%20Text%20on%20the%20Harmonist%20Society.pdf|archivedate= 2012-03-30|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapp's adopted son, Frederick, managed the Society's business and commercial affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapp let newcomers into the Society and, after a trial period, usually about a year, they were accepted as permanent members.&lt;ref name=Bole3334/&gt; While new members continued to arrive, including immigrants from Germany, others found the Harmonists' religious life too difficult and left the group.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, during a period of religious zeal in 1807 and 1808, most, but not all, of the Harmonists adopted the practice of [[celibacy]] and there were also few marriages among the members. Rapp's son, Johannes, was married in 1807; and it was the last marriage on record until 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 97–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rapp did not entirely bar sex initially, it gradually became a custom and there were few births in later years.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811 Harmony's population rose to around 800 persons involved in farming and various trades.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Although profit was not a primary goal, their finances improved and the enterprise was profitable, but not sufficient to carry out their planned expansions.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 123–127.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few years of their arrival, the Harmonist community included an inn, a tannery, warehouses, a brewery, several mills, stables, and barns, a church/meetinghouse, a school, additional dwellings for members, a labyrinth, and workshops for different trades. In addition, more land was cleared for vineyards and crops. The Harmonists also produced yarn and cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 105–107, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors led to the Harmonists' decision to leave Butler County. Because the area's climate was not suitable, they had difficulties growing grapes for wine.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as westward migration brought new settlers to the county, making it less isolated, the Harmonists began having troubles with neighbors who were not part of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1814 Butler County's growing population and rising land prices made it difficult for the Society to expand, causing the group's leaders to look for more land elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Once land had been located that offered a better climate and room to expand, the group began plans to move.&lt;ref&gt;Ray E. Boomhower, "New Harmony: Home to Indiana's Communal Societies," ''Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History'', 14(4):36.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814 the Harmonites sold their first settlement to Abraham Ziegler, a  [[Mennonite]], for $100,000 and moved west to make a new life for themselves in the [[Indiana Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second settlement: Harmony, Indiana===
[[Image:NewHarmonyIndiana.jpg|thumb|Harmony Society buildings in [[New Harmony, Indiana]].]]
{{Main|New Harmony, Indiana}}

In 1814 the Harmony Society moved to the [[Indiana Territory]], where it initially acquired approximately {{convert|3,500|acre|km2}} of land along the [[Wabash River]] in [[Posey County, Indiana|Posey County]] and later acquired more.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next ten years the Society built a thriving new community they called Harmonie or Harmony on the Wabash in the Indiana wilderness. (The town's name was changed to [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] after the Harmonists left in 1824.) The Harmonists entered into agriculture and manufacture on a larger scale than they had done in Pennsylvania. When the Harmonists advertised their [[Indiana]] property for sale in 1824, they had acquired {{convert|20,000|acre|km2}} of land, {{convert|2,000|acre|km2}} of which was under cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer and fall of 1814, many Harmonists fell sick from fever ([[malaria]]) and work on the new town nearly ceased.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the Society lost about 120 people and others fell ill until conditions were improved and the swamps around the area were drained.&lt;ref name=usi /&gt; Despite these illnesses, construction of the new town continued. By 1819 the Harmonites had built 150 log homes, a church, a community storehouse, barns, stables, and a tavern, along with thriving shops and mills, and cleared land for farming.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt; As the new settlement in Indiana grew, it also began to attract new arrivals, including emigrants from Germany, who expected the Harmonists to pay for their passage to America.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 182–198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Visitors to the new town commented on its growing commercial and industrial work. In 1819 the town had a steam-operated wool carding and spinning factory, a brewery, distillery, vineyards, and a winery,&lt;ref&gt;Karl J. R. Arndt, ''A Documentary History of the Indiana Decade of the Harmony Society 1814–1824'' (Indianapolis: [[Indiana Historical Society]], 1975), 1:744–745.&lt;/ref&gt; but not all visitors were impressed with the growing communist town on the frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''A Documentary History of the Indiana Decade of the Harmony Society'', 1:784.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society also had visitors from another communal religious society, the [[Shakers]]. In 1816 meetings between the Shakers and Harmonists considered a possible union of the two societies, but  religious differences between the two groups halted the union.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''A Documentary History of the Indiana Decade of the Harmony Society'', 1:225–229.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the groups remained, however, in contact over the years. George Rapp's daughter and others lived for a time at the Shaker settlement in [[West Union (Busro), Indiana|West Union, Indiana]], where the Shakers helped a number of Harmonites learn the [[English language]].&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''A Documentary History of the Indiana Decade of the Harmony Society'', 1:230.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harmonist community continued to thrive during the 1820s. The Society shipped its surplus agricultural produce and manufactured goods throughout the Ohio and Mississippi valleys or sold them through their stores at Harmony and Shawneetown and their agents in Pittsburgh, Saint Louis, Louisville, and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Bole, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Frederick Rapp's financial management the Society prospered, but he soon wished for a location better suited to manufacturing and commercial purposes.&lt;ref name=Bole91&gt;Bole, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; They had initially selected the land near the Wabash River for its isolation and opportunity for expansion, but the Harmonites were now a great distance from the eastern markets and trade in this location wasn't to their liking. They also had to deal with unfriendly neighbors.&lt;ref name=usi /&gt; As [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], the Harmonites faced disagreeable elements from slavery supporters in [[Kentucky]], only {{convert|15|mi|km}} away, which caused them much annoyance.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} By 1824 the decision had been made to sell their property in Indiana and search for land to the east.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 3, 1825, the Harmonists and [[Robert Owen]], a Welsh-born industrialist and social reformer, came to a final agreement for the sale of the Society's land and buildings in Indiana for $150,000. Owen named the town New Harmony, and by May, the last of the Harmony Society's remaining members returned to [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third settlement: Economy, Pennsylvania===
{{Main|Old Economy Village}}

[[Image:GrottoandHarmonyStatue.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Grotto (far left) and statue of [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] in the Harmony Society gardens in [[Old Economy Village|Old Economy Village, Pennsylvania]].]]

In 1824 Frederick Rapp initially purchased {{convert|1,000|acre|km2}} along the [[Ohio River]], {{convert|18|mi|km}} northwest of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], for $10,000, and later bought an additional {{convert|2,186| acre|km2}} for $33,445, giving the Society more than {{convert|3,000|acre|km2}} to develop into a new community.&lt;ref&gt;Knoedler, p. 19, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Harmonites named their third and last town [[Old Economy Village|Economy]], after the spiritual notion of the [[Divine Economy]], "a city in which God would dwell among men" and where perfection would be attained.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Economy the Harmonists intended to become more involved in manufacturing and their new town on the Ohio River provided better access to eastern markets and water access to the south and west than they had in Indiana.&lt;ref name=Bole91/&gt; By 1826 the Harmonists had woolen and cotton mills in operation as well as a steam-operated grain mill.&lt;ref&gt;Knoedler, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The Harmonist society also ran a wine press, a hotel, post office, saw mills, stores, and a variety of farms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead;cc=ascead;q1=John%20M.%20Tate;rgn=main;view=text;didno=US-PPiU-dar194602 John M. Tate, Jr. Collection of Notes, Pictures and Documents relating to the Harmony Society, 1806-1930, DAR.1946.02], Darlington Library, Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh&lt;/ref&gt; Here, under the business acumen and efficient management of Frederick Rapp, they enjoyed such prosperity that by 1829 they dominated trade and the markets of [[Pittsburgh]] and down the [[Ohio River]]. The Harmonists' competitors accused them of creating a [[monopoly]] and called on state government to dissolve the group.&lt;ref name=engineers/&gt; Despite the attacks, the Harmonists developed Economy into a prosperous factory town, engaged in farming on a large scale, and maintained a brewery, distillery, and wine-making operation.&lt;ref&gt;Bole, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; They also pioneered the manufacturing of silk in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''The Harmony Society from its beginnings in Germany in 1785 to its Liquidation in the United States in 1905'', p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The community was not neglectful of matters pertaining to art and culture. Frederick Rapp purchased artifacts and installed a museum containing fine paintings and many curiosities and antiques, but it proved to be unprofitable and was sold at a loss.&lt;ref name=Bole148&gt;Bole, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Harmonists maintained a [[Medieval deer park|deer park]], a floral park, and a maze, or labyrinth. The Harmonists were fond of music and many of the members were accomplished musicians. They sang, had a band/orchestra, composed songs, and gave much attention to its cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;Knoedler, p. 79–83.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1830 they had amassed a 360-volume library.&lt;ref name=Bole148/&gt;

In 1832 the Society suffered a serious division. Of 750 members, 250 became alienated through the influence of [[Bernhard Müller]] (self-styled Count de Leon), who, with 40 followers (also at variance with the authorities in [[Europe|the old country]]), had come to [[Old Economy Village|Economy]] to affiliate with the Society. Rapp and [[Bernhard Müller|Leon]] could not agree; a separation and apportionment of the property were therefore agreed upon. This secession of one-third of the Society, which consisted mostly of the flower of young manhood and young womanhood who did not want to maintain the custom of [[celibacy]], broke Frederick's heart. He died within two years. It resulted in a considerable fracturing of the community. Nevertheless, the Society remained prosperous in business investments for many more years to come.

After Frederick Rapp's death in 1834, George Rapp appointed Romelius Baker and Jacob Henrici as trustees to manage the Society's business affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel B. Reibel, ''A Guide to Old Economy'' (Old Economy, PA: Harmonie Associates, 1969), p. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; After George Rapp's death in 1847,  the Society reorganized. While a board of elders was elected for the enforcement of the Society's rules and regulations, business management passed to its trustees: Baker and Henrici, 1847–68; Henrici and Jonathan Lenz, 1869–90; Henrici and Wolfel, 1890; Henrici and John S. Duss, 1890–1892; Duss and Seiber, 1892–1893; Duss and Reithmuller, 1893–1897;Duss, 1897–1903; and finally to Suzanna (Susie) C. Duss in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Bole, p. 141–142, 229.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Successors and Material Heirs'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1905 membership had dwindled to just three members and the Society was dissolved.&lt;ref name=reibel9&gt;Reibel, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlements at Economy remained economically successful until the late 19th century, producing many goods in their cotton and woolen factories, sawmill, tannery, and from their vineyards and distillery.&lt;ref&gt;Bole, p. 97, 107, 113.&lt;/ref&gt; They also produced high quality [[silk]] for garments. Rapp's granddaughter, Gertrude, began the silk production in Economy on a small scale from 1826 to 1828, and later expanded.&lt;ref&gt;Knoedler, p. 58–60.&lt;/ref&gt; This was planned in New Harmony, but fulfilled when they arrived at Economy.&lt;ref name=usi/&gt; The Harmonists were industrious and utilized the latest technologies of the day in their factories. Because the group chose to adopt [[celibacy]] and their members grew older, more work gradually had to be hired out. As their membership declined, they stopped manufacturing operations, other than what they needed for themselves, and began to invest in other ventures such as the oil business, coal mining, timber, railroads, land development, and banking.&lt;ref name=reibel9/&gt; The group invested in the construction of the [[Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad]], established the Economy Savings Institution and the Economy Brick Works, and operated the Economy Oil Company,&lt;ref&gt;Bole, p. 133, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Economy Planing Mill, Economy Lumber Company, and eventually donated some land in [[Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania|Beaver Falls]] for the construction of [[Geneva College]]. The Society exerted a major influence on the economic development of [[Western Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Knoedler, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil production in the mid-1860s brought the high-water mark of the Society's prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Bole, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; By the close of Baker's administration in 1868, The Society's wealth was probably $2 million.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} By 1890, however, the Society was in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy with a depleted and aged membership. In addition, the Society faced litigation from previous members and would-be heirs. The Society's trustee, John S. Duss, settled the lawsuits, liquidated its business ventures, and paid the Society's indebtedness.&lt;ref name=reibel9/&gt; The great strain which he had undergone at this time undermined his health and he resigned his trusteeship in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Duss, ''The Harmonists: A Personal History'' (Harrisburg: Pennsylvania Book Service, 1943), p. 359–360.&lt;/ref&gt; With only a few members left, the remaining land and assets were sold under the leadership of Duss's wife, Susanna (Susie), and the Society was formally dissolved in 1905.&lt;ref name=reibel9/&gt; At the time of the Society's dissolution, its net worth was $1.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Successors and Material Heirs'', p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 the [[Pennsylvania|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] acquired {{convert|6|acre|km2}} and 17 buildings of Economy, which became the [[Old Economy Village]] historic site. The [[American Bridge Company]] had already acquired other parts of the Society's land in 1902 to build the town of [[Ambridge, Pennsylvania|Ambridge]].&lt;ref name=reibel9/&gt;

In 1791 [[George Rapp]] said, "I am a [[prophet]], and I am called to be one" in front of the civil affairs official in [[Maulbronn]], [[Germany]], who promptly had him imprisoned for two days and threatened with [[exile]] if he did not cease preaching.&lt;ref name="Arndt1"&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society, 1785–1847'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pitzer1"&gt;Donald E. Pitzer, ''America's Communal Utopias'' (Chapel Hill: [[University of North Carolina]], 1997) p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; To the great consternation of church and state authorities, this mere peasant from [[Iptingen]] had become the outspoken leader of several thousand [[Separatism|Separatists]] in the southern German duchy of [[Württemberg]].&lt;ref name="Sutton1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arndt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pitzer1"/&gt; By 1802 the Separatists had grown in number to about 12,000 and the Württemberg government decided that they were a dangerous threat to social order.&lt;ref name="Sutton1"/&gt; Rapp was summoned to Maulbronn for an interrogation, and the government confiscated Separatist books.&lt;ref name="Sutton1"/&gt; When released in 1803, from a brief time in prison, Rapp told his followers to pool their assets and follow him on a journey for safety to the "land of Israel" in the [[United States]], and soon over 800 people were living with him there.&lt;ref name="Sutton1"/&gt;

The Harmonites were [[Christian]] [[Pietism|pietist]] [[Separatism|Separatists]] who split from the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]] in the late 18th century. Under the leadership of [[George Rapp]], the group left [[Württemberg]], [[Germany]], and came to the [[United States]] in 1803. Due to the troubles they had in Europe, the group sought to establish a more perfect society in the American wilderness. They were [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] [[Pacifism|pacifists]] who refused to serve in the military and tried to live by George Rapp's philosophy and literal interpretations of the [[New Testament]]. They first settled and built the town of [[Harmony, Pennsylvania]], in 1804, and established the Harmony Society in 1805 as a religious [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]]. In 1807, [[celibacy]] was advocated as the preferred custom of the community in an attempt to purify themselves for the coming [[Millennialism|Millennium]]. Rapp believed that the events and wars going on in the world at the time were a confirmation of his views regarding the imminent [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]], and he also viewed [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] as the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref name="Baumgartner"&gt;Frederic J. Baumgartner, ''Longing for the End: A History of Millennialism in Western Civilization'' (1999) p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814, the Society sold their first town in Pennsylvania and moved to the [[Indiana Territory]], where they built their second town. In 1824, they decided it was time to leave Indiana, sold their land and town in Indiana, and moved to their final settlement in [[Western Pennsylvania]].

The Harmonites were [[Millennialism|Millennialists]], in that they believed [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] was coming to earth in their lifetime to help usher in a thousand-year kingdom of peace on earth. This is perhaps why they believed that people should try to make themselves "pure" and "perfect", and share things with others while willingly living in [[Commune (intentional community)|communal]] "harmony" ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] [[Christian communism#Biblical citations|4:32-35]]) and practicing [[celibacy]]. They believed that the old ways of life on earth were coming to an end, and that a new perfect kingdom on earth was about to be realized.

They also practiced forms of [[Esoteric Christianity]], [[Mysticism]] ([[Christian mysticism]]), and Rapp often spoke of the [[Virginity|virgin]] [[spirit]] or [[Goddess#Christianity|Goddess]] named [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]] in his writings.&lt;ref name="Versluis"&gt;Arthur Versluis, "Western Esotericism and The Harmony Society", ''Esoterica I'' (1999) p. 20–47. [http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/Versluis.html Michigan State University]&lt;/ref&gt; Rapp was very influenced by the writings of [[Jakob Böhme]],&lt;ref name ="Versluis"/&gt; [[Philipp Jakob Spener]], and [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], among others. Also, at [[Ambridge, Pennsylvania|Economy]], there are glass bottles and literature that seem to indicate that the group was interested in (and practiced) [[alchemy]].&lt;ref name ="Versluis"/&gt; Other books found in the Harmony Society's library in Economy, include those by the following authors: [[Christoph Schütz]], [[Gottfried Arnold]], [[Justinus Kerner]], [[Thomas Bromley (1629–1691)|Thomas Bromley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = PasstheWORD | title = Thomas Bromley On-Line Manuscripts | publisher = PasstheWORD  | date = 2005-10-13 | url =http://www.passtheword.org/Thomas-Bromley/ | accessdate = 2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jane Leade]], [[Johann Scheible]] (''[[Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | author = Joseph H. Peterson | title = The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses
 | publisher = Esotericarchives.com | year = 2005 | url = http://www.esotericarchives.com/moses/67moses.htm | accessdate = 2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paracelsus]], and [[Georg von Welling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Georg von Welling |title=''Opus Mago-Cabalisticum''  |publisher=Frankfurt and Leipzig: The Fleischer Bookstore |date=1784, third ed., edited and translated by Arthur Versluis |url=http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/Archive/Welling.html |accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.&lt;ref name ="Versluis"/&gt;

The Harmonites tended to view [[Single person|unmarried]] [[celibacy|celibate]] life as morally superior to [[marriage]], based on Rapp's belief that [[God]] had originally created [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] as a dual being, having male and female sexual organs.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Successors and Material Heirs'', p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, when the female portion of Adam separated to form [[Eve]], disharmony followed, but one could attempt to regain harmony through celibacy.

[[George Rapp]] predicted that on September 15, 1829, the three and one half years of the [[Woman of the Apocalypse|Sun Woman]] would end and [[Christ]] would begin his reign on earth.&lt;ref name="Baumgartner"/&gt; Dissension grew when Rapp's predictions did not come to pass. In March 1832, one third of the group left the Society and some began following [[Bernhard Müller]], who claimed to be the [[Lion of Judah#Lion of Judah in Christianity|Lion of Judah]]. Nevertheless, most of the group stayed and Rapp continued to lead them until he died on August 7, 1847. His last words to his followers were, "If I did not so fully believe, that the Lord has designated me to place our society before His presence in the land of Canaan, I would consider this my last".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harmonites did not mark their [[Grave (burial)|graves]] with [[headstone]]s or grave markers, because they thought it was unnecessary to do so; however, one exception is George Rapp's son Johannes' stone marker in Harmony, Pennsylvania, which was installed by non-Harmonites many years after the Harmonites left that town.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Successors and Material Heirs'', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Harmonist [[graveyard]]s are fenced in grassy areas with signs posted nearby explaining this practice.

=== Architecture ===

The Harmony Society's architecture reflected their [[Swabia]]n [[Germans|German]] traditions, as well as the styles that were being developed in America during the 19th century. In the early days of the Society, many of the homes were initially log cabins and later, Harmonist craftsmen built timber-frame homes. At Economy, their homes were mostly two-story brick houses "that showed the influence of their American neighbors."&lt;ref&gt;Don Blair, "Harmonist Construction. Principally as found in the two-story houses built in Harmonie, Indiana, 1814–1824," ''[[Indiana Historical Society]] Publications'' 23, no. (1964): 81.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Harmonist buildings, in addition to being sturdy and functional, were centrally heated, economical to maintain, and resistant to fire, weather, and termites.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once established at Harmony, Pennsylvania, the Society planned to replace the log dwellings with brick structures, but the group moved to the Indiana Territory before the plan was completed.&lt;ref name="Arndt, p. 109"&gt;Arndt, ''George Rapp's Harmony Society'', p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In Indiana, log homes were soon replaced with one- or two-story houses of timber frame or brick construction in addition to four large rooming houses (dormitories) for its growing membership. The new town also included shops, schools, mills, a granary, a hotel, library, distilleries, breweries, a brick kiln, pottery ovens, barn, stables, storehouses, and two churches, one of which was brick.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1822 William Herbert, a visitor to Harmony, Indiana, described the new brick church and the Harmonists' craftsmanship:

"These people exhibit considerable taste as well as boldness of design in some of their works. They are erecting a noble church, the roof of which is supported in
the interior by a great number of stately columns, which have been turned from
trees in their own forests. The kinds of wood made use of for this purpose are, I
am informed, black walnut, cherry and sassafras. Nothing I think can exceed the
grandeur of the joinery and the masonry and brickwork seem to be of the first
order. The form of this church is that of a cross, the limbs being short and equal;
and as the doors, which there are four, are placed at the end of the limbs, the
interior of the building as seen from the entrance, has a most ample and spacious effect.... I could scarcely imagine myself to be in the woods of Indiana, on the borders of the Wabash, while pacing the long resounding aisles, and surveying the stately colonnades of this church."&lt;ref name=usi/&gt;

Frame structures were built on piers to keep the air circulating across the area's damp soil, while brick structures had a root cellar with a drainage tunnel. Inside, Harmonists built fireplaces to the left or right of center to allow for a long center beam, adding strength to support the structure and its heavy, shingled roof. "Dutch biscuits" (wood laths wrapped in straw and mud) provided insulation and soundproofing between the ceiling and floors. The exterior was insulated with bricks between the exterior's unpainted weatherboards and the interior's lath and plaster walls.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 52–54, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Structures had standard parts and pre-cut, pre-measured timbers, which were assembled on the ground, adjusted to fit on site, raised in place, and locked into place with pegs and mortise and tenon joints.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Two-story floor plans for homes included a large living room, kitchen, and entrance hall, with stairs to the second floor and attic. In Indiana, Harmonists did their baking in communal ovens, so stoves could be substituted for fireplaces.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 66, 71, 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Living styles ===

At Harmony, Pennsylvania, four to six members were assigned to a home, where they lived as families, although not all those living in the household were related.&lt;ref name="Arndt, p. 109"/&gt; Even when the house contained those that were married, they would live together as brother and sister, since there was a suggestion and custom of practicing [[celibacy]].  In Indiana, Harmonists continued to live in homes, but they also built dormitories to house single men and women.&lt;ref name=usi/&gt;

Society members woke between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. They ate breakfast between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m., lunch at 9 a.m., dinner at noon, afternoon lunch at 3 p.m., and supper between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;Bole, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; They did their chores and work during the day. At the end of the day, members met for meetings and had a curfew of 9 p.m. On Sundays, the members respected the "Holy day" and did no unnecessary work, but attended church services, singing groups, and other social activities.&lt;ref name=usi/&gt;

=== Clothing ===

Their style of dress reflected their [[Swabia]]n [[Germans|German]] roots and traditions and was adapted to their life in America.&lt;ref name=Bole146&gt;Bole, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Harmonites typically wore [[plain dress|plain clothing]], made with their own materials by their own tailors, they would wear their fine garments on Sundays and on other special occasions. At Economy, on special occasions and Sundays, women wore silk dresses using fabric of their own manufacture.&lt;ref name=Bole146/&gt; Clothing varied in color, but often carried the same design. On a typical day, women wore ankle-length dresses, while men wore pants with vests or coats and a hat.&lt;ref name=usi/&gt;

=== Technology ===

The Harmonites were a prosperous agricultural and industrial people. They had many machines that helped them be successful in their trades. They even had steam-powered engines that ran the machines at some of their factories in [[Old Economy Village|Economy]]. They kept their machines up to date, and had many factories and mills.

=== Work ===

Each member of the Society had a job in a certain craft or trade. Most of the work done by men consisted of manual labor, while the women dealt more with textiles or agriculture.

As Economy became more technologically developed, Harmonites began to hire others from outside the Society, especially when their numbers decreased because of the custom of celibacy and as they eventually let fewer new members join. Although the Harmonites did seek work-oriented help from the outside, they were known as a community that supported themselves, kept their ways of living in their community, mainly exported goods, and tried to import as little as possible.

== Rise and fall of Harmony Society ==

[[George Rapp]] had an [[Eloquence|eloquent]] style, which matched his commanding presence, and he was the personality that led the group through all the different settlements. After Rapp's death in 1847, a number of members left the group because of disappointment and disillusionment over the fact that his prophecies regarding the return of Jesus Christ in his lifetime were not fulfilled. However, many stayed in the group, and the Harmony Society went on to become an even more profitable business community that had many worldly financial successes under the leadership of Romelius L. Baker and Jacob Henrici.

Over time the group became more protective of itself, did not allow many new members, moved further from its religious foundation to a more business-oriented and pragmatic approach, and the custom of [[celibacy]] eventually drained it of its membership. The land and financial assets of the Harmony Society were sold off by the few remaining members under the leadership of John Duss and his wife, Susanna, by the year 1906.

Today, many of the Society's remaining buildings are preserved; all three of their settlements in the United States have been declared [[National Historic Landmark|National Historic Landmark Districts]] by the [[National Park Service]].

The '''International Authority for the Ruhr''' ('''IAR''') was an international body established in 1949 by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] to control the coal and steel industry of the [[Ruhr Area]] in [[West Germany]]. Its seat had been in [[Düsseldorf]].

It was agreed at meetings in [[London]] on 20 April and 2 June 1949 by the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[French Fourth Republic|France]] and the [[Benelux]] countries. The London agreement was signed on 28 April of that year. It was abolished by the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1951, which moved its activities to the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC). The IAR ended its work on 27 May 1952.

==Background==
[[Image:French Proposal 11 March 1946.jpg|thumb|350px|Map showing details of the 1946 French proposal for the detachment of the Ruhr area and parts of the [[Rhineland]] from Germany.]]
The early French plans were concerned with keeping Germany weak and strengthening the French economy at the expense of that of Germany (see the [[Monnet Plan]]). French foreign policy aimed at dismantling German heavy industry, placing the coal-rich [[Ruhr area]] and [[Rhineland]] under French control or at a minimum internationalize them, and also joining the coal-rich [[Saarland]] with the iron-rich province of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] (which had been handed over from Germany to France again in 1944).&lt;ref name="collectionscanada.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp03/MQ54257.pdf|title=www.collectionscanada.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp03/MQ54257.pdf&lt;!--INSERT TITLE--&gt;|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; When American diplomats reminded the French of what a devastating effect this would have on the German economy, France's response was to suggest the Germans would just have to "make the necessary adjustments" to deal with the inevitable foreign exchange deficit.&lt;ref name="collectionscanada.ca"/&gt;

In 1947 France removed the Saar from Germany and turned it into a [[Saar (protectorate)|protectorate]] under French economic control. The area returned to German administration on 1 January 1957 but France retained the right to mine from its coal mines until 1981. French plans for the complete detachment of the Ruhr from Germany met with greater resistance. In September 1946 [[James F. Byrnes]],  the [[United States Secretary of State]] stated in a Stuttgart speech [[Restatement of Policy on Germany]] that the United States would accept the French claims on the Saarland, but that: "the United States will not support any encroachment on territory which is indisputably German or any division of Germany which is not genuinely desired by the people concerned. So far as the United States is aware the people of the Ruhr area and the Rhineland desire to remain united with the rest of Germany. And the United States is not going to oppose their desire."

==Overview==
The Ruhr Agreement was imposed on the (West) Germans as a condition for permitting them to establish the [[Federal Republic of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Amos Yoder, "[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1404797 The Ruhr Authority and the German Problem]", ''The Review of Politics'', Vol. 17, No. 3 (Jul., 1955), pp. 345-358&lt;/ref&gt; By controlling the production and distribution of coal and steel (i.e. how much coal and steel the Germans themselves would get), the International Authority for the Ruhr in effect controlled the entire West German economy, much to the dismay of the Germans. They were however permitted to send their delegations to the authority after the [[Petersberg agreement]].

With the West German agreement to join the European Coal and Steel Community in order to lift the restrictions imposed by the IAR,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geschichte.nrw.de/artikel.php?artikel%5Bid%5D=50&amp;lkz=en|title=No more guns from the Ruhr!}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus also ensuring French security by perpetuating French access to Ruhr coal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.cgi?path=18409996001629 France Restored: Cold War Diplomacy and the Quest for Leadership in Europe, 1944-1954] H-Net Reviews June 2001&lt;/ref&gt; the role of the IAR was taken over by the ECSC.&lt;ref&gt;Information bulletin Frankfurt, Germany: Office of the US High Commissioner for Germany Office of Public Affairs, Public Relations Division, APO 757, US Army, January 1952 "Plans for terminating international authority for the Ruhr" , pp. 61-62] ([http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/History.omg1952Jan main URL])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Council==
The authority was governed by a council composed of the signatory governments of the [[London Agreement of 1949|London Agreement]]. The representatives of the Allies each had three votes and the Benelux countries had one vote each. The agreement also stipulated the accession of [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Occupied Germany]] as soon as it had formed a government recognized by the Allies, and that role came to be held by West Germany. Economic costs were shared among the members on the basis of voting rights.
*[[Belgium]], 1 vote
*[[France]], 3 votes
*[[Luxembourg]], 1 vote
*[[Netherlands]], 1 vote
*[[United Kingdom]], 3 votes
*[[United States]], 3 votes
*[[West Germany]], 3 votes

The '''Italian Animal Welfare Party''' (''Partito Animalista Italiano'') is a minor [[animal rights]] and [[animal welfare]] [[list of political parties in Italy|political party]] in Italy. It was founded on 4 July 2006  and is led by [[Cristiano Ceriello]].

==Information==
The Italian Animal Party was created with aspiration to defend the rights of animals and in order to work in the Institutions and Parliaments so that the people and members would be able to build a new society that can gain more respect for Animalism and to create more awareness for animals and fauna in general. The program as a whole for the Italian Animal Welfare Party is centered on the idea of animal rights. The goal of this organization is to work together with the local authorities of the State by committing to founding and creating local organizations that will join in the effort to help to create a better relationship with animals. This organization works to enforce their statutes with a commitment that they have to the animals.&lt;ref name="Animalista Italiano"&gt;{{cite web|title=P. A. I. :  Italian Animalist Party|url=http://www.partitoanimalista.it/INDEX_English.htm|publisher=Animalista Italiano|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not represented in the [[Italian Parliament]], the [[European Parliament]], nor in any regional or provincial assemblies.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Activism==
The industry of bullfighting in Spain, which is over 300 years old and a great part of the traditional Spaniard culture, is going into a recession due to the activism that has been brought on by animal-rights activists. The animal-rights activism against bullfighting was led by Partido Animalista. Silvia Barquero, a party spokeswoman of the Animal Welfare Party, said that the ban in Catalonia was in part a result of an Animalista campaign targeting Spain's northern regions, where bullfighting was never as popular as in the south.&lt;ref name=WallStreetJournal&gt;{{cite web|title=Bullfighting in Spain Is Stumbling|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324766604578459073959438626|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jaqueline Gomes de Jesus''' (born March 7, 1978) is a Brazilian psychologist, writer, and activist. Jesus is the daughter of a computer operator and a mining science teacher. She has a sibling, a younger brother. Jesus lived most of her life in [[Ceilândia]]. A good student, she studied chemistry, for a year before switching majors. She holds an M.Sc. in Psychology from the [[University of Brasília]], and a PhD in Social Psychology, Work and Organisations from the same institution. She worked at the University of Brasília from 2003-2008 as a diversity adviser and also coordinated a center for black students. She was one of the organizers of Brasilia's [[Pride parade]], and participated in the development of Brazil's goals for the UN's Millennium Dome. Jesus has proactively addressed discriminatory actions, refusing to accept passive prejudice. She began her human rights activism in 1997, with "Estructuración", a Brasilia homosexual group, serving first as secretary and in 1999, became president. In that period, she worked alongside government and educational institutions, in fighting prejudice and valuing differences, speaking at the opening of the 5th National Conference on Human Rights. Jesus participated in various social movements. In 2000, with [[Luiz Mott]], she cofounded the Academic Association of Gays, Lesbians and Sympathizers of Brazil, serving as general secretary. She was appointed to the editorial board of the Grupo Gay Negro de Bahia; and founded the NGO Acciones Ciudades en Orientación sexual.&lt;ref name=correiobraziliense.com2009&gt;{{cite news|title=Primeira transexual brasiliense a chegar a um doutorado na UnB fala sobre preconceito|url=http://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/app/noticia/cidades/2009/11/08/interna_cidadesdf,153389/index.shtml|accessdate=8 March 2015|publisher=Correio Braziliense|date=8 November 2009|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1871">'''Libertarian League''' was a name used by two [[Anarchism in the United States|American anarchist]] and [[libertarian socialist]] organisations during the twentieth century.

The first Libertarian League was founded in [[Los Angeles]] between the two World Wars.&lt;ref name="anarchistvoices"&gt;[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]] (2005).  ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''.  AK Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|486}}  It was established mainly by Cassius V. Cook, Charles T. Sprading, [[Clarence Lee Swartz]], [[Henry Cohen (anarchist)|Henry Cohen]], Hans F. Rossner and Thomas Bell.&lt;ref name="anarchistvoices"/&gt;{{rp|486}}

The second Libertarian League was founded in [[New York City]] in 1954 as a political organisation building on the [[Libertarian Book Club]].&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Bill (19 Jan 2012).  "[http://thevillager.com/2012/01/19/the-left-libertarians-the-last-of-an-ancient-breed/ The Left-Libertarians — the last of an ancient breed]".  ''The Villager''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anarchistvoices"/&gt;{{rp|471–472}}  Members included [[Sam Dolgoff]], [[Russell Blackwell]], [[Dave Van Ronk]], [[Enrico Arrigoni]]&lt;ref name="anarchistvoices"/&gt; and [[Murray Bookchin]].  This league had a narrower political focus than the first, promoting [[anarchism]] and [[syndicalism]].  Its central principle, stated in its journal ''[[Views and Comments]]'', was "equal freedom for all in a free socialist society".  Branches of the League opened in a number of other American cities, including [[Detroit]] and [[San Francisco]].  It was dissolved at the end of the 1960s.

'''''Lobster''''' is a magazine that is interested primarily in the influence of [[Intelligence analysis|intelligence]] and [[security agency|security services]] on politics and [[International trade|world trade]], what it calls "[[deep politics]]" or "parapolitics". It combines the examination of [[conspiracy theories]] and contemporary history.&lt;ref&gt;Kenn Thomas, ''Cyberculture Counterconspiracy'', publisher Book Tree, 1999, {{ISBN|1585091251}}, 9781585091256, 180 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=A-RJFs5Nq5sC&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;ots=A7qVtAVNUb&amp;dq=lobster%20parapolitics%20conspiracy&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=lobster%20parapolitics%20conspiracy&amp;f=false page 71]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lobster'' Issue No.1, September 1983,  {{ISSN|0964-0436}}, which states that it is "a journal/newsletter about intelligence, parapolitics, state structures and so forth"&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lobster'' is edited and published in the United Kingdom and has appeared twice a year for {{age|1983|9|1}} years, at first in 16-page A5 format, then as an A4 magazine. Operating on a shoestring, its contributors include academics and others. Since 2009 it is distributed as a free downloadable PDF document.&lt;ref name="website"/&gt;

According to the ''[[Hull Daily Mail]]'', ''Lobster'' 'investigates government conspiracies, state espionage and the secret service.' &lt;ref&gt;"Sexed-up files, lies and surveillance tapes....

==History==
[[File:robin-ramsay-lobster.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Lobster'' co-founder and editor, [[Robin Ramsay (editor)|Robin Ramsay]], 2007]]

===Founding===
In 1982, an American newsletter about the Kennedy assassination, ''Echoes of Conspiracy'',&lt;ref&gt;See "[http://www.baylor.edu/lib/poage/jfk/index.php?id=57261 JFK Newsletters]", in the Baylor Collections of Political Materials at Baylor University, retrieved 17 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; put Robin Ramsay and Stephen Dorril in touch with each other because of their common interest in the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|JFK assassination story]]. A few months later, they decided to launch a magazine, and in September 1983, they published 150 copies of ''The Lobster'' priced at 50p.&lt;ref name="mccrum1991"&gt;Robert McCrum, "Inside Story: In the lair of the lobster - Stephen Dorril and Robin Ramsey edit a left-wing journal that offers succour to conspiracy theorists and keeps the professionals on their toes", ''The Guardian'' (London), 31 August 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Ramsay later described himself and his associate: "Dorril is a Freudo-anarchist, with Situationist tendencies; and Ramsay is a premature anti-Militant member of the soft old left of the Labour Party".&lt;ref&gt;"A review of the (bad) reviews of Smear! Wilson and the Secret State", ''Lobster'' Issue 22, November 1991, {{ISSN|0964-0436}}, Hull, United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural issue stated its aims as "a journal/newsletter about intelligence, parapolitics, state structures and so forth [..] there is no copyright on the material in The Lobster [..] we hope to break even at the present price of 50p, but we may not [..] should appear 6 times a year".&lt;ref&gt;Steve Dorril and Robin Ramsay (editors), ''Lobster'' Issue 1, September 1983,  {{ISSN|0964-0436}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Issue 5 onwards, the cover dropped the [[The#Definite article|definite article]] and became just "Lobster".&lt;ref&gt;Cover, ''Lobster'' Issue 5, August 1984, {{ISSN|0964-0436}} (see "[http://www.lobster-magazine.co.uk/issue01.php Lobster Issues 1-8: 1983-1985]")&lt;/ref&gt;

Publishing frequency ''Lobster'' dropped to four issues in 1984 and three issues in 1986 and 1987, before settling down as a bi-annual from 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lobster-magazine.co.uk/ Lobster Issues website], retrieved 15 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lobster'' logo (see illustration), first appeared in issue 20 in November 1990 and was designed by Clive Gringras.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Ramsay, "A review of the (bad) reviews of Smear! Wilson and the Secret State" ''Lobster'' Issue 20, November 1990,  {{ISSN|0964-0436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Format and costs===
[[File:lobster-magazine-logo.svg|thumb|left|150px |''Lobster'''s logo, designed by Clive Gringras]]
The first 8 issues of ''Lobster'' are [[ISO 216|A5 paper size]] (148 × 210mm) format, growing to A4 (210 × 297mm) from Issue 9 in September 1985.&lt;ref&gt;"Editorially", ''Lobster'' Issue 8, June 1985,  {{ISSN|0964-0436}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was originally typewritten, reduced on a photocopier, pasted-up and printed on a [[Gestetner]] off-set litho duplicating machine. Around issue 17, the magazine was type-set on an Amstrad PCW using [[Wordstream]] and from ''Lobster'' 27, on an AppleMac with Claris Works.&lt;ref name="ramsayhistory"&gt;Robin Ramsay, "A short history of Lobster", and "Lobster Credits", and "About the CD-Rom", ''Lobster'' online, retrieved 15 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lobster'' Issue 57 (Summer 2009) was the last hard copy issue.&lt;ref name="beast2009"&gt;The Feral Beast, "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/the-feral-beast-shoots-eats-and-leaves-1839161.html 'Lobster' served online]", ''The Independent on Sunday'', 13 December 2009, First Edition, page 88&lt;/ref&gt; Issue 58 (Winter 2009/2010) was the first available without charge. The magazine is published from Ramsay's home in Hull.&lt;ref&gt;"Shock Lobster", ''Sunday Herald'', 17 August 2003. [http://archives.econ.utah.edu/archives/a-list/2003w33/msg00042.html Online at U. Utah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227034314/http://archives.econ.utah.edu/archives/a-list/2003w33/msg00042.html |date=27 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lobster'' is published not-for-profit. The ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'' quoted Ramsay that the magazine ".. always broke even, as I would put the price up if it started losing money. The readers paid whatever I asked", which the newspaper commented "Sounds a fine business model".&lt;ref name="beast2009"/&gt; [[Robert McCrum]] in ''The Guardian'' quotes Ramsay as boasting that ''Lobster'' is "the only left-wing journal to pay for itself".&lt;ref name="mccrum1991"/&gt;

===The Dorril/Ramsay split===
In March 1993, ''The Independent'' newspaper noted that the founders of ''Lobster'' had fallen out, and that "The break between the two men began in December when Ramsay told Dorril he was removing his name from the ''Lobster'' masthead and would run the twice-yearly magazine alone." &lt;ref name="moonlight1993" /&gt; The London [[Evening Standard]] reported that Ramsay had told his readers that Dorril also planned to produce a magazine called ''Lobster''.&lt;ref&gt;"Lobster Plot", ''Evening Standard'' (London), 24 June 1993, Thursday, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; After producing ''Lobster'' Issue 25, they each produced their own version of ''Lobster'' Issue 26. Dorril recalls a different version of events.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Dorril (Editor and publisher), ''Lobster'' 26 ('93), Holmfirth, West Yorkshire ([http://www.8bitmode.com/rogerdog/lobster/lobster26.pdf online])&lt;/ref&gt; Dorril's website indicates that his ''Lobster'' Issue 31 (October 1996) was the last published.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.8bitmode.com/rogerdog/news.htm News]" at Rogerdog.co.uk, The Home Page of author Stephen Dorril, retrieved 15 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative media expert&lt;ref&gt;Kate Smith, "[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jul/15/highereducation.students Pelted with cyber-tomatoes]", ''The Guardian'', Tuesday 15 July 2008, retrieved 27 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and  Professor of Media and Culture at Edinburgh Napier University, [[Chris Atton]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napier.ac.uk/sci/staff/pages/chrisatton.aspx Staff profile - Chris Atton], Edinburgh Napier University, retrieved 27 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Dorril's ''Lobster'' concentrates on the activities of the British and US [[security agency|security services]], while Robin Ramsay's ''Lobster'' casts its net wider to encompass histories of [[fascism]], the [[JFK assassination theories|JFK assassination]], the [[Pan Am Flight 103|Lockerbie bombing]] and the [[Unethical human experimentation in the United States|military's medical experiments]] on service personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Atton, "Parapolitics and Deep Politics" in ''Alternative literature: a practical guide for librarians'', publisher: Gower, 1996, {{ISBN|0566076659}}, 9780566076657, 202 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zeXgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=lobster#search_anchor page 81]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name===
The name of the magazine, "Lobster", has attracted multiple interpretations. Dorril recalls that "We wanted the magazine to sound not pompous, and as a teenager, he would invent names for punk rock groups. 'Lobster' was just one of his favourites."&lt;ref name="mccrum1991"/&gt; Ramsay recalls that "The name "Lobster" was Steve Dorril's choice. I couldn't think of an alternative and I didn't think the name mattered. As far as I know it had no connotations for Dorril; indeed as I remembered it, the absence of connotations was part of is appeal."&lt;ref name="ramsayhistory"/&gt;

==Controversy==

===Operation Clockwork Orange, Colin Wallace and Fred Holroyd===
[[File:Lord Harold Wilson Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Revealed by ''Lobster'': a plot to destabilise the government of UK Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]]]]

[[File:Margaret Thatcher (Retouched).JPG|thumb|right|150px|Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher would not refer ''Lobster'''s allegations to the [[Security Commission]] ]]

''Lobster'' published the first account of the [[Colin Wallace]] affair,&lt;ref&gt;Ian McIntyre, "Book Review, Caught in a Lobster pot; 'Smear!' - Stephen Dorril and Robin Ramsay: 4th Estate, 20 pounds", ''The Independent'' (London), 9 September 1991, Monday, Editorial p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Stephenson, "THE year is 1989. The place is London. A wealthy American begins hearing voices in his head. All day, every day he hears them. He comes to believe that the voices are being beamed into his brain by the CIA or some other secret organisation.", ''Hull Daily Mail'', 26 June 2000, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; also known as [[Clockwork Orange (plot)|Operation Clockwork Orange]], about the plot by disaffected members of Britain's Security Service, [[MI5]], to destabilise the [[Harold Wilson#First term as Prime Minister (1964–70)|Harold Wilson Labour Government]],&lt;ref&gt;Richard Keeble, ''Communication Ethics Today'', Publisher Troubador Publishing Ltd, 2006, {{ISBN|1905237685}}, 9781905237685, p. 284, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9LLnFThmdJEC&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;ots=0KVC5QNc1b&amp;dq=%22%20Clockwork%20Orange%22%20wallace%20lobster&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20Clockwork%20Orange%22%20wallace%20lobster&amp;f=false page 20]&lt;/ref&gt; and to smear politicians such as former [[Tory]] prime minister [[Edward Heath]].&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Klug, Keir Starmer, Stuart Weir, ''The Three Pillars of Liberty: Securing Political Rights and Freedom in the United Kingdom'', publisher: Routledge, 1996, {{ISBN|0415096413}}, 9780415096416, p. 377, [https://books.google.com/books?id=w513l1WunlYC&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=operation%20%22Clockwork%20Orange%22%20%20Edward%20Heath&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q=operation%20%22Clockwork%20Orange%22%20%20Edward%20Heath&amp;f=false page 153]&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of ''Lobster'' described the revelations as Britain's [[Watergate]] and the biggest story since World War Two. The relevations were subsequently confirmed by former MI5 officer [[Peter Wright]] in his book ''[[Spycatcher]]''.&lt;ref name="mccrum1991"/&gt;

====Political fallout====
In late 1986, questions were asked in the UK Parliament concerning the matters in ''Lobster''. Then [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] Member of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] for [[Kingston upon Hull North (UK Parliament constituency)|Hull North]], [[Kevin McNamara (politician)|Kevin McNamara]], brought up the issue in the House of Commons, asking the Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]], to refer the matter to the [[Security Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;Mr. McNamara, "State Security", [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1986/nov/27/state-security#S6CV0106P0_19861127_CWA_14 HC Deb 27 November 1986 vol 106 cc299-300W]&lt;/ref&gt; and asking then [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]] and Conservative MP [[Michael Havers, Baron Havers|Michael Havers]], to ask the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] to investigate allegations published in ''Lobster'' and prosecute Colin Wallace for revealing details of secret service operations against Her Majesty's Government.&lt;ref&gt;Mr. McNamara, "State Security", [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1986/nov/27/state-security-1#S6CV0106P0_19861127_CWA_76 HC Deb 27 November 1986 vol 106 c309W]&lt;/ref&gt; Both declined. Two weeks later, Labour MP [[Tam Dalyell]] asked the Prime Minister why she would not refer the matter to the Security Commission, but she said that she had nothing more to add.&lt;ref&gt;Tam Dalyell, State Security, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1986/dec/15/state-security#S6CV0107P0_19861215_CWA_63 HC Deb 15 December 1986 vol 107 c353W]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Who's Who of the British Secret State===
In 1989, British journalist [[Richard Norton-Taylor]] reported in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper, that ''Lobster'' was planning to publish "a list of the names and brief biographical details of more than 1,500 past and present officials involved, according to the publishers, in covert activities".&lt;ref name="nortontaylor1989"/&gt; A year later the article appeared in ''Lobster'' Issue 19,&lt;ref&gt;"First supplement to A Who's Who of the British Secret State", ''Lobster'' Issue 19, May 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and another appeared 18 months later.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Dorril, "Spooks", ''Lobster'' Issue 22, November 1991. {{ISSN|0964-0436}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other articles in the series include: (a) "Forty Years of Legal Thuggery. Part One A to B", ''Lobster'' Issue 9, September 1985. (b) Steve Dorril, "British Spooks "Who's Who" part 2", ''Lobster'' Issue 10, January 1986. (c) "Intelligence Personnel Named in 'Inside Intelligence'", ''Lobster'' Issue 15, February 1988. (d) Stephen Dorril, "Philby naming names: Brief Biographies of those Named in the Above", ''Lobster'' Issue 16, June 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''The Guardian'' noted that the Government was considering making the publication of such names a criminal offence, then ''Lobster'' co-editor Stephen Dorril noted that "All the names and details .. have been compiled by research in their local libraries or have already appeared in published books. 'No inside knowledge or breach of [[Official Secrets Act|official secrets]] was needed'"&lt;ref name="nortontaylor1989"/&gt; 10 years later, Ramsay was quoted in the ''Hull Daily Mail'', that "At the time it was a way of sticking two fingers up at the Government".&lt;ref&gt;Angus Young, "A DOZEN British intelligence officers named on the Internet this week were first identified by a Hull-based author 10 years ago", ''Hull Daily Mail'', 17 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

====House of Commons criticism====
[[File:BigBenHDR.jpg|thumb|right|Lobster was denounced in the House of Commons]]
Subsequently, ''Lobster'' was denounced in the British Parliament.&lt;ref name="Burnett2006"/&gt; Then [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Member of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] for [[Wycombe (UK Parliament constituency)|Wycombe]], [[Ray Whitney (politician)|Ray Whitney]], criticised the publication of the names in the House of Commons on 21 December 1988 in a debate on a proposed [[Official Secrets Act 1989|Official Secrets Bill]], when he commented that:
:"A small obscure magazine published, I think, in Hull and called, would hon. Members believe, ''Lobster'' makes a practice of publishing names of gentlemen who are alleged to be members of the security services. That creates danger and I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Member for [[Old Bexley and Sidcup (UK Parliament constituency)|Old Bexley and Sidcup]] shares my deep apprehension about that sort of practice being allowed to continue."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1988/dec/21/official-secrets-bill#S6CV0144P0_19881221_HOC_328 Mr Witney]", HC Deb 21 December 1988 vol 144 cc460-546&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Politics and Paranoia'', Ramsay criticised Whitney's role as the head of the Foreign Office's [[Information Research Department]] which Ramsay described as the "State's official, anti-left psy-war outfit", and had omitted to tell the Commons before denouncing him.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Ramsay, ''Politics and Paranoia'', Publisher Picnic Publishing, 2008, {{ISBN|0955610540}}, 9780955610547, p. 300, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZAjTHORPDEC&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;ots=uiiIxGEv-n&amp;dq=denounced%20ramsay%20lobster%20commons&amp;pg=PA238#v=onepage&amp;q=denounced%20whitney&amp;f=false page 238]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In 1998, the ''[[Hull Daily Mail]]'' described the magazine as "a tiny but influential fringe political journal".&lt;ref&gt;Francis Elliott, "New Labour unshelled ", ''Hull Daily Mail'', 1 June 1998, Media, Books, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the magazine [[Red Pepper (magazine)|Red Pepper]] wrote that ''Lobster'' ".. succeeds on the quality of its writing... articles are well researched... human, passionate and honest...",&lt;ref&gt;"Multimedia: CD ROM: Lobster", ''Red Pepper'' magazine, issue No. 85, July 2001, page 14 ([http://www.redpepper.org.uk website])&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Fortean Times]]'' (who also syndicated a regular Lobster column by Ramsay) wrote that it  was "... immensely engrossing reading, ...an essential purchase for anyone interested in the machinations of the secret state",&lt;ref&gt;Mark Pilkington, "Cracking the secrecy clause", ''Fortean Times'',  Issue #145, April 2001, {{ISSN|0308-5899}}, page 55&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Green Anarchist]]'' magazine wrote that ''Lobster'' is "... an invaluable resource, and deserves to be widely read and much studied",&lt;ref&gt;"Lobster CD-ROM", ''Green Anarchist'', Issue 63, Summer 2001, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Direct Action (magazine)|Direct Action magazine]] described it as "a good read ... very revealing and worth it, just for the pub talk".&lt;ref&gt;"Lobster #40 / Lobster CD", ''Direct Action'' magazine, Issue #19, Summer 2001, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Robert McCrum]] in ''The Guardian'' describes ''Lobster'' as ".. a left-wing journal that offers succour to conspiracy theorists [..] a brave, bright beacon, a Quixotic piece of typically English amateurism that keeps the professionals on their toes".&lt;ref name="mccrum1991" /&gt; ''The Independent'' newspaper has described it as a "delightful and worthwhile publications, more footnote than story, that [..] delivers a comprehensive picture of a clandestine world which the Establishment would prefer remained secret".&lt;ref name="moonlight1993" /&gt;

Trade Magazine ''[[PRWeek]]'' describes ''Lobster'' as a "Hull-based intelligence magazine and conspiracy theorists' bible",&lt;ref&gt;"Letter from MI5: The spies who have come in from the cold ..", ''PR Week'', 29 July 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Conspiracy Encyclopedia'' described it as "the most influential publication in the parapolitical underground".&lt;ref name="Burnett2006" /&gt; Irish historical writer, [[Tim Pat Coogan]], in discussing a TV programme about Captain [[Fred Holroyd]] in relation to the Collin Wallace affair, noted that "some of the best writing on the Holroyd case is contained in smaller journals published contemporaneously, notably ''Lobster'', ''Private Eye'', and, in particular [Duncan] Campbell's own series [..] in the ''Statesman''".&lt;ref&gt;Tim Pat Coogan, ''The Troubles: Ireland's Ordeal and the Search for Peace'', Publisher Palgrave Macmillan, 2002, {{ISBN|0312294182}}, 9780312294182, 496 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=33sWKhmPl3UC&amp;lpg=PA533&amp;ots=s6AdH2-Thq&amp;dq=lobster%20%22colin%20wallace%22%20ramsay&amp;pg=PA533#v=onepage&amp;q=lobster&amp;f=false page 533], note 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of Media and Culture at [[Edinburgh Napier University]], [[Chris Atton]], notes that a reference at the end of an article in ''Lobster'' led to the founding of the activist librarians' group [[Information for Social Change]].&lt;ref&gt;Chris Atton, "Parapolitics and Deep Politics" in ''Alternative literature: a practical guide for librarians'', publisher: Gower, 1996, {{ISBN|0566076659}}, 9780566076657, 202 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zeXgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Information+for+Social+Change%22#search_anchor page 138]&lt;/ref&gt; CIA curator, Hayden B. Peake notes that a British journalist described "much of its content its impenetrable", but that it was also intriguing.&lt;ref name="peake1992" /&gt;

A '''local shared object''' ('''LSO'''), commonly called a '''Flash cookie''' (due to its similarity with an [[HTTP cookie]]), is a piece of data that websites which use [[Adobe Flash]] may store on a user's computer. Local shared objects have been used by all versions of [[Flash Player]] (developed by Macromedia, which was later acquired by [[Adobe Systems]]) since version 6.&lt;ref name="adobe-lso"&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/articles/lso/

Flash cookies, which can be stored or retrieved whenever a user accesses a page containing a Flash application, are a form of local storage. Similar to that of cookies, they can be used to store user preferences, save data from [[Flash game]]s, or to track users' Internet activity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/05/cookies-crumbled-internet-anonymity The Guardian newspaper, When the cookies crumbled, so did your web anonymity, 5 October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; LSOs have been criticised as a breach of [[browser security]], but there are now browser settings and addons to limit the duration of their storage.

== Storage ==
Local shared objects contain data stored by individual websites. Data is stored in the [[Action Message Format]]. With the default settings, the Flash Player does not seek the user's permission to store local shared objects on the hard disk. By default, a [[SWF]] application running in Flash Player from version 9 to 11 (as of Sept 1, 2011) may store up to {{nowrap|100 kB}} of data to the user's hard drive. If the application attempts to store more, a dialog asks the user whether to allow or deny the request.&lt;ref name="adobe_sec_wp"&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/beta/reference/actionscript/3/flash/net/SharedObject.html
 |title = ActionScript Documentation Reference for Adobe Flash Platform
 |publisher=[[Adobe Systems]]
 |date=2011-08-22
 |accessdate=2011-09-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adobe Flash Player does not allow third-party local shared objects to be shared across [[domain name|domains]]. For example, a local shared object from "www.example.com" cannot be read by the domain "www.example.net".&lt;ref name="adobe-lso" /&gt; However, the first party website can always pass data to a third party via some settings found in the dedicated [[XML]] file and passing the data in the request to the third party. Also, third party LSOs are allowed to store data by default.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url= https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/articles/thirdpartylso/
 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100529082424/http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/articles/thirdpartylso/

 |title= How to disable third-party local shared objects
 |work = Support
 |publisher = Adobe Systems
 |accessdate = 2011-08-15
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By default LSO data is shared across browsers on the same machine.  As an example:

* A visitor accesses a site using their Firefox browser, then views a page displaying a specific product, then closes the Firefox browser, the information about that product can be stored in the LSO.
* If that same visitor, using the same machine now opens an Internet Explorer browser and visits any page from the site viewed in Firefox, the site can read the LSO value(s) in the Internet Explorer browser, and display dynamic content or otherwise target the visitor.

This is distinct from cookies which have directory isolated storage paths for saved cookies while LSOs use a common directory path for all browsers on a single machine.

=== Application to games ===
[[Flash games]] may use LSO files to store the user's personal game data, such as user preferences and actual game progress. Backing up files such as these requires some technical understanding of software. However, both browser updates and programs designed to remove unused files may delete this data.

To prevent cheating, games may be designed to render LSO files unusable if acquired from another location.

== Privacy concerns ==
As with HTTP cookies, local shared objects can be used by web sites to collect information on how people navigate them, although users have taken steps to restrict data collection.&lt;ref name="networkworld"&gt;{{cite news
 |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/081109-study-adobe-flash-cookies-pose.html

On 10 August 2009, [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'' magazine]] reported that more than half of the top websites used local shared objects to track users and store information about them but only four of them mentioned it in their privacy policy. "Flash cookies are relatively unknown to web users," it said, "even if a user thinks they have cleared their computer of tracking objects, they most likely have not." The article further says that some websites use Flash cookies as hidden backups, so that they can restore HTTP cookies deleted by users.&lt;ref name="wired-you-deleted-your-cookies-think-again"&gt;{{cite news

According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', by July 2010 there had been at least five class-action lawsuits in the United States against media companies for using local shared objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Local shared objects were the first subject to be discussed in the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) roundtable in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/01/29/BUMN1BP4MN.DTL |title=All eyes on online privacy |author=James Temple |date=2010-01-29  |publisher=San Francisco Cronicle |accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz has been talking with Adobe about what it describes as "the Flash problem."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/12/04/ftc-says-its-talking-to-adobe-about-the-problem-with-flash-cook/ |title=FTC says it's talking to Adobe about the problem with 'Flash cookies' |author=Donald Melanson |date=2010-12-04  |publisher=Engadget |accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== User control ===
Users can disable local shared objects using the ''Global Storage Settings panel'' of the online Settings Manager at Adobe's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html
 |title=Global Storage Settings panel
 |work = Flash Player Help
 |publisher = Adobe Systems
 |date = 2009-07-14
 |accessdate = 2011-05-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this places a permanent flash cookie on the computer, informing all other websites that the user does not want flash cookies stored on their computer. Users can opt out of LSOs from specified sites from Flash Player's "Settings", accessed by right-clicking the Player, or using the ''Website Storage Settings'' panel; the latter also allows users to delete local shared objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html
 |title = Website Storage Settings panel
 |work = Flash Player Help
 |publisher = Adobe Systems
 |date = 2009-07-14
 |accessdate = 2011-05-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users may also delete local shared objects either manually or using third-party software. For instance, [[CCleaner]], a standalone computer program for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X, allows users to delete local shared objects on demand. There is also a [[Add-on (Mozilla)|Firefox add-on]], Clear Flash Cookies, which will automatically clear out all LSOs each time the browser is restarted.&lt;ref name="ClearFlashAddon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clear-flash-cookies/|title=Clear Flash Cookies – Add-ons for Firefox|work=Firefox Add-ons|publisher=[[Mozilla]]|date=November 20, 2017|accessdate=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since version 10.3 of Flash, the Online Settings Manager (letting users configure privacy and security permissions via Adobe's website) is superseded by the Local Settings Manager on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms. It can be accessed via the [[Control Panel (Windows)|Windows Control Panel]] or [[System Preferences|Mac OS System Preferences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate = 2012-04-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users of other operating systems still use the Adobe Online Settings Manager. Since at least April 2012 (v 11.2.202.233), updating by downloading a new Flash version resets the security and privacy settings to the defaults of allowing [[Web storage#Local and session storage|local storage]] and asking for media access again, which may be against users' wishes.

=== Browser control ===
{{Primary sources|section|date=March 2012}}
Browser control refers to the web browser's ability to delete local shared objects and to prevent the creation of persistent local shared objects when [[privacy mode]] is enabled. As for the former, [[Internet Explorer 8]], released on March 19, 2009,&lt;ref name="Internet Explorer 8"&gt;{{Cite news

Also on January 5, 2011, Adobe Systems, [[Google Inc.]], and [[Mozilla Foundation]] finalized a new browser API (dubbed ''NPAPI ClearSiteData''). This will allow browsers implementing the API to clear local shared objects.&lt;ref name="adobe late response"&gt;{{cite news

As for the behavior in browser's privacy mode, Adobe Flash Player 10.1, released on June 10, 2010, supports the privacy modes of Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari. Local shared objects created in privacy are discarded at the end of the session. Those created in a regular session are also not accessible in privacy mode.&lt;ref name="adobe late response2"&gt;{{cite news

=== File locations ===
The default storage location for local shared objects is operating system-dependent, and depends on the flash plugin being [[NPAPI]] or [[PPAPI]].

====NPAPI====
On [[Microsoft Windows]] NT 5.x and 6.x, they are stored in:&lt;ref name=flash_cookie_forensics&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://computer-forensics.sans.org/blog/2009/08/28/flash-cookie-forensics/
 |title=Flash Cookie Forensics

 |publisher=SANS Computer Forensics Blog
 |accessdate=2011-07-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* %APPDATA%\Macromedia\Flash Player\#SharedObjects\
* %APPDATA%\Macromedia\Flash Player\macromedia.com\support\flashplayer\sys\

On [[Mac OS X]], they are stored in:
* ~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash Player/#SharedObjects/
* ~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash Player/macromedia.com/support/flashplayer/sys/

On [[Linux]] or [[Unix]], they are stored in:
* ~/.macromedia/Flash_Player/#SharedObjects/
* ~/.macromedia/Flash_Player/macromedia.com/support/flashplayer/sys/

For Linux and Unix systems, if the open-source [[Gnash (software)|Gnash]] plugin is being used instead of the official Adobe Flash, they will instead be found at:
* ~/.gnash/SharedObjects/

====PPAPI====
When using Google Chrome the location for the Pepper Flash (PPAPI) storage is:
* '''Windows:''' %localappdata%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Pepper Data\Shockwave Flash\WritableRoot\#SharedObjects
* '''Mac OS X:''' ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Pepper Data/Shockwave Flash/WritableRoot/#SharedObjects/
* '''Linux:''' ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Pepper Data/Shockwave Flash/WritableRoot/#SharedObjects/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4375">The duties of a '''Marriage Commissioner''' or '''Deputy Marriage Commissioner''' vary between jurisdictions.

Deputy or temporary marriage commissioners are generally empowered to perform [[Civil Marriage]] ceremonies during a fixed time and/or in a fixed place. Most often, these are officials for a specific [[marriage]] where the couple wants someone special to perform the ceremony, after which their appointment expires.

Other times, however, a deputy can be employed by the [[county clerk]] to perform civil ceremonies when regular staff are unable to do so or are overwhelmed. Such was the case in February–March 2004 in [[San Francisco, California]] where dozens of volunteers helped alleviate the [[Gay Marriage#2004|backlog of same-sex couples]] seeking marriages.

In some jurisdictions, a civil authority recognised to solemnise marriage (such as the clerk of a county or municipality) is empowered to delegate that authority to one or a handful of marriage commissioners on a long-term basis; in others, the appointments are made by a province or state government agency.

Splitting the marriage commissioner tasks from those of judge, city clerk or minister of religion can provide couples more flexibility in choosing a venue for a wedding; instead of bringing the couple to a church, town hall or court house, a local commissioner may use their own transport to go to the chosen site of a [[destination wedding]].

==By jurisdiction==

* [[Alaska]] Statute 25.05.261(a)(2) 1, allows anyone 18 years of age or older (including friends, relatives or non-residents of the United States) to perform a marriage ceremony if they first obtain a marriage commissioner appointment from an Alaskan court. The marriage license application and instructions are available on the Vital Statistics website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://courts.alaska.gov/comm.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930004317/http://www.courts.alaska.gov/comm.htm |archivedate=2014-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3679">A '''Member of Youth Parliament''' ('''MYP'''), is an individual aged between 11 and 18 elected by young people to represent their local area on the [[UK Youth Parliament]]. There are currently around 600 MYPs (including deputies) across the [[United Kingdom]].

==History and Election Process==
The title of Member of Youth Parliament was created upon the organisation's formation in July 1999. Though only a smaller number existed at first, this has now expanded beyond 600 members, with 1625 young people standing for the position in their local areas during the 2008 annual elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/ukypdebatable/issue7/elections.pdf|title=Debatable, Issue Seven|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108053124/http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/ukypdebatable/Issue7/elections.pdf|archivedate=2009-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of these elections differs from area to area, dependent on how the associated local government and youth bodies feel to be the best option for their circumstances. This ranges from a traditional [[Plurality voting system|First Past The Post]], to an [[United States of America|American]]-styled [[Electoral college|Electoral College]].
Unlike [[United Kingdom general elections|General Election]]s, these do not all occur at the same time, being spaced out across the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/204867/214330.html|title=Dates for UKYP Elections|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928042928/http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/204867/214330.html|archivedate=2009-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each member has at least one deputy (DMYP) that is able to fulfill their duties should they be unable. This number is not limited, as it again varies on the circumstances of the area in which the MYP is based. However MYPs from Scotland do not have DMYPs.

Scotland does not directly elect MYPs. The [[Scottish Youth Parliament]] has 200 Members of the Scottish Youth Parliament (MSYPs) by electing 2 in every Scottish Parliament constituency which returns 146 constituency MSYPs. The other 56 are appointed from voluntary organisations. Delegates to UKYP events are chosen by the [[Scottish Youth Parliament]].

==Roles==
The roles of Members and Deputy Members of the Youth Parliament are based around providing a loud and active voice for the young people that they represent. This includes working in their local area with the likes of town and parish councillors and their own [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MP]]. They may also liaise with community action groups, schools, colleges, youth forums and youth centers so as to broaden their audience as widely as possible.
They also act on a regional basis, attending monthly meetings in which they work on developing the issues they feel most important to young people.

An Annual Sitting is held which all members are welcome to attend. Special debates are also held within the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and [[House of Lords]]. Both of these instances are historic in their overturning of ancient protocol, requiring that only members of the respective houses be allowed to sit within them.

'''Military administration''' identifies both the techniques and [[system]]s used by military departments, agencies, and [[Armed Services]] involved in the management of the armed forces. It describes the processes that take place within [[military organisation]]s outside [[combat]], particularly in managing [[military personnel]], their [[Military education and training|training]], and services they are provided with as part of their [[soldier|military service]]. In many ways military administration serves the same role as [[public administration]] in the [[civil society]], and is often sited as a source of [[bureaucracy]] in the government as a whole. Given the wide area of application, military administration is often qualified by specific areas of application within the [[military]], such as [[Military logistics|logistics]] administration, administration of [[Military doctrine|doctrine]] development or [[military reform]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;p.xxiv, Weber, Eliasson&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2525">The '''Nash-Fortenberry UFO sighting''' was an [[unidentified flying object]] sighting that occurred on July 14, 1952, when two commercial [[pilot (aeronautics)|pilots]] (William B. Nash and William H. Fortenberry) claimed to have seen eight UFOs flying in a tight [[echelon formation]] over [[Chesapeake Bay]] in the state of [[Virginia]]. 

UFOlogists say the pilots observation allowed for relatively precise measurements of the objects' motion and size when compared to known landmarks, and that the encounter was corroborated by several groups of independent ground witnesses. The case was listed in the U.S. Air Force's [[Project Blue Book]] as an "unknown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicap.org/reports/nash-tulien.htm |title=Thomas Thulien. Revisiting One of the Classics: The 1952 Nash/Fortenberry Sighting |access-date=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Howard Menzel]] in his book ''The World of Flying Saucers'' (1963) suggested some possible naturalistic explanations. He suggested that the pilots may have seen lights on the ground that were distorted by [[haze]]. He later suggested they may have seen [[Firefly|fireflies]] that were trapped between the panes of glass in their [[cockpit]] window.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Howard Menzel|Menzel, Donald Howard]]. (1963). ''The World of Flying Saucers: A Scientific Examination of a Major Myth of the Space Age''. Doubleday. pp. 260-265&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptical researcher [[Steuart Campbell]] suggested the pilots UFO sighting was a [[Mirage of astronomical objects|mirage]] of [[Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steuart Campbell|Campbell, Steuart]]. (1994). ''The UFO Mystery Solved''. Explicit Books. pp. 70-71 . {{ISBN|0-9521512-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Liberal Party''', was a [[liberalism|liberal]] political party in the [[United Kingdom]] from 1922 to 1923. It was created as a formal party organisation for those Liberals, led by Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], who supported the Coalition Government (1918-22) and subsequently a revival of the Coalition, after it ceased holding office. It was a formal breakaway from the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. It was wound up in 1923 when Lloyd George agreed a merger with the Liberal Party.

==History==
===Origin===
The "[[Coalition Coupon]]", often referred to as '''‘the coupon’''', referred to the letter sent to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]]ary candidates at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 elections]], endorsing them as official representatives of the [[United Kingdom coalition government (1916–1922)|Coalition Government]]. The 1918 election took place in the heady atmosphere of victory in the First World War and the desire for revenge against Germany and its allies. Receiving the coupon was interpreted by the electorate as a sign of patriotism that helped candidates gain election, while those who did not receive it had a more difficult time as they were sometimes seen as anti-war or pacifist. The letters were all dated 20 November 1918 and were signed by prime minister [[David Lloyd George]] for the Coalition [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] and [[Bonar Law]], the leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. As a result, the 1918 general election has become known as 'the coupon election'.

The letters all contained the same simple text:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dear ''(name of candidate)''

We have much pleasure in recognizing you as the Coalition Candidate for ''(name of constituency)''.
We have every hope that the Electors will return you as their Representative in Parliament to support the government in the great task which lies before it.

Yours truly,

D. Lloyd George

A. Bonar Law
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some coalition candidates included the wording of the letter in their election addresses.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Douglas, ''History of the Liberal Party: 1895-1970''; Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, 1971 p.121&lt;/ref&gt;

Following confidential negotiations between Lloyd George’s Coalition [[Chief Whip]], [[Freddie Guest]], and [[George Younger, 1st Viscount Younger of Leckie|George Younger]], Chairman of the Conservative Party, over the summer of 1918, it was agreed that 150 Liberals were to be offered the support of the prime minister and the leader of the Conservative Party at the next general election.&lt;ref&gt;[[K O Morgan]], ''Lloyd George’s Stage Army: The Coalition Liberals, 1918-1922'' in [[A J P Taylor]] (ed.) ''Lloyd George: Twelve Essays''; Hamish Hamilton, 1971 p 227&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the figures recorded in Trevor Wilson’s book, ''The Downfall of the Liberal Party'', 159 Liberal candidates received the ‘coupon’. A few of these were Liberal supporters of [[H. H. Asquith]]. Of those Liberals receiving the ‘coupon’ 136 were elected, whereas only 29 who did not receive the ‘coupon’ were returned to Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Trevor ''The Downfall of the Liberal Party'' p393&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Liberal and Conservative candidates who received the ‘coupon’ some letters were also sent to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] supporters of the Coalition (although most were repudiated by the official Labour Party)&lt;ref&gt;David Powell, ''British Politics, 1910-1935''; Routledge, 2004 p80&lt;/ref&gt; and some to members the '"patriotic labour" [[National Democratic and Labour Party|National Democratic Party]].

===Government===
Lloyd George had replaced the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] leader [[H. H. Asquith]] as Prime Minister in 1916, at the head of a coalition ministry most of whose Parliamentary members were [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]. Asquith and many of his leading colleagues went into opposition, but at first it was not clear that the division in the Liberal Party would result in a formal party split.

Lloyd George and the Conservative leader [[Bonar Law|Andrew Bonar Law]] decided to continue the coalition after the end of the First World War. The two leaders agreed to issue a letter to a single government supporter in most constituencies for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 general election]], which thus became known as the 'coupon election'. Not all loyal MPs got [[The Coalition Coupon|the coupon]] and some who were offered it rejected the support, but this marked a formal division between Coalition Liberal supporters of Lloyd George and those Liberals loyal to Asquith and the official party.

After the coalition won the general election and the non-coalition wing of the party had suffered catastrophic defeat, the split in the Liberal Party became deeper. Of the 36 Liberal MPs elected without the coupon, nine supported the coalition. The others held a meeting and declared themselves to be the Liberal Parliamentary Party. During the course of the Parliament, the split spread through highest and lowest levels of the party organisation. At a meeting of the National Liberal Federation in May 1920, coalition ministers were shouted down, and the division became even more obvious.

===Reunion===
Eventually, despairing of capturing the official Liberal Party, tainted with [[apostasy]] and awkward hypocrisy but adamant on the need to compromises to solve major social, micro- and macro-economic problems, the Prime Minister decided to set up his own party. A meeting was held in London on 18 and 19 January 1922. Its own [[National Liberal Council]] was formed. The division was complete, with members rapidly deciding with which arm of the party to side.

Upon the Conservatives withdrawing from the Coalition, Lloyd George resigned as Prime Minister on 19 October 1922. The [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|general election]] that followed was disastrous for both Liberal parties. Only 62 Liberals and 53 National Liberals were elected.

With the end of the coalition, the National Liberals had lost their reason for existing as a separate party. However, the bitterness caused by years of internal struggles made immediate Liberal reunion impossible and two parties retained their separate party organisations.

===Dissolution===
The political landscape was changed once more when the new Prime Minister and Conservative leader [[Stanley Baldwin]] decided to call a general election to seek a mandate to abandon [[free trade]] and introduce tariffs. Despite the deep hostility between the leaders of the Liberal and National Liberal parties, the call for a defence of [[Free Trade]] once more enabled all of them to unite around their most distinctive policy.

On 13 November 1923, the leaders of the two Liberal parties declared that "all candidates will be adopted and described as Liberals, and will be supported by the whole strength of the Party without regard to any past differences". This declaration marked the end of the National Liberal party – along with the stopping of its journal, the ''[[Lloyd George Liberal Magazine]]'', in the same month. However, the money that the Coalition Liberal/National Liberals had accumulated from the sale of honours and other donations to finance the party were retained by Lloyd George as a separate political fund. It was officially known as the National Liberal Party fund in 1925 and then changed its name to Lloyd George's Political fund in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Ivor.''Party Politics: Volume 2: The Growth of Parties, Volume 2.'' 1961. Cambridge University Press. p264&lt;/ref&gt;. This fund would remain a source of constant friction in the reunited Liberal party and would later lead to further divisions in the 1930s before disappearing in 1945 when Lloyd George's son [[Gwilym Lloyd George]] who was the only surviving trustee of the fund deposited what was left into a private bank account.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1923 election about half the former National Liberals lost their seats. [[Winston Churchill]], who had lost his Dundee seat in the 1922 general election as a National Liberal failed to be re-elected as a Liberal for Leicester in 1923. Churchill would return to the House of Commons as a "[[Constitutionalist (UK)|Constitutionalist]]" at the 1924 general election and rejoined the Conservative party the following year. Others, like former cabinet minister [[Christopher Addison]], had already joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], whilst many former leading members of the National Liberals, including [[Frederick Guest]] and [[Alfred Mond]], would eventually join Churchill and move over to the Conservative Party by the end of the 1920s.

==Legacy==
As [[Margaret Cole]]’s memoir of the time makes clear, many competent and patriotic candidates who did not receive the ‘coupon’, including sitting Liberal and Labour MPs, found themselves categorised as somehow anti-war or pacifist as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Cole, ''Women of Today''; Nelson &amp; Sons, 1938 republished by Read Books, 2007 p126&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Percy Harris, 1st Baronet|Sir Percy Harris]], who had been MP for [[Harborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Harborough]] since 1916 recorded that once the ‘coupon’ had been allocated to his Conservative opponent it was interpreted as a personal reflection upon him by his constituents who assumed he must have done something wrong for the Liberal prime minister to be seen offering his open support to a rival.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Percy, ''Forty Years In and Out of Parliament''; Andrew Melrose 1949 p76&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most historians have since agreed that the coupon essentially sealed the fate of those Liberals who were not fortunate enough to receive the Coalition's backing. Those Liberals that Lloyd George chose to abandon were left defenceless against Coalition candidates, who had a full claim on the spirit of national unity and patriotism that characterised Britain's war weary mood following the end of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;''The 1918 coupon election''; [[Liberal Democrat History Group]] website, 2008: {{cite web |url=http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=58&amp;item=history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729145840/http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=58&amp;item=history |archivedate=29 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The election result was catastrophic for these Asquithian Liberals, who were decimated in the Coupon election. Only 28 were returned, and even [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]] lost the seat he had held in [[East Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|East Fife]] since the [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|1886 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times, House of Commons 1919''; Politico’s Publishing, 2004 p10&lt;/ref&gt;. Though the Liberal and National Liberals fought the 1923 election as one party, the political legacy of these earlier divisions would remain under the surface and re-emerge in the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|British economic and political crisis of 1931]].

The front issued three demands to Morsi during the [[2012 Egyptian protests]]. The demands were: that the constitutional declaration be rescinded, that the [[Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2012|referendum]] be called off, and that a new constituent assembly be formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Opposition marches condemn the violence|url=http://dailynewsegypt.com/2012/12/06/opposition-marches-condemn-the-violence/|agency=Daily News Egypt|date=6 December 2012|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morsi announced that one decree, granting him unlimited power to make laws without judicial review, had been annulled as of 8 December 2012, but the constitutional referendum went ahead as planned for 15 and 22 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Morsi's decree cancelled, constitution referendum to take place on time|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/60092/Egypt/Politics-/Morsis-decree-cancelled,-constitution-referendum-t.aspx|agency=Ahram Online|date=9 December 2012|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ouster of Morsi by the Egyptian military, a number of politicians from the National Salvation Front were moved into power, including three women.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Key figures of the Front include [[Hamdeen Sabahi]], [[Amr Moussa]] and Hussein Abdul Ghani.&lt;ref name=bbcprofile/&gt; Sameh Ashour, another leading figure, is the spokesperson for the Front.&lt;ref name=bbcprofile/&gt;

==Criticisms==
The coalition was criticized by the student members of the Constitution Party, Socialist Popular Alliance, and the Egyptian Popular Current for having members of the former regime (known as ''feloul''). They are pushing their parties to leave the coalition.&lt;ref name="AO28Nov"/&gt; [[Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh]], the head of the [[Strong Egypt Party]], said that he will not join the coalition because he would never join forces with former regime members.&lt;ref name=ei2912&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/civil-groups-pounce-political-space-seen-pro-democracy-triumph|title=Civil groups' pounce into political space seen as pro-democracy triumph|publisher=Egypt Independent|date=29 November 2012|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akram Ismail, who is an activist and a former member of the [[Socialist Popular Alliance Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/11/09/social-popular-alliance-party-shaken-by-304-resignations/|title=Social Popular Alliance Party shaken by 304 resignations|publisher=Daily News Egypt|date=9 November 2013|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued the distinction between ''feloul'' and non-''feloul'' did not matter, stating that "the battle now is between the oppressive Islamist alliance and the ascending democratic force".&lt;ref name=ei2912/&gt;

[[Khaled Dawoud]] resigned as a spokesperson for the National Salvation Front on 16 August 2013 in protest at the support of police violence against [[Mohamed Morsi]] supporters by the NSF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=NSF says Egypt facing attempts by Muslim Brotherhood to overthrew state|agency=Ahram Online|date=19 August 2013|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/79454.aspx|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Non-European Unity Movement''' ('''NEUM''') is a [[Trotsky]]ist organisation formed in [[South Africa]] in 1943.&lt;ref name="saho_neum"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/organisations/non-european-unity-movement-neum | title=A Short history of the Non-European Unity – An insider's view | publisher=South African History Online | accessdate=4 May 2015 | author=Baruch Hirson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its roots lay in the Workers Party of South Africa (WPSA), the first countrywide Trotskyist organisation, and was initially conceived as a broad protest front. It proposed a 10 Point Programme of radical reforms.&lt;ref name="saho_neum"/&gt; It stressed [[non-racialism]], meaning that it rejected race-based organising (and the concept of race itself), unlike the main nationalist groups of the time, was highly critical of the [[South African Communist Party]] and the [[African National Congress]], and made a principle of non-collaboration with the [[apartheid]] regime and its allies &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amandlapublishers.co.za/magazines/102/1104 The ANC Transformed], by Mercia Andrews, ''[[Amandla Magazine]], April 2012 {{Dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement developed a substantial influence in the [[Cape Province]], including [[Pondoland]], and had some role in the 1950-1961 Pondoland peasant revolt, but split in 1957. The faction around [[I.B. Tabata]] formed a new [[African Peoples' Democratic Union of Southern Africa]] (APDUSA) in 1961, and the Unity Movement of South Africa (UMSA) in exile in 1964, and engaged in armed struggle.&lt;ref&gt;'Robin Kayser &amp; Mohamed Adhikari, 2004, "Peasant and Proletarian: A History of the African Peoples' Democratic Union of Southern Africa," ''Kleio'', volume 36, number 1, pp. 5-27&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition's influence was wider than its membership: for example, notable Marxist [[Neville Alexander]], who helped found the Yu Chi Chan Club (YCCC) in 1961, and the National Liberation Front (NLF) in 1962, came from a NEUM / APUDSA background. Until the 1970s, the Unity Movement tradition was arguaby the largest Trotskyist current in southern Africa.

All of its sectors suffered heavily from 1960s [[apartheid]] repression, some ending up on [[Robben Island]]. However, the current survived, launching the New Unity Movement in 1985, with APDUSA and NEUM backing. APDUSA remains active today &lt;ref name="APDUSA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apdusa.org.za/| title=APDUSA: The African Peoples' Democratic Union of Southern Africa | publisher=APUDUSA| accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publishes the ''APUDUSAN Newsletter'',&lt;ref name="''APUDUSAN Newsletter''"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apdusa.org.za/newsletter//| title= ''APUDUSAN Newsletter'' | publisher=APUDUSA| accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; following in the steps pf ''APDUSA Views'' from the 1980s, and ''Unity'' from the 1960s.&lt;ref name="''APDUSA Views''"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apdusaviews.co.za/repos.php//| title= ''APUDUSA Views''| accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jayapal worked with [[Paine Webber|PaineWebber]] as a financial analyst after graduating from Northwestern. In her time at PaineWebber, Jayapal developed a desire to apply her financial prowess to the good of society, and began spending time working on development projects from Chicago to Thailand.

A '''prize of war''' is a piece of enemy property or land seized by a belligerent party during or after a war or battle, typically at sea. This term was used nearly exclusively in terms of captured ships during the 18th and 19th centuries.
==Basis in international law==
[[Prize (law)|Rules]] defining how prizes were claimed and administered originated before there were organized government navies and were an outgrowth of [[privateering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Prize Game, The: Lawful Looting on the High Seas in the Days of Fighting Sail| first=Donald A.| last=Petrie | isbn=0-425-17829-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current international treaties provide for the retention of personal property by captured soldiers as well as issues of personal equipment in their possession when captured (including clothing, helmets, rank insignia and [[medal|medals]], and protective equipment such as [[gas mask|gas masks]]), but excluding certain issue items such as weapons, horses, maps, and military documents. Non-personal equipment, vehicles, artillery pieces, ships, stockpiles of food and equipment and other material are outside the scope of these treaties.&lt;ref name="ircihl49"&gt;{{cite web|title=Practice Relating to Rule 49. War Booty|publisher=Committee of the International Red Cross|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule49|access-date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Notable prize-takings==
[[File:Liberty-canon.jpg|thumb|left|Cannon taken [[Battle of Chapultepec|from Mexico]] in 1847, later captured in fighting in Kansas]]

Prizes in World War II included a German submarine later called {{HMS|Graph}}, and {{GS|U-505||2}} which was captured by elements of the [[United States Navy]] in a task force commanded by then-Captain [[Daniel V. Gallery]]. ''U-505'' currently is a [[museum ship]] at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago]].

Although not taken in combat, two [[Gorch Fock (1933)|Gorch Fock]] class barques were confiscated from Germany as [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947#War reparations|reparation prizes]] at the conclusion of World War II, one of which remains in US service as {{USCGC|Eagle|WIX-327}}. 

The passenger ship [[HMT Empire Windrush]], which had a notable role in the post-war history of the United Kingdom, was originally a German ship, confiscated after the war. The Russian ship ''[[Kruzenshtern (ship)|Kruzenshtern]]'', the largest traditional sailing vessel currently in operation, was originally the German ship ''Padua'', before being taken over by the Soviet Union in 1946.  

Quantities of Iraqi military materiel captured during the [[Gulf War]] are held by US museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|author=Charles H. Bogino|title=Captured Iraqi Gear Tells Story Of A Military Ill-prepared To Fight|date=17 December 1991|access-date=7 June 2017|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-12-17/features/9104230292_1_eustis-museum-iraqi-coalition-forces}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Argentine Mortar.jpg|Captured Argentine infantry equipment on display in the Imperial War Museum|thumb]]

[[Materiel]] captured as a result of the [[Falklands War]] was reused by the [[British Armed Forces]]. This included two [[Agusta A109]] helicopters captured by the [[British Army]], [[Special Air Service|SAS]] from the [[Argentine Army]] which were used by the Army Air Corps until 2007. Oerlikon GDF-002 AA guns and Skyguard FC radars were put into service by the Royal Aux Air Force for some 10 years.{{citation-needed|date=June 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24682">'''Reverse brain drain''' is a form of [[brain drain]] where [[human capital]] moves in reverse from a more [[developed country]] to a [[less developed country]] that is developing rapidly. These migrants may accumulate savings, also known as [[remittances]], and develop skills overseas that can be used in their home country.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, O &amp; Bloom, D.E. (1985). The new economics of labor migration. The American Economic Review. 75(2) p.173-178.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1805591]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brain drain can occur when scientists, engineers, or other intellectual elites migrate to a more developed country to learn in its universities, perform research, or gain working experience in areas where education and employment opportunities are limited in their home country. These professionals then return to their home country after several years of experience to start a related business, teach in a university, or work for a multi-national in their home country.&lt;ref name="Nature-Feb09"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cyranoski |first=David |date=19 February 2009 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=457 |issue=7232 |pages=953–5 |quote=High-temperature superconductor specialist Hong Ding had several attractive offers last year. But neither Boston University in Massachusetts, where he had been for a decade, nor any other institution could match the deal he was offered at the Institute of Physics in Beijing. "It is a matter of time before the United States becomes alarmed by this rapid '''reverse of the brain drain'''," says Ding. Dessau, who tried and failed to recruit Ding, says that "10 years ago it would have been unheard of [for a Chinese person to turn down a position in the United States]. But I wouldn't be surprised if the trend continues." |doi=10.1038/457953a |pmid=19225494 |title=Materials science: China's crystal cache}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their return is this "Reverse Brain Drain".

The occurrence of reverse brain drain mostly depends on the state of the country's [[International development|development]], and also strategies and planning over a long period of time to reverse the migration. Countries that are attractive to returning intelligentsia will naturally develop migration policies to attract foreign academics, professionals and executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Arp|first = Frithjof|date = 2014|title = Emerging giants, aspiring multinationals and foreign executives: Leapfrogging, capability building, and competing with developed country multinationals|journal = Human Resource Management|volume = 53|issue = 6|pages = 851–876|doi = 10.1002/hrm.21610}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Arp|first1 = Frithjof|last2 = Hutchings|first2 = Kate|last3 = Smith|first3 = Wendy A.|date = 2013|title = Foreign executives in local organisations: An exploration of differences to other types of expatriates|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258951786|journal = Journal of Global Mobility|volume = 1|issue = 3|pages = 312–335|doi = 10.1108/JGM-01-2013-0006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would also require these countries to develop an environment which will provide rewarding opportunities for those who have attained the knowledge and skills from overseas.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Observer. (2002). "International mobility of the highly skilled" Policy Brief. p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, many of the [[immigrants]] from [[developing countries]] chose to work and live permanently in [[developed countries]]; however, the recent [[economic growth]] that has been occurring back in their home countries – and the difficulty of attaining long-term work visas – has caused many of the immigrants to return home.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Jenny J. &amp; Kim, Dongbin (2010). "Brain gain or brain circulation? U.S. doctoral recipients returning to South Korea". Higher Education. 59:627-643. {{doi|10.1007/s10734-009-9270-5}}. p. 629 [http://springerlink.metapress.com/content/t57722r83141350t/fulltext.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The term ‘reverse brain drain' is closely tied with [[brain drain]] and [[brain gain]] because reverse brain drain is a migratory phenomenon that results due to the [[brain drain]] of the intellectual elites from [[developing countries]] and is the mirror image of the benefit of an inflow of high quality human resources which is [[brain gain]].&lt;ref name="Song, Hahzoong 1997 p. 332"&gt;Song, Hahzoong. (1997). "From brain drain to reverse brain drain: Three decades of the Korean experience. Science, Technology and Society. 2(2):317-345. p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse brain drain is sometimes related to the term ‘brain circulation', which is when migrants return to their own country on a regular or occasional basis, sharing the benefits of the skills and resources they have acquired while living and working abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Global Commission on International Migration. (2005). "Migration in an interconnected world: New directions for action"[http://www.gcim.org/attachements/gcim-complete-report-2005.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the benefits for the host countries, especially developing countries, are the payments of [[remittances]]. This provides a reason for governments to issue new legislation and tax rules that encourage outward migration and remittances.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Chacko.  (2007). "From brain drain to brain gain: reverse migration to Bangalore and Hyderabad, India's globalizing high tech cities". GeoJournal, 68(2-3), 131-140. p. 134 [http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=0&amp;did=1296937811&amp;SrchMode=1&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=6&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD&amp;TS=1286453472&amp;clientId=16532]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, "brain circulation" is known as the extended definition of [[brain gain]] with an emphasis on human capital circulation across nations in the global market, benefiting both the sending and receiving nations; in addition it is considered a two-way flow of skill, capital, and technology, unlike [[brain drain]] and reverse brain drain.&lt;ref&gt;Saxenian, AnnaLee (2005). "From brain drain to brain circulation: Transnational communities and regional upgrading in India and China". Studies in Comparative International Development. 40(2):35-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Another form===
Recently there is a different type of reverse brain drain developing. This form of reverse brain drain differs from the way it is commonly viewed. It is explained by [[Salman Khurshid]], the former Minister of State for Corporate and Minority Affairs in India. He states that "Many second-generation Indians are coming back to the country".&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;Press Trust of India. (2010). "Reverse brain drain in India has begun: Khurshid". The Times of India. [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-04-05/india/28129264_1_brain-drain-top-indian-minds-global-meltdown]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, reverse brain drain is no longer limited to the commonly perceived migration from a developed to a developing country by a [[first generation immigrant|first generation]] individual. Many of the world's top [[multinational corporation|multinational]] companies are beginning to send their top Indian minds to head their companies in India and have the idea of reverse brain drain which is, "So when we lose some, we win many back."&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"/&gt;

==Enhancing reverse brain drain==
The countries where reverse brain drain occurs are [[developing countries]], or are countries who have suffered a significant impact from the 'brain drain' from [[developed countries]]. Governments have attempted to reverse the flow of brain drain through implementing new contracts, scholarships, government policies, and several other methods. Three methods of implementing and enhancing reverse brain drain are through governments retaining their students, encouraging students to pursue tertiary studies abroad and promoting them to return, and engaging with the [[diasporas]] which will encourage expatriates to remit savings, act as bridges for foreign investment and trade, and facilitate the transfer of skills and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Jean-Baptiste &amp; Brown, Mercy. (1999). "Scientific diasporas: A new approach to the brain drain". World Conference on Science: UNESCO - ICSU. [http://www.unesco.org/most/meyer.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; There are several countries that are prime examples of these three methods – and several other methods – which are:

===Asia===

====China====
[[China]] has generally been seen as a developing country, and they have been impacted by brain drain through the migration of their talented minds to the developed world. 
What has assisted China in the flow of return migration are central government policies. These policies are changes in the domestic environment, the freedom to immigrate and emigrate freely, political stability, and changes in how the government uses people.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, David. (2006). "Competing for talent: China's strategies to reverse the brain drain". International Labour Review. 145:1-2. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1564-913X.2006.tb00010.x/pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the local government was involved in the enhancement of return migration by cities rewarding the returnees with large bonuses from their home unit.&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, David, Chung, Siu Fung, &amp; Vanhonacker, Wilfried. (2006). "Rewards of technology: Explaining China's reverse migration". Journal of International Migration and Integration. 7:449-471&lt;/ref&gt; There are also other reasons which encouraged the migration back to the home country, which were higher social status in China, better career opportunities in China, and patriotism.&lt;ref name= "korea"&gt;Lee, Jenny J. &amp; Kim, Dongbin (2010). "Brain gain or brain circulation? U.S. doctoral recipients returning to South Korea". Higher Education. 59:627-643. {{doi|10.1007/s10734-009-9270-5}}. [http://springerlink.metapress.com/content/t57722r83141350t/fulltext.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, competition among universities, research laboratories and enterprises has given the returning intellectual elites excellent incentives. For example, in the new life science school at Beijing's Tsinghua University, they were able to recruit many Chinese scientists who were previously in more developed countries like the United States due to China's booming economy, large government investment in research, and the chance to build a science program from the ground up.&lt;ref&gt;Engardio, Pete. (2009). "China's Reverse Brain Drain". BusinessWeek. 4157. [http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=1&amp;hid=110&amp;sid=1c5c524f-aec4-423a-9e03-f6198bd3bf9f%40sessionmgr104&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=buh&amp;AN=45397182#db=buh&amp;AN=45397182]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the government policies and economic reasons for returning to China, certain family factors influenced the decision to return, some of the reasons where parental views about returning, concerns for children, and the attitude of one's spouse about returning.&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, David, Changgui, Chen, &amp; Rosen, Stanley. (1995). "China's brain drain to the United States: View of overseas Chinese students and scholars in the 1990s. Institute of East Asian.  p. 44. [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=2993276]&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
India is one of the first countries where the phenomenon of reverse brain drain occurred. Previously, India was well known for being the country where numerous [[information technology]] students left for America for a better education and greater employment opportunities. The turning point was during the [[dot-com bubble]]. During this period many [[information technology]] experts were forced to return to India due to the slump and the loss of jobs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Chacko.  (2007). From brain drain to brain gain: reverse migration to Bangalore and Hyderabad, India's globalizing high tech cities. GeoJournal, 68(2-3), 131-140 [http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=0&amp;did=1296937811&amp;SrchMode=1&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=6&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD&amp;TS=1286453472&amp;clientId=16532]&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the Indian Government was unhappy of the occurrence of [[brain drain]]. Tens of thousands of migrants who had initially come to the U.S. for graduate engineering education, accepted jobs in [[Silicon Valley]] rather than return to their home countries, where professional opportunities were limited.&lt;ref name="springerlink.metapress.com"&gt;Saxenian, AnnaLee. (2005). "From brain drain to brain circulation: Transnational communities and regional upgrading in India and China". Studies in Comparative International Development. 40(2):35-61. [http://springerlink.metapress.com/content/a3wplr37wg603hh6/fulltext.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the [[dot-com bubble]] crisis, the economic and employment opportunities that existed back home; interested many Indian entrepreneurs to improve the economic development in the home country, which increased the number of returning intelligentsias to India.&lt;ref name="springerlink.metapress.com"/&gt;

In addition, other reasons for the returning migration of the Indian high skill workers was due to their desires to return to their roots, a more family oriented lifestyle, and also security concerns in the post [[9/11]] period where Indians were discriminated against because they were often mistaken for Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Chacko.  (2007). From brain drain to brain gain: reverse migration to Bangalore and Hyderabad, India's globalizing high tech cities. GeoJournal, 68(2-3), 131-140. p. 135 [http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=0&amp;did=1296937811&amp;SrchMode=1&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=6&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD&amp;TS=1286453472&amp;clientId=16532]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
In wake of the September 11 attacks and the financial crisis of 2007–2010, a large number of expatriates forming the [[Pakistani diaspora]] throughout North America, and even Europe, began to return to [[Pakistan]]. Many of these returning expatriates tended to have excellent credentials and due to their professional and cultural background were able to easily assimilate and find new job opportunities in the country – contributing to an overall "reverse brain drain" effect. One notable example is the media boom in Pakistan which inspired and prompted many overseas Pakistanis working in the field of journalism to return to the country and take up readily available positions in the country's largest press groups and channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7490555.stm | work=BBC News | title=Returning Pakistanis praise new lives | date=2008-07-06 | accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are over 47,000 [[Britons in Pakistan|British nationals in Pakistan]], many of whom are of Pakistani origin, who have returned to contribute to the economic development of the country.

====South Korea====
South Korea's reverse brain drain was different from the social phenomenon because it was based on an organized government effort with various policies and the political support of President [[Park Chung Hee]]. The main features of Korea's Reverse Brain Drain policies were the creation of a conducive domestic environment, and the empowerment of returnees.&lt;ref&gt;Yoon, Bang-Soon L. (1992). "Reverse brain drain in South Korea: A state-led model". Studies in Comparative International Development. 27(1):4-26. p. 4 [http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;hid=110&amp;sid=83ea8351-2ad1-4056-8e54-ec7526b998d8%40sessionmgr114]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the policies, there are also cultural incentives for the intellectual elites to return home which was the desire to improve Korea's economic conditions and competitiveness, the cultural differences between Korea and America, and family-related responsibilities and concerns.&lt;ref name="Song, Hahzoong 1997 p. 332"/&gt; Many of the students who migrated to the United States to study, especially the only son or the eldest of the family, felt obligated to return home to be with the family &lt;ref name="korea"/&gt;

====Taiwan====
Previously, [[Taiwan]] had experienced a loss of more than 80 percent of its students who had completed their graduate study in the United States, but the government of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) responded to this to increase the return migration of the students.&lt;ref name="web.ebscohost.com"&gt;Chang, Shirley L. (1992). "Causes of brain drain and solutions: The Taiwan experience". Studies in Comparative International Development. 27(1):27-43. p. 27. [http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;hid=110&amp;sid=d1240e1b-990d-4ccf-8ada-52cac05f4606%40sessionmgr104]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the action taken by the authorities of the [[Republic of China]] were the setting up of the National Youth Commission (NYC), a cabinet-level government office, and other organizations to recruit Taiwan's scholars abroad and carry out related programs. In addition, Taiwan's official policy consists of two sections:

# Improve and strengthen the institutions of higher learning at home
# Encourage Taiwan's "brain" in the [[United States]] to remigrate and/or contribute their talents and knowledge to Taiwan's national development.&lt;ref name="web.ebscohost.com"/&gt;

One reason behind the increased percentage of college students going abroad and the decline of returnees was due to Taiwan's [[Political status of Taiwan|political status]] and the severed diplomatic ties with the ROC government in 1979; however, the percentages of college students [[studying abroad|study abroad]] slowly started to increase after the political shock settle.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Thomas W. (1996). "America in Taiwan's post Cold-War foreign relations". The China Quarterly. 148:1340-1361. {{jstor|655527}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The two most cited reasons for returning to [[Taiwan]] in 1983 were highly normative pride and strong identification with Taiwan's developmental goal and desire to be in it.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Shirley L. (1992). "Causes of brain drain and solutions: The Taiwan experience". Studies in Comparative International Development. 27(1):27-43. p. 35. [http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;hid=110&amp;sid=d1240e1b-990d-4ccf-8ada-52cac05f4606%40sessionmgr104]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides these reasons,&lt;ref&gt;Liao, Chi-ching &amp; Tang, Ming-Yueh.(1984). "Research and analysis on the employment of the returned scholars and students". Taipei: National Youth Commission, Executive Yuan. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; there were other social and cultural reasons that were given by the returning migrants which were:

:* Never thought of staying in the U.S.
:* I have wife and children in Taiwan
:* My parents wanted me to come home
:* I was offered an ideal job in Taiwan
:* I could not find an ideal spouse in the U.S.
:* I was discriminated against in the U.S.
:* I could not find a good job in the U.S.

===Latin America===

====Mexico====
The federal government of [[Mexico]] has been implementing public policies, were included in the Program for the Support of Science and Research, which were designed to internationalize the domestic academic market and had the objective to repatriate young Mexican scientists who have obtained a postgraduate degree abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Aupetit, Sylvie Didou. (2006). "The brain drain in Mexico – a subject for research…or agenda?". Globalisation, Societies and Education, 4(1):103-120. p. 104. [http://pdfserve.informaworld.com/73765_751312207_743768442.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of the repatriation and retention of Mexican researchers from 1991–1996 and 2002 shows how there is a general increase of more Mexican researchers to return to Mexico and this can be viewed in the table below:&lt;ref&gt;CONACyT, 1996, 2003, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

|}
^ Previously known as Repatriation and Retention

Although these policies have been assisting in the slow returning migration of young Mexican scientists, the policies should be broadened out and not focused exclusively on individual scientists, due to the positive outcomes that may result from repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, J., Kaplan, DE, &amp; Charum, J (2001) "Scientific nomadism and the new geopolitics of knowledge". International Social Sciences Journal. 168:309-321.  [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2451.00317/pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
In [[Africa]], instead of the commonly termed ‘brain drain', the term ‘reverse transfer of technology' (RTT)  is used to describe the migration of scientists from developing countries to overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Ikubolajeh B. (2009). "The reverse and return transfer of technology (RRTT): Towards a comprehensive model of the migration of African Experts". International Migration, 47: 93–127. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2435.2008.00509.x}}. p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to prevent the loss of the experts, Africa has observed the "friends and relatives effect", which identifies professional, societal and personal factors as the three imperatives underlying the decision of African students in the United States to return home.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Ikubolajeh B. (2009). "The reverse and return transfer of technology (RRTT): Towards a comprehensive model of the migration of African Experts". International Migration, 47: 93–127. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2435.2008.00509.x}}. p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the most widespread instrument used by African countries to combat the brain drain is bonding, which obligates a graduate to return home for a required period of time before s/he can emigrate or to also have bilateral agreements with developed countries, which will require them to return home immediately upon graduation.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Ikubolajeh B. (2009). "The reverse and return transfer of technology (RRTT): Towards a comprehensive model of the migration of African Experts". International Migration, 47: 93–127. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2435.2008.00509.x}}. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches are influenced from the policies that exist and worked in Asian countries.

==Associated problems==
The problem of a reverse brain drain is exacerbated by anxiety in developed countries.  This is of particular concern in the [[Affirmative action in the United States|United States of America]], where not enough undergraduate students are seeking advanced degrees at the doctorate level. This leads to several consequences. Initially, it increases the widespread replacement of native-born with [[foreign born]] professionals and academics in the areas of greatest intellectual and economic interest to the developed country.&lt;ref name="smartplanet.com"&gt;McKendrick, Joe. (2009). "Brain drain: Why many of our best and brightest are going home". Smartplanet.[http://www.smartplanet.com/business/blog/business-brains/brain-drain-why-many-of-our-best-and-brightest-are-going-home/2764/]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a problem since foreign-born professional and academics from developing countries, such as China or India, are increasingly motivated to return to their home countries due to rapid economic growth, increasing living standards, and increasing opportunities in their home country. The reverse migration of the foreign-born professionals and academics leaves developed countries with a lack of intellectual capital. This may lead to economic drawbacks in developed countries and diminishing opportunities for native-born professionals. Statistics show that more than 52% of Silicon Valley's startups during the recent tech boom were started by foreign-born entrepreneurs. In addition, the "foreign-national researchers have contributed to more than 25% of our global patents… foreign-born workers comprise almost a quarter of all the U.S. science and engineering workforce and 47% of science and engineering workers who have PhDs."&lt;ref name="smartplanet.com"/&gt;  Furthermore, 54% of engineering doctorates went to foreign students, who returned to their home country after graduation, which disheartens the executives of research and development in the developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Eryn &amp; Kirkpatrick, David. (2002). The reverse brain drain. Fortune. 146(9):39-40. [http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=1&amp;hid=111&amp;sid=ed19af90-593c-4313-a789-34c9aa4c014d%40sessionmgr110&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=buh&amp;AN=7697804]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anarchism sidebar}}
The '''Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Революційна Повстанська Армія України}}), also known as the '''Black Army''' or simply as '''Makhnovshchyna''' ({{lang-uk | Махновщина}}), was an [[anarchist]] army formed largely of Ukrainian peasants and workers&lt;ref&gt;
The Black Army, an anarchist force, also had large numbers of Jewish members in its ranks.
&lt;/ref&gt;
under the command of the famous anarchist [[Nestor Makhno]] during the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917&amp;ndash;1922. They protected the operation of "free [[Soviet (council)|soviets]]" and [[libertarian socialism|libertarian]] [[Commune (socialism)|communes]] in the [[Free Territory]], an attempt to form a [[Stateless society|stateless]] [[anarcho-communist]] society from 1918 to 1921 during the [[Ukrainian War of Independence|Ukrainian Revolution]].

==History==
[[File:Tachanka in Huliaipole Museum.jpg|thumb|left|290px|''Tachanka'' used by Black Army soldiers at the [[Huliaipole]] museum.]]

===Nestor Makhno and the Insurrectionary Anarchist Army===
Ukrainian anarchist guerrilla bands were active during the [[Russian Civil War]]. Some claimed to be loyal to the Ukrainian state, but others acknowledged no allegiance; all fought both the Red and [[White movement|White Armies]] with equal ferocity in the opening stages of the Civil War. Of all the anarchist groups, the most famous and successful was that of the peasant anarchist leader Nestor Makhno, aka ''Batko'' ("Father"), who began operations in the southeastern [[Ukraine]] against the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]] regime in July 1918. In September, he formed the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, or Anarchist Black Army, with arms and equipment largely obtained from retreating [[Austro-Hungarian]] and German forces. During the Civil War, the Black Army numbered between 15,000 and 110,000 men&lt;ref&gt;Le Banquet des Généraux, ''Anarchy's Cossacks'' [http://www.banquetdesgeneraux.com/article2.html Article]: Armed forces of all types in the Black Army varied over the course of the war. Frequently, large numbers of potential anarchist soldiers were ready for duty, but Moscow refused to supply rifles and equipment for them.&lt;/ref&gt; and was organized on conventional lines, with infantry, cavalry, and artillery units; artillery batteries were attached to each infantry brigade. Makhno's cavalry incorporated both regular and irregular (guerrilla) horse-mounted  forces, and was considered among the best-trained and most capable of any of the cavalry units deployed by any side in the Russian Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Le Banquet des Généraux, ''Anarchy's Cossacks''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Bolshevik]] government and [[Red Army]] commanders often referred to the Black Army as "Makhnovist forces", because they pointedly declined to accord the Ukrainian anarchists the status of having an army or a legitimate political movement. [[Volin]] described the Insurrectionary Black Army of the time (less its cavalry, which normally ranged far afield) as follows: The infantry, when it was not fighting, led the march of the army ... [The Black Army also used horse-drawn carts or] ''[[tachanka]]s''. Each of these vehicles, which were drawn by two horses, carried the driver on the front seat and two soldiers behind them. In some sections a machine-gun was installed on the seat between them. The artillery brought up the rear. A huge black flag floated over the first carriage. The slogans ''Liberty or Death'' and ''The Land to the Peasants, the Factories to the Workers'' were embroidered in silver on its two sides.&lt;ref&gt;Eikhenbaum, Vsevolod M. (Volin), ''The Unknown Revolution, 1917-1921: Book III: Struggle for the Real Social Revolution, Part II: Ukraine (1918-1921)'', Free Life Editions (1974), {{ISBN|0-914156-07-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-914156-07-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A main obstacle to the anarchist army, and one which it never overcame throughout its existence, was a lack of access to primary industrial manufacturing resources, specifically factories capable of producing large amounts of arms and ammunition. Denied large-scale arms shipments from the Bolshevik government in Moscow, and without arsenal manufacturing centers of its own, the Black Army was forced to rely on captures of munition depots and supplies from enemy forces, and to procure food and horses from the local civilian population.

===Red Army mutinies in Ukraine===
By May 1919, the Bolshevik government had withdrawn most Red Army forces from Ukraine after [[Battle of the Donbass and Don (1919)|White successes in the south]]. The remaining Red Army troops who had stayed in various parts of Ukraine were suspicious of their commanders, and angry at the withdrawals from Ukraine, which they considered a defection from the revolutionary cause. At the end of July, 1919, Red Army detachments numbering some 40,000 troops in [[Crimea]] mutinied and deposed their commanders; many set out to join Makhno's anarchist Black Army. The mutiny was organized by some of Makhno's anarchist comrades who had remained commanders in the ranks of the Red Army, including Kalashnikov, Dermendzhi, and Budanov; these men also planned the transfer of forces. Large numbers of Red Army soldiers advanced from [[Novi Bug]] to [[Pomoshchnaya]] in search of Makhno's Black Army, bringing with them, as captives, their former commanders: Kochergin, Dybets and others. The mutineers joined Black Army forces at [[Dobrovelychkivka]] in the municipality of [[Kherson]] at the beginning of August 1919. For the Bolshevik government in Moscow, this defection was a major blow; since almost nothing remained of the Red Army in southern Ukraine and the Crimea, Bolshevik influence in the area vanished.&lt;ref name="Arshinov, Peter 1923"&gt;Arshinov, Peter, ''History of the Makhnovist Movement (1918-1921)'', Chapter 7, (1923)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign against Denikin and the White Army===
Makhno and the Ukrainian anarchist Black Army, at first declared 'bandits' and 'outlaws' by the Moscow's Bolshevik government, were welcomed after General [[Anton Denikin]] threatened to overrun Moscow in a drive towards the city in 1919. After concluding an agreement with the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Ukrainian Directory]], Makhno and his subordinate commanders made plans to turn the Black Army east and attack Denikin's [[Volunteer Army]] and its lines of supply, hoping to break through his lines.&lt;ref name="Arshinov, Peter 1923"/&gt; 
 
The Black Army had been retreating to the west across Ukraine. But on the evening of September 25, 1919, it suddenly turned east, attacking the main forces of General Denikin's army. The first encounter took place late in the evening near the village of Kruten'koe, where the Black Army's First Infantry Brigade advanced towards White Army positions. Denikin's troops retreated to take up better positions. At first, Denikin believed the move was a feint or reconnaissance-in-force, and did not follow up, concluding that most of the anarchist army was still retiring to the west. However, in the middle of the night, all of Makhno's troops began an offensive to the east.  The White Army's principal forces in the area were concentrated near the village of Peregonovka; the village itself was occupied by anarchist units. An [[Battle of Peregonovka (1919)|intense battle]] broke out, and the occupying anarchist forces began to lose ground, pressured by White Army reinforcements, including infantry regiments composed largely of young and fanatically anti-communist officers.  Makhno's headquarters staff, as well as everyone in the village who could handle a rifle, armed themselves and joined in the fighting.  On the approach of Makhno's cavalry forces, White Army troops retreated from Peregonovka. A fierce battle took place outside the town, including instances of hand-to-hand combat. A White regiment was forced to retreat, at first slowly and in an orderly way, but as the fighting moved near the Sinyukha river, it became a rout. The other regiments, seized by panic, followed them.  Finally all of Denikin's troops in the area were routed; most escaped by swimming across the Sinyukha River, but hundreds died in the river and on its banks.&lt;ref name="Arshinov, Peter 1923"/&gt;

After this victory, Makhno's troops set out to attack Denikin's lines of supply. The fall of Aleksandrovsk to the Black Army was followed by [[Polohy|Pologi]], [[Huliaipole|Gulyai-Polye]], [[Berdiansk|Berdyansk]], [[Melitopol]]', and [[Mariupol]]'. In less than two weeks, all of southern Ukraine had been conquered by Black Army troops. Makhno's occupation of southern Ukraine, especially the regions bordering on the [[Sea of Azov]], soon posed a threat to Denikin's entire offensive, as the supply base of Denikin's army was located in the region between Mariupol' and [[Volnovakha]]. When Berdyansk and Mariupol' were taken, immense stores of munitions were captured by anarchist forces. Because all the railroads of the region were controlled by the Black Army, no war material could reach Denikin's forces on the northern front. White Army reserve regiments stationed throughout the region were ordered to break the blockade, but were instead routed.&lt;ref name="Arshinov, Peter 1923"/&gt; 
 
[[File:Grupo de Combate del Ejército Negro.JPG|thumb|right|320px|Black Army combat group, headed by Fedir Shchus (center)]]

After a failed attempt to dislodge Black Army forces, Denikin shifted his campaign from the north to the south. The White Army's best cavalry troops, commanded by General [[Konstantin Mamontov]] and General [[Shkuro]], were transferred from the northern front to the [[Huliaipole|Gulyai-Polye]] region of [[Novorossiya]]. Denikin's new strategy succeeded in driving out Makhno's forces from part of Ukraine, but at the cost of denuding forces opposing the Red Army. During October and November 1919, Denikin's troops were defeated in a series of battles by Red Army forces. His Caucasus regiments suffered the greatest losses, especially the Chechen cavalry and others, who died by the thousands. Towards the end of November, some of these troops mutinied, returning to their homes in the Caucasus. This in turn began a slow disintegration of Denikin's Volunteer Army. Some historians note that if the anarchist forces had not won a decisive victory at Peregonovka, blockading Denikin's lines of supply and denying the White Army supplies of food, ammunition, and artillery reinforcements, the White Army would probably have entered Moscow in December 1919.&lt;ref name="Arshinov, Peter 1923"/&gt; All through February, 1920 the [[Free Territory]]—[[Makhnovist]] region—was inundated with Red troops, including the [[42nd Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|42nd Rifle Division]] and the [[Latvian Riflemen|Latvian]] &amp; [[Estonian Red Riflemen|Estonian Red Division]] – in total at least 20,000 soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[[V. N. Litvinov]], An Unsolved Mystery - The "Diary of Makhno's Wife".&lt;/ref&gt; After the souring and dissolution of Nestor Makhno's Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine with Bolsheviks the captured Red commanders and commissars were similarly summarily executed. However, Makhno usually preferred to release the disarmed enlisted men that were captured, as "proletarian brothers", with a choice of joining his army or returning home, after all commanding officers were executed. This happened to an Estonian Red Army unit that surrendered to Makhno in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeenglish.ru/ArticlesMakhno.htm Nestor Makhno Biography.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Viktor Belash]] noted that even in the worst time for the revolutionary army, namely at the beginning of 1920, "In the majority of cases rank-and-file Red Army soldiers were set free". Of course Belash, as a colleague of Makhno's, was likely to idealize the punishment policies of the Batko. However, the facts bear witness that Makhno really did release "in all four directions" captured Red Army soldiers. This is what happened at the beginning of February 1920, when the insurgents disarmed the 10,000-strong Estonian Division in [[Huliaipole]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Buysky]], "The Red Army on the Internal Front", Gosizdat (1927), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; To this it must be added that the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine included a choir of Estonian musicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1920/military/ch73.htm How Is Makhno’s Troop Organised?]&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was further compounded by the alienation of the Estonians by [[Anton Denikin]]'s Russian nationalist view of [[Little Russia|Malorossiya]] and their refusal to fight with [[Nikolai Yudenich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-866753/Why-did-the-Bolsheviks-win.html|title=Why did the Bolsheviks win the Russian Civil War?

===First repudiation of the alliance===
After the victories over the White Army, the Bolshevik government repudiated its alliance with Makhno and the Ukrainian anarchist movement, repeatedly attacking concentrations of Black Army troops, as well as ordering Chekist and Red Army reprisals against those believed sympathetic to the anarchists.  In June 1920 the [[Cheka]] sent two agents to assassinate Makhno—one recruited from Ukrainian ''[[naletchiki]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Naletchiki'' was a common term for apolitical armed bandits that roamed lawless areas of Russia before and during the Civil War.&lt;/ref&gt; another a double agent who had previously worked for Makhno. However, the latter disclosed his mission before it could be carried out, and both were executed.  Meanwhile, Red Army forces, vastly superior in numbers and equipment, steadily reduced areas of Russia under anarchist control.&lt;ref name="Avrich, Paul 1968 pp. 296-306"&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Russian Anarchists and the Civil War'', Russian Review, Vol. 27, No. 3 (July 1968), pp. 296-306&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1920, [[Leon Trotsky]] (as War Commissar of the Red Army) had resorted to terror tactics, ordering the death of thousands of Ukrainian villagers and peasants loyal to Makhno's Black Army.  Trotsky also intentionally withdrew Red Army troops from their positions on the southern front, allowing Tsarist Cossack forces to overrun the southern Ukraine. At first, Makhno and the Black Army retreated, followed by a caravan of Ukrainian refugees.  Attacking again, Makhno's forces surprised General [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel]]'s counterrevolutionary regiments in southern Ukraine, capturing 4,000 prisoners and stores of weapons and munitions, and preventing Wrangel from seizing that year's [[grain]] harvest in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Berland, Pierre, ''Mhakno'', Le Temps, 28 August 1934: In addition to supplying White Army forces and their sympathizers with food, a successful seizure of the 1920 Ukrainian grain harvest would have had a devastating effect on food supplies to Bolshevik-held cities, while depriving both Red Army and Ukrainian Black Army troops of their usual bread rations.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bolshevik-Makhnovist Treaty of Political and Military Alliance===
Trotsky once again offered an alliance, sending a plenipotentiary delegation from the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Communist Party, headed by Comrade Ivanov to propose a military and political treaty of alliance; Makhno agreed, subject to a pardon of all Anarchist prisoners throughout Russia.&lt;ref name="Avrich, Paul 1968 pp. 296-306"/&gt;  The treaty was drawn up and signed on October 15, 1920 at Starobel'sk by anarchist military and political representatives and the Bolshevik Communist delegation.&lt;ref name="Arshinov, Peter 1921"&gt;Arshinov, Peter, ''History of the Makhnovist Movement (1918-1921)'', Chapter 9, (1923)&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty, along with a Makhnovist delegation then traveled to the Bolshevik-held city of [[Kharkiv]] for official ratification and to plan a common military strategy.  Using the arms and munitions previously captured from General Wrangel's infantry brigades in the southern Ukraine, Makhno and the Black Army went on to clear much of Crimea of Cossack cavalry, and helped force a retreat of Wrangel's remaining infantry brigades. After an [[Northern Taurida Operation|unsuccessful northern offensive]] against the Red Army, Wrangel and the last of his forces were [[Evacuation of the Crimea (1920)|evacuated from Sevastopol]] by the White and French Navy on November 14, 1920.

However, the Bolshevik Communist government in Moscow initially refused to publish the Bolshevik-Makhnovist Treaty or acknowledge the existence of a formal alliance outside Ukraine. It also continued to denounce anarchism as an illegitimate political movement elsewhere in Russia, accelerating mass arrests and detentions of anarchists in all areas of the country under Bolshevik and Red Army control. After pressure by Makhno, the Central Committee in Moscow eventually published the military section of the Bolshevik-Makhnovist treaty, followed a week later by the political section.  A fourth clause concerning the establishment of autonomous committees composed of workers and peasants for self-government of areas held by the Black Army was omitted.&lt;ref name="Arshinov, Peter 1921"/&gt;

===Second repudiation===
On November 26, 1920 The Bolshevik sent 5 regular Armies numbering more than 350,000 with armoured cars, artillery,aircraft, and armoured trains, with the purpose of destroying the Makhnovist movement. The Makhnovist army barely numbered 10,000 men continued to fight on making raids all across Ukraine and Southern Russia fighting constant battles with much larger and better equipped Red  army units. In August 1921 the Makhnovist army ceased to be an organised force, numbering only 1,200-2,000 men scattered across Ukraine. A badly wounded Makhno with 77 of his men crossed the Dniester river to Romania in August 28, 1921. The last Makhnovist forces were destroyed in late 1922.

}}
In mid-1919, the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine had a strength of some 15,000 men, organised into one [[cavalry]] and four [[infantry]] [[Brigade]]s, a [[machine gun]] [[regiment]] with 5000 [[gun]]s, and an [[artillery]] [[detachment (military)|detachment]]. At its peak in December 1919, it had about 83,000 infantry, 20,135 cavalry, 1,435 machine guns, and 118 guns, as well as seven [[armored train]]s and some [[Armored car (military)|armored car]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Belash, Victor &amp; Belash, Aleksandr, ''Dorogi Nestora Makhno'', p. 340&lt;/ref&gt;     It was organized into four Corps and the strategic reserve. Each Corps had one infantry and one cavalry Brigade; each Brigade had 3-4 Regiments of the appropriate type.&lt;ref&gt;Belash, Victor &amp; Belash, Aleksandr, ''Dorogi Nestora Makhno'', pp. 333 &amp; 340&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of the RIAU was not that of a traditional army.  Instead, the RIAU was a democratic militia based on soldier committees and general assemblies.  Officers in the ordinary sense were abolished; instead, all commanders were elected and recallable. Regular mass assemblies were held to discuss policy.  The army was based on self-discipline, and all of the army’s disciplinary rules were approved by soldier assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Arshinov. "The Makhnovist Movement." Gods, No Masters: An Anthology of Anarchismno, edited by Daniel Gurin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Anarchist FAQ "5 How were the Makhnovists organised?" http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/append46.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

This organizational structure was later used in organizing militias created by anarchists in the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish revolution]] and [[Spanish Civil War]].

There is historical debate about whether the RIAU was an entirely voluntary militia or whether it relied on [[conscription]]. Paul Avrich argues that voluntary mobilisation was in reality conscription.&lt;ref name="avrich1988"&gt;Avrich, Paul. [[Anarchist Portraits]], 1988 Princeton University Press, pg 121&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians have disagreed. Michael Malet points to surviving RIAU leaflets from 1920 which are appeals to join, not orders.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Malet. Nestor Makhno in the Russian Civil War, page 105&lt;/ref&gt; After long debate, a regional congress in the Ukraine [[Free Territory]] decided to reject conscription and instead use moral persuasion. In other words, "compulsory mobilization" was rejected in favor of "obligatory mobilization", which meant that each able bodied man should recognize his obligation to join the RIAU.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Palij. [[The Anarchism of Nestor Makhno, 1918–1921]]; page 155&lt;/ref&gt; Leon Trotsky also declared that the RIAU was a voluntary militia, and seeing as Trotsky commanded the Red Army that eventually defeated the RIAU, he had no reason to lie in their favor. In Trotsky's words, "Makhno does not have general mobilisations, and indeed these would be impossible, as he lacks the necessary apparatus."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in: Michael Malet. Nestor Makhno in the Russian Civil War, page 106&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36187">The '''right of return''' is a principle in [[international law]] which guarantees everyone's right of [[voluntary return]] to or re-enter their [[country of origin]] or of [[citizenship]]. A right of return based on nationality, citizenship or ancestry may be enshrined in a country's constitution or law, and some countries deny a right of return in particular cases or in general.

The right is formulated in several modern treaties and conventions, most notably in the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the 1966 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the 1948 [[Fourth Geneva Convention]]. The [[Geneva Conventions]], it has been argued, have passed into [[customary international law]] and that the right of return is binding on non-signatories to the conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/icty/icty.html|title=United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law|website=legal.un.org|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right of return is often invoked by representatives of [[refugee]] groups to assert that they have a right to return to the country from which they were displaced.

== History ==
The right to leave one's country and return to it are regarded as [[human right]]s and based in [[natural law]].&lt;ref name="ingles"&gt;J.D. Inglés (1963), ''Study of Discrimination in Respect of the Right of Everyone to Leave any Country, Including His Own, and to Return to His Country'', Geneva, UN, UN Sales no. 64.XIV.2, UN Doc E/CN.4/Sub.2/220/Rev.1&lt;/ref&gt;  In antiquity, the right to return was connected by philosophers with the right of travel.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

===Ancient precedents===
There are various recorded cases in ancient history where people who had been deported or uprooted from their city or homeland were allowed (or encouraged) to return, typically when the balance of military and political forces which caused their exile had changed. However, in these cases the exiled populations were granted the ''option'' to return, it was never recognized that they had an inherent ''right'' to return.

A well-known example is the [[return to Zion]], which King [[Cyrus the Great]] granted the [[Jew]]s expelled from [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] to the [[Babylonian Exile]] to return to their ancestral homeland and rebuild [[Jerusalem]]. Recorded in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Book of Ezra]] and [[Book of Nehemiah]]) this case is often cited as a precedent by modern [[Zionist]]s and also inspired other groups seeking to pursue their own return.

During the [[Peloponnesian War]], [[Athens]] expelled and scattered the inhabitants of [[Melos]], [[Aegina]] and other cities (some of them being sold into slavery). Following the victory of [[Sparta]], the Spartan general [[Lysander]] in 405 BC made a concerted effort to gather these exiles and restore them to their original cities.&lt;ref name=Xenophon229&gt;Xenophon. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0206%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D9 ''Hellenica'', 2.2.9]: "Meantime Lysander, upon reaching Aegina, restored the state to the Aeginetans, gathering together as many of them as he could, and he did the same thing for the Melians also and for all the others who had been deprived of their native states."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Plutarch144&gt;Plutarch. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0048%3Achapter%3D14%3Asection%3D3 ''Life of Lysander'', 14.3]: "But there were other measures of Lysander upon which all the Greeks looked with pleasure, when, for instance, the Aeginetans, after a long time, received back their own city, and when the Melians and Scionaeans were restored to their homes by him, after the Athenians had been driven out and had delivered back the cities."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magna Carta===
The first codified law guaranteeing a Right of Return can be found in the Magna Carta:&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Megan: "Liberal Democracies' Divergent Interpretations of the Right of Return: Implications for Free Movement", ''Democratic Citizenship and the Free Movement of People'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
:In future it shall be lawful for any man to leave and return to our kingdom unharmed and without fear, by land or water, preserving his allegiance to us, except in time of war, for some short period, for the common benefit of the realm. People that have been imprisoned or outlawed in accordance with the law of the land, people from a country that is at war with us, and merchants - who shall be dealt with as stated above - are excepted from this provision.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item95692.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Constitution of 1791===
Another early example of [[national law]] recognizing the Right of Return was the French constitution of 1791, enacted on 15 December 1790:&lt;ref name="ingles"/&gt; 
:the freedom of everyone to go, to stay, or to leave, without being halted or arrested unless in accordance with procedures established by the Constitution.

The constitution put an end to the centuries-long persecution and discrimination of [[Huguenot]]s (French [[Protestant]]s).{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Concurrently with making all [[Protestant]]s resident in France into full-fledged citizens, the law enacted on December 15, 1790  stated that: 
:All persons born in a foreign country and descending in any degree of a French man or woman expatriated for religious reason are declared French nationals (''naturels français'') and will benefit to rights attached to that quality if they come back to France, establish their domicile there and take the civic oath.&lt;ref&gt;André Encrevé, French Protestants, in Rainer Liedtke, Stephan Wendehorst, eds., ''Emancipation of Catholic Jews: Minorities and the Nation-State in Nineteenth-Century Europe'', Manchester University Press, 1999, p.66&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] and expulsion of the Huguenots had taken place more than a century earlier, and there were extensive Huguenot diasporas in many countries, where they often intermarried with the population of the host country (see [[Edict of Potsdam]]). Therefore, the law potentially conferred French citizenship on numerous Britons, Germans, South Africans and others – though only a fraction actually took advantage of it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} This option for Huguenot descendants to gain French citizenship remained open until 1945, when it was abolished - since after the [[Occupation of France]], the French were unwilling to let Germans of Huguenot origin take advantage of it.

===Schleswig plebiscites, 1920===

In the aftermath of the [[Second Schleswig War]] of 1864, the previously Danish-ruled territory of [[Schleswig]] became part of [[Imperial Germany]]. A significant number of inhabitants, known as "[[wiktionary:optant|optant]]s", chose to retain their Danish citizenship and refused to take up a German one. Consequently, they were expelled from the area by Prussian authorities. Half a century later, following the German defeat in the [[First World War]], a [[Schleswig plebiscites, 1920| plebiscite]] was held in 1920 to determine the future of the area. The Danish government asked the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] to let these expelled ethnic Danes and their descendants return to Schleswig and take part in the plebiscite. This was granted, though many of the optants had in the meantime emigrated to the United States, and most of these did not actually come back.

==Legal understanding of the right==
The right of return principle has been codified in a number of international instruments, including:

[[Hague Regulations]] (HR), article 20:

:20. After the conclusion of peace, the [[repatriation]] of [[prisoners of war]] shall be carried out as quickly as possible.

It has been argued that if the HR require the repatriation of prisoners, then it is "obvious" that civilians displaced during conflict must also be allowed to repatriate.&lt;ref name="badil-brief"&gt;Boling, Gail J. [https://www.badil.org/phocadownload/Badil_docs/bulletins-and-briefs/Brief-No.8.pdf Palestinian Refugees and the Right of Return: An International Law Analysis], ''BADIL - Information &amp; Discussion Brief Issue No. 8'', January 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), article 13:

:1. Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State.
:2. Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.

[[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) article 12(4):

:4. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country.

[[Fourth Geneva Convention]], article 49:

:49. Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.

:Nevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. ... Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.

[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], article 5d(ii):

:The right to leave any country, including one's own, and to return to one's country.

Some controversy exists among scholars on how these articles should be interpreted.

==="His own country"===
There is some disagreement&lt;ref name="bracka"&gt;Bracka, Jeremie Maurice. [http://law.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/1681169/Bracka.pdf Past  the Point of no Return? The Palestinian Right of Return in International Human Rights Law], ''Melbourne Journal of International Law'', Melbourne, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; as to what "his own" and "his country" means in the ICCPR and UDHR. According to the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]]'s authoritative interpretation:

:The scope of "his own country" is broader than the concept "country of his nationality". It is not limited to nationality in a formal sense, that is, nationality acquired at birth or by conferral; it embraces, at the very least, an individual who, because of his or her special ties to or claims in relation to a given country, cannot be considered to be a mere alien.  This would be the case, for example, of nationals of a country who have been stripped of their nationality in violation of international law, and of individuals whose country of nationality has been incorporated in or transferred to another national entity, whose nationality is being denied them. 
and
:The right of a person to enter his or her own country recognizes the special relationship of a person to that country... It includes not only the right to return after having left one’s own country; it may also entitle a person to come to the country for the first time if he or she was born outside the country.&lt;ref name="hrc27"&gt;UN Human Rights Committee (HRC), ''[http://www.refworld.org/docid/45139c394.html HRC in General Comment 27 CCPR General Comment No. 27: Article 12 (Freedom of Movement)]'', 2 November 1999, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.9&lt;/ref&gt;

The landmark [[Nottebohm case]] of 1955 is often cited as staking out more criteria as to what "ones country" should be.&lt;ref name="bracka"/&gt; Among  them were "a close and enduring connection", "tradition",
"establishment", "interests" and "family ties".

Refugees who are [[third country resettlement|resettled]] into third countries lose [[Refugee#Refugee status|refugee status]] and acquire a new nationality. They therefore lose the right to return to their country of origin.

===Mass displacement===
Some disagreement exists on whether the right of return is applicable to situations in which whole ethnic groups have been displaced or not. [[Ruth Lapidoth]] from the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]] has argued, by citing [[Stig Jägerskiöld]] from his 1966 commentary of ICCPR, that the right was not intended to protect groups of displaced people:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... [it] is intended to apply to individuals asserting an individual right. There was no intention here to address the claims of masses of people who have been displaced as a by-product of war or by political transfers of territory or population, such as the relocation of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe during and after the Second World War, the flight of the Palestinians from what became Israel, or the movement of Jews from the Arab countries.&lt;ref name="JCPA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp485.htm |title=Legal Aspects of the Palestinian Refugee Question |author=Ruth Lapidoth |publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]] |date=September 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hurst Hannum]] has made a similar argument:

:There is no evidence that mass movements of groups such as refugees or displaced persons were to be intended to be included within the scope of article 12 of the Covenant by its drafters.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst Hannum, ''The Right to Leave and Return in International Law and Practice'', p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manfred Nowak]] has argued the opposite position, that the right of return applies "even if masses of people are claiming this right" &lt;ref&gt;Manfred Nowak, ''U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: CCPR Commentary'', p.220, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Bracka has argued similarly:

:At any rate, what seems clear is that neither the text nor the [[travaux préparatoires]] of the relevant UDHR, ICCPR and CERD provisions actually support circumscribing [the right of] return in this way [to exclude situations of mass displacement]. Firstly, there is no indication that the drafters considered the applicability of the freedom of movement principle to members of displaced populations. And although it may have been assumed at the time that such a scenario would receive discussion in ‘some other body of law’, this is not synonymous with an intention to limit these articles to isolated individuals. Secondly, nowhere in the actual text is the operation of the right of return qualified on the basis of group affiliation. Rather, in each instance, the relevant language refers to ‘everyone’. In addition, the HRC in General Comment 27 affirms this reading in so far as it states: ‘[t]he right to return is of the utmost importance for refugees seeking voluntary repatriation. It also implies prohibition of enforced population transfers or mass expulsions to other countries’. Thirdly, whilst the right of return in art 12(4) of the ICCPR is presented as an individual right, [[John Quigley (academic)|Quigley]] confirms that ‘this is also true of most rights in international human rights instruments’. Indeed, the movement of people has historically taken on a collective dimension. Accordingly, to deny the availability of human rights simply because individuals form part of a mass group would render those rights illusory.&lt;ref name="bracka"/&gt;

==Right of return in case law==
Few cases have dealt with the right of return principle. In 1996, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ruled in a landmark case known as ''[[Loizidou v Turkey]]''. Mrs [[Titina Loizidou]] was a [[Greek-Cypriot]] refugee displaced from [[Northern Cyprus]] and prevented from returning by [[Turkey]]. The court ruled that Turkey had violated Mrs Loizidou's human rights, that she should be allowed to return to her home and that Turkey should pay damages to her.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Milano, ''Unlawful territorial situations in international law'', p.143&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar case, petitioners for the [[Chagossians]] asked the ECHR in 2005 to rule about their removal from [[Diego Garcia]] by [[Great Britain]] in the 1960s. The court ruled in 2012 that their case was inadmissible and that by accepting compensation, the islanders had forfeited their claim:

:The Court notably found that the heart of the applicants’ claims under the European Convention on Human Rights was the callous and shameful treatment which they or their antecedents had suffered during their removal from the Chagos islands. These claims had, however, been raised in the domestic courts and settled, definitively. In accepting and receiving compensation, the applicants had effectively renounced bringing any further claims to determine whether the expulsion and exclusion from their homes had been unlawful and breached their rights and they therefore could no longer claim to be victims of a violation of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf/?library=ECHR&amp;id=003-4207010-4992253&amp;filename=003-4207010-4992253.pdf Chagos islanders’ case inadmissible because they accepted compensation and waived the right to bring any further claims before the UK national courts]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-state groups claiming a right of return ==
===Circassians===
Circassians are an indigenous ethnic group originating from the northwestern [[Caucasus]]. Throughout the 19th century, the [[Russian Empire]] adopted a policy to [[Circassian genocide|eradicate Circassians]] from their ancestral homelands, pushing most surviving Circassians into the diaspora.&lt;ref name=wiley&gt;Wiley, Mason. [http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1837&amp;context=auilr Circassian Right of Return: “Putin The Terrible or Putin The Enlightened?]. American University Washington College of Law 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Circassians have expressed an interest in returning to Circassia, particularly [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Circassians fleeing]] the [[Syrian Civil War|conflict in Syria]].&lt;ref name=wiley/&gt;

=== Georgian refugees and internally displaced persons ===
{{Main|Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia}}
During [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|Abkhazia's war of secession]] in 1992-1993  and the [[War in Abkhazia (1998)|second Abkhazia  war]] in 1998, 200,000-250,000 Georgian civilians became internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees. Abkhazia, while formally agreeing to repatriation, has hindered the return of refugees both officially and unofficially for more than fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory F. Treverton, ''Dividing Divided States'', p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greek-Cypriots ===
During the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], 40% of the Greek-Cypriot population as well as over half of the Turk-Cypriot population of the island were displaced. The island was divided along ethnic lines and most of the Greek-Cypriot displaced persons were not allowed to return to their homes in the northern Turk-Cypriot side and vice versa.

Plans for a solution of the conflict has centered around bilateral agreements of [[population exchange]], such as the [[Third Vienna Agreement]] reached in 1975 or the proposed [[Annan Plan for Cyprus|Annan Plan]] of 2004. In these plans, the right of return was to be severely limited with respect to Greek-Cypriot internally displaced persons/refugees to districts such as  [[Kyrenia]], [[Morphou]], [[Famagusta]], and parts of [[Nicosia]], despite judgements of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in cases such as [[Loizidou v. Turkey]], and numerous UN resolutions recognizing the right of return (such as [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 361|SC 361]] and [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3212|GA 3212]]). Two [[Cypriot Annan Plan referendums, 2004|referendums]] on the Annan Plan were held in April 2004, separately along ethnic lines. The Annan Plan was overwhelmingly rejected in the [[Greek Cypriots|Greek-Cypriot]] referendum.

The right of return continues to remain a stumbling block to the settlement of the [[Cyprus problem]].

=== Diego Garcia Chagossians ===
The [[Chagossians]], an ethnic group residing on the island of [[Diego Garcia]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], were expelled to [[Mauritius]] in the 1960s, in connection with the erection of an [[United States|American]] strategic military installation on the island. Ever since, the Chagossians have been conducting a persistent political and legal struggle to return to Diego Garcia. As of 2007, their right to return was recognised by several British courts but the [[UK]] government failed to actually implement it (see [[Chagossians]], [[Depopulation of Diego Garcia]], [[Order in Council#United Kingdom]]).

=== Palestinians ===
{{Main|Palestinian right of return}}
[[Palestinian refugee]]s argue that international law guarantees them a right to return to their former homes in [[Mandatory Palestine]] and a right to property they left behind in what is now [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=lawand&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawand|first=Kathleen|title=The Right to Return of Palestinians in International Law|journal=International Journal of Refugee Law|year=1996|volume=8|issue=4|pages=532–568|doi=10.1093/ijrl/8.4.532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel's Defense Minister, [[Avigdor Lieberman]], was reported as saying in June 2017 that his government will not allow any Palestinians to settle in the lands claimed by them and currently part of Israeli territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =O'Connor | first =Tom | coauthors = | title =Israel Will Not Accept A Single Palestinian To Old Borders, Says Defense Minister | work = | pages = | language =English | publisher =Newsweek | date =23 June 2017 | url =http://www.newsweek.com/israel-not-accept-single-palestinian-old-borders-defense-628786 | accessdate = 24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Countries with laws conferring a right of return ==
=== Armenia ===
Article 14 of the [[Constitution of the Republic of Armenia]] (1995) provides that "[i]ndividuals of Armenian origin shall acquire citizenship of the Republic of Armenia through a simplified procedure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/am00000_.html|title=ICL - Armenia - Constitution|publisher=|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provision is consistent with the ''Declaration on Independence of Armenia'', issued by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Armenia in 1989, which declared at article 4 that "Armenians living abroad are entitled to the citizenship of the Republic of Armenia".

=== Estonia ===
Article 36 (3) of the [[Constitution of Estonia]] states that "Every [[Estonians|Estonian]] is entitled to settle in [[Estonia]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/530102013003/consolide/current|title=The Constitution of the Republic of Estonia – Riigi Teataja|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
In October 1985, [[President of France|French President]] [[François Mitterrand]] issued a public apology to the descendants of [[Huguenots]] around the world. A right of return to France was ensured for Huguenot descendants all around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discours.vie-publique.fr/notices/857015500.html |title=Allocution de M. François Mitterrand, Président de la République, aux cérémonies du tricentenaire de la Révocation de l'Edit de Nantes, sur la tolérance en matière politique et religieuse et l'histoire du protestantisme en France, Paris, Palais de l'UNESCO, vendredi 11 octobre 1985. - vie-publique.fr |publisher=Discours.vie-publique.fr |date=1985-10-11 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
{{see also|German Citizenship Project}}
[[Germany|German]] law allows (1) persons descending from German nationals of any ethnicity or (2) persons of ethnic German descent and living in countries of the former [[Warsaw Pact]] (as well as Yugoslavia) the right to "return" to Germany and ("re")claim German citizenship (Aussiedler/Spätaussiedler "late emigrants"). After legislative changes in late 1992 this right is de facto restricted to ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union. As with many legal implementations of the Right of Return, the "return" to Germany of individuals who may never have lived in Germany based on their ethnic origin or their descent from German nationals has been controversial. The law is codified in paragraph 1 of Article 116 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]], which provides access to German citizenship for anyone "who has been admitted to the territory of the German Reich within the boundaries of December 31, 1937 as a refugee or expellee of German ethnic origin or as the spouse or descendant of such person".&lt;ref name="Germany Basic Law"&gt;[https://www.bundestag.de/blob/284870/ce0d03414872b427e57fccb703634dcd/basic_law-data.pdf Basic Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075359/https://www.bundestag.de/blob/284870/ce0d03414872b427e57fccb703634dcd/basic_law-data.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those territories had [[Poles in Germany|a Polish minority]], which also had German citizenship and [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|after World War II lived in Poland]]. These Polish people are also ''Aussiedler'' or ''Spätaussiedler'' and came [[History of Poland (1945–1989)#End of Communist rule (1980–1990)|especially in the 1980s]] to Germany, see [[Emigration from Poland to Germany after World War II]]. For example [[Lukas Podolski]] and [[Eugen Polanski]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expolis.de/schlesien/texte/simonides.html|title=GIBT ES EIN OBERSCHLESISCHES ETHNIKUM?|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; became German citizens by this law. Paragraph 2 of Article 116 also provides that "Former German citizens who between 30 January 1933 and 8 May 1945 were deprived of their citizenship on political, racial or religious grounds, and their descendants, shall on application have their citizenship restored".&lt;ref name="Germany Basic Law"/&gt;

The historic context for Article 116 was the eviction, following [[World War II]], of an estimated 9 million foreign ethnic Germans from other countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Another 9 million German nationals[[historical eastern Germany|former eastern German territories]], over which [[Joseph Stalin]] and eastern neighbour states extended military hegemony in 1945, were [[expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]] as well. These expellees and refugees, known as ''[[Heimatvertriebene]]'', were given refugee status and documents, and - as to foreign ethnic Germans - also the German citizenship (in 1949), and resettled in Germany. The [[Federation of Expellees|Discussion of possible compensation]] continues; this, however, has been countered by possible claims for war compensation from Germany's eastern neighbours, pertaining to both Germany's unconditional surrender and the series of population transfers carried out under the instruments of [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]].

=== Ghana ===
Ghana grants an indefinite right to stay in Ghana to members of the [[African diaspora]] with African ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theafricareport.com/West-Africa/ghana-a-place-for-african-americans-to-resettle.html |title=Ghana, a place for African-Americans to resettle |last=Dovi |first=Efam |date=11 May 2015 |website=[[The Africa Report]] |publisher= |access-date=16 July 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greece ===
Various phenomena throughout Greek history (the extensive colonization by classical Greek city states, the vast expansion of Greek culture in Hellenistic times, the large dominions at times held by the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire, and the energetic trading activity by Greeks under the Ottomans) all tended to create Greek communities far beyond the boundaries of modern Greece.

Recognizing this situation, Greece grants citizenship to broad categories of people of ethnic Greek ancestry who are members of the Greek diaspora, including individuals and families whose ancestors have been resident in diaspora communities outside the modern state of Greece for centuries or millennia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://athens.usembassy.gov/uploads/7z/Z4/7zZ4A6EyE4dMjph5dNxFew/citizenship_code.pdf US Embassy in Athens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705222308/http://athens.usembassy.gov/uploads/7z/Z4/7zZ4A6EyE4dMjph5dNxFew/citizenship_code.pdf |date=2008-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Foreign persons of Greek origin", who neither live in Greece nor hold Greek citizenship nor were necessarily born there, may become Greek citizens by enlisting in Greece's military forces, under article 4 of the ''Code of Greek Citizenship'', as amended by the  ''Acquisition of Greek Nationality by Aliens of Greek Origin Law'' (Law 2130/1993).  Anyone wishing to do so must present a number of documents, including "[a]vailable written records ... proving the Greek origin of the interested person and his ancestors."

[[Albania]] has demanded since the 1940s that Greece grant a Right of Return to the Muslim [[Cham Albanians]], who were [[Expulsion of Cham Albanians|expelled]] from the Greek region of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] between 1944 and 1945, at the end of [[World War II]] – a demand firmly rejected by the Greeks (see [[Cham issue]]).

=== Hungary ===
In 2010, Hungary passed a law granting citizenship and the right of return to descendants of Hungarians living mostly on the former territory of the Hungarian Kingdom and now residing in Hungary's neighbouring countries. [[Slovakia]], which has 500,000 ethnic Magyar citizens (10% of its population) objected vociferously.&lt;ref name="Pandora's Passport 2010, p. 60"&gt;Pandora's Passport, Hungary extends citizenship beyond its borders, Slovakia retaliates," The Economist, June 5, 2010, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israel ===
{{Main article|Law of Return}}
The [[Law of Return]] is legislation enacted by [[Israel]] in 1950, that gives all [[Jews]], persons of Jewish ancestry up to at least one Jewish grandparent, and spouses of Jews the right to [[Aliyah|immigrate]] to and settle in Israel and obtain citizenship, and obliges the Israeli government to facilitate their immigration. Originally, the law applied to Jews only, until a 1970 amendment stated that the rights "are also vested in a child and a grandchild of a Jew, the spouse of a Jew, the spouse of a child of a Jew and the spouse of a grandchild of a Jew". This resulted in several hundreds of thousands of persons fitting the above criteria immigrating to Israel (mainly from the [[former Soviet Union]]) but not being recognized as Jews by the Israeli religious authorities, which on the basis of [[halakha]] recognize only the child of a Jewish mother as being Jewish, or a [[proselyte]] to Judaism. Moreover, some of these immigrants, though having a Jewish grandparent, are known to be practicing Christians. People who would be otherwise eligible for this law can be excluded if they can reasonably be considered to constitute a danger to the welfare of the state, have a criminal past, or are wanted fugitives in their countries with the exception of persecution victims. Jews who converted to another religion can also be denied the right of return. Since its inception in 1948, over three million Jews have immigrated to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3539874,00.html |title=400 olim arrive in Israel ahead of Independence Day - Israel Jewish Scene, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date= |accessdate=2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lithuania ===
From the Constitution of Lithuania, Article 32(4): "Every Lithuanian person may settle in Lithuania."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/lh00000_.html|title=ICL - Lithuania - Constitution|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===
{{See also|Polish nationality law#Loss of Polish citizenship}}
From the Constitution of [[Poland]], Article 52(5): "Anyone whose Polish origin has been confirmed in accordance with statute may settle permanently in Poland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/pl00000_.html|title=ICL - Poland - Constitution|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portugal ===
On April 12, 2013, the Portuguese parliament  unanimously approved a measure that allows the descendants of [[Jews expelled from Portugal]] in the 16th century to become [[Portuguese citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/descendants-of-jews-who-fled-persecution-may-claim-portuguese-citizenship|title=Descendants of Jews who fled persecution may claim Portuguese citizenship|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spain ===
[[Sephardi Jews]] were expelled from Spain in 1492. Despite the requirement by general rule for obtaining Spanish nationality after five years of residence in Spain, by Royal Decree on the 20th of December 1924, Sephardi Jews can obtain Spanish nationality with two years of residence in Spain. From 1924 until 2015 Sephardi Jews living abroad could also ask the Spanish Government for a conferment of Spanish nationality, but the Government enjoyed full discretion as to the decision whether to grant Spanish nationality. On June 24, 2015, the Spanish Parliament approved the 12/2015 Act, the Law Granting the Nationality to Sephardi Jews, that grants the Spanish nationality automatically to Sephardi Jews living abroad, provided they can prove that they are descendants of the Sephardi Jews expelled in 1492.

In 2007, the Spanish Parliament approved the 57/2007 Act, the Law of Historical Memory. The 57/2007 Act provides for the descendants of Spaniards living abroad that left Spain because of political persecution during the Civil War and Franco's dictatorship &amp;mdash; that is the period between 1936-1975 &amp;mdash; to obtain Spanish nationality.

Finally, following the British conquest of Gibraltar in August 1704, the original Spanish population of Gibraltar was expelled and established in the surrounding area called "Campo de Gibraltar". The expelled population established the Gibraltarian institutions, the census and the archives in the City of San Roque, which officially is still "Gibraltar in exile". Despite claims to the right of return by the association of descendants of expelled Gibraltarians, neither the Spanish Government nor the British Government have recognised any right of return for the expelled Gibraltarians.

The name originated from a remark made by conservative commentator, [[Rush Limbaugh]], who called [[Georgetown University]] law student [[Sandra Fluke]] a "[[slut]]" after she testified in favor of [[Birth control|contraceptives]] at a Congressional hearing in February, 2012.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/rock-slut-vote-site-aims-fight-women-issues-november-election-article-1.1090276|title=‘Rock the Slut Vote’ site aims to fight for women’s issues in November election  - NY Daily News|last=DUERSON|first=MEENA HART|work=nydailynews.com|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews with journalists, Emry states that "she chose to brand the site with the derogatory term in an effort to take it back and turn it into a rallying cry"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and that she had not previously been politically engaged.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2012/04/30/rock-the-slut-vote-mobilizes-for-liberals/|title=Rock The Slut Vote mobilizes for liberals|website=dailycaller.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emry was inspired by an article in [[HuffPost|Huffington Post]] written by Morra Aarons-Mele entitled "Getting Out the Slut Vote in 2012."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The stated mission of the campaign "is to fight the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] effort to bully, subjugate and silence women. We will wrest the power from the word slut and help women get informed, get involved, get registered and vote."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2012/06/website-vows-to-rock-the-what-076989|title=Website vows to rock the -- what?!|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/christine-bronstein/rock-your-slut-vote-and-o_b_1882926.html|title=Rock Your Slut Vote and Other Tips From My Interview With Kimberley Johnson|last=Bronstein|first=Christine|date=2012-09-18|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graphic used by the campaign is a lipstick mark representing a full kiss. The campaign created a website in 2012 that offered assistance in registering to vote and provided templates for people to use to contact their representatives with a focus on rights to reproductive health care.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/05/07/will-the-slut-vote-matter-in-2012/|title=Will the ‘Slut’ Vote Matter in 2012?|last=Cooney|first=Katherine|work=Time|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign also launched a Facebook page in 2012.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The founder of the campaign and owner of the trademark, Emry, and another spokesperson, Kimberley A. Johnson, report receiving criticism about the name of the campaign from both left and right.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Emry states that some of the harshest criticisms have come from the political right.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Activist-hopes-sluts-rock-the-vote/36851338902845/|title=Activist hopes 'sluts' rock the vote|work=UPI|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emry also wrote a book a short book entitled ''Rock the Slut Vote: American Edition: Navigating the Republican War on Women'' illustrated by Candace Foy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McMillan, Susan; and Candace Foy. (2012). ''Rock the Slut Vote: Navigating the Republican War on Women''. San Luis Obispo, CA: RTSV United.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published in 2012 with a foreword by [[Feminism|feminist]] [[Satire|satirist]] Soraya Chemaly. A [[HuffPost|Huffington Post]] article notes that profits from the book go to [[Planned Parenthood]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; an international organization that provides education and reproductive health services.  

Emry, the founder of the site and the holder of the registered trademark, was born in 1956. She has two children and lives in [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]], California.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Roosevelt Campobello International Park''' preserves the house and surrounding landscape of the summer retreat of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and their family. It is located on the southern tip of [[Campobello Island]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[New Brunswick]], and is connected to the mainland by the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Bridge|Roosevelt Memorial Bridge]], at [[Lubec, Maine]] in the United States.  Here in August 1921, 39-year-old Roosevelt, who would go on to become the 32nd [[President of the United States]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|fell ill]] and was diagnosed with [[poliomyelitis|polio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=September 16, 1921 |title=F. D.

After her death in 1962, the family deeded the property to the governments of the U.S. and Canada. In 1964, they created the {{convert|2800|acre|km2|adj=on}} International Park.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen O. Muskie, ''Campobello: Roosevelt’s Beloved Island'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The cottage, built in the [[Shingle style architecture|Shingle Style]] and completed in 1897, was designed by [[Willard T.

==Description==
Roosevelt Campobello International Park has a visitor centre with a gift shop and a small bilingual display on the open [[Canada–United States border]].&lt;ref name="clui"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clui.org/section/united-divide-a-linear-portrait-usacanada-border-0 |title=Chapter 1: Eastern Maine |website=United Divide: A Linear Portrait of the USA/Canada Border |publisher=The Center for Land Use Interpretation |publication-date=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative history==
The park is owned and administered by the Roosevelt Campobello International Park Commission, created by international treaty signed by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Georges Vanier]], [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Lester B. Pearson]], and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on January 22, 1964.  The park was established on July 7, 1964.  Both countries provide financial support to the park.  It is an affiliated area of [[Parks Canada]] and of the U.S. [[National Park Service]].

Charter members of the board of the international commission included U.S. Senator [[Edmund S. Muskie]], [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr.]], and Lubec, Maine, resident [[Sumner T. Pike]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abacus.bates.edu/Library/aboutladd/departments/special/ajcr/1975/Campobello%20Island.shtml Two articles] by Donald R.

'''Roxarsone''' is an [[organoarsenic compound]] that has been used in [[poultry production]] as a feed additive to increase weight gain and improve [[feed conversion ratio|feed efficiency]], and as a [[coccidiostat]].&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;{{cite news | author = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | url = http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ProductSafetyInformation/ucm258313.htm | title = Questions and Answers Regarding 3-Nitro (Roxarsone) | date = June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2011, it was approved for chicken feed in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and 12 other countries.&lt;ref name="NYT2011"&gt;{{cite web | last=Harris | first=Gardiner | last2=Grady | first2=Denise | title=Pfizer Suspends Sales of Chicken Drug | website=The New York Times | date=9 June 2011 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/09/business/09arsenic.html | access-date=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug was also approved in the United States and elsewhere for use in [[Swine production|pigs]].&lt;ref name=FDA /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT2011"/&gt;

==Production and applications==
Roxarsone is a derivative of [[phenylarsonic acid]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;As(O)(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). It was first reported in a 1923 British patent that described the [[nitration]] and [[diazotization]] of [[arsanilic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;GB 226255 19230718&lt;/ref&gt; When blended with calcite powder, it is used in poultry feed premixes in some parts of the world. Where available, it can be purchased in 5%, 20% and 50% concentrations.

Roxarsone was marketed as '''3-Nitro''' by [[Zoetis]], a former subsidiary of [[Pfizer]] now a publicly traded company. In 2006, approximately one million kilograms of roxarsone were produced in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Hileman, B. | url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/government/85/8515gov2.html | title = Arsenic in Chicken Production | publisher = [[Chemical and Engineering News]] | date = April 9, 2007 | pages = 34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing approval in the United States==
Roxarsone is one of four [[arsenical]] animal drugs that had been approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for use in poultry and/or swine, along with [[nitarsone]], [[arsanilic acid]], and [[carbarsone]].&lt;ref name=FDA /&gt; In September 2013, the FDA announced that [[Zoetis]] and [[Fleming Laboratories]] would voluntarily withdraw current roxarsone, [[arsanilic acid]], and [[carbarsone]] approvals, leaving only [[nitarsone]] approvals in place.&lt;ref name="withdrawn"&gt;{{cite news | author = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | url = http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ProductSafetyInformation/ucm370568.htm | title = FDA Response to Citizen Petition on Arsenic-based Animal Drugs | date = September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 FDA withdrew the approval of using nitarsone in animal feeds. The ban came into effect at the end of 2015.&lt;ref name="nitarsone"&gt;{{cite news | author = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | url =http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/CVMUpdates/ucm440668.htm | title =FDA Announces Pending Withdrawal of Approval of Nitarsone | date = April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Schleswig-Holstein Question''' ({{lang-de|Schleswig-Holsteinische Frage}}; {{lang-da|Spørgsmålet om Sønderjylland og Holsten}}) was a complex set of diplomatic and other issues arising in the 19th century from the relations of two duchies, [[Schleswig]] ({{lang-da|Sønderjylland/Slesvig}}) and [[Duchy of Holstein|Holstein]] ({{lang-da|Holsten}}), to the [[Denmark|Danish]] crown and to the [[German Confederation]].  The British statesman [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] is reported to have said: “Only three people have ever really understood the Schleswig-Holstein business—the [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Consort]], who is dead—a German professor, who has gone mad—and I, who have forgotten all about it."&lt;ref&gt;Lytton Strachey, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1265 Queen Victoria]'', 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schleswig was a part of [[Denmark]] during the [[Viking Age]], and became a Danish [[duchy]] in the 12th century. [[Denmark]] repeatedly tried to reintegrate the Duchy of [[Schleswig]] into the Danish kingdom. On March 27, 1848, [[Frederick VII of Denmark]] announced to the people of Schleswig the [[promulgation]] of a liberal constitution under which the duchy, while preserving its local autonomy, would become an integral part of Denmark. This led to an open uprising by [[Schleswig-Holstein]]'s large German majority in support of independence from Denmark and of close association with the [[German Confederation]]. The military intervention of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] supported the uprising: the [[Prussian army]] drove Denmark's troops from Schleswig and Holstein, beginning the [[First Schleswig War]] (1848–51), which ended in a Danish victory at [[Battle of Isted|Idstedt]]. The second attempt to reintegrate the Duchy of Schleswig into the Danish kingdom, initiated by the signing by King [[Christian IX of Denmark|Christian IX]] of [[Denmark]] of the [[History of Schleswig-Holstein#The November Constitution|November Constitution]] in 1863, was seen as a violation of the [[London Protocol (1852)|London Protocol]] and led to the [[Second Schleswig War]] of 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Keith A.P. Sandiford, ''Great Britain and the Schleswig-Holstein question, 1848-64: a study in diplomacy, politics, and public opinion'' (University of Toronto Press, 1975).
&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Schleswig, Holstein, and Denmark had all had the same hereditary ruler for some centuries, the inheritance rules in the three territories were not the same. The Dukedoms of Schleswig and Holstein were inherited under the [[Salic law]] which ignored females: the Kingdom of Denmark had a different inheritance law which permitted male heirs to inherit through the female line. In the 19th century, this difference in inheritance law meant that when the childless King [[Frederick VII of Denmark]] died, the Kingdom of Denmark would be separated from the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, because one man would inherit the Kingship and another the Dukedoms. This is what happened on the death of Frederick VII in 1863.

The central question was whether the duchy of Schleswig was or was not an integral part of the dominions of the Danish crown, with which it had been associated in the Danish monarchy for centuries or whether Schleswig should, together with Holstein, become an independent part of the [[German Confederation]]. Schleswig itself was a [[fief]]dom of Denmark, as the duchy of Holstein had been a fief of the Holy Roman Empire until 1806, and become a component state of the German Confederation with the Danish king as duke. This involved the question, [[Frederick VII of Denmark#Succession crisis|raised by the death of the last common male heir to both Denmark and the two duchies]], as to the proper succession in the duchies, and the [[History of Schleswig-Holstein#The November Constitution|constitutional questions]] arising out of the relations of the duchies to the Danish crown, to each other, and of Holstein to the German Confederation.

Much of the [[history of Schleswig-Holstein]] has a bearing on this question. Following the defeat of Germany in [[World War I]], the Danish majority area of Northern Schleswig was finally unified with Denmark after two [[Schleswig Plebiscites|plebiscites]] organised by the Allied powers. A small [[North Schleswig Germans|minority of ethnic Germans]] still lives in [[North Schleswig|Northern Schleswig]], while a [[Danish minority in Southern Schleswig|Danish minority]] remains in [[South Schleswig]].

== Constitutional problem ==
Since 1849 disparate systems of government had co-existed within the Danish state. Denmark proper had become a [[constitutional democracy]]. However, [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] was still the system of Schleswig and Holstein, with advisory assemblies based on the estates system which gave more power to the most affluent members of society. The three units were governed by one cabinet, consisting of liberal ministers of Denmark who urged economic and social reforms, and conservative ministers from the Holstein nobility who opposed political reform. After the uprising in Holstein and Schleswig the monarch had no interest in sharing rule with the people, many formerly rebellious. [[Estates of the realm]], with their fear of being replaced by democratic institutions, were easier to be compromised. 

This caused a deadlock for practical lawmaking, hardened by ethnic tensions, and a complete inability to govern was imminent. Moreover, Danish opponents of this so-called Unitary State (''Helstaten'') feared that Holstein's presence in the government and, at the same time, Holstein's membership of the German Confederation would lead to increased German interference with Holstein, or even into purely Danish affairs.

In Copenhagen, the palace and most of the administration supported a strict adherence to the status quo. The same applied to foreign powers such as Great Britain, France and Russia, who would not accept a weakened Denmark in favour of a German power, such as Austria or Prussia, acquiring Holstein with the important naval harbour of [[Kiel]] or controlling the entrance to the Baltic.

==Language and nationality==
[[File:Folkesprogene i Hertugdømmet Slesvig.png|thumb|right|[[Language shift]] in the 19th century in Southern Schleswig.]]
There was also the national question: both Germany and Denmark wished, characteristically of the nineteenth century, to create and consolidate nationalities from a background of fragmented cultural practices and dialects.

Lastly, there was the international question: the rival ambitions of the German powers involved, and beyond them the interests of other European states, notably that of the United Kingdom in preventing the rise of a German sea-power in the north.

German had been the language of government in [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]] while more-or-less independent Dukes ruled, and stayed so; and had been a language of government of the kingdom of Denmark in several eras. Since the Lutheran [[Reformation in Denmark-Norway and Holstein|Reformation]], German had been dominant in church and schools, and Danish was the dominant language among the peasantry in Schleswig.

[[Low German]] was the language of all of Holstein. During the centuries following the [[Middle Ages]], Low German had come to dominate in Southern Schleswig, which had originally been predominantly Danish-speaking. The Danish language still dominated in Northern Schleswig. Around 1800, German and Danish were spoken in approximately equal proportions throughout what is now Central Schleswig.

The German language had been slowly spreading at the expense of Danish in previous centuries: for example, Danish was still spoken on the peninsula of [[Schwansen]] around 1780 (the last known use of Danish was in the villages near the Schlei), but then became extinct.

The language border in the nineteenth century conformed approximately to the current border between Denmark and Germany {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}.

It was clear that Danish dominance in Schleswig was vulnerable and weakening. Through its vigorous economic activity, the ethnically German area to the south expanded its geographic domain. Linguistically [[Low German]] immigrants constantly arrived, and previously Danish-speaking families often came to find it convenient to change languages. The Low German language, rather than Danish, had become typical of Holstein and much of south Schleswig.

One solution, which afterwards had the support of [[Napoleon III]], would have been to partition Schleswig on the lines of nationality, assigning the Danish part to Denmark, the German to Holstein. This idea, which afterwards had supporters among both Danes and Germans, proved impracticable at the time owing to the intractable disposition of the majority on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;''La Question de Slesvig'', p. 135 seq., ''Historique de l'idée d'un partage du Slesvig''&lt;/ref&gt; This solution was subsequently implemented by plebiscites in 1920 as a condition of the [[treaty of Versailles]], and [[Northern Schleswig]] was returned to Denmark.
[[File:Londonkonferencen Grænseforslag.png|thumb|Schleswig / Slesvig Partition Plans 1864]]

==Treaty of Ribe==
German Schleswig-Holsteiners often cited a clause from the [[Treaty of Ribe]] of 1460, stating that Schleswig and Holstein should "always be together and never partitioned (''or'' separated)". Although this treaty played a minor role at the more formal level of the conflict, its proclamation "Forever Inseparable" (''Up ewig ungedeelt'') obtained proverbial status during the German nationalist awakening, both among those wishing an independent Schleswig-Holstein, and in the [[Unification of Germany|German unification]] movement in general.

In Denmark it was granted less significance, and the citing widely regarded to be out of context, as it could either hint at the duchies not being separated from each other, or their not being partitioned into smaller shares of inheritance. This had happened many times anyway, leaving a confusing pattern of feudal units. Danes also brought forward rulings of a Danish clerical court and a German Emperor, of 1424 and 1421 respectively, stating that Schleswig rightfully belonged to Denmark, because it was a Danish [[fief]] and Holstein was a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, wanting Schleswig and Holstein to separate from each other.

The major powers appear to have given the Treaty of Ribe little notice in comparison to the ethnic conflict and worries about the European balance of power.

==Resolution==
[[File:German Empire - Prussia - Schleswig Holstein (1871).svg|thumb|right|The Province of Schleswig–Holstein (red), within the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], within the [[German Empire]], 1866–1920.]]
The [[Second Schleswig War]] resolved the Schleswig–Holstein Question violently, by forcing the king of Denmark to renounce (on 1 August 1864) all his rights in the duchies in favour of Emperor [[Franz Joseph&amp;nbsp;I of Austria]] and King [[William I, German Emperor|William&amp;nbsp;I of Prussia]]. By Article XIX of the definitive [[Treaty of Vienna (1864)|Treaty of Vienna]] signed on October 30, 1864, a period of six years was allowed during which the inhabitants of the duchies might opt for Danish nationality and transfer themselves and their goods to Denmark; and the rights pertaining to birth in the provinces were guaranteed to all, whether in the kingdom or the duchies, who had been entitled to those rights at the time of the exchange of ratifications of the treaty.

In the [[Austro–Prussian War]] of 1866, Prussia took Holstein from Austria and the two duchies subsequently merged into the [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein]]. From this point on, the Schleswig-Holstein Question was subsumed by the larger issue of Austro–Prussian relations, which the 1866 war deeply influenced. It survived, however, as between Danes and Germans, though narrowed to the question of the fate of the Danish population of Schleswig. This question is of great interest to students of international law and as illustrating the practical problems involved in asserting the modern principle of [[nationality]].

For the effect on the Danes of Schleswig and events afterwards, see [[History of Schleswig-Holstein#Danes under German rule|History of Schleswig-Holstein]].

Today, Northern Schleswig, or [[South Jutland County]], is in [[Denmark]]; the remainder, as [[Schleswig-Holstein]] is a [[States of Germany|state of Germany]].

==Schleswig-Holstein Question in literature==
Elements of the Schleswig-Holstein Question were fictionalised in ''[[Royal Flash]]'', the second of [[George MacDonald Fraser]]'s ''[[The Flashman Papers]]'' novels.

Its potential solution (or lack thereof) also forms part of the solution to the mystery at the centre of [[Kim Newman]]'s short story "Tomorrow Town".

Danish author [[Herman Bang]] wrote of life on the island of [[Als Island|Als]] in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Dybbøl]] in the [[Second War of Schleswig]] in his novel ''Tine'', published in 1889.

[[Dostoevsky]] refers to this as "The farce in Schleswig-Holstein" in ''[[Notes from Underground]]''.

The question appears in the first volume of the ''Reminiscences'' of [[Carl Schurz]]&lt;ref&gt;Carl Schurz, ''Reminiscences'' (3 vols.), New York: McClure Publ. Co., 1907&lt;/ref&gt; as an issue of concern in the [[Revolutions of 1848]] and also as the farcical recollections of his friend [[Adolf Strodtmann]] regarding his (Strodtmann's) participation in the conflict (see Chapter 5, pp.&amp;nbsp;130&amp;ndash;132, and Chapter 6, pp.&amp;nbsp;141&amp;ndash;143).

The idea of '''sexual script''' brings a new metaphor and imagery for understanding [[human sexual activity]] as social and learned interactions. The concept was introduced by sociologists [[John H. Gagnon]] and [[William Simon (sociologist)|William Simon]] in their 1973 book ''Sexual Conduct''. The idea highlights three levels of scripting: cultural/historical, social/interactive and personal/[[intrapsychic]]. It draws from a range of theories including [[symbolic interactionism]], discourse theory and [[feminism]].&lt;!-- It is the foundation of the new Critical Sexualities Studies and the reshaping of the field of sexualities studies in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century.--&gt; The theory of sexual scripting brings sociological, cultural, anthropological, historical and social psychological tools to the study of human sexualities. Whereas human sexuality is usually seen as the province of the biologist and the clinician, scripting helps research and analysis to understand sexualities as less biological and more cultural, historical and social.

== Sexual script ==
Sexual scripting suggests the importance of meanings and symbols in human sexuality. According to Gagnon and Simon, scripts can be layered through three dimensions: 'cultural scenarios', 'interpersonal scenarios', and 'intrapsychic scenarios'. Sexual feeling does not simply happen from within the body, but needs meanings and symbols which provide cues and clues to enable sexualities to develop. Cultural scenarios are linked to different historical periods and social change; scripts can be shown to change with the arrival of [[HIV/AIDS]] in the 1980s, for example (Epstein, Lauman ...). Interpersonal scenarios are linked to encounters and interactions (for example in rape, as illustrated in the early work of [[Stevi Jackson]]). And intra-psychic scenarios indicate the ways in which personal sexual 'turn ons' and imageries grow.&lt;!-- (cf [[William Simon (sociologist)|William Simon]]'s)--&gt; Sexual scripts can be seen as providing guidelines for appropriate sexual behaviour and sexual encounters, as sexual behaviour and encounters are learned through culture and others in interactions. It can be linked to theories of [[sexual desire]] but is critical of the tendency to stress the purely biological aspects of desire.

== Developments==
Drawing upon [[conversational analysis]],&lt;!--Frith and Kitzinger,--&gt; sexual encounters are considered to be scripted if the parties involved use any of these five linguistic devices:&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Frith, Celia Kitzinger, Reformulating Sexual Script Theory. Theory and Psychology, 11 (2). pp.&amp;nbsp;209–232. Sass, November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on sexual scripts and sexual script theory have concluded that sexual scripts are organised through gender, class, ethnicity and other social vectors.

Sexual script theory and its application in clinical practice are founded on the undeniable reality that the subjective understandings of each person about his or her sexuality (and called a sexual script) substantively determine that person's choice of sexual actions and the subsequent qualitative experiencing of those sexual acts. Scripts refer to social functions. They dictate what one should be doing at a particular time and in a particular place if one is to play the role characteristically associated with that script. There may be several people involved in the same situation, but they may differ in the roles that they have been given or have chosen to enact. Script theory is a form of social scripting theory which has been defined clearly by Michael W. Wiederman who says, "Social scripting theory points to the fact that much of sexual behavior seems to follow a script. Similar to scripts that stage actors use to guide their behavior, social scripts instruct members of a society as to appropriate behavior and the meanings to attach to certain behaviors."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Michael Wiederman, The Gendered Nature of Sexual Scripts. The Family Journal, Vol. 13, No. 4, 496-502. Sage Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Social scripting theory directly relates to sexual scripts as it is just a specified example regarding sexual encounters and sexual behavior in social context. [[Social theory]] is also a useful resource in determining the construction of social scripts.

== Social constructionism ==
The theory is linked to the wider development of [[social constructionism]] on the socially created nature of social life.&lt;!-- See the social construction of sexuality.--&gt; Social construction is important to sexual script because sexual scripts can come from how a child is raised through the beliefs of social construction.&lt;ref&gt;Social Construction of Gender. http://employees.oneonta.edu/farberas/ARTH/ARTH200/gender.html&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, women are to be subjected to [[male gaze]] in order to be a part of the social construction system and maintain social norms of a long living society.

== Sexuality ==
Sexuality is the behavior of human beings with regard to the activities that causes or is associated with sexual arousal. It is influenced by the genetically inherited sexual response patterns, societal attitudes toward sex, and each individual's upbringing. "Physiology sets only very broad limits on human sexuality; most of the enormous variation found among humans results from learning and conditioning. What is deviant in one society may be normal in another. Sexuality covers gender identity, sexual orientation, and actual practices, as well as one's acceptance of these aspects of one's personality, which may be more important than their specifics."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/reproductive-health]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual norms ==
A [[sexual norm]] can be an individual or a social norm, which is a rule that is socially enforced. Norms affect a wide variety of human behavior.
Social norms regarding sexuality are present in most cultures. For example, the norm in most cultures consists of heterosexual acts between married individuals. Sexual norms are constantly changing and normal sexual behavior is a spectrum and cannot be rigidly defined. 
Deviance from normal sexual behavior is common and can be classified in several ways. If non-restrictive sexual norms are regarded positively they may be called "sexual freedom", "sexual liberation", or "free love". If regarded negatively they may be called "sexual license" or "licentiousness". Restrictive behavior when judged negatively is called "sexual oppression"; if judged positively they are called "chastity", "sexual restraint", The Maritial Effect, or "sexual decency".{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
In the West, sexual normality can be defined as any sexual practice which does not involve sexual perversions. There has been a liberalization in attitudes which has resulted in the legalization of homosexuality in many countries. There is a tendency in Western countries toward serial monogamy as a normal heterosexual lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton L. Jones, Heather R. Hostler, Sexual Script Theory: An Integrative Exploration of the Possibilities and Limits of Sexual Self-Definition. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologists believe that emotion emerges in relation to dominant sexual scripts and [[sexual identity]]. Sexual script is also believed to have different scripts for males and females in relation to sexual activity. In sexual script's link to sexual activity; sexuality, sexual norms, social construction and gender roles all play a part in what makes sexual script differ between males and females.

== Gender script ==
{{Main|Gender Script}}
[[Gender schema theory]] also plays a part in sexual script because studies show that males and females interact in different ways, even from a young age. In 1991, Martha Boston and Gary Levy found that through their research observations, children, primarily boys, were better with being able to sequence own-sex rather than other-sex scripts.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Levy, Martha Boston, Preschoolers' Recall of Own-Sex and Other-Sex Gender Scripts.

From an early age men are often raised to embrace their sexuality while women are usually brought up to suppress it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fahs|first=Breanne|date=2010|title=Daddy's Little Girls: On the Perils of Chastity Clubs, Purity Balls, and Ritualized Abstinence|url=|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=31 |issue=3|pages=116|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomically, boys have the benefit (or curse) of genitals that are more easily viewed and handled by their owners. The young boy is taught to hold onto his penis to urinate and to handle it for purposes of washing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Conversely, the young girl is not taught to touch her clitoris. She is taught to wipe care- fully after urination so as not to contract an infection by transferring bacteria from her rectum to her vagina. The end result? Boys and girls are given two subtly different sets of messages regarding their own genitals. Boys readily discover that their genitals feel good when handled and are not necessarily any “dirtier” than other parts of their body that they can see.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Girls readily learn that their genitals are difficult, if not impossible, for them to see and that there are “dirty” aspects that require appropriate precautionary measures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, gender roles may encourage sexual exploration more for boys than for girls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A double standard exists in the traditional heterosexual sexual script. It endorses different sexual behavior for women and men, whereby women are expected to confine sexual behavior to the context of a committed relationship and men are expected to engage in sexual behavior in all kinds of relationships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Young adult men who have not realized that their female peers hold a different set of sexual scripts are often perplexed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At a time when young adults have finally gained a marked increase in privacy from family (such as going away to college or getting married), it often seems obvious to young men that sexual activity should “naturally” occur now that a major barrier has been overcome.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Females who take such a view run the risk of being labeled deviant. To be too sexually interested or aggressive, especially outside the context of an intimate relationship, implies masculinity, or desperation, or some other flaw.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ellen van Oost uses the concept of gender script "to illustrate the ways that the design of technological artifacts are affected by the gender assumptions held about their 'envisioned users.'" Drawing from Akrich's argument that, "like a film script, technical objects define a framework of action together with the actors and the space in which they are supposed to act,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Akrich |first=Madeleine |year=1992 |chapter=The de-scription of technical objects |editor1-last=Bijker |editor1-first=Wiebe E. |editor2-last=Law |editor2-first=John |title=Shaping technology/building society: Studies in sociotechnical change |publisher=The MIT Press |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; van Oost extends the script approach to include the gender aspects of technological innovation.&lt;!-- Oudshoorn and Pinch describe van Oost's approach as "[adopting] the views that technological innovation[, which] requires a renegotiation of gender relations and an articulation of performance of gender identities" (10).--&gt; van Oost looks at the ways electric shavers are gendered for men and women starting in the late 1920s, including the "cigar" model for men and the "lipstick model for women." van Oost also argues that the development of the electric razor systematically constructs a gender script of technological incompetence as feminine, and "inhibits the ability of women to see themselves as interested in technology and as technologically competent, whereas the genderscript of [electric razors "for men"] invites men to see themselves that way. In other words: [electric razors] not only [produce] razors but also gender."&lt;ref name=vanoost&gt;van Oost, Ellen.

{{History of Afghanistan}}
The '''Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan''' ('''TISA'''), also known as the '''Afghan Transitional Authority''', was the name of a temporary administration of [[Afghanistan]] put in place by the [[2002 loya jirga|loya jirga]] of June 2002. It succeeded the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]].

==Background==
Following the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan]], a U.N.-sponsored conference of a few Afghan leaders in [[Bonn]] led to the appointment of the [[Afghan Interim Administration]] under the chairmanship of [[Hamid Karzai]]. However, this Interim Administration, which was not broadly representative, was scheduled to last for only six months, before being replaced by a
Transitional Administration. The move to this second stage would require the convening of a traditional Afghan "grand assembly", called a [[Loya Jirga]]. This [[2002 loya jirga|Emergency Loya Jirga]] elected a new Head of State and appointed the Transitional Administration, which, in turn, would run the country for a maximum of two more years until a "fully representative government" could be elected through free and fair elections.&lt;ref name="eias"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Electing a head of state===
The most important thing the Loya Jirga had to do was to choose a president for the Transitional Administration who would lead the country until the official presidential elections in 2004. Initially there were two candidates who had declared to run: former president of Afghanistan and Northern Alliance leader [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] and the American-backed chairman of the [[Afghan Interim Administration]] [[Hamid Karzai]]. Karzai was also supported by [[Abdullah Abdullah]] and [[Mohammad Fahim]], two important leaders of the [[Northern Alliance]]. 
A third possible candidate was [[Zahir Shah]], former king of Afghanistan until 1973. He had spent years living in Rome but had returned to Afghanistan after the fall of the [[Taliban]] regime. Already at the [[Bonn Conference (Afghanistan)|Bonn Conference]] which installed the interim administration there was a group of supporters of Zahir Shah, called the Rome-group, who wanted to take the former king to take up the position of head of state.

Upon arrival in Kabul, more than 800 delegates signed a petition urging the nomination of Zahir Shah as Head of State, if only as a figurehead. In view of the speculation, which the petition aroused, [[United States]] and [[United Nations]] representatives pressed the former King to withdraw. The start of the Loya Jirga was delayed from 10 to 11 June because of "logistical and preparatory problems." On 10 June the American representative [[Zalmay Khalilzad]] gave a press conference in which he declared that Zahir Shah was not a candidate. The same day, in a press conference of Zahir Shah the former king confirmed this and said "I have no intention of restoring the monarchy. I am not a candidate for any position in the Loya Jirga."&lt;ref name="eias"/&gt; Hamid Karzai, who sat next to Zahir Shah at the press conference called Zahir Shah the "father of the nation" and thanked him for the "confidence His Majesty has put in me."&lt;ref name= "eias" /&gt; The next day former President [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] withdrew his candidacy for Head of State in favour of Hamid Karzai "for the sake of national unity"&lt;ref name= "eias" /&gt;

So it looked like Karzai would go into the race for head of government uncontested, but two other candidates emerged. To be on the ballot at the Loya Jirga a candidate had to submit 150 signatures for his candidacy. [[Glam Fareq Majidi]] gathered only 101 signatures, so he was disqualified as candidate. Former mujahedeen fighter, [[Mohammed Asef Mohsoni]] submitted a list with 1,050 names for Karzai and also Masooda Jalal, a woman doctor working with the World Food Programme, and Mahfoz Nadai, an Uzbek army officer, poet and a deputy government minister gathered enough signatures to be on the ballot.&lt;ref name="afghanland"&gt;

The election for president of the transitional administration was held by secret ballot on 13 June 2002 — with black-and-white photos of the candidates adjacent to their names. Hamid Karzai was chosen with an overwhelming majority of 83% and stayed in office as President.

On 18 June, the day that Karzai would present his cabinet to the Loya Jirga he told the loya jirga that he needed one more day to make his final list.

On 19 June, the last day of the Loya Jirga, Karzai announced to the Loya Jirga the names of 14 ministers of the future [[Afghan transitional administration]], including three Vice-Presidents. He also named a Chief Justice. 
"Do you accept this Cabinet," Karzai asked the loya jirga. After hands went up in support, he said, "All have accepted it and I am happy about it." This led to some controversy, since delegates stated that there had not been a proper vote and that the cabinet had not been democratically selected, but was the result of political negotiations parallel at the loya jirga.&lt;ref name="eias" /&gt;

All three posts of Vice-President Karzai named were given to commanders of the [[Northern Alliance]] though Karzai was careful to make sure none of the vice-presidents were from the same ethnic background. 
After the Loya Jirga there was some controversies about the government Karzai had named and several names were added to the list before the actual cabinet was sworn in on 24 June, to appease certain factions within Afghanistan. On 22 June Karzai presented the more cabinet members, making the total number of ministers 29. This cabinet was installed at 24 June 2002. But due to controversy around the post of Woman's Affairs Minister this point stayed vacant.
Before the end of June Karzai named a Stat adviser to the Women's Affairs Ministry and later also a formal Women's Affairs Minister. In these last days of June Karzai also added two more vice-presidents and another National Security Adviser.

===More Pashtun representation===
The interim government was for a great deal dominated by [[Tajik people|Tajik]] warlords from the [[Northern Alliance]], so the [[Pashtun people|Pasthun]] majority wanted the following transitional administration to be more representative. In the original administration 9 of the 29 ministers were of Pashtun ethnic origin, in the new administration there were 13 Pashtun ministers among the 30 ministers. The rest of the cabinet was made up of 7 Tajiks, 3 Uzbeks, 2 Hazaras, 2 non-Hazara Shi'ites, and 1 Turkmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3f52085b4.html|title=Refworld {{!}} Afghanistan: Information on situation of Hazaras in post-Taliban Afghanistan|last=Resource Information Center|first=United States Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services|date=|work=Refworld|access-date=2017-05-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925020439/http://www.refworld.org/docid/3f52085b4.html|archive-date=2013-09-25|dead-url=yes|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabinet of warlords===
The Pasthun element in the Transitional administration was stronger than in the interim administration and the loya jirga was meant in part to increase civilian influence in the government. However, in many ways Afghanistan’s military factions and warlords increased and further legitimized their power during the loya jirga. During and after the loya jirga, army and police officials threatened, imprisoned, and even killed candidates to stop them from running for the loya jirga, or to intimidate them from acting independently&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/afghanistan0703/7.htm|title=HRW: "Killing You is a Very Easy Thing For Us": Human Rights Abuses in Southeast Afghanistan: II. Background|last=Human Rights Watch|first=|date=|website=www.hrw.org|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Alliance still dominated the government. The three vice-presidents Karzai announced on the Loya Jirga, [[Karim Khalili|Khalili]], [[Abdul Qadir (Afghan leader)|Qadir]] and [[Mohammed Fahim|Fahim]] were all Northern Alliance commanders, although none of them had the same ethnic background. The powerful [[Tajik people|Tajik]] [[Jamiat-e Islami]] trio Fahim, [[Yunus Qanuni|Qanuni]] and [[Abdullah Abdullah|Abdullah]] kept important positions in the new cabinet.

The powerful warlord [[Ismail Khan]] was not part of the administration, but he was represented by his son, [[Mirwais Sadiq|Mir Wais Saddiq]]. However Saddiq was assassinated in 2004 while being in office as minister.
Another powerful warlord, the [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]] [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] was also not part of the cabinet, however there was one Uzbek more in the transitional administration than in the interim administration.

In the years after the government was put in place, President Karzai made some efforts to limit the worst effects of warlord dominance, for example by replacing the relatively weak Pashtun who led the ministry of Interior by the more reform-minded [[Ali Ahmad Jalali]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Adding royalists===
At the Loya Jirga Karzai named former King [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]] the Father of the Nation. However, some of the king's supporters thought that an honorary title wasn't enough for the king and they had rather seen him in an official position as president, with Karzai in a position as prime minister. Also, two of the Kings loyalist [[Hedayat Amin Arsala]] and [[Abdul Rassoul Amin]] had lost the position they had in the interim government. Because the members loyal to Zahir Shah, united in the 'Rome group' thought they had to less influence, Karzai added in end June [[Zalmay Rassoul]] as Security Adviser and Amin Arsala as a fifth vice-president.

===Western-schooled intellectuals===
Karzai was also under pressure to put some highly educated Afghans on the administration who had become refugees during the Communist rule or Taliban rule of Afghanistan and had been schooled by western universities. The most remarkable person Karzai put in his administration was [[Ashraf Ghani]], who worked at the World Bank, as Finance Minister. [[Juma Mohammedi]] who became Mines Minister was also a World Bank employee. The new Interior Minister, [[Taj Mohammad Wardak]], held American citizenship, as did Ali Ahmad Jalali, who replaced him as Interior Minister in January 2003.

===Opposition from Yunus Qanuni===
Because of this issue of Pashtun under representation, [[Yunus Qanuni]], one of the important Northern Alliance leaders, told the opening session he would be resigning as minister of the important post of [[Afghan ministry of the interior|interior]] so Karzai could strengthen the national government by broadening its ethnic mix. Yunus Qanuni, the former Interior minister, was unhappy with the post of Education Minister he had been assigned, since he had expected to become something like prime minister. Qanuni said he considered not joining the government at all. The rank-and-file Panjshiri troops who dominate the Interior Ministry temporarily blocked off the roads around the Interior Ministry complex in Kabul on 20 and 21 June and brandished weapons to demonstrate that their loyalties remain with Qanuni. They denied the New Interior Minister, the 80-year-old Taj Mohammad Wardak, access to the Interior ministry.&lt;ref name="eariana"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
After Karzai appointed Qanuni special adviser on security, through which he retained unofficial control over the Afghan intelligence apparatus and became de facto supervisor of Wardak, he decided to join the administration anyway, but he also formed a party outside of the government and run for president in the next elections.&lt;ref name="eias" /&gt;

===Women's affairs===
There was also controversy around the post of minister for woman's affairs: Interim Women's Affairs Minister Sima Samar had been very outspoken and she had been threatened and complaints against here were filed by the supreme court who eventually decided not to charge her with [[blasphemy]]. Because at the Loya Jirga Samar wasn't on the list there was initially no minister appointed for woman's affairs. Karzai later appointed Government [[Mahbuba Huquqmal]] as State Representative in the Women's Affairs Ministry and after that [[Habiba Sarabi]] as formal minister of Women's Affairs.

===The killing of Abdul Qadir===
The Pashtun vice-president was Abdul Qadir, one of the few Northern Alliance commanders of Pashtun ethnic origin. On July 6, 2002, Qadir and his son-in-law were killed by gunmen in a surprise attack with unknown motive. In 2004, one man was sentenced to death and two others to prison sentences for the killing.&lt;ref name=USDepStat&gt;

The '''White Eagles''' ({{lang-sr|Бели орлови}} / ''Beli orlovi''), also known as the '''Avengers''' (Осветници / ''Osvetnici''),&lt;ref name="ICTY: Milan Lukić and Sredoje Lukić judgement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/milan_lukic_sredoje_lukic/tjug/en/090720_j.pdf|title=ICTY: Milan Lukić and Sredoje Lukić judgement}}&lt;/ref&gt;  were a Serbian [[paramilitary]] group associated with the [[Serbian National Renewal]] (SNO) and the [[Serbian Radical Party]] (SRS).&lt;ref name="BBC-Seselj"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2317765.stm "Profile: Vojislav Seselj" ''BBC News'' 27 November 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;Allen, Beverly (1996) ''Rape Warfare: The Hidden Genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia'' University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, Minnesota, pp. 154-155, {{ISBN|0-8166-2818-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White Eagles fought in [[Croatian war|Croatia]] and [[Bosnian war|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] during the [[Yugoslav Wars]].&lt;ref name="BBC-Seselj"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt;

In the 2003 [[ICTY]] [[Vojislav Šešelj]] indictment, the group is included as an alleged party in the [[joint criminal enterprise]], in which Vojislav Šešelj allegedly took part. In the indictment the group is identified as "volunteer units including '[[Chetnik]]', or '''Šešeljevci''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Шешељевци}}, translated into English as 'Šešelj's men')".&lt;ref name=cis-seselj&gt;ICTY, [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/seselj/ind/en/ses-ii030115e.pdf Vojislav Seselj indictment], 15 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt; This association has been denied by SRS leader Vojislav Šešelj.&lt;ref&gt;"In previous wars (Bosnia, Croatia) there was a small paramilitary organisation called White Eagles, but the Serb Radical Party had absolutely nothing to do with them."[http://www.icty.org/x/cases/pavkovic/trans/en/050823IT.htm Testimony of Vojislav Šešelj, Transcript of 23 August 2005, p. 43081, lines 16-18]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
Although the group's members were occasionally referred to as [[Chetniks]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/~pols/ps17971/terneel/bassiouni.html United Nations Commission on Breaches of Geneva Law in Former Yugoslavia]&lt;/ref&gt; they are not to be confused with the Serbian anticommunist [[guerrilla]] group during and after World War II also known as the ''White Eagles'' and also referred to as ''Chetniks''. The name White Eagles comes from an anti-communist organisation that was formed during [[World War II]] and continued a guerrilla war against [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito's]] government after the war. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} White Eagle refers to the [[national symbol]] of [[Serbia]], the double headed white eagle under a crown.

==History==
The White Eagles paramilitary group was formed in late 1990 by [[Dragoslav Bokan]] and [[Mirko Jović]].

'''William Jennings Bryan''' (March 19, 1860 – July 26, 1925) was an American orator and politician from [[Nebraska]]. Beginning in 1896, he emerged as a dominant force in the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], standing three times as the party's nominee for [[President of the United States]]. He also served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and as the [[United States Secretary of State]] under [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Just before his death he gained national attention for attacking the teaching of evolution in the [[Scopes Trial]]. Because of his faith in the wisdom of the common people, he was often called "The Great Commoner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nimick|first=John|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1925/07/27/Great-Commoner-Bryan-dies-in-sleep-apoplexy-given-as-cause-of-death/4119893170734/|title=Great Commoner Bryan dies in sleep, apoplexy given as cause of death|website=UPI Archives|date=July 27, 1925|access-date=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born and raised in Illinois, Bryan moved to Nebraska in the 1880s. He won election to the House of Representatives in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1890|1890 elections]], serving two terms before making an unsuccessful run for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in 1894. At the [[1896 Democratic National Convention]], Bryan delivered his "[[Cross of Gold speech]]" which attacked the [[gold standard]] and the eastern moneyed interests and crusaded for inflationary policies built around [[free silver|the expanded coinage of silver coins]]. In a repudiation of incumbent President [[Grover Cleveland]] and his conservative [[Bourbon Democrats]], the Democratic convention nominated Bryan for president, making Bryan the youngest major party presidential nominee in U.S. history. Subsequently, Bryan was also nominated for president by the left-wing [[People's Party (United States)|Populist Party]], and many Populists would eventually follow Bryan into the Democratic Party. In the intensely fought [[United States presidential election, 1896|1896 presidential election]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[William McKinley]] emerged triumphant. Bryan gained fame as an orator as he invented the national stumping tour when he reached an audience of 5 million people in 27 states in 1896.

Bryan retained control of the Democratic Party and won the presidential nomination again in [[United States presidential election, 1900|1900]]. In the aftermath of the [[Spanish–American War]], Bryan became a fierce opponent of [[American imperialism]], and much of the campaign centered on that issue. In the election, McKinley again defeated Bryan, winning several Western states that Bryan had won in 1896. Bryan's influence in the party weakened after the 1900 election, and the Democrats nominated the conservative [[Alton B. Parker]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1904|1904 presidential election]]. Bryan regained his stature in the party after Parker's resounding defeat by [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and voters from both parties increasingly embraced the progressive reforms that had long been championed by Bryan. Bryan won his party's nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 1908|1908 presidential election]], but he was defeated by Roosevelt's chosen successor, [[William Howard Taft]]. Along with [[Henry Clay]], Bryan is one of the two individuals since 1804 who received [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] in three separate presidential elections but never won a presidential election. The 493 cumulative electoral votes cast for Bryan in those three elections are the most received by a presidential candidate never elected. 

After the Democrats won the presidency in the [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912 election]], Woodrow Wilson rewarded Bryan's support with the important cabinet position of Secretary of State. Bryan helped Wilson pass several progressive reforms through Congress, but he and Wilson clashed over U.S. neutrality in [[World War I]]. Bryan resigned from his post in 1915 after Wilson sent [[German Empire|Germany]] a note of protest in response to the sinking of the ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'' by a German [[U-Boat]]. After leaving office, Bryan retained some of his influence within the Democratic Party, but he increasingly devoted himself to religious matters and anti-[[evolution]] activism. He opposed [[Darwinism]] on religious and humanitarian grounds, most famously in the 1925 [[Scopes Trial]]. Since his death in 1925, Bryan has elicited mixed reactions from various commentators, but he is widely considered to have been one of the most influential figures of the [[Progressive Era]].

==Early life and education==
[[File:William Jennings Bryan Boyhood Home.jpg|thumb|right|Bryan's birthplace in Salem, Illinois]]
[[File:Mary Baird Bryan cph.3a35947.jpg|thumb|upright|Attorney Mary Baird Bryan, the wife of William Jennings Bryan]]

William Jennings Bryan was born in [[Salem, Illinois]], on March 19, 1860, to [[Silas Bryan|Silas Lillard Bryan]] and Mariah Elizabeth (Jennings) Bryan.&lt;ref name="nebraskahistory.org"&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/lib-arch/research/manuscripts/politics/bryanwj.htm William Jennings Bryan] Nebraska State Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt; Silas Bryan had been born in 1822, and had established a legal practice in Salem in 1851. He married Mariah, a former student of his at [[McKendree University|McKendree College]], in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Of [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] and English ancestry,{{efn|Asked when his family "dropped the 'O'" from his O'Bryan surname, he replied there had never been one.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan ''Memoirs of William Jennings Bryan'', pp. 22–26.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Silas Bryan was an avid [[Jacksonian Democrat]]. He won election as a state circuit judge, and in 1866 moved his family to a {{convert|520|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} farm north of Salem, living in a ten-room house that was the envy of [[Marion County, Illinois|Marion County]].&lt;ref&gt;Colletta (1964), p. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Silas served in various local positions and sought election to Congress in 1872, but was narrowly defeated by the Republican candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; An admirer of [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Stephen A. Douglas]], Silas passed on his Democratic affiliation to his son, William, who would remain a life-long Democrat.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 4–5, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryan was the fourth child of Silas and Mariah, but all three of his older siblings died during infancy. Bryan also had five younger siblings, four of whom lived to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan was home-schooled by his mother until the age of ten. Silas was a [[Baptists in the United States|Baptist]] and Mariah was a [[History of Methodism in the United States|Methodist]], but Bryan's parents allowed him to choose his own church. At age fourteen, Bryan had a conversion experience at a revival. He said it was the most important day of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thisday.pcahistory.org/2012/03/march-19-william-jennings-bryan/|title=PCA History On This Day March 19: William Jennings Bryan|last=|first=|date=March 19, 2012|website=PCA History|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan also devoted himself to oratory, giving public speeches as early as the age of four.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; At age fifteen, Bryan was sent to attend Whipple Academy, a private school in [[Jacksonville, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Jennings Bryan 2.jpg|thumb|upright|A young Bryan]]

After graduating from Whipple Academy, Bryan entered [[Illinois College]], which was also located in Jacksonville. During his time at Illinois College, Bryan served as chaplain of the [[Sigma Pi literary society]].&lt;ref name="kazin910"&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; He also continued to hone his public speaking skills, taking part in numerous debates and oratorical contests.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, while still in college, Bryan met Mary Elizabeth Baird, the daughter of an owner of a nearby [[general store]], and began courting her.&lt;ref name="Kazin 2006, pp. 13–14"&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan and Mary Elizabeth married on October 1, 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Colletta (1964), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Elizabeth would emerge as an important part of Bryan's career, managing his correspondence and helping him prepare speeches and articles.&lt;ref name="Kazin 2006, pp. 13–14"/&gt;

After graduating from college at the top of his class,&lt;ref name="kazin910"/&gt; Bryan studied law at Union Law College (which later became [[Northwestern University School of Law]]) in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Colletta (1964), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; While attending law school, Bryan worked for attorney [[Lyman Trumbull]], a former senator and friend of Silas Bryan's who would serve as an important political ally to the younger Bryan until his death in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from law school, Bryan returned to Jacksonville to take a position with local law firm. Frustrated by the lack of political and economic opportunities in Jacksonville, in 1887 Bryan and his wife moved west to [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], the capital of the fast-growing state of [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
{{See also|Presidency of Benjamin Harrison|Presidencies of Grover Cleveland}}

===Congressional service===

Bryan established a successful legal practice in Lincoln with partner Adolphus Talbot, a Republican whom Bryan had known in law school.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 17–19&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan also entered local politics, campaigning on behalf of Democrats like [[Julius Sterling Morton]] and [[Grover Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 22–24&lt;/ref&gt; After earning notoriety for his effective speeches in 1888, Bryan ran for Congress in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1890|1890 election]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan called for a reduction in [[Tariffs in United States history|tariff]] rates, the coinage of silver at a ratio equal to that of gold, and action to stem the power of [[Trust law|trusts]]. In part due to a series of strong debate performances, Bryan defeated incumbent Republican Congressman [[William James Connell]], who campaigned on the orthodox Republican platform centered around the [[protective tariff]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 25–27&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan's victory made him only the second Democrat to represent Nebraska in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Colletta (1964), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Nationwide, Democrats picked up seventy-six seats in the House, giving the party a majority in that chamber. The [[People's Party (United States)|Populist Party]], a [[Third party (United States)|third party]] that drew support from agrarian voters in the West, also picked up several seats in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of Congressman [[William McKendree Springer]], Bryan secured a coveted spot on the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means Committee]]. He quickly earned a reputation as a talented orator, and he set out to gain a strong understanding of the key economic issues of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 31–34&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Gilded Age]], the Democratic Party had begun to separate into two groups. The conservative northern "[[Bourbon Democrats]]," along with some allies in the South, sought to limit the size and power of the federal government. Another group of Democrats, drawings its membership largely from the agrarian movements of the South and West, favored greater federal intervention in order to help farmers, regulate railroads, and limit the power of large corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 20–22&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan became affiliated with the latter group, advocating for the free coinage of silver ("[[free silver]]") and the establishment of a [[Progressive tax|progressive]] federal [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]]. Though it endeared him to many reformers, Bryan's call for free silver cost him the support of Morton and some other conservative Nebraska Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 33–36&lt;/ref&gt; Free silver advocates were opposed by banks and bond holders who feared the effects of inflation.&lt;ref&gt;Hibben (1929), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryan sought re-election in 1892 with the support of many Populists, and he backed Populist presidential candidate [[James B. Weaver]] instead of the Democratic presidential candidate, Grover Cleveland. Bryan won re-election by just 140 votes, while Cleveland defeated Weaver and incumbent Republican President [[Benjamin Harrison]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1892|1892 presidential election]]. Cleveland appointed a cabinet consisting largely of conservative Democrats like Morton, who became Cleveland's [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|secretary of agriculture]]. Shortly after Cleveland took office, a series of bank closures brought on the [[Panic of 1893]], a major economic crisis. In response, Cleveland called a [[special session]] of Congress with the intention of repealing the 1890 [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]], which required the federal government to purchase several million ounces of silver every month. Though Bryan mounted a campaign to save the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, a coalition of Republicans and Democrats successfully repealed it.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 35–38&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan was, however, successful in passing an amendment that provided for the establishment of the first peacetime federal income tax.&lt;ref name="kazin51"&gt;Kazin (2006), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The tax would be struck down by the Supreme Court in the 1895 case of ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.]]''.&lt;ref name="kazin51"/&gt;}}

As the economy declined after 1893, the reforms favored by Bryan and the Populists became more popular among many voters. Rather than running for re-election in 1894, Bryan sought election to the [[United States Senate]]. He also became the editor-in-chief of the ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'', although most editorial duties were performed by [[Richard Lee Metcalfe]] and [[Gilbert Hitchcock]]. Nationwide, the Republican Party won a huge victory in the [[United States elections, 1894|elections of 1894]], gaining over 120 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. In Nebraska, despite Bryan's popularity, the Republicans elected a majority of the state legislators, and Bryan lost the senate election to Republican [[John Mellen Thurston]].{{efn|U.S. senators were elected by the state legislature prior to the ratification of the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]] in 1913}} Bryan was nonetheless pleased with the result of the 1894 election, as the Cleveland wing of the Democratic Party had been discredited and Bryan's preferred gubernatorial candidate, [[Silas A. Holcomb]], had been elected by a coalition of Democrats and Populists.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 40–43&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1894 elections, Bryan engaged in a nationwide speaking tour designed to boost free silver, move his party away from the conservative policies of the Cleveland administration, lure Populists and free silver Republicans into the Democratic Party, and raise Bryan's public profile in advance of the next election. Speaking fees allowed Bryan to give up his legal practice and devote himself full-time to oratory.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 46–48&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1896, free silver forces were ascendant within the party. Though many Democratic leaders were not as enthusiastic about free silver as Bryan was, most recognized the need to distance the party from the unpopular policies of the Cleveland administration. By the start of the [[1896 Democratic National Convention]], Congressman [[Richard P. Bland]], a long-time champion of free silver, was widely perceived to be the front-runner for the party's presidential nomination. Bryan hoped to offer himself as a presidential candidate, but his youth and relative inexperience gave him a lower profile than veteran Democrats like Bland, Governor [[Horace Boies]] of Iowa, and Vice President [[Adlai Stevenson I|Adlai Stevenson]]. The free silver forces quickly established dominance over the convention, and Bryan helped draft a [[party platform]] that repudiated Cleveland, attacked the conservative rulings of the Supreme Court, and called the [[gold standard]] "not only un-American but anti-American."&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 53–55, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative Democrats demanded a debate on the party platform, and on the third day of the convention each side put forth speakers to debate free silver and the gold standard. Bryan and Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]] of South Carolina were chosen as the speakers who would advocate on behalf of free silver, but Tillman's speech was poorly received by delegates from outside the South due to its sectionalism and references to the Civil War. Charged with delivering the convention's last speech on the topic of monetary policy, Bryan seized his opportunity to emerge as the nation's leading Democrat. In his [[Cross of gold speech|"Cross of Gold" speech]], Bryan argued that the debate over monetary policy was part of a broader struggle for democracy, political independence, and the welfare of the "common man." Bryan's speech was met with rapturous applause and a celebration on the floor of the convention that lasted for over half an hour.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 56–62&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, the Democratic Party held its presidential ballot. With the continuing support of Governor [[John Altgeld]] of Illinois, Bland led the first ballot of the convention, but he fell far short of the necessary two-thirds majority of delegates. Bryan finished in a distant second on the convention's first ballot, but his Cross of Gold speech had left a strong impression on many delegates. Despite the distrust of party leaders like Altgeld, who was wary of supporting an untested candidate, Bryan's strength grew over the next four ballots. He gained the lead on the fourth ballot and won his party's presidential nomination on the fifth ballot.&lt;ref name="kazin6263"/&gt; At the age of 36, Bryan became (and still remains) the youngest presidential nominee of a major party in American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Glass |first1=Andrew |title=William Jennings Bryan born, March 19, 1860 |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2012/03/william-jennings-bryan-born-074146 |accessdate=3 August 2018 |publisher=Politico |date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention nominated [[Arthur Sewall]], a wealthy Maine shipbuilder who also favored free silver and the income tax, as Bryan's running mate.&lt;ref name="kazin6263"&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;

====General election====

Conservative Democrats known as the "[[National Democratic Party (United States)|Gold Democrats]]" nominated a separate ticket. Cleveland himself did not publicly attack Bryan, but privately he favored the Republican candidate, [[William McKinley]], over Bryan. Many urban newspapers in the Northeast and Midwest that had supported previous Democratic tickets also opposed Bryan's candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan did, however, win the support of the Populist Party, which nominated a ticket consisting of Bryan and [[Thomas E. Watson]] of Georgia. Though Populist leaders feared that the nomination of the Democratic candidate would damage the party in the long-term, they shared many of Bryan's political views and had developed a productive working relationship with Bryan.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 63–65&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican campaign painted McKinley as the "advance agent of prosperity" and social harmony, and warned of the supposed dangers of electing Bryan. McKinley and his campaign manager, [[Mark Hanna]], knew that McKinley could not match Bryan's oratorical skills. Rather than giving speeches on the campaign trail, the Republican nominee conducted a [[front porch campaign]]. Hanna, meanwhile, raised an unprecedented amount of money, dispatched campaign surrogates, and organized the distribution of millions of pieces of campaign literature.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 65–67&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ElectoralCollege1896.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|1896 electoral vote results]]

Facing a huge campaign finance disadvantage, the Democratic campaign relied largely on Bryan's oratorical skills. Breaking with the precedent set by most major party nominees, Bryan gave some 600 speeches, primarily in the hotly contested Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Safire|title=Lend Me Your Ears: Great Speeches in History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EKkO4JBxtVkC&amp;pg=PA922|year=2004|publisher=W.W. Norton|page=922}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan invented the national [[stump speech (politics)|stumping tour]], reaching an audience of 5 million in 27 states.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Ellis And Mark Dedrick, "The Presidential Candidate, Then and Now" ''Perspectives on Political Science'' (1997) 26#4 pp 208-216 [http://www.uvm.edu/~dguber/POLS125/articles/ellis.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt; He was building a coalition of the white South, poor northern farmers and industrial workers, and silver miners against banks and railroads and the "money power". Free silver appealed to farmers who would be paid more for their products but not to industrial workers who would not get higher wages but would pay higher prices.  The industrial cities voted for McKinley as he swept nearly all of the East and industrial Midwest, and did well along the border and the West Coast. Bryan swept the South and Mountain states and the  wheat growing regions of the Midwest. Revivalistic Protestants cheered at Bryan's semi-religious rhetoric. Ethnic voters supported McKinley, who promised they would not be excluded from the new prosperity, as did more prosperous farmers and the fast-growing middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Nelson|title=Guide to the Presidency|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fK_lCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA363|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Rove|title=The Triumph of William McKinley: Why the Election of 1896 Still Matters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q_agDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA368|year=2016|pages=367–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKinley won the election by a fairly comfortable margin, taking 51 percent of the popular vote and 271 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 76–79&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats remained loyal to their champion after his defeat; many letters urged him to run again in the [[United States presidential election, 1900|1900 presidential election]]. William's younger brother, [[Charles W. Bryan]], created a card file of supporters to whom the Bryans would send regular mailings to for the next thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 80–82&lt;/ref&gt; The Populist Party fractured after the election; many Populists, including James Weaver, followed Bryan into the Democratic Party, while others followed [[Eugene V. Debs]] into the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt;

===War and peace: 1898–1900===
====Spanish–American War====
{{see also|Presidency of William McKinley}}

Due to better economic conditions for farmers and the effects of the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], free silver lost its potency as an electoral issue in the years following 1896. In 1900, President McKinley signed the [[Gold Standard Act]], which put the United States on the [[gold standard]]. Bryan remained popular in the Democratic Party, and his supporters took control of party organizations throughout the country, but he initially resisted shifting his political focus from free silver.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 83–86&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign policy emerged as an important issue due to the ongoing [[Cuban War of Independence]] against [[Spain]], as many Americans supported Cuban independence. After the explosion of the ''[[USS Maine (ACR-1)|USS Maine]]'' in [[Havana Harbor]], the United States declared war on Spain in April 1898, beginning the [[Spanish–American War]]. Though wary of [[militarism]], Bryan had long favored Cuban independence, and he supported the war.&lt;ref name="kazin8689"&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 86–89&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that "universal peace cannot come until justice is enthroned throughout the world. Until the right has triumphed in every land and love reigns in every heart, government must, as a last resort, appeal to force".&lt;ref&gt;Sicius (2015), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American Colonies.png|thumb|upright=1.8|The United States and its colonial possessions after the Spanish–American War]]

At Governor [[Silas A. Holcomb]]'s request, Bryan recruited a two thousand man regiment for the Nebraska National Guard, and the soldiers of the regiment elected Bryan as their leader. Under Colonel Bryan's command, the regiment was transported to [[Camp Cuba Libre]] in [[Florida]], but the fighting between Spain and the United States ended before the regiment was deployed to Cuba. Bryan's regiment remained in Florida for months after the end of the war, thereby preventing Bryan from taking an active role in the [[United States elections, 1898|1898 mid-term elections]]. Bryan resigned his commission and left Florida in December 1898 after the United States and Spain signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]].&lt;ref name="kazin8689"/&gt;

Bryan had supported the war as a means to gain Cuba's independence, but he was outraged that the Treaty of Paris granted the United States control over the [[Philippines]]. While many Republicans believed that the United States had an obligation to "civilize" the Philippines, Bryan strongly opposed what he saw as [[American imperialism]]. Despite his opposition to the annexation of the Philippines, Bryan urged his supporters to ratify the Treaty of Paris; he wanted to quickly bring an official end the war and then grant independence to the Philippines as soon as possible. With Bryan's support, the treaty was ratified in a close vote, bringing an official end to the Spanish–American War. In early 1899, the [[Philippine–American War]] broke out as Filipinos under the leadership of [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] sought to end American rule over the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 89–91&lt;/ref&gt;

====Presidential election of 1900====
{{Main|William Jennings Bryan presidential campaign, 1900}}
[[File:Rogers cartoon about William Jennings Bryan reconstructing the Democratic Party platform.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Conservatives in 1900 ridiculed Bryan's eclectic platform.]]

The [[1900 Democratic National Convention]] met in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], the westernmost location that either major party had ever held a national convention. Some Democratic leaders opposed to Bryan had hoped to nominate Admiral [[George Dewey]] for president, but Bryan faced no significant opposition by the time of the convention, and he won his party's nomination unanimously. Bryan did not attend the convention, but he exercised control of the convention's proceedings via [[telegraph]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan faced a decision regarding what issue his campaign would focus on. Many of his most fervent supporters wanted Bryan to continue his crusade for free silver, while Democrats from the Northeast advised Bryan to center his campaign on the growing power of trusts. Bryan, however, decided that his campaign would focus on anti-imperialism, partly as a way to unite the factions of the party and win over some Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 95–98&lt;/ref&gt; The party platform contained planks supporting free silver and opposing the power of trusts, but imperialism was labeled as the "paramount issue" of the campaign. The party nominated former Vice President Adlai Stevenson to serve as Bryan's running mate.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Imperialism speech|his speech]] accepting the Democratic nomination, Bryan argued that the election represented "a contest between democracy and plutocracy." He also strongly criticized the U.S. annexation of the Philippines, comparing it to the British rule of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. Bryan argued that the United States should refrain from imperialism, and should seek to become the "supreme moral factor in the world's progress and the accepted arbiter of the world's disputes."&lt;ref name="Kazin 2006, pp. 102–103"&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 102–103&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900, the [[American Anti-Imperialist League]], which included individuals like Benjamin Harrison, [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[Carl Schurz]], and [[Mark Twain]], had emerged as the primary domestic organization opposed to the continued American control of the Philippines. Many of the leaders of the league had opposed Bryan in 1896 and continued to distrust Bryan and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this distrust, Bryan's strong stance against imperialism convinced most of the league's leadership to throw their support behind the Democratic nominee.&lt;ref name="Kazin 2006, pp. 102–103"/&gt;

[[File:ElectoralCollege1900.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|1900 electoral vote results]]

Once again, the McKinley campaign established a massive financial advantage, while the Democratic campaign relied largely on Bryan's oratory.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 104–105&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical day Bryan gave four hour-long speeches and shorter talks that added up to six hours of speaking. At an average rate of 175 words a minute, he turned out 63,000 words a day, enough to fill 52 columns of a newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Coletta (1964), p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican Party's superior organization and finances boosted McKinley's candidacy, and, as in the previous campaign, most major newspapers favored McKinley. Bryan also had to contend with the Republican vice presidential nominee, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who had emerged as national celebrity in the Spanish–American War and proved to be a strong public speaker. Bryan's anti-imperialism failed to register with many voters, and as the campaign neared its end, Bryan increasingly shifted to attacks on corporate power. He once again sought the voter of urban laborers, telling them to vote against the business interests that had "condemn[ed] the boys of this country to perpetual clerkship."&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 105–107&lt;/ref&gt;

By election day, few believed that Bryan would win, and McKinley ultimately prevailed once again over Bryan. Compared to the results of 1896, McKinley increased his popular vote margin and picked up several Western states, including Bryan's home state of Nebraska.&lt;ref name="kazin107108"&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican platform of a strong American industrial economy proved to be more important to voters than questions of the morality of annexing the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Clements (1982), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The election also confirmed the continuing organizational advantage of the Republican Party outside of the South.&lt;ref name="kazin107108"/&gt;

===Between presidential campaigns, 1901–1907===
{{See also|Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt|Alton Parker presidential campaign, 1904}}

After the election, Bryan returned to journalism and oratory, frequently appearing on the [[Chautauqua]] circuits.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1901, Bryan published the first issue of his weekly newspaper, ''[[The Commoner]]'', which echoed Bryan's long-standing political and religious themes. Bryan served as the editor and publisher of the newspaper, but Charles Bryan, Mary Bryan, and Richard Metcalfe also performed editorial duties when Bryan was traveling. ''The Commoner'' became one of the most widely-read newspapers of its era, boasting 145,000 subscribers approximately five years after its founding. Though the paper's subscriber base heavily overlapped with Bryan's political base in the Midwest, content from the papers was frequently re-printed by major newspapers in the Northeast. In 1902, Bryan, his wife, and his three children moved into [[William Jennings Bryan House (Lincoln, Nebraska)|Fairview]], a mansion located in Lincoln; Bryan referred to the house as the "[[Monticello]] of the West," and frequently invited politicians and diplomats to visit.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 111–113&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryan's defeat in 1900 cost him his status as the clear leader of the Democratic Party, and conservatives like [[David B. Hill]] and [[Arthur Pue Gorman]] moved to re-establish their control over the party and return it to the policies of the Cleveland era. Meanwhile, Roosevelt succeeded McKinley as president after the latter was [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassinated]] in September 1901. Roosevelt prosecuted anti-trust cases and implemented other [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] policies, but Bryan argued that Roosevelt did not fully embrace progressive causes. Bryan called for a package of reforms, including a federal income tax, pure food and drug laws, a ban on corporate financing of campaigns, a constitutional amendment providing for the direct election of senators, local ownership of utilities, and the state adoption of the [[initiative]] and the [[referendum]]. He also criticized Roosevelt's foreign policy and attacked Roosevelt's decision to invite [[Booker T. Washington]] to dine at the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: William Jennings Bryan, 1860-1925.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bryan in 1908]]

Prior to the [[1904 Democratic National Convention]], [[Alton B. Parker|Alton Parker]], a New York judge and conservative ally of David Hill, was seen as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Conservatives feared that Bryan would join with publisher [[William Randolph Hearst]] to block Parker's nomination. Seeking to appease Bryan and other progressives, Hill agreed to a party platform that omitted mention of the gold standard and criticized trusts.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 114–116&lt;/ref&gt; Parker won the Democratic nomination, but Roosevelt won re-election by the largest popular vote margin since the Civil War. Parker's crushing defeat vindicated Bryan, who published a post-election edition of ''The Commoner'' that advised its readers: "Do not Compromise with Plutocracy."&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryan traveled to Europe in 1903, meeting with figures such as [[Leo Tolstoy]], who shared some of Bryan's religious and political views.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 126–128&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, Bryan and his family embarked on a trip around the globe, visiting eighteen countries in Asia and Europe. Bryan funded the trip with public speaking fees and a travelogue that was published on a weekly basis.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 121–122&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan was greeted by a large crowd upon his return to the United States in 1906, and was widely seen as the likely 1908 Democratic presidential nominee. Partly due to the efforts of [[muckraker|muckraking]] journalists, voters had become increasingly open to progressive ideas since 1904. President Roosevelt himself had moved to the left, favoring federal regulation of railroad rates and meatpacking plants.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Bryan continued to favor more far-reaching reforms, including federal regulation of banks and [[Security (finance)|securities]], protections for union organizers, and federal spending on highway construction and education. Bryan also briefly expressed support for the state and federal ownership of railroads in a manner similar to [[Germany]], but backed down from this policy in the face of an intra-party backlash.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 145–149&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential election of 1908===
{{Main|William Jennings Bryan presidential campaign, 1908}}
[[File:William Jennings Bryan at the 1908 DNC (1) (cropped1).jpg|thumb|Bryan speaking at the [[1908 Democratic National Convention]]]]

Roosevelt, who enjoyed wide popularity among most voters even while he alienated some corporate leaders, anointed Secretary of War [[William Howard Taft]] as his successor.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 151–152&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Bryan reestablished his control over the Democratic Party, winning the endorsement of numerous local Democratic organizations. Conservative Democrats again sought to prevent Bryan's nomination, but were unable to unite around an alternative candidate. Bryan was nominated for president on the first ballot of the [[1908 Democratic National Convention]]. He was joined on the Democratic ticket by [[John W. Kern]], a senator from the swing state of Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 152–154&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryan campaigned on a party platform that reflected his long held beliefs, but the Republican platform also advocated for progressive policies, leaving relatively few major differences between the two major parties. One issue that the two parties differed on concerned deposit insurance, as Bryan favored requiring [[National Bank Act|national banks]] to provide [[deposit insurance]]. Bryan was largely able to unify the leaders of his own party, and his pro-labor policies won him the first presidential endorsement ever issued by the [[American Federation of Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 154–157&lt;/ref&gt; As in previous campaigns, Bryan embarked on a public speaking tour to boost his candidacy; he was later joined on the trail by Taft.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;

Defying Bryan's confidence in his own victory, Taft decisively won the 1908 presidential election. Bryan won just a handful of states outside of the Solid South, as he failed to galvanize the support of urban laborers.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan remains the only individual since the Civil War to lose three separate U.S. presidential elections as a major party nominee.&lt;ref name="kazinxix"/&gt; Since the ratification of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]], Bryan and [[Henry Clay]] are the lone individuals who received electoral votes in three separate presidential elections but lost all three elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klotter |first1=James C. |title=Henry Clay: The Man Who Would Be President |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press | page=xvii | isbn=9780190498054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ElectoralCollege1908.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|1908 electoral vote results]]

Bryan remained an influential figure in republican politics, and, after Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in the [[United States elections, 1910|1910 mid-term elections]], he appeared in the House of Representatives to argue for tariff reduction.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 179–181&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, Bryan came out publicly for the first time in favor of [[Prohibition]]. A lifelong [[teetotaler]], Bryan had refrained from embracing Prohibition earlier because of the issue's unpopularity among many Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 172–173&lt;/ref&gt; According to biographer Paolo Colletta, Bryan "sincerely believed that prohibition would contribute to the physical health and moral improvement of the individual, stimulate civic progress, and end the notorious abuses connected with the liquor traffic."&lt;ref&gt;Coletta (1969, Vol. 2), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, he also came out in favor of [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan crusaded as well for legislation to support introduction of the [[initiative]] and [[referendum]] as a means of giving voters a direct voice, making a whistle-stop campaign tour of Arkansas in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Steven L. Piott, ''Giving Voters a Voice: The Origins of the Initiative and Referendum in America'' (2003) pp. 126–32&lt;/ref&gt; Although some observers, including President Taft, speculated that Bryan would make a fourth run for the presidency, Bryan repeatedly denied that he had any such intention.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wilson presidency==
{{Further|Presidency of Woodrow Wilson}}

===1912 election===
[[File:W.J. Bryan (LOC) (3490812011).jpg|thumb|Right|Bryan attending the [[1912 Democratic National Convention]]]]

A growing rift in the Republican Party gave Democrats their best chance in years to win the presidency. Though Bryan would not seek the Democratic presidential nomination, his continuing influence in the party gave him a role in choosing the party's nominee. Bryan was intent on preventing the conservatives in the party from nominating their candidate of choice, as they had done in 1904. For a mix of practical and ideological reasons, Bryan ruled out supporting the candidacies of [[Oscar Underwood]], [[Judson Harmon]], and [[Joseph W. Folk]], leaving two major candidates competing for his backing: New Jersey Governor [[Woodrow Wilson]] and Speaker of the House [[Champ Clark]]. As Speaker, Clark could lay claim to progressive accomplishments, including the passage of constitutional amendments providing for the direct election of senators and the establishment of a federal income tax. But Clark had alienated Bryan for his failure to lower the tariff, and Bryan viewed the Speaker as overly friendly to conservative business interests. Wilson had criticized Bryan in the past, but he had compiled a strong progressive record as governor. As the [[1912 Democratic National Convention]] approached, Bryan continued to deny that he would seek the presidency, but many journalists and politicians suspected that Bryan hoped a deadlocked convention would turn to him.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 181–184&lt;/ref&gt;

After the start of the convention, Bryan engineered the passage of a resolution stating that the party was "opposed to the nomination of any candidate who is a representative of, or under any obligation to, [[J. Pierpont Morgan]], [[Thomas Fortune Ryan|Thomas F. Ryan]], [[August Belmont]], or any other member of the privilege-hunting and favor-seeking class." Clark and Wilson won the support of most delegates on the first several presidential ballots of the Democratic convention, but each fell short of the necessary two-thirds majority. After [[Tammany Hall]] came out in favor Clark and the New York delegation threw its support behind the Speaker, Bryan announced that he would support Wilson. In explaining his decision, Bryan stated that he could "not be a party to the nomination of any man ... who will not, when elected, be absolutely free to carry out the anti-Morgan-Ryan-Belmont resolution." Bryan's speech marked the start of a long shift away from Clark, and Wilson would finally clinch the presidential nomination after over 40 ballots. Journalists attributed much of the credit for Wilson's victory to Bryan.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 187–191&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912 presidential election]], Wilson faced off against President Taft and former President Roosevelt, the latter of whom ran on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] ticket. Bryan campaigned throughout the West on behalf of Wilson, while also offering advice to the Democratic nominee on various issues. The split in the Republican ranks helped give Wilson the presidency, and Wilson won over 400 electoral votes despite taking just 41.8 percent of the popular vote. In the concurrent congressional elections, Democrats expanded their majority in the House and gained control of the Senate, giving the party unified control of Congress and the presidency for the first time since the early 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 191–192, 215&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secretary of State===
{{see also|Banana Wars|American entry into World War I}}
[[File:President Wilson 1919-bw.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Bryan served as Secretary of State under President [[Woodrow Wilson]]]]
[[File:Berryman cartoon about William Jennings Bryan reading war dispatches.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Cartoon of Secretary of State Bryan reading war news in 1914]]

Upon taking office, Wilson named Bryan as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Bryan's extensive travels, popularity in the party, and support for Wilson in the 1912 election made him the obvious choice for what was traditionally considered to be the highest-ranking position in the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]]. Bryan took charge of a [[United States Department of State|State Department]] that employed 150 officials in Washington and an additional 400 employees in embassies abroad. Early in Wilson's tenure, the president and the secretary of state broadly agreed on foreign policy goals, including the rejection of Taft's [[Dollar diplomacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 215–217, 222–223&lt;/ref&gt; They also shared many priorities in domestic affairs, and, with Bryan's help, Wilson orchestrated passage of laws that reduced tariff rates, imposed a progressive income tax, introduced new anti-trust measures, and established the [[Federal Reserve System]]. Bryan proved particularly influential in ensuring that the president, rather than private bankers, was empowered to appoint the members of the [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 223–227&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretary of State Bryan pursued a series of bilateral treaties in which both signatories promised to submit all disputes to an investigative tribunal. He quickly won approval from the president and the Senate to proceed with his initiative, and in mid-1913 [[El Salvador]] became the first nation to sign one of Bryan's treaties. 29 other countries, including every [[great power]] in Europe other than Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]], also agreed to sign the treaties.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 217–218&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Bryan's aversion to conflict, he oversaw U.S. interventions in [[Haiti]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 229–231&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]] broke out in Europe, Bryan consistently advocated for U.S. neutrality between the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] and the [[Central Powers]]. With Bryan's support, Wilson initially sought to stay out of the conflict, urging Americans to be "impartial in thought as well as action."&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt; For much of 1914, Bryan attempted to bring a negotiated end to the war, but the leaders of both the Entente and the Central Powers were ultimately uninterested in American mediation. While Bryan remained firmly committed to neutrality, Wilson and others within the administration became increasingly sympathetic to the Entente. The March 1915 [[Thrasher incident]], in which a German [[U-boat]] sank a British passenger ship with an American citizen onboard, provided a major blow to the cause of American neutrality. The May 1915 [[sinking of the RMS Lusitania]] by another German U-boat further galvanized anti-German sentiment, as 128 Americans died in the incident. Bryan argued that the British [[blockade of Germany]] was equally as offensive as the German [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|U-boat Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 234–236&lt;/ref&gt; He also maintained that by traveling on British vessels, "an American citizen can, by putting his own business above his regard for this country, assume for his own advantage unnecessary risks and thus involve his country in international complications."&lt;ref&gt;Levine (1987), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; After Wilson sent an official message of protest to Germany, and refused to publicly warn Americans not to travel on British ships, Bryan delivered his letter of resignation to Wilson on June 8, 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 237–238&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
===Political involvement===

Despite their differences over foreign policy, Bryan supported Wilson's [[United States presidential election, 1916|1916]] re-election campaign. Though he did not attend as an official delegate, the [[1916 Democratic National Convention]] suspended its own rules to allow Bryan to address the convention; Bryan delivered a well-received speech in which he strongly defended Wilson's domestic record. Bryan served as a campaign surrogate for Wilson in the 1916 campaign, delivering dozens of speeches, primarily to audiences west of the [[Mississippi River]]. Ultimately, Wilson narrowly prevailed over the Republican candidate, [[Charles Evans Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 248–252&lt;/ref&gt; When the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Bryan wrote Wilson, "Believing it to be the duty of the citizen to bear his part of the burden of war and his share of the peril, I hereby tender my services to the Government. Please enroll me as a private whenever I am needed and assign me to any work that I can do."&lt;ref&gt;Hibben (1929), p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson declined to appoint Bryan to a federal position, but Bryan did agree to Wilson's request to provide public support for the war effort through his speeches and articles.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 254–255&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, despite some reservations, Bryan supported Wilson's unsuccessful effort to bring the United States into the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 258–260&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving office, Bryan spent much of his time advocating for the [[eight-hour day]], a [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage]], the right of unions to strike and, increasingly, women's suffrage and Prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Congress passed the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]], providing for nationwide Prohibition, in 1917. Two years later, Congress passed the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]], which granted women the right to vote nationwide. Both amendments were ratified in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, Bryan called for further reforms, including agricultural subsidies, the guarantee of a [[living wage]], full public financing of political campaigns, and an end to legal gender discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 267–268&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Prohibitionists and other Bryan supporters tried to convince the three-time presidential candidate to enter the [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920 presidential election]], and a ''[[Literary Digest]]'' poll taken in mid-1920 ranked Bryan as the fourth-most popular potential Democratic candidate. Bryan, however, declined to seek public office, writing "if I can help this world to banish alcohol, and after that to banish war ... no office, no Presidency, can offer the honors that will be mine." He attended the [[1920 Democratic National Convention]] as a delegate from Nebraska, but was disappointed by the nomination of Governor [[James M. Cox]], who had not supported ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment. Bryan declined the presidential nomination of the [[Prohibition Party]] and refused to campaign for Cox, making the 1920 campaign the first presidential contest in over thirty years in which he did not actively campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 269–271&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he became less involved in Democratic politics after 1920, Bryan attended the [[1924 Democratic National Convention]] as a delegate from Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 282–283&lt;/ref&gt; He helped defeat a resolution condemning the [[Ku Klux Klan]] because he expected that the organization would soon fold; Bryan disliked the Klan but never publicly attacked it.&lt;ref&gt;Coletta (1969, Vol. 3), pp. 162, 177, 184&lt;/ref&gt; He also strongly opposed the candidacy of [[Al Smith]] due to Smith's hostility towards Prohibition. After over 100 ballots, the Democratic convention nominated [[John W. Davis]], a conservative [[Wall Street]] lawyer. To balance the conservative Bryan with a progressive, the convention nominated Bryan's brother, Charles Bryan, for vice president. Bryan was disappointed by the nomination of Davis, but strongly approved of the nomination of his brother, and he delivered numerous campaign speeches on behalf of the Democratic ticket. Davis suffered one of the worst losses in the Democratic Party's history, taking just 29 percent of the vote against Republican President [[Calvin Coolidge]] and third party candidate [[Robert M. La Follette]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 283–285&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florida real estate promoter===
[[File:Winter Home of Wm. J. Bryan, Miami, FL.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Villa Serena]]'', Bryan's home built in 1913 at Miami, Florida]]

To help Mary cope with her worsening health during the harsh winters of Nebraska, the Bryans bought a farm in [[Mission, Texas]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Mary's arthritis, in 1912 the Bryans began building a new home in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], known as [[Villa Serena]]. The Bryans made Villa Serena their permanent home, while Charles Bryan continued to oversee ''The Commoner'' from Lincoln. The Bryans were active citizens in Miami, leading a fundraising drive for the [[YMCA]] and frequently hosting the public at their home.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 245–247&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan undertook lucrative speaking engagements, often serving as a spokesman for [[George E. Merrick]]'s new planned community of [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]].&lt;ref&gt;George, Paul S. "Brokers, Binders &amp; Builders: Greater Miami's Boom of the Mid-1920s." ''Florida Historical Quarterly,'' vol. 59, no. 4. 1981. pp. 440–63.&lt;/ref&gt; His promotions probably contributed to the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s|Florida real estate boom of the 1920s]], which collapsed within months of Bryan's death in 1925.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Anti-evolution activism===

In the 1920s, Bryan shifted his focus away from politics, becoming one of the most prominent religious figures in the country.&lt;ref name="kazin262263"&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 262–263&lt;/ref&gt; He held a weekly Bible class in Miami and published several religiously themed books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Florida Memory |title=William Jennings Bryan Conducting a Bible Class in Royal Palm Park - Miami, Florida |url=https://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/23949 |accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first individuals to preach religious faith on the [[radio]], reaching audiences across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 271–272&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan welcomed the proliferation of faiths other than Protestant Christianity, but he was deeply concerned by the rejection of [[Biblical literalism]] by many Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Ronald L. Numbers]], Bryan was not nearly as much a [[fundamentalist]] as many modern-day [[creationist]]s of the 21st century. Instead he is more accurately described as a "[[day-age creationist]]".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Ronald L. Numbers, ''[[The Creationists]]: From Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design'', (2006), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Bradley J. Longfield posits Bryan was "theologically conservative social gospeler".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Longfield |first1=Bradley J. |title=The Presbyterian Controversy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k3Q8DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=bradley+j+longfield+theologically+conservative+social+gospeler&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPtbX72fTcAhUC54MKHeCJDrMQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bradley%20j%20longfield%20theologically%20conservative%20social%20gospeler&amp;f=false |accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final years of his life, Bryan became the unofficial leader of a movement that sought to prevent [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] from being taught in public schools.&lt;ref name="kazin262263"/&gt; Bryan had long expressed skepticism and concern regarding Darwin's theory; in his famous 1909 Chautauqua lecture, "The Prince of Peace", Bryan had warned that the theory of evolution could undermine the foundations of morality.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[https://archive.org/stream/princeofpeace00brya#page/n7/mode/2up The Prince of Peace]''&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan opposed Darwin's theory of evolution through [[natural selection]] for two reasons. First, he believed that what he considered a materialistic account of the descent of man (and all life) through evolution was directly contrary to the Biblical creation account. Second, he considered [[Darwinism]] as applied to society ([[social Darwinism]]) to be a great evil force in the world, promoting hatred and conflicts and inhibiting upward social and economic mobility of the poor and oppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Coletta, (1969, Vol. 3), ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ChasW+WmJBryan.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Charles W. Bryan|Charles W.]] and William J. Bryan]]

As part of his crusade against Darwinism, Bryan called for state and local laws banning public schools from teaching evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 274–275&lt;/ref&gt; He requested that lawmakers refrain from attaching a criminal penalty to the anti-evolution laws, and also urged that educators be allowed to teach evolution as a "hypothesis" rather than as a fact. Only five states, all of them located in the South, responded to Bryan's call to bar the teaching of evolution in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 280–281&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryan was worried that the theory of evolution was gaining ground not only in the universities, but also within the church. The developments of 19th century [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]], and [[higher criticism]] in particular, had allowed many clergymen to be willing to embrace the theory of evolution and claim that it was not contradictory with their being Christians. Determined to put an end to this, Bryan, who had long served as a Presbyterian [[Elder (religious)|elder]], decided to run for the position of [[Moderator of the General Assembly]] of the Presbyterian Church in the USA, which was at the time embroiled in the [[Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy]]. Bryan's main competition in the race was the Rev. [[Charles F. Wishart]], president of the [[College of Wooster]] in Ohio, who had loudly endorsed the teaching of the theory of evolution in the college. Bryan lost to Wishart by a vote of 451–427. Bryan failed in gaining approval for a proposal to cut off funds to schools where the theory of evolution was taught. Instead, the General Assembly announced disapproval of materialistic (as opposed to theistic) evolution.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====Scopes Trial====
{{Further|Scopes Trial}}
[[File:Ruth Bryan Owen.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Congresswoman [[Ruth Bryan Owen]], Bryan's daughter]]

In 1925, Bryan participated in the highly publicized [[Scopes Trial]], which tested the [[Butler Act]], a Tennessee law barring the teaching of evolution in public schools. The defendant, [[John T. Scopes]], had violated the Butler Act while serving as a substitute biology teacher in [[Dayton, Tennessee]]. His defense was funded by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and led in court by famed lawyer [[Clarence Darrow]]. No one disputed that Scopes had violated the Butler Act, but Darrow argued that the statute violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. Bryan defended the right of parents to choose what schools teach, argued that Darwinism was merely a "hypothesis," and claimed that Darrow and other intellectuals were trying to invalidate "every moral standard that the Bible gives us."&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 285–288&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense called Bryan as a witness and asked him about his belief in the literal word of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 292–293&lt;/ref&gt; "Asked when the Flood occurred, Bryan consulted ''[[Ussher chronology|Ussher's Bible Concordance]]'', and gave the date as 2348 BC, or 4,273 years ago. Did not Bryan know, asked Darrow, that [[History of China|Chinese civilization]] had been traced back at least 7,000 years? Bryan conceded that he did not. When he was asked if the records of any other religion made mention of a flood at the time he cited, Bryan replied: "The Christian religion has always been good enough for me—I never found it necessary to study any competing religion.' "&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Y. Anderson]], "Sad Death of a Hero," ''[[American Mercury]]'', v. 37, no. 147 (March 1936) 293–301.&lt;/ref&gt; The judge expunged Bryan's testimony and instructed the jury to render a verdict of guilty; Scopes was fined $100 for violating the Butler Act.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 293–295&lt;/ref&gt;

The national media reported the trial in great detail, with [[H. L. Mencken]] ridiculing Bryan as a symbol of Southern ignorance and [[anti-intellectualism]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Even many Southern newspapers criticized Bryan's performance in the trial; the ''Memphis Commercial Appeal'' reported that "Darrow succeeded in showing that Bryan knows little about the science of the world." Bryan had not been allowed to deliver a final argument at trial, but he arranged for the publication of the speech he had intended to give. In that publication, Bryan wrote that "science is a magnificent material force, but it is not a teacher of morals."&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 294–295&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

In days following the Scopes Trial, Bryan delivered several speeches in Tennessee. On Sunday, July 26, 1925, Bryan died in his sleep after attending a church service in Dayton.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan's body was transported by rail from Dayton to Washington, D.C. He was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], with an epitaph that read "Statesman. Yet Friend To Truth! Of Soul Sincere. In Action Faithful. And In Honor Clear"&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 296–297&lt;/ref&gt; and on the other side "He kept the faith"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Find a Grave |title=William Jennings Bryan Find a Grave Memorial |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/141/william-jennings-bryan |accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
[[File:WmJBryan+wife.jpg|thumb|William Jennings Bryan and wife Mary in [[New York City]], June 19, 1915]]

Bryan remained married to his wife, Mary, until his death in 1925. Mary served as an important adviser to her husband; she passed the bar exam and learned German in order to help his career.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 14, 296&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried next to Bryan after her death in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9058097/mary-elizabeth-bryan&lt;/ref&gt; William and Mary had three children: [[Ruth Bryan Owen|Ruth]], William Jr., and Grace. Ruth won election to Congress in 1928, and later served as the ambassador to Denmark during the presidency of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].&lt;ref name="kazin300301"&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 300–301&lt;/ref&gt; William Jr. graduated from [[Georgetown Law]] and established a legal practice in [[Los Angeles]]. Grace also moved to [[Southern California]] and wrote a biography of her father. William Jr. held several federal positions and emerged as an important figure in the Los Angeles Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 266–267, 300–301&lt;/ref&gt; William's brother, Charles, was an important supporter of his brother until William's death, as well as an influential politician in his own right. Charles served two terms as the mayor of Lincoln, three terms as the governor of Nebraska, and was the Democratic vice presidential nominee in the [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===Historical reputation and political legacy===
[[File:williamjenningsbryanstatue.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Bryan on the lawn of the [[Rhea County, Tennessee]] courthouse in [[Dayton, Tennessee]]]]

Bryan elicited mixed views during his lifetime, and his legacy remains complicated.&lt;ref name="lrothman1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rothman |first1=Lily |title=The Man Steve Bannon Compared to President Trump, as Described in 1925 |url=http://time.com/4681697/steve-bannon-donald-trump-william-jennings-bryan/ |accessdate=2 August 2018 |publisher=Time |date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Scott Farris argues that "many fail to understand Bryan because he occupies a rare space in society ... too liberal for today's religious [and] too religious for today's liberals."&lt;ref&gt;Farris (2013), pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Taylor rejects the view that Bryan was a "pioneer of the [[welfare state]]" and a "forerunner of the [[New Deal]]," but argues that Bryan was more accepting of an interventionist federal government than his Democratic predecessors had been.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2006), pp. 187–188&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Michael Kazin]], however, opines that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bryan was the first leader of a major party to argue for permanently expanding the power of the federal government to serve the welfare of ordinary Americans from the working and middle classes ... he did more than any other man—between the fall of Grover Cleveland and the election of Woodrow Wilson—to transform his party from a bulwark of laissez-faire to the citadel of liberalism we identify with Franklin D. Roosevelt and his ideological descendants.&lt;ref name="kazinxix"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kazin argues that, compared to Bryan, "only Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson had a greater impact on politics and political culture during the era of reform that began in the mid-1890s and lasted until the early 1920s."&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1931, former Secretary of the Treasury [[William Gibbs McAdoo]] stated that "with the exception of the men who have occupied the White House, Bryan ... had more to do with the shaping of the public policies of the last forty years than any other American citizen."&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Robert D. Johnston notes that Bryan was "arguably [the] most influential politician from the [[Great Plains]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnston |first1=Robert D. |title="There's No 'There' There": Reflections on Western Political Historiography |journal=Western Historical Quarterly |date=2011 |volume=42 |issue=3 |page=334 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/westhistquar.42.3.0331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, political scientist Michael G. Miller and historian Ken Owen ranked Bryan as one of the most four most influential American politicians who never served as president, alongside [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[Henry Clay]], and [[John C. Calhoun]].&lt;ref name="smasket1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Masket |first1=Seth |title=A bracket to determine the most influential American who never became president |url=https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2015/11/19/9760888/most-influential-non-president |accessdate=1 August 2018 |publisher=Vox |date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazin also emphasizes the limits of Bryan's influence, noting that "for decades after [Bryan]'s death, influential scholars and journalists depicted him as a self-righteous simpleton who longed to preserve an age that had already passed."&lt;ref name="kazinxix"/&gt; Writing in 2006, editor Richard Lingeman noted that "William Jennings Bryan is mainly remembered as the fanatical old fool [[Fredric March]] played in ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lingeman |first1=Richard |title=The Man With the Silver Tongue |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/05/books/review/the-man-with-the-silver-tongue.html |publisher=New York Times |date=5 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 2011, John McDermott wrote that "Bryan is perhaps best known as the sweaty crank of a lawyer who represented Tennessee in the Scopes trial. After his defence of creationism, he became a mocked caricature, a sweaty possessor of avoirdupois, bereft of bombast."&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite news |last1=McDermott |first1=John |title=The life of Bryan, or what did monetary policy ever do for us? |url=https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2011/08/19/656016/the-life-of-bryan-or-what-did-monetary-policy-ever-do-for-us/ |publisher=Financial Times |date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kazin writes that "scholars have increasingly warmed to Bryan's motives, if not his actions" in the Scopes Trial, due to Bryan's rejection of [[eugenics]], a practice that many evolutionists of the 1920s favored.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazin also notes the stain that Bryan's acceptance of the Jim Crow system places on his legacy, writing

&lt;blockquote&gt;His one great flaw was to support, with a studied lack of reflection, the abusive system of Jim Crow—a view that was shared, until the late 1930s, by nearly every white Democrat ... After Bryan's death in 1925, most intellectuals and activists on the broad left rejected the amalgam that had inspired him: a strict populist morality based on a close read reading of Scripture ... Liberals and radicals from the age of FDR to the present have tended to scorn that credo as naïve and bigoted, a remnant of an era of white Protestant supremacy that has, or should have, passed.&lt;ref name="kazinxix"&gt;Kazin (2006), p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nonetheless, prominent individuals from both parties have praised Bryan and his legacy. In 1962, former President [[Harry Truman]] said Bryan "was a great one—one of the greatest."  Truman also claimed: "If it wasn't for old Bill Bryan, there wouldn't be any liberalism at all in the country now. Bryan kept liberalism alive, he kept it going."&lt;ref&gt;Merle Miller, pp. 118–19&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=July 2018}} [[Tom L. Johnson]], the progressive mayor of [[Cleveland, Ohio]], referred to Bryan's campaign in 1896 as "the first great struggle of the masses in our country against the privileged classes."{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In a 1934 speech dedicating a memorial to Bryan, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] said 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think that we would choose the word 'sincerity' as fitting him [Bryan] most of all ... it was that sincerity that served him so well in his life-long fight against sham and privilege and wrong. It was that sincerity which made him a force for good in his own generation and kept alive many of the ancient faiths on which we are building today. We ... can well agree that he fought the good fight; that he finished the course; and that he kept the faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=14861|title=Franklin D. Roosevelt: Address at a Memorial to William Jennings Bryan.|work=ucsb.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More recently, conservative Republicans such as [[Ralph Reed]] have hailed Bryan's legacy; Reed described Bryan as "the most consequential evangelical politician of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (2006), p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan's career has also frequently been compared to that of [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name="lrothman1"/&gt;

===In popular culture===

[[Inherit the Wind (play)|''Inherit the Wind'']], a 1955 play by [[Jerome Lawrence]] and [[Robert Edwin Lee]], is a highly fictionalized account of the Scopes Trial written in response to [[McCarthyism]]. A populist thrice-defeated presidential candidate from Nebraska named Matthew Harrison Brady (based on Bryan) comes to a small town to help prosecute a young teacher for teaching evolution to his schoolchildren. He is opposed by a famous trial lawyer, Henry Drummond (based on Darrow), and mocked by a cynical newspaperman (based on H.L. Mencken) as the trial assumes a national profile. A 1960 [[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Hollywood film adaptation]], written by the playwrights, was directed by [[Stanley Kramer]] and stars [[Spencer Tracy]] as lawyer Henry Drummond and [[Fredric March]] as Matthew Harrison Brady.

[[L. Frank Baum]] satirized Bryan as the [[Cowardly Lion]] in [[Political interpretations of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'']], published in 1900. Baum had been a Republican activist in 1896 and wrote on McKinley's behalf.&lt;ref name="John G 2004 Pages 59 - 63"&gt;John G. Geer and Thomas R.

Bryan also has a biographical part in "The 42nd Parallel" in [[John Dos Passos]]' ''[[USA Trilogy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dos Passos, John (1896–1970). ''U.S.A.'' Daniel Aaron &amp; Townsend Ludington, eds. New York: Library of America, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vachel Lindsay]]'s "singing poem" "[[Bryan, Bryan, Bryan, Bryan]]" is a lengthy tribute to the idol of the poet's youth. The actor [[Ainslie Pryor]] played Bryan in a 1956 episode of the [[CBS]] [[anthology series]] ''[[You Are There (series)|You Are There]]''. The short story [[Alternate Presidents|"Plowshare"]] by [[Martha Soukup]] and part of the novel ''[[Job: A Comedy of Justice]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] are set in worlds where Bryan became president. Bryan also appears in ''[[And Having Writ]]'' by [[Donald R. Bensen]].

===Memorials===

The [[William Jennings Bryan House (Lincoln, Nebraska)|William Jennings Bryan House]] in Nebraska was named a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1963. The Bryan Home Museum is a by-appointment only museum at his birthplace in Salem, Illinois. Salem is also home to Bryan Park and a large statue of Bryan. His home at [[Asheville, North Carolina]], from 1917 to 1920, the [[William Jennings Bryan House (Asheville, North Carolina)|William Jennings Bryan House]], was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a|dateform=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Villa Serena]], Bryan's property in [[Miami, Florida]], is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

A [[William Jennings Bryan (Evans)|statue of Bryan]] represents the state of Nebraska at the [[National Statuary Hall]] in the [[United States Capitol]], as part of the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]]. Bryan was named to the [[Nebraska Hall of Fame]] in 1971, and a bust of him resides in the [[Nebraska State Capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/admin/hall_of_fame/inductees.htm|title=Nebraska Hall of Fame Members|work=nebraskahistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan was honored by the [[United States Postal Service]] with a $2 [[Great Americans series]] [[postage stamp]].

Numerous objects, places, and people have been named after Bryan, including [[Bryan County, Oklahoma]],&lt;ref name="okhs-bryan-county"&gt;Oklahoma Historical Society. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v002/v002p075.html "Origin of County Names in Oklahoma"], ''Chronicles of Oklahoma'' 2:1 (March 1924) 7582 (retrieved August 18, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bryan Health|Bryan Medical Center]] in Lincoln, Nebraska, and [[Bryan College]], located in [[Dayton, Tennessee]]. [[Omaha Bryan High School]] and Bryan Middle School in Bellevue, Nebraska are also named for Bryan. During World War II the [[Liberty ship]] {{SS|William J.

'''Workplace democracy''' is the application of [[democracy]] in all its forms (including voting systems, debates, democratic structuring, due process, adversarial process, systems of appeal) to the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Rayasam, Renuka (24 April 2008). Democracy Can Be Good Business". U.S. News &amp; World Report. Retrieved 16 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplace democracy is implemented in a variety of ways, dependent on the size, culture, and other variables of an organization. Workplace democracy can be anything from direct democracy to employers asking opinions of employees without taking into consideration their beliefs and opinions.&lt;ref name="williams1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://learning-in-action.williams.edu/breaking-the-mold/the-case-of-marland-mold |title=The Case of Marland Mold – Center for Learning in Action |publisher=Learning-in-action.williams.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages/Arguments for== 

'''Economic argument'''

From as early as the 1920s, scholars have been exploring the idea of increasing employee participation and involvement. They sought to learn if whether including employees in organizational decision-making would lead to increased effectiveness and productivity within the organization. According to Lewin, individuals who are involved in decision-making also have increased openness to change&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/017084069401500202&lt;/ref&gt; Different participative techniques can have either a stronger impact on morale than productivity, while others have the reverse effect. Success of the employee-owned and operated, [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon]], suggests economic benefits from workplace democracy.  

'''Citizenship argument'''

Workplace democracy acts as an agent to encourage public participation in a government's political process. Skills developed from democracy in the workplace can transfer to improved citizenship and result in a better functioning democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1988/A1988P684300001.pdf |title=Bachrach P. The theory of democratic elitism: a critique. Boston, MA. Little, Brown 1967. 109 p. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers in a democratic environment may also develop a greater concern from the common good, which also transfers to fundamental citizenship. 

'''Ethical justification'''

Making workplaces more democratic is the "right" thing to do. Philosopher [[Robert Dahl]] claims that 'if democracy is justified in governing the state, it must also be justified in governing economic enterprises' &lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0951692890002001005&lt;/ref&gt;.   

'''Employee power and representation''' 

Workers working for democratic leaders report positive results such as group member satisfaction, friendliness, group mindedness, 'we' statements, worker motivation, creativity, and dedication to decisions made within an organization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Northouse, P. G. (2015). Introduction to leadership: Concepts and practice (3rd ed). Kalamazoo, MI: SAGE Publications. 978-1-4833-1276-7&lt;/ref&gt;

When workplace democracy is used the effect typically is raised employee potential, employee representation, higher [[autonomy]], and equal power within an organization (Rolfsen, 2011).

==Political association==
Workplace democracy theory closely follows political democracy, especially in larger workplaces. Democratic workplace organization is often associated with [[trade unions]], [[Anarchism|anarchist,]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] movements. Most unions have democratic structures at least for selecting the leader, and sometimes these are seen as providing the only democratic aspects to the workplace. However, not every workplace that lacks a union lacks democracy, and not every workplace that has a union necessarily has a democratic way to resolve disputes &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author=G. William Domhoff |url=https://whorulesamerica.ucsc.edu/power/history_of_labor_unions.html |title=Who Rules America: The Rise and Fall of Labor Unions in the U.S |publisher=Whorulesamerica.ucsc.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, some unions have been more committed to workplace democracy than others. The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] pioneered the archetypal workplace democracy model, the Wobbly Shop, in which recallable delegates were elected by workers, and other norms of grassroots democracy were applied. This is still used in some organizations, notably Semco and in the software industry.

Spanish anarchists, Mohandas Gandhi's Swadeshi movement, farm and retail co-operative movements, all made contributions to the theory and practice of workplace democracy and often carried that into the political arena as a "more participatory democracy." The [[Green party|Green parties]] worldwide have adopted workplace democracy as a central platform, and also often mimic workplace democracy norms such as gender equity, co-leadership, deliberative democracy applied to any major decision, and leaders who don't do policy. The [[Democratic socialism|Democratic socialist parties]] have supported the notion of workplace democracy and democratically controlled institutions.

The best known and most studied example of a successfully democratic national labor union in the United States are the [[United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} known throughout the labor movement as the UE. An independent trade Union, the UE was built from the bottom-up, and takes pride in its motto that "The Members Run This Union!" &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;.

In Sweden, the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] made laws and reforms from 1950-70 to establish more democratic workplaces.

[[Salvador Allende]] championed a large number of such experiments in Chile before his assassination on September 11, 1973.

==Studies by management science==
There are many management science papers on the application of democratic structuring to the workplace, and its benefits. One such international study of more than 50 different democratic companies discovered that a minimum of six specific organizational components (including political, economic, psychological and juridical processes) were all equally necessary if the democratic functioning of management systems was to last over the long term &lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Paul (2012). Workplace Democratization: Its Internal Dynamics. Chelsea, MA: Educational Services Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;.

Benefits are often contrasted to simple [[command hierarchy]] arrangements in which "the boss" can hire anyone and fire anyone, and takes absolute and total responsibility for his own well-being and also all that occurs "under" him. The command hierarchy is a preferred management style followed in many companies for its simplicity, speed and low process overheads.

London Business School chief, Nigel Nicholson, in his 1998 [[Harvard Business]] Review paper: "How Hardwired is Human Behavior?" suggested that human nature was just as likely to cause problems in the workplace as in larger social and political settings, and that similar methods were required to deal with stressful situations and difficult problems. He held up the workplace democracy model advanced by Ricardo Semler as the "only" one that actually took cognizance of human foibles &lt;ref&gt;https://hbr.org/1998/07/how-hardwired-is-human-behavior&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Influenced matrix management===
Managerial grid models and matrix management, compromises between true workplace democracy and conventional top-down hierarchy, became common in the 1990s. These models cross responsibilities so that no one manager had total control of any one employee, or so that technical and marketing management were not subordinated to each other but had to argue out their concerns more mutually. A consequence of this was the rise of learning organization theory, in which the ontology of definitions in common among all factions or professions becomes the main management problem.

==Current approaches==
===Limits on management===
Many{{quantify|date=June 2018}} organizations began by the 1960s to realize that tight control by too few people was encouraging [[groupthink]], increasing turnover in staff and a loss of morale among qualified people helpless to appeal what they saw as misguided, uninformed, or poorly thought-out decisions. Often{{quantify|date=June 2018}} employees who publicly criticize such poor decision making of their higher management are penalized or even fired from their jobs on some false pretext or other. The comic strip ''[[Dilbert]]'' has become popular satirizing this type of oblivious management, iconically represented by the [[Pointy-haired Boss]], a nameless and clueless social climber. The [[Dilbert principle]] has been accepted as fact by some.{{by whom?|date=June 2018}}

Much [[management philosophy]] has focused on trying to limit manager power, differentiate [[leadership]] versus management, and so on. Henry Mintzberg, Peter Drucker and Donella Meadows were three very notable theorists addressing these concerns in the 1980s. Mintzberg and Drucker studied how executives spent their time, Meadows how change and leverage to resist it existed at all levels in all kinds of organizations.

[[Adhocracy]], [[functional leadership model]]s and [[business process reengineering | reengineering]] were all attempts to detect and remove administrative incompetence. Business process and quality management methods in general remove managerial flexibility that is often perceived as masking managerial mistakes, but also preventing transparency and facilitating fraud, as in [[Enron scandal | the case of Enron]]. Had managers been more accountable to employees, it is argued,{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} owners and employees would not have been defrauded.

=== Codetermination ===
{{main | Codetermination in Germany}}

[[German law]] specifically mandates[[Codetermination in Germany | democratic worker participation]] in the oversight of larger workplaces.

=== Examples of companies organized by workplace democracy ===

====Mondragon====
The [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon Cooperative Corporation]] is the largest worker cooperative in the world, and as such the largest corporation that operates some form of workplace democracy.

====Marland Mold====
Marland Mold was a company started in 1946 in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, by Severino Marchetto and Paul Ferland. The company at first, designed and built steel molds for plastic products throughout the 1950's and 60's. In 1969 the owners sold the company to VCA which was later bought by The Ethyl Corporation. The Marland Mold employees voted to join a [[International Union of Electrical Workers]], because of a dispute that took place over health insurance. The plant's manager started to pay less attention and put less time into the Pittsfield plant so the profits declined. The plant was put up for sale in 1992. The employees ended up buying out the plant, even though they weren't fans of employee ownership before, they needed to save their jobs. There immediately was a burst in production and they were able to produce molds that normally took the 3000 hours to make in 2200 hours. They had financial stake in the company now which gave them new motivation for the company's success. The other two ideas that were key components to their success was the education of all members about their new roles, and building an ownership culture within the organization. In 1995, they had officially bought all ownership stock and buyout lenders and the company was completely employee owned. Through all of this employees were also able to gain a broader perspective on the company, like being able to understand others views of different conflicts in the workplace. In 2007, Marland Mold celebrated their 15th anniversary of employee ownership &lt;ref name="williams1"/&gt;.

====Semco====
In the 1980s, [[Brazil]]ian businessman [[Ricardo Semler]], converted his family firm, a light manufacturing concern called Semco, and transformed it into a strictly democratic establishment where managers were interviewed and then elected by workers. All managerial decisions were subject to democratic review, debate and vote, with the full participation of all workers. This radical approach to management got him and the company a great deal of attention. Semler argued that handing the company over to the workers was the only way to free time for himself to go build up the customer, government and other relationships required to make the company grow. By literally giving up the fight to hold any control of internals, Semler was able to focus on marketing, positioning, and offer his advice (as a paid, elected spokesman, though his position as major shareholder was not so negotiable) as if he were, effectively, an outside management consultant hired by the company. Decentralization of management functions, he claimed, gave him a combination of insider information and outsider credibility, plus the legitimacy of truly speaking for his workers in the same sense as an elected political leader.&lt;ref name="mallenbaker1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mallenbaker.net/article/inspiring-people/ricardo-semler-the-radical-boss-who-proved-that-workplace-democracy-works |title=Ricardo Semler: The radical boss who proved that workplace democracy works &amp;#124; Mallen Baker's Respectful Business Blog |publisher=Mallenbaker.net |date=2017-01-03 |accessdate=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mallenbaker1"/&gt;

'''Ziyad Baroud''' ({{lang-ar|زياد بارود}} {{IPAc-en|audio=Ar-lb-ZiyadBaroud.ogg|z|iː|ˈ|j|æ|d|_|b|ɑː|ˈ|r|uː|d}}; born 29 April 1970) is a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] civil servant and [[civil society]] activist. He served as minister of interior and municipalities, considered to be one of the most powerful positions in the country, from 2008 to 2011 for two consecutive cabinets in both [[Fuad Siniora]] and [[Saad Hariri]]'s governments.

Owing in large part to his industrious work ethics, his unchanged middle-class status and his political impartiality, Ziyad Baroud is widely considered to be one of the most popular politicians in the country today. Baroud is also one of the few political personalities who is appreciated by both ends of the rivaled Lebanese political clan and thus, subsequently holds good esteem with many of the personas across the complex and contentious [[list of political parties in Lebanon|Lebanese political spectrum]].

An attorney by formation and practice, Baroud is an expert on issues of [[decentralization]] and [[electoral law]] reform. He is known to abstain from engaging in feudal politics, and to focus instead on building the Lebanese [[civil society]] and Lebanese [[civil institutions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArchiveDetails.aspx?ID=261936 Reaching Lebanon’s Disenfranchised Majority.] (15 April 2011). In ''Now Lebanon''. Retrieved on 9 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; During his mandate as minister of interior, Baroud was credited for pushing forward a culture of responsibility and openness where he made himself easily accessible to all Lebanese citizens eager to share complaints and/or opinions, and was widely present in day-to-day activities of his subordinates. His actions resulted in an unpremeditated cultivation of a very attractive public image that he still possesses today.

Baroud was also credited with overseeing Lebanon's best-managed round of elections to date in [[Lebanese elections 2009|2009]], which he orchestrated in one day instead of the conventional four weekends, a record in Lebanese history. This has earned him the First Prize of the prestigious [[United Nations Public Service Awards|United Nations Public Service Award]] where Lebanon was ranked first among 400 government administrations from all over the world by the [[United Nations Public Administration Network]] (UNPAN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.undp.org.lb/communication/news/NewsDetail.cfm?newsId=220 |title=H.E.

On 26 May 2011, Baroud resigned from office as minister of interior and municipalities in Saad Hariri's government after an inter-party conflict developed between the [[Internal Security Forces]] and the Ministry of [[Telecommunications in Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2011/May-27/Lebanons-Arabic-press-digest].

Ziyad Baroud has been granted several awards to date, in 2010 he was the recipient of the [[International Foundation for Electoral Systems|International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES)]] [[Charles T.

(12 May 2012). In ''Société des Membres de la Légion d'Honneur – Liban''. Retrieved 9 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Ziyad Baroud was born on 29 April 1970 in [[Jeita]], [[Keserwan District|Keserwan]] into [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] family of Selim and Antoinette (née Salem). The first of two children, Baroud and his younger sister Maha were brought up in a middle-class civil household with no political ancestry, where both parents were high school teachers; their father a senior grade mathematics teacher and their mother an Arabic literature teacher. Baroud completed his high school education at [[Collège Saint Joseph - Antoura|Collège Saint Joseph – Antoura des Pères Lazaristes]] from which he graduated in 1988. He then attended the Faculty of Law at [[Saint Joseph University]] in [[Beirut]] from which he earned his Master's Degree in Law. He was admitted to the Beirut Bar Association in 1993.

From 1993 to 1996, Baroud worked as a trainee lawyer in [[Beirut]] in the cabinet of [[Ibrahim Najjar]], who later served as minister of justice in the same government as Baroud. While working in the office of Najjar, Baroud contributed along with a handful of judges and fellow lawyers to the drafting of a legal monthly supplement in [[An-Nahar]] "Houqouq Annas" (Ar: حقوق الناس) or "People's Rights", the first of its kind, designed to familiarize people with judiciary rights and jargon and promote the implementation and modernization of Lebanese laws with the aim of bringing more justice to society. At the same time, Baroud was pursuing doctoral studies at the [[Paris X|University of Paris X]] in Paris, France, a school that also graduated [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and [[Dominique de Villepin]] among other influential personalities. Baroud is currently preparing his [[doctoral thesis]] on the subject of '''"Decentralization in Lebanon after the Taif Agreement"''', a topic that is one of his main subjects of expertise as well as one of the major lobbying points of his political agenda.

==Career and policymaking activities==
Baroud held a number of academic posts as lecturer in two prestigious universities in Lebanon:  His alma mater [[Saint Joseph University|Université Saint Joseph]] (USJ) and [[Universite Saint-Esprit de Kaslik|Université Saint-Esprit de Kaslik]] (USEK). Furthermore, he sits today on the [[Board of Trustees]] of [[Notre Dame University – Louaize|Notre Dame University]].

With time, Baroud became more and more involved in key public actions that took him to the forefront of national, high-profile [[political activism]], largely due to his expertise on many impending national topics, notably electoral law, decentralization and the constitution.

'''Electoral reform'''

Ziyad Baroud is one of the staunchest and most active experts on electoral law reform in Lebanon. 
In March 1996, Baroud founded along with other activists the [http://www.lade.org.lb Lebanese Association for Democratic Elections] (LADE), an independent, nonprofit organization specialized in the study of elections and electoral laws' impact on democracy. The subject of elections and electoral law reform will become another forte of Ziyad Baroud's life and political agenda. 
In 2004, Baroud was elected Secretary General of LADE to lead a group of more than 1,300 domestic electoral observers during the 2005 elections.  
In 2006, he was chosen to serve as a board member of the Lebanese chapter of Transparency International (LTA). 
In 2005–2006, he was commissioned by the Prime Minister of the Republic [[Fuad Siniora]] along with eleven others to serve on a [[blue-ribbon panel|blue-ribbon commission]] headed by Former Minister [[Fouad Boutros]] to propose a draft for electoral law reform, this commission came to be familiarly known as the "Boutros Commission".

:'''''The Boutros Commission'''''
: 
:In 2005, the new cabinet headed by Prime Minister [[Fuad Siniora]] launched an independent commission on 8 August 2005 headed by Former [[Foreign Minister]] [[Fouad Boutros]] to study the dire issue of the 2000 electoral law and propose a change. The commission was named the "Lebanese National Commission on Electoral Law", more casually known as the "Boutros Commission." Twelve people, six Muslims and six Christians, were appointed, of which Baroud was chosen to be one of the key expert members. Other members included: [[Fouad Boutros]] (President), Ghaleb Mahmassany, Michel Tabet, [[Zouheir Chokr]], Ghassan Abou Alwan, [[Nawaf Salam]], Abdel Salam Sheaib, Fayez Al-Hajj Shahine, Paul Salem, Khaldoun Naja, and Arda Ekmekji.  
: 
:The commission met for nine months and delivered a [https://web.archive.org/web/20110626013210/http://www.transparency-lebanon.org/publications/boutrosdraftguideen.pdf 129-article draft law] for comprehensive electoral reform to the cabinet on 31 May 2006. The 129 articles detailed a myriad of reforms including lowering the [[voting age]] to 18 years, implementing an electoral list quota of 30% female candidates, an assessment of [[absentee balloting]] for Lebanese abroad, and the implementation of comprehensive and tight regulations for [[political campaigns]] and their financial spendings, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparency-lebanon.org/publications/boutrosdraftguideen.pdf A Guide to the Proposed Draft Law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626013210/http://www.transparency-lebanon.org/publications/boutrosdraftguideen.pdf |date=26 June 2011 }}. (2007). In ''The Lebanese Transparency Association''. Retrieved 12 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
: 
:Unfortunately, the cabinet ran out of time before it had a chance to vote on the Boutros Commission's proposal. Five weeks later, the [[July War]] broke out in July 2006 before the law could be sent to parliament. The subsequent deterioration of the political situation and closing of the legislature prevented any proposed reforms from being addressed, and remained pending.

'''Decentralization'''

Baroud worked as a research associate at the [http://www.lcps-lebanon.org "Lebanese Center for Policy Studies"], a Beirut-based think tank of which he is a board member today. LCPS aims to provide researched, politically neutral guidelines to serve policymaking. Baroud also consulted with the [[UNDP]] on local governance and decentralization from 2001 to 2008. He is currently the chairman of the "Governmental Committee of Decentralization" (Ar: اللجنة الخاصة باللامركزية), knowing that the topic of decentralization happens to be his Doctorate Thesis subject.

==Minister of the interior and municipalities==

Following [[2008 fighting in Lebanon|the deadly clashes of May 2008]], on 21 May 2008, figures from both the opposition and majority signed the [[Doha Agreement]] under the auspices of Qatar's foreign minister and prime minister [[Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani|Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani]], finally diffusing an 18-month crisis. The Doha negotiations resulted in the long-awaited election of General [[Michel Sleiman]] as President of the Lebanese Republic and the formation of the 70th national unity government led by Prime Minister [[Fouad Siniora|Fuad Siniora]], composed of 30 ministers distributed among the majority (16 ministers), the opposition (11 ministers) and the president (3 ministers).

Ziyad Baroud, who had been engaged in serious national struggles for democratization for over 15 years, stood out as a professional and committed civil society activist. Newly elected President [[Michel Sleiman]] consequently named Ziyad Baroud as [[Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (Lebanon)|Minister of Interior and Municipalities]].

Baroud served as [[Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (Lebanon)|Minister of Interior and Municipalities]] under two consecutive cabinets. The first cabinet led by Prime Minister [[Fouad Siniora|Fuad Siniora]] in the 70th national unity government which lasted from 11 July 2008, until November 2009. Baroud successively served for a second term under Prime Minister [[Saad Hariri]]'s [[Lebanese government of November 2009|cabinet]] which lasted from 9 Nov 2009 to 13 June 2011, though he had resigned on 26 May 2011.

As [[Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (Lebanon)|Minister of Interior and Municipalities]] in [[Lebanese government of July 2008|Fuad Siniora's government]], Baroud occupied one of the toughest and most high profile jobs in the country and was able to set a very high record of positive changes within many of the country's sectors.

===Enforcing traffic laws===

The first crackdown Baroud orchestrated was on traffic disobedience. Working closely with NGOs that promote road safety and injury prevention, notably the ''Youth Association for Social Awareness'' (YASA) and ''[[Kunhadi|Kun Hadi]]'' (Arabic for "Be Calm", as well as a play on the word "Hadi" which is the name of a young man who died in a speeding car accident and namesake of the organization), one of Baroud's first undertakings as minister was to impose traffic laws, including seatbelt enforcement and speed limits compliance. 
Resultantly, under his mandate, in the first year alone, the Ministry of Interior raised the number of traffic officers from 593 to 1,800.&lt;ref&gt;[https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/nownews/baroud_promises_traffic_law_enforcement_ Baroud promises traffic law enforcement]. (7 December 2009). In ''Now Lebanon''. Retrieved 10 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
87% of motorists started complying with traffic lights. 
32,323 illegal motorcycles were confiscated. 
A decline of 77% in car thefts was recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/Jan/16/ISF-announces-drop-in-crime-rates-across-country.ashx#axzz2HXufq6Y5 ISF announces drop in crime rates across country].

All of the above were records in the history of the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoIM).

''[[Time magazine]]'' published an article citing the importance of Baroud's undertakings regarding traffic laws: “Unable to solve the big problems facing the country, Ziad Baroud, Suleiman's choice to lead the powerful Ministry of the Interior, began focusing on problems that might actually make a difference in the lives of average Lebanese. In particular, the police began cracking down on the single biggest cause of death in the country: not terrorism, or war, but traffic accidents.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1892260,00.html#ixzz1zPtqYetW Can a Broken-Windows Policy Work in Lebanon?]. Butters, Andrew Lee. (19 April 2009). In ''TIME Magazine''. Retrieved 9 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supporting Freedom of Association===
Being an avid civil society activist and a human rights campaigner, Baroud has been known to support and actively encourage the work of Lebanon's Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). Thus, a major undertaking tackled by Baroud was signing off on counts of registration applications from NGOs that had been stacking up for years and never accorded registration permits. Baroud released a circular facilitating the registration of NGOs. The number of NGOs approved under Baroud rates as one of the highest in the history of the Interior Ministry.

===Privacy of Religious Identity===
Baroud is the first government official to ever officially give freedom of choice to Lebanese citizens about revealing their religious affiliation on civil registry documents. Although [[Lebanese identity card|Lebanese new identification cards]] issued post-civil war do not state citizens’ religious affiliation, individual civil registry records still maintained the obligation for religious disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7906125.stm Lebanon 'moves right way' on ID]. (24 February 2009). In ''BBC''. Retrieved 12 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroud thus issued a circular in February 2009 decreeing that every Lebanese citizen was now free to cross out his/her religious identity from all official documents, and replace it with a slash sign (/) if they desire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=30381 Lebanon moves to tackle religious discrimination].

===Monitoring of the "best managed elections" to date===
For several years, the [http://www.ccerlebanon.org/ Civil Campaign for Electoral Reform] (CCER), a broad alliance for civil society associations founded in 2005 by Baroud among others, was demanding that the parliament hold parliamentary elections over the course of one day. Although the Administration and Justice parliamentarian commission wanted to try and hold the 2009 elections over two days for security reasons, Baroud made great efforts to resolve all logistical difficulties in order to hold the elections in one day.

The 2009 Parliamentary Elections were consequently held over the course of one day, on 7 June 2009. The [[March 14 Alliance]] beat the opposition bloc of the [[March 8 Alliance]] winning 71 seats in the 128-member parliament to 57 seats going to the latter. This result is virtually the same as the result from the 2005 elections, yet the turnout is said to have been as high as 55%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/08/world/middleeast/08lebanon.html?_r=1|title=U.S.-Backed Alliance Wins in Lebanon|last=Slackman|first=Jack|date=7 June 2009|work=New York Times|quote=The tentative victory may have been aided by nearly unprecedented turnout.

Former US President [[Jimmy Carter]] with the [[Carter Center]] Observation Mission issued a report "[commending] the Lebanese people and the electoral authorities for the successful conduct of the 2009 parliamentary elections". The report stated that "Minister Baroud earned the confidence of Lebanese stakeholders through his commitment to a transparent process."  While the process fell short of several of Lebanon's international commitments, most notably secrecy of the ballot, they stated that "it was conducted with enhanced transparency." The report also commended the high levels of voter participation as well as the "high level of professionalism being exhibited by polling staff in most of the stations visited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/lebanon-statement-060809.html|title= Carter Center Commends Lebanon's Successful Elections; Notes Shortcomings and Encourages Continued Reform|date=8 June 2009|work=Carter Center Website| quote=The Carter Center commends the Lebanese people and the electoral authorities for the successful conduct of the 2009 parliamentary elections|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Carter Center final report can be found [http://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/peace/democracy/lebanon-final-060809.pdf here]. 
 
The [[European Union]], who also had established a mission to observe the 2009 Lebanese legislative elections, also issued a positive report stating that "the high level of trust in the electoral process was certainly assisted by the clear neutrality and professionalism of the Ministry of Interior in its administration of the elections, and especially by Minister Zyad [sic] Baroud himself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eueomlebanon.org/en/files/doc/1253861855_Rapport%20final%20EN%20OK.pdf |title=Lebanon Final Report Parliamentary Elections |date=7 June 2009 |work=European Union Election Observation Mission Website |quote=The high level of trust in the electoral process was certainly assisted by the clear neutrality and professionalism of the Ministry of Interior in its administration of the elections, and especially by Minister Zyad Baroud himself. |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that this neutrality is however not institutional, since it is more likely linked to the persona of Ziyad Baroud, and therefore "cannot be guaranteed for the next elections".

Furthermore, as head of the newly formed Elections Oversight Council (OSC) which had been charged with organizing all public elections in Lebanon, Baroud's performance rating in public office was second only to Lebanese President [[Michel Sleiman]] according to public opinion polls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.menassat.com/?q=en/news-articles/6540-lebanese-parliamentary-elections-who-s-monitoring Lebanese parliamentary elections: who’s monitoring?].

Lebanon stayed without a functioning government for the duration of four months, a time that was ridden with political wrangling over the formation of a [[national unity government]]. Eventually, the two sides finally agreed on the assignment of portfolios after concessions were made. 
Fifteen ministers were selected by the [[March 14 Alliance]], ten by the opposition [[March 8 Alliance]], and five were allotted to President [[Michel Sleiman]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8351651.stm|title=Lebanon finally forms government |date=(2009, 10 November)|work=BBC|accessdate=2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This formula denied 14 March from upholding a majority of cabinet posts while also preventing the opposition from exercising veto, a power which requires 11 cabinet posts (“a third plus one”). Thus, theoretically, the ministers selected by President Sleiman, considered impartial, hold the balance of power in cabinet with a swing vote on decision-making.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125780463967939649|title=Leaders of Lebanon Unveil Deal |last=Raad|first=Nada|date=10 November 2009|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ziyad Baroud was once again assigned as [[Minister of the Interior]] for a second term on 9 November 2009.

Due to the highly politicized and contentious atmosphere, Baroud's freedom of action as a Minister was severely reduced because of political wranglings he refused to get involved in. The contention between the 8 March and March 14 alliances often left him with no authority over policies and many of the security-related areas that he is supposed to constitutionally oversee, and eventually led to his resignation.

===Resignation from minister of interior post===
There are several conflicting accounts explaining what exactly happened the day that Ziyad Baroud resigned from his ministerial duties. The basic storyline, however, draws on a series of skirmishes that occurred in a one-day public showdown between different loyalists of the country's two conflicting parties of [[March 8 alliance|8 March]] and [[March 14 alliance|14 March]]. The dispute involved two different branches of the [[Internal Security Forces]] who had violated Minister Baroud's authority, and the Minister of Telecommunications [[Charbel Nahas]]. The dispute escalated into an 8 – 14 March diplomatic [[proxy war]] that was unlawfully fought on grounds belonging to Minister Baroud's jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yalibnan.com/2011/05/27/caretaker-interior-minister-ziad-baroud-quits/ Caretaker Interior Minister Ziad Baroud Quits].

The event was highly publicized. Television stations had caught the entire showdown on cameras. Nahas then accused the ISF and 14 March of plotting a “coup d’Etat” against the state, and asked the Lebanese army to intervene. Head of the Lebanese Internal Security Forces (ISF) [[Ashraf Rifi]] and 14 March responded by accusing the Telecommunications Ministry of launching a coup against the executive branch of the Lebanese government, their pretext being that the equipment at hand had been installed in 2007 by a directive ordained by the Lebanese government, and thus only cabinet-level authority were allowed to give directives to dismantle it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-akhbar.com/node/13382 The Unknown Story of the Telecommunications Network]. (27 May 2011). In ''Al-Akhbar''. Retrieved 10 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, that same day of 26 May 2011, Baroud announced that he would no longer continue his ministerial duties. He famously stated that he had just "witnessed, along with the Lebanese people, the breakdown of the Lebanese state"&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ZCvnSwyQdg Ziyad Baroud Resigns from Ministerial Duties] (27 May 2011). In ''YouTube''. Retrieved 10 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Baroud also said that he tried for three years to serve the country, but that there was no longer a reason to do so since the Constitution was being trespassed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almanar.com.lb/english/adetails.php?eid=17203&amp;frid=23&amp;seccatid=14&amp;cid=23&amp;fromval=1 Lebanese Interior Minister Ziad Baroud Resigns].

In his resignation speech, Baroud said: 
:''"I sought to be a servant of the Republic independent of any political affiliation despite the criticism and challenges, however, it was shown that the logic was missing elsewhere, and I realized, after attempting to prevent the explosion, that the problem is greater than its face value and I therefore refuse to be a false witness. 
:''Because I refuse to be a caretaker minister, whose role is limited to executing ministry tasks by signing off the ministry's ordinary mail, while the authority he constitutionally holds over certain directorates that report to him gets reduced to just a legal, broken text; 
:''Because disciplined behavior does not seem to reap any benefit anymore;'' 
:''Because I refuse that the Constitution be violated through the creation of such antecedents that give permission to anybody to collapse the powers of the Minister, be it any Minister;'' 
:''Because I will not take, nor have I ever taken, sides in a conflict that will carry the country to inevitable perils. I say all this independently of any lined political position, for the political team to which Minister [[Charbel Nahas]] belongs has not spared me, just like there is no rivalry between me and their opponent team but only cordiality and mutual respect with both teams.'' 
:''In light of all of the above, and in order for my presence at the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities not to be limited to processing mail or so, and since the Minister of Interior and Municipalities by proxy can carry out the management, or facilitation, of these tasks while safeguarding the interests of the people, I, therefore, declare my loyalty to the Constitution, with the law as my reference, and I say to the Lebanese people that taking them, or taking all of us, hostage is no longer acceptable. I have, thus, freed myself from being captive of this position, or whatever it has been transformed to, hoping that the language of wisdom shall govern all and save whatever remains of the power of the state, its institutions, and the civil peace that I so fear for."''&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

It is said that Baroud had come close to resigning on multiple occasions prior to this event, but was prevented from doing so by [[Michel Sleiman|President Sleiman]], who needed a trustworthy ally in this all-important ministry. The 26 May events, however, had proven to be too outrageous for Baroud to ignore, inducing him to resign on the spot.

The country was left feeling very uncomfortable with the idea of a military officer ignoring the directives of "perhaps the most popular civilian leader in the country."&lt;ref&gt;[http://qifanabki.com/2011/05/27/coup-coup-in-lebanon-minister-baroud-resigns-over-telecoms-isf-showdown/ Coup-Coup in Lebanon: Minister Baroud Resigns Over Telecoms-ISF Showdown].

==Image and social life==
Ziyad Baroud's close relation with the Lebanese public made him widely respected and admired by the people. He was accessible to all, and is known to have been one of the very few government officials who personally responded to emails sent by citizens. Baroud was often seen in public civilian settings going about his job, taking his own car at night to directly interact with traffic offenders. He would often stand at security check points in the late hours of the night and personally discuss the importance of speed limits and traffic laws with young speeders, and resultantly, send them to spend three days at the "Kun Hadi" association in order for them to understand the dangers they face and pose to others when they speed and violate traffic rules.

One famous anecdote, which was popularized by a blog, relates a December 2009 traffic incident describing Baroud's hands-on approach. It was the month of holidays, and Baroud was caught in one of the traffic jams as police tried to get a handle on the situation marking off roads that were to be closed for the following day's Beirut marathon. “Instead of sitting in his blacked out Mercedes – as you can bet dozens of other big cheeses and probably a handful of the political class were – Baroud took matters to hand. The Interior Minister, much to the obvious chagrin of his bodyguards, got out of his car, rolled up his shirtsleeves and started directing traffic himself.”&lt;ref name="Patrick Galey Blog"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://patrickgaley.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/goodbye-ziad-baroud-youll-be-missed/|title=GOODBYE ZIAD BAROUD, YOU’LL BE MISSED|last=Galey|first=Patrick|date=31 May 2011|work=Patrick Galey Blog|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As for his reputation within the ranks of officials, Baroud holds high esteem in the eyes of many decision makers in the country. [[Maronite Patriarch]] [[Bechara Boutros al-Rahi|Bechara Boutros Al-Rai]] once described Baroud as “a national minister and the hope for every Lebanese person. […] Nobody can relinquish him.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArchiveDetails.aspx?ID=255024#ixzz20t25D99b) Al-Rai: Nobody can dispense Baroud]. (27 March 2011). In ''NOW Lebanon'' Website. Retrieved 10 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroud is also very popular with political bloggers, both local and international. Upon his resignation, a hoard of encouraging blog articles flooded the Internet in support of Baroud's service and resignation decision.
